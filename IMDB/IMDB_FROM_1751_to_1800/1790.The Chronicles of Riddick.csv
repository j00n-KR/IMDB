0,TheLittleSongbird,"Striking visuals, but the script, character development and story weren't as impressive",5,21 June 2010,"Now I liked Pitch Black, it disturbed me when I first saw it, but it is a solid and underrated sci-fi- flick. I am not going to compare but this film wasn't as impressive. Starting with the good things, two things the two films have in common are that the visuals are truly striking and the special effects are fantastic. Here I liked the score, I for one found it quite atmospheric, the film started off really promisingly, Thandie Newton was quite an intriguing villainess and the editing was crisp. However, what didn't work for me was pretty much everything else. The plot makes little or no sense, the dialogue is clichéd and corny, the pacing is pedestrian, the direction is plodding and some of the character development is minimal or non-existent. The acting didn't fare much better either, I liked Vin Diesel in Pitch Black, but I found him too monosyllabic here, and I find the waste of Judi Dench unforgivable. Overall, overblown and underdeveloped, a disappointment. 5/10 Bethany Cox",The Chronicles of Riddick
1,Leofwine_draca,Would-be sci-fi epic is fun on a superficial level,6,9 February 2016,"THE CHRONICLES OF RIDDICK is a far cry from the tight, original, exciting B-movie PITCH BLACK, and not necessarily in a good way. Substituting visuals for suspense, this is a wannabe-epic on the level of STAR WARS, complete with loads of alien planets, space travels and a far-reaching plot. It's a distinctively average movie that is nevertheless worth watching for some okay action sequences and, of course, absolutely loads of special effects which are used to bring alien planets and races to life. The CGI backdrops are uniformly good, even if some scenes – like the Necromonger armies massing – are clearly taken from LORD OF THE RINGS. Additionally, the quality of design is at a high all round – from the elaborate, intrinsic sets to the costume design for the Necromonger army, which looks wicked.Unfortunately, the movie is saddled with Vin Diesel as the poor lead again; when will this guy stop making silly movies and earn some credibility in the action world? Vin Diesel is less charismatic than Schwarzenegger, and his morose, unfriendly hero never appeals to the audience. His fellow cast members range from Judi Dench (in it for the pay cheque alone, I guess) to Thandie Newton, whose Croydon facelift and overdone eyeshadow make her look ridiculous and extremely unattractive – and this is MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE 2's Thandie Newton we're talking about; I didn't think that would ever be possible. Karl Urban, always good value, has a major role as one of the bad guys, but he's given limited screen time. Kudos must go to scene-stealing Nick Chinlund, whose sweaty space-merc is as realistic as you'll find, beating Han Solo hands down.The movie always has plenty going on, and some elaborate action set-pieces help it rattle along quite nicely; Vin Diesel handles his tough-guy scenes well, especially his escape from a rope, which is brilliantly done. There are great ideas, like the sun being hot enough to burn people, and some good effects in a couple of alien monsters that turn red when lusting for blood. A notable martial art fight is edited to shy away from the violence, which is a shame, although the end fight is interesting and quite a lot of fun. The film does end abruptly though, like they just ran out of money, and I can't see a sequel following, so lots of loose ends are left untied.",The Chronicles of Riddick
2,SnoopyStyle,Way too complicated but love Crematoria,5,22 July 2014,"Riddick (Vin Diesel) is still on the run from bounty hunters. He travels to Helion Prime to the source of the bounty and finds the Imam (Keith David) who he saved 5 years earlier in the movie 'Pitch Black'. His planet is under threat from invasion from a dark force spreading across the Universe. Aereon (Judi Dench) is an Elemental who is looking for Furyan warriors who can stand up to the Necromongers led by Lord Marshal (Colm Feore). The other survivor Jack had gone to look for Riddick and is now imprisoned on the roasting planet Crematoria. When the Necromongers attack the planet, Riddick escapes from the Necromongers and allows himself to be captured by bounty hunter Toombs (Nick Chinlund) He is sent to Crematoria where he reunites with Jack now called Kyra (Alexa Davalos). Riddick escapes with Kyra to the planet's sun ravaged surface. Lord Marshal sends Necromonger warrior Vakko (Karl Urban) and his wife Dame Vakko (Thandie Newton) to kill Riddick.I wish Rhiana Griffith could have returned but it's understandable to have a new Jack. She's a new age and basically a completely different character. The movie has a lot of big design. Some of it looks good. The problem is that the story is way too complicated. There are too many moving parts. The genius of the first movie is that the story is so simplistic. I wish it could use the same simplicity for this one. I really love the planet Crematoria. It would have been so much better to streamline the story to escape from Crematoria. All the stuff about Necromonger just mess things up. They could have set them up for a later movie. There's no need to pack so much into one movie.",The Chronicles of Riddick
3,claudio_carvalho,"Excellent Sci-Fi Adventure and Sequel of the Cult-Movie ""Pitch Black""",8,27 February 2005,"Five years after the events related in ""Pitch Black"", the Furyan fugitive Riddick (Vin Diesel) is hunted by mercenaries, hired by Abu 'Imam' al-Walid (Keith David) of New Mecca, as the last hope of the universe against the Necromongers. This evil breed, leaded by Lord Marshal (Colm Feore), converts or eliminates the human as part of the plan of conquering the universe. Aereon (Judi Dench), an ambassador from the Elemental race, tries o convince the also evil Riddick to save the human race. ""The Chronicles of Riddick"" is a movie with flaws, cliché, even it is brainless, as most of the movies of this genre, and it will certainly not receive an Oscar nomination. However, for its proposal of entertainment, it is an excellent sci-fi adventure and sequel of the cult ""Pitch Black"". The story is narrated in off, and Vin Diesel's voice is magnificent in this aspect. In the DVD, Vin Diesel also presents the set, were most of the story takes place, and it is interesting to see the illusion of the cinema. I believe that fans of sci-fi action movies like me will love ""The Chronicles of Riddick"", which is underrated in IMDb. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""A Batalha de Riddick"" (""The Battle of Riddick"")",The Chronicles of Riddick
4,kosmasp,A new era,7,13 September 2013,"I think people were expecting more of the same back in 2004 when this came as a successor to the popular ""Pitch Black"". Which also made more than decent money in the box office, which of course brought studios to the plan to make (and ""help"") with the sequel. Maybe it's not entirely the studios to blame and the finished product isn't as bad as I heard it was back then.Maybe people were expecting something different. Watching this now (in preparation for the newest installment in the Riddick saga), I thought it was quite good. I only watched the extended cut though, so I can't say how it played in the cinemas. I waited long enough for this moment, because they had announced a third movie back then and I though I'd wait for it, before watching this. Well the wait is over and the movies do have a storyline that is coherent and is building on the time-line of the previous movies.Of course even people who haven't seen the original can watch this, because you'll get the story in a nutshell (conversation between two characters from part 1). Still watch them in chronological order if you can. And watch the deleted scenes if you get the disc ... it's a nice little hint to something that happens in part 3. Something they couldn't do (money/time issues) here, they picked up for the next one ... Now I might get to the video games and the animated features they did. Riddick is intriguing indeed! And Vin Diesel plus Twohy did build something great there!",The Chronicles of Riddick
5,classicsoncall,"""Are you gonna stop the new monsters now?""",7,12 November 2018,"It's dark, dystopian, futuristic, apocalyptic, and ultimately..., quite boring. That is if you've seen any number of universe spanning, sci-fi action adventure flicks. It's probably the case that I have because I was just worn out with the picture at the half way point and couldn't wait for it to be over. Until I came to the review pages I didn't know that this was a sequel to a movie titled ""Pitch Black"", but knowing that now I'm not really compelled to seek out the prior picture. This one does do a fine job in the special effects area but that's not enough. How about well developed characters and a creative story line. Vin Diesel is pretty much a one note action hero here, going up against a whole slew of one note, villainous adversaries. It's little comfort that the most well rounded character in the entire lot was the mercenary Toombs (Nick Chinlund); all the armor coated Necromongers seemed interchangeable to me. And by the way - 'Necromongers'?, 'Underverse'?, 'Helion'?, 'Crematoria'?, Who wrote this stuff? It's really not too surprising that the film had a budget of over a hundred million and returned just about half that. The goal is to do it the other way around.",The Chronicles of Riddick
6,jboothmillard,The Chronicles of Riddick,2,30 March 2009,"Pitch Black, from what I remember, was a very good science fiction thriller with good action and special effects, and it is much better compared to this piece of rubbish. This sequel takes place five years after the events of the previous, where Riddick (Razzie nominated Vin Diesel), now being hunted, is caught in the middle of a crusade type war. I could not make any real sense of what was going on, apart from Dame Vaako (Thandie Newton) was the villain, along with Lord Marshal (Colm Feore), and Aereon (Dame Judi Dench) is some woman that can vanish and foresee the future. As before Riddick is the anti-hero trying both to save himself, but he seems to be saving others on his path of both escape and rescue for the human race. Also starring Karl Urban as Vaako, Linus Roache as Purifier, Keith David as Imam, Yorick Van Wageningen as The Guv, Alexa Davalos as Kyra and Nick Chinlund as Toombs. Like the Star Wars prequels, this is chockablock with both complicated and ridiculous dialogue about religion and politics, and not even the special effects can save this film from being a complete flop, and one of the most boring films I have ever seen. Pretty poor!",The Chronicles of Riddick
7,Tweekums,A somewhat confused follow up to 'Pitch Black',6,30 January 2017,"A militaristic cult, the Necromongers, is sweeping through a series of planets; the people of those planets are given a choice; convert or die. Riddick, having survived the events in 'Pitch Black' has been in hiding for the past five years but mercenaries have now caught up with him. He beats them and takes their ship and heads to New Mecca to find the man who employed them; the Imam he had saved. Here he meets Aereon, an Air Elemental, who tells him about the Necromongers. They soon arrive and take over the planet and Riddick kills one of their best men before being captured. Later their leader discovers that Riddick is a Furyan; a warrior race who have been prophesied to kill him so orders his death. He escapes and is promptly caught by the mercenaries who take him to the prison planet Cremetoria; a world where the daytime is over 700 degrees and the night time is well below freezing. Here he finds the girl he saved in 'Pitch Black' and once again starts to plan an escape while the Necromongers are closing in on them.Having enjoyed 'Pitch Black', which I found genuinely scary I was optimistic that this would be pretty good too. Unfortunately while it isn't bad it is nowhere near as good. In many ways it feels like a film that just happens to feature the same protagonist rather than a sequel. The story is somewhat confused; it felt as though the creators came up with a variety of ideas they wanted to include then struggled to find a good way to justify their inclusion. The Necromongers weren't as threatening as they should have been; at no point did I feel Riddick was in any real danger. There special effects are fairly obvious CGI for the most part. There is some good action at times and I liked Alexa Davalos's performance as Kyra; it was better than some more well-known actors. Overall I'd say this is an okay main-in-neutral film; certainly not a must see unless you are s serious Vin Diesel fan.",The Chronicles of Riddick
8,ma-cortes,"A nice and nail-biting sequel that will keep you on the edge of your seat , being well starred and splendily directed",7,22 October 2018,"Intriguing as well as intelligent Sci-fi movie , being compellingly directed by a good filmmaker , David Twohy . It stars an awesome cast : Colm Feore , Thandie Newton , Judi Dench , Alexa Davalos , Karl Urban , Linus Roache and Keith David . Exciting film packs intrigue , intense scenes , noisy action , chills and astonishing suspense . In this is a science fiction thriller Riddick (breakthrough film role of actor Vin Diesel) is at an unknown planet with various suns and apparently no life and where mysterious events spread across the land , he is a survivor who is marooned on a strange location and an aircraft piloted by a bounty hunter called Toombs (Nick Chinlund) goes after him . Then Riddick arrives on a planet called Helion Prime, and finds himself up against an invading empire called the Necromongers, whose leader is a warrior priest who is the chief of a sect with a powerful army commanded by Lord Marshal (Colm Feore) , his ominous deputy (Karl Urban) and commander-in-chief (Linus Roache) , that plan to convert or kill all humans by using freak deadly storm over the planets . This is a decent sequel titled ¨The chronicles of Riddick¨ (2004) in which the wanted criminal Riddick arrives on a planet called Helion Prime full of bloodthirsty creatures and finds himself up against an invading empire . But then , they learn that a merciless enemy is about to appear .The greatest danger facing our starring has been the planet's best kept secret...until now . Later on , the ominous Necromongers to be aware the Riddick's arrival at night . There Riddick meets an ethereal being , Aereon (Judi Dench) , an ambassador from the Elemental race who helps him to vanquish the nasty Necromangers .Fast-moving , creepy , and gory Sci-Fi with thrills , chills , suspense and some familiar elements from the previous outing . This is a pretty good as well as scary movie with violent events ,thrills , intriguing incidents , starked outdoors , and chilling scenes . Interesting screenplay from Jim Wheat , Ken Wheat and David Twohy , dealing with Riddick battling the hideous invaders called the Necromongers, with an army that schemes to murder the population in the world , though the character of Riddick was a woman in an early rough draft of the script. The Pitch Black (2000) original film was supposed to be a standalone film. But, during production, Vin Diesel, and the cast and crew had become intrigued by the character of Riddick, and the ending, in which Riddick was supposed to die, was changed, so a possible sequel with Vin Diesel returning as Riddick could happen. The film spawned three sequels, Dark fury (animated) , Chronicles of Riddick (2004) and Riddick (2013). Vin Diesel gives a hard-ass acting , as usual , as an escaped convict with a bounty on his head who has nothing to lose .The contact lenses Vin Diesel wore in the movie, while a prototype during production, were briefly available to the public from Lens Quest following the release of the film . Diesel said that while shooting the scenes where his character was in a suspended animation , he had a claustrophobia attack at one point during shooting and had to be taken out of the chamber. Nice support cast such as Colm Feore , Karl Urban ,Thandie Newton, Judi Dench , Chistina Cox ,Yorick van Wageningen , Linus Roache and again the beautiful Alexa Davalos . It was given a ""PG-13¨ for intense sequences of violent action , profanity and some bad language. An unrated version, with more violence and language was later released. The fantastic creatures and various monsters were perfectly designed by Patrick Tatopoulos and excellent production design , as the Necromonger statues are based on the sculptures of Adolfo Wildt.
Besides , hundreds of extras went through basic military training and drills for added uniformity and realism. Thrilling and stirring musical score by Graeme Revell . Colorful cinematography by Hugh Johnson , replacing David Eggby, he shows splendidly the bizarre landscapes from Burnaby , Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada and New Deal studios , Los AngelesThe motion picture was well written and directed by David Twohy , it had a 60 days shooting schedule. David is an expert writer and director of competent Sci-Fi movies . As his first picture was the acceptable ¨Timescape¨ . He also wrote ¨Warlock¨, ¨Waterworld ¨, a script for ¨Alien 3¨ in 1988, but it was rejected . Back in May of 2000 , Fox Studios once inquired for his availability to write and direct ""AVP: Alien vs. Predator"" , but turned down the offer due to scheduling conflicts . David subsequently directed ¨Below¨, the successful ¨Pitch Black¨ with Radha Mitchell , Cole Hauser , Claudia Black , Lewis Fitzgerald , Simon Burke , John Moore and Keith David . Furthermore , a third installment : ¨Riddick¨ (2013) in which left for dead on a sun-scorched planet, Riddick finds himself up against an alien race of predators , it stars : Jordi Mollà , Katee Sackhoff , Dave Bautista , Matt Nable , Bokeem Woodbine , Raoul Trujillo , Conrad Pla , and , of course , Vin Diesel .",The Chronicles of Riddick
9,sunwarrior13,Just A Matter Of Production Design,7,5 November 2011,"The Chronicles of Riddick is a science fiction film which follows the adventures of Richard B. Riddick, as he attempts to elude capture after the events depicted in the 2000 film Pitch Black, and details his meeting with Jack and Imam, his escape from the prison planet Crematoria, and his battle with the Necromonger fleet. It stars Vin Diesel,reprising his role as Riddick, together with Karl Urban,Alexa Davalos,Thandie Newton, Colm Feore, Judi Dench, and Keith David.It was directed by David Twohy.The Chronicles of Riddick has Vin Diesel returning as the Riddick in this sequel to Pitch Black. Riddick, on the run from the law and evading mercenaries eager to claim the price on his head, seeks refuge on the planet of Helion, only to discover he's walked into a world in chaos. Helion has been seized by the Lord Marshall, leader of the Necromongers, a race of bloodthirsty warriors determined to wipe out humanity throughout the universe. Aereon, leader of Helion's ""elementals,"" pleads with Riddick to join them in their fight for survival; Riddick agrees, hoping to fill out some of the blank chapters in his history along the way. As he plots his battle strategy against the Necromongers, Riddick becomes reacquainted with Kyra,whom he knew as a girl but has since grown into a strong and beautiful woman eager to join him in the fight against the Lord Marshall.The Chronicles of Riddick offers many thrills as an action film but it does not hold a candle to Pitch Black.It was a very violent movie trying to demonstrate its visuals and special effects.Inspite of the comic book energy, and the eye-popping production design by Holger Gross,there is a lot more desired to the story.Overall,The Chronicles of Riddick tries to impress us with its production design rather than tell a story with character development and an interesting plot.",The Chronicles of Riddick
10,LeonLouisRicci,Over Indulgent Clunk,5,4 January 2014,"A Misstep of Gargantuan Proportion is this Mega-Million Dollar follow-up to Director/Writer David Twohy's Low-Budget Cult Favorite Pitch Black (2000). It has a Look that could be called Steampunk Clunk and the Title Character is not much of a Driving Force for such a Large Piece of Space Junk. He mumbles One-Liners in the midst of some Flowery Prose and Dialog about Necro-Somethings, Soul Stealing, and Planet Zapping.Its just too much about not much and its Star cannot Match the Enormous Sets and Overblown Production. Things move Fast, especially the Action Scenes where, again, Hollywood seems to think that all this Quick Cutting and Camera Waving is Exciting Audiences with Adrenaline Pumping Visuals, when in Reality it only makes them reach for the Dramamine.The Film is not completely Awful although it tries hard to come Very Close. Vin Diesel cannot Act and is nothing more than Beef on a Stick in the Stallone Tradition. The Script is Overwritten and Relentlessly Confusing and at times Simply Dumb with the Quips and the Fancy Sci-Fi Jargon competing for Razzberries.The Move is Over-Costumed and all Over the Place, but somehow in all its Badness manages to be Watchable at Times but it is a Deer in the Headlights Thing.",The Chronicles of Riddick
11,poolandrews,OK sci-fi action but nothing to get too excited about.,5,14 February 2008,"The Chronicles of Riddick starts as escaped convict Riddick (producer Vin Diesel) evades a group of mercenaries who are out to capture him & collect the bounty on his head, stealing their spaceship Riddick heads for the planet Helion Prime where he seeks out Imam (Keith David) the only person who could have revealed his location. Imam tells Riddick of a race called the Necromongers lead by a ruthless Lord Marshal (Colin Feore) who travel from planet to planet converting the human population to their religion & destroying anyone who refuses, Helion Prime is next on their list. Riddick isn't interested & deliberately gets captured by mercenaries who take him to the prison planet Crematoria where Riddick intends to find & escape with Jack, now known as Kyra (Alexa Davalos). However the Necromonger Grand Marshal is afraid of Riddick & sets out to kill him...Written & directed by David Twohy The Chronicles of Riddick was the sequel to the fairly entertaining sci-fi horror flick Pitch Black (2000) & in my opinion isn't as good a film. Released theatrically & then as the obligatory extended 'Director's Cut' on DVD I will be basing my comment on the shorter theatrical version. The script by Twohy seems to want to totally forget about & distance itself from the original, even the films name is totally different. In Pitch Black the emphasis was on a group of character's surviving an onslaught by flesh eating monsters & was a good solid horror flick but here in The Chronicles of Riddick the makers try to base an entire film around the central character of Riddick which just didn't work for me. Everything that happens is based around him, the fact that he is the only one who can kill the Lord Marshal, I mean one guy in the entire Universe? There are lots of silly looking people with silly names saying really silly lines of dialogue & trying to look either cool or menacing & it just didn't work for me. This isn't a film as much as a computer game, nothing feels real, I couldn't relate to anyone or anything, the fight scenes are gravity defying & are just a little bit too far fetched for me & this Riddick is is practically invincible even against the Necromongers who number in their millions! The parallels between the Necromongers & the Nazi's are hard to miss with their ethnic & religious cleansing only here in The Chronicles of Riddick it spans an entire Universe. Also I think the motivation behind the Necromongers evils plans are somewhat flimsy, I kept asking myself why? Why destroy the entire Universe?The production design on The Chronicles of Riddick is impressive as it should be with all the money spent on it, it's a sort of mixture of futuristic & Gothic styles although although it can look a bit silly at times. The action & fight scenes a little disappointing as they are fairly choppily edited & sometimes it's a bit hard to follow whats going on. The amount of CGI computer effects work on The Chronicles of Riddick is astonishing, is there a single scene in this film which doesn't have a CGI effect in it? When I said The Chronicles of Riddick resembled a computer game I wasn't kidding. Far & away the best sequence is on the surface of Crematoria where Riddick & co have to race across it as the hot rays of the planets sun begin to engulf it, it's a nice idea as well & I liked the makers actually using the planets life-cycle itself for an action set-piece.With a supposed budget of about $110,000,000 The Chronicles of Riddick looks pretty good although some of the CGI work isn't entirely convincing. The production values are high though & it has that big budget Hollywood look & feel about it. The acting is very forced & very posed as everyone seems very self conscious to look cool, threatening or imposing. I'm not sure what respected British actress Dame Judi Dench is doing in it though.The Chronicles of Riddick is a very different film to the claustrophobic original Pitch Black & just about alters everything that made that film so enjoyable for me, this is just a huge big budget CGI computer effect interplanetary soap opera that focuses entirely on the Riddick character. It's not a bad film, it entertains & moves along at a decent pace but it left me cold & wanting more. Followed by the animated adventure The Chronicles of Riddick: Dark Fury (2004) which is actually set between the Pitch Black & The Chronicles of Riddick films.",The Chronicles of Riddick
12,CinemaSerf,Riddick-ulous sci-fi stuff...,6,15 July 2020,"This is very much a vehicle for Vin Diesel to flex his muscles and engage in 2 hours of kick-ass adventure. The plot is pretty unimportant: ""Riddick"" arrives on a planet and is soon hired by Dame Judi Dench to go up against the brutal ""Necromongers"" - a sort of intergalactic cricket led by Colm Feore, who are hell bent on destroying humanity. After quite a long, slow, start it does not hang about; we have loads of decent special effects as he is double-crossed, imprisoned and ultimately joined with Karl Urban and Thandie Newton to take on the army of locust-like beasties. It's not the best of the ""Riddick"" films, but it has a good cast and a half-decent story to keep it off the rocks.

Hauled back to civilization to help fight an evil invading army Riddick has other things on his mind...To say that the movie that was promised in the trailers was not the movie that ended up on the screen is to say a great deal. The trailers make things out to be much more straight forward than they are, this isn't a bad thing since it leaves the viewer surprised a great deal. I'm certain that those disappointed with the film will probably find that they like it better on a second or third viewing when they can truly see what director David Twohy had in mind.I love this movie. I've just seen it and I'm happier than I've been about a pure adventure film in a very long time. It is what it is and its going to take  its own wonderful route getting there. I love that things aren't explained or that things don't go as expected. I love the performances and the back stabbing nature of some of the characters.I want to see it again, right now, which is tough since as I type this its well after one in the morning and there are no shows.All I can say is see this movie and take it for what it is, a big sprawling science fiction epic of the sort they only ever did in novels. I can only compare it to the epics such as Dune or other massive space operas. I'm certain that was Twohy's intention since the names and designs echo earlier books and films.Its a popcorn movie of the highest order. It moves and grooves and has witty comebacks.See this movie. Even if you don't like it the first time, try it a second time since I'm reasonably certain that once you see it as it is and not what you think it is you'll have found a film to revisit again and again.Okay, the end bit is a tad rushed, but I still give it a ten with two thumbs up.",The Chronicles of Riddick

I heard that there was a movie before this one and this is like the sequel, maybe I should have watched it first. The movie just kind of started and continued going until the end. The entire time I was wondering how mankind got to that point. Who was Riddick? Where were they? And there were a lot of other questions I had about the whole picture. It could have been explained somewhere in the midst of the rhetoric and I missed it, but I doubt it. There was not enough plot development or character development for me to completely get into the movie. I found myself not caring one way or the other if Riddick killed the bad guy in the end; and it didn't help that Vin Diesel, the new Sylvester Stallone, was playing Riddick.",The Chronicles of Riddick
15,neil-476,Surprising,8,28 April 2010,"This movie was something of a surprise. Having been impressed by the claustrophobic horror movie dressed up as science fiction which was Pitch Black, I was expecting either more of the same or, at least, a variation on the theme. Instead, I got fullblown space opera - multiple planets and interstellar war. Oh, and Macbeth.Well, I love fullblown space opera, so that was OK by me. And I also have a soft spot for Macbeth, too.I suppose I should have realised. Vin Diesel's Riddick is a character whose backstory means that he could, and does, find himself anywhere and, on this occasion, he finds himself having to chose sides between all-powerful conquerors (the Necromongers) and the conquered (everybody else), while trying to avoid being recaptured by bounty hunters.The story is moderately complex but relatively easy to follow (although it helps if you have seen Pitch Black before so that you know who two of the characters are - they are never explained within this movie). The different locations are very well realised, as are the various spacecraft and the overall Necromonger look.Diesel, not the worlds' greatest actor, commands the screen, and the supporting cast are all excellent (with a special nod, as ever, to Judi Dench, upping the class quotient a couple of notches).This is decent science fiction for those leaning towards being grown up.",The Chronicles of Riddick

Being a big fan of the first film AND the x-box game, I was psyched. Needless to say, I was let down GREATLY. This film lacks any of the atmosphere that made the first one a modern day classic (save for a few scenes on the surface of Cremotaria) This film apes a GREAT many movies: When we first see Riddick he looks like Gary Oldman from ""True Romance"", when we leave him it's in the same way as Conan the Barbarian (I half expected Mako himself to narrate us off camera), and in between there are allusions to many others. The makers were going for EPIC, but fell short. Now I'm for good brainless escapist fare, but I have to emphasize the GOOD part. It's saying something when the videogame has a better storyline than the actual movie does. Granted if I didn't have such high expectations and if they didn't cut the action scenes to ribbons to get a PG-13 I MAY have liked it more.My Grade: C-",The Chronicles of Riddick
17,Aaron1375,"Not a great movie, but still a somewhat good sci-fi flick.",7,13 June 2004,"Here, as in the case with another 2004 release ""Van Helsing"", we have a movie that has good action, but kind of a jumbled plot.  In fact, this one makes ""Van Helsing's"" plot seem a bit better.  Still though it was worth it to see a science fiction action movie that does not have Star Wars in the title.  Without Vin Diesel though this one would have been even weaker. Another movie where it is turn off your brain and enjoy the special effects and the action.  One of my problems is the villains in this one.  They really should have gotten somebody famous to play the lead villain. Instead, they waste money getting Dame Judi Dench to play a rather pointless character.  They also do not spend enough time developing the main villain, instead choosing to waste time on these other two characters plotting against the main villain.  Then there is the character that comes out of nowhere with shocking news.  Still though it was enjoyable enough and it was in fact a sequel to ""Pitch Black"" not a prequel.  If you like seeing some good fights and stuff blowing up then this is a good flick.  If you are expecting some great story then I would suggest you watch something else.",The Chronicles of Riddick

I'm certainly not a fan of Vin Diesel - in fact, I've hated everything else I've seen him (with the exception of Pitch Black, which was 'good') - but like most bad actors, he proves here that even he can be good if given the right material. And the role of the illusive 'Riddick' is definitely right for him. While I don't like his acting or general attitude - I have to concede that he LOOKS cool, and his role here confirms that. The plot follows Riddick five years after the events of Pitch Black. Now sporting a full head of long hair and a beard (all of which gets shaved), Riddick finds himself with a bounty on his head. After dispatching the bounty hunters, our hero goes straight to the source...where he finds that the evil Necromongers are planning to recruit the rest of the Universe into their 'religion', and he may be the only one to bring them down.The main reason this film is such a good time is that, rather than just concentrating on the main character, the film blends in many different sub-plots, along with a lot of things that aren't particularly relevant to the main narrative - and it's these things that make sure the audience is always on the edge of the seat, begging for more. The central narrative is generally exciting, but the secondary ones actually offer a bit more. The Macbeth-style sub-plot with the Necromongers being the best of the secondary plots. The special effects are pretty much entirely computer generated; but this isn't a problem, as The Chronicles of Riddick does an absolutely incredible job of setting itself in another galaxy. Completely creating another world must be difficult, and many films fail at it. This one doesn't. Even the acting isn't at all bad. As mentioned, Vin Diesel is in his element - and his support, coming from lesser-known actors like Karl Urban, Colm Theore, Alexa Davalos and Thandie Newton is more than adequate. Surprisingly enough, there's even room for Judy Dench. I've heard that Vin Diesel is after making a trilogy of Riddick filmsand I for one hope he does. On the whole - I can see why this film isn't universally liked. Sci-fi epics aren't for everyone - but this one is definitely for me. Even if you don't think you'll like it...give Riddick a try.",The Chronicles of Riddick
19,KineticSeoul,More bigger and grand-scale doesn't necessarily mean better,4,2 October 2013,"I personally didn't find this movie to be engaging or as entertaining as ""Pitch Black"". Sure some people claim it's not fair to compare the two movies. But this one is just bland in almost every way. Just because the sequel is more bigger and grand-scale doesn't make it a better movie. The story picks up after 5 years after the incident in ""Pitch Black"". It starts off alright but it just quickly becomes a boring narrow step by step movie. Narrow movies can work, especially with the entertainment value but this one is just disappointing. And lacks that essence to pull the audiences into the worlds and the characters. The story is kind of like ""God of War 2"", about a badass that is trying to defy a empire that is a sci-fi mix between Rome and Egypt. That is terrorizing other planets and Riddick, decides to fight for the cause for freedom. This movie has 3 stages with a disappointing climax. The first is him on the run and trying to figure things out while trying to get the bounty off his back. While seeing the struggles of the planet's people by Necromongers. They are basically the people that killed off most of the Furyan race. Thus just only handful of survivors are left including Riddick. The second stage is Riddick going to a space prison and escaping. The 3rd stages it the most disappointing one where Riddick has a disappointing showdown with the Necromongers leader. Personally, I think just a straight up direction with Riddick building up power and taking on the Necromongers with strategy, tactic, wits and skills. Would have been more entertaining to at least watch. Plus the most disappointing of all. Is how Riddick's character and demeanor seems more like a hero and not much of a anti-hero. This isn't a bad sequel but just disappointing and lacked the elements that made ""Pitch Black"" awesome. Vin Diesel still does a amazing job playing Riddick, but that is about it.4.5/10",The Chronicles of Riddick
20,Buddy-51,"strong visuals, weak everything else",4,30 October 2005,"In this top-heavy and bloated sequel to ""Pitch Black,"" Vin Deisel plays a top-heavy and bloated antihero whose job it is to defeat an army of half-dead warriors bent on taking over the universe.At 135 minutes, ""The Chronicles of Riddick"" is an interminable mélange of derivative mythology, mind-numbing dialogue and uniformly wooden acting, made bearable only by the breathtaking design and look of the film. Diesel sleepwalks through the part of Riddick, barely managing to sputter out even the few paltry lines of dialogue the screenwriter have seen fit to assign to him. About the only point of interest in the otherwise dull and tedious enterprise is why the classy Judi Dench chose this particular neighborhood to go slumming in.",The Chronicles of Riddick
21,bowmanblue,"Great fun, but probably always destined to fail",7,25 February 2015,"The Chronicles of Riddick was probably always going to be a hard sell. It's a sequel that was spawned off the back of a blatant B-movie which - somehow - exceeded all expectations and became a sleeper classic, ie. Pitch Black.Chronicles of Riddick is set five years after space convict Riddick escaped the last prison transport (and a planet full of monsters) and has now found himself not only hunted by mercenaries but also charged with the task of bringing down an empire of intergalactic nasties.Personally, I quite enjoyed it. It has great action, some witty dialogue from Riddick himself and decent (if a little too CGI) special effects.However, it's worth noting that it didn't perform as well as it was predicted at the Box Office. I'm guessing that was because it doesn't really seem to know what sort of film it wants to be. Its predecessor, Pitch Black, was an out and our sci-fi horror. Chronicles waters down the fear factor in exchange for a lower rating (in order to draw more younger viewers in) which annoyed its core fanbase. Plus there's only ever really Riddick to root for. He works alone and this is proved by the fact that he barely ever meets up with 'a gang' so to speak of. He just goes from planet to planet, briefly interacting with one set of locals after another. Then you have the baddies. Yes, the costumes and sets are great, but they're pretty clichéd and one dimensional. Ooh, a Bristish bad guy - there's a shock.All in all, Riddick is fun, but the bottom line is that it's little more than a remake of the eighties (so-bad-it's-good) classic Flash Gordon, only with better special effects.",The Chronicles of Riddick
22,MLDinTN,what a mess,2,11 May 2005,"I like the character Riddick and that is the only positive thing I can say about this convoluted mess of a film. The story, at least what I could make of it, was terrible. This must have been one of the worst scripts ever. And the special effects were too much. It looked more like a video game with no substance. At times, it looked like the actors were standing in front of the blue screen and you could tell easily.Back to the script, so much of it makes no sense. From Riddick going to see the Holy man to knowing where Jack was. Like in the beginning, is there only one city on the planet the Holy man lives? And Riddick happens to be there when it gets invaded. Also when did Riddick start flying through the air like the ridiculous stunts of Charlie Angels or Jet Li movies.Also, what was the point of Judy Dench except a famous name. Thandie Newton had a terrible character also. It was just bad.FINAL VERDICT: After this, surely they won't spend the money to make two sequels. And I'm a Vin Diesel fan, but I can't recommend this. Watch Pitch Black again if you can't get enough Riddick.",The Chronicles of Riddick

There are plenty of great action, workable CGI effects, and very good set designs.Vin Diesel returns as Riddick and after being hunted by mercenaries, he once again has to save mankind from a group of Necromancers who wants to convert the human race or destroy them.As Roger Ebert puts it, Vin Diesel was born to play this role. I agree with that statement. I would be disappointed if anyone else played this role.

25,CuriosityKilledShawn,Better than Pitch Black,6,1 September 2005,"A review of the Director's Cut As incredibly silly as it is, TCOR is actually entertaining enough for the running time to breeze by without you realising. Afterwards though you'll notice how desperately it wants to be the next Dune. It comes across as a futuristic Conan instead. Which isn't bad. The director's cut beefs-up the storyline with more established characters and small scenes to make for sense of previously disorientating sub-plots.Richard B. Riddick (Mark 'Silly Voice' Vincent in the only role he seems natural in) has been hunted by mercenaries ever since the events in Dark Fury (a surprisingly good animated short bridging the gap between Pitch Black and this) and has been cornered on a snow-covered planet by relentless bounty hunter Toombs. Not taking kindly to being captured, Riddick nicks his spaceship and sets off across the galaxy to find Imam (the super-cool Keith David) to settle a score. Once on Imam's home planet of Helion Prime a supernatural race of half-dead Space Nazis called the Necromongos, or something, show up and start killing everyone. Just because they're like that. Yes, it's a rather stupid plot but it's about as silly as the whole film gets. The rest is far above this.Riddick legs it again but is caught once more by Toombs and thrown into a hellish prison on a remote, hellish planet. Do you think he can escape and save what's left of Helion Prime? I must say I was disappointed that Riddick was portrayed as a hero this time round. Judi Dench's character describes him as 'a different kind of evil' but I never found him to be that way. Self-serving he may well be but I never got the impression that he was a baddie forced into doing good things.The story structure to TCOR is rather episodic and comes in three distinct acts. Each one giving us a new situation and loads of imagination. You can't fault David Twohy for giving us a dull franchise with his Chronicles of Riddick. The faultless SFX don't ever come across as indulgent as they seriously help create a convincing universe teeming with life. Even in just over 2 hours enough is established to make loads of little movies.Since the movie bombed I don't think we'll be seeing more of Riddick in the near-future. It's a shame because one Riddick film every 2 years (ala James Bond) would have been actually quite appealing.",The Chronicles of Riddick

All the characters are awesome, and the story is really cool, plus Vin Diesel is simply amazing in this!. The effects are fantastic, and the film is very exciting throughout, plus it's very well made and written as well. Riddick has to be one of the coolest characters I have ever seen, and I really hope they go along with the planned trilogy, plus the finale is especially well done. To be quite honest I wasn't expecting much from this due to being very disappointed by Pitch Black, however what I got was an excellent sequel, that was everything Picth Black wasn't, plus Vin had great chemistry with Alexa Davalos(Kyra). The ending was very surprising for me as I did not see any of that coming, and I thought the opening was really cool, plus Karl Urban is great in his role. Colm Feore played a great villain, and one of my favorite moments in the film is when Vin is about to be attacked by this weird animal creature, and he tames it, and Vin says ""I have a thing with animals"". This is excellent entertainment that makes up for the disappointing Pitch Black in my opinion, with top notch action,and an amazing performance from Vin Diesel, and I say it's a must see for everyone!. The Direction is excellent!. David Twohy does an excellent! job here with fantastic camera work, great angles, awesome visual effects, and plenty of other neat shots as well, plus he kept the film at an extremely fast pace. The Acting is a lot of fun!. Vin Diesel is amazing as always and is amazing here, he is just such a lovable bad ass, looked so cool, had some wicked looking eyes, was very likable, kicked that ass, had a great relationship with Davalos,looked in tip top shape, and has created a fantastic character here! (Vin Rules!!!!!!). Colm Feore played a really cool villain here as Lord Marshall, he was menacing, and looked pretty cool, I dug him. Thandie Newton is somewhat sexy and played her role well, as Urban's wife. Karl Urban was especially cool here, he had an intense look on his face throughout and had an unpredictable character, he was great. Judi Dench is good with what she had to do, which was not much but to show up here and there, she brought class though. Alexa Davalos is fantastic as Kyra, I really enjoyed the relationship between her and Vin, she can also kick ass with the best of them, I loved her!.

27,Platypuschow,The Chronicles of Riddick: I see why it flopped,3,15 October 2018,"I thought Pitch Black (2000) was a competently made movie and though it didn't exactly blow me away it did impress me to an extent.Cashing in on it's popularity seemed like good business, but ironically that was literally the opposite of what it turned out to be.The Chronicles of Riddick is one of those strange beasts that was pretty much critically acclaimed and has masses of fans, but financially it bombed and bombed big time.The movie see's our oddly eyed hero on another adventure, this time with the fate of billions at stake and possibly a foe from his past rearing their head.With a stellar cast and a budget of just over 100 million this should have been something considerably more impressive than it was.Riddled with cliches, over-acting and hammy performances from the likes of Diesel and the usually excellent Feore, and honestly very little going for it I was astounded just how crappy the film looked in places. How can a movie with this level of budget have moments of such utter tosh cgi?I get the appeal of Riddick, I just don't like the universe that he resides in. Sure I'm not a big sci-fi guy so immediatly it was at a disadvantage but I still recognise quality and this wasn't it.The Good:Nick Chinlund & Alexa Davalos The Bad:There is something about this type of film I can never take seriouslySome weirdly poor cgiVery underwhelming stuffThings I Learnt From This Movie:Women see greatness in men who beat themI can't take that one actor seriously anymore, everytime I see him I think of him drunkenly singing in the postroom with Buddy the elf",The Chronicles of Riddick
28,The-Sarkologist,Riddick vs the Necromongers,7,28 April 2020,"I'm in two minds about this film actually. I do get the impression that a lot of people didn't like it because it had diverged quite significantly from Pitch Black, and this is certainly something that I can relate to. Pitch Black was hard science fiction, and also a thriller, where as this film is more Science Fantasy, sort of like Star Wars, and much, much more of an action movie. However, taking it as it is, I did quite like it, despite a number of inconsistencies across the two films (such as the length of time space travel takes - in the first film they were all in cryro-sleep, where as this doesn't seem to be the case here).The film is set on a couple of planets, though the main focus is the planet of Helios Prime, the location of New Mecca. There happens to be this religious cult known as the Necromongers, who travel about the universe pretty must destroying every planet they come across. Riddick, who is in hiding due to the fact that he is a wanted criminal, is forced to return to New Mecca because one of the guys he rescued needs his help against the Necromongers. However, this is where it gets a bit tricky again, because for some strange reason, he decides to head off and find Jack, the woman who had disguised herself a boy.Look, as I mentioned, the film isn't bad, though watching it a week after I watched the first movie did make me realise how far the two films had drifted. Still, there are some good things about it, though I did find that the Necromongers were a bit gaudy in places. However, when you come to accept it for what it is, you can end up running with it.As a cult though, the Necromongers are quite interesting, as they seem to reflect what cults are like in the real world. Namely they pretty much barge through destroying everything in their wake. Well, maybe I should say religion, but we must remember that many of these religions started off as cults, and cults that had some pretty exclusive teachings, which didn't give any room for people who disagreed, or even thought differently. Secondly, we also notice how those who are taken by the Necromongers (and they are rather specific as to who they select), are processed, which sort of flags the concept that cults tend to brainwash their members to a point that they find it very difficult to break out, and even think for themselves, though it certainly is still possible.The other interesting thing is that we have a set of rules, such as 'you take what you kill' (which results in a rather surprising ending, one that did stand out in my mind, particularly the first time I saw it), as well as the political intrigues going on within. That is the thing about cults, while from the outside there seems to be a lot of unity, and loyalty, the reality is that when you delve into the upper echelons, you do being to notice that the unity is almost non-existent.As I said though, this film isn't bad at all. Sure, it isn't a favourite, but I still do feel that it does have rewatch value.",The Chronicles of Riddick

32,Floated2,A Letdown,3,18 January 2014,"The Chronicles of Riddick is the sequel to the 2000 sudden hit Pitch Black. While refusing to simply churn out a rehash of his previous success, writer-director David Twohy has instead taken the lead character of Riddick and placed him in an entirely different type of sci-fi flick. Foregoing the fast-paced thrills of Pitch Black, Twohy has elected to spin a fantasy yarn in the dour Dune/Stargate mold, as the anti-hero (Vin Diesel) finds himself waging a personal war against a race of conquerors known as Necromongers. In Chronicles, we noticed that the film was more made to garner money with it's tamer PG-13 rating and the obvious character changes;Here's one Diesel-fueled vehicle that's neither fast nor furious. The picture improves as it progresses, though not enough to warrant two hours of invested time. Diesel's Riddick is part of the problem: An intriguing character when kept in the shadows for much of Pitch Black, he's become infinitely less interesting as an out-and-out action hero, losing all sense of mystery and reduced to cracking one-liners along with cracking heads. The movie's art direction, costume designs and visual effects all earn top marks. When you make it to the end you might notice how different in feel it is in comparison to Pitch Black.==================================================================== ====== After a rewatch (04/20/17') this film remains a letdown and not too interesting as I have remembered. It feels quite long and is at most times not too entertaining and overly boring. We the audience can tell how mainstream and PG-13 they altered Chronicles of Riddick compared to the original Pitch Black. After another viewing (08/12/17') right after watching Pitch Black, there are some notable changes to Riddick's character, as he isn't as mysterious or wise cracking anymore.

36,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Bigger FX makes Riddick's return more entertaining but a bit too complex,6,4 June 2009,"The predecessor of ""Chronicles of Riddick,"" 2000's ""Pitch Black"" was an exercise in sci- fi/horror, a kill-one-character-at-a-time flick whose saving grace was a gray-eyed anti- hero named Riddick who always did the right thing despite having an attitude about it. Now, this entertaining one-liner machine has stepped into the limelight and into an intergalactic action/adventure ""Star Trek""-esquire genre. ""Riddick"" has more characters, more planets and more special effects. The result is a more exciting and imaginative film, but one that's a bit overwhelming as it juggles a cluttered array of characters, planets and other science-fiction embellishments.The thing keeping ""Riddick"" from being mainstreamed is that it comes on a bit too strong, especially considering ""Pitch Black"" was barely a cult favorite. Let me explain: escaped convict Riddick (Vin Diesel) is tired of being tracked down by bounty hunters so he tries to find out who wants his head. That takes him to Helion Prime, a planet on the verge of an attack by Necromongers, a warring religious cult of sorts going from planet to planet converting more Necromongers and killing anyone who stands in their way. Of course Riddick is too self-serving to care about saving a planet though several characters such as some woman that keeps appearing to him, his old friend Imam and Dame Judi Dench insist that his destiny lies in defeating the Necromongers' evil Lord Marhsal (Colm Feore). And that's just part of it, forget the subplot between Riddick and the girl he cared for in ""Pitch Black"" played by Alex Davalos or the one between Lord Vaako (Karl Urban) and the woman controlling him (Thandie Newton) as they try and take the Necromonger throne.Science-fiction fans will be fascinated by all the concepts and lore to seek their teeth into, but for most viewers it'll be too much. Director and writer David Twohy is a man of great vision but he lacks the foresight to see that his story is too complex -- not in that it's hard to follow, because you get what you need to, but in that it's too hard to care. As far as the costumes, sets and visual effects, Twohy does some great stuff, though strobe-lighting in the earlier action sequences is a bit frustrating.Still, the film's strength, much like that of ""Pitch Black"" lies in its titular character. Vin Diesel's been the star vehicle in several action films, but he's at his best as Riddick. Twohy pens some great one-liners and Diesel delivers them with slick precision. He manages to be both standoffish and caring in this film, not something all A-list action stars can do well without going over-the-top. The development of Riddick's backstory is a little shoddy on Twohy's end -- it'd be better to leave him an enigma than even slightly address it -- but that's part of the complicated web that Twohy weaves in developing this story.Fans of complex sci-fi actioners will really enjoy ""Riddick"" but casual fans of the genre or those who require a stronger human angle will find it a bit much to deem it anything more than entertaining.",The Chronicles of Riddick

Lord Vaako (Karl Urban) and Dame Vaako (Thandie Newton) both swear allegiance to the Lord Marshal, but secretly scheme to take his place. Judi Dench plays Aereon, an 'Elemental.' She like 'The Purifier' (Linus Roache) are rare individuals who are necessary for security but cause concern to the Lord Marshal. If these were not enough to complicate Reddick's life, he must try and stay ahead of the band of Mercs, who vow to collect the high price on his head. The best of the Mercs is an old friend, soldier/warrior and experienced Mercenary named Toombs. (Nick Chinlund). The line of enemies is bad enough, but there's more like a special Universal religion called 'Under-verse' which promises utopia to the converted. Reddic and his friends are targeted for this and if they do not submit, then death. With all the special effects and grand art sets in this film, the movie should make itself very interesting if not down-right memorable. It's a great story, but pay close attention. ****",The Chronicles of Riddick

That was a total laugh and a half! Yep. That was, indeed! OK. Let's face it - In this over-long, CGI-saturated, Sci-Fi klunker it's almost impossible to make any real sense out of all of its futuristic constipation unless, of course, you take into consideration that it was Vin Diesel, himself (that's VD for short), who produced it.And, yes, once you're fully aware of this one, all-important factor, then it instantly clears up a whole pile of nonsensical excrement that has the viewer scratching their head repeatedly while watching this ""been there/seen that"" picture and saying ""WTF!?"" about every 10 minutes.Here in ""Chronicles"" VD, once again, recycles his predictable ""bad-ass"" schtick (ho-hum!), playing (without any real surprises) the Riddick character, a man who (no matter how challenging the situation) is just a little too sure of himself on all levels.With plenty of laughable dialog, tedious personal dramas, asinine plot-line politics, and terrible character interaction, ""Chronicles"" never seemed to fail to get itself more and more bogged down by its stupidity and its incoherency with every passing minute.From its dumb ""Necromonger"" head-gear, to its completely one-dimensional villains, to its corny, clichéd ending, to its unbearably over-long running time - ""Chronicles"" took the ultimate WTF-prize with the sheer preposterousness of Aereon (Judi Dench's character), an utterly useless ""fairy godmother"" figure who blankly looks on and does nothing while Riddick gets his butt royally kicked (again) for about the umpteenth time.And, finally - The following is an actual ""Vin Diesel"" quote that I think ties itself in quite nicely with this and any other VD film. (It also reveals a lot about the apparent sincerity of VD as a real person)""With age, you get to a place where you don't want to knock people out. You just want to give people a big hug."" In my opinion - If VD really means what he's saying in this quote, then why the hell don't any of his movie-roles reflect that ""warm/fuzzy"" viewpoint? To me VD has always come across as being an insensitive brute who's gleefully promoting the exact opposite? P.S.This film's budget was $105 million. On top of his ""producer's fee"", VD was also paid $11 million just to play, pretty much, himself.Ptooey to VD. Ptooey to director David Twohy.

40,dfranzen70,"As good as the first, excellent sfx",7,10 February 2005,"In this follow up to Pitch Black (2000), criminal-on-the-run Riddick (Vin Diesel) finds himself in the middle of a crusade of by the Necromongers, led by the Lord Marshall (Colm Feore), who wishes to convert - or kill - all on the planet of Helion Prime.As we learned in Pitch Black - which was set five years prior to the events in this movie - Riddick can see perfectly in the dark. Which comes in handy on this planet, which is in darkness most of the time. By his side is Kyra (Alexa Davalos), who was named Jack in the first movie, who's been imprisoned deep in the bowels of the planet. Will Riddick be able to bust her out and stop the Necromongers? As Elemental Aereon (Judi Dench) says, sometimes you have to fight evil with a different kind of evil. Enter Master Riddick.The action never lags, and the special effects are magnificent, really much better than I thought they'd be. As with any other action/adventure/sci-fi hodge-podge, the plot might not stand up to close scrutiny, but my interest was surely held over its two-hour running time, which is no mean feat. Diesel may not be John Wayne (yet), but he's got this role down pat already. Dench adds class where class is needed (although she's not on screen enough), and Feore makes a suitable villain. This movie is sort of a low-rent version of the Star Wars movies. It'll entertain, but don't expect it to knock your socks off.",The Chronicles of Riddick
41,dee.reid,"""Chronicling...""",6,26 June 2004,"...What exactly? The adventures of one of cinema's most muscular, bad ass criminals, or the downfall of motion pictures? Well, both actually. I cannot think of a single convincing reason to see this film under any normal circumstances, but I saw ""The Chronicles of Riddick"" under some pretty abnormal circumstances. It seemed tailor-made for the braindead MTV crowd (who seem to get a buzz off these kinds of movies), which I am a part of unfortunately, but what am I going to do?It started with the release of ""Pitch Black - Unrated Director's Cut"" on DVD a few weeks ago, and inside was a free movie ticket to see ""Chronicles.""So as you would guess, I only saw ""Chronicles"" because I know that I'm not passing up a chance to see a movie for free, regardless of whether I'm going to like it or not.I liked David Twohy's ""Pitch Black"" because he presented to us one of the best crafted science fiction films in years and his direction was as sharp as a tack. It was also the last movie that I really liked Vin Diesel in.""Chronicles"" really has nothing to do with the events of the first movie except for the star and one minor character (Keith David) who was also in the first film. This time out, our hero Riddick has a massive bounty on his head, and learns that a fascist-like military regime is intent on wiping out life on certain planets unless they convert to this ""religion"" so they can see the ""Underverse."" Whatever that is, and that's about all there is to the story.I was really not planning to see this film; the news that it was originally rated ""R"" (10 minutes of supposed character development and graphic violence were cut to make it ""PG-13"") was my first warning sign to keep away. But that damn ticket was burning a hole in my wallet and I finally gave into it.On the plus side, there are some nice, if not sloppily edited action scenes and lush visuals that give the planets an eerily-beautiful look. David Twohy proved with ""Pitch Black,"" 2002's ""Below,"" and 1996's ""The Arrival"" that he's a capable filmmaker but his work on this film should be passed over and he should just move on and forget it.6/10",The Chronicles of Riddick
42,injury-65447,You Lost Me at Necromonger,4,26 September 2020,"Some of the visuals are stunning or at least interesting but unfortunately the story is just a big goofy overstuffed space mess. Overall it feels unoriginal and derivative. The acting tends to be overblown and clunky. Why is Judi Dench in this as a wind lady? The whole thing is just ridiculous.I didn't feel that the relationship between Riddick & Jack was developed enough to have these emotional moments feel earned at all. The character work in general is lacking. So is the world building. Despite some initial exposition we are still pretty much clueless about the politics, factions, religions and motivations of this universe and its inhabitants. Too many ideas were being crammed into a two hour movie.I wanted to like it more but I have to give an honest opinion. Pitch Black was a better film.",The Chronicles of Riddick
43,Chris_Docker,When will the 'science' come back into science fiction??,7,7 September 2004,"THE CHRONICLES OF RIDDICK lacks the suspense of its Pitch Black forerunner, but is so beautifully composed that it will satisfy many die-hard sci-fi fantasists. The worldscapes are ingeniously and meticulously devised, the characters and mythologies worthy of an epic, and the battles and monsters are just enough different from those that they are derived from to keep us interested. There is little connection to its forerunner except for the main character, Riddick, a Furian whose will to never submit (and perhaps his criminal-turned-hero background personality) is the major force against the creatures of the Underverse. After avoiding mercenaries intent on capturing him, he finds himself on the planet Helion - which is being invaded by the Necromongers. Necromongers are humans that have been 'subjugated' and no longer feel pain - they are half of this world and half of the 'next world' (some nice Borg analogies here . . .) They have this kinda cool way of moving - a sort of super-fast plus slow-mo trail that's like a darker version of the Matrix's Agent Smith (plus they look kinda nasty). Vin Diesel has plenty of super-energy of his own, an indomitable will, and those special eyes he got from the last movie that let him see in the dark. Judi Dench is neutral as an 'Elemental' that just conveys info and is pretty well immune to getting blown away. Riddick has a lovely side-kick at some points called Kyra (played by French brunette beauty Alexa Davalos) who is also reasonably good at kickin' ass. OK, the fighting gets a bit repetitive after a bit, but it's reasonably quality stuff. Nothing as sophisticated as the Matrix (realms like 'Crematoria' lack a certain subtlety) but as an action flick it's really not bad. But when will we see this dire trend of sci-fi fantasy, where the plot lines are based on various races' (and the audiences) need for superstition, reversed? When will the 'science' come back into science fiction??",The Chronicles of Riddick
44,Fluke_Skywalker,Ambitious to a fault,6,27 April 2017,"Plot; Fugitive Richard B. Riddick inadvertently becomes wrapped up in the galaxy-wide struggle against an army of zealots.If Pitch Black was inspired by films like Alien, Frank Herbert's Dune series seems to be the muse for Chronicles of Riddick. If that seems like a hard right turn, it is, but the latter still feels as if it's taking place in the same universe created in the former. Though the story at large is about prophecies and destiny and grand, sweeping struggles, the sinew of the movie remains the grimy underbelly of the galaxy where the monsters who hide in the shadows aren't half as dangerous as the ones who hide in the light.Chronicles is an ambitious movie. Too ambitious for its own good truth be told. Its attempts at world building are often ham-fisted and head scratching. I can tell a lot of thought went into creating the galactic politics on display here, but their explanation often feels like when my 8 year old nephew tries to tell me about his field trip to the zoo ""And then we saw the giraffes who were, because there were these monkeys making a lot of noise, but then when we got to feed the elephants..."". The story holds together on the margins, but the finer points often fray like an old cloth. The ambition doesn't stop at the storytelling. Director David Twohy attempts to create epic scale, but is too often betrayed by f/x that were shoddy even by the standards of the day.The cast is uniformly strong. It would be wrong to dismiss the character of Riddick as a monosyllabic quip machine. Oh there is that, but Diesel adds a layer of humanity hidden beneath the folds of Riddick's sweaty muscle-tees. Also strong are Thandie Newton as the deliciously manipulative Dame Vaako, playing puppet master to get her husband (played by Karl Urban) on the throne, Colm Feore, suitably theatrical as the Lord Marshall, and Nick Chindlund as the sleazy mercenary Toombs. Heck, even Dame Judi Dench shows up and scores points for not looking embarrassed (though I suppose I was embarrassed enough for her to make up for it).Despite its weaknesses, Chronicles is actually pretty good in fits and starts, but the larger story gets put on ice in the second act while Riddick and Co. play prison break. It's solidly done, but it goes on for far, far too long and all of the drama comes screeching to a halt to accommodate it and never recovers.",The Chronicles of Riddick
45,NateWatchesCoolMovies,Awesome sci fi flick,8,28 May 2016,"David Twohy's Pitch Black was a dank, murky horror sci fi that took place inside a claustrophobic killing jar, all the action unfolding on one planet, and over a short amount of time. With The Chronicles Of Riddick, he lifts the lid off that jar, unveiling more planets, characters, creatures and broadening both the scope of what is seen visually and what takes place in the story. What began as a simple human vs. monster survival tale crystallizes into a full blown operatic space saga, and I loved every minute of it. Now there are a lot of people who hate it, and fine for them if they want to live inside such negativity. I was sold after the intro, in which a snarky, canine - like bounty hunter (Nick Chinlund) chases a haggard looking Riddick a across the bizarre, jagged face of a planet that would make the asteroid from Armageddon sweat. This film takes place sometime after Pitch Black, the few survivors scattered across the galaxy. There's a price on Riddick's head, which Toombs (Chinlund) intends to collect. Riddick unwittingly wanders into the path of something far more dangerous in his evasive efforts: a powerful, fascist master race known as the Necromongers are cutting a swath through the known universe, converting or killing anyone they find. They are led by the """" (Colm Feore), and commanded by Lord Vaako (another badass character for Karl Urban to another do to his rogue's gallery), a nasty piece of work who is further soured by his insidious wife (Thandie Newton). Riddick has encounter with them, as well as an old friend from former times (an all too brief Keith David) and is taken far and away, to a dangerous prison on a planet called Crematoria, where the wrecking ball of a sun fries everything on the surface every half hour or so. It all happens fast (and furious hehe), in a somewhat rushed frenzy of sci fi action, cool effects and surprisingly vicious antics for a PG-13 flick. Diesel was born to play Riddick, a growling night wolf of an antihero and endlessly watchable. There's all sorts of half Cooke ideas running around, some fun and others left unexplored. There's a prophecy involving the Purifier (Linus Roache) who has ties to Riddick's tragic past and the fate of his race, a strange elemental (Judi Dench looking confused), another person from his past (Alexa Davalos) and other intrigue involving Urban. Best to sit back and let it wash over you like the fun it is. Chinlund is hilarious as Toombs, the only character who seems to have wandered in from inner city L.A., a wide ass prick with a hate streak for Riddick and that old school charisma that carries scenes. The set pieces are exhilarating and make up for the plot which is at times spread too thinly, but never hurts the film. I love it, watch it all the time, let the haters sulk... more for us.",The Chronicles of Riddick
46,dworldeater,Entertaining,7,17 April 2020,"The Chronicles Of Riddick is an action oriented sequel to the more Alien/horror influenced Pitch Black. Riddick is hunted by mercenaries and must save the universe from Necromongers. To say that this movie is ridiculous is an understatement, but in its own way it works. This is by no means a great film, it is a step above something that would by made by the Syfi Channel. Vin Diesel won't win any acting awards, but he is right for and nails the brooding antihero superhero Riddick. The acting is about what you would expect for a B sci fi actioner, but it does have Keith David returning briefly and Karl Urban is amusing as an armored and mulleted villain. The special f/x are really bad and dated early CGI. Overall this movie is really campy and over the top fantasy science fiction. The Chronicles Of Riddick is very action packed and Vin Diesel has a strange chrasisma as Riddick that somehow works. This series of films may not be for everyone, but everyone I know that is really into science fiction loves the franchise and this installment is by far the most action packed. Overall, this may not be the best movie and it definitely is a bit cheesy, but it is imaginitive and creative enough to deserve some merit and it works as some fast paced over the top entertainment with a tsunami of butt kicking.",The Chronicles of Riddick
47,Enchorde,Nice action with average plot,7,17 January 2005,"** HERE MIGHT BE SPOILERS **Recap: Riddick (Diesel) is a hunted man. He constantly has mercs on his track and he heads to Helion Prime to find the one who posted the bounty. It turns out to be his old friend the Imam (David). Helion Prime is facing the threat of the Necromongers, an almost invincible cult with it's own armada and army. To conquered people the Necromongers give the choice: convert or fight. To fight means certain death. However the Imam and a the Elementar Aeron (Dench) thinks Riddick is the man that can defeat the Mecromongers. But Riddick has his own plans. ""Jack"" is missing, imprisoned on the hellish planet Crematoria. So he must go there to rescue her, but now the Necromongers are on his trail. The Lord Marshal's (Feore) most trusted captain Vaako (Urban) is sent for him and complicates matter.My Thoughts: A very entertaining movie, with a different style than the previous movie. This is more focused on action and choreographed fights, and the very aggressive Riddick. However, it is done well so I see no fault there. The plot is average, mostly about putting Riddick in dangerous positions that he has to fight himself out of. But it is good enough. Some new interesting characters, especially Dench's Aeron, adds to the positive side as well. Diesel is also very good as Riddick himself. Nice design of costumes and scenery, most (or all) I guess is computer made, with nice special effects. Overall an entertaining movie.7/10",The Chronicles of Riddick
48,questl-18592,The Chronicles of Vinny,5,27 October 2020,"I couldn't help but find this a bit of an odd sequel for Pitch Black. It's such a tonal shift from the dark, atmospheric world of Pitch Black to this attempted space epic. That's where it falls apart for me too. Pitch Black was a small, contained movie with a fascinating concept and solid delivery. The character of Riddick was an oddly charismatic Bogeyman that stole the movie but I doubt that he dominated in terms of screen time. Enter The Chronicles and clearly the execs saw dollar signs and did the same thing they often do, rush to try and milk that cash cow of all it's worth.Where Pitch Black was dark and controlled, CoR is a glutton of exposition, universe building, character establishment and... Just so much crammed into one movie. Some of it is interesting but because there's so much we never really get to live in things enough or explore things the way they should be. The primary antagonist is some sort of religious sect with an undead space vampire as the leader? We never really get a ton about their whole thing despite the seemingly constant stream of exposition. We know that there are elementals though, and an underverse, and weird armor plated dogs and a prison built on a planet like Mercury that's half on fire depending on what part faces the sun. Oh and there's the history of Riddick's people, a prophecy about a chosen one, a MacBethian coup in the works and a holy man trying to instill a sense of religion into things. Oh! And Riddick has a daughter-figure in this too.See? Glut. It's just too much. And yet, I enjoy Diesel in this role and Urban is always enjoyable and Feore has had a soft spot with me since Storm of the Century. This is a background movie. It's so overstuffed with nonsense that there's no point really paying attention to it all but there's a good chance every time you look up there will be a new thing to see and that makes for good background watching.",The Chronicles of Riddick
49,rbverhoef,Flawed entertainment,6,5 October 2005,"'The Chronicles of Riddick' is the sequel to 'Pitch Black' although it has very little in common with that first film. Riddick is once again played by Vin Diesel and we meet some other characters from the first film, but even they seem to think they are in something else than a 'Pitch Black'-sequel, most notably Kyra (Alexa Davalos) who was named Jack in the first film since they thought she was a boy. Now it is five years later and she has turned into one fine looking lady.The story deals with Necromongers, people who have a certain religion where one of the commandments apparently is that you keep what you kill. They want to convert every single soul; believers will go to some kind of heaven named the Underverse. Conveniently Riddick happens to be a Furian, a race that could destroy the Necromongers. The leader of the Necromongers by the way is Lord Marshal (Colm Feore), someone who is half alive and half... something else. To sum up: don't watch this film for its fantastic story.But if you like science fiction and action I have to admit there is a good chance you will enjoy this film. It is not as good as 'Pitch Black', but the movie knows that and tries to make up for that with the special effects, art direction, costumes. I some ways it works. Like 'The Matrix Reloaded' it is filled with action and when that happens you easily forget how bad a story actually is. Diesel is the right actor in a film like this and most of the time I liked him here.Some things bothered me a little. Why Judi Dench is in this movie, both the actress as the character, I do not know. It is one from a couple of things the movie contains without really having a purpose for it. Well, she predicts something somewhere. Another one is a little girl that is very much in the movie at the beginning but it seems she is very much forgotten near the end. Why introduce characters you never use? Still, the movie works where it wants to do that. If nothing else, 'The Chronicles of Riddick' is an entertaining shell of a movie.",The Chronicles of Riddick
50,Samiam3,Pointless and Pathetic,3,4 August 2010,"The only thing about The Chronicles of Riddick that writer/director David Thowy does right is his intention to improve on that with Pitch Black was missing, mostly adrenaline. But such a decision does not always guarantee satisfactory results. And this motion picture proves to be far from satisfactory.The sheer clumsiness of The Chronicles of Riddick is unacceptable and unfair to anyone who had a moments trust in the film. Pitch Black was quite imperfect, but I liked it. I was hoping this one would give the character of Riddick a bit of a chance to grow. The story gives Riddick plenty of space to run around in, but the character remains the same, and goes nowhere. If anything he has gotten worse.The acting is pathetic. That and the atrocious dialogue make the Chronicles of Riddick often annoying to listen to. With the exception of Thandi Newton's costumes and maybe two or three digitally enhanced landscape shots, this is not a very nice picture to look at either. The problem isn't so much a matter of being ugly, but rather fake looking. The aesthetic design of Pitch Black, has been swapped for copious amounts of mediocre CGI.The plot is confusing. It recalls Dune, because there are so many places and faces to remember, and likewise, there is no sense of adventure, even with all the interplanetary travel. The fights scenes don't do a very good job of breaking the tedium, because they are also pretty dull to watch.The finished project is a big disappointment. It collapses under the weight of its own sloppiness, and amounts to nothing.",The Chronicles of Riddick
51,davidmvining,Can we get a Script Doctor over here?!,5,10 May 2021,"So, Pitch Black came and went in theaters to a very mild reaction, but it blew up on DVD enough so that Universal decided to get David Twohy over a hundred million dollars to make a follow up to his $23 million budgeted thriller. Faced with the kind of money that went to making an individual entry in The Lord of the Rings film, he and Vin Diesel had little idea of how to use that kind of money. They came up with a trilogy of movies, smartly moving beyond the small film idea of the first, but they had no idea to actually build the first of this trilogy. I think a good script doctor could have rearranged the major elements of the screenplay to create a single, cohesive experience, but as the final film stands today, this is two stories squished very uncomfortably against each other.I usually don't start with a comment on cinematography, but The Chronicles of Riddick may be the worst looking big budget film I've seen. They built huge sets, and they wanted to make sure that audiences saw every detail, lighting the large spaces in such a way that it all looks incredibly flat. It often feels like the sort of lighting you get on television movies, knowing that the film is going to be seen on the small screen exclusively so they need to get as much detail as possible onto the film. That never looks good on television productions, but it looks terrible on a big budget action spectacle. The sets are nice, but they're filmed in an inherently uncinematic way that it just looks flat.Anyway, Riddick is still on the run five years after the events of Pitch Black, and a new bounty on his head (alive) brings him to the planet Helion Prime. He wants to know who put the bounty on his head and how he can get it off. The imam he saved from the planet was the only one who knew where he was going, and the imam told the Elemental (Judi Dench, filtering in and out of view with any breeze in a neat idea with no explanation or exploration) who put the price on him. She knows of a threat to the planet, in fact the entire universe, manifested in the Necromongers, a race of warriors on a crusade for the Underverse, converting or killing everyone in their way. They consume worlds and move on, and Helion Prime is next. The Elemental asserts that the only way to fight this evil is with another form of evil, Riddick.Here's one major issue with this movie: Riddick isn't interesting. What helped the first film in a limited way was that Fry was going through something interesting, but Riddick is just this sort of bad ass character with no real weaknesses or desires. There's another issue where Riddick is supposed to be a type of evil, but Diesel and Twohy want him to be a good guy, the anti-hero. It could have been addressed with a more clear cut narrative with a sense of proper structure, but any growth within the character over the course of the film ends up feeling random.Anyway, the Necromongers attack, wiping out an entire planet's defenses in a single night, and begin the process of converting or killing everyone left. In an unclear series of events, Riddick ends up at a large meeting between civic leaders (I guess) and the Lord Marshall of the Necromongers. Riddick is there because the big, hulking soldier that killed the imam is there (though Riddick literally just appears in the scene without ever walking in, I think something got cut here), and he wants to kill him for revenge. Easily dispatching one of the Lord Marshall's best soldiers, Riddick is introduced to the Necromonger code (""You keep what you kill"") and taken into their main ship where his mind is probed by the quasi-dead.I want to take a moment to talk about the Necromonger design. Aside from the fact that everything is filmed really flatly, I kind of love the look of the Necromongers. The main capital ships are spears that fall to the planet. The small fighter ships evoke the blind creatures from Pitch Black, allowing for a nice repeat of Riddick's point of view shot of the flying antagonists that are about to attack. The actual aesthetic is heavy on mummified corpses and skulls. This stuff looks cool. I just wish it had been filmed cinematically.In a series of unbelievable events, Riddick escapes and gets immediately captured by the mercs who had been chasing him at the beginning of the film, and he's off to Crematoria, or the second movie within this movie. A think an intelligent script doctor would have moved Crematoria from the second act to the first, introducing the adult version of Jack, the girl disguised as a boy in Pitch Black now a murderous convict like Riddick, early and even telling the story from her point of view. Kyra, as she's known now, feels that Riddick lied to her about the life. This gets a massive short shrift in the film, undeveloped and just laying around, but this is the makings of a main character in embryonic form. Forced to reface the idol of her youth and confront the reality of the life she led in his stead, she has to make choices about her future. None of that gets explored, of course. She's introduced too late and Riddick is too much of the focus for Kyra to get the kind of attention she needs.And this Crematoria sequence represents the massive frustration of the movie in microcosm. There's really cool stuff here. The planet might make zero sense whatsoever (700 degrees in daylight, 300 below at night, and the people can run around the surface without suits fine at night, whatever), but the prison itself is a neat idea. The escape to the runway kilometers away in a race over the surface against the prison guards under the ground is fun and propulsive. It makes no sense, but it's energetically told and fun with a propulsive soundtrack that helps it all flow. It's just kind of stupid and has almost nothing to do with the overall movie's story which, you may remember, involves a race of Necromongers who are crusading across the galaxy. Crematoria doesn't fit in the second act of this story. It would fit in the first act as a way to get us into the story. An escape from a closed part of the galaxy to discover that the larger galaxy is dealing with a larger threat. Seriously, this movie needed a script doctor.The movie's finale ends up falling flat because it relies entirely on Riddick's emotional attachment to Kyra, which was introduced late and never developed in any meaningful sense (seriously, introduce all of this in the first act, gosh darn it). The ending does end up pretty cool with a neat action scene as Riddick faces off against the Lord Marshall's weird powerset and Riddick suddenly ends up where he never expected. This is a great ending to a movie that doesn't deserve it, potentially opening up Riddick's tale to bigger things, but as you probably know this movie was not the box office success everyone wanted. Those bigger adventures were never to come to pass.This is one of those frustrating movies where all of the major problems are not only at the script level, but they're so obviously at the script level and so obvious that they should have been addressed before a single pre-production sketch ever got commissioned. Universal, excited at the idea of a new franchise to make money on, really needed to get David Twohy in a room with a script doctor to review the basic structure of the film. Without that, this movie is out of order and pretty much incoherent from every major narrative element you can imagine. There's stuff to enjoy here and there, sometimes extending to entire sequences, but it just cannot come together into a single film. This revealed that there was potential in a franchise around the character of Richard B. Riddick, but also that it was in the wrong hands to realize it.",The Chronicles of Riddick
52,onepotato2,Dune meets Stargate meets King Herod meets Macbeth meets Excalibur,5,9 March 2005,"It's popular to argue that Pitch Black was the better of these 2 movies, and that this is just an overblown mess. I found Pitch Black to be a spfx heavy, sci-fi actioner of little merit. Riddick is certainly overblown but it does have striking visuals. This opulent monarchic future has previously been depicted in Stargate and Dune. It's hard to take a dark lord seriously when he's wearing a silly Janus mask and some bargain outfits he picked up at Cher's garage sale.But you have to admit it took a lot of effort and imagination to deliver this bad movie. The early scenes of planet-killing are pretty persuasive, and some effects are novel (a ghost army, an armada of fighter ships linked like a motorcycle chain). Other whole sequences could be mercifully eliminated (the predator dogs in the prison). There are other signs of biting off more than they could chew (Riddicks ""bare eyeballs"" point-of-view shots are abandoned as this drags on). Other tiresome tropes: - Bad conservatives against the open-minded (& chronically unarmed) liberals. - When in doubt model your villains on the Nazis - Thandie Newton stars as Lady MacBeth. - The Wizard of Oz and Excalibur are pilfered for ideas.Some of the green screen fx here are absurd (The yellow cliffs on Crematoria).

Riddick. While the character itself doesn't have as many films as Diesel's other tent pole franchise, Pitch Black (2000) was quite the unique film. Not only did it have a sense of mystery surrounding its main cast, but also pit them against a very hard deadline of escaping a dangerous planet. Following up to that initial success is this sequel, which almost turns in a full 180. Unfortunately, the showing here is less than stellar for how the story was executed this time. That's sad since some people were also from the original film.Solely writing and directing this feature was David Twohy, the same director of Pitch Black (2000). Knowing this, it seems additional writers Ken and Jim Wheat were needed again as they helped co-write Pitch Black (2000). The title itself doesn't really make sense either. The ""chronicles""? What chronicles? This film is just one long overly drawn out story, with little to no record of what Riddick has been up to. Taking place five years after Pitch Black (2000), Riddick finds himself reuniting with Imam (Keith David) to find his home planet being invaded by a race known as the Necromongers. Simultaneously, he learns that Jack now called Kyra (Alexa Davalos), who he saved with Imam in Pitch Black (2000), is being held in a prison on another planet.If viewers thought the convenience of landing on planet exactly when it was going to eclipse in Pitch Black (2000) was too contrived, then this will be far worse. It just so happens the subplot related to Kyra crosses paths with the Necromonger plot thread. What are the odds? On top of that, there's even more subplots going on about Riddick being the so-called ""chosen one"" who will overthrow the Necromongers told by an elemental played by Judi Dench. There's also two characters among the Necromongers, Vaako (Karl Urban) and Dame Vaako (Thandie Newton) who plan to commit treason on their leader Lord Marshal (Colm Feore). Why all the different storylines? Was it truly needed for this?What made Pitch Black (2000) so entertaining was its single story line. Nothing involving ""the chosen one"" tropes or political treason among ranks. If there's one thing Twohy did get right, it was keeping the continuity to the first film. That was done well. Seeing Keith David return and on his home planet was cool. There was even an explanation as to why Jack had a name change. That's all good! It just all the added plot threads that weigh down the pacing and entertainment value to the main story of focus. It's fine if the idea was to expand Riddick's universe and lore, but it's too much too soon. That doesn't mean the actors aren't credible though. Even Nick Chinlund has an appearance as a snarky mercenary.From a visual standpoint, it's half and half. The action sequences are fun to watch. Vin Diesel has proven himself to be an action star as well as Alexa Davalos, Karl Urban and Colm Feore. Sadly, it's the camerawork handled by Hugh Johnson that doesn't come off very appealing. Much of the time, Johnson relies on a lot of Dutch angles and shaky cam, which gets very annoying when trying to watch. Music again, is also another component that could have been better. With composer Graeme Revell returning for round two, one would think he'd make up for his rather dull score from the last film. No luck, Revell continues to make his music as bland and anonymous as possible. A real let down.Sequels tend to not perform as well as their predecessor, but they don't tend to fall too hard. This one did just that though. While the action, acting and continuity is kept in-tact, which is shocking compared to most sequels. The plot is overly complicated with poor cinematography and uninspired music.",The Chronicles of Riddick
54,lemon_magic,"A bit too much of a Vin Diesel ""pose fest"", but has considerable merit as an Sci Fi action flick",7,28 August 2005,"I was looking forward to this movie before it came out, as much for the presence of the director (David Twohy) as its big name actor (Vin Diesel, returning as ""Riddick""). I liked the setting - a future universe with humanity scattered across a thousand worlds, each world only loosely associated or connected with the others. In such a future, there seems to be no ""Federation"" or ""Republic"" to help the worlds of humanity act as a united front. So when a fascist threat such as the Necromongers arises and begin conquering planet after planet, the remaining worlds can only listen for rumors of distant disaster and genocide and wait for their turn to fall, one by one.Twohy's future universe is a much colder and meaner place than the beloved worlds of 'Star Wars' or ""Star Trek'. Money and commerce rule over all, mercenaries and prison planets are a vital part of the social fabric of human society, and if one nation or world disappears, dies, or is destroyed, there is no one to protest or avenge it.In such a world, a character such as Riddick makes sense. TCOR is an all out attempt to create an immersive future universe, with enormous amounts of money and effort set on background CGI, set design, costume design, props and weapons. Seriously, I haven't seen that much money on the screen this side of George Lucas. The results may not be to everyone's taste - it's as if the cover artists for the magazine ""Metal Hurlant"" wanted H.R. Giger's baby and sublimated it with an obsession for Roman and Spartan battle masks and leather and spikes. I liked the designs and the careful depiction of future tech (field distortion effects for weapons and thrusters, cold sleep hibernation,ion trails, humans turned into cybernetic blood hounds, etc) but even I found it oppressive and irritating at some points. Other viewers might hate it outright. The screenplay is a hyperkinetic mess, but is also a meth addict's dream come true - the story bounces back and forth, all over the universe, and features much brutality and gruesome macho horse manure. Some of it just doesn't make much sense (for instance, when Riddick has the pursuing merc boss at his mercy, why doesn't he just kill him, instead of letting him live to pursue him again? After all, Riddick just killed everyone else on the merc crew!) Young men of a certain age will probably find it irresistible, but it doesn't have a lot of heart to it. As for Diesel's worth as an actor? Well, he is what he is. I like him, some people can't stand him, others think he's good but not nearly as good as he pretends. I believe if you go into this with an open mind (not thinking about the critical backlash from ""XXX"" or ""Fast and the Furious"") and give him (and the character) a chance, you'll probably enjoy his performance here. He's a lug, and he spends a little too much time posing and showing off his deltoids, but he can carry it off. Hell, if I had arms like that, I'd cut the sleeves off my sports coats to show them off, so I can't really blame him too much. The supporting cast is strong. Colm Feore is always a pleasure to watch, even when he's chewing the scenery. David Keith is in the first 1/3 of the movie in the OTHER returning role from ""Pitch Black"" (I don't count ""Kyra"", because she's played by a different,older actress), and he is his usual splendid self as well. Can't recommend this movie unreservedly - you may hate the way this future universe looks, and you may hate Diesel as a furry voiced misanthrope. But there is plenty here to like, especially if you like visions of the future by creators like Jack Vance, Alfred Bester or Cordwainer Smith, rather than Isaac Asimov or Theodore Sturgeon.",The Chronicles of Riddick
55,Rob_Taylor,Not half bad,8,30 July 2004,"Chronicles is not a bad film, by any means. The story and various elements in it need a little more explaining - like who the Elementals are, the origins of the Furion race, the nature of the Underverse etc. - but no doubt (I hope) these things will be explained further in any sequels.I admit to being a little disappointed by the same-old, same-old nature of sci-fi movies these days. Either you get the shiny-shiny plastic Star Trek and Star Wars worlds, or the dirty, grubby Alien worlds. The only other ""look"" to sci-fi that I can think of is the Dune look, which Chronicles has adopted to a certain extent here. You get a certain amount of the gothic-look together with a grubby reality that seems to work quite well. At least it was interesting to look at.Someone commented that there weren't any surprises as you knew Riddick would survive. Whilst that is true, simply knowing the story does not make it uninteresting. Or, to put it another way, knowing where you are going doesn't lessen the enjoyment of the journey.And Chronicles is a journey. Admittedly, it's a pretty basic one that sees Riddick (Diesel) beating his way through various opponents and worlds until the inevitable climactic showdown. But it's still enjoyable nonetheless.For those hoping for another Pitch Black there will be great disappointment. For those interested in seeing where Riddick went from there, this film is quite entertaining. For those who don't know who Riddick is, I recommend seeing the first movie beforehand. It has a lot more character development and background than Chronicles does. Not that we don't learn more about Riddick in this film, just not as much compared to Pitch Black.As an actor, Diesel is hardly tested by the character of Riddick. In fact he's not really been stretched by anything he's done. It might be nice to see what he could do with a non-action part, though I think he needs to get that one, defining movie under his belt first. I don't think Chronicles is that film, but it won't do him any harm. It's certainly better than XXX, anyway.A surprise in this film was the presence of Judi Dench. No doubt cast to lend a certain gravitas to the Elemental being she plays, she does that admirably. Apparently Diesel asked her to be in the movie himself.Also here is Karl Urban, of LOTR fame. His role isn't very well developed, but he pulls it off nonetheless. Again, not a movie that will hurt his career.All in all this movie is reasonable entertainment that leaves you with unanswered questions about Riddick and his universe. Hopefully the film will be successful enough that a follow-up will be made to address these questions.Well worth a look in.",The Chronicles of Riddick
56,winner55,Conan fights Star Wars,4,10 July 2006,"Some fans of Pitch Black have expressed disappointment with this follow-up film. Although the character of Riddick remains the same from film to film, the universe he inhabits alters radically in this new adventure. The universe of Pitch Black is pretty much the same the audience inhabits. Physical laws, like gravity and the laws of force, obtain in Pitch Black pretty much the way they do here on the planet earth.The universe of Chronicles is actually a multi-dimensional reconstruction of the old maps of ""Hyperboria"" that used to accompany the publication of the old stories by Robert E. Howard about a barbarian mercenary named Conan. And as in the Conan stories, science can only accomplish so much, and then one must resort to magic. And, as in the Conan stories, ethnicity determines character - Judy Dench, pressed for a one-word descriptor of her species, responds: ""We calculate"". - Huh? Is that in their genes? So of course, Riddick has to save the universe, not because he's really sharp and pretty strong and agile, but because he's the last of the ""Furion"", the species wiped out by the bad-guy's army.Finally, just like in the Conan stories, the universe of this second Riddick film looks strangely like a Roman Empire as designed by the architects of Medieval cathedrals.So perhaps it should came as no surprise that the film ends on pretty much the same note as does the Arnold Schwarzenegger film ""Conan the Barbarian"" of some 20 years earlier. I suppose if you have some adolescent's wet-dream of power hanging around, one ought to try to sell it; it's the audience that has the problem, after all.That said, I admit I had some fun in this movie. The action sequences are very well done, and Vin Diesel remains believable in this role. I'm just getting bored with the Conan myth, and bored, too, with the other obvious influence on this film, the Star Wars myth. The universe doesn't look anything like either of these myths, and it never will; strong-willed individuals don't hack their way to power, politicians network and make deals. Ethnicity is a question of melanin and education, we are not born with personalities imprinted in our genes.I really like the action scenes in this film, so I'll just have to fast-forward a lot to avoid the sociopathic dialog. You should, too.",The Chronicles of Riddick
57,screenman,Chalk & Cheese From Mr Twohy,5,2 December 2010,"'Pitch Black' was a stand-out science fiction horror movie. The plot was hardly novel, but it brought some refreshingly original turns to the formula. Not least of them was a group of characters, each of which had a clearly defined personality. Each had strengths and weaknesses - unusually nowadays - mostly weaknesses, which lent themselves to our sympathy. Every one of them was vulnerably likable from the vain antiques dealer to the ruthless brute Riddick.And it was Riddick - played with supreme cool by Vin Diesel - who was the mainstay character. The movie was a success, but hardly the box-office smash of 'Aliens'.David Twohy, its creator, saw fit to develop the franchise with a sequel. 'The Chronicles Of Riddick' was the result.I loved 'Pitch Black' and would like to say something good about 'The Chronicles'. The trouble is: I can't think of anything. To me, it was a gloomy, monochrome, special-effects and CGI borathon. All of the characters appeared not only to dress alike, but to be alike. Each was just a clone of the other: vicious, violent, untrustworthy and so tiresomely macho. It required little effort to see the whole thing as an out-of-control computer game. The production had an artificial 'feel' like that of 'beowulf'. Many of the action sequences were so 'busy' as to be almost dizzying rather than entertaining.Riddick himself morphed from the violently flawed but ultimately redeemed human into the sort of wall-walking super-hero of the 'Matrix' franchise.'Pitch Black' is in my collection; this twaddle couldn't even retain my interest for a single viewing.Not recommended.",The Chronicles of Riddick
58,denis888,Excellent sequel to the Pitch Black,9,10 August 2007,"Vin Diesel is even better in The Chronicles of Riddick, a very decent sequel to the Pitch Black movie, made by Mr. Twohy, who proves again that the space theme is not beaten or banal at all. Here we meet excellent plot with horrible merciless nation of space invaders, with Karl Urban as one of them, and again here is Riddick who opposes this terrible menace and he manages at a great cost, but still he does. What makes this movie really good is a brilliant work of camera men, the smashing sceneries and excellent actors' work. Very good film, very deep and it leaves us at the moment when we all really wish that the third part be done as well.",The Chronicles of Riddick

60,sarastro7,"Oww, what a disappointment",5,13 August 2004,"Based on a nearly euphoric re-discovery of Pitch Black, my expectations for Chronicles of Riddick were through the roof. I expected grandiose space opera, epic adventure, amazing action, superb world-building. What I got was a practically plotless synopsis presentation of a computer game, with the most unnuanced and uncharismatic bad guys in the history of cinema. No story, no science, no excitement and certainly no emotional engagement. There were bits here that could have worked well if supported by the rest of the material, but overall it was the worst kind of uninspired hot air. The story was built around the character to the point where the story didn't matter, and if the story is boring, what good is a cool character? And the androgynous Jack from the first movie suddenly looked like a supermodel.What a crying shame to have totally wasted something that showed so much promise.3 out of 10.",The Chronicles of Riddick
61,mentalcritic,Better than it gets credit for...,8,16 December 2004,"I went into The Chronicles Of Riddick expecting a thoughtless, charmless snooze-fest. What I got instead was an entertaining mix of science fiction and action that, while not as cerebral or creative as its predecessor, certainly had more going for it than a lot of the competition at the time. In essence, this is a two-hour Buck Rogers with what would probably amount to a hundred times the budget. It works simply because it gives the audience a taste of the mayhem it wants.Where Pitch Black gave us a very small window into a deeply dysfunctional universe, The Chronicles Of Riddick shows us the workings of a galactic society that has more in common with Feudal Europe than the Utopian Star Trek model. The bigger budget is reflected in the more complex set and prop designs. The location, on the other hand, has been moved from the desolation of Coober Pedy, Australia, to a more adaptable Vancouver, Canada. What they cannot simulate in the Canadian locations has obviously been added in with the kind of CG work that was kept to a minimum on Pitch Black.This both works for and against the film. Whereas Pitch Black took its time to set up a credible mood and atmosphere, COR instead prefers to set an Indiana Jones-like pace in order to keep its audience from considering the improbability factor. Characters like Riddick and Kyra, the sidekick, are fleshed out somewhat and given a decent back-story. Everyone else, save for Aereon, is basically there to give Riddick something to kill or fight alongside. Aereon is played with a typically grandiose, bold air by Judi Dench, whom Diesel apparently begged or enticed into playing the part. His efforts were well-spent, as she brings a touch of class into what could have been some very ho-hum exposition sequences.Karl Urban also gets a turn as one of the major villains, a Necromonger called Vaako. Although I have yet to see him turn in a performance that involves more than looking powerful at the right moments, he does lend credibility to the character in a way that I doubt many other actors of his age working in the current Hollywood system could achieve. Alexa Davalos also puts in a great performance as Kyra, an extension of the confused little girl we knew as Jack in Pitch Black. Her performance, though not terribly stand-out, shows that she has a great deal of potential.If there is one sequence in the film that seems a bit ill-advised, it is the escape from the prison planet. The rapid-cycling sun suggests a day with a length of about three minutes, which would introduce all sorts of environmental instabilities. I don't merely mean the kind with the sun's rays burning everything in sight. I also have to ponder how close to a star a planet would have to be in order to produce such devastating effects.I gave The Chronicles Of Riddick an eight out of ten. It is certainly more enjoyable than some of the other big sequels that came out in this year, but I would not call it a keeper. Not unless you are such a fan of Diesel that you simply have to own everything that he has ever made.",The Chronicles of Riddick
62,reddiemurf81,Good sci fi action,6,18 May 2020,"My rating is based on the trilogy (this, along with Pitch Black, and Riddick)I'd give the trilogy a 6.5 (were that an option). Diesel is his usual action self. Lots of good sci-fi elements,,, what more do ya need to know.So go watch it!
So",The Chronicles of Riddick
63,phubbs,The Chronicles of Riddick,6,11 September 2013,"So 'Pitch Black' was a sleeper hit which meant it was inevitable that a sequel would come along, unfortunately Hollywood never learns and they messed it up as per usual. The return of 'Riddick' is a strange convoluted mess that mixes various other film elements and completely loses what the franchise was originally. But does that make it a bad film?Now I just saw the director's cut and it does clear things up (apparently) over the cinematic version. I honestly can't comment on this as I haven't seen the cinematic version since it came out in the cinema way back in 2004. Bottom line apart from extra fight bits and various other odd small scenes the main crux of the director's cut are a few flashback sequences where Riddick sees a spirit-like entity of one of his people. This female gives him more information about his past and home world.The whole plot in general is choppy, we get to grips with these 'Necromongers' coming along and threatening every living soul including Riddick. So you think you're gonna get a full on war between the naughty legions and Riddick. But no! Riddick gets carted off to a prison planet for half the film and the naughty legions are virtually forgotten about till much nearer the end.I think this film split fans right down the middle, myself included. The original film was a semi serious, semi grounded sci-fi thriller/horror that was gritty, dark (no pun intended), not many over fancy effects, adult based and had a small fry cast. It wasn't original, a typical alien/last man standing survival thriller but limitations brought the best out in the final product. This sequel was completely the opposite of that first film, everything they did right for 'Pitch Black' they pretty much did wrong for this, polar opposites. Its amazing how the Hollywood bigwigs never seem to learn. This film was chock full of massive CGI effects, in your face effects, lots of gun fights, lots of fisticuffs, big CGI alien creatures, big CGI ships and stunt men flying all over the place. The cast is bigger and of a higher grade, sets are bigger and deeper, costumes are much more lavish and most importantly, the biggest issue (as usual), they went with a PG-13 rating. There obviously weren't as many limitations for this bigger budgeted flick as the Riddick universe has been greatly expanded, which isn't totally a bad thing I might add. But as usual, the first film did surprisingly well so the bigwigs wanted another film which would capitalise on the new franchises popularity. In order to do this they demand a watered down film for the wider audience which is bigger in every aspect. I did also get the feeling that Riddick was suppose to be a mere human in the first film, but the character has been massively over expanded in this sequel. I say over expanded because clearly in the first film none of this stuff had been intended, it was (I think) just a band of humans fighting aliens after crash landing. The creators were simply able to shove all this into the films universe afterwards to make this sequel more explosive and interesting...I think.So we end up with this sci-fi which has totally lost its gritty beginnings and has now become much more of a 'Flash Gordon-like' fantasy. The bad guys are basically Romans in space with a suspiciously 'Dune-esque' appearance. There is a silly elemental race of aliens that look like something out of 'Harry Potter', a bleak clichéd prison planet, clichéd 'Jedi-like' spiritual moments and the evil hordes aren't really explained. Why do they wish to convert everyone? what is their religion exactly? do they brainwash people? what happens to get those marks on their necks exactly? where do they come from? what is this 'underverse'?, what is their goal?, is their leader a half dead spirit of some kind?, can you tell us more about the 'Quasi-Deads' please...I also think the actor playing the lead villain was trying too hard to make a memorable bad guy, felt a bit too forced to me.Despite all that and the obvious selling out by everyone involved (if they had a choice that is), the film is still highly enjoyable. For me this is down to a few things, firstly the visuals. Now I know I just said the original works better for lack of glossy CGI, but I simply can't deny that this film looks crisp n sexy, if you like the sci-fi genre then you can't go wrong. Its that trashy pulp sci-fi appeal with a dash of space opera that appeals so much, of course its expensive pulp sci-fi but I have to admit I liked the atmosphere here.The other reason is simply the main character of Riddick. This guy is your typical musclebound hard ass sure but he looks distinctive with his glowing eyes, his particular blades of choice and of course the goggles. As I said in my 'Pitch Black' review this guy is like the new 'Snake Plissken' but in space, he just oozes coolness. Along with Riddick I must also mention 'Toombs' who is another great character that I'd like to see more off. A bounty hunter with a ruff 'Han Solo-ish' appearance and a real bad attitude, great stuff.So yeah, despite all its clichéd guff, muddled plot and general unoriginal silliness, the film is (for me at least) quite enjoyable. It does remind me very much of 'Star Trek Into Darkness' in the fact that both films are basically crap...but still enjoyable sci-fi romps in their own way. You just gotta look past the crapola and have fun with the science fiction if you can (more here than in 'Into Darkness' I might add).

65,Bob-45,Eating the Elephant,7,24 December 2004,"""The Chronicles of Riddick"" is a fast, eye-popping action movie, well cast and acted and with some of the most memorable special effects and art direction I remember seeing. Unfortunately, Writer-director David Twohy was more than a bit TOO ambitious, and overloaded the film with too darn many characters and subplots. He either needed to pull a ""Sergio Leone"" and make a three hour movie or do a ""Matrix: Reloaded/Revolutions gambit and film two features at the same time. The movie begins falling apart after the attack on New Mecca and almost never recovers. I also believe it was a mistake to make both the Judy Densch character in the Lord Marshall capable of astral projection. Dench's character doesn't need this talent and her ability detracts from wonder of the Lord Marshall's.WARNING: SPOILERS The ending of ""The Chronicles of Riddick"" seems entirely appropriate, if awfully downbeat. Everyone Riddick has ever cared about is dead, and he is being worshiped as the leader of a society of murderers. What a fitting reward for a career murderer.END OF SPOILERS I give ""The Chronicles of Riddick"" a solid ""7"".",The Chronicles of Riddick
66,jon.h.ochiai,Another Kind of Evil,7,18 June 2004,"In the prologue of ""The Chronicles of Riddick"", Dame Judi Dench as Aereon, leader of the Elemental race, declares that to battle great evil sometimes requires ""another kind of evil"". That ""evil"" she speaks of would be Riddick, played by Vin Diesel. Perhaps Riddick (Diesel) is another kind of evil. Although he seems more the classic rogue warrior, beholding to none, who eventually transcends to an avatar. He becomes the chosen one in a battle between good and evil-- a battle that initially was never his nor did have any stake in it. David Towhy's ""Chronicles of Riddick"", which follows the main character of his ""Pitch Black"", is very unwieldy, needlessly convoluted, and ambitious in scale and scope. That being said, I enjoyed the movie largely because of Vin Diesel, and the appeal of the character Riddick. Here is the deal. The Elementals are some kind of ethereal guardian race, who follow some sort of doctrine of non-intervention. Ultimately, they are part of the storyline. The great evil are the Necromongers, a ruthless fascist military race, bent on the genocide of all humans throughout the galaxy. Their leader is the omnipotent, Lord Marshall (Colm Feore). The dark Lord is hinted to be ""half living and..."" Aereon (Dench) prophesies that the powerful Lord will die by the hand of a Furion, member of the extinct elite warrior race. In the prophesy, Riddick is that Furion. Hence, the mythology is in place. Unlike the very poorly done messiah tale of ""The Matrix Revolutions"", Twohy's ""Riddick"" does not really take itself so seriously. This is a good thing. ""Chronicles"" is set five years after the prisoner, Riddick, and survivors escaped the deadly planet in ""Pitch Black"". Bounty hunters tracking Riddick, bring him out of seclusion and back to civilization on Helion II. There he seeks out his old friend, Iman (Keith David). Riddick thinks that Iman had betrayed him to bounty hunters. He does so, but discovers that the young boy, Jack, with whom they escaped was really a girl, Kyra. Kyra (Alexa Davalos) has the story that Riddick abandoned her, when he had intended to protect her from harm by leaving her and Iman. Kyra in turn has become like Riddick, now a murderous inmate on a planetary penitentiary. This is a rather forced plot twist which works in this story. Having Jack be Kyra lends compassion to Riddick which is a cool character paradox. One of the endearing aspects of Diesel as Riddick is that he does not care about anyone, including himself. Kyra gives him something worth fighting for. While on Helion Riddick, witnesses the sheer brutality and ruthlessness of the Necromongers. He also demonstrates his fearlessness and awesome warrior prowess. The battle lines are drawn, and Riddick must surrender to his destiny... or not. Twohy's story is very kluged, though his direction has effective pace and energy. Some of the action is sharply edited in a quick cut style which makes details difficult to discern. ""The Chronicles of Riddick"" really relies on the powerful presence and intensity of Vin Diesel. Diesel is at his best playing bad boy, loner heroes, and muting the hero's compassion. Really, he is great at underplaying this. John Riddick is just more of an updated gangsta version of John Rambo. Diesel has a great voice, and is in awesome shape to perform the fighting sequences. Colm Feore is a formidable adversary as Lord Marshall. Judi Dench, who is great in whatever role she plays, must have been well compensated for Aereon, because she does not have much to do in this movie. The only other standout is Alexa Davalos as Kyra. She is beautiful, strong, athletic, and full of rage. Her Kyra is a great foil to Riddick; thus, serving to humanize his character. I enjoyed ""The Chronicles of Riddick"" and admire the star power of Vin Diesel. ""Riddick"" looks to be a movie franchise. It would be great if Twohy in the sequel expands and deepens the character, instead of just amping up the action. Vin Diesel is suited for these kinds of movies (I really would not like see him in a romantic comedy); however, he might select more challenging roles and movies that capitalize on his charisma, and develop his range and power. He is already a movie star. I also think he can be a powerful actor.",The Chronicles of Riddick

Come on guys, lighten up. This film delivers pretty much exactly on its promises, nothing more, nothing less. It is basically a live action Sci-Fi comic book, which is pretty much how it sold itself.

Sure, if you really think about this movie's storyline, or, even worse, well-understood laws of physics, it's total nonsense, but that's not the point.

68,petra_ste,Mediocre script sinks a nice-looking movie,6,4 May 2008,"Pitch Black was a competent, straightforward monster movie in a sci-fi setting. This sequel is more ambitious in scale and scope, but ultimately fails because of its writing. The movie is overplotted, with trite tropes like prophecies, dark lords and chosen ones, names sounding suspiciously like sci-fi fan fiction (Furyan, Necromonger, Crematoria...). Worse, it's chock-full of vignettes with the only purpose of assuring us that Riddick is ""cool"". Everything is about him; all other characters are cannon fodder.Pitch Black had Radha Mitchell's character, who introduced an element of vulnerability. Here, apart for the beginning of the final duel (a snicker-inducing fight with a supersonic Feore), Riddick is always in control of the situation, which is dramatically unsatisfying.The Chronicles of Riddick is all first and middle act - which are silly but reasonably fun - while the final section is both rushed and clunky, sounding like the creation of a dungeon master who, late at night, is running out of ideas and starts spewing cretinous nonsense to reach some sort of closure. Interesting elements like the Necromonger's cult are left unexplored; there are some puzzling non-sequiturs, like the whole subplot with Thandie Newton and Karl Urban (it's like Macbeth without regicide). Diesel has perfected his growling assassin shtick: the only expression he needs here is the half-ferocious, half-sardonic ""I'm coming to get you!"" stare. Feore is an unmemorable villain; I blame the script and not the actor (see his very creepy turn in Storm of the Century). The highlight is lovely Alexa Davalos, who is excellent (but sadly underused) as Riddick's putative sister Kyra.The movie looks fine; Twohy is a gifted visual filmmaker. Like his colleague Shyamalan, he should probably stick to direction. Personally, I would have traded all those majestic shots of Riddick running in slow-mo with his cape trailing behind his back for a few more interesting characters, more screen time for Davalos and a meatier conclusion.5.5/10",The Chronicles of Riddick
69,juliankennedy23,Hey it's a Space Opera that's the guy from Amadeus,6,19 February 2005,"Chronicles of Riddick: 6/10: This movie reminded me very much of Dune. Not because of the opulent sets and costumes but simply because for the first 30 minutes or so I had absolutely no idea what was going on. Now keep in mind I saw and loved Pitch Black (And if there was any justice in Hollywood Rahda Mitchell would be getting 20 million dollar paychecks and Van Diesel would be doing walk on roles in Colin Farrell vehicles) and I saw that 30-minute anime that was supposed to fill in the plot (needless to say it doesn't). Dune was criticized for a ponderous 15 minute opening narration and while I wouldn't inflict that on any movie some idea of what is going on was clearly in order. The movie quickly hits a low point with seizure inducing battle flashes and a little girl melting Riddick's heart in a scene right out of the Grinch Stole Christmas. But as soon as I was reaching for the eject button the movie strangely morph's into Alien 3 (or Star Trek VI the Undiscovered Country take your pick.) See Riddick was going to save Jack the twelve year old girl who pretended to be a boy and now looks and dresses like a supermodel because she is safely located in an otherwise all male prison. Yeah that one kind of lost me too. However the action scenes pick up again and enough back story drifts in so that the biblical/Shakespearian plot comes into focus. You see Riddick was born on a planet called Kryptonite, and then he was placed in the reeds to escape the pharaoh or was it King Herod. anyway the guy married to Lady Mac Beth. No! Not the one with the Billy Ray Cyrus mullet. He was Lady Mac Beth's lover Lancelot. See clear as day.Sure the bad guy wears that mask from Amadeus and his troops look like Gwar started a dance troop. But many of the sets and costumes carry the day. The special effects are very well done (with the possible exception of the CGI Hellhounds) and the music certainly could have been worse. The basic problem is the three main characters left over from Pitch Black have gotten the warm and fuzzies. I've explained supermodel Jack above and I understand why the Imam character had to be significantly toned down post 9/11 but why change Riddick? He hugs puppies (okay Hellhounds) and children. All the appeal of the character from the first movie seems to be missing. He still talks the talk but the walk is very different. Looks like someone lost a pair.",The Chronicles of Riddick
70,gregsrants,Stylishly great. Too bad it stars Mr. Diesel,6,14 June 2004,"Can a movie that is all style and no substance get a recommendation in a review?  That is the question I had to pose to myself after screening the new Vin Diesel film, The Chronicles of Riddick.  But before I get around to trying to answer my own question, let's first try and determine how this movie ever came to maturity in the first place.  Back in 2000, writer/director David Twohy introduced us to the character of Richard B. Riddick.  He was a criminal, a murderer and was being transferred to a new holding facility.  The ship they were traveling however crashed on a distant planet, and the crew had to look to the skills of their prisoner for help (his eyes had been sanded down allowing him to see in the dark) as creatures began to feast on their presence.  Three survived.Skip ahead to 2004, and Twohy and Diesel are back for The Chronicles of Riddick which continue the adventures of the title character as he battles with a warlord that devours worlds and turns cultures into mindless warriors with allegiance only to him.  Riddick gets caught in a battle between the army's leader, Lord Marshall and his own agenda while the fate of a world and the people Riddick cares for hangs in the balance.  Will Riddick be able to defeat the evil Lord Marshall and free the people on alien worlds of the terror forthcoming?  Will Riddick be able to find and reconcile with the girl (Jack) he saved in Pitch Black?  And can Riddick free himself of the bounty put on his head and return from a life in exile?  The answers my friends can be found neatly encompassed in the 2-hour running time of the sequel that leaves the characters future wide open for a third.When I first heard that there was going to be a sequel with the Pitch Black character I had to wonder why.  I was unaware of any cult following or icon status of the Riddick persona. So, if the public is not demanding a sequel, then why would the director and star return for another engagement?   The answer became pretty clear early on in the film as The Chronicles of Riddick proved to have more substance than its predecessor.  Whereas the first film was a cheap thriller that had but one real scene that gripped audiences in the trailer, Chronicles has more of a story, and its supporting cast which includes Judi Dench who was put to good use to help develop the overall plot.   However, let's not put this film in our Top 100 Sci-Movies of all time just yet.  There is one glaring issue with Chronicles and that is with Mr. Diesel himself.   His opening lines to a mercenary trying to collect a bounty was an inferior written scene and this being our first exposure to Riddick, I spent the next 15 minutes trying to forget how corny and poorly the lines were delivered.  And Twohy and Diesel seem happy to recapture to unglory years of the 80's by having their star ramble off one liners and grunts that would make Stallone look like a Shakespearean actor.   Vin Diesel can fight, but his acting ability is exactly put to the test here.I would also take issue with the villain in the film played with ease by Colm Feore.  Too much ease, actually.  We don't really come to hate or fully understand Lord Marshall, and it wouldn't have taken more than a scene or too extra to help relay his motivation.  A cross between Hitler and George Bush, Lord Marshall was just a pawn for the Riddick characters screen time and without a villain to really despise, the film lacked the stand up and cheer for the hero that could have resulted.But then comes the boom in the form of the films effects and design.  With its ships of mass-destruction and the sun melting burning through a planets surface, the $100 plus budget was put to good use.  The interior of the mother ship was both interesting and creative in its design and that was a refreshing twist from the steel and metal ships we normally encounter in films of this genre.Pitch Black earned less than $50 million at the box office, so it took some balls for Universal Studio's to fork over $120 for a sequel.  But now that it is over, I'm kinda glad they did.  If in the third film, we can continue on its upward spiral of improvement for each film, we may get something of real substance in another few years.So now to answer the question that I put forth at the beginning.  Can a movie that is all style and no substance get a recommendation in a review? I guess the answer is yes'. www.gregsrants.com",The Chronicles of Riddick

72,TheNorthernMonkee,dumb fun with a few teasing references,7,6 July 2005,"SPOILERS Science fiction is a difficult genre to comment on. Sometimes as part of a continuing series your personal prejudices can disguise you from the truth about a film or programme. At the same time, all too often it is easy to chastise and insult a film for not producing elements which shouldn't really be expected from this genre. So when you watch 'The Chronicles of Riddick' it's hard to know what to say. The plot is very segregated and uneven and the acting is hardly outstanding. At the same time though, this film is action packed and entertaining with the occasional bit of comedy. Clearly taking attributes from major films (a strong feeling of 'Dune' throughout and one line even reflects a well known line from 'Blade Runner'), 'The Chronicles of Riddick' doesn't take itself seriously, and this helps make it an entertaining film well worth watching, but not worth putting much thought into.Five years after the events of 'Pitch Black', Richard B Riddick (Vin Diesel) is living on an ice planet evading mercenaries. After being attacked Riddick goes to see old friend Imam (Keith David) where he learns of a race called the Necromongers. A fascist army marching across the Galaxy looking for their holy place, this race convert or destroy all in their path. Unlucky for them though, their path is about to be stopped by the unintentional involvement of everyones bright eyed menace.After a hectic start, 'The Chronicles of Riddick' really finds it's footing as our anti-hero begins to dominate the universe once more. Led by a sturdy but far from impressive performance by Vin Diesel, the film also boasts average performances by Thandie Newton (playing a form of futuristic Lady Macbeth), Karl Urban and most surprising of all, Judi Dench.Still, when you watch films like this, you don't watch it for the acting. As far as entertainment goes, it's good fun. Occasionally confusing due to an awkwardly written script, the film is saved by some excellent set pieces and some equally good comedy moments (mostly provided by Nick Chinlund's mercenary Toombs). Combined these times make the film all the more enjoyable.Weak in acting and plot, 'The Chronicles of Riddick' is still a fun piece of science fiction. Entertaining special effects and some comedy moments ultimately work together to make this film worth watching on a quiet night in. Leave your brain at the door and enjoy.",The Chronicles of Riddick
73,russem31,Not very good,5,24 December 2005,"In this eagerly awaited sequel to Pitch Black, unfortunately unlike the far superior original, The Chronicles of Riddick tries to be epic where it shouldn't have been. Unlike the original, which took place only in one location, thus able to allow the audience to see the main characters interact and develop with each other as they try to survive, in this film, there are numerous locations and even more characters, making such character development impossible. One clear example of this is Judi Dench's role as Aereon - she has very little screen time and absolutely no reason to be on screen (it's a waste of a role of such a great actress). This sequel to Pitch Black is disappointing to say the least - 5 out of 10.",The Chronicles of Riddick

77,movieguy1021,The Chronicles of Riddick: 5/10,5,18 June 2004,"I always make a note to see movies before their sequels come out. That way, if I want to see a specific movie that's a sequel, I'll be able to understand it. However, I made an exception to the rules when The Chronicles of Riddick came out. Most people had never heard of Pitch Black (the movie on which Riddick is based), so calling the movie Pitch Black 2 would leave much of the audience out. But it drew me in. It looked simply like a brainless thriller, something entertaining. For the most part, it did its job.Riddick (Vin Diesel) is a hunted man-people go to kill him, as he has a bounty on his head. However, it seems that he his bigger fish to fry. The Necromongers are a Nazi-ish race who are out either destroying or converting everyone in their path en route to a Nirvana they call the Underverse. Riddick's race (of which, of course, he's the only one left) is the only one that can supposedly defeat them, but much like (a little too much like, for my tastes) Brad Pitt in Troy, he works for himself only. He runs around as continuity errors occur and Dame Judi Dench pops in randomly from time to time.What I went in for I mainly got. It was entertaining in most of the action scenes, until they became repetitive. Diesel may be an atrocious actor, but he's an alright action star, and with the help of MANY special effects, a pretty good ass-kicker. His fighting was entertaining and fun to watch. However, about halfway through the movie, everything seemed to be repeating itself. Something new needed to come into the mix, but nothing did. Since it didn't have a strong plot to tie it all together, it was hard for it to keep my attention towards the end.Director/writer David Twohy is mainly to blame for most of the things that went wrong. His script is pretty much awful, and he's filling the cliché that every no-holds-barred action hero has to be this sarcastic stand-up comic. It reminded me of Hellboy. Riddick is supposed to be this mean guy pumped full of hate, but I guess he has a heart of gold, so he always has to make light of the situation. Also, Twohy seems to flaunt that after his low-budget Pitch Black, a studio trusted him enough for over $100 million for special effects, so he better use them. Dench's character pops in to use this $100 million. Many of the effects are so cheesy they could be accepted in low-budget movies, but this is for $100 million. And, to make matters worse, in many of the scenes where there's all CGI, Riddick becomes an animated character! How's THAT for acting?When Riddick and co. land on Crematoria (basically a death row penal colony...cremate...get it? My God, Twohy is so funny!), there appears to be no atmosphere, as the temperature is a straight fluctuation between about 1000 degrees on the opposite sides. Yet the temperature remains normal whenever they go out, and they can survive without atmosphere. Before you say ""these are not humans"", some of them were. And I'm not going to go into the ""outrunning the sun"" sequence that's even more far-fetched than the one in Die Another Day. But don't let me dissuade you. If you're for a mediocre but usually entertaining ride, go see Riddick. No one's stopping you.My rating: 5/10Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of violent action and some language.",The Chronicles of Riddick
78,dr_foreman,Deserving of Riddick-ule,3,24 May 2007,"Sometimes, I think science fiction fans will automatically love anything with aliens and spaceships, regardless of whether it's actually any good. I hate to sound obnoxious, but some fans really don't seem to discern between quality entertainment featuring spaceships, and total dreck featuring spaceships - like ""The Chronicles of Riddick."" I mean, really, I can't think of a single original idea in this movie's script. It's a cut-and-paste version of ""Flash Gordon"" and ""Star Wars,"" complete with a cannibalized mythology which is expounded upon at tedious length. The villainous Necromongers, with their dull philosophizing about life and death, come across like lame Conan knockoffs (and utterly fail to appear even minutely menacing). Poor Judi Dench, meanwhile, is forced to flit about in special effects form and explain all the baloney rules of this particular baloney sci-fi universe.Perhaps I could forgive the movie if it looked good. But the fight scenes are disjointed, and the special effects are as fake-looking as they are elaborate. Besides, the whole aesthetic is too reminiscent of ""The Fifth Element,"" another overdone sci-fi film that failed to capture a broad audience.I don't think I'm a particularly brilliant writer, but if you gave me a legal pad, a pen, and a weekend in a secluded cabin, I could probably write a better sci-fi film than this one. I could certainly dream up a richer and more imaginative sci-fi Universe, too - preferably one free of Necromongers, Furians, and really hot planets called ""Crematoria.""",The Chronicles of Riddick
79,Laakbaar,Space epic,8,30 November 2012,"After a second viewing, I still think this is a grand, epic, rollicking space opera of the old-school variety. Vin Diesel is not my favourite actor, but his character grew on me in this movie. Riddick is one bad-ass ice-cool swaggering, relentless Furian.An IMDb score of 6.5 is rather too low. I hope no one allows themselves to be dissuaded from seeing the movie because of that. If someone other than Diesel had played the main role, I'm sure it would have scored better. But who else could have pulled it off? Schwarzenegger, in his early days? Some of the comments made by the critics (i.e. impenetrable, baroque, convoluted, cool-guy posing, one-liners, overblown, frenetic, humorless, rampage, devoted to metal) are not wrong per se; it's just none of this detracted from my enjoyment of the movie. Indeed, these may be the very strong points of the film.It's a sit-on-the-edge-of-your-seat science-fiction action thriller, sort of a cross between Dune, the Borg, Star Wars and Alien (without the alien). The movie is hugely dependent on special effects. I can't say it was really that original or realistic or mature, but it was well made and entertaining enough.

The story has enough detal to warrant multiple films and tie-ins and borrows ideals and trappings from a lot of great science fiction films (anywhere from Dune, Stargate and Flash Gordon to name a few) and twirls it together to create an interesting and fun, but familiar romp to a galaxyfar, far away. Written and directed by Pitch Black's David Twohy the film actually turns out well. Very nice costume and production design and even more suprising is that the visual effects were actually really good. Not over-produced like Universal's Van Helsing disaster. Not too flashy and they don't take you out of the film.

Riddick was introduced in the sci-fi thriller Pitch Black, the titular killer returned in this bigger, more expensive, more action-packed follow-up. The Chronicles of Riddick ditches all the horror aspects of its predecessor and focuses much more on otherworldly fantasy and sci-fi action; it finds itself more at home among films like Dune or Star Wars than it does with Pitch Black. This film's style is extravagant, but loaded with high-impact fights, big-scale battle scenes, and highly-imaginative planetscapes. Fans of Pitch Black might be disappointed that the horror has been stripped away from the franchise.I, on the other hand, find the deviation most refreshing. TCoR expands its horizons far and wide, filling up Riddick's universe with entire planets full of warring societies, exotic cultures, grungy rogue factions, and loads of fascinating technology. There is a massive plethora of cool spaceships, weird weaponry, imaginative worlds, and unique ideas crammed in this film. It makes for a vivid, entertaining, and imaginative piece of sci-fi.The story is a little derivative. The plot hops around from one act to another, carrying the characters from one fight to another, along a path that's well-worn from plenty of other sci-fi stories. What matters the most, however, is the return of Riddick as a character, who continues to steal the show as the main antihero, once again relied upon as the monster to fight other monsters for the greater good. Other characters are generally flat, but fans may recognize returning characters from the first film, who evolve in interesting new ways. Villains are generally one-dimensional, but while Pitch Black was filled with characters I found unlikable, TCoR has characters I found genuinely endearing.This film is loaded with style, using quality photography. Editing can get very fast and hectic during the action scenes, although I believe the action scenes in Pitch Black were worse yet. Acting is generally good: Vin Diesel plays it tough and cool as the title character, while Colm Feore, Karl Urban, Thandie Newton, and Judi Dench all do the same. Writing is generally okay. This production uses loads of great-looking sets, props, costumes, and special effects. Music is okay.This film has a director's cut available on DVD and Blu-Ray, which offers fifteen minutes of new footage. A lot of it is devoted to detailing Riddick's background and heritage, which can be a hit or a miss with audiences.If you like horror more than action, maybe you'll like Pitch Black. If you like action over horror (like me), maybe you'll like this one better. If you like sci-fi in general, you might like them both (also like me). Altogether, these two Riddick films constitute a unique and entertaining duology that should be worth renting.4/5 (Entertainment: Very Good | Story: Pretty Good | Film: Good)",The Chronicles of Riddick
84,AKS-6,Pretty entertaining,6,3 January 2005,"I really like the first Riddick movie Pitch Black. I watch it at least once a year. One of the things that I like about it is its simplicity when it comes to plot and the fact that over time you come to care about the murderer Riddick. The perfect unwilling hero with a nice character arc.So, now we have the sequel. It does not have a simple plot in the same way as Pitch Black. There are Necromongers, mercs, prison planets, elementals(?) and so on and so on. I honestly think that a follow up to Pitch Black should have had another set up/structure. My favourite part in The Chronicles of Riddick is the scenes where Riddick, Kyra and their fellow prisoners run across the surface of Crematoria, staying away from both the cold and the deadly heat of the sunrise. I like it because it is in many ways similar to the pitch black scenes in Pitch Black. The scenes have the same feeling and the same structure, but the Chronicles... scenes are different enough from the Pitch Black scenes to still be interesting.As I said before, a follow up to Pitch Black should have had another set up/structure. I would certainly have preferred a much more simple plot. Perhaps a movie that *focused* on getting Jack/Kyra away from Crematoria.However, that is not what The Chronicles of Riddick is. It is a big movie with big ideas. Sometimes it's too pompous for its own good and some lines are absolutely cringe-worthy and silly. But I must say that I was entertained almost all the time, so I can't say I'm very disappointed. I just think a smaller movie could have been so much better.As for the acting, Judi Dench doesn't have to do very much and I can't say I'm very impressed with what she does do. Not that she's bad. Thandie Newton does a rather good Lady Macbeth-like character. Alexa Davalos is great as Kyra. She really kicked some ass and looked cool while doing it. And Vin Diesel... He is Riddick. I know he's probably not a very good actor, but he was made to play Riddick, I tell you.So, this one gets a 6 out of 10 for the entertainment value.",The Chronicles of Riddick

You can see his ideas now well developed and supported by good special effects. He patches most of what was lacking in the first installment, except for one dimensional characters, but my guess is that's intentional. There's also a number of logical flaws still left in the scenario.In this chapter, you get fully fledged and totally original ideas, that really transport you to a different world. and by the end, you simply want to know more about that universe. What other incredible things might be hiding there?The acting is on par with the previous flick, average, but no more.

Second, you came light, a four man crew for me f#@king insulting but the worst mistake you made, empty gun rack. Also when the Necromonger lord asked him to bow, he replied: I bow to no man. If you are not in the Riddick army, I advise you take some time from you busy schedule to join in, by watching this well-crafted movie. The movie wasn't all that perfect there were some lapse in the story telling and then there were some things that didn't well correlate, but in the end the whole action scene and the whole idea of this night seer made the movie worth it.Now there was a short animation movie that was done and released a day or so after this movie and it was done to bridge the gap between Pitch Black and this movie, the name of the 30 minutes animation was The Chronicles of Riddick: dark fury, which tells us how Jack got left with Imam.Now Riddick is back at New Mecca to see Imam (after five years since they parted) when he heard that Jack has gone looking for him. Riddick learnt of a new threat that is swooping in on the universe the name of the pirates are the Necromongers and there is some prophesy that a Furyan (which is race that Riddick is from) will kill the leader of this new race, which are dead but alive.Well the movie displays some very cool fight scenes that I will tell you. There were some areas where Riddick even did the impossible, by killing a guy with a cup.The movie also gave a brief introduction to who Riddick is and where he is from and how come there is only he left of his race. The Chronicles of Riddick has a nice cult following that I myself I'm a full member, after the film I made sure I saw the animation and also played the game. The Chronicles of Riddick didn't do well in the box office, but its DVD sales were massive and so was the sale of the video game (The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay) that followed, on Xbox and on PC.There seem to be another Riddick movie coming out this September, the budget is lower there than this movie but no matter, I can do with some more Riddick, what about you?www.lagsreviews.com",The Chronicles of Riddick
87,PyrolyticCarbon,"A great sci-fi \ action epic, but the Riddick character is poor compared to Pitch Black.",7,9 December 2005,"I loved Pitch Black (PB), it took many of the great features of the Alien series and combined them with a hard, edgy character. much like Ripley in Alien:Resurrection. It also pulled open the confines of the corridors and space ships into an entire planet, populated with insurmountable odds stacked against the useless humans.Those features endeared me to the movie and made me love the character of Riddick. So it's somewhat disappointing to see The Chronicles of Riddick and discover that the edge has gone.Movie The big disappointment for me is that it loses what PB was all about, and it's difficult to understand why it does this, but I think it's down to the scale of the movie. Whereas PB was small, confined by the darkness, and a few people against a multitude of the same creatures, this movie is all about the galaxy struggling against a huge race of all sorts of creatures converted to one cause. It's all a bit too big and unfocused.Another aspect that seems to lose something in the sequel move is of the character Riddick, in this movie he just doesn't seem so threatening and so dangerous. In PB he was an unstoppable killing machine who had virtually no morality at all, yet here, he's portrayed much more as a normal guy with a heart who can fight more than the average guy. Here it really does lose the essence of the original.That said, he does seem to be able to easily kill these guys, and that's another thing, they just look like guys in suits. This is nothing compared to the predatory killers of PB. So again not only is Riddick's cold blooded unstoppable killer status lowered, but so is the ferociousness of the enemy, where they instead rely on huge spaceships and overwhelming force.Saying that, the scenes of the ships and conquering force appearing are visually superb, and that carries through all the effects of the movie, they are believable and highly engaging, totally immersing you in the universe. They don't stand out either, so that when you cut to a small set scene in the city streets, you aren't suddenly wrenched from one style to another. They are very well done, and combined with some of the action sequences, they make for some stunning scenes.Yet the action sequences are also a point of contention with me, for the trend of zooming the camera into the action and performing multiple fast cuts, is getting out of hand in Hollywood and it's destroying movies with fight scenes. This is one reason why movies such as Ong Bak are working so well nowadays. It's especially prevalent in this movie, and despite the added attraction of Vin Diesel having learnt some of the moves in the art of double knife fighting (it has some specific name which I can't actually remember), yet for all that we see nothing in these fight sequences, and I really mean nothing.The one plot aspect that really did make me wonder why was the addition of a mini-Riddick in the guise of the recast role of Jack. It seemed a poor plot device that she had grown to be just like him and that he had sacrificed his entire life to protect her. This is a huge change from his original character who would have left any of them to die in PB, had it not been for an affinity with the pilot Fry and a feeling of obligation.However much this character has changed, Diesel is excellent as Riddick and it is a character I would like to see again, although much more in the PB style of the character. This film definitely needed more focus on that character.Picture Presented: 2.35:1 Anamorphic The picture is superb, there's no real difference to tell between the CGI aspects and the real scenes with the mood being matched well between both. The cinematography of both is excellent, although heavily let down in the fight scenes, the opening attack on the planet is quite stunning.Audio Presented: Dolby Digital 5.1 I would have loved for a DTS track on this movie, whatever version, however the 5.1 is bold and competent. Plenty of LFE mix and base kicking in with good use of the spatial aspects of 5.1. It was very good and loud audio track.Overall The movie is a great sci-fi \ action epic, and it's very enjoyable entertainment presented in a visually stunning style. You truly appreciate the size and scope of this movie, and it does make you want to see more of Riddick. However it doesn't stay true to the original characterisation for me, and I felt this was a poor aspect of the movie, it really did lose what Riddick was all about.The DVD is a good package, although you really have to like the movie to sit through many of these extras. The inclusion of the game demo is a great cross marketing ploy, but also gives the viewer some extra lifetime on their purchase.",The Chronicles of Riddick
88,ronbell-23984,Really good movie,8,18 October 2019,"I really enjoyed this movie. Very different storyline, it's a blend or noir and Sci Fi set in a dystopian world. Great characters, excellent visually. The action is impressive. The characters are solid. There's nothing to hate about this movie, surprised it gets so many poor reviews else I watched something different to many reviewers.",The Chronicles of Riddick
89,supertom-3,Decent entertainment but ultimately failed potential!,6,16 September 2004,"As a big fan of Pitch Black, this film was something that I was really looking forward to. With the scale and the production value in it the potential was great for a great piece of sci-fi cinema. The film is at the end of the day though failed promise but at the same time is still entertaining and there are enough positives for me to have enjoyed it. Now this film is what essentially has to set up a whole elaborate Star Wars/LOTR epic sci-fi story of good vs evil, something of biblical proportions. The problem arises though that this is only a two hour film and it has to start this elaborate mythology from scratch because Pitch Black made no hint of anything that is to occur in here, it was a small modest and extremely enjoyable b-movie contained in its own little world. The film ends with many ideas introduced and glossed over, things like Elementals, Necromongers, Furyans and the Underverse but come the films conclusion you have little idea what all these things are, where they are from and their purpose. You know the basics like the Necromongers are the bad guys, half dead, half something else, who convert or kill everything in the worlds they destroy, much like the Empire in Star Wars. There are too many unanswered questions because they tried to cram so much into the film, essentially 5 hours of material into a 2 hour film, like the Matrix sequels did. I must say however I enjoyed this more than revolutions, but I found Reloaded was better than this film.I have played the video game on the XBOX and watched Dark Fury and that opens out some dark corners of the film which in all helps up the film slightly from how I might have viewed it without that extra assumed knowledge. The story becomes instantly complex and although imaginative they tried to cram too much into one film but having said that if they had done less there would need to be more sequels than the planned three because I imagine things will get a whole lot more complex down the evolution of the story and since the film suffered poor box office results around the world it looks unlikely the sequels will shoot. I would like to see more Riddick though, I did enjoy this film and the game and anime where both excellent, the game in particular was great and many say had a better story than this film.What I did enjoy in this film though was firstly the production design and the sheer scale of it. Okay so they shot themselves in the foot by saying that this would be of LOTR scale, which in truth it is around about. This film is massive but comparing it to a modern classic like the Rings series in any department means it will be compared with the overall quality of the films and in this respect Riddick falls far short. The sets are vast and intricate and there is your requisite number of effects for a tent-pole Universal film. David Twohy does well and has a strong visual eye it must be said. The cinematography is striking and the various settings all catch the eye. He also produces some top action scenes.As for the character of Riddick himself, I thought he was a great and dark creation. He was highly effective as an ambiguous presence in Pitch Black and he had a dark energy about him which Diesel perfectly portrayed. This film may mark another flop for Diesel since XXX but it marks his first good role since Pitch Black and while Riddick doesn't have the same dramatic impact as he did in Pitch Black he is still as charismatic, dark and multi faceted as he was in PB. A key reason Riddick isn't as chilling as he was and doesn't have a dramatic impact is that now he is the main character, the protagonist. He is the centre piece. In Pitch Black it in some ways followed Riddick, he gives the voice over at the beginning but the film was not from his perspective he was on the outside looking in and how he interacted with the crew was really what made the film so popular. Diesel dark and growling performance made that film and while this is a good role for him again it doesn't have the same presence. Riddick is still cool, charismatic and a total badass but he is now protagonist rather than antagonist and I prefer him as the latter. Now all of a sudden Riddick becomes like Neo in the Matrix, a saviour, the key to human survival but with the added twist that Riddick is solely looking out for numero uno to start with. Does it really work having this loner and murdering person the key to defeating the evil Necromongors, really and truly its too far fetched but one thing I am glad of is that Riddick doesn't suddenly gain superhuman powers, that would have taken the biscuit. So basically the film looks fantastic, the action is good and also the story keeps you interested despite being full of plot holes yet to be answered. The rest of the cast are good to. Nick Chinlund is very good as Toombs, a bounty hunter looking for Riddick. Then there is the sudden up and coming Karl Urban who starred in LOTR2+3 and Bourne Supremacy, he is also solid. Colm Feore hams it as the villain of the piece in typical hammy sci-fi mode for megalomaniacs. Thandie Newton grates in this in an almost Shakespearean role that is too over the top, she's a kind of lady Macbeth who always has a new costume for each scene she is in. It is best to view her as some eye candy and it is a sweet candy. All her costumes just seem to scream 'look at these babies!' All I can say in reply is 'Yowzer!' The eyebrow raising, head scratching casting of Dame Judi Dench is very strange indeed but she adds class to her role. The rest of the cast are good.The score is also very good certainly the most epic and grandiose score I have heard from Graeme Revell. He is one of those composers who is very hit and miss but he hits it on the head in this and I'm glad to see he use the Pitch Black theme. Overall this is worth watching, it concludes in a way you could leave on it's own but at the same time leaves things wide open for the sequels which inevitably won't happen. Diesel is back on form acting wise and the film is certainly eye catching. It tries a bit too hard at times to be Star Wars and to be Shakespeare but I certainly found it had a better story and more dramatic impact than most blockbusters. It is one that has enough in it to entertain with a lot more imaginations from the majority of the summer fare. ***",The Chronicles of Riddick
90,charchuk,"Cool visuals, but a disappointing story",8,14 March 2007,"Pretty adept sci-fi action flick, with an okay mythology and some cool visuals. Though the backstory has some nice concepts, it does have a 'been there, done that' feel to it, and the main story is actually kinda weak. The acting, apart from Diesel, is pretty terrible, and even Vin isn't as charismatic as he was in Pitch Black. Judi Dench is completely wasted. It's solidly directed, though, and the effects are pretty good, save for a few anomalies (the tiger things in the prison). The action sequences are pretty well done, save for the 'running away from daylight', which is a stupid concept and has been done ad nauseaum before. Some of the visuals are stunning, especially the Necromongers attacking at the beginning. Great score, too.",The Chronicles of Riddick
91,johnnymacbest,Director's Cut is MUCH better.,8,25 April 2010,"Having been a fan of Pitch Black I decided to skip the theatrical version and watch the director's cut. It is so much better than the original. I don't understand why the studio chopped this movie up? Riddick was meant to be a brutal killer with some semblance of honor; PG-13 rated dross water downed his character significantly. With the DC you get more story, more character development,more action, more suspense, and just more of everything you expect of the Riddick character with more visceral brutal action. So in the end, if you want to see the true Riddick then buy the DC. It's a whole lot better than the ""water downed"" piece of trash that is the theatrical version.",The Chronicles of Riddick
92,christian123,Worst Action Flick of 2004,3,29 May 2005,"The Chronicles of Riddick may seem like a cool movie but behind all the special effects, it isn't. Richard Riddick (Diesel), the anti-hero from Pitch Black is back. This time, the space fugitive with night vision is being chased across the galaxy by mercenaries out to collect the price on his head. On the planet Helion, he encounters Lord Marshal (Colm Feore) and his invading warriors the Necromongers, and when Riddick is imprisoned, he must escape and put a stop to Marshal's evil reign. The plot sounds like it has some potential but the execution was done poorly. Pitch Black was fairly entertaining but this sequel is far from entertaining and its one of the worst films of 2004. What's wrong with this film? Well first the acting isn't very good though, this isn't very surprising. Judi Dench did the best job out of everyone else though she isn't in the film for a long time. Vin Diesel didn't talk in the first one yet he does so in this film and that's not a good thing. He is a passable actor in some films but in a couple of films, his performance is really bad. Thandie Newton and Colm Feore both give bad and forgettable performances. This is one film they both should leave off their resumes. David Twohy does an okay job of directing but I'm surprised how he could have messed up this one after doing a good job on the original. The dialog in the film is bad and unintentionally funny. The action scenes are average and none really stand out either. The special effects are done really well yet sometimes they go overboard with them. The characters could have been handled better. The story is weak and it does become very silly at times. The ending was done alright but it was also kind of dumb. The main problem with this movie is that it's boring. There were hardly any entertaining moments in it. It's only two hours long but it feels so much longer. They also tamed the film, giving it a PG-13 rating. This made the film ruin the first one and made Riddick seem a lot weaker. In the end, The Chronicles of Riddick is a very disappointing sequel to Pitch Black. It's also just a bad Sci-Fi action flick in general and not worth watching. Rating 3/10, you're better of if you just skip this.",The Chronicles of Riddick
93,LivingDog,9/10 not as action packed,9,1 January 2005,"The time line of this movie is 5 years after Riddick escaped from the dark planet in ""Pitch Black."" It is well worth watching since Vin Diesel is more than up to this role bringing the character of Riddick (back) to life. All of the gymnastic choreographic scenes are believable and Vin is totally the person for this role.""Pitch Black"" held me on the edge of my seat, but this one is a bit thin in places with less action than I like. Also, the role of the girl (who appeared in ""Pitch Black"") who looked like a boy was ... ""upgraded"" quite a bit. That I didn't like since, in my opinion, it was done to sell tickets. Fine, but it ruined the true vitality of the movie for me and drained some of its energy. 9/10.-ZafoidPS: if you haven't seen ""Pitch Black"" that's OK b/c you don't have to see these movies in sequence.

94,Prof-Hieronymos-Grost,Creditable sequel thats expands on Riddicks past,7,19 January 2009,"Tracked down to a remote icy planet by some bounty hunters, Riddick happy in his isolation, easily sees off their laughable challenge, but he's intelligent enough to know he must leave and find out who has such a high bounty on his head. He finds out an old friend has betrayed him, but the whole thing has been a devious plan to get him out of hiding to save the universe from the onslaught of the Necromongers, a race that destroys all in its path unless their victims agree to join them. Riddick is at first uninterested in saving the world, but after being confronted by the Necromongers he soon finds the taste for revenge.

95,Danny_G13,"Despite a slow and boring first hour, it picks up",6,8 January 2005,"Slow starter with ponderous direction, which seems to be getting the better of it, manages to pull out the stops in the second half to leave the viewer reasonably satisfied.Chronicles of Riddick is a type of follow up to Pitch Black, once again featuring Hollywood's new Arnie, Vin Diesel in the title role. An outlaw with more enemies than Charles Manson, Riddick's constantly got a bounty on him and an endless queue of takers trying to make cash on his head.Eventually he, as you would expect, gets embroiled in some kind of battle between good and evil all in the name of Jack who (I think) he abandoned at the end of Pitch Black in order to have the headhunters pursuing him and not Jack.Put it this way, it makes little coherent sense just like these sci-fi popcorn efforts are generally guilty of, so when it comes to figuring out the plot, it's a losing battle.Indeed, the sole purpose of this movie are the special effects, a reasonably entertaining lead in Diesel, and the action sequences.Unfortunately the biggest sin it commits is to be utterly dull for its first half; it just doesn't go anywhere and confuses while it remains static. Indeed, I half expected this to end up a 3 out of 10.However, with a massive increase in the pace of the plot and the action in the second half, the movie saved itself big time. No one wants a pedestrian and tedious action movie, they want excitement and thrills, and although it takes a while, Riddick eventually delivers.Performances are par for the course, and no worse than expected. Diesel does a good job of veering on the right side of corny; he's really suited to these action man roles. The rest of the players are merely staple but a pointless character played by the completely miscast Dame Judie Dench is a definite black mark. She's totally a fish out of water here, and while she's as professional and charismatic as she always is, she just seems to emit a sense of 'why am I here?'.Anyway, ignoring that, and accepting that the first half is devoid of any enjoyment, you should enjoy this for what it is - a brainless popcorn action movie with shiny effects and loud bangs.Nothing more, nothing less.",The Chronicles of Riddick
96,Quicksand,Pitch Brown,8,11 June 2004,"Early IMDB reviews don't seem favorable, so let me be among the first to put out there that this isn't a BAD film.  If it weren't a sequel, my lone complaint is that they deliberately cut all the violence to make it PG-13. This has always been a horrible idea; it takes the realness away from the characters and turns the story into a cartoon.  But other than that-- as a stand alone movie it's fast-paced, tightly plotted and has many interesting characters, who show much promise until the final act, which I'll get to in a moment.The problem, here, is that ""Chronicles"" is indeed a sequel.  ""Pitch Black"" was at its soul about character-- Riddick, yes, but also the inner beings of the other characters in that film, both those who survived and those who didn't.  In ""Chronicles,"" the film even starts with some nice character set-up, and vaguely tries to cling to that now and again throughout.... then jettisons it all together in the final 20 minutes, as if the studio said, ""Kill everyone who isn't Riddick, cuz that's the franchise.""  They've forgotten that by NOT making the first film about Riddick, he became the most popular character Diesel has ever played.  Making this film about Diesel the way ""Timecop"" was about Jean-Claude Van Damme just makes me sick of the whole thing.I like the film, I can recommend it, it is certainly not the worst movie to come along this summer (worse: ""Van Helsing,"" and ""Hellboy,"" just off the top of my head).  But the brain and heart that I found so nifty in the superior ""Pitch Black"" has been replaced by muscle and PG-13 carnage.  So in that respect, Diesel gets to appear in ""2 Fast 2 Furious"" after all.",The Chronicles of Riddick
97,CelluloidRehab,Riddick the Barbarian,7,24 June 2004,"After seeing Pitch Black numerous times the character of Riddick was cemented in my head as a consummate loner type. All he seemed to care about was getting away, being left alone and not being tied down. Well this movie evolves the character of Riddick. Even though Riddick is a loner, he can learn to be human. This movie has to be taken past what is obviously there (action movie) into another level : the growth and development of Riddick as a human being. This movie is far from perfect. It is a little too ambitious and the dialogue at times is very cartoonish and silly. It tries to become an epic in that it includes extravagant battle scenes (aka Star Wars) which don't really do anything for the story, but are there for eye candy. It is clear that a majority of the budget for this movie went into the cg, when it should have gone more into the story. Riddick works because he is a gritty character. He is someone who has lived an incredibly harsh existence and still manages to survive despite all the odds against him. He succeeds where all others fail, and that is his appeal. I do hope the financial failure of this movie does not detract from the making of the rest of the trilogy. I think when making the next movies one should look more carefully at Pitch Black and Escape from Butcher Bay (XBox game) to see how to keep the story compelling and focused on Riddick.",The Chronicles of Riddick
98,rollernerd,Threshold!! Take me to the threshold!!,7,22 August 2020,"Welcome to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue in intro music**Threshold!! Take me to the threshold!!Tonight's movie review is the second entry to the Riddick series, the action adventure sci-fi The Chronicles of Riddick (2004) where criminal fugitive Riddick played by the furious Vin Diesel is on the run after the events from the first flick. This film in a context is an excellent introduction of this character's universe/galaxy. We get to know key principle players in this overall story and snapshots of where Riddick hails from. Riddick escapes a group of mercenaries who wants to obtain the bounty on his head and finds himself seeking refuge on the planet of Helion Prime, only to discover he's walked into a mass invasion by an empire with an army called Necromongers where they either convert or kill all humans in the universe.Now similar to Pitch Black, this flick is a B-grade style science fiction flick buttt damnnn it has great entertainment and never ever slows down. We have a character known as the Lord Marshal who is the main bad dude warrior priest who is the leader the of the Necromongers and will help humans go into the Underverse. Then we have Dame Judi Dench playing an Elemental who is trying to reveal Riddick's his true origins from his home planet Furya.The who prison story is awesome especially the animalistic scene and the character Vaako played by Karl Urban is another great addition to the series. Thandie Newton's character as Vaako's ambitious wife brings out a Lady Macbeth to the performance and brings out how there is always background noise in an authoritarian regime. The characters from Riddick to Vaako to Kyra had some great depth however would be good to know what happened to Guv (watch for the dude in the prison story). The dialogue is awesome especially the way Diesel delivers his scenes in a cool slick manner. I really enjoyed this flick and a great way to continue the series. Again, no expectations and definitely no comparisons to other well-known sci-fi films. Just a basic sci-fi flick with good action and good substance around a completely new galaxy with a quick witted and calculating anti-hero trying to survive. The story is solid and even though it is has a cheesy script, still does well for entertainment purposes, overall 7.7/10",The Chronicles of Riddick
99,shanfloyd,Though markedly different from 'Pitch Black'... still quite entertaining,7,19 February 2006,"'The Chronicles of Riddick' is miles apart from its prequel in every aspect, especially in mood. While 'Pitch Black' is dark, slow and suspenseful character drama on sci-fi plot, '...Riddick' is primarily a fast roller-coaster ride of spectacular sci-fi action. The special visual effects are really of superior status. The script is smart and the story is well-designed. Vin Diesel here is more of a ""Xander Cage + Riddick"" persona. The cast also includes Thandie Newton in a really irritating role, the cool Karl Urban as a Necromonger officer and Alexa Davalos as Riddick's protégé Jack/Kyra.For Pitch Black fans, it's not exactly a must-see. But for general fans of the sci-fi genre, its quite recommended.",The Chronicles of Riddick

The special effects and the production design are Oscar worthy.  Vin Diesel is definitely an effective action hero.  However, the film is too long and ends up a Star Wars wannabe.  An entire sequence set in a prison feels like something from another movie.  Instead of developing the villains better, the movie gets distracted in this subplot. The movie does come around at the end with an ending I didn't expect.  I really missed Radha Mitchell from Pitch Black.  She had genuine chemistry with Vin Diesel.  However, since she is not in the sequel, there is really nobody to stand with Riddick in this movie.  Judy Dench is wasted in a supporting role.

The film lost what the first film had, with all its flaws, brutality and dark atmosphere. The director's version improved things somewhat, but the film failed precisely because of the PG-13 rating, making it lukewarm and too soft compared to the first part.

102,basrutten,A complete and utter mess,2,14 January 2006,"I was never much of a fan of the original ""Pitck Black"" anyway, but compared to ""The Chronicles of Riddick"", the first movie in the series is Oscar material. This installment in the admittedly potentially interesting Riddick universe is a complete and utter mess.First, there's the plot, or lack thereof. I don't know whether the script was just plain bad to begin with, or whether heavy editing is responsible for this fiasco, but this is one of the most incoherent movies I've ever seen. The plot moves of in all possible directions, with huge leaps in logics and gaping plot holes. Hardly anything is ever properly explained, and character development is literally non-existent.Perhaps this wouldn't be so bad if the movie didn't take itself so awfully seriously. Alas, it does. It tries really hard to be deep and epic, while it's almost the definition of the opposite: shallow and awfully silly. Prepare to laugh out loud at quasi-deep and pretentious dialog, daft names for aliens and races, and enormously fake costumes. Are we sure that the director's twelve-year old son didn't write this? Even the action sequences are a mess. They suffer from such a horrible case of music video editing, which makes it almost impossible to keep track of what is going on. Not that anybody cares anyway, but still. The PG-12 rating doesn't help either: most of the action (provided you can figure it out) is really lame.Are there no bright spots whatsoever then? Well, the special effects are generally decent (if overused), there are a couple of one-liners that might provoke a smile, and there's Eye-Candy, eh Thandi Newton.In the end I still think that the character of Riddick holds potential for some really cool stories, but this is definitely not one them. Instead, it's a loud, incoherent, silly mess that should be avoided whenever possible.* out of *****",The Chronicles of Riddick

The film is brilliant, funny and action-packed but not too serious. It manages to combine elements of Sci-fi and fantasy in a way that only Star Wars has only succeeded before. What's great is that they were able to make the film personified and not so sterile as some other sci-fi films I've seen. Though some scenes vividly reminded me of scenes in other sci-fi and fantasy films, this point didn't distract me too much.The film's only weaknesses are that in places the dialogue was not always the best possible and I think that they downplayed Riddick's original weakness too much in this film.

104,Bruce722,Really good sequel bit lost some of the charm of the first one.,7,6 September 2013,"The Chronicles of Riddick fails to deliver on a lot of what made the first one so unique. The sci- fi mixed with horror element from the first one is largely lost as this sequel essentially feels like a darker version of a Star Wars movie and is void of horror vibe. It also seemed like they changed Riddick's character a bit. I'm not knocking the movie for this as it's possible that this was just the evolution of his character after the events of the first film but his moral compass was much more ambiguous in Pitch Black. There were also a few areas, most notably some of the scenes on Crematoria, that were just completely and totally ignoring realism. Granted, this is a fiction film so I have suspended my disbelief quite a bit but even some of those scenes were beyond my suspension. For the things they lost, however, there were some definite positives. The plot was more involved and was very well told. I also liked how they tied in the two films. A 5-year gap is a pretty big one but you feel like you didn't miss a thing and that means good planning and writing. Karl Urban and Thandie Newton play decent roles but Alexa Davalos' performance of Kyra steals the show, outside of Vin Diesel being a B.A. that is. The camera absolutely loves her and how she hasn't had more roles in the past decade is beyond me. Overall, I think this film stands alone well and is a really good sequel but they definitely lost part of the charm of the first one.",The Chronicles of Riddick
105,the_wolf_imdb,2 points for visuals,2,29 November 2008,"This movie is really very pretty, render of the scifi worlds is top quality.

The problem with the movie is that it is one big personal advertising for Diesel. He is SOOOOO bad-ass, SOOOOO hard, harder than Bruce Willis, harder than Rock, harder then Chuck Norris. He is cool, he can hypnotize the animals, he can master any situation, he visits hardest prisons just because he wants to, he can eliminate invincible armies, he can save the Universe, he can do everything. He seems to be God of War incarnate, without slightest weakness, which makes him absolutely funny. Riddick is not believable action hero, he is just plastic action hero dummy. The complete movie is held by his überego alone, it makes absolutely no sense without him. Other parts of the movie are just fancy visuals to demonstrate His Absolute Greatness - the story is completely unbelievable and totally crappy. The movie is essentially about nothing - it begins with just some random situation and ends without ending. No story, no depth, nothing, just action so Vin can Win. Except the visuals it is extremely pathetic.",The Chronicles of Riddick
106,rparham,"Aims high, misses the target just a bit",6,12 June 2004,"With The Chronicles of Riddick, director David Twohy has decided to move away from smaller, low budget pictures that have been his bread and butter to date and create a full blown sci-fi epic.  While he falls a little short of hitting the bullseye, he offers up the first intriguing sci-fi film I have seen in a little while, so while he might receive a B- for execution, he gets an A for effort.The Chronicles of Riddick is a sequel, of sorts, to 2000's Pitch Black, a little Alien-inspired thriller that introduced us to the character of Riddick, a convict who is out for himself, until the final moments of Pitch Black where he changes, a little, in the face of responsibility of the loss of a life he felt should have been his.  The Chronicles of Riddick picks up five years later, with Riddick hiding out on an ice planet and being chased by bounty hunters who have been sent by another survivor of Pitch Black, Imam (Keith David), who believes that Riddick may fulfill a prophecy that will save his home world of Helion Prime from the clutches of the Necromongers, an interstellar army/religious movement that is attempting to convert the entire universe to their way of thinking.  When Riddick is discovered by the Necromongers to be of the race that could bring down the Necromongers, their leader, the Lord Marshall (Colm Feore) calls for Riddick to be destroyed, but after escaping, he is instead captured by bounty hunters, led by Tooms (Nick Chinlund), and taken to the prison planet Crematoria, where he encounters the other survivor of Pitch Black, the girl posing as a boy Jack, now known as Kyra (Alexa Davlos), who has decided to take up crime as well and managed to get caught.  Meanwhile, Dame Vaako (Thandie Newton), the wife of Necromonger commander Lord Vaako (Karl Urban), has decided to use Riddick as a vehicle to allow her husband to assume control of the Necromongers.There is an abundance of story here, but that is also the film's prime weakness.  If the Chronicles of Riddick has a key flaw, it is having too much material, at least for one film.  The Necromongers are interesting, but unfortunately under-explained and under-developed.  A sci-fi amalgam of Nazis and religious cultists, the Necromongers convert humans from the planets they conquer, but what this conversion is is not clear.  Is it a brain-washing, a physical alteration, or something else?  Also, the prime goal of the Necromongers is to reach an alternate-reality called the Underverse, so why exactly are they conquering worlds?  It doesn't seem to forward this goal, so is it just power hunger, or something else?  Along with these developments are Riddick's search for Kyra on Crematoria, which consumes a good third of the film, and could almost belong in it's own picture.  Some of this material is strong, but it is another level of complexity in an already complex film.  Also, some characters that would seem to be key to the plot, such as Aereon (Judi Dench), a member of the elemental race that has informed Imam of the prophecy about Riddick, are given some interesting set-up, but end up just blending into the background.Visually, The Chronicles of Riddick has a wide, almost dwarfing, scope.  It visits multiple planets filled with wondrous sights, and has a great look to it.  The production design of the film, by Holger Gross, is fabulous, especially the baroque looking Necromonger environs.  I really liked the duality of Crematoria, with it's rising sun that transforms the surface into a blazing inferno destroying anything in it's path.  That being said, to realize these sights involves a lot of visual effects, which range from good to pretty lame.  The weakest of them are two ravenous pets in the Crematoria prison that look ridiculously cartoonish, and not the least bit convincing. The strongest work are the vistas of the planets the Necromongers visit, but the duality of quality is glaring. Twohy also jumbles the look of his film in the fight scenes a little too much.  Some are engaging, others are just a bunch of flash and noise without much coherence.  I suppose it was a deliberate style choice, but whatever the reason, it just doesn't work.The Chronicles of Riddick also falls victim to quite a range in the quality of acting.  While the leads are all decent, some of the supporting characters, especially the prison guards on Crematoria, are rather poor, to point of almost being laughable at times.  That being said, Vin Diesel acquits himself fairly well in this film, after having had a few recent flops to his name.  Diesel, while hardly a great actor, is, like Arnold Schwarzenegger, good when paired with the right material, and that is the case with The Chronicles of Riddick.  He fits the part and gets the job done.  Another standout is Nick Chinlund as Tooms.  He may have an overall small part, but he is good with what he is given.In the end, I applaud David Twohy for aiming high and delivering some of the goods.  If the film was a little more polished, the results could be spectacular, but as it stands, The Chronicles of Riddick is just decent.",The Chronicles of Riddick
107,Alex-372,Excellent Low Budget Sci-fi,7,5 November 2005,"Chronicles Of Riddick is the followup movie to the lower budget Pitch Black. Both movies are almost standard Science Fiction b-movie turf. Gladiator meets The Evil Dead meets The Matrix meets Aliens.Thandiwe Newton is AWESOME. Vin Diesel has a very intelligent, wicked sense of humor. It was odd to see Judie Dench away from her ""M"" role in James Bond.Finally, this is a Black movie, in the way that Shaft was back in the seventies. For the first time, a Black hero gets to be the hero. No sidekicks like in Blade, no taking bs from anyone, no weakness at all, which is what makes Riddick such an attractive character. Even when he is captured, Riddick is in control.It has taken Hollywood a century to come this far. I say: finally. Let the trend continue.The 'World Ending"" scenes are amazing. However, some of the action is badly considered (for instance, when a sunrise comes raging toward you, that raises the temperature to 300 degrees, sitting behind a rock isn't going to help). Not that the final chase scenes in the Alien series are anything to write home about, but at least the writer could have tried.Anyway, still an amazing picture, if you like low budget scifi.",The Chronicles of Riddick

109,lotus_chief,Suprisingly good....a worthy sequel.,8,27 June 2004,"I walked into 'Chronicles of Riddick' expecting absolute trash.  Seeing only the trailer, it just seemed too disjointed from the brilliant original, Pitch Black.  I'm not a big fan of Vin Diesel, but I liked him in the original, and I like him here as well.  The Riddick character just seems to be tailor-made for him, and it's right in the realm of his acting abilities. The story here is much more grand than in the original, and it's a welcomed extension of the Riddick universe.  I was suprised to be sold on the additions; the filmmakers wanted to go in a different direction, and they succeeded in doing so without alienating the fans of the original Pitch Black, of which I was.  They even brought back a couple of characters from the original, and the 'villians' (although everyone here is a villian) were even more mysterious.  The special effects are very nice, painting the futuristic world very nicely.  The film gets straight to the point, as far as the story goes, of course more could've been explained about the Necromongers, the 'world-destroyers'....but the fact that they did not doesn't really take anything AWAY from the film.  I was suprised that I enjoyed 'Chronicles' so much, its one of the better films I've seen so far this year; and I'm glad that the makers were able to keep up the quality of their franchise with this addition.  We'll see if they decide to add yet another sequel to these two sci-fi gems, but I'm glad to say that they're '2 for 2'.*** out of **** stars.",The Chronicles of Riddick
110,gazineo-1,Chronicles of Nothing!,2,20 July 2004,"Senseless, simple-minded sci-fi/action movie, almost a sequel to B'movie 'Pitch Black', also starring Mr. Diesel, the new muscle man on the spot nowday (some people say that he is the heir of Sylvester Stallone). This movie has all the time a frantic timing, with lights exploding everywhere, and you'll think that it's not a movie but maybe a nonsense party. This is the main problem with 'Chronicles of Riddick'; an absolute confused and unconvincing story, based on a bad narrative. In just twenty minutes, any viewer with minimum good taste will find that it's another awful and sensacionalist production of stupid sci-fi, following the path of others of the same kind (as 'Battlefield Earth', for example). Another problem (and a great one, to be sure) is Mr. Vin Diesel, in another zombie-like performance. In fact, Mr Diesel is playing again his best parsonage up to date: Mr. Vin Diesel. Even the presence of some good actors, like Colm Feore and Miss Judy Dench, can save the day. Finally, a warning to everyone: 'Chronicles of Riddick' is the worst movie of 2004. I give this a 2 (two).",The Chronicles of Riddick
111,honorhorror,If not the odd art design...,7,18 June 2009,"The Chronicles of Riddick is enjoyable, and showed the ambition of the project team. It seems they try to drive this little-scaled sci-fi thriller into whole a space opera like Star Wars. Thus, there's no doubt it received so many negative reviews and rated 6.4, not to mention the box office performance.Back in 2000, the first Riddick movie, Pitch Black was a minor success, due to the right budgeting and controlling. Its core, the Riddick character, had potential to become a long-run action hero who attracts billion dollars. In TCOR, Riddick was profoundly developed and always had the right tone to entertain the audiences. He is the anti-hero that bend your mind and have all your problems solved his way. ""Evil fight evil"" theme was still there and evolved into a full scale epic involving universe wars and more diversified human races. All in all,manage to concentrate on the protagonist and you won't be disappointed.A lot fans are wondering why the movie was criticized so harshly. Frankly speaking, there are just way too many flaws, though none of them is devastating. One big issue is the story. Even those who loved PB will find it a little hard to follow everything because of the space opera type background and production set. The background of the story was expanded into something not necessary, involving too many supernatural elements, making it more far-fetched than all the successful fantasies(LOTR, Star Wars, etc...)If they try to tune these fantasy elements down and concentrate on characters(like they did in the more phenomenal video game TCOR:EFBB), the story would always be heading the right direction. It's a pity they didn't. Here you can tell they really pay tributes to Dragon Ball(Riddick is one of the last surviving Furian who kills the dark lord in a prophecy, sounds familiar?), Macbeth(the Vaako couple's conspiracy) and so many tales. Even if you can accept the weird art design, you will still have a lot Dejavus with the story.The biggest problem is the art direction. The realistic artistic design of PB was totally thrown away by this sequel. The movie had so many good concepts, like the bio-tech based communication device Necros used to scan Riddick's memory. And the extremely-temperated planet Crematoria on which they had to land just between daylight and night, was also cool. But the weird, overdone art design ruined them all. Imagine the storm troopers in Star Wars all wearing medieval armors. Riddick fights with them in consistent martial styles, too. That doesn't really give you something new, but fell totally parody. TCOR is far less atmospheric than PB thus less involving and intriguing. For most of the two hours length, the screen is saturated with these stuff, severely reduced Riddick's dark and magical charming......If you want to appreciate the movie more, you'd have to play some Riddick games.7/10",The Chronicles of Riddick
112,krycek19,What is Judi Dench doing in this crap?,1,7 October 2014,"Not that I like her, but for her to have a small supporting role in a Vin Diesel picture is just weird.As for the movie itself, it sucks serious ass. Vin Diesel is not even the problem here. He delivers a decent performance, in spite of the material.The fact that this crap get 10/10 from certain users, tells me, there are more pimpled 13 year old boys on IMDb, than there are adult users.Apart from the rating (Vin Diesel is thrown around and is taking a serious ass kicking and he only bleeds a little bit. When people are stabbed, there is no blood etc. But the awful CGI is the movies biggest problem.It's even worse than in the Star Wars prequels. Whether its a landscape or a spaceship, it looks completely fake. And that's not good enough even for a 10 year old movie. I can make more convincing effects with apps on my iPhone.And the spaceships look like giantbath-tubs and heaters. And the badguys wears armor, like medieval times with a futuristic twist. Actually they just look gay and they all speak like they're in a Shakespearian play.Avoid this!!",The Chronicles of Riddick
113,fredericksmith1952,"Once again Vin Diesel brings to life the vicious, calculating anti-hero Riddick",10,19 March 2012,"Once again Vin Diesel brings to life the vicious, calculating anti-hero Riddick, the convict who prefers to kill instead of negotiate. Riddick is living a life of arduous survival, preferring the isolation of the frozen planet to the company of humans. When he learns the Imam is the man who has set the bounty for him, he journeys to discover why. Keith David recreates the Imam from Pitch Black as if he had never left the role, and introduces us to Aereon, the elemental being in the form of Judi Dench, whose powerful acting and presence adds both drama and authenticity to the film. Nick Chinlund excels in a role custom made for him, and Colm Feore is magnificent as the Lord Marshal, the holy half-dead who has seen the Underverse. Linus Roache, in one of two films he has worked on with Diesel (the other, Find Me Guilty, perhaps led to his role as the Assistant DA on Law and Order), and while his role is not as big as I would have liked, his presence and eloquence as the Purifier adds significantly to the film. Karl Urban, who has appeared in other fantasy roles (Priest, Star Trek), presents a more powerful, controlled soldier of the faith, while Thandie Newton as his ambitious wife provides the right balance to the struggle for power within any authoritarian regime. Alexa Davalos is excellent as Kyra, defiant and deadly to the last. Even the extended version is rated PG-13 for language and violence, but little sexual content. Since Vin will be recreating Riddick in a third film next year, I would say this is a collectible if you are a fan of the first two, or just a fan of good science fiction.",The Chronicles of Riddick
114,oshram-3,Better than I expected,7,14 June 2004,"I never saw Pitch Black, the movie that Riddick is the sequel to. I've been told by various sources that it either wasn't that bad or it sucked, but most people told me it was very similar to an Alien movie, only that it took place in the dark, and that Vin Diesel was apparently pretty good in it. I'm no big Diesel fan but he does have a certain charisma, and when he's right for a role he can be pretty good.So I went into Riddick blind and ignorant (I had just seen the Stepford Wives an hour beforehand, and that could have had something to do with it), not knowing what to expect other than the juicy visuals promised in the trailer. I was surprised, however, that unlike many films this summer, Riddick didn't stink.I was lost for the first fifteen minutes or so as the story picks up several years after the Pitch Black and Riddick (Diesel) reunites with an Imam (Keith David) whom he had befriended in the first film (apparently). When the goofily named Necromongers come a-callin', Riddick tries to protect the Imam and his family, but complications ensue and through various action-related plot mechanics he ends up on a prison world half inspired by Aliens 3 and half inspired by Star Trek VI's Rura Penthe. Riddick, while incarcerated, first proves he's a bad ass, and then he runs into Jack, a tomboy from the first film who has sprouted into Kyra (the lovely Alexa Davalos). Kyra's now a bad ass too, and yadda yadda they have to get off the planet and fulfill some vague sort of prophesy about Riddick taking out the head of the Necromongers. All very Dune by the way of a video game mentality.The visuals are in fact stunning. Riddick's prison planet is an unlivable hellhole, and the Imam's cultured planet, though rendered in brief strokes, is also visually appealing. They production design team saved their most impressive work for the Necromongers, however (all these good ideas and we couldn't have come up with a better name for them?), who sport intricately designed armor and fly in creepy gigantic art deco spaceships. Whether or not Riddick's world always makes sense is one issue, but it always looks terrific, I'll give them that.Diesel is fine here. He'll probably always be an actor of limited range but as Riddick he's found a skin he's very comfortable in, and he can play the edgy hero perfectly. He's the kind of character you want around when the crap goes down, but who you'd kind of fear the rest of the time, and Diesel is able to play that very well. Alexa Davalos, whom I had only ever seen on a few episodes of Angel, is very strong here, making quite an impression as Kyra. Her tough performance helps keep the film moving through what could have been a boring sequence on the prison planet. Colm Feore as the evil Lord Marshal is perfunctory  he doesn't have any of the charisma of most of the rest of the cast, but he does an adequate job playing some sort of evil Paul Maud'Dib, a guy with special powers who is the child of prophecy. I was very pleasantly surprised by the presence of Karl Urban, whom I'll always remember fondly as Julius Caesar on Xena (even though he's better known to most as Eomer from Lord of the Rings). Urban plays Vaako, the Lord Marshal's chief lieutenant, dispatched to kill Riddick. He isn't given much to do other than brood, but Urban gives him a nice presence  especially since he has to suffer through a lot of scenes with overacting hack Thandie Newton, chosen apparently so she could fill out any number of snakeskin costumes rather than for any thespian skill. Newton's Dame Vaako is an attempt to inject a Lady McBeth into the setting, but she never really works. And lastly there's Dame Judi Densch, who plays little more than a glorified Bene Gesserit, called in this world an Elemental. She adds a little class to the proceedings, though her role is somewhat small (I credit Diesel for her casting, as I read he went to great lengths to personally woo her to bring her on board).Riddick isn't a sci-fi masterpiece, but it is a good bit more entertaining and intelligent than I would have guessed. Having several lesser-known actors who stepped up helped the film a great deal, and a very nicely done ending doesn't hurt either (the plot is suitably all tied up, and yet is left at a point that really does leave you wanting to know what happens next, not an easy feat). I guess at this point if you don't like Vin Diesel, you never will, but to me he seems to recognize his boundaries and in Riddick he plays to his strengths. And, honestly, this will probably be the best movie inspired by Dune ever made (though it has nothing to do with Herbert's work, someone very clearly was a big fan of at least the first few  read, 'good'  books). Riddick may be a summer film, but it's a summer film with a little bit of a brain to go with its eye candy, and that, especially in sci-fi, is exceedingly rare.June 12, 2004",The Chronicles of Riddick

Vin didn't seem to need a terrible amount of acting skill for this role. ""Please talk like the governor of California for the entire film please, Mr. Diesel. We'll handle the rest."" I'm sure the conversation went something like that when this was in negotiation. It was sci-fi, but without any purpose or explanation as to why things worked as they did in this world. You have Dame Dench disappearing, but what exactly is her people? Her story? The movie behaved like Star Wars by creating characters from outer space, but refused to explain why they could do the things they do. Why they were even apart of the major storyline. Thandie was alright, but what much else could she do besides attempt to walk around in that skintight dress? I'm at a loss for the whole mythology behind everyone worshiping this weird dead war god type thing. I love Karl Urban, ever since the days of Xena (I watch all alum), but his great acting was unnecessary in this film, because his motivations made no sense. He was confusing in an already confusing movie. Then, the two characters you recognize for Pitch Black are killed off. Umm...aren't they kinda necessary to maintaining a fan base?

118,w00f,Two Hours of Special Effects in Search of a Movie,1,15 June 2004,"One of the first lessons of movie-watching; never waste time on a movie where the lead actor is also a producer. All too often, such films end up a someone's vehicle for themself, and that's exactly what this movie is. It's an even worse situation where the actor/producer is a very bad actor, which is what Vin Diesel is.The problems start from the very outset of the film. There's a back story here that goes beyond it's predecessor, ""Pitch Black."" Things are talked about that the viewer has no clue to. Even the contrived use of a narration at the beginning of the film and the tried-and-failed ""let's hear what's going on in the character's head"" convenience (a la ""Dune: The Disaster"") can't straighten things out. The thoughts in Vin Diesel's head, it seems, ring as hollow as his performance. Even to use the word ""performance"" seems false.It seems that a good deal of thought went into finding dramatic ways for Riddick to remove his goggles. From the side, the back, the front... those goggles are so important that a prison guard at one point tells Riddick that he's going to keep them after Riddick dies. Who really cares? Jeez, spend the $10 and go buy a pair of swim goggles at Target like everyone else!This is, as far as I could figure out, supposed to be an action film. That makes it especially sad that the action sequences, particularly the fights, are shot in such a choppy, flash-flash-flash manner that one can't see what's going on. I suspect that the director had a bunch of poorly choreographed, clunky sequences and had them edited for highlights, resulting in scenes that look more like a series of still photographs than a film.The script in this film is unbelievably bad. It tries so hard to be clever and catchy, and it ends up sounding amazingly stilted. For example, mercenaries are called ""merks."" The bad guys are the ""Necromongers,"" and Riddick is a member of the race of ""Furians."" PLEASE, STOP. Necromongers? Furians? It all comes out sounding more like the dialogue delivered by junior high school kids playing a role playing game like a script. Diesel's delivery, flat and listless, only adds to the desire to grab some earplugs and wish that one were enjoying a summer on Crematoria...If ""Riddick"" could have had one saving grace, it was the set design. The design was reminiscent of the work of H.R. Geiger in places, with good subtlety and eerie tones, bringing to mind everything from ""Alien"" to ""Hellraiser."" Unfortunately, even that peters out for long, tedious stretches of chase sequences across fake-looking desert mountains and forgettable caverns.All in all, ""The Chronicles of Riddick"" is really just a couple of tedious hours of special effects desperately in search of a story which, sadly for the audience, never materializes. If one can get past all of the shortcomings of this movie, then I suppose one could enjoy it. Of course, getting past all the shortcomings would involve walking straight past the theater and doing something more interesting... like watching paint dry, or screwing a cakestand into one's pelvis.The main problem with this film, though, is the misleading title. Two syllables were left off the end of the main character's name: ""u"" and ""lous.""",The Chronicles of Riddick
119,JPfanatic93,Riddick goes space opera,7,23 September 2013,"Overly bombastic and grandiose sequel to the much smaller scale Sci-Fi horror flick Pitch Black (2000), revealing director Twohy had near Star Warsian aspirations with the Riddick character, which despite the ambitious undertaking of this epic attempt never really materialized any further. Set some years after the events of Pitch Black, Chronicles of Riddick picks up with the continuing hunt for the dangerous anti-hero Riddick (Vin Diesel doing the only type of character he can pull off successfully: the grumpy, violent bullyboy with a heart of gold), though this time not so much for the bounty on his head, but more for the purpose of having him combat a new threat to the galaxy in the shape of the massive world-conquering army of Necromongers, who seek to convert all life to their semi-religious cause or kill it instead. Riddick has little interest in abandoning his quiet lonely life in the wilds, but hesitantly accepts, resulting in a fair amount of high adrenaline fight and chase sequences in a movie that looks terrific but is ultimately yet another haphazard play on the age-old 'good versus evil' routine. Though Riddick continues to be a fun character for his total lack of subtlety and cynical attitude, the rest of his universe is just a bit too weird to fully run along with. Also features Karl Urban (always a blast in this type of action film) as a Necromonger commander caught in a MacBeth type web of intrigue with his wife (Thandie Newton) out to persuade him to kill his dark overlord and take his place, as well as a small role for Judi Dench as an elemental spirit seeking to convince Riddick to be a force for good. Star Wars this is not, but if you take the silly names and bizarre characters with a grain of salt there's quite a few things to enjoy in this action flick. A third Riddick movie was in the works for many years and finally saw a release in 2013: unfortunately it largely ignored the events in this film and copied Pitch Black's plot instead.",The Chronicles of Riddick
120,Sci-FiHorrorFan,This film is extremely Underrated!.,10,16 October 2013,"I thought this film was Great! and I'm quite mind boggled by allot of the critics and IMDb members out there. Allot of people seem to think this film is bad for some reason,well i think its about time i set the record straight,this film is Not bad its actually very good! and the villains are also good and i hate to sound like a jerk but I'm afraid I'm going to have to say this to drill the message home to everyone. People need to (GET OVER) the fact that this film is not like PITCH BLACK!. that's all people ever say about this film and never anything good. Well guess what, i happen to like that its not like pitch black! i LIKE that its different!. what was everyone expecting?,for the sequel to be (EXACTLY) the SAME as the previous film. I hate to break it to people but that would be boring!. Pitch black may be a good film but i wouldn't want to see a film EXACTLY the same as pitch black.the director had the right idea by going with something different because he didn't want to keep Riddick on the same planet and in the same situation so he decided to change the story and change the character and that's a good idea!.For the life of me i don't understand peoples problems with the film. people say the bad guys are Cartoony??.well i Disagree i thought the bad guys were tough! and i liked The main Villain The Lord Marshal,i thought he was a cool villain and i thought the guy was portrayed very well by Colm Feore. what's sad is i'm probably the only guy in the world! that thought Colm Feore was a GOOD Villain!. no one else ever seems to say anything good about Colm Feore so heck if no one else will say anything then i will. I like Colm Feore as a bad guy and i thought he fit the role perfectly and i thought he played his role very well and he was very believable as the bad guy which shows me the guy is a good actor. I also liked Vin Diesel in the film i thought he was great as Riddick i thought he played his role well.I disagree with people about this film being a step down from pitch black.I thought it was a step UP!. I actually Like this Film More than pitch black!.Yes I said it Sue me. This film is about an Evil Army called Necromongers that want to convert all humans,and what's good about this film is Riddick's character was built up more and we now know more about him here than we did in the first film. I can see what the director was trying to do,and the people that hate the film obviously don't.people that don't like this film just can't stand the fact that its (different).News flash people different doesn't always mean worse.This film was different but in a good way.I thought this film had more Action than pitch black and i thought the film was very entertaining!. This film has great special effects! great visuals and very exciting fight scenes!. How on earth can anyone Not like the fight scenes in this Film???. I will never understand that. The fight scenes were Awesome! especially the fight at the end of the film when Riddick fights against the Evil Lord Marshal. I thought the fight they had at the end of the film was fantastic! i thought it was very entertaining and intense!. I'm probably the only guy in the world who loves that fight! but i don't care.i thought the ending fight in this film was better than the fight Riddick had with Johns in the first film. If people want to know why i think that then i'll explain why.the fight in this film is longer which makes it more exciting,and also the fight in this film was more intense and brutal!. Riddick and The Lord Marshal throw some hard punches at each other!. yet for some reason no one ever talks about the ending fight in this film, instead all people talk about is how great the fight in pitch black was.Sorry i Disagree,The fight in this film was better BY FAR!.the fights in this film had more IMPACT and Intensity,the fight in pitch black didn't have that.i was not impressed by the fight in pitch black. What i loved about that film were the Creatures! and what i loved about this film were the fights!. This film has Action from beginning to End but sadly that just doesn't seem to be good enough for people for some reason. The directors idea was to develop Riddicks character and make him seem more human and make him have feelings and that's a good idea!.people say they wanted Riddick to be Billy Badass just like he was in the first film but what they are failing to NOTICE is that he IS still a BADASS!. Riddick NEVER stopped being a Badass,he was a Badass in this Film too! in fact i thought he was even tougher in this film than he was in the first film!. There is a scene in this Film where Riddick kills about Ten Necromonger soldiers by himself! and he even takes a guys head off!. What? so Riddick doing all of that, that's not BADASS?. How can people not think that's Cool?. Riddick kicks a lot of Ass in this film! he kicks more Ass in this Film than he does in the first film!. Frankly that's why i like Chronicles More,that and the fact that this film is Action Packed!. People need to learn to just enjoy a Film and stop comparing it to the first film. And for people out there that say this film is too ""unrealistic"",NEWS FLASH ITS A (SCI-FI MOVIE) ABOUT DIFFERENT PLANETS! ITS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE REALISTIC! THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT!.",The Chronicles of Riddick
121,DanLives1980,The fate of the Universe falls into the hands of its most wanted criminal,8,6 April 2012,"I love reviewing older films, as anyone who's read the majority of my reviews would probably notice. You can find better reason in either the supporting or criticism of a film that's been better lived-in and been tested by time. Here I'll be saying mostly good things, so if you don't like this film, LOL, what are you even doing here? I'm one of few to admit that Diesel is a versatile actor that has more range than casting agents and producers fail to recognise simply because he has enough experience as a film producer, writer and director besides his career as an actor to point out that they're idiots that don't know the difference between viable industry veteran and sequel spawning has-been.His take on David Twohy's character, Richard P. Riddick, was as influential and intense as Kurt Russell's character redefining Snake Plissken from Escape From New York, or Sly Stallone's Rocky Balboa or John Rambo.The Chronicles Of Riddick was a science fiction fantasy sequel to low budget Aliens-esque sci-fi horror Pitch Black, about the attempts of a spaceship crew and its passengers marooned on a desert planet along with a bounty hunter and his captive, the extremely dangerous and seemingly psychopathic killer, Richard P. Riddick, who becomes their only chance of surviving a twenty year eclipse and a world inhabited by carnivorous creatures.The Chronicles had the potential to be the film that finally stole Star Wars' thunder, providing we got the final installment of what was meant to be a trilogy soon after, which the idiot studio producers refused to green-light.Not only did Riddick's sequel have better designed and created visuals and more imagination to it than any of Star Wars' three prequels, yes even the ones made after Chronicles was made, it sported better performances and was better directed than the entire Star Wars saga. A bold statement to make but The Chronicles Of Riddick took its time to turn a story into a thrilling adventure where the only thing you could guess right were the awesome fight scenes that the athletic and powerful Vin Diesel did so well.The story is that Riddick, years after his escape from the alien infested planet has gone on the run, leaving Imam and Jack to their own devices. Coming back to find Imam after giving bounty hunter Toombs the slip, he finds the world of Helion Prime under sudden invasion from a nomad civilisation of religious converts known as The Necromongers and after picking a fight with the supernaturally powerful leader, the Lord Marshall, ends up on the run being chased across the universe by the Necromonger's general Vaako, until gaining the knowledge that his home planet is next on their agenda.The Chronicles sported an awesome cast of actors and placed them in characters that kept you thinking; who would they side with and what was their real agenda? Keith David, Nick Chinlund, Colm Feore, Karl Urban, Thandie Newton and Dame Judy Dench provided one of the most colourful ranges of characters in a multistrand narrative film ever devoted to a science fiction fantasy.Keith David reprising his role as Imam from Pitch Black makes you feel right at home the moment you see him after the opening scenes. Nick Chinlund's Toobs character, replacing Cole Hauser's intergalactic bounty hunter Johns, plays the fish out of water character to a tee as the poorly equipped menace hunting Riddick.Feore, Newton and Urban have a hell of a Machiavellian drama of their own going on, which provides a great insight into the enemy and makes them more three-dimensional than most villains that side of the cosmos.All in all, the film not only boasts colourful characters played by good actors, it manages to make inventive fantastical characters that you can accept as ordinary human beings and not a hint of Jar Jar Binks in sight.The film is darkly humorous and razor sharp in terms of plot and character development, letting us in on much more of the psychology of Riddick as a character and it's brilliant seeing how he deals with the scum of the universe as opposed to flesh eating aliens. This film is where he becomes the epitome of the reluctant saviour; the definitive anti hero.He doesn't choose sides, you're either behind him or in front of him. He somehow manages to breathe respect for his support characters rather than voice it, retaining that animal instinct that defined him in Pitch Black. He's a Furyan through and through, always in search of something, bigger and badder than he is, to lock horns with.And all the while, Twohy and Diesel manage to retain that comic book style of Riddick's character, mixing the serious with the absurd and pulling it off quite successfully to make Riddick an original legend in his own right. One of the film's more memorable smaller scenes is where Riddick threatens to kill a prison inmate with his teacup and after that, threatens to kill his friend with the little opener key from a tin of corned beef.Dramatic, action packed, funny, awe inspiring, tense and unpredictable; if you can't appreciate The Chronicles of Riddick, may I suggest 'In The Night Garden' or something even simpler!?",The Chronicles of Riddick
122,udeaasykle,This movie is just as bad as Pitch Black,3,9 February 2005,"This is the sequel to Pitch Black starring the dark voiced muscle man Vin Diesel. Well, I really hoped they wouldn't make a sequel to Pitch Black. Not because it would ruin the movie, but because Pitch Black is a horrible movie which sucks. Well, so does this movie. Vin Diesel, playing Riddick, or Ridiculous as I would call his character is back to deliver cool one liners and crappy acting. Sounds familiar? Well it should because it looks like this is all he can do. If you watch this movie, you know what you are going to get. He is ultra cool, he gets in trouble, he is ultra cool, he handles it, and he is ultra cool. This is the entire movie. The only thing between him being cool and him being cool, is plot holes and bad acting jobs. But if you liked Pitch Black, you will like this as well. If you didn't like Pitch Black, stay away from this movie. Or watch it if you want to badmouth it like I am doing right now. I rate this movie 3/10",The Chronicles of Riddick
123,Asteri-Atypical,I'm glad I saw it for free...,3,10 June 2004,"When the screening to which we were invited for Riddick was over my friend and I looked at each other, shrugged and said ""eh - well, the effects were good so it was OK"".I don't believe either of us would have been happy if we'd actually had to PAY to go see it.  It was marginally worth the time we spent to go to the theatre and sit through it.The effects were good, however, as another commenter has noted, state of the art special effects are nothing special or unusual these days.Sadly, the most interesting elements of the plot were never fully explored. One gets a sense there was a lot of drama behind the scenes in this universe which we never got to see.  I found myself always wondering more about the cultures, races, history and worlds in the ""Riddick Universe"" than we even began to see.All in all, it's just another run-of-the-mill hi-action, good special effects film without a lot of substance.  I would have been a lot more impressed if such films weren't a dime a dozen in Hollywood these days.",The Chronicles of Riddick
124,themarina1,The likable Riddick comes back for a bittersweet round 2,7,3 August 2004,"SF fans may have seen this little film called Pitch Black a few years ago. For many, including me, this was our introduction to the soon to be very popular, Vin Diesel. Not only was Vin great as the hero, the story was very well done and a really great, enjoyable action flick. When I heard they were doing a 'sequel' I was curious.I wasn't too sure what to expect but the ads looked interesting. What a mistake that was. Although the story had potential to be a great movie, something was missing here. I can't quite put my finger on it but there seemed to be a very large missing piece to keep this movie together (maybe a better story line????). Though I wasn't expecting great acting, I was also not expecting the complete crap that we're made to sit through. Although I wanted it to be good, this movie is not something I can recommend and still feel good about. It's slow, poorly acted and all around sleeper.4/10",The Chronicles of Riddick
125,stumpmee77,Between The Chronicles of Riddick & Star Wars Episode II,9,11 January 2005,"I'll take Chronicles of Riddick in a heartbeat. Two things I saw annoying about this film is: 1) when the scene where the sun comes out on the planet where people can be fried but the eye candy and our hero lives--But I figure Riddick's protecting eye candy and he must come from a planet that the inhabitants can stand that sort of thing. I mean, the film doesn't exactly tell where Riddick's from so oh well. It makes me want to look at the first film which about 5 minutes was all I saw--But this film is one of those rare Sci-fi sagas where I didn't feel the need to see the other parts--I want to the first film. (Unlike ST:AOTC and TMP where I wish I had stuck with just IV, V & VI).The other thing that I got put out with was I couldn't understand anything Vin Disel said. I wanted to shout--""Subtiles, please someone subtitle this man!"" But beyond that, great FX, a storyline that had twists and surprises, the oiliest conniving courtier couple in the history of movies (please let them be in Riddick III) and eye-popping sets! I hope this film is remembered at Oscar time for the last and I eagerly await the next installment.",The Chronicles of Riddick
126,AirBourne_Bds,Fast & Furian,8,8 August 2004,"Truth be known, I have never really liked Diesel... Not in ""xXx,"" nor the stock thing with Ben Affleck, nor the ""Fast And The Furious,"" or whatever else he's done... UNTIL NOW! This Movie is a cross between ""Conan The Barbarian,"" and the onslaught of the Borg in Star Trek - The Next Generation (ST:NG) and there was no better person to show it's futile not to expect resistance than Vin Diesel! I never saw ""Pitch Black,"" but I heard it's good! I find this is a great picture to show you never ever surrender even when the knife is separating the epidermis and corpuscles are starting to trickle! His resistance to the Lord Marshall even in the face of death was magnificent and Thandie Newton was sublime as the villainous gold-digger...

This movies about it, the story is thin: Bad guys following a half-dead leader who can extend his soul from his body and then his body snaps to catch up, granting superhuman speed, and who is phrophesized to be killed by a Furian (Riddick). People will complain that the backgrounds aren't developed enough. Who were the other 5 Lord Marshals? What was up with the ""elemental"" race? Is the Underverse real? Who cares? It's why we watch this film. Has it got Action? YES! Cool bad guys? Yes. Beautiful women? Yes. Explosions? Yes. Good enough for me. Not looking for Art here, just fun.",The Chronicles of Riddick
128,Adorable,Riddick-ulous,5,12 August 2004,"Science fiction fanatics will be sorely heartbroken to realize one of the genre's least probable heroes, Riddick of Pitch Black fame, turns out to be the paper tiger one invariably expects him to be. The guy simply can't carry a movie, particularly if said film packs watered-down writing more fitting of a Sci Fi Channel production and action that never rises to the occasion.But what is the occasion? In a feat of despotic marriage between Stargate, Scorpion King and Battlefield Earth, Riddick returns as an ex-con renegade traversing human space in search of freedom and liberty from haunting memories. In an aptly executed opening sequence, Riddick (Vin Diesel) single-handedly dispatches mercs hot on his trail in an icy wasteland of a planet. Later, our venerable protagonist lands on Helion Prime, a bucolic bastion of human civilization about to receive the mother of all wake up calls courtesy of the Necromonger nation, a horde of star-vanquishing fascists on a Jihad-like crusade of power lust and death worship. When these characters show up, we get a passable invasion scene, with Religion Man (Keith David, who was also in Pitch Black) facing the enemy and paying for it through the nose. Consequently, Riddick's status as the last surviving Furian (the only ethnicity these Necromongers fear) forces him back into reluctant leader mode, as he heralds a motley crew of fighters in a bid to save the universe as Hollywood now knows it.Similar to what often occurs in these projects, the so-called menace presents little compulsion or fascination. The Necromongers soon fall flat on their faces, maybe because Colm Feore, who does their ludicrously monikered head of state, ""Lord Marshal"", wasn't really into proceedings with all his heart. And we can't fault him for it, since Chronicles seldom warrants any fuss at all. Riddick's anti-evil campaign brings him up against what supposedly amounts to the greatest threat ever, yet we only receive a scant few battle scenes (all bad), and sit down to behold a paltry anti-climax of gargantuan proportions. Sure, Karl Urban (Lord of the Rings series, Ghost Ship) and Thandie Newton (Mission: Impossible 2) as Necromonger higher-ups Lord and Dame Vaako carry about their scheming, treacherous business nicely enough, but can't make up for everybody else, including Judi Dench in a bewilderingly redundant role as Aereon, an ethereal creature whose purpose in the story we still haven't figured out.Riddick's adventures take him to a prison planet by the appealing name of Crematoria, where acute solar heat scorches planetary surfaces daily, leaving any organism exposed a sizzling cinder. Except for Riddick and company. They have the CGI department on their side, and can run around, pulling off all manner of silly stunts, blinding sun or not. On Crematoria, he hooks up with old pal-rival Kyra, who used to be teen Jack in Pitch Black. Having grown into quite the combative vixen, Kyra enlists with his cause and joins the merry old bandwagon. Together they move on to defeating the Necromonger parade, and realize life's penchant for ultimate irony: once the dust settles and the nefarious Lord Marshal's slain, Riddick finds himself sitting on his now defunct enemy's throne, involuntarily ascending to the headaches and trappings of statesmanship. Remember how Conan the Destroyer ended? Same deal.Chronicles would have made for an excellent Farscape episode or maybe some high-caliber miniseries, but as a feature release it simply doesn't have anything to recommend it or set it apart from a whole catalog of abysmally inadequate attempts at capturing people's imaginations and wallets. Samey effects, generic computer graphics and absolutely no epic dimensions at all leave Riddick wanting, and us wondering how the hell he ended up a franchise.Rating: * *",The Chronicles of Riddick
129,evan_harvey,A neat film,9,1 November 2005,"I thought Riddick: Chronicles was a great film in terms of action, a reasonably okay story-line, good characters, cool special effects, great scenes and a decent ending. Definitely worth a sequel.I thought Pitch Black kinda sucked- good idea, badly executed. I went into Riddick expecting it to be a bit cruddy, but I was throughly surprised and pleased by the film.The story line was neat, reasonable depth. I wish they'd explored the Underverse concept a bit more, as that was a neat idea. Not the most fleshed-out story, but a solid one.A good baddie (the Lord Marshall), the other Necromonger commander was good, Riddick was a great character, Jack/Kyra was good, Toombs was good.Nice pace to the film. Obviously it wasn't a perfect film - some gaps in the story in terms of he's in one place, and then just shows up in another with no intervening scenes (happens twice). No real beginning, just kinda slaps the story down and off it goes. Reminiscent of Conan a bit.I don't know why this didn't do better at the cinema. I would have paid to see it and felt I got value for money. 9 out of 10 for enjoyment value.",The Chronicles of Riddick
130,das417,"Mixed feelings, even now",7,31 January 2005,"I still find myself doubting what I should say about The Chronicle of Riddick. What should I focus on the most? What was it I really liked, and what was it I didn't like? Odd, but I have a hard time describing my feelings.The first thing I enjoyed the most was the scenery and the beauty of the various worlds, uniforms, and ships. The colors and the beauty of the movie in terms of sets, CGI, and even color scheme is impressive. I suppose this is the aspect of the movie that stands out the most more then anything else. Though everything tended to be either really colorful or computer animated, much of the movie didn't feel like a cartoon, such as the latest Star Wars and it's usage of CGI.However the problems, or the confusion I should say I have about this movie, starts once one get's past the nice colors and planets. The mere fact that something known as the ""Underverse"" is the main goal of the Necromongers doesn't say much. The ""Underverse""? I laughed the first couple of times when I heard it. There wasn't a better name to be had then the ""Underverse""? I compare Riddick to Blade because it seems that both characters are the same concept. A good, tough ""bad"" guy whose willing to do what is right though they could care less how they do it and the affect it has on those around them. However, unlike Blade, Riddick comes off as more of a thug then a warrior per se. I suppose that is what he's supposed to be in the end, but then again I don't see simple thug as being able to have the ability to save all of man.... I guess that's the point though.The plot itself was good and I did enjoy the idea of a great army destroying all of man for some great spiritual purpose. Honestly, I have to say I was amused and if that's the case then it was somewhat of a good movie. Not great, however it's worth watching once.",The Chronicles of Riddick
131,toll-8,The Chronicles Of Riddick,6,11 November 2007,"I was surprised that I actually enjoyed this movie. Not being a big fan of Pitch Black I thought this movie wouldn't take my fancy but I have to say I was wrong. It was a very enjoyable movie with Vin Diesel playing his part extremely well. He is so believable as the bad good guy and I really believed he was a killer (maybe it just his voice!!!!) This is certainly not the best movie in my DVD cabinet but was better than I gave it credit for. Thandie Newton is a little disappointing tho I feel, and think she could have played her part a bit less ...............boring. The plot is completely far fetched which makes it even better but the ending sort of just finished and wished they had explained what happened to Riddick after they took him as their leader. Bring on the 3rd one. WATCH THIS MOVIE........you will be pleasantly surprised.",The Chronicles of Riddick
132,JimD73,Chronicles of Riddick has a very specific audience and it doesn't try to hide it,5,4 February 2005,"Let me just say I never saw Pitch Black. I intended to, but I never did. I never intended to see this, but I did. Funny world, huh? There was nothing else to rent and I was home alone for the night, so this one won. I'm by no means a fan of Vin Diesel. The Fast & The Furious sucked. XXX was probably made by someone who lost a bet. I really didn't bother after that. So does Chronicles of Riddick follow the same pattern?Plot: 1.3/2.5: OK, this is one of those weird sci-fi movies that about three people in the world can follow. Kinda like watching Dune all over again, if you catch my drift. I'll do my best, though. It's five years after Pitch Black. Riddick (Diesel) is a wanted convict. When he finds out a former friend whom he saved in the Pitch Black incident, holy man Imam (David), ratted him out, he goes to find out what happened. He learns that Imam was threatened or something, I still don't know and don't care enough to rewind to find out. Anyway, Riddick finds out that an empire known as the Necromanger are trying to convert all the other people in the universe to their way of living and kill those who refuse. They are lead by the Lord Marshall (Feore), but Necromanger warrior Vaako (Urban) and his wife Dame Vaako (Newton) are conspiring to overthrow Lord Marshall. After a raid, Riddick is taken prisoner by the Necromanger. Of course, he escapes. Due to some wacko prophecy, Riddick is a top priority to the Necromanger and they set out to find him. The plot is filled with all that sci-fi mumbo-jumbo half the people on Earth hate. The first half is very tough to follow and really just sucks, but the second half advances quite well. Despite the mumbo-jumbo, prophecy, soul-sucking crap, The Chronicles of Riddick does have a decent plot, considering the genre.Action: 1/2.5: The ending has some very well done action scenes. The ones in the beginning are terrible, though. The action scenes at first are just a series of flashing lights. People like to think the whole lights-on-lights-off thing works, but it makes the action scenes too jumpy to be good. The last couple action scenes are very well done and get the old blood pumping, so I can't complain too much.Acting: 1.8/2.5: I find this type of movie hard to judge the acting. Everyone is too weird to really be sure if they all just suck as actors. Regardless, I liked Vin Diesel as Riddick. It's a shock, but he is a good Riddick. Dench seems completely out of place in a role that could have been left completely on the cutting room floor. The rest of the acting is pretty good. I did like Karl Urban here though, who we last saw in The Lord of the Rings.Entertainment: 1.2/2.5: The Chronicles of Riddick is for a very specific audience and it doesn't try to hide it. I'm not the biggest fan of the genre, but I commend them for not being a Hollywood whore and going to the biggest audience. If you like movies like Dune or Star Trek, than this is your type of movie. If not, stay the hell away. I'm more against than for, but there are certain pluses to the genre, and Chronicles of Riddick gets the genre right.Total: 53%: Basically, if you liked Dune and Star Trek, you'll get a kick out of this. IF you don't like sci-fi, you won't like this. It's as simple as that. I found it watchable, nowhere near the worst movie of the year. The first bit actually had me thinking of giving this a zero, so you can see that it does improve as it goes on. If you like this kind of thing, this is like Christmas for you.",The Chronicles of Riddick
133,SimonHeide,Strangely entertaining.,6,14 January 2008,"I honestly cant say that this movie is a good movie but none the less I was entertained by it. First of all I am not even sure that you can say that Vin Diesel is acting. He is without expression all the way through so I never even got close to answer the question: who is he (on a psychological level)? I didn't quite understand the movie's premise that sometimes ""you have to fight evil with evil"" as I didn't see him as evil but more as a self-centered guy who still for instance chose to live on an ice-planet for many years to protect Kyra.The style (or fashion) of the necromongers was odd and made me think of some old episode of ""Star Trek next generation"". Btw, don't you think that the necromongers are similar to the ""resistence is futile"" Borgs? As far as the characters goes I enjoyed many of the the supporting actors. The Mecs, Judy Dench and the convicts. It is weird that so many of them out-acts Vin Diesel by far.Well, if you are in the mood for some sci-fi action with some really nice special effects (especially from the planet Crematoria) and some good performances mainly from the supporting actors then watch this movie but be prepared that this is cinematic junk-food.Regards SimonPs.

Diesal's character is has a smug attitude that sometimes makes it difficult to root for him. He does have an intimidating pressance that makes the bad guys miss, or perhaps they are all just bad shots.The special effects are not high tech but they seem good for what they are.

Well, maybe these people should be introduced to something more their speed...like Earnest goes to Camp.Having never read any of the books, but having had the advantage of seeing Pitch Black before hand, I easily followed everything in this movie and enjoyed every second of it.There is not a single moment of bad acting, every actor plays their part to perfection. The budget and effects allowed for a complete suspension of disbelief they were so well done.Unlike many scifi movies, every ounce of effects were required in this movie because the movie takes you to places and shows you things that require the effects. Without them, this movie would just be a play.There are just not that many epic scifi movies. Star Trek is pretty formulaic, Star Wars is as close as you can get to epic for science fiction. There are lots of great scifi movies, but nothing epic. I think tCoR is just about as close as you will get.If you have the IQ to be a scifi fan, you're going to love this movie. If, however, you don't have the imagination to be a lover of scifi but occasionally enjoy watching one, go watch something less complex. We wouldn't want to confuse you.

From what I gathered, The Chronicles of Riddick could be considered a decent film from a different opinion, but in my opinion I wasn't a fan hence why I rated it lower, not necessarily a bad film it just didn't float my boat in any way. An exhibition of elaborate set designs and headache inducing special effects, this is proper Sci-Fi, I just wish I could've understood it. The Chronicles of Riddick is the sequel to (the much better) Pitch Black, that was a film I enjoyed and actually could follow, and Vin Diesel was fantastic in creating the allure and mystique that surrounds the titular character, Richard Riddick; yet in this film, the mystique and coolness was sadly replaced by confusion.Unusual for one of my reviews but I really can't elaborate on the story or the plot, because somewhere along the viewing I got lost and couldn't find the thread to get back into it, but, that's the point, it's a confusing film so I will base my review on that very point..., if you can watch The Chronicles of Riddick and understand it, well you must be a smarter guy than I.",The Chronicles of Riddick
137,Colbridge,Twohy tries to create a mythological fantasy world but it fails to fully engage,5,10 June 2021,"To say this movie is overblown is an understatement. I concluded in my Pitch Black review, the first instalment in the Riddick franchise, that the film was too narrow and lacked ambition. Well writer/director David Twohy goes completely the other way here and if anything is overly ambitious which tends to hamper the project.Vin Diesel is still watchable as Riddick and earns his action hero chops but the script doesn't allow for any scope to flesh out his character and this is the heart of the problem for all the characters. Twohy tries to create a mythological fantasy world, borrowing from the Roman Empire and Egyptology, and the huge budget allows for this with stylish visuals and impressive CGI laden effects, but it fails to fully engage and at times just confuses the audience due to a lack of exposition. We should really be rooting for our anti-hero Richard Riddick to single handedly defeat the evil Necromongers, especially during some of the action set pieces, but we're not.Twohy has consciously decided to change tack with the sequel in an attempt to freshen things up but it backfires and soon becomes dull and tiresome. It almost felt that he was trying to capitalise on the recent success of films like Stephen Sommer's The Mummy films but didn't have a clear enough idea of the world he had created in order to take the audience with him.",The Chronicles of Riddick
138,d_art,Riddick-ulous...oops somebody already said this.,1,13 June 2004,"Just saw ""Chronicles of Riddick.""  To add, I should warn that I have not seen ""Pitch Black"" (at least not all of it) so my opinion of this movie might be somewhat tainted (esp. if there were any inside jokes I should've gotten).  As it stands, I found the movie quite generic.  The sets are rather interesting-looking (despite the overabundance of CG effects all over the place), yet all the characters inside it, for the most part, felt pretty flat--generally not very memorable.  If the characters were compared to a soft-drink, I'd consider them as lukewarm stale-Coke (minus the caffeine). Even Vin Diesel's Riddick character seemed monotonous (I don't mean his voice necessarily, but hey, that could be another point) for most of the picture.  The plot doesn't go very far beyond the usual set up, so I hoped the movie would (hopefully) shine in the action department.  Not really. There was probably more action done by the shakey cameraman than the actor. In fact, the fight  scenes might not even have been fight scenes.  It's shakey, heavily choppy, and every angle feels a split second long.  It also didn't help that they were super close-ups (the TV format will have a field day on this one).  The movie also has tons of computer graphics (with supposed ""action"") which sometimes have a tendency to make me doze off (a feeling I haven't had since watching the CG-filled ""Mummy Returns""). Overall, this movie might qualify as a rental (I personally wouldn't rent it, though, but that's just my opinion).",The Chronicles of Riddick
139,Space_Lord,Diesel power!,5,25 May 2005,"My flatmate absolutely looooves Vin Diesel. She thinks he's hotter than something that's really hot. I can't agree. I can't stand the Diesel man. I don't know why, but I can't. The only movie I enjoy of his is Pitch Black, which I think was underrated when it was released, possibly because it was science fiction. So when she brought this home from the local, I was willing to give it a shot. And my opinion of the film is that it's average. No doubt, it's visually stunning and the concept is fair: a warmongering race that aims to kill or convert all life in the universe. There are some good action sequences too, but ultimately it fails to deliver the suspense and feeling of dread that Pitch Black does. It's unfair to compare the two, really, as they are as far removed as could possibly be on so many levels. The only thing the two films share is the main character and his sidekick. A reasonable effort, and you could do worse than this to kill time.",The Chronicles of Riddick
140,winopaul,"OK, for a popcorn flick",5,18 May 2015,"I loved the guy who said this has a great plot. The detailed plot summary: Run, hide, fight, run, hide, fight, fight, run, captured. Fight, run, fight, hide, fight, sunburn, run, hide, fight, hide, sunburn, parlay. Sneak, hide, fight, hide, fight, fight, fight, sad, rule the universe.The truly outstanding thing about this movie were the fluff babes. There was fluff babe high-tone that combined sweet innocence and teen prostitute in ways I am still grappling with. I like her. A lot. Double points for looking to be a woman of color in what is apparently a white people everywhere movie. Then there was fluff babe dutiful wife, who would also be someone you would like to not only get busy with, but hang around for years and years, despite her annoying pre-fluff babe precocious spawn child. The fluff babe tomboy 1 was great in the ship, not sure when she got written out. Finally, fluff babe tomboy 2 combined the best of fluff-babe high-tone with fluff babe tomboy 1 to be really desirable as fluff babe convict. Whoever cast these women should get an Oscar. I love them all.I did have problems making sense of many plot elements. Like when gray guys attack the other gray guys, except then there is a big zappo, and a third batch of gray guys walks in. Who the heck is who? Can't we give one side red hair or maybe even use colors for the different uniforms? Another confusion was between fluff babe tomboy 1/crewman and fluff babe tomboy 2/convict. I am pretty sure they were two different people, I mean, why would they clap the fluff babe tomboy 1 in irons? It would have helped if they made it more clear when the first one died or stumbled off into the sunburn. Maybe she wanted more than SAG minimum so they just stopped filming her one day. It gets back to the previous problem, that the art director thought that every single thing should be gray. Is the future universe a big Portland cement plant? I actually like Vin, who is competent despite the slaggers giving him guff. He has a great voice, he can act well, he is physically fit, and while not exactly whupped with the ugly stick, he is no Hollywood airhead beauty either. What I hate is when they give him cringe-worthy lines like ""I haven't smelled beautiful in a long time."" Is sounds like some has-been white guy come-on line in a dance club and it is very off-putting. Maybe its Vin trying to be Schwarzenegger, or maybe it is the writers. Leave the cutesy comments to Arnold, and just play it straight, it would have been 100 times better.They spent a lot of money on special effects. Some are Battlestar Galactica quality, but most are pretty good. This is 11 years old now, and the effects do look dated. Fights and explosions will not carry a film, so that was money wasted. In my book, this was a flop. It had a big budget and barely broke even with its worldwide revenue much less its domestic box office.So, a star for Vin, I really do like him, a star for the effects, and three stars for the women. Unlike Total Recall, this film did not do bad because it's plot was complicated. It did bad because its plot was silly. It ended begging for yet another sequel. Let's hope they don't make one.",The Chronicles of Riddick
141,jimorris,Special effects do not a scifi movie make...,3,4 June 2004,"""The Chronicles of Riddick"" is an overblown empty scifi epic. The acting is atrocious, the weapons are ludicrous, the plot is simply stupid, and the music instead of being in the background is in the foreground. The special effects are excellent BUT that does not make a movie. Thandie Newton gets to wear some stunning costumes and hairdos; Alexa Davalos tried to imitate Sigourney Weaver in the Alien series; Judi Dench has the look of ""what the hell am I doing here"".

Within minutes of the movie starting I become thoroughly immersed in the great story and couldn't help but get right into it. It had great effects, heaps of action, the locations were totally believable and the cast did an fantastic job. Vin Diesel was as wooden as ever but the rest of the cast were good, especially Dame Judi Dench, who gave some credibility to the film. THe only thing I disliked was that nothing ever seems to go right for Riddick and I hope that this might change in a third installment. I prefer science-fiction like this over Star Wars type films as they have less fiction and more science.

143,mrspasm,Quite good!,7,3 September 2009,"Once on upon a time, there was a young boy called Rodger. He lived in Outer Spac, on a planet called Qwop 127. One day a ship full of bad guys came and killed all the adults and abducted the children. Rodger and his friends were taken away and trained to be killers or else they would be killed. As time went on, most of the kids got older, became renegades, mercenaries, cold blooded killers and criminals, and forget where they came from. Rodger was the toughest of them all, but he never forgot. As Rodger was the name of a fool, he changed his name to Riddick a name meaning 'The man who will get rid of all d*cks'. He made it his quest to kill his captors. Of course many years had passed and most of his captors had gone on to become family men, rich business men, and politicians. He killed them all one by one which turned him into public enemy number one. Every cop in the galaxy was after him, and soon he was arrested and imprisoned. However, fortune was to shine on him: whilst being transported on a ship to another prison planet his ship crashed. They landed on an abandoned planet, just him and a few other criminals and cops. They soon discovered the planet was full of zombies and most were killed. Riddick escaped only to be captured once more. This film depicts the latest chapter of the Chronicles: his latest escape and some sort of mission to kill a pile of bad guys.This proves that modern books are better than all that old Shakespeare stuff like The Chronicles Of Narneo. Those books were written by boring old wrinkly people and were filled with stupid stuff like romance, but didn't have any excitements or action set pieces. This story is filled with killings, chases, and fights without even the slightest hint of romance. Van Diesel plays Rodger again, his rippling chest and muscular arms perfect for the role. There are plenty of other actors, but most are just there to die. Unfortunately there is more talking in this film than the first, and no monsters. I assume this is a middle chapter leading up to the final part where Riddick gets together a gang of marines to return to the planet and wipe out all the monsters from the first film. That would be cool as no-one has done a film like that before! The end.Best Scene: When Riddick is being chased by the ultra hot sunlight and he has to swing from vine to vine in the jungle like Hercules so he can escape. He makes it to safety but drops his sunglasses as the light is only feet away. He reaches out, snaps them just as the ground burns. He quips as he puts them- 'Toasty!'",The Chronicles of Riddick
144,MVictorPjinsiste,Decent Gothic Sci-Fi,6,29 January 2020,"This movie's got a flavour like few sci-fi flicks have, with its Coranic cities on green seas, its savage prison moons or its gothic halls. The sets are quite elaborate, and the ""un-finished"" texture of that age's CGI marries itself well with the Necromonger style, their fusion making it come off as sleek and stark. The music complement the atmosphere well, creating a pleasant experience.The acting is an okay thing, most of the actors being credible with a couple of solid performences here, notably from Newton and Chinlund but, alas, the main character's a problem; Monosyllabic, selfish, aloof, omniscient and invincible, he's quite hard to like and it isn't because he's a shade of grey - but rather because he's coming off like a Marty Stu of some sort. His pick-up lines are especially terrible, and yet he's sometimes despicted as a womanizer, which I think is jarring. Otherwise, Diesel does give a great physical performence here, as is Davalos.This movie is the one Riddick film that sets the tone of the universe they're set in, the other ones being more focused on survival, and it does it well. If one can live with some of the problems I had with the main character, he's in for a good gothic sci-fi time.",The Chronicles of Riddick
145,slimecity-38663,I really like this movie.,7,7 July 2019,"I am a dead keen good scifi fan and I love this movie. Of course its a bit bloated, bombastic, and it has vin diesel in it (you can almost hear him saying to the director ""film my jumping over this while i flex like crazy....). However it has some great actors in it - Judi Dench (?!), Tandi Newton, Colm Feore, Linus Roache, and NZ's own Karl Urban. But the great thing about this movie, is that its not afraid to take on a big subject - a race of inter-planetary ""World Eaters"", who, if they cannot convert you, will kill you. The effects are utterly superb - the sunrise on the planet Crematoria is a highlight, and is the bad guys invasion on Helion Prime. What I really love about this movie is the risks taken with the technology - which I havent seen in any other scifi - the ""ion trails"" left be slowly rotating space-craft, the ""lensers"" used by the bad guys to find people, the fact that craft use craft radiating black swirls of ant-matter to hover and move around, the bad guys flying citadels, the bad guy leader's powers (after he has seen the under-verse), and the way that soldiers are teleported to a planets surface. Great care has been taken with the tech, as well as the whole background and story of this universe. Quite frankly, this film is sadly underrated, and far more interesting that its quite sparse and one-note prequel and sequel.",The Chronicles of Riddick
146,rbsjrx,This time it's as bad as they say,4,13 June 2004,"I learned long ago that life could be very dreary indeed if I didn't cut summer blockbuster movies some slack. Summer is the season of mindless entertainment, so judge the films accordingly. Sure, it's nice to see a summer movie with some depth, but it's also not realistic to expect Shakespeare in the park.So far, this summer, I've generally bucked the critics. I had fun with ""Van Helsing"" and enjoyed ""The Day After Tomorrow"". I mostly agreed with them on ""Shrek 2"". But now comes ""The Chronicles of Riddick"". I was never that much of a fan of ""Pitch Black"", but ""XXX"" did OK in the mindless entertainment department, so I had some hopes for this.I was wrong!First the good news... I was so proud of myself for being one of only a handful of folks in the theater that actually could follow what passed for a plot. The bad news was that even understanding it didn't help.While the CGI FX are up to current standards, the story is a mess. The writers (I assume it had writers) took the ""let's throw everything against the wall and see what sticks"" approach to storytelling. Worse yet, from my perspective, it attempted to integrate religion with SF. This is a tricky thing to pull off and very few shows do it successfully. (For an example of a show that did a good job of it, buy at least the first four seasons of ""Babylon 5"" on DVD.)[WARNING: Minor spoilers ahead!]Worst of all, it committed the same flaw that undoubtedly contributed to bad word of mouth for ""Van Helsing"" - it had a real downer at the end. Given the way movies are made these days, I have to assume that at least two alternate endings were actually shot for test audiences. If the makers of ""Riddick"" were clever, even if they favored the current ending, they would have learned a quick lesson from reviews and exit polls of the ""Van Helsing"" audiences. Had they done so, they would have done some quick surgery to provide a more upbeat ending.All in all, very disappointing. I rated it a 4 for some good visuals and interesting FX. Otherwise, it would be no higher than a 2. OTOH, they could have skimmed off 10% of the FX budget and put it into a better story and writing and gotten much, much higher.",The Chronicles of Riddick
147,ChrisTreborn,Never See This Boring Epic,2,29 December 2004,"After some Serious thoughts I got the answer why Diesel did this movie. He did this movie only for his own COOPERATE purpose. Founded by Vin himself in 2002, Tigon Studios is a game production company that will develop original games as well as be actively involved in the development process of video games based on motion pictures featuring Vin Diesel as the lead actor. For some stupid Gaming Reason he produced this cinematic crap from the original sci-fi 2000 movie Pitch Black.The Original was a Great movie compared to this Sequel/Spin-off! Why? Well, Producer Diesel & writer/director David Twohy spoiled all that tone and environment with new Storyline backgrounds. The Chronicles of Riddick aka Pitch Black 2 (Spoilers******)Based on characters created by Jim & Ken Wheat, writer/director David Twohy marks new chapter to the cult anti-hero. Their only motive - Don't go back to the same planet, don't meet the same creatures and don't even let it be a creature movie. So here is the metamorphosis.Planet after planet is falling to an unholy army of Necromongers -- conquering warriors who offer ravaged worlds a simple choice -- convert or die. Those who refuse their rule hope in vain for someone or something that will slow the spread of Necromongers. But rebels are short-lived and saviors, its seems, are in short supply.When things get bad, weary survivors turn to myths for comfort. Sometimes the only way to stop evil is not with good -- but with another kind of evil. An oracle told Lord Marshal (Colm Feore), leader of the aptly named ""Necromongers,"" that he would meet his doom at the hands of someone from Riddick's (Vin Diesel) race, the Furions. In an effort to escape this fate, Lord Marshal destroys the entire Furion race. By making this movie with new challenges, an ensemble setting, reduced this into a Crap. What I expect is not what I got. Even though with all this mess it could have been a good movie, if they should have given a better musical score. Graeme Revell's background score make this film boring suck.It was Supposed to be a SCI-FI sequel, but adding so much MYTHICAL Soap OPERA TONE, transformed it into a PATHETIC FORGETTABLE Movie.I rate this 2 out 10",The Chronicles of Riddick

Dozens of local tough youths had shown up on this day, eager to get their dose of orchestrated violence and mayhem. No one sitting there was prepared for what was to transpire.Here is the plot in a nutshell: Riddick, reprising his Pitch Black role (an often-talked about movie, yet nobody I know has seen it) as a criminal-type who can see in the dark. And there are these other characters, these invading types who want to ""convert"" people and are looking for the underverse (I like how the chief bad guy kept saying ""the uuuuuuuuuunderverse"" in his clipped, classically trained voice). What do they want to convert people to? The gay lifestyle! Check out the guy who played the purifier character. He's a hoot and an absolute sissy.Anyway, some judeo-Christian and a good dose of vampires thrown together equals a prophecy about a last of his kind who has to do... something.

149,Surecure,This is what the Star Wars prequels wish they could be,8,29 March 2005,"It is presently hard to talk about Space-Operas without bringing up the present benchmark of Star Wars. However, The Chronicles of Riddick serves to up the ante on what the present Star Wars trilogy is attempting to achieve by doing something significantly different. In truth, Chronicles owes much more to Frank Herbert's Dune than to Star Wars, and in this manner it tends to step beyond late science-fiction/action works.Chronicles is not a picture perfect science fiction film. Make no mistake: this is popcorn movie-making not deeply philosophical expeditions the way that Blade Runner, 2001 or Solaris is. But as popcorn films go, this is a keeper. Filled with exciting action sequences, richly drawn characters and special effects that will blow any movie-goer away, Riddick is perfect pure entertainment fare.When Pitch Black first arrived on the scene, Roger Ebert (who was not a big fan of Pitch Black) stated that it was clearly evident that Vin Diesel was going to be the next big action star. If nothing else, Chronicles of Riddick proves this beyond a reasonable doubt. Diesel has an on-screen presence that captivates the viewers. His physical and vocal presence commands attention, and this helps to lend a credibility to his portrayal of the bad as nails Riddick that few could bring.David Twohy further demonstrates his masterful eye in his visual realization of the many worlds of Chronicles of Riddick. For whatever the story lacks, Twohy is able to fill in the space with a cinematic style all his own, adding what amounts to a character in his camera work.As a film not designed to be over-analyzed for subtle characterizations and deep meaning, The Chronicles of Riddick is the perfect snack for an entertainment hunger.",The Chronicles of Riddick

So it is with clear mind that I make this claim. I can truly say that this is perhaps the movie that I have felt the most indifferent about. Since I hadn't seen its predecessor I felt myself comparing this movie to a bizarre sci-fi Van Helsing, only Riddick took itself much more seriously which was part of the problem. This was seen in the casting of Judi Dench as the Elemental. Don't get me wrong, I think that Judi Dench is a great actress but I think that where Van Helsing knew that it had a flimsy script and so ( partially ) covered it up with campy OTT performances, Riddick tries to make a dark brooding atmosphere and only gets halfway there. Having said all this, I must admit that the action sequences were good and Vin Diesel did his best with an unwieldy script. Overall Riddick could have been a much better action flick if it had just stopped trying to look tough and instead been prepared to laugh at itself. Instead it left me with no real lasting memories.",The Chronicles of Riddick

It started well: building on the characters of the original film who escaped with Riddick, and I loved the prison break on the maximum security prison world (although it did feel like the writers just reversed Pitch Black, a world where you're in danger in the shadows, now a world where you're in danger in the light).But then they ruin it with Necromongers, a universal army which go world to world destroying everything and turning thier inhabitants into whatever they are.

153,Scorching,Disappointment,6,20 June 2004,"I did not know what to expect coming into the movie The Chronicles of Riddick which is sequel to Pitch Black. I haven't seen its predecessor and I have had limited exposure to it's trailers or previews. Pretty much a clean slate as the first few scenes rolled into screen. As per experience that sometimes is a good thing as I do not have any expectations to fill. 	 I wasn't that impressed with the action sequences of the film. They were rather ordinary and I have seen most of them before. I thought the story wasn't that good. Pretty much run of the mill stuff. More of really a story fit into an action scene when it should have been the other way around. I also felt that there were some parts of the film that were not necessary in the film especially in the prison planet and should have instead been spent more on Riddick's conflict with the Necromongers.     
Just like in any high budget movies these days huge amount of money are used in special effects. Well I got to say that those Computer effects really looked like just that effects made by a computer. There was little realism in the effects especially the landscapes. I however quite liked some of the ornate props they had in the movie. Those intricate looking, non SFX sets were good. I never really like Vin Diesel as an actor; he's more of an action star than an actor. Pretty much the same thing for this movie. Of course there was Judi Dench's Shakespeare in Love type of cameo which felt weird. Dame Judi Dench in a Sci-fi movie that's something you don't see everyday.",The Chronicles of Riddick
154,paulnewman2001,Big dumb overblown fun,6,23 December 2004,"Like so many other Hollywood directors before him, it seems poverty rather than success was a better inspiration for David Twoey.In 1999's Pitch Black, he took a modest budget and delivered a kick-ass sci-fi adventure about a wrecked spaceship's passengers stranded on a desert planet swarming with voracious predators  and in the process made an action star of gravel-voiced lummox Vin Diesel as the convict anti-hero Riddick.Now he's got a budget the size of a small South American country's GDP and figures what we really want is grandiose space opera.Opening a few years after the events of Pitch Black, Riddick's still got a price on his head but this time has the Necromongers on his tail, a horde of pasty Goths slaughtering their way to something called the Underverse.Apparently, their destructive quest is inspired by their leader's fear of a prophecy that he'll die at the hands of a Furian  and, wouldn't you know it, Riddick happens to be the last of 'em.So bounty hunters snag him for the Necromongers and he ends up on the prison planet Crematoria where temperatures vary between warm in the shade and 1,000 degrees C (and the less said about the ludicrous physics of a scene in which he and fellow fugitives outrun the sun during their inevitable escape, the better).The Necros finally catch up with Riddick but rather sportingly decide to risk everything by fighting their nemesis one-on-one, watched by Judi Dench who flits annoyingly about throughout the entire film as a mystic Elemental.Chronicles ... does boast some ravishing production design, the effects are solid without being original and the scraps are competently athletic.On the downside, it suffers from many of the fatal weaknesses of space operas  great gobs of plot, cod-history and preposterous names falling implausibly from the mouths of characters, a prepubescent male's wish fulfilment plot treated with po-faced gravity and, worst of all, an allegedly mercenary hardnosed anti-hero who can't seem to stop making fatuous quips and revealing flashes of his gooey inner child at every opportunity to do a good turn.Leave your brain in the airlock and there's undemanding fun to be had.",The Chronicles of Riddick
155,Mr_Mirage,Less Star Wars and more Conan,8,26 June 2004,"Riddick, he of the silvered irises, has been one of my favorite anti-heroes from the first glimpse of his badness in Pitch Black. There, he was shown to be Evil, Mean, Wicked, Bad and Nasty. This man is a survivor, first and foremost. Now, in the Chronicles, he comes to us again, unchanged, a brutal brawler with a swift calculating mind, forced into the battle circle with a race of zealous madmen and madwomen. And, of course... this time, it's personal...Many have babbled on incessantly in comparing this movie to Star Wars, which I find highly entertaining. First of all, Star Wars is a film for children, which is a good thing. The series (with some unfortunate moments) is good family entertainment.Pitch Black, and this, the huge sprawling beginning of the Chronicles of Riddick, is more of a Conan style saga. Riddick is no sage, no ""hero"" in the Skywalker sense, and anyone that is looking for that kind of story is going to be disappointed. He is a brawler, a Houdini, a man that has learned to think while in motion. He has no outside ""force"" to tap into: he is a force unto himself. His story fits neatly into the collective subconscious, but not as a hero with a thousand faces. He is a soldier, a fighter, and a man who simply wishes to be left alone. (I know because he says so!) Riddick is no fool, though, either. Watch Pitch Black again, watch the Chronicles, and see him as the brilliant battlefield strategist that he is. When on Crematoria (more on the names later), and a series of heartless and ruthless guards bail on their charges, Riddick quietly explains their plan. When asked how he could possibly know, not having been in the room at the time, Riddick states simply that it was the same plan he had.He knows when to be bold and attack, when to openly declare his assault and when to hold back and bide his time. He knows when to stride down the street, when to stay to the shadows and when to run for his life.
The names in the film are my primary gripe. Helion Prime is pretty cool, and I can live with it, but the Furions? Necromongers? Crematoria?

But much like Pitch Black, it's predecessor, I was surprised by the ending, the story, and the characters. I went with friends who were prepared to laugh the entire movie and ended up cheering by the end. There is a lot of action here - lots of wrestling moves and impossible stunts, but because it is pure fantasy, it actually works. Vin Diesel wins me over again as Riddick. He looks and sounds great, and plays a great anti-superhero. The special effects aren't the best and are made-for-TV quality, BUT are so visually unique that I actually enjoyed them. I only wish that Judi Dench would have played a bigger role - her acting is so first class and I really enjoyed her character, Aereon. While I am a big fan of Thandie Newton, I was disappointed in her conniving character. I felt they stole her whole persona from Dune. Of course, if you haven't seen or read Dune than that shouldn't bother you. The best part? A great ending! That is what really sold the movie for me.

I got this movie in a box of DVD's that a friend sold me. I finally got bored and watched one day. Within the first 5 minutes, I was interested. As the movie went on, I became more and more intrigued. I don't recall being bored for one second, whereas most movies in this genre are silly nonsense, drawn out with too much dialogue and unbearably boring scenes just to fill gaps in a poorly written script. The Chronicles of Riddick is a thoroughly.entertaining movie from start to finish. It's packed with action, quality fight scenes, with CGI used in an very intelligent way. I also am impressed with the acting of Vin Diesel. It's easy to tell this was a passionately produced movie. A great balance of action and plot. I would recommend this movie to anyone that likes action movies.",The Chronicles of Riddick
158,Nominahorn,Why aren't more movies like this one made?,9,11 December 2004,"Chronicles of Riddick is an epic science fiction adventure along the lines of Star Wars or Battletech. The amazing special effects manage to give you an impression of how huge the universe is without stealing the show themselves. The only shame is that we only get to see a small part of this grand universe.Riddick is played in typical bad-a** style by Vin Diesel, and his one-liners make the movie worth watching all by themselves. He is supported by a talented mix of known and unknown actors who, despite having to share screen time between so many different characters, manage to develop their own characters very nicely. I especially like the merc captain Toombs, and the Elemental Aereon.If you want action this movie is packed full, but it also doesn't allow the action to get in the way of or take over the compelling storyline. The action itself is usually very good, although the fast-cutting distorted camera angles did give me a headache sometimes. The ""good guys"" (nobody is really ""good"" in this movie)are all kick-a**, and they definitely make you root for them and almost feel sorry for anybody who gets in their way, especially people who mess with Riddick.If you were looking for another thriller like Pitch Black then you probably did not like this movie. I watched Riddick first and then went and watched Pitch Black and I think that is probably the better way to do it. Both are great films, but they also cannot be compared with each other, as Pitch Black is a small-time thriller and Chronicles of Riddick is a sci-fi epic.Another objection that people have to this movie is that we don't see enough of the characters and that they are not developed properly, but the only way to do that would have been to do a Lord of the Rings-style 3 1/2 hour movie, which is clearly out of the question. I say just enjoy the characters as they are, especially Diesel's Riddick, and you find that this is probably the best film to have come out this year, and maybe even the best sci-fi epic since the original Star Wars trilogy.If you are a sci-fi fan, especially a fan of Battletech books, Star Wars movies, Starcraft games, etc., you should love this movie. I know I am and I did.9/10 stars.",The Chronicles of Riddick

160,tom-darwin,The Chronicles of Rubbish,2,11 April 2006,"With ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Pitch Black,"" Vin Diesel was on trajectory to be the Gen-X John Wayne, if not Marlon Brando. Since then he has been making Schwarzenegger look like Von Sydow. ""Chronicles"" inexplicably turns from the spare story of survival in ""Pitch Black"" to a sweeping saga of highbrow, decaying and rather sissy civilizations. Hence the pompous title (coming up: Stallone in ""The Chronicles of Rambo""). Actors with pompous reputations lend pompous support, including Dench as the Ghost of Bummers Yet to Come, or Old, Wispy Cassandra, I forget which. If an actress MUST be a puff of smoke, why not a nude Halle Berry or Rebecca Romijn with strategic wisps, a sort of electromagnetic Vestal Virgin? The talented Thandie Newton makes a nice sci-fi Delilah, alternately simpering & catty, but since this Samson keeps his head shaved, what's the point? All the humanity that Diesel carefully built in Riddick in ""Pitch Black"" is replaced by dull stoniness relieved on occasion by confusion. David, the only other actor returning from ""Pitch Black,"" can't help here. The vast, impressive effects are amazingly short on color. The ""Star Wars"" and ""Alien"" franchises spun elaborate backstories that lost credibility the farther they got from the first film, but they worked for a while--in fact, the second films of each franchise were the best. The ""Riddicks"" attempted far too much far too darkly & may have killed the universe's baddest tough guy more dead than princes, prisons, beasts or bimbos could ever do.",The Chronicles of Riddick
161,jon2005,The Chronicles of Riddick,7,22 May 2006,"Pitch Black was our first outing into the world of Riddick, a convict who, because of surgery on his eyes, could see in the dark. This came in very handy when the planet the ship he was on crashed in to had an eclipse and lots of hungry creatures came out to try and eat the survivors. Pitch Black was the sleeper hit of 2000, and now has a strong cult following. The thing that made the film so good was the character of Riddick who, against all clichés, didn't have a heart of gold. There was a glimpse of humanity towards the end, but he was still the ""bad guy"" of the film, the anti-hero to which we can't relate. The Chronicles of Riddick starts five years after Pitch Black ended, but this time the scale has been upped ten-fold. This makes the film feel nothing like a sequel  it perhaps tries to be too epic. Instead of a fairly claustrophobic horror film, this time we are thrown into the middle of a galaxy-wide crusade of a race called the Necromongers, who are on a quest to reach the Underverse, their ""promised land"" of sorts. The only ties with Pitch Black, other than Riddick himself, are the brief appearance of the Imam (Keith David), and the boy/girl survivor Jack (who, to make things more confusing, has not only changed her name to Kyra, but is also played by a different actress). In this respect then, it is only really necessary to see Pitch Black to get an idea as to who Riddick is, but you could probably understand Chronicles well enough if you haven't. Well, sort ofChronicles does unload a lot of plot onto the viewer right from the start, with our Judi Dench on explanation duties (she really, unfortunately, does little else in the film). If you pay attention it's all there, but can be difficult to get your head around if it's your first time seeing it  it is creating its own universe without having anything else to base it on (e.g., books, comics, TV shows, which can introduce the universe of the characters without having to weigh a film down too heavily). After a bit of explanation, we then move on to an impressive, if confusing, CGI-heavy attack on the planet Helion by the Necromongers (confusing because of the use of strobe lighting  your eyes get pounded by the strobe that it can be hard to focus on what is actually going on). From here we planet-hop our way through the plot, ending up back where we started for a well done, yet very abrupt finale. The problem with the film generally is that it seems like it's not going anywhere, and it feels quite fragmented, with different plot strands seeming not wholly relevant to the plot. The acting is also a bit of a down point  whilst Vin Diesel keeps Riddick suitably cold and there is a nice little turn from Thandie Newton as a Lady Macbeth style conspirator, the lead villains are very wooden and it doesn't help that the script for them sounds far too forced. The returning character of Kyra does seem a little pointless to me, but I suppose she does give Riddick his motivation (he does actually care about her, showing again a hint of repressed humanity). There are, however, some very entertaining parts to the film, for example an inspired scene where Riddick and a group of prisoners have to escape the planet Crematoria whilst keeping one step ahead of the approaching sunrise, which will kill them if they get touched by it. Also, the final scene with the Lord Marshall, the leader of the Necromongers, is well done, and the use of CGI to show his powers (gained from being the only person to see the Underverse and return) is very effective. But the film ends very quickly, and reduces the score for the film because of it. Granted, this film was designed to be the first part of a trilogy  and sets up the next films nicely - but it is now looking increasingly unlikely that the sequels will be made (due to poor box-office takings). This makes the ending of Chronicles incomplete and we are left feeling a tad cheated. However, if the sequels are made then they need to try and explain everything a little better and resist the temptation to expand the story too quickly  we have enough to think about as it is. Whilst The Chronicles of Riddick is not really a bad film, it does feel too different from Pitch Black that it feels a bit out of place. It also does not really stand up that well on its own  it will need the sequels to show that it was worth all the time and money spent on it. It is quite fun but nothing more, and one can't help thinking that it could have been made into so much more. However, the potential is there for the sequels to be a lot better, and we must all thank the filmmakers for ensuring that the character of Riddick was not changed, being as he is one of the coolest screen presences around. Now that all he cares about is gone, we can expect him to revert to his more animal side seen in Pitch Black. Rated: 7/10More reviews at: http://www.thelazylounge.net",The Chronicles of Riddick
162,blade-21,"No Story, No Characters and No Plot",1,28 August 2004,"I found this to be an absolutely dreadful film. True it has plenty of ""special"" effects but none are particularly original. As for the story ...it is so minimal as to be almost non-existent. The acting is wooden and the characters are no more than cyphers. Some of the actors delivery is so slow I wonder whether it is intentional to enable them to remember their lines rather than to fit the mood of the film!!I cannot think how Judie Dench found her way into the film. Although she has a relatively small part and, by the films standards, a well acted one, she would have been better leaving it alone. Maybe she wandered in off a backlot during a lunchbreak & thought ""what the heck""!! Well, its only my opinion ,but it's a turkey in every department.",The Chronicles of Riddick
163,tvalstar99,You will like this movie if you liked pitch black,7,29 June 2004,"The sequel to Pitch Black. The first thing that is new in this movie that they probably had more money for the special effects. Usually this doesn't mean that the film will be better or even as good as the first movie. But the first movie was situated on a deserted planet, so there weren't that many effect necessary. In this case it means it adds more to the Universum where Riddick lives in. Vin Diesel shows these roles are suited for him. If he can say one liners and doesn't take himself too seriously and can use his body, he is great. The thing that was different from the first movie was that Riddick now was the Good Knight in the beginning without a doubt. In Pitch Black I he was more darker. But this film is a great and wonderful action/sci-fi flick. I recommend this film highly. If you hated Diesel in XXX then you should see this movie. I think you will start to like him.",The Chronicles of Riddick
164,said-buet10,A very bad follow up of Pitch Black,3,22 July 2017,"Pitch black on its own was a great sci-fi movie due to its unique story. This on the other hand is its dumb annoying younger brother who fights a lot with an empty head over the body. Sequels are often bad but this is very very bad.If a person judges this movie solely based on its action sequences, he/she might even like this. But as a whole its far from impressive. The writers did a terrible job. The overall direction was very average. One upside is that the CGI was good for the time period it was made in.Creators should consider making an action flick with amazing fight sequence around a decent core story. When its done this way a movie becomes instant classic. The previous movie did something close to that but this failed to deliver similar performance on screen.",The Chronicles of Riddick
165,mjensen-3,"Sucked, but in a good way.",7,10 August 2004,"What I mean is this film is one of the best action films of the year, and I'm not comparing this to Kill Bill. ""The Chronicles of Riddick"" has no character development, no plot, in fact the video game is way better. In fact all Vin diesel is trash talk show his muscles and ads no demension to the character. I want to know more about Riddick, I want to think more about Riddick, did he have a family before he became what he is, or are they just going to subject us to mindless action and no plot. Hopefully they'll ad a third intallment, so I can find out.  This film needs better acting and more meaning behind the action.  Kill Bill showed that behind all of that blood thirsty action that there was a love story in the middle of it all. Why can't we get the same treatment and let it be entertaining as well.I give this film 2 out of 4 stars.",The Chronicles of Riddick
166,SoulfulFX,Who's the better killer?,8,10 July 2004,"This movie is heads and heels better than ""Pitch Black"" was, and I thought Pitch Black was a still a good movie...albeit a bit weird....Chronicles is much more epic in scope, though it askes the audience to assume quite a bit with names and places that it could have spent a little more time explaining the significance of...though you never feel lost without that information.The action scenes are great, Vin Diesel really takes the glimpses of Riddick's abilties in Pitch Black and gives them breathing room in this film.""Jack"" or Kira growing up was a nice touch though I think they made her seem just a year or so too old for the time that passed.Overall this is a really entertaining movie, definitely worth seeing for the true escapism Sci-Fi is supposed to bring.",The Chronicles of Riddick
167,Kelly-130,I really wanted to like this film,6,11 June 2004,"Perhaps my expectations were to high for this movie as I walked away disappointed. While Pitch Black isn't a prerequisite for this it certainly wouldn't hurt. The movie doesn't really explain much more about the character of Riddick. I felt like we had 2 scripts that got mixed up. The first script was about a planetary invasion by the Necromongers, a somewhat Borg like race in the fact that they expect you to become one of them or die. Yet strangely there were plenty of people left to roam the streets after the invasion.
 The second script had the improbable story of Jack from Pitch Black, now on a penal planet because she decided to become a killer so she might end up in the same prison as Riddick ( or something like that, it was pretty vague )Overall, while visually stimulating, this was sunk by a poor script with action sequences which just fell short for me.",The Chronicles of Riddick

One liners that work, and action that almost never stops. The FX are excellent, not only in technical execution, but artistic design as well. Truly wonderful to look at, especially the planet Crematoria (yes, one of those stupid names, but wow! - what design!). It takes itself seriously enough when there's story to be told (essence of Dune) and does not shy away from great battle sequences at all. Ignore the nay-sayers and treat yourself to a great ride.

169,RagingDraugr,"More Riddick, More Problems.",5,23 January 2019,"(P) Positives(N) Negatives(?) Other points/Neither positive or negative(P) The film is mostly focused on action and world-building with numerous set-pieces, thus the story is more the second priority as it were; basic but adequate.(P) The ""Riddick universe"" has been expanded substantially in this film, which, in combination with the higher budget, allows for a variety of locations (e.g. the blizzards on the harsh snow planet Riddick hides out on at the beginning of the film; the brick-and-mortar streets of Helion Prime; the half-freezing-cold, half-boiling-hot prison moon of Crematoria, the dark, cold halls of the Necromongers etc.), which are complemented by the set design, costuming etc.(P) Riddick himself has also been given an overhaul. The compassion and love he has for Jack/Kyra is made ever more present than it was in 'Pitch Black' (the first film in the series) and we also get to see the ""sassier"", wise-cracking side of Riddick - most notably in the ""I bow to no man"" scene.(P) Clever details here and there (e.g. the scar marks on the sides of converted necromongers' necks left by the instruments used to ""convince"" them to convert).(?) While the cinematography was OK, there was a lot of 'shakycam' in the fight scenes making it hard to actually see the action sometimes; particularly in the first few scenes on Helion Prime where there are so many strobe lights, it almost gave me a headache just looking at it. Luckily, these scenes didn't take up too much of the runtime.(?) Some of the moments in the film are so on the nose and are as subtle as a brick wall, it's hard not to laugh at them for how riddick-ulous (heh) they are. My favourite examples include the Lord Marshal, leader of the Necromongers, demanding information by saying, ""THESE ARE THE THINGS I NEED TO KNOW""; The computer on the ship arriving at Crematoria: ""ANGLE OF APPROACH - NOT GOOD"" as well as Toombs, a bounty hunter who's after Riddick, screaming ""RIDDICCCKKKK!"" after being locked in a cage. While these are great and memorable moments, they make it harder to take the film seriously.(N) So many issues with the plot and overall structure of the film. Firstly, there are so many characters that aren't given any time to develop - so almost none but those remaining from the first film are interesting. Secondly, some of the plot contrivances are staggering (""Why was there a knife in the necromonger-who-killed-Imam-and-was-then-killed-by-Riddick's back in the first place? What is its purpose? Why is it there? Is it a holster? If it is, it seems pretty inconvenient to have it sticking out of your back like that...""; ""Why did the Purifer release Riddick in the mind regression chamber? Couldn't he just keep him locked down and have the Necromonger guards attack him without risk of Riddick fighting back?"" --> However, the purifier is later revealed to be a Furian, like Riddick, so perhaps this was the Purifier being conflicted between being a Necromonger and a Furian, and so decided to release him...? Not too sure about this one - either it's a major plot contrivance or it's a bit of foreshadowing as to the Purifier's true nature). Not to mention the fact that Riddick killing and overthrowing the Lord Marshal was prophesied by the Elementals. Ugh, did we really need a prophecy for this? A prophecy like that is such an overused trope as it is, and the movie would have been just fine without one. Finally, the whole idea of religious subjugation by the Necromongers is interesting, but was handled with no subtlety or nuance whatsoever - making the Necromongers into a cartoonishly evil threat whose leader actively enjoyed the death and destruction he perpetuated, which left no room for any sympathetic qualities of any kind.(N) In a way, the lower budget of 'Pitch Black' actually helped to make that film more timeless, as, with 'The Chronicles Of Riddick', the higher budget meant a lot more CGI, which now looks pretty dated - whereas the CGI in 'Pitch Black' still looks OK, mostly because there was more of an emphasis on practical effects and simpler visual effects. As a result, it was a lot harder for me to get invested in this film - even though the CGI and other visual effects were well done, considering when it was made.(N) While the acting was mostly good, some performances weren't as good. Karl Urban in particular, who plays the Macbeth-like Vaako, was stilted and unbearably dry for the entire runtime of the film.Overall: 6/10; maybe a very high 5 or high 6 - but certainly not a 7.",The Chronicles of Riddick
170,shadowycat,Riddick-ulous!,3,11 June 2004,"We really wanted to like it. Is it possible that they assumed that everyone would have first seen Pitch Black, the first film in this series? I never did, and was totally lost. If you don't know this mythology, the film will suffer Zion Complex - which goes back to the Matrix trilogy. In the first Matrix movie it was about our world and Neo but through the two sequels, the focus shifts to Zion and I don't think people ultimately cared about Zion. In this sequel, we meet a very few residents of Helion, (Helion... Zion.... is it just me or do you also sense some kind of theme?) and then we see yet another hapless and anonymous multitude cowering against war and destruction by a threat of such enormous scale that it altogether dwarfs the feeble inhabitants. And we really don't know who these guys are, and why should we care?There was an inordinate amount of battling and fighting, posturing and yelling - and I became less and less enthralled. After a point, wearying from all the gnashing and struggling, I began to shift around in my seat. It was loud and belligerent and I buried my face into BF's shoulder, thinking I could listen without having to watch. I closed my eyes, gradually tuning out the incomprehensible grumbling and wrestling and shooting noises, and soon I drifted off to sleep.Boyfriend shook me awake and we made eye contact, then we both laughed really hard. From that point though, I was even more lost.In one vignette, evil prisoners deal with evil hellhounds and these are great beasts. They should have their own movie, I LOVED them. This segment really had nothing to do with moving the plot forward, but the beasts were great. There was a cool space ship or two, and Dame Judi Dench is fantastic as the Elemental. Diesel and Dench are World Class. The rest of the cast are uneven. We are never told what the necromongers are after, or anything at all about the Furians except that they seem to have super-powers.Ultimately, my idea of Science Fiction is that it needs to be either literate or philosophic/moral, maybe explore some sort of specific technologies, or all of the above. It's not just great makeup, great scenic design, imaginative robots or ships and wildly scary WMD. This describes fantasy genre to me, rather than Sci-Fi. Just being set in space doesn't make a film Sci-fi.The film promotes itself as being Science Fiction, but my sense is that it is more like Comic Book Fantasy, which is fine, but it's an important promise and I did not feel that the film makes good. Graeme Revell's soundtrack is worthy, the visuals are very inventive, but I walked out wanting the past two hours back. Too bad this is a bomb, because it so didn't have to be.",The Chronicles of Riddick
171,Freemheart,A dream comes true,10,16 August 2004,"David Twohy is back, one of the few good filmmakers who really know how to make real good science fiction movies, and nothing better than a sequel from his masterpiece: Pitch Black. This time Twohy change his own story to tells something different, to create a new universe under the eyes of one of the best new characters to the science fiction: Riddick Who is Riddick? Riddick is some kind of Conan from other kind of world, I mean: a man who uses all his knowledge and power to survive the extreme situations, a being beyond the good and evil. So The Chronicles of Riddick as I said is the sequel of Pitch Black, the next chapter of the exploration of this man, this time five years have past and a new empire (necromongers)is destroying every world to spread a religion about the power. But the best chance to stop them is the help of a lost race of warrior from where Riddick belongs, the problem with is Riddick he is  a loner with his own rules and own vision of the universe so this is not his war, but by the circumstances he will be forced to fight just to save the only people who mean something for him: the last bound of humanity or goodness. What makes incredible this film?: The unique vision of Twohy, who show us at least three planets full of details, great characters and good dialogue, the deep relation with Pitch Black and the short animate, Dark Fury and much more.
   I been a science fiction fan for more than twenty years, reading from Asimov to Herbert, watching from Star trek to Babylon 5, so if there's something I know well is how ignorants are the critics when they have to make a review of a scifi movie, they don't even understand basic concepts of science, so they destroy almost every to tell only good things about those easy and brainless stories, nothing far beyond from Riddick. This is the best Science fiction movie I have this year, the special effects are great but not only for the action scene, because Twohy create a fascinating universe with many good details.              A dream comes true for those who want something adult and far better than the new star wars trilogy, something with the roots of the classic literature of science fiction.",The Chronicles of Riddick
172,soulcharmer,Review for Unrated version only.,8,6 December 2004,"I saw theatrical version of Riddick a while back and I was kinda disappointed. But I knew that version was not only shortened, the story was toned down for stupid people to understand it and some slightly more explicit content was censored so the movie could obtain PG-13 rating. I decided not to review it until Director's cut was out.Now when I saw DC version I can rejoice for being patient. Everything that was good in theatrical version is still there: great special effects, good action and plot twists. Minor things, really. What is better in DC version is that we get deeper insight into Riddick's origins, we get better motivations for characters, some more of a story is portrayed, some stupid dialogues lines are out and finally, explicit content is there. It's nothing much but in whole I got the feeling the flick made more sense. In terms of acting, let's just say I find the performances appropriate for the genre. One thing I have noticed in dialogues: not once had I heard line ""Are you alright?"" or ""Everything is gonna be okay"". Not once. This kind of stuff counts... for me.I think Riddick made it after all, but please avoid theatrical version.8/10",The Chronicles of Riddick

176,silverkelt,Underrated and under appreciated Dark Scifi,7,24 March 2015,"First off, this really isn't pitch black, pitch black was a small indie scifi film, which shows what you can do with a very small budget, good story telling and compatible acting. This is more of a standard big budget affair, encapsulated in a antihero of Riddick. Vin Diesel reprising his role, is again fairly resplendent as the dark Riddick, not quite evil, he has a moral code, but its his moral code, you will not force him away from it. Its not maybe the best in its genre and I can see its failings, its slow to spin up and at times you have to set aside your logical conclusions or assumptions, the universe its set in, isn't always fleshed out the best, you have to infer things.Overall though, its pretty solid and after watching it a couple more times have to say, it was better then when I first watched it. Too bad it ran so poorly, it deserved its on sequel, what we got was just Riddick, which wasn't quite as good as its predecessors.",The Chronicles of Riddick
177,DrLex,Fun but over-ambitious baroque sci-fi,6,25 February 2009,"The main problem with this movie is that it is over-ambitious to say the least. Its predecessor, 'Pitch Black', was simple in its design and this was one of the reasons for its success. Although there appeared to be more behind PB's main characters, we only got a glimpse of their backgrounds. This made them the more interesting. In 'Chronicles', we are bombarded with an overload of information and detail. Not just about the characters, but of the entire universe in which they live. After seeing 'Chronicles', pretty much every question you might have about Riddick is likely to be answered. There is a hint to a sequel, but it could take a while before they can imagine enough new material to compensate for all the creative ammo they used up here. As I'll explain below, a prequel may be a better option.The whole set-up of 'Chronicles' feels like they wanted to fit the characters ported over from 'Pitch Black' into a more elaborate framework, and asked a team of writers to construct an entire detailed universe around those characters, with every planet and race plotted out, histories and everything included. It's as if they had a Star Wars-like universe constructed on demand. The major difference with Star Wars is that instead of using the universe as a vehicle to present interesting and developing characters, 'Chronicles' seems to be more about the universe itself than the characters. I guess the universe was expensive to create, so they wanted to show off as much of it as they could. The most interesting character development is probably to be found somewhere in the universe's design documents, and may end up in books based on the same universe, or a prequel.Not just the story, but the entire movie breathes excess in its set pieces and visuals. It has a definite 'upgraded Dune' feel to it. The obsession for baroque design by the Necromonger race in 'Chronicles' seems to have spilled over to the directors. The amount of CGI is humongous. I believe the actors spent most of their time acting in front of blue and green screens. This wouldn't be so much of a problem if it didn't show: the CGI has this 'glossy' feel to it that makes it look like the graphics in many current video-games, and I'm afraid it will make the movie look dated in the near future.Then there are the action scenes: it seems like the directors wanted to show so much of the fighting that in the end, there's nothing to see because of the extremely jerky and flashy editing. At many times it's just impossible to see what happens. I don't recommend this movie to people with epilepsy.Nevertheless, if you're willing to sit through the history lessons, 'Chronicles' is a load of fun. Maybe not in the way the makers intended it, but at least through the sometimes (insert over-used pun if desired) ridiculous extravagance of the whole thing, for instance the improbable costumes and decorations of the space ships. The funny one-liners you'd expect from a Vin Diesel movie are present. There are some interesting action scenes next to the choppy ones, and at a few scarce moments you may even get a hint of the suspense that made Pitch Black so great. Stripped from its complicated universe, the story is pretty simple but it does the job.Overall, 'Chronicles' is far from the masterpiece it aspires to be, but it's still OK entertainment. If it does bore you, you can still amuse yourself by counting how many times Riddick takes off and puts on his goggles for dramatic effect.",The Chronicles of Riddick
178,shido-san,Grand Science Fiction,8,17 July 2009,"As classic a sci-fi in grandeur as Pitch Black was in alien life-form.. there are a lot of points to dwell on in this movie, not the least of which is the enigmatic Riddick character. Not perfect, but few movies are. Riddick captures a Frank Herbert -like universe although without the higher intergalactic political intrigue, and mixes in with it a scourge essential from a different dimension. But, what is really fun with this motion picture is an incarceration facility established on a planet close enough to its star to be uninhabitable by any life forms.

179,grafspee2,Conan the Barbarian in Space,10,23 November 2005,"THIS IS A REVIEW OF THE DIRECTORS CUT (DVD VERSION)If you can recall Arnold Schwarzeneggar gutting James Earl Jones with a sword in the final scene of John Milius's masterpiece--this film replicates it exceptionally well. I am not going to comment on the general reactions to this film upon its initial release, nor will I devote much time the story or continuous plot from Pitch Black, Chronicles of Riddick or the potential third portion of the trilogy.This film had great design, necromonger art-architecture, planets and costumes that remind one of the flying monkeys in the Wizard of Oz. The music filled the mood of the film exceptionally well thanks to the work of Graeme Revell. And Vin Diesel (as full producer and the title character, Riddick) was able to bring in some terrific actors to lend creditability to the production such as Colm Feore, Dame Judi Dench, Thandie Newton, Karl Urban, Nick Chinlund and Keith David. This is not to say the film was perfection in celluloid, there is some painfully bad casting and dialogue exchanges. Chuck Norris needed to be cast, or maybe Chuck Bronson. Don't watch this with high expectations of an art house film that is about 'real issues' or features Tilda Swinton. Just try to remember the Scottish play--MacBeth and Conan the Barbarian because their influence is more than evident.The Chronicles of Riddick is a great film if you are willing to drop the cynical view of action-adventure transgenre science fiction. Watch it with an open mind because some of the elements used in this film have never been done quite so well.",The Chronicles of Riddick
180,matjpi,Welcome to the Under...pants,3,14 March 2012,"When Mr. Vincent/Diesel accepted this role, I'm sure he was thinking about the loot rather than ""what the flying flapjack was the writer/director playing at?"" Aping Ridley Scott's style in every way except his talent we understood immediately what the Underverse would be like. Dark. Foreboding. Portentous. All the time. Nobody will rest. Or eat. People will fight. And sneer. All the time. Lines will be delivered. In small. Pieces. There was only one tiny thing wrong with the screenplay: the words. Oh ... and the plot.Please pass me a set of lightly gritted teeth. No ... wait ... they're already on screen. As a fan of Pitch Black I know Diesel can do better and I certainly know Judi Dench can. Most of the cast was OK, considering that their lines were tediously portentous and pompous without the slightest sprinkle of conviction. The sets were impressive and the cinematography particularly so as the grips managed to do their jobs without flailing to the ground in a tangle of cables they couldn't see. At one point Dench appeared to be addressing a pillar and my hopes briefly rose that the pillar might have some insightful lines to relieve the tedium. Alas, the pillar remained wisely silent, probably as instructed by its agent.Thandie Newton's (as Dame Vaako) slinky appearance added a certain frisson but her time on camera was short and even if she had done a slow striptease it probably wouldn't have helped the overall film.For die-hard sci-fi fans who can suspend their disbelief powerfully enough, I think the film may entertain. It has action and scrapping and the like. But for anyone who likes a believable plot with half-intelligent dialogue this is a film to see either st*ned or tr*pping. Even then you may feel the urge to boo. If you're still conscious.",The Chronicles of Riddick
181,ncc1205,Pitch Hitting!,6,13 June 2004,"Well, I just came back in from a showing of RIDDICK, and I have to say that I'm honestly a bit confused about all the critical bashing its taken. I won't do a full review as others have really already covered that territory, but I'll offer a few salient remarks:(1) Riddick, as a character, comes off as sci-fi-dom's near-perfect anti-hero here, so I do sympathize with those who found it a tad difficult to really get behind him in this adventure. He fought the establishment, prefering simple existence, and ended up ... well ... I won't spoil the very end for those of you who've yet to see the flick.(2) It's clearly a set-up picture in much the same way that other science fiction outings have done before. It works to establish its own universe (or was it Underverse? Unterverse? I couldn't quite tell), and, again, on that level I thought it worked just fine.(3) Go in expecting the greatest science fiction film of all time, and you're sure to be expected. Go in expecting to see a bad-ass version of FLASH GORDON, and you really should be okay with the film.(4) I thought the pacing throughout the film was way off. I don't know that I'd say it was edited poorly, but there were several sequences (particularly some of the fighting bits) that were put together just too darn fast. It was difficult to 'absorb' what was going on -- other than Riddick's butt-kicking antics -- but they could've slowed it down a bit to appreciate all of those limbs being broken.(5) Dame Judy Dench, I thought, did a nice bit, though it felt far more like a cameo than a role intended for Gandalfesque greatness.(6) LOSE THE GOOFY VOICEOVERS! I don't care what Riddick's thinking: I only care whose ass he's going to kick next! Granted, there weren't many of them, but, when they popped up, I have to say that felt extraordinarily out of place with the rest of the narrative.(7) Visually, the film rocked. I thought the effects were very good, and I loved the Gothic feel to much of the set design.(8) The film had several continuity problems (props suddenly being where they weren't in the last scene, expressions being different from what they were in the last cut, etc.), and, if anything, I'd have to say this was -- for a nitpicker -- one of the big flaws of the film.That's really all I can add. Sure, it wasn't the most thrilling adventure, but I didn't feel as though I were short-changed in any way as I left the theatre. There are always things that could've been tweaked and/or tossed, and RIDDICK had it's share. But I really don't understand the critical bashing b/c if this were a tale -- a western, a drama -- that took place under less otherworldly circumstances, the film probably would've scored higher with critics.As a general rule, I think most critics just don't get science fiction and/or science fantasy, and that has probably contributed to the low marks.",The Chronicles of Riddick

183,dcw-12,All you could ask for from a sci-fi epic,9,13 June 2008,"I honestly don't know what the complaints with this film from the established circle of 'critics' was. Was it that the introductory notion of needing to use evil to fight evil somehow conflicted with their value system? Was it that some dislike had been brewing among reviewers towards Vin Diesel and they used this film to express it? Was it that the reviewers don't get this style of sci-fi which is admittedly slightly over the top?Whatever it was it seemed like the movie was treated very unfairly by the press.If you have only heard of this film from critics reviews and like sci-fi you will be pleasantly surprised when you see this film.It is another great continuation of the legacy of space opera. It combines grand themes of good and evil and puts them in a visually stunning and epic universe. Vin Diesel's acting is a little hammy but he fills the role well, and the way he plays it didn't feel at all out of place.The special effects are awesome and the themes are interesting. The fight scenes are brewing with menace, and the villains are totally evil and repulsive.Who could ask for more from a sci-fi film? One of my top 10 sci-fi films of all time! How could it get 28% on Rotten Tomatoes I will never know, just solidifies my disgust with mainstream 'critics'.",The Chronicles of Riddick
184,SandeepLoyalka,Very good...deserves a chance!,8,29 July 2009,"This is a film that was undeservedly thrashed commercially & critically on its initial release. It has since gained a cult following and rightly so. 'The Chronicles Of Riddick' is a weighty, action epic that attempts to fashion a mythology based upon the character created by star Diesel and director Twohy in their earlier collaboration, 'Pitch Black'. But where that film was more an intimate thriller, 'The Chronicles Of Riddick' is an extravaganza in the truest sense of the word. Boasting immaculate set design, stunning costumes and fabulous CGI-rendered backdrops & SFX, it is enthralling entertainment. With its obvious Biblical and Shakespearean undertones, 'The Chronicles Of Riddick' consistently delights not only as a sci-fi action adventure, but also as an interesting, well-rounded story that really needs/deserves to be taken forward. Diesel, with his limited acting abilities, seems to have found the perfect role, which helps showcase his deadpan expressions to his advantage and underlines his ability to deliver one-liners very effectively. Thandie Newton, essentially playing Lady Macbeth, is deliciously evil whereas Dame Judi Dench, albeit saddled with a small part, is truly ethereal. David Twohy directs with an assured hand and never allows the glitz to overpower the absorbing tale being told. Watch it...you won't be disappointed!",The Chronicles of Riddick
185,three_am,Unique among most,8,20 March 2008,"I saw this the first time it came out in the theater in 2004. I recently walked into Blockbuster and saw this playing in the background and it piqued my interest again to borrow it and watch it. I was able to appreciate various different things this time around since in my mind it wasn't being compared to the other epic movies that were around the same time.Vin Diesel as a leading action man actually gave the movie its humorous edge and it worked. His one-liners through out all the action and suspense was cheesy but effective. The special effects were excellent. I liked the look of the character Lord of the Necromongers. The way he moved was creepy but fascinating to see each time he displayed speed or violence. The stand out scenes for me was between the scheming husband and wife, played by Thandie Newton and Karl Urban. Of course the fact that they were also very sexy to watch is a plus. Although the narrative is not an original sci-fi story, the different ideas mixed together was well done (the mysterious underverse, Riddick being the last Furyan that carries the anger of his entire race).Overall, I recommend this movie for its epic-ness and unique story-telling.",The Chronicles of Riddick
186,freshorange,Still very good - after almost 20 years!,10,9 September 2021,"Riddick is a visionary movie in which you can tell in every scene that the director wanted to create something unique. He succeeded completely! The movie immediately draws you into a breathtaking universe, in which the Necromongers subjugate other worlds and their people and spread fear and horror. At the same time, Riddick opposes this and becomes - rather involuntarily - the savior of the galaxy. It exudes a lot of hope - despite the many excellent action sequences and a dystopian attitude - and takes you emotionally with it. Vin Diesel is excellent in his role as Riddick and the other actors are also convincing. The story is exciting until the end and the director uses a pinch of humor here and there, which is good for the movie. The true quality of a movie only becomes apparent after years. How does a it age? Does it pass this test or fail mercilessly? Riddick is one of those movies that has passed this test with flying colors after almost 20 years!",The Chronicles of Riddick

Yeah sure, this movie is not the ""all time best movie"" in the world. It's not mind blowing, heart stopping and I didn't cry. But it was really fun. FUN ! The action - fight stuff was right on. The actors were good enough. The sets and planets looked great. Time flew by. We cheered and laughed. I didn't feel cheated paying $8.50 for the ticket. Not all my friends would have liked ""Chronicles of Riddick"". The hand picked few who went with me did. My only problem was with Jack-now-Kiera(or however you spell her name)looks. Boy, for living in a nasty-butt prison she sure can get her hands on great non-smear eye make-up and hair care products. I wish they would have had her just a touch more ""real"" looking.

189,charliegeeza,A Science Fiction Epic,9,7 November 2013,"Like many others, I went in to this film experience expecting another Pitch Black. Like I imagine almost all viewers were at the end, I came out thoroughly entertained by a science fiction epic that is about as good as it gets.As the title suggests, the plot follows the adventures of Riddick. After escaping the world in Pitch Black, we learn he has isolated himself on a desolate planet as he feels he is too dangerous. When he is forced to fend off mercenaries who have located him, he decides to hunt down the only people who knew his location in order to find out why they sold him out. His arrival on an inhabited planet coincides with the invasion by a nomadic army that is on a Holy conquest of destruction across the galaxy.The plot traverses a variety of environments and sub-adventures and none of it disappoints. The presentation is flawless for the budget, and the characters and actors are all superb in their roles. The film is full of memorable scenes and lines as Riddick's character is brilliantly expanded upon. This is the way sequels should be made - taking the best characters of the original in a new direction. It is very hard to think of any criticism of Chronicles of Riddick that doesn't come down to it's very nature; it essentially is as good as it ever could have been without making it an entirely different film.The cast is superb. Vin Diesel expertly reprises his role as Riddick, while Colm Feore and Thandie Newton steal the scenes they are in. With the likes of Judi Dench and Karl Urban also in major roles, the performances of all the major characters are very strong and I was easily absorbed for the majority of the film.I can see why it may not be to everybody's tastes, as I imagine you have to be partial to your sci-fi to really get lost in Chronicles of Riddick, but if you do then you'll have a very fun time.",The Chronicles of Riddick
190,El_Rey_De_Movies,An overblown mess of a movie,1,22 March 2005,"""Riddick"" has got to be the worst science fiction film I've seen in a long time, at least since Travolta's ""Battlefield Earth"". From the frankly pretentious introduction from writer/director David Twohy, all the way thru to the mind-numbing finale, all you get is a parade of great eye candy used in the service of a muddled and incoherent story. Riddick, who was just a simple convict in ""Pitch Black"", is now transformed into something called a Furyan, some sort of super warrior race that was wiped out by the other races or by the big bad Necromongers (what a stupid name!) - after seeing it twice, I still can't figure that one out. It's the same ridiculous ""twist"" that Stephen Sommers used in ""The Mummy Returns"" with Brendan Fraser's character; it didn't work then and it sure doesn't work here, either. You also get Judy Dench (""M"" from the Pierce Brosnan Bond movies) as something called an air elemental who can turn into some sort of foggy stuff and can glide (but not fly!) but who has really nothing at all to do with the story. The main villains, a religious sect called the Necromongers, are pitched to us as the supreme evil in the universe, a force that will destroy all human life wherever it's found (which makes you wonder why they have wives). Problem is, they seem to be more interested in a pedestrian and boring power struggle for their throne than in carrying out their ""holy mission"". The movie drops you right into the middle of this mess - I suppose that it was meant to be an intriguing way to start the movie but after the first 30 minutes you'll still be scratching your head trying to figure what the heck's going on. If you haven't seen ""Pitch Black"", then you won't understand a good half of the movie anyway.But the real problem with this thing is the utter and unrelenting darkness of the whole thing - all the characters that exhibit any kind of humanity are killed, leaving us only with the cardboard villains or the cardboard ""hero"" who mouth insipid and repellent lines like ""you keep what you kill"" which, from the last shot, appears to be some sort of moral Twohy is trying to teach us. There's never any real suspense or sense that Riddick is in danger - he's just an indestructible cypher who you know will win the big showdown against the Evil Leader in the end. To make it even worse, this is a ""director's cut"" which in this case means that you get a movie that is even more boring than the theatrical release. A waste of money to make, and a waste of money to watch.",The Chronicles of Riddick
191,BaiNst,A How To Guide For Survival On An Uninhabitable Planet,5,14 June 2004,"The only reason I went to see this film is that I read another review on IMDB stating that it wasn't great, but it was better than Hellboy or Van Helsing. It's true that it wasn't great, but neither was it any better than either of those other two films. After having seen it, I'd agree with another reviewer here, comparing it to a cross of Conan, Battlefield Earth, and XXX (or some other third film that I'm not recalling correctly).The combat sequences are hard to follow, reminding me of cartoon fights, where the combatants are hidden in a cloud of smoke, with fists and feet and stars flying around inside the cloud, and you don't know what's happening exactly, or who's winning, but by god you know there's a fight taking place, and once the dust settles, then you see who's come out on top.And there's certainly a suspension of disbelief called for when watching any action or science fiction film, but this doesn't mean you have to believe that characters can swim through hot lava. Not that this film had anything quite that ridiculous, but when you're having your heroes running around in minus 300 degree weather wearing only t-shirts, it's insulting to ask the audience to believe that they'd be able to make it more than a hundred yards before going into catatonic shock. I'd have warned of a spoiler there, but thought it better that you know this before going in.This ridiculous movie had me in stitches, and despite there being a full theater, and my normal aversion to creating a nuisance unless drunk, I couldn't help but cough out a pseudo-stifled ""b*llsh*t"" when Riddick managed to ""dodge"" the 700 degree wave of flames created by the rising sun, only to hide in the miraculous shade of this planet where apparently there's a 600 degree difference between shade and sunshine. Imagine that on Earth, eh? I was laughing out loud for most of the last third of the movie.If you want to see a very bad movie that lends itself well to ridicule, and you're entertained by such things, I highly recommend seeing this.

TV: Stargate and at the movies: the mummy. And then you throw Vin diesel (Riddick) in and boom. You got a movie made for 110 million dollars (which you wouldn't notice if somebody hasn't told you) and then action, action, action. Althou a ripoff it's really fun to watch and I admit, It has it's moments. So althou with many ideas stolen it's a trashy action adventure that makes you want to watch the 2 hours and 13 minutes the DVD provides. So my advise buy it, and have some fun (but there is one important thing you should never do: try to make sense of it! Because if you do that the whole experience is kinda lost).

He claimed in an interview that he had to spend 5 months in the forest to truly understand Riddick's emotions and to play the part, well, your sacrifice has payed off!Necromongers threaten the existence of the universe, so, rather begrudgingly, Riddick allies with the human race to fight against them, but on the way he meets some old friends and get put in prison.

195,nixar55,My favorite summer movie!,9,13 August 2004,"Riddick might not have been the *best*-made movie this summer, but it was my favorite. It had more action than Spider-Man 2, and was darker than Harry Potter 3. I also think it had more interesting ideas and a greater visual flair than both of these films. Riddick was total escapist fun, with lots of funny one-liners and Vin Diesel playing his best character, Riddick. Other great performances were given by Karl Urban (looking very anti-Eomer in his black mohawk) and especially, the bounty hunter Tooms (?).Sure, there were some plot holes, and some hammy acting (mostly Thandie Newton), but it was so refreshing to see an original ""hero"", one that wasn't a 100% pure teenage boy with magical powers. Sure, Harry Potter and Peter Parker may get tempted by evil, like all proper heroes, but audiences *know* they'll turn good again. Not so with Riddick; he lives in the dark side, making it actually surprising when he does something compassionate.Also refreshing was a science fiction/fantasy story that didn't involve hobbits, computers, and massive swarms of CGI Agent Smith/orc armies. This movie was more like Dune, with an H.R. Giger edge. My only real complaint was that the movie was PG-13, when it should've been R, like ""Pitch Black."" And maybe that's why some of the violent scenes seemed choppy and confusing - to show enough to keep it PG-13. But the unrated DVD comes out in November.Also, the ending of this movie was awesome: just really funny and cool. It left me smiling for awhile afterward.",The Chronicles of Riddick
196,stephen-dhondt,"far from original, but still great fun ...",8,19 August 2004,"Like everyone I guess, I simply adored Pitch Black. So it's no big surprise that I eagerly awaited The Chronicles of Riddick. So here's my view on it: 1. the writing could have been better and a little more thought through. I mean come on, a half dead race called ""necromancers"", Elementals, a scorching hot planet called Crematoria??? a little originality never hurt anyone, but for this movie they didn't even try apparently. 2. the first 20 minutes of this film suck big time. But that's just because you are introduced to too much stuff you don't really need to know to enjoy the rest of the movie. ""underverse"" ... I'm sure it'll be explored further in the following sequels, but in this particular story it was of no use. What else made the introduction suck? the screen was filled with either bad sets, or too much blurry FX, but hey, we'll get over it. 3. the designs for the rest of the movie are superb. like Dune but far far better. Gigantic spaceships that the necromancers use. the craft that bounty hunter tombs flies around with ... all worthy of a summer blockbuster. 4. the story basically sucks big time. there's nothing here we haven't seen before and much much better. necromancers could easily have been the borg from star trek, running from a deadly sunrise, prison planets, ... but it is the way this movie presents everything as a well drawn out universe that makes it work. 5. Vin Diesel (what's in a name) isn't the new Schwarzenegger, he's not even the next sly Stallone ... he's soooo much more than both of them put together. he's got a presence you can't ignore. so much charisma it's almost painful to the eye. and he can out-act any other big muscled bonehead out there (yes I mean you ""rock"" boy). 6. Changing boyish Jack to sexy vixen Kyra in only 5 years is forced no matter how you twist and turn. 7. Can someone PLEASE erase Colm Feore from the ""bad guy"" casting list? 8. Can someone PLEASE put Thandee Newton in more movies!OK, in conclusion : this sequel is not inferior to its original. it's like Hannibal was to Silence of the Lambs. it's a different turn on a known setting. it's different, but that doesn't make it bad.

They even have ""lens"" men (though they are completely different from the Doc Smith classic definition I thought that was a funny, but cloaked reference).The planet Crematoria forms an excellent ""Deathworld"" scenario ala the Harry Harrison Deathworld series which pits human beings against a truly ferociously overwhelming environment. Superb!The only real flaw in the movie is the ""romance"" doesn't really go anywhere and should probably not even have been attempted.

198,TheScottman,Great Character Not So Great Movies,4,10 July 2006,"I thought Pitch Black was an OK movie, but it took me a long time to see this sequel to it. I always liked the character Riddick, he doesn't need special powers or anything, he should just stay as he was in Pitch Black (2000). He started off that way in this movie which I enjoyed, but then he started to do things that were not in Riddick's character. He cared about people, he tried to play the ""good guy."" I loved when he was a bad guy, but you still wanted him to live.I have no complaints with Vin Diesel besides the writers changed his character a little bit. Karl Urban, and Nick Chinlund did a great job as minor bad guy (in Riddick's eyes) and I wanted them to have more screen time. I liked the idea of Keith David's character Imam returning in this film, but I didn't like the whole Kyra/Jack story line. It just doesn't fit the Riddick character we met in Pitch Black.If you don't like sci-fi movies that create a universe and put a lot of thought into it then this movie isn't for you. This is an action movie with a sci-fi surrounding, if you don't mind that then I recommend this movie for you. It's not an awesome movie, but the characters make up for what the story lacks.

199,redfearnb,Great sci-fi flick with great action scenes.,7,17 March 2006,"I really liked this movie. Some knock it for its plot and characters, but of course Vin Diesel is no actor extraordinaire, he's in a movie for fighting, and fighting is what The Chronicles of Riddick does well.This movie has a feeling like Dune; the science fiction, futuristic genre. I love the story as it is a sequel to Pitch Black, which I have not seen yet. Riddick, hunted by mercenaries, ends up on a planet that is soon overrun by Necromongers, a half-dead army bent of taking over the universe by force. So, Riddick (Diesel), ends up taking on the entire army by himself, bringing several people along with him during his journey, one of which end up being his sister.Riddick then takes on the ""god"" leading the Necromongers and wins in their duel. Riddick then becomes the leader of the Necromongers and the viewer is left wondering what might happen in the future, which means a third installment in the Pitch Black series is probably coming sometime. A third story has been released already, but it was in animated form, so perhaps a movie will be released sometime.All in all, I really liked this movie and was happy to see that the needless cussing was cut out for the official release, although there is an unrated version as well. There isn't any sex at all, so I guess that the unrated version just has some better killing and lots of the ""F"" word in it?",The Chronicles of Riddick

The film looks dreadful: horrible derivative blurry CGI, awful editing, what seemed like a constant strobe light effect, bad acting, truly boring characters, a slog of a plot--this is one of the worst sci-fi films in recent memory.  The mainstream critics who have been comparing it to Battlefield Earth are not kidding.  If you are sci-fi fans, you'll see it, the same way I did, but geez, will you regret it.

Not much motivation for the necromongers (i.e. the bad guys) except that they were bad guys - but that did not get in the way.  Talking of which, nice performances from those bad guys, especially Karl Urban from The Lord of the Rings (Eomer) actually playing pretty much the same part - except on the side of the ""Orcses"" this time hahaha.No need to have seen the execrable, dirt-cheap Pitch Black to follow this new movie, it is a sequel only in that it includes Riddick - which is just as well.",The Chronicles of Riddick

This isn't supposed to be an Oscar winner - it's a summer movie.  It has good action, the story is plausible enough to hold interest, and the relationships are well enough developed that you care about (Jack) Kyra before the end arrives.  I liked that Riddick put his life on the line to save hers at one point.  This is a well made, well acted, acceptable summer action flick.  Don't try to get it to make any more sense than that, because it won't.  Riddick is still a loner, still a killer, and still finds himself manipulated by larger issues into doing ""the right thing"" despite himself. He gets to kick ass and take names in the higher issue of serving good - and he gets one hell of a good reward for doing it.  Who could ask for more?",The Chronicles of Riddick
203,Daelock,Good For What It Is,8,18 June 2004,"I'll make this short since it's already been commented on by many and I'd just be regurgitating what they've said: I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It's been awhile since the action/sci-fi niche has been so thoroughly filled (Star Wars Episode 2 sure didn't do it) but that's exactly what CoR is: ACTION/Sci-Fi. You don't go into an Ahnuld movie expecting a wondrous plot and deep characters, you expect to see people fighting and blowing up. This movie delievers that and delievers it well. I wish it had been rated R so the fights could be more visceral, but it doesn't ruin the experience. 8/10",The Chronicles of Riddick
204,lochnessmummy,Just as good as Pitch Black (wouldn't you know),5,13 June 2004,"The Chronicles of Riddick is the sequel to the earlier Vin Diesel sci-fi flick Pitch Black. Like the first one, this movie is highly flawed but has a lot of cool aspects to it.Right from the beginning, it's obvious that this film's first priority is special effects, which they did very well. Even better than the effects though, were the costumes and art direction. The Necromongers created a society that idolizes suffering, betrayal, and death, and each of these concepts are thoroughly infused into their amazing --sometimes horrifying-- architecture and armor. Their culture was one that sought to prepare the galaxy and the races of men for the manifestation of the Underverse (which I really wanted to know more about). The fanatical devotion and divine inspiration to do evil was nicely brought out by the filmmakers.It's too bad that this film was written the way it was. It greatly lacked focus, which resulted in what should have been a compelling subplot where two ambitious courtiers conspire to kill the main bad guy instead becomes a feeble distraction with bad acting. Also, the whole Crematoria sequence fell just short of being nothing but a humongous waste of time. The only part that redeemed it (slightly) was Riddick's exchange with the Purifier. They should have skipped much of that planet.The bulk of this movie is made up of a lot of predictable, derivative ideas (the prison planet, panicked citizens running for their lives but yet not going anyhwere) mixed in with a lot of really inspired details (the race of elementals, the behavior of space dust with traveling starships). The Riddick story features a rich and interesting sci-fi setting, and if they paid more attention to that instead of Hollywood poser shots, they'd really have something.",The Chronicles of Riddick
205,wmhogg,A really enjoyable sci-fi action movie,10,11 June 2004,"I just returned from seeing Chronicles of Riddick, and I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. I can't wait to see it again. It was great fun.I really appreciate the depth of the universe that David Twohy and the Wheat brothers create. They show us glimpses of wondrous things and people that I am dying to know more about. There is so much back-story here, that it just screams for a sequel.Admittedly, I am a fan of Pitch Black, so I came to the theater prepared to like the movie. I had the same reaction to this movie that I had when seeing the first Star Wars movie, Dune, and the Matrix. I was totally captivated by worlds I had not seen on the screen before. Vin Diesel is more overtly the hero in this movie than in Pitch Black. However, he still has his quiet-spoken, menacing moments that remind us that he is a killer, and is lethal when crossed.I had not seen Alexa Davalos before, but thought she did a great job, and handled the action scenes and the drama well. Karl Urban (Eomer from LOTR) is very good as the brooding, troubled warrior. I also enjoyed Thandie Newton as the almost Shakespearean character who urges her reluctant mate to take action, and seize the destiny that she believes is rightfully his.",The Chronicles of Riddick
206,wmhogg,The Director's Cut is a great improvement,10,19 November 2004,"I'm a fan of both Pitch Black and Chronicles of Riddick. I liked Pitch Black for its creative cinematography, the Riddick character, and the spookiness of the creatures found on the planet. I also enjoyed the fresh presentation of the ""who is the real monster"" theme. I think Vin Diesel was great in that film.I liked Chronicles because I am a devoted Sci-Fi fan. While I think I could recommend Pitch Black to most people, I would say that if you're not into Sci-Fi, you may not enjoy this film. I'm not sure that even being a Vin Diesel fan would guarantee that a viewer would like this movie. For Sci-Fi fans, I think this film would be very enjoyable, and I heartily recommend it. For me, it was pure eye-candy, and I thought the special effects were very well done. I liked the entire cast of Chronicles - they were a lot of fun to watch, especially Karl Urban as Vaako, and Alexa Davalos as Jack/Kyra. The Director's Cut seemed to me to smooth out wrinkles in the plot of the theatric release. I wish this version had been in the theaters, because I think the movie would have been much more appealing.I love all of the references to things that seem to have such a huge back-story, e.g., the Furyans, and the Elementals, but are barely explained in the movie. It makes me wonder if there is a book, or series of books that will explore these areas in more detail, or whether this has all been dealt with in the video game(s) that I have not played. I have seen Dark Fury which is interesting in its own right.I think that for Sci-Fi fans, this movie is a rich treat, with great visual effects, a true super-hero fighting evil, amazing action sequences, and a David Twohy universe that obviously has more to it than what we have already seen. I'd love to see another David Twohy film in this series, not necessarily a sequel, but something in the Riddick universe that is as entertaining as the first two films have been.",The Chronicles of Riddick
207,OpinionatedJM,If you felt comfortable with Fast and Furious.. rock on,4,25 April 2006,"I will not by any means compare it to anything truly weighty and not found lacking, BUT it is fun watching Vin Diesel interpreting Vin Diesel for the nth time (kinda like watching Shack missing a penalty again).In sci-fi you get used to looking for the special effects.... TERRIBLE, in the video game sense, at the beginning of the movie I decided ""I'm just gonna pretend it's fun to watch video game effects"" and then it was cool, until I saw the special features on the DVD where the special effects guy takes it all so seriously! but even that gave me a good laugh.There wasn't anything too special about the story either but it's one of those films you can just get together and have a good time with, where you can bring you girlfriend along and her friend and you can all just laugh and comment about all the goofy stuff going on and have a beer or two.",The Chronicles of Riddick
208,patrickmaura,Good Flick,8,11 June 2004,"If you want decent action you got it with this movie. A simple style plot fine by me. I was thoroughly entertained by Riddick. It should of had a R rating as riddick is an R rated character.Special effects the feel of the world all work well. If you want to see a good action movie worth this is it. I liked this better then the last 2 starwars films although some might say thats not saying much, but those movies still made some serious cash and I just dont think the marketing for this movie has been that great.If your a red blooded male who likes things that blow up and knives and guns and more knives and more guns. Grab your self a bucket of popcorn and coke and sit down for a fun ride.3/4",The Chronicles of Riddick
209,sackleywhistle,A new mythology rises,5,2 September 2004,"Fans of 2000's Pitch Black probably need to adjust their expectations for this one. Whereas that was a nifty, low-budget suspense film, set in a sci-fi/horror/race against time milieu, this is a much broader, more straightforward sci-fi fantasy film. Its bigger in scope, with more money to play with and used well on some nice effects and grand set designs. The only carry over from the first film (not essential for newcomers) is in the characters of Riddick, Jack and the holy man Imam. The film catches up with Riddick on the run, chased across planets as a payday for bounty hunters. His attempted capture leads him back to Imam, the man he trusted with his whereabouts, now apparently his betrayer. Finding him to exact rough justice embroils him in an inter-galactic conflict between peaceful residents of planet Helion Prime and a war-mongering race known as Necromongers whose leader has found a gateway to another dimension - Hell? Heaven? - and is enslaving races to make his journey complete.Its all a bit light on plot and heavy on exposition, but never less than interesting or entertaining. There are some nice action set-pieces - a prison break out and subsequent race against a 700-degree sunrise takes up much of the film's middle act - and some fairly brutal fight sequences, though nothing too bloody. And underneath it all, if you look hard enough, is a subtext about the master race and the thwarting of apparently ""evil"" regimes, even slavery. And the performances are fine. Vin Diesel clearly owes a lot to the machismo of mid-eighties action heroes, and he seems to be trying to out do them with his gruffer than gruff, bassy tones and unmovable physicality. Judi Dench, if a little out of place in something this fantastical, works wonders with some tough, Obi-Wan-esque dialogue and Karl Urban, having offed orcs in the Lord of the Rings and fought against Jason Bourne in his second film, is becoming a recognizable and very watchable addition to action across all genres. Even Thandie Newton, who is often hit and miss, makes a bid for Lady Macbeth-style, string pulling menace and pretty much pulls it off. Finally, there is some lovely eye candy for the lads in the shape of Alexa Davalos, playing the renamed Jack character, Kyra. Yummy.In the end, its perhaps not the action spectacle it seems from the trailers, but it looks great and manages to establish a new sci-fi universe fairly adequately. As such, it slips comfortably into the sci-fi middle ground previously held sway over by Star Trek and the like and a sequel would not be an unpleasant prospect. In truth, when all is said and done, it feels very much as though this film's main purpose is to broaden our understanding of the Riddick character and his past and set up his and the universe's future for a further installment. Diesel has said that that will happen, despite the film not really setting the box office on fire this summer. So, the best part of the film for me was the denouement, which lifted what had gone before to something slightly grander and asked a question which only a sequel could really answer.Lower your expectations and go expecting some nice visuals and you may well be pleasantly surprised. Its not as well-established as the similar (in scope) Star Wars franchise, but is far grander in scale than the shooting fish in a barrel stylings of Troy. And there are some decent punch-ups to boot.",The Chronicles of Riddick
210,glen-88,All the powers in the universe cant save this schlock.,1,14 November 2004,"I wanted to like this movie. I really did. Pitch Black made for a good rental but this haphazard over-hyped piece of space poop sequel did little to make me want to see the rest of the ""Riddick Trilogy"" the director wants to do. The plot was cliché at best and down right retarded at worst. Characters were of course one dimensional and most were pretty pointless. The effects while decent do little to change the fact that this movie's script sucked, I shudder to think that any actor would have read it and said ""Hey this looks good!""Several holes are left throughout the story and the whole thing just felt like Hollywood trying to capitalize on a big epic themed movie, ala LOTR but, you know, without all the meaning and depth.Don't EVER SEE THIS FILM UNLESS you want something to throw your popcorn at.",The Chronicles of Riddick

I lament how we undervalue a multi-layered story and Hollywood caters to the intellectually least of us when they make a lot of SiFi. If the characters don't have convincing motivations to fight you don't have a good story. I think the people who don't like this film can't appreciate all the factions and their motivations. I could understand every choice the major and minor characters made and that is amazing in any kind of story telling. It is the very reason people study Shakespeare.

212,Spartan_234,My all-time favorite movie!,10,13 July 2005,"I have seen ""The Chronicles Of Riddick"", and it was a blast. This movie has the BEST futuristic setting and computer-generated special effects ever. The action is non-stop, and it makes its 2 hours seem like just 30 minutes. Vin Diesel is at his best as the escaped convict Riddick, and Colm Feore is just brilliant as the bad guy Marshall. I just don't see why other people (including critics) were hating on this movie...the PG-13 rating, I guess? (The original Pitch Black was rated R, but that's no excuse to hate this movie.)Pop it into your DVD player and press Play, and action fans will have an awesome time from beginning to end. If you're not an action fan, however, at least you'll be pleased by the amazing visual effects. A definite 10 / 10 to this one!",The Chronicles of Riddick

214,north-julie,Underrated and entertaining action fest,8,3 June 2005,"The Chronicles of Riddick is an example of a film that people have heavily criticised before even seeing the film. People went to see it expecting a Pitch Black sequel, but what they got was an action film that they didn't understand.Riddick himself is a very intriguing character. Vin Diesel will never win an Oscar portraying a serious character in a period film, so letting him portray a f**ked up convict capable of killing a hundred men without pausing for thought was an ideal piece of casting. He plays Riddick well, looking menacing in every scene, and easily spitting out his one liners. He has a strong physical presence as well of course, and looks comfortable in every fight scene. One minor gripe is that when with Alexa Dyvalos (Kyra) he looks slightly uncomfortable.On the plot front, the 'all conquering army marching across the galaxy destroying everything in its way' is a tried and trusted formula, working as well as it can here. The next target for this army, Helion, is presented as a religion fuelled world, and contains one of the only links to Pitch Black. Keith David returns as the Muslim preacher Imam, and is promptly killed off. Riddick avenges his death, but is captured by the Necromongers (crap name) and taken to become part of this army. When it is found out that he is a Furion (another crap name) the order is given to kill him.The problem with all of this is that the makers of this film have tried to hard to come up with snappy clever titles to represent key parts of the film. Firey planet Crematoria obviously represents crematorium. Furion is a link to Riddicks anger (fury) and necromonger is a link to- well its just a crap name really. And therein lies another problem- overproduction. The effects are stunning, particularly during the Necros assault on Helion at the beginning, but sometimes you feel that the 100 million dollar budget has been spent on the effects, and that they picked someone up off the street and let him write the script. This has an effect on the performances as well.Judi Dench is wasted as the chief elemental, saddled with so much scene setting dialogue that she might as well have been called Mrs exposition. Colm Feore tries hard to be menacing, but he comes across as a bit of a weasel. He overacts as well, making the Lord Marshall as camp as a power rangers baddie. Physically he fits the role, which is shown in his duel with Riddick at the end. Alexa Dyvalos is average, trying hard to be as fucked up as Riddick but falling short. The romance between her and Riddick is wisely blunted and shown only through glimpses, as it would be look odd with those two together. Keith David brings some much needed weight to the film, and his death is a sad moment. Even though he is here for only twenty minutes, he lasted the duration of Pitch Black and was a very fleshed out character.The action is in places excellent, and places poor. The assault on Helion is awesome, and the sprint over crematoria dramatic and reaches a well staged finale. The end fight between Riddick and the Lord Marshall is fun, but in places choppy editing ruins any cohesion and excitement. The fight against the necros on Crematoria before the sun hits the ship hanger is a victim of this, and turns into a boring game on counting how many different camera shots are used.Flaws in the film include the overproduction, poor in places in script and some less than impressive performances. Otherwise this film is underrated and enjoyable.Before I wrap this up, there are some questions raised by the film. Why do most of the characters have ridiculous names like Irgun, vaako and Kyra, while Vin Diesel plays someone called Richard? Can a bottle of water really beat the effects of the sun and stop someone from being melted? And what exactly is the point of those tiger/lion things in the crematoria sequin's?",The Chronicles of Riddick
215,wiredrabbit,A bloody fine waste of a couple hours,8,16 June 2004,"If you like Diesel, or XXX then this is probably a movie for you.  I have to say a refreshing take on sci fi and action flicks.  Yes, the genre has been done and it does remind one a bit of Arnie, but honestly, that isn't that bad a comparison.  It was fast paced, the art was very cool - actually I'd say it was quite good for that alone - and the costumes were absolutely great.  Vision of Geiger and some really dark fashion rather than the pseudo gamer garb that is so popular these days.  Some of the feeling was quite Dune like as well, also a movie with excellent art direction.I personally did not like the style of the cinematography as it tended to be very dynamic with a style that reminded me of everything I hate about ""On Her Majesties Secret Service"".  I'd rather see the action on the screen move about than the camera.  It did, however, add to a dynamic feeling once it settled down.  The effects were nice as expected, but in a refreshing change were not just more Matrix knock offs.  You do have to give up any preconceptions of physics you might have and sometimes you just wonder why they did something totally stupid.  Still, all said, a good example of an adventure flick and a better one than has been out for a while.",The Chronicles of Riddick

I didn't even know that there was a movie before this one. This movie still makes perfect sense. It has a good story, lots of good acting, and really cool special effects. Granted, there are some places that they could improve on like some of the dialogue because at some places, it was kind of cheesy.

Pitch Black was quiet compared to this.  I have to give credit to the writers though, they know how to write a good story.  Please remember though, this is a sci fi/fantasy flick.  It's purpose is to be wild and outrageous.  The first one is different in that Riddick was one of a few main characters in the story, but given his success, do NOT be surprised that this second one is all about him.  I do like the fact though that they included the survivors of the first movie, which is pretty much the only link to the first movie there is.  Other than that, this movie has quite enough strength to stand alone.  I'm seriously glad that Vin D. has another good movie under his belt.",The Chronicles of Riddick
218,wildwesth,Instant Classic,10,5 March 2006,"Just saw this film on TV. Didn't watch it in the theaters because the trailers looked like another hackneyed version of Dune, Pitch Black gone awry on an overblown budget. Boy was I wrong. The marketing on this film was sadly misleading.What a fine Science Fiction, a fine motion picture in the classic sense of great entertainment and morality play. The story borrows from the John Carter of Mars series (""You keep what you kill...""), Shakespeare, Greek Drama (Eadipus), Spartacus, and Rambo. Edgar Rice Burroughs was a true artist of literature, his prose poetic in the midst of bloody battles that even today would warrant an ""x"" rating. This film reflects the best of that tradition. It respects its audience by working every detail with such great care and effort that we as the audience feel we have been given a gift.Although these are two completely different science fiction films, I haven't had that feeling of artistic integrity since Star Wars episode 4, back in '77.The film shows the transformation of a disenfranchised warrior into a great hero. Special effects are of the highest caliber. Writing, direction and acting all superb. There are familiar trends through the film, but weaved in a new tale which is totally engaging. Nice touches of humor and fine direction keep this believable. The parts that are silly are so on purpose. If you are a little older you will laugh at the ""back of the bus"" references, and the classic Greek drama told with all the best histrionics. It seems that the antagonist could only be played by Vin Diesel. We would also like to see him work his remarkable dramatic talents in murder mystery as well. He is the rightful heir to Humphrey Bogart, as Harrison Ford was to Gary Cooper. Bogey in Casablanca has Vin all over it: funny, cynical, but in the end, courageous, and completely believable.",The Chronicles of Riddick

The nightmare would be if this where considered part of a new franchise.The plot is minimal. The effects are nothing new, but despite the budget have a low rent feel. If, part way through, you feel the need to go the fridge and get a beer (and you will), you won't bother to press ""pause"" on the remote.Maybe the very least attractive element of the film is the physical appearance of Dame Judy Dench. Parts of her face appear to have become 10 years younger. But not all of it.

Every single scene with Riddick shows Riddick doing some he-man macho stuff followed by a predictable one liner.Really, i'm not talking ultracool like in ""Die Hard"" or ""Lethal Weapon"", but extra mega ultra hyper cool to the max and then some! This movie stretches the one-dimensional character as far as it can. It's so over the top, that it's just obnoxious. In one scene, wolf-like beasts attack and devour some inmates. Except for Riddick of course, when one beast approaches him, it affectedly curls up and Riddick pets it like it's a dog. To which Riddick comments ""hey, it's an animal-thing..""

Geiger meets Dune meets Cat in the Hat. They obviously really care about what they are doing too as there is lots of back story alluded to with loads of clever design in the background that you never see more than once. Check out the planet projecting device and see if you can figure out how it is supposed to work. I figure it is all done with sound waves, hence the peaks of constructive interference beneath the planets. Clever stuff. The soothsayers are pretty funky too. The black smog intake on the space craft was interesting too. Interesting to consider that here we are at a time when Disney reveals that it has made its last cel-animated film. There was a time a few years ago that animation was considered dead, and now with big budget epics like this you have to wonder if 50% of screen space is actually made of animated backdrop. What new wonders we live to see!Can you guess which character I hate though? You will too, don't worry. Kyra - Man, that girl was weak. I get so fed up with the feisty, untamed love interest schtick. It's only there for the 16 year old boys and ranks right up there on the Jar Jar Binks scale of annoying sidekicks. Why oh why oh why!

Opening sequence tells pretty far what is the movie style.. and it's good. Okay, have to admit that the bounty hunters were pretty stupid but don't worry they will get what they deserve. Extra points to future war scenes (bombing etc) founded in the movie what were nicely filmed and recorded. Blot includes also this major dominating race and couple of fancy ""ghost like"" characters but i won't reveal anymore.Like the first movie ""COR"" presented unique filming and fancy colors. Camera angles and cutting of the film tells that ""something different"" is tried to make, and succeeded there pretty well. I think script had something borrowed from Dune but it still was refreshing and appealing in many ways comparing what we have usually seen in movies of this genre. Vin Diesel had regain his cool image after boring XXX and was beating the bad guys with a bad ass attitude. Don't take me wrong there is more than just beating and shooting in this film but scifi action with attitude was the red line here and I like it that way.

This movie is a tasty, artery choking grilled cheese that satisfies once you get into it.  Don't mistake it for what it isn't trying to be.  I doubt if it will win any academy awards for acting but it held my attention the whole time and I wanted more as I left the theater.  Good special effects. Interesting story that is actually more interesting than some of the cartoonish sounding names in it would suggest ('Necromongers','Underverse','Elementals', 'Furians', etc...).  And of course there is plenty of action and violence. All of it very well done with usually a pleasant unexpected twist to it somewhere.In the end I would definitely recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a good sci-fi action film.  This definitely isn't the best sci-fi film ever made but I don't think you will be disappointed.Cast: Decent enough.  Vin Diesel seems to be made for the tough-guy who doesn't talk much role.Cinematography: Well done.  CG could have been a bit sharper but the design of the costumes and 'look' of the film more than make up for any technical defects.Story/Plot: Interesting.

There is poetry in its brutal phantasm, and it gets better and better with every viewing. I have watched it over 20 times now, and I'm in complete awe of its otherworldly context. And yet, as bizarre as the Necromonger Empire appears to be, it exists in an orderly and consistent universe that pits human consciousness against both artificial and animal intelligence in a terrifying -- albeit highly entertaining -- lexicon. The cast is as top-notch as David Twohy's screenplay and direction, with Vin Diesel delivering a Riddick one could hardly anticipate from Pitch Black.

I enjoyed the fighting, escaping, steel-hide wolves, spaceship battles, stunning landscapes, locations, the story and the flow of how the director put all of these things together. This was not a ""make me think"" film and was never intended as such. It was an escape for about two hours. A great escape at that.

I would go see this movie again, which is really high praise from me.  This movie looked good, sounded good, and felt real.  I enjoyed the sci-fi elements, like the radar/spotter men, the weapons, and the deployment of troops.  I thought Vin Diesel did a good job, as did Judy Dench and Karl Urban.  The only bad part to me was some of the names used for the different worlds.  This movie seemed influenced visually by the original Dune, which despite it's numerous flaws is still one of my favorites.  I would compare this movie to Aliens, which though not perfect either, is another great sci-fi/action movie.  I would give this movie a 7/10.",The Chronicles of Riddick
230,AdamWhite1421,Bad. Really bad.,6,3 September 2004,"A prime example of style over substance. It felt like they spent so much money on the special effects (which were very good most of the time) that they forgot to think about the plot. Pitch Black was an amazing film, but Riddick was only one of the stars. I understand that everyone thought he was amazing but I don't feel he warranted his own spin-off of this size.The movie itself was full of holes, there was very little explanation of who the bad guys were or what this (really badly named) Underverse was. It was action by the numbers with a story bolted on just because they had to, but even the action sequences were a bit lame. It felt like it was a Schwarzenegger film from the 80's, which were good then but the times have moved on and audiences want more than just mindless action these days. ...and finally, what a really bad ending! Cheesy, disappointing and really really bad.If I didn't like Sci-fi action films so much this could have got a really bad score. As a movie fan I recommend you avoid it if you can as there are better ways to spend 2hrs.

231,RaziaK,A thinking movie; one of the best sci-fi films.,10,17 November 2004,"Warning: There are some details of the film here but no major spoilers.I enjoyed this film. It is beautiful and thoughtfully constructed with many different worlds, each a story on its own. I will not be surprised if this film gains a cult following, but that may take time, because this is a complex, multi-faceted film. It is a gorgeous sequel to Pitch Black, and ties in the plots and different character development very well. In order to fully appreciate this film, the viewer has to be somewhat familiar with Pitch Black (PB), religions and spiritualism.At the start of the DVD, there are two choices: Convert or Fight. This phrase sums up the spirit of the fight in the story. The Necromongers are a warmongering race, bent on converting the peoples they conquer. The Necromongers believe death is a final phase, and use death and destruction as their religious justification. Their armour and masks are suggestive of Roman gladiators. When the Lord Marshal first makes his appearance, the stage is like a gladiator arena filled with scared families and worse things follow.In Pitch Black, we got to know the gritty parts of Riddick's childhood. COR explains his origins in Furyan planet. We also come to know who had ravaged his planet and his family. It neatly ties into the Prophecy of the Necromonger in COR. The setting on Helion Prime is suggestive of Islamic culture. The settings look like a futuristic Prince of Persia game. The Helion's fighter plane has Arabic script scrawled with a marker on it. From the decor on the doors, drapes, clothes, New Mecca city also has a fragment of the Kaba rock. It is a city with many diverse cultures living together. There are sounds of 'salam' and the mosque azans. The Necropolis has beings that neither eat or drink, much like fasting. They are reminiscent of the psychic beings on the Minority Report.Diesel was his usual charming and thunderous self. Diesel is a Furyan; the simmering rage, the brute force, and husky voice make up the character. We get to see more emotion from Riddick in this story. But other characters were just as dominating. Thandia Newton playing Dame Vaako was absolutely stunning. Her sinuous walk, hissing orders like Lady Macbeth to her husband was a strong sub-Shakesphearen story. Kyra (also the super-thief on Angel) excellently expressed her rage and frustration at her life. An unexpected change from the little, shy girl in Pitch Black. Some critics had sad she resembled a young Ripley from Aliens; she played a fiesty fighter in a subterranean world quite similarly.COR sets the tone for a Part 3 very nicely. There are hints that the Furyan world will be further explored, Riddick's 'keep what you kill' situation, and what of the Necromonger faith? Riddick, once a baby that was almost strangled to death with his umbilical cord, has become something that he could never imagined in his wildest dreams. I cannot wait for Part 3.",The Chronicles of Riddick
232,Virgil2127,"More ""downs"" than ""ups""",6,13 June 2004,"(Unavoidable SPOILERS)The follow-up to the moderately popular ""Pitch Black"", a movie that first introduced audiences to the deep-voiced Vin Diesel, ""Chronicles of Riddick"" tries to show off more of its richly stylized science fiction universe. Unfortunately, like a smoke and mirrors magician, many parts of this story are for show only.To compare this movie to the works of Lucas, Roddenberry or even Tolkien is a grave injustice. I didn't see this movie expecting to be enbroiled in a deeply thoughtful plot. I planned to watch a fun action flick, and even for that, I was still a little disappointed. Part of the problem with Chronicles of Riddick is this universe isn't fully-realized, so the quirks, motivations and even physical abilities of certain characters remain in question throughout the entire movie. For example, the dreaded villain of the piece is Lord Marshall (Colm Feore). He has journey too and from a never-explained religious concept known as ""Underverse"". His character remains an engima at best from start to finish. The only part of his personality we are familiar with is his arrogance, which allows two of his underlings to scheme about his demise Macbeth-style. His powers are also wickedly undefined. He can move like the Flash on acid and also has the awful ability to rip out people's souls. This inability to define Marshall's power makes fighting him a real pain in the last scene.The only time this movie really succeeds is when the movie's title character, Riddick, is allowed to be Riddick. Whether when he's fighting Marshall's Necromongers or slacking off in a prison, his character is nevertheless endearing in his solitary independence and intelligence. Thus, the first three-forths of the film is filled with Riddick's daredevil deeds and his non-chalant reactions to his situation. Riddick is joined by Kira (Alexa Davalos), a girl who posed as a boy named Jack in ""Pitch Black"", and who entirely idolizes Riddick. Kira is a sexy and energetic re-tooling of a previous character, although I actually question the need to change her name from Jack to Kira. The name of Jack gave her an interesting sense of sexual ambigouity. Here, as Kira, her identity is definitely female but nevertheless conflicted. With the exception of Dame Judi Dench, every member of the supporting cast who has a chance to out-act or out-stage Diesel dies by the end of the film. Thus, the respectful supporting cast of this film is nearly decimated by the film's end. Since this is done so much, we really don't full anger for Lord Marshall or sadness for Riddick. We just feel really numb. And that's what makes the pseudo-cliffhanger even more questionable. How is this movie expected to lift itself into a franchise when so many of the characters are dead? Riddick is a fine character, and I would love to see him in another film, so long as it doesn't resemble this one.2 out of 4",The Chronicles of Riddick
233,thanna-1,Fabulous!,10,22 June 2004,"As a sci-fi/action buff I was originally taken in by the movie Pitch Black when it came out on tape... wow, the first real good sci-fi since the original Alien and Aliens(2) movies from the late 70's and 80's. It was also better than Independence Day. Pitch Black was the first movie I seen with Vin Diesel, who I think is today's new action star to replace past headliners growing to old to perform such movies. My second Vin Diesel movie was The Fast and the Furious, a good movie for people who love cars - like me. xXx was my next Vin Diesel movie, and again no regrets - another 10 for Vin. Most sequels bomb, but The Chronicles of Riddick more than fulfilled my hopes of it being a good movie - it was fabulous. I thought the special effects and sound was great, the acting was great, the cast of quality stars was great, and the story line and plot was overwhelming. 2 thumbs up in my book, and I will recommend it to all of my friends.

236,stevegc,Conan the Barbarian meets Macbeth,7,15 June 2004,"So I am watching the credit roll for the movie The Chronicle of Riddick and I am wondering why I loved this movie so much.  And then it hit me.  This is the sequel to Conan the Barbarian that Conan the Destroyer was supposed to be.  Did I loose you? Conan the Barbarian is one of my favorite movies and Conan is one of my favorite characters.  Riddick is more true to the character that Robert E. Howard created than the movie Conan the Destroyer ever was.  And of course Conan the Destroyer could never be redeemed because Arnold left the franchise because he didn't want to become a one trick pony. Vin Diesel also shies away from sequels.  He refused to do another Fast and Furious or Triple X and would only do a sequel to Pitch Black once he was made producer of the film.  Shying away from sequels is another lesson he learned from the master  Arnold. And in Vin Diesel's defense, this movie isn't really a sequel to Pitch Black.  It picks up where Pitch Black left off but it goes into a completely different direction.  They establish a mythology early on in the Chronicles of Riddick that helps set the tone for the new movie and move it away from the gimmick of Pitch Black. The main similarity between Conan the Barbarian and the Chronicles of Riddick is IT'S THE SAME STORY!  The story arc between the villain and the anti-hero is exactly the same -- except they left the scene with the steamy orgy next to the boiling caldron of human body parts out of this movie to get the PG-13 rating. The other thing they left out was the snappy dialog that made the Conan movie so campy.  I mean who can beat James Earl Jones, arguably the greatest voice ever, belting out lines like `Now they will know why they are afraid of the dark!' and `They shall all drown in lakes of blood.' The story lines aren't just shockingly similar they are exactly the same. In Conan, Thulsa Doom sweeps the land destroying everything in his path with the purpose of building a new religion unto himself.  In the process, he destroys Conan's village thus providing Conan the motivation to become the warrior that will one day become the instrument of Thulsa's destruction. And to the credit of Conan the Barbarian, they explore this dynamic in the movie and the character, Thulsa, attempts to exploit it.  This dynamic is sorely missing from Riddick. In Riddick, the Lord Marshall, doesn't quite have the same ring as Thulsa Doom, sweeps the universe destroying everything in his path with the purpose of building a new religion unto himself.  Yada, yada, yada. Where the movies are different is in how the anti-heroes are played. Riddick is a little self-aggrandizing whereas Conan has a little humility. In Conan's world, Conan seeks the favor of the gods whereas Riddick is too much of a rebel to bow to any such notion.  The world view that there are gods worthy of tribute makes Conan a more grounded and thus more sympathetic anti-hero. Not only does the movie lift from Robert E. Howard's Conan the Barbarian, it lifts strait out of William Shakespeare's Macbeth.  There is a minor story arc with Mission Impossible: 2's Thandie Newton and Lord of the Rings Rohan Warrior Eomer.  Thandie is constantly attempting to manipulate the situation to position her husband as the new king, eh, Lord Marshall.  But again the dialog falls short.  Instead of `Out, Out Damn Spot' we get something like `wait, that wasn't supposed to happen.' In summary, if you like Conan meets Macbeth, then you will love this movie. I certainly did!",The Chronicles of Riddick
237,mr_movie_2004,Very good action adventure,8,11 June 2004,"To begin, you should see Pitch Black before watching Riddick. Undoubtedly this film will shatter Pitch Black's performance at the box office and a large number of people will see this without seeing the original Riddick movie which would be a mistake. On to the review. This is without question a film that will polarize audiences. To begin with there were a large number of people who wanted to dislike this movie. Some people wanted to dislike it because it was the mega-budget follow up to the modest, small scale cult favorite Pitch Black. Others because they hate Vin Diesel. Then again, there were a great deal of people heavily anticipating it because they loved Pitch Black and the Riddick character, or because they like grandiose sci-fi movies. So before the film was even released, a lot of people had already for the most part formed their opinion. I layed somewhere in the middle of these two camps, as someone that enjoyed Pitch Black who was somewhat skeptical about how the character of Riddick would transfer into an epic story. I can't say that I was disappointed.The film might not have the most original plot, but there is not much in the realm of science fiction that hasn't been done time and time again. Also, this movie doesn't make excessive attempts to be deep or philosophical unlike, say, the contemporary Matrix which failed as often as it succeeded in that regard. Sure, there are some underlying themes about faith, the dual nature of religion, destiny and the whole MacBeth inspired plot line, but these things are not force fed to the audience as the movie plays out. And finally, the plot is somewhat complex as far as the history and mythology involved, although it is not very hard to understand. Even so, I've seen several reviews already that featured complaints about a lack of understanding for certain things, such as why Riddick went to the slam. This is clearly explained in the film and should be evident to anyone who actually watched it, even if they didn't catch the actual explanation. The long and short of it is that this film set out first and foremost to to entertain. It wasn't so much about character development and excessive drama as it was about action and adventure. In my opinion it succeeded in providing a good time, watching Riddick kick butt in front of a grand atmosphere. While some might dislike it for the same reason, I applaud Twohy for not attempting to be too ambitious in terms of drama. In most films like this, the attempts at drama end up being so heavy handed and sappy that they make you cringe. In this one, the only truly emotional moment was fairly honest and well done. Much more would have been too much to ask. Afterall, Vin Diesel is cool when he's fighting and shooting, and is entertaining when shooting off the Arnold, Stallone-esque intentionally cheesy one-liners, but an actor capable of extended dramatic scenes he is not. So it isn't the second coming of Star Wars or Alien. But it's still a very good and entertaining take on sci-fi action. Twohy creates a stunning, otherworldly atmosphere combined with a pretty interesting if not particularly original story, as well as great effects and action sequences.",The Chronicles of Riddick
238,Johnny-Sack,A MODERN DAY DUNE,1,4 December 2004,"I believe that Pitch Black was overrated. That said I still went to see this film. With the small hope that it would be an epic visual treat. Or maybe an interesting new take on the very tired sci-fi genre. Or maybe a no brain actioner. I was wrong.Horrific performances compliment flat direction. Vin Diesel does what he can, dare I say more. And Judi Dench (bess her) floats around lost in a world of rushed looking sets and half arsed action scenes.Unoriginal and completely lacking in anything remotely exciting.An extremely poor effort from what could have been quite good.ROB'S REVIEW *_ _ _ _ AWFUL",The Chronicles of Riddick
239,Hotwyre6,"Not much like the original, but still good",7,13 June 2006,"It should surprise nobody that this film would to be dramatically different than its predecessor. What Pitch Black delivered was a character driven, indie type SF thriller which created the legacy of Vin Diesel and established Riddick as the new antihero of the current age. Perhaps that is a bit overreaching, but few can deny the appeal of Riddick as a lone, cold hearted prisoner suddenly thrust into the role of leading a group of newly introduced, helpless lambs to safety. Regardless of the simplicity of the plot, it is a formula that works on an emotional level; it is not, however, a formula that can be successfully repeated in a sequel.The creators of Chronicles could obviously see that Riddick's character needed a new environment in which to shine. Transplanting him from the isolated, dead planet on the ""ghost lane"" of interplanetary travel, Riddick is placed on the high profile, heavily populated Helion system on the brink of invasion. Driven there by the need to confront those who placed a heavy bounty upon his head, Riddick finds himself once again fighting against the role of reluctant savior as the enemy invaders - Necromongers, it is revealed - sweep into the Helion system and subdue the populace despite its futile resistance. He also learns that Jack, the girl whom he fought to save in the first movie, is now held prisoner in a high security penal colony. Her name is changed to Kyra, and Riddick sets up an elaborate ruse involving his ""capture"" in order to find and recover her.The contrast is sharp, but what is noteworthy is how Riddick's character remains distinguishable as the same rogue who captivated audiences in the first film. Like all films, it suffers from certain flaws that detract from the vision of its creators. One of the first things that becomes clear is that Diesel's stunt work and martial arts choreography took precedence over that of other characters, as he and his adversaries are the only really convincing fighters. There are also some issues involving the geophysics of the planet upon which the prison he enters is built. Part of enjoying any SF film involves looking past these things, however, to see the whole of the creator's vision.Given the enormity of the task of pleasing fans of a well constructed indie SF classic, Riddick delivers reasonably well in an age of SF and Fantasy disappointments. If the viewer can avoid dissecting the film too much, it should serve as a worthy sequel.",The Chronicles of Riddick
240,Kindall,Much better than I expected,8,1 August 2005,"This film (okay, the Director's Cut on DVD) was much better than I expected. Of course, this is by now becoming a typical reaction for me to Twohy's films. In any case, this is a space opera that, unlike the Star Wars prequels, doesn't resort to spoon-feeding every little plot detail to the audience. Instead, viewers are expected to fill in some of the gaps for themselves, and while this tactic may leave some viewers behind, it makes the film much more engaging for those of us who make the effort. What exactly are the powers of the elemental Aereon? Why are the Necromongers so keen on decorating everything with scowling human faces? What is ""conversion"" really? What the heck is the underverse? You get the distinct impression that there are actually answers to many of these questions, and that just makes the movie's universe seem that much more rich and real. It's the same trick used in the best science fiction and fantasy novels and it's a rare treat to see it deployed so ably in a film from a major Hollywood studio. Okay, there are still plenty of things in it that don't really make much sense to me, but Twohy had earned the benefit of the doubt by not treating me like a drooling moron, so I went along for the ride.There are some damn fine actors backing up Vin Diesel, and while Diesel isn't quite the actor some of them are, he mostly doesn't embarrass himself. In addition, there are some amazing special effects, a number of visually striking sets, and some great action sequences. And speaking of eye candy, how about that Thandie Newton, hm? And for once, the hot chick was given things to say that weren't completely stupid. The only thing I found a bit distracting is that Colm Feore, who plays the main villain, sounds a little like the guy who does the Visa commercials when he declaims some of his lines. I kept expecting him to add ""It's everywhere you want to be!"" (For all I know, Feore might actually do those spots, though a Google search didn't implicate him.)Anyway... this was one of the few sci-fi flicks I've seen recently that actually engaged my imagination and didn't insult my intelligence. Kudos to writer/director David Twohy and the cast, who is clearly a big science fiction nerd. Is there actually going to be a sequel? If so, I'll probably go see it on the big screen.",The Chronicles of Riddick

The story might be a bit cryptic for non sci-fi heads, but it is a commendable movie with regards to its special effects, soundtrack and production design. All of which combine to create an interesting atmosphere.In terms of acting the movie's adeptly supported by Thandie Newton, Karl Urban (Eomer in LOTR) and Judi Dench. As for Vin Diesel it seems all we could expect of him is to show some biceps, look tough and deliver one sentence at a time.

244,su-49,"Entertaining, but bad Sci-Fi",7,6 August 2011,"Though the plot is too straightforward, the movie was entertaining for me anyway. May be the simplicity + decent acting + really good entourage that's what I really needed. Just a fairytale in good looking form. But...It's not Sci-Fi. No, not because of «souls thing». That's OK as an element of the fantasy/fiction. What personally annoy me much are realistic details sacrificed (unjustifiably, in my opinion) in the name of entertainment.For example, the part on the prison-planet with sharp day/night temperature drop («Crematoria» or something). How it can be possible for such planet to have atmosphere at all or at least have the chemical composition of the atmosphere suitable for men? Is such atmosphere on the Mercury or on the Venus? No. Or how to explain it logically: the same atmosphere as on Earth but in the range from -300 °C to 700 °C? When substances which we know in hard state there are fluids, the fluids — are gases, hell know what chemical reactions in the gases have place and so on. Even if we assume such completely unrealistic good for men breathing atmosphere is there, anyway it's absolutely unrealistic that people normally breathing while the rocks instantly turn white-hot on the sun. Even if the men sit in the shadows. On the planet gases don't heat (on the Earth do, as we all know)? Or it's just strictly forbidden for them to cross borders of shadows in the process of convection?I don't understand why the film makers don't bother about such flaws. It was done just for entertainment? But in the scene almost everybody has armor-like or baggy-like costume anyway. Turn the dress into some kind of spacesuits (thin and with transparent face guard — choreography and face expressions would be the untouched) and the flaw is gone. Or it was done because of lack of education? I wonder, does the advice of scientist really cost to much in the US? If be frankly it costs nothing today (there are many places and communities where you can get it for free).But why then? To mess up Sci-Fi genre? To insult our intelligence? To troll us? I don't know... It upset me much.",The Chronicles of Riddick
245,joshbaileynch,"A sprawling, incoherent mess",3,6 June 2008,"Get's a vote of three because admittedly the production design is very beautiful, but otherwise this film is a huge disappointment. Where Pitch Black (to which it is a sequel) was a simple, taut and highly effective little low budget sci fi horror this is a sprawling incoherent mess. Twohy clearly works far better when limited by a smaller budget. Here he just does not seem to know where he's going. The narrative is muddled and episodic with very little clear sense of how one scene links to the next. The performances are generally wooden with many of the cast simply looking rather embarrassed by the clunking pseudo mythic dialogue they have to spout. You'd need to be a real sci-fi fanatic to get much out of this one (other than a strong sense of irritation).",The Chronicles of Riddick
246,dingo865,"A feast of visuals, but mediocre action",10,13 June 2004,"Your typical summer blockbuster: short on story and dialogue, long on action and looks.It is a fairly entertaining movie with special effects that range from the weak (scaly cats) through the mediocre (most of the ultra-wide-angle CGI shots were extremely blurry) to the absolutely superb (the ships and all CGI hardware in general). The production design is generally breathtaking. Although not absolutely original, it does an excellent job of mixing elements of Nazi-baroque with a Gigeresque tapestry of shiny biomechanoid black-and-white.Regrettably, the dialogue is forgettable, the background legend is cliché'd, and the characters are barely more fleshed out than the 2D cardboard cutout figures set up in the lobby. The real strength of ""Pitch Black"" - a favourite of mine long before Vin Diesel was ever discovered - was that, in lieu of a decent budget, Twohy advanced the film's narrative and held the viewers' attention through character-driven miniarcs. In ""Pitch Black"" ALL the characters are in constant change and growth; by the end of that movie, all of them go through a radical change of perspectives, and all have a personal journey of redemption - or final fall into darkness. For ""The Chronicles of Riddick"", Twohy got the chance to play with a $100 mil. budget, and in the process completely forgot that strong character development can only help an action movie, not hurt it. Although one can see the germs of fascinating personalities behind the heavy costumes, the actors and actresses never get the opportunity to make the viewer CARE for them. The Lord Marshall - an ideological offspring of Hitler and Torquemada - gets too little screentime to make us hate and respect his powers enough, and hence his faceoff with Riddick lacks punch. The same applies to his rvial and second-in-command. Kyra and the imam seem to appear only to establish continuity with ""Pitch Black"" (and to supply Riddick with a flimsy motivation). One interesting exception to this is the Necromonger who saves Riddick's life on the prison planet: his dialogue is brief, but those few lines make his character more memorable than half the movie's cast put together.There are some minor flaws in logic, but the most abused aspects of this movie (why Riddick is caught by the group of mercenaries, surviving the firestorms on Crematoria etc.) are actually very well explained and, within the rules of physics that govern Twohy's Universe, are absolutely logical (for real-life inspiration, read up on the planet Mercury).There are two SERIOUS technical flaws that I found personally annoying.First, most of the action scenes are edited so fast and blurry that in many cases (e.g. the shootout in the prison office) you simply lose track of who is doing what to whom. This is supposedly done to give the audience a taste of Riddick's speed and power, but it becomes so incomprehensible that it leads the viewer to detach him- or herself from the story. You simply give up trying to understand what is happening, and just lean back waiting for the end so a wide-angle shot can explain to you who survived the confrontation. For an action scene to be visceral, it has to make you feel like you are a participant - it has to make you clench your fist and jump from your seat with tension. Instead, it just makes you reach for the popcorn.Second, Riddick's constant pull-on/pull-off of his sunglasses becomes comically repetitive by the middle, and makes some scenes look like a long Ray Ban commercial. In addition, Twohy made Riddick a bit more 'touchy-feely' than in ""Pitch Black"", and it does not suite him in this context. I wish he had retained his devil-may-care cynical sense of humor: droopy-eyed puppy-sad brooding is Stallone's specialty, and Sly is much better at it anyway.Overall, I really hope this franchise succeeds. I like Vin Diesel; I think he is a talented actor, and brings a strong presence to the screen. Similarly, Twohy (""The Arrival"", ""Pitch Black"", ""Below"" etc.) is an extremely gifted director who has an uncanny ability to transform a low budget B movie concept into a well-scripted A class flick. I truly hope they will make a third one which might combine the best of ""Pitch Black"" (strong characters with an interesting morality play) with the best of ""The Chronicles of Riddick"" (superb visual design and special effects).Overall: go and watch it! It will give you a pleasant if forgettable two hours. It is no ""Second-hand Lions"", but neither is it a tripe ""Alien 3"".",The Chronicles of Riddick
247,stephie-12,Best sequel!!!,10,25 October 2004,"I loved Pitch Black (and Vin Diesel!!) so I was greatly looking forward to Chronicles of Riddick. However, it surpassed even my expectations. Vin Diesel reprises his role as Richard Riddick, this time to battle the Necromongers, a religious cult lead by the all powerful Lord Marshall. The film starts five years after Pitch Black ended, with Riddick living on a remote ice planet, pursued by bounty hunters. The storyline is incredibly slick, effortlessly moving Riddick from this hostile environment to the Planet Helion, to meeting up again with Jack, the girl from Pitch Black (now known as Kyra) and on to challenge the Necromongers. David Twohy's directing is spot on, and Peter Cheung's effects enable you to actually feel drawn into the environments. Riddick's main adversaries amongst the Necromongers are Lord Vaako (Karl Urban), a career soldier/believer and Lady Vaako (Thandie Newton), his scheming wife (similarities to Lady Macbeth!!). However the main enemy is the Lord Marshall, played magnificently by Colm Feore. As well as the Necromongers, Riddick also has to face desperate environmental conditions. The only weak spot in the entire movie is the character of Kyra. They obviously wanted a female who was Riddick's equal as far as murdering people is concerned, but unfortunately it comes across totally wrong. Vin Diesel puts in his usual masterful performance, making this film incredibly watchable again and again.",The Chronicles of Riddick

Vin Diesel's character is a breakout performance, as is Radha Mitchell as the captain. The rest of the crew do good work, and the effects are solid. All of which makes watching 'The Chronicles of Riddick' so agonizing. The only component of the story line that actually links these films is Diesel's return to a prison planet to rescue the young girl he saved in Pitch - which is a small bit, almost a story within the story. The rest is pure nonsense, bad science fiction. To hear Colm Fiore's endless monologue, pretty much summing up the ridiculous sequel, of the 'quasi-dead'...

Ok, so you have to be a SciFi friend, especially with a liking for Farscape, Dune or Lexx. The scenery, the ideas, the action and even the one-liners are well worth it. It's been a while that I have been to a movie where the whole audience roared of laughter - especially when it was intended by the director.I won't bore you with the plot, other reviews have done a fine job with that.

It doesn't have any connection to the first film.In Pitch Black, it was about bunch of people, HUMAN, got stuck in a deserted planet. In Chronicles of Riddick suddenly they were Necromanger, Furyans, and many other strange fancy space names. It's like giving a Star Wars sequel to the movie Alien. Does not fit.I couldn't believe that it was David Twohy who wrote the script and directed the film. He did a great job in Pitch Black, but this film fell a long way from Pitch Black.

There, I just wanted to officially be the first person to make this observation.Riddick still stunk, analogue or not.Sure, some people have pointed out parallels with Conrad's Heart of Darkness... or at least I think they have.

And the sets are so real. For many occasions, you can see that they haven't used green screen, but real buildings. Especially the Necromongers, they seem to be futuristic and ancient at the same time. Using guns, but also axes made them quite dark. For a moment, I thought I was watching Barbarian with Schwarzenegger, then I thought, it is kind of a Blade Runner, and I had the feeling of the new Series of Battleship Galactica.I also love movies with no happy ending. This one was kind of strange. The hero we were all relying on becomes the head of the bad guys? How sad is this!

I was expecting either very very good or very very bad. Turns out the AVERAGE of the reviews is the best indicator.The movie is an action flick with sparse dialogue. The sets are excellent, CGI is superb, there are some logic holes: the plot is OK with a nice twist at the end.What fails is basic Physics: If it's 700 degrees (on ANY scale, Farenheit, Celsius or Kelvin) you are going to cook, EVEN if you are in the shade. Second error (IMHO) flesh usually gives first NOT metal handcuffs. You'll know what I mean when the scene pops up.Other than this type of problem, it's an interesting take on the Jihad theme. Camera work is so-so: much too jumpy during fight scenes or fast moving ones.The actors are fine. So-called intellectuals (the ones who keep trying to tell you what's good for you while ignoring their own rules) moaning about poor acting are full of drak.

The acting isn't especially good, but it can't really be called bad by any means.  Diesel, as the star of the film, didn't disappoint me either.  As I'm reading the other comments on the movie, his acting is at the forefront of complaints.  I'm starting to suspect that it's primarily because it's just more fun to make fun of the rich, muscle-bound action star who's made a few big-budget films(most bad) rather than because his acting was particularly bad.  It's an action sci-fi movie, and really, I think he did a better job on delivering the dialogue and making you believe the character than I've seen in any movie from the genre in the last 5-6 years.  Possible exception, Laurence Fishburne(mostly for Event Horizon). Then of course, he delivered the action.  If there was slow-motion I would have sworn that some of the action scenes were done by John Woo.  Very chopped together and tied together with a vague sense of artistic cinematography.  I'm more of a fan of action scenes where camera placement and acting play more of a roll than editing, but that's just me. The story, thin.  I saw a comment where someone compared it to Conan, Dune, and Battlefield Earth.  Conan was the one that immediately came to mind near the end of the movie, but other than that the only other similarity is lots of fighting.  And I was reminded of Dune throughout the movie, but not with any significance since it was mainly trivial features of the movie.  Large palaces overlooking large desolate areas, different races of people that all look like humans.  The movement of the uber-powerful people was also reminiscent of Dune/Children of Dune movies.  One other paralleled story that I could see would be Dragonball Z.  Seeing Riddick/the Furians as the Saiya-jin and Lord Marshall as Furiza.  Nothing really to do with the story.  As far as the actual story goes I'd give it a B for an action movie, C for a sci-fi movie. Major complaint of the film would be a bigger finale.  Basically, everything unfolds how you'd expect it to.  No real surprises, no huge badass fights.  Maybe more flashy effects or maybe Riddick discovering something within himself would have pleased me more. Overall, this movie was good and I'd rank it up with X-men 2 for summer blockbusters that I've thoroughly enjoyed in recent years(not quite Pirates of the Caribbean).  My Rating, B.",The Chronicles of Riddick
259,rc_whittle,Solidly good looking sci-fi. Not the sharpest tool in the box but fun.,8,12 June 2004,"Pitch black left us in a spaceship with a young girl called ""Jack"" who was pretending to be a little boy, and a holy man, both rescued by our protagonist, ex-con and anti-hero, Riddick.Riddick, quite possibly the toughest man in the galaxy, starts out this movie as a wanted man, although that doesn't really seem to bother him too much as he can kill adversaries in a flash with almost no trouble at all.
Chronicles is a solid sci-fi thriller with great special effects, exagerrated costuming (particularly an ophidious Thandie Newton), and some of the most gob-smacking fight scenes since the recent ""Matrix"" movies.I have some new-found respect for Mr Diesel after this movie as he manages to capture Riddick's anti-heroism with some considerable acting skill.
If you are a fan of the Matrix films you are almost sure to find Chronicles to be a wholy satisfying little romp around the galaxy.Personally I found the premise, storyline and other content to be very enjoyable, just don't go expecting too much and you'll probably come out like me - glad to have spent the $10.8/10",The Chronicles of Riddick

We both liked the very interesting take on future society; especially, how religious fervor had such an obvious and negative effect on that future.I spoke to a theater attendant who expressed concern about the commercialization of the ""franchise"", with cheesy jokes and stunts that even the suspension of disbelief that sci fi requires, could not sustain. That was not the case. Perhaps, it is because this film is more like a first in the franchise, in that Pitch Black was of a cult ""classic"".I think another sequel is forthcoming.

There are some good knife fights, but it would've been better if Riddick used more weapons than the same knife he took of a Neckromonger or whatever there called. **Very Minor plot spoilers here** Basically, a group of evil aliens called Neckromongers are taking over the universe and will either convert a prisoner to their ways, or kill them. But of course, they'll have to deal with hard-nut Riddick first, and he's also being hunted by Mercainaries and after getting Jack (from Pitch Black, back), but for some reason Jack is now called Keira. The ending has an extremely good fight, in a set which is badly done. Although there's no real 'monsters' in C.O.R, The Neckromongers are very challenging for IL' Riddick so expect lots of cool, unrealistic but very entertaining slow mo fights. Anyone who hates this film because 'it's not as good as Pithch Black' or 'I don't like the plot' is just being stupid.This movie falls in to two genres.

I love Bradbury and other sci-fi works of fiction, and I have to admit that I've recently become a Star Wars fan. But, the only phrase that kept coming to mind when viewing this was ""ridiculous."" The story was very feeble, in my opinion, and left way too much for the audience to try and figure out. For those of us who are too stupid to understand sci-fi things without explanation, it can be very frustrating. His eyes were cool, Aereon was neat (as far as I could understand), and running from the sun was great! But, overall, I didn't feel there was much to connect with...whether characters or plots.

264,brigand13,Too smart for the average critic?,9,24 June 2004,"I honestly think that this movie just went over the heads of a lot of people (especially movie critics). I've seen it 3 times now, and I've picked up on new things every time I watched. Believe me, Chronicles of Riddick is very re-watchable and gets better with each watching. This was a very rich and detailed movie which was seeking to create a new universe against which to paint a story. Unfortunately, due to some editing to get the PG-13 rating, some of the details move past really quickly. I think that this movie is going to follow it's predecessor to a great cult status once it is released to DVD and Twohy is allowed to do a director's cut. However, even the theatrical release of this movie is most compelling.One thing to note, it is very helpful to see Pitch Black before this movie if only to set up the Riddick character and his relationship with the others in the story. It is also quite useful to see the Dark Fury animated film that has been released directly to DVD as it bridges the gap between Pitch Black and this film as well as introducing the Toombs character. I felt that this movie stayed very true to the Riddick that was created in Pitch Black, and at the same time opened up world of possibility for the character. With Pitch Black, I loved the fact that Riddick was such a dynamic character and that dynamicism is carried through in this movie. Riddick comes across as a very flawed individual who struggles with the decisions he makes- with the choice between light and dark, good and evil- as he is drawn into a web of events which are serving to shape the universe.I felt that Vin Diesel did a phenomenal job of portraying this conflict and was a perfect fit to this role. I have seen criticisms of his acting ability, but I sincerely do not understand from whence they come. From everything I have have seen he is a very intelligent man who brings exceptional depth to characters who would normally be very two dimensional and forgettable.The visuals in this movie were exceptional with some absolutely awesome sets! The Necro ships are simultaneously classic and futurific with a decidedly Deco feel. This contrasts nicely with the mid-eastern motif that is prevalent in New Mecca. The sound and score were also very well done. The FX shots were all well integrated. I especially liked the upgrade Riddick's eyes got. My biggest critique is that this really doesn't play like a summer movie. I think that Universal really jumped the gun on this one and the attempt to expand the fan base to adolescent fan-boys was a mistake. I would have positioned this movie for a November release instead and gone for the R-rating. I think that Universal really didn't understand how to handle this one, and ultimately the movie is suffering for that. The truth is that even with the cut to PG-13, Riddick is just way to dark to be a particularly ""family-friendly"" movie and that is what traditionally does well in the summer.Ultimately this is a big, smart movie that transcends the sci-fi/action genre in the same way that Pitch Black transcended the sci-fi/horror genre. It is intense, well written and well performed. And obviously all that was (as usual) wasted on the garden variety critic (most of whom are not willing to give a fair watching to a sci-fi movie anyway). This is definitely one of the best sci-fi movies I have seen in recent years and is a worthy sequel to Pitch Black. And regardless of how the critics pan this movie, regardless of it's ultimate box office success, this is a movie that will age very well. I genuinely hope that Twohy and Diesel are given the opportunity to tell the rest of Riddick's story.",The Chronicles of Riddick

Some of the initial invasion CG sequences were intriguing and well thought out.

267,prushik,Disgrace to Pitch Black,3,28 July 2010,"Chronicles of Riddick looked so good in the previews. It has good visuals, but really, nothing else. Chronicles of Riddick is the sequel to Pitch Black (Dark Fury was between them, and had CoR's flaws as well). Pitch Black was a great sci-fi thriller with horror elements and great character development. It had three scenes which I consider ""truly great"" (an honor very few films receive, most have 0 ""truly great"" moments, even if I consider them great movies). CoR is a weird Sci-Fi film that tries to be a cult film, it picks up the story after Pitch Black, and destroys it. In Pitch Black, Riddick is a ruthless murderer, in CoR he is the last remaining of a once great alien race, destined to save the world, tell me that was planned when they made Pitch Black. CoR tries way to hard to be the next Star Wars, and totally fails. The story is extremely hard to follow, very choppy, confusing, and too complicated for a single film. There was no set up for it in Pitch Black, Pitch Black should stand on its own. This movie is not without merit though. Although I really didn't like it, it does have one ""truly great"" scene in it. I won't give it away, but watch this movie exclusively for the tea cup scene. If you have seen the movie, you know what I'm talking about. Don't watch this movie expecting the story to make sense. I saw this movie before Pitch Black, hated it, Watched Pitch Black (loved it), saw Dark Fury (Also hated, shows how obsessed with Japan/Anime the director is), then watched CoR AGAIN THREE TIMES, and still its an awful movie. No character development, no emotional moments, just more weird alien races (remember Pitch Black had 2 races, Humans and Creatures) and a confusing choppy story. Visuals are good, I will say that.Summary: I hate this movie for distorting Pitch Black's otherwise great story. You will probably like this movie if you are into anime (I have friends that are and they loved it). It has good visuals and the tea cup scene is enough to warrant watching the movie. Other than that, it has no good qualities.",The Chronicles of Riddick

Vin is bolstered by a large (but trackable) array of strong supporting characters who all put on solid performances.We are left wondering at the end where it could take us next - I suspect a sequel or maybe even a series is in the offing.

While not bringing anything new to SciFi, it was an enjoyable film, introducing interesting characters on an alien world, with menacing threats. Obviously low-budget, it was a necessarily simple story, which only added to its effectiveness.Which brings us to the sequel. In every way that Pitch Black was simple and streamlined, this movie is bloated and bombastic. We are treated to endless scenes of monolithic star ships landing, crashing, shifting into giant statues. The character driven interest of the first film is lost, to be replaced with uninteresting threats, unscary enemies and silly dialogue. While in the first film there are no hints of multiple 'races', we are now introduced to Furyans, Elementals, etc. Riddick is no longer the simple criminal, he is a member of an almost extinct race of angry psychopaths.

272,hoelo,This Sci-Fi is all about managed expectations..,8,12 June 2004,"After reading the reviews on here, I went into this movie with a good bit of trepidation.. Some of the reviews were so bad I was expecting something worse than The Fifth Element, which I found to be funny in places but overall, painfully bad.That being said, I was very pleasantly surprised.I don't do spoilers so don't worry.. Here's my take on the goods and bads of the movie.Good: The special effects were pretty good. There are some areas where you can tell that the backdrop is a painting (which is common in most sci-fi), but for the most part, the special effects are delivered seamlessly. The way that the Lord Marshal moves in his hyper-velocity manner was great, especially since it did NOT look like a Matrix rip-off like so many movies do now. Densch's elemental character moves with an ethereal grace that is neither overdone nor subtle; it just seems a natural affect of her form. In addition, there are some great new characters and creatures (FEEDING TIME!), some well-placed comedy that doesn't come off as XXX-style cheesy one liners.. Great action sequences and Vin Diesel plays Riddick in the same style he did in Pitch Black, which was welcome..Bad: This was a movie that had a bunch of little annoyances.. The background story where Riddick is suddenly cast as one of the few survivors of a long dead race, prophesized to save the universe.. That was pretty cheesy and really, totally unnecessary to the plot. It was an Oedipus-style twist (akin to Laius trying to stop his destiny and by his actions, guaranteeing it) that just didn't really work.. Had Pitch Black never been made, fine.. But with that, forget it. Other minor things - Riddick survives an unbelievable amount of punishment in this movie, even for science-fiction movies.. The new Jack/Kyra character.. good character - bad actress.. The initial exposition with the Imam.. a bit tiresome and a definite emotional play.. Finally, the movie didn't need to be quite so long.. I have no problem with two hour movies generally, but this movie just felt longer.. They could have done some nips and tucks here and there to keep it flowing faster.All in all, I very much enjoyed this film. I was and remain disappointed that it went PG-13 instead of R. There were numerous opportunities for some gratuitous bloodshed that we missed out on as a result (pan-away then screaming versus someone getting messed up on-screen). The end sets it up perfectly for a sequel.. Hopefully the original storyline from outside the movies will continue on and Kyra will be back, etc..",The Chronicles of Riddick

Consider yourself warned!Seriously, is there any science fiction film of the last thirty years, down to and including the Flash Gordon movie with the nifty Queen soundtrack, not ripped off by this one? Even Independence Day gets ripped off in a scene where hovering spaceships menace a planet.With a nearly Lucas-caliber disregard for physics (news flash: human bodies at 700 degrees Fahrenheit, whether in the direct rays of the sun or not, would vaporize before you could say ""This planet is named WHAT?""); a main character who is the walking, beefy definition of a Gary Stu (look it up) to the extent that he can tame giant, spiky rats just by staring them in the CGI-balls; a Lady Macbeth who shares a closet with the Borg Queen; dialogue very possibly stolen from a group of 12-year-olds playing ninja; and an ending that deserves catcalls of disbelief, this movie is saved -- even if, like the annoying Kyra, who you KNOW would get splatted in the first ten minutes of the movie if the Aliens were involved, it subsequently dies again -- only by the few minutes of Dame Judi Dench lowering herself to appear in it. And even then, her character is still saddled with a name (""Aereon"") that would go much better on a car.Thandie Newton's performance deserves special mention, because it helps you understand why the movie version of Beloved was such a flop. Her Dame Vaako is going straight to Star Trek supporting-cast hell, right along with Lwaxanna Troi. Karl Urban, who looked like a Harley dude in the LotR trilogy, fits in a bit better here, because people aren't expected to make sense.One defender of this ""movie"" asks its critics what they themselves have ever created, particularly in film.

What added to its charm was a limited budget and a script that focused as much on character as it did on atmosphere and tension.Then, 4 years later, ""The Chronicles of Riddick"" took the universe that was suggested by ""Pitch Black"" and brought it to life. The result, visually, was something of a cross between the Myst Universe and the Dune Novels with a bit of the Gothic griminess of Alien 3.Now the script probably isn't going to win any awards, but the cheesiness of some of the one-liners leads to an entertaining sci-fi yarn filled with really cool visuals and some fantastic plot elements that really draw you into the story.Judi Dench's character is wonderful and her character lends such a richness to the overall feel of the story. If a sequel is ever done, the Elementals really need to make a grander appearance.The texture of the different peoples and worlds is wonderfully unique and free of any obvious on-location shooting. The Necromongers are inky, murky and dark. Helion Prime is urban, yet ancient while the prison is so grimy you can almost taste it.Sure, the script could use some polishing, but overall, this movie is a fun, entertaining ride that never loses its appeal. The Director's Cut , though only slightly longer than the theatrical version, offers some more Riddick backstory, but without revealing too much, leaving enough of a mystique around the character that he doesn't lose his edge.While not an Oscar winner, this movie is still entertaining and a lot of fun. Definitely not a movie sci-fi aficionados should miss.",The Chronicles of Riddick
275,DanEas,Enjoyable film!,8,25 January 2008,"I really enjoyed this film. I found it immersive and packed full of action. The movie provides several interesting concepts and settings, such as the warmongering Necromongers, the use of specialized creatures as tools for things like long-range communication, telepathy, and enhanced vision, and the scorched penal-planet Crematoria. I thought it was a balanced blend of the sci-fi, action and adventure genres. The attention to detail was very good, which helped create an immersing environment. A few of the actions scenes may have been a bit over the top (for some reason, the two guys suspended on the outside of the ship at the beginning of the film was a bit far-fetched for me), but overall the action was believable. I would certainly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys sci-fi or action films, and feel it was unfairly panned by the critics.",The Chronicles of Riddick
276,DuaceMaxell,A bad movie can be a good thing,10,13 June 2004,"A lot of people I know use the first movie out of the series as a gauge for the second. I think in many ways this is accurate. The first movie had reasonable effects (capped by funding) and the second has amazing effects (with a seemingly limitless budget). Vin Diesel performs to the same degree of acting mastery and the supporting cast is...well supportive. By that I mean, Vin Diesel is purposely the main character and all others seem to fade out of the spotlight. Simply put the producers knew he would be the one to fill the seats. A few people have complained about the plot and say it is lacking but, I ask you what was the original plot of Pitch Black? When put into that perspective this has been beefed up quite a bit. For those of you that enjoyed Pitch Black and its Sci/FI roots then really you can't lose with this one. If there was one thing that possibly bugged me it would have been the change from Vin Diesels obvious mortal existence (Pitch Black) where he does show fear and concern eventually and is just good at staying on his feet. To the second movie where he seems like an untouchable GOD of war, granted a few scenes show vulnerability but the situations that have to occur for this to be an issue would be considered fatal for anyone else. Granted Riddick is a bad ass but even he would have to crumble eventually.For me Pitch Black was not a good movie but, at the same it had so many awesome components that it immediately became one of my favorite sci-fi classics. In the same way the second movie out of the series is equally lacking in certain aspects but rewards the hardcore sci-fi junky.",The Chronicles of Riddick

First I have to say that it offers some really great action, possibly the best I have seen for a long time. Nevertheless I'm rating it only with 4 of 10 because the movie was totally boring to me. It seems like it was not the intention of the producers of this movie to *tell* something to the audience but only to present some digital art - To me this is a dissipation of the possibilities of the medium ""film"" and it is by far not enough for a movie in order to be considered as ""really good"". It leaks any kind of message or deeper meaning. You won't find any complex characters here either, every character is just functional and very limited.I think this movie could be mentioned in one line with titles like ""300"". People who liked ""300"" will also like ""The Chronicles of Riddick"", but people who disliked 300 will also dislike this one.Finally I want to say that you don't have to watch ""Pitch Black"" before watching ""The Chronicles of Riddick"" in order to understand the movie, not least because there is not much to understand.",The Chronicles of Riddick

Sometimes not even documentaries are sources of reality.The movie was funny and looks like a HQ story, with a lot of fantasy, good visual aspects (I loved the way the invasion in a planet started) and some good action scenes.The first movie was ""ok"" too, although I was waiting for a bad one since I don't like actors like Vin Diesel, but at the end was a good surprise.It is not the best action movie ever made but is not boring as ""Van Helsing"" was.",The Chronicles of Riddick

The special effects are not there to impress the audience , but to dress up the stage in a grand theatrical fashion.The plot is great! I for one am glad that they did not extrapolate the previous movie, but introduced a whole new adventure on its own just like it was done with Mad Max followed by the Road Warrior.This movie is not pretentious, it is not here to explore human emotions and motives to the depth, it all about survival in the most extreme conditions. I like the main character because he is a walking contradiction: he's overconfident without being arrogant, he's egocentric without being selfish.I think the movie is very enjoyable and it has a surprising ending.",The Chronicles of Riddick

Originally The Chronicles were supposed be about the time Riddick spent in Jail. There were also supposed to be three movies not one condensed one. Why did he change his focus, Pitch Black was awesome but it would have been your average sci-fi movie had it not been for Vin Diesel's character. Pitch Black was about aliens but the person we all wanted to know more about was Riddick thats why the next supposed three were going to be made. The movies were probably given the veto buy the studio but still, I wanted so much more. The plot was average, the action a little better than average, the illumination of the key characters..disappointing..very disappointing.

Taking up the ""alien"" theme once more and creating a movie where people mostly run and scream.. Well its been seen before.So when i watched Cronicles of Riddick it wasn't with the biggest hopes sat for this film. But i was gravely mistaken.The plot, the story everything is perfect. Especially as the writers hasn't used any parts of any other sci-fi / space adventure movies like ""warp speed"" or stuff like that. This one has its own completely closed universe, and what a universe that is.Okay, maybe some of the story like the ""messiah"" part could have been in a different way, but still its a great film to watch.The plot is very good, and everything is explained to you. Some things like the technology is not explained but you get the idea as you go along, which makes the movie even better. Cronicles of Riddick could be the next ""dune"" and the reason for me comparing these two are that Dune also does not use elements seen before. Everything is brand new, as in Cronicles of Riddick. This is why the movie primarily is so great to watch.Riddick. Well Riddick is a one man army, and a bit on the psychopathic side. He got some skills, but still he reveals feelings in this movie. The story of Riddick could be put into a lot of good movies and sequels especially if one where to make a pre-story movie that would take place before ""Pitch Dark"".This one is one to watch!!",The Chronicles of Riddick

This is good, unpretentious, slickly made, kick arse Sci fi. Great cast, and apart from the stunningly wooden performance by Karl Urban as Vaako, all the performances were solid. Vin Diesel in particular is as fun as ever, and has a certain wisecracking Hellboy quality to him. Judi Dench and Colm Feore in particular were excellent. By the way... Judi Dench? In a sci fi? With Vin Diesel? Brilliant :) The special effects are beautiful, and the actions sequences are awesome to behold. I loved the plot. Not the most original, but the important thing was, it was done WELL. Unfolded well. You could tell David Twohy and Vin Diesel were having a lot of fun with this, and rightly so. It's ballsy, big, bold film and rocked my socks off. Pitch Black was great for what it was, this was an unexpected and brilliant direction to go for the next film. I love the both of them. And believe me, I am VERY discerning in my Sci Fi - There's a lot of pretentious crap out there!

There's only action here,there's not a lot of story and if you didn't watch ""dark fury"" before you won't even understand why everyone seem to know Riddick as most of the characters are introduced in the animation movie. I personally think that the evil necromongers had a great design but looked far too weak for an army that would conquer the universe or maybe it was Riddick that was a little bit too good, anyway they looked very easy to beat and this won't make them remembered.If you want a good action-packed entertaining movie Chronicles of Riddick is great if you are looking for more you'll be disappointed.",The Chronicles of Riddick

286,silverknife,Twohy succeeds in creating a fantastic new sci-fi world,8,12 June 2004,"You'll see reviews of all different sorts for this movie. Many will praise it, and many will denounce it. This is a film that you should see for yourself to decide. Just be sure to watch it with an open mind and not let yourself conform to the opinions of others. Oh, and I do recommend seeing Pitch Black before seeing Chronicles of Riddick.Vin Diesel turned down roles in the sequels to both The Fast and the Furious and XXX, but he's doing everything he can to bring his character Riddick from Pitch Black out as much as possible. There's a reason for this, I think. Riddick is not your typical hero central character. He's not even your typical anti-hero. There's always more to learn about him, which I think is a big part of what makes him so interesting. However, Riddick is definitely an acquired taste. Speaking for myself, I have definitely acquired this taste.Now, before you go labeling me 'fanboy' or whatever such nonsense you can think of in that regard, hear me out. Please.Having seen Pitch Black a few times and playing the Xbox game Escape From Butcher Bay, I've seen a lot more of the Riddick character than a lot of people. The Chronicles of Riddick expands on this character a little bit, but more importantly it expands on this universe that director David Twohy has envisioned quite a lot. We learn a lot more about this fantastic world, and it keeps getting more and more interesting.Vin Diesel is at his best in this movie, and the rest of the cast isn't bad either. The environments, visual effects, and creative atmosphere in Riddick are absolutely astounding and very fitting to the story. Twohy's imagination knows few bounds, if any. The movie's action sequences are definitely a highlight, as they are extraordinarily intense and many times unconventional, like the tea cup (you'll see). It's amazing how such a grand epic film squeezed into 2 hours of run time. Supposedly the original cut is much longer (I heard 50 minutes longer, but that's speculative).Riddick's only real downfall isn't as bad as I thought it would be, and that is its editing for PG-13. I would much rather see the R-rated film that it was supposed to be, but even at PG-13 it's pretty extreme. It doesn't feel much like a PG-13 movie either. Riddick pushes PG-13 to its limits with plenty of disturbing and/or gory scenarios. I'm very much looking forward to a director's cut DVD release that shows it more the way it should be.Overall, The Chronicles of Riddick is a great movie for sci-fi fans, action fans, and most of all fans of Riddick himself. You don't even have to like Vin Diesel. Riddick and Caparzo (Saving Private Ryan) are his only characters I've ever liked. Vin has definitely earned more respect from me after seeing this film.My IMDb score: 9 out of 10",The Chronicles of Riddick
287,irvingchris,"It looks and sounds just like any well-oiled machine, but lacks any human parts for us to connect with",5,12 June 2004,"I'm a sucker for films like this, or any sci-fi epic that concerns a muscle-bound brute faced with an impossible task that tests his morals and provides endless opportunities for witty one-liners. There's also no shortage of digital effects and impressive CGI landscapes here. Vin Diesel would seem the perfect candidate for a concept like this. He's the millennium's answer to the Stallone of the 80's and Schwarzenegger of the 90's.Riddick, the lone nut convict from ""Pitch Black"" with the sometimes useful ability to be nocturnal is back, facing a crusading army called the Necromongers who are bent on converting every human life to a race of fascist-like dummies. I had stop myself from trying to answer why these crusaders destroy planets they might have to one day inhabit, that is, if they plan to convert ""everyone"".This ""unholy crusade"" leads Riddick on the run, and unfortunately, that's about it. One thing I was rather confused by was the movie's lack of purpose for him. The story begins on a chilly ice world where Riddick outsmarts some bounty hunters, then follows him to a New Mecca where he witnesses the first of the Necromongers invaders. When Riddick runs again it's to the underworld prison on a fiery planet that looks like the inside of a meat grinder. The sets are impressive but a little overbearing. The acting is about as good as it gets for a movie like this, but with such little story impact it would have helped to be better. There are whole characters here that don't seem to have purpose, including Judi Dench as a sort of elemental spirit. Each new character held promise in their introduction. Instead of applying them with the slightest creativity, all we get are fierce showdowns of brute strength that are nowhere near as interesting as the conflicts in the first film.Unfortunately we've reached a peak for these kinds of films. Audiences have been blown up too many times by massive armies of marching metal like we see here. After the panning vistas of the ""Lord of the Rings"" it's just too boring to sit through yet another crusade of endless battles.It's disappointing not to be able to recommend this movie because Riddick's nature so often contradicts itself. The first film found a use for him that this movie only seems to be searching for every now and then. I thought more could have been made of the bounty hunters who are also running from the Necromongers. Wouldn't Riddick be a good candidate for leading other convicts into battle?It seems obvious that Riddick 3 (or maybe The Further Adventures of Riddick) will be in order, and hopefully by then the murkiness of this film can help be brought into the light. Riddick's dark worlds have so much potential.",The Chronicles of Riddick
288,shaofutzer,Not as bad as you'd be led to believe...,6,8 January 2005,"It almost seems as though it's become fashionable to down this movie as of late. I'm no paid critic, but I am a huge cinema buff, sci-fi fan, and educated person and the only thing that bothered me about this movie was the ridiculous nomenclature used throughout the movie(If you though Richard Riddick was bad, then think about Necromongers, Aereon the air elemental, Crematoria - a place where the sunrise will burn you to a crisp, Furia, Lord Marshal, a girl named Jack, the Underverse... you get the picture). But this reason alone is not enough to damn the movie as so many before me have seemed so willing to do (and quite vocally I must say). Is it media brainwashing, jealously of Vin Diesel by the husbands/boyfriends of giddy female fans, or are people just tired of watching one awesome action scene after another filmed on very cool sets replete with equally awesome special effects? I'm no huge Vin Diesel fan, but he's perfect in the role of Riddick and plays this happy-go-lucky seemingly indestructible dark hero character to the tee. People will down his acting ability, but what they don't realize is that his deadpan voice and seemingly emotionless face is essential to the character. If you want proof Vin can act, watch the short film Multi-Facial - in which he wrote, produced, directed and starred in. This guy can act folks - don't confuse his character in this movie or others he's been cast in with lack of talent. Spielsberg cast him in Saving Private Ryan for a reason (after watching the aforementioned short film). The action sequences are top-notch and I promise any true fan of science fiction and/or action will find this movie a fantastic joyride for the senses. What it lacks in cerebral stimulation, it makes up for with fantastic backdrops, genuinely witty one-liners, amazing special effects, and more action than you would normally cram into 10 Hollywood big-budget ""action"" movies. I don't want to spoil the movie for you - just believe me when I tell you, anyone who doesn't like this movie should be watching The Piano or Fried Green Tomatoes, because you've lost touch with what Hollywood was founded on - the spectacle. If you have the capacity to overlook the cheesy naming schemes used throughout, you will be richly rewarded with one of the most visually stunning movies ever created. Don't let Vin Diesel's previous performances in movies such as xXx or The Fast and the Furious affect your judgement - I didn't care for those movies either. Don't let the legions of aging movie critics with a vendetta against all muscle-bound actors affect your decision to watch this film. It is a sci-fi tour de force and I'm willing to put my reputation on the line by recommending it to everyone I come across, which is extremely rare indeed - and no, I'm not some giddy teenage girl or bored housewife. I'm a heterosexual 28 year old man that grew up loving horror movies, Star Wars, Transformers, and G.I. Joe (well, Cobra at least). If you have any similar background you too will love this movie just as all of my friends and I have - IF, like I mentioned earlier in this review, you can get over the silly names. All in all, while not perfect I must give this movie 9/10 points with the 1 point being deducted for (obviously) my only complaint. David and Vin, if you're reading this - please follow up with C3 and make your target audience happy - just leave the naming process to someone else. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",The Chronicles of Riddick
289,dscottcobb,Awesome cast and some great ideas poorly implemented,5,22 July 2007,"I tried to watch this 4 or 5 times as it appeared on cable. Judy Dench and Vin Diesel in the same movie? How could that go wrong? I finally realized the simple reason why I could never watch the whole thing.It's an old, old, writer's lesson: never create a universe where anything and everything can happen. If you do, you kill all suspense, and leave the audience completely bored. Vin Diesel is so bad-ass, indestructible, and physics-defying here, I have no reason to keep watching. Of course he is going to defeat every villain, inept guard, and all-destroying sun effect, so why do I even need to be there to watch it unfold? This last time it was on TV, I left during the middle, and returned for the ending, only to find a hilarious Wizard of Oz Wicked-Witch-killing ripoff. Hero defeats evil overlord, and minions bow before him. (I can't believe he didn't just use a bucket of water).And filmmakers, please, stop ripping off the Matrix.

290,Markbruinekreeft,"Not as bad as I'd expected. Somewhat entertaining even, but still a thoroughly bad movie...",4,11 April 2005,"To be perfectly honest, this film wasn't as atrociously bad as I had expected it to be at first. Granted, it's a bad movie. But at the same time I couldn't help to keep watching. Perhaps I'm just a sucker for pretty pictures. And that's just about what this whole film boils down to. The story, for one, takes an obvious backseat to the effects and the action. All there really is to it is some rehashed ""one lone hero stands between the Evil Empire and total domination"" type stuff the likes of which we've already seen countless times before. It's corny, cliché and little more than an excuse for the main protagonist (Riddick) to stab, shoot and hit people in over elaborate, gloomy settings. As for the characters, don't expect much there either. Just about all of them are walking, talking cliché's, right down to the classic ""about as dumb as he is powerful Dark Lord""-type main villain. Riddick himself also seems to have lost most of his antihero charm and has instead become more of an ""accidental hero"" kind of guy. If I had to name one single thing that kills this film as an acceptable sequel to ""Pitch Black"", it would be this. The effects themselves aren't too bad. I though the ones that completely drench the Star Wars prequels are a lot worse. Unfortunately though, they are just plain overused in my opinion. There is hardly any frame in the whole film that hasn't at least one special effect in it. As a result, everything seems overdone. Even normally quite simple devices and machines are needlessly complex, and there doesn't seem to be a single planet in the whole galaxy that hasn't got some ridiculous feature that calls for at least fifteen minutes worth of CGI. As said, the effects themselves aren't that bad, but there just are too much of them, and as a result none of them are very effective, despite their overall quality. The effects are on an unstoppable rampage throughout the entire movie, and neither the corny characters nor the meager plot line are capable of counterbalancing their presence. As for the acting; well, I do have seen a lot worse. I managed to sit through ""Star Wars: Attack of the Clones"" and believe me, that was infinitely worse. I can't say it was good either, let's just state that is was more or less adequate for the kind of film it was in and leave it at that.So; bad plot, overly garish effects that seem to hijack the whole flick and acting that never gets anywhere beyond ""reasonable"". What does that leave us with? An essentially very dumb film that, perhaps despite itself, did mange to entertain me. But this was actually more because of its exaggerated visuals and breakneck action than because of the supposedly ""epic"" story or any interesting characters. You might enjoy ""Riddick"" when you're in need of some mindless brawls and pretty pictures. But when you're hoping for a true ""Pitch Black II"", then I'm sorry, this flick certainly isn't it.",The Chronicles of Riddick

292,thewatcheruatu,doomed by faint praise,10,20 October 2009,"The 6.4 out on the front page for this film is actually misleading--it is a weighted average, which I am fairly confident is taking its skew from the 30% freshness rating this film received at Rotten Tomatoes (you'll notice the same sort of unfavorable curve on other films that were excoriated by the critical press). The arithmetic mean actually puts this film right around 7, and it's telling that almost 40% of IMDb users scored The Chronicles of Riddick an 8 or higher. Ultimately, this film has been damned by faint praise, with most reviewers feeling only comfortable enough to admit that they enjoyed it, but feeling the need to explain that they can appreciate why the critics did not. I feel no such obligation to account for why the critics didn't get this film--sometimes they're just wrong.Pitch Black was a film that I only caught on television some time after it was released. It was, as some others have said, a more intimate film, done on a small scale following B-horror-film conventions to the letter. It was, in my opinion, okay, though it didn't strive to elevate the genre in any way, and that's fine. The film floated slightly above the rest on the intrinsic, though hard-to-describe, likability possessed by Vin Diesel. I wouldn't have imagined that anything greater could come from this film or this character. The Chronicles of Riddick proved me wrong.The Chronicles of Riddick is, at its core, great science fiction, positing one of the darkest and yet most realistic universes portrayed in a sci-fi film in quite a while. This was a risky venture for the filmmakers, since moviegoers tend to prefer shiny futures in the vein of Star Trek as opposed to a future that's just as nasty and brutish as the world in which we currently live. Ultimately, though, this film elevates itself on the strength of its ideas. At every turn, the script is layering subplot upon subplot, and yet managing to convey them all cogently and amidst well-paced action set-pieces. There's so much going on in The Chronicles of Riddick that it's no wonder some reviewers have taken it to task for being overly-complex. Yet, that's the exact quality that sells it for me.If nothing else, outside of Saving Private Ryan, it's probably the best thing Vin Diesel has ever done...for whatever that's worth.",The Chronicles of Riddick

But so far his notebook - which fell into the hands of the producers of The Chronicles of Riddick - is full of derivative cliches that an adolescent might think are the makings of an epic... but lack any of the depth or characterisation needed to appeal to a thinking adult.The script is loaded with ""ideas"" as shallow as their names: the ""necromongers"" who worship this ""underverse"", lead by ""Lord Marshal"", and the only one who can stand up to them is the last surviving ""Furian"", who (for some reason) goes to the prison planet ""Crematoria"".  Not that there's anything wrong with cool-sounding names (""Darth Vader"", ""Shadowfax"", ""Excalibur"", and ""Argonauts"" are all evocative names), but they're not enough in themselves.

Vin Diesel was hot. I did find it weird seeing Vin Diesel with a beard and long hair. Some parts of the movie didn't make sense. But I still found it to be entertaining. I recommend this movie. I give The Chronicles of Riddick 7 out of a 10.",The Chronicles of Riddick
297,glenr-1,Not bad could be better,8,13 June 2004,"First a word on the comming attractions preceding the movie and why Riddick gets an A for effort. The attractions... Alien vs Predator, The Exorsist, King Arthur, etc. shows once again Hollywood's extreme lack of comming up with a new idea. While many of the themes in Riddick have been done before (reluctant hero for instance or conquering space bad guys (can you say Borg?)) at least the treatment is original.
Now about this flick  Once again the in the battle between plot/character devopement and action sequences in the given run time action wins. If the movie had been 20 minutes longer and that time given to better plot and character developement it would have been great. The action was relentless and very well done. The sets were great and the CGI well done. I don't expect Oscar winning acting from Vin so I wasn't disappointed. Deffinately a big screen flick so if you really are interested don't wait for the DVD.",The Chronicles of Riddick
298,cadaverous,Much better than the 2 latest Star Wars films.,8,12 September 2004,"I wasn't in any rush to see this one. I wasn't Pitch Blacks biggest fan. It didn't really work as a Sci-Fi or a Suspense/Thriller for me, and there was a bit too much Macho posturing from Vin for me to stomach. Not that I think he is a bad actor, he has more acting hits than misses.So I'm sitting there, and it starts up. ""You know this had a $100 million budget don't you?"" my friend whispers. ""ooohhhHHH"" There was me expecting Pitch Black + $15 million, I didn't realize they actually went to town with this one.And you can see where the money went. This truly is good attempt at a Sci-Fi Epic. From the trailer I expected the generic 'Copy/Paste CGI monster horde' to be attacking a Planet this time, instead of a small group of crash survivors. (Yawn!) That was my mistake, the trailer does not show you what this film is about. In fact we get a proper Alien invading foe, in the vein of The Borg, that make the Borg look like a rather Exoteric and welcoming place for your fragile human body to end up with! From the Dune-esque sets and costume design, to the surprisingly good acting, and interesting Sci-Fi situations which show no quarter to the lowest common audience members, this makes for a compelling and interesting Sci-Fi Epic. Don't get me wrong though, this isn't some 'Quirky' or 'Arty' Sci-Fi flop that will emerge as a Cult Classic some day. It's much more fun than that :PYou see one thing this film has, that for example, Dune lacks, is Pace. It moves at a relentless speed going from one situation and story arc to another, inter-cut with some big scale CGI shots. And overall it flows perfectly, right up to the finale, where it ends in a very satisfying way. A fairly simple story well told.Combat scenes are probably this films weakest link. They are cut MUCH too fast and stylised to the extent that you can't possibly follow the flow of the action. I wish more directors/editors would see Equilibrium and Fist of Legend, to see how bone-crunching kinetic action scenes should be put together. I am sick of this shaky-cam MTV fast cuts trend. However, action aside, this film has adventure, lots of different locations and scenarios, and again, solid acting and story. The acting particularly was strangely good at points.If you like Sci-Fi, I would say this is a safe bet, there is nothing too brainless in it, you won't find yourself ripping it to shreds at every moment, it holds up fairly well the whole way through. Don't get me wrong, it's nothing groundbreaking, but it's not the brainless turd that the critics have been making out, not by a long shot. This is a much better film than the current critical darling 'Hero' for me. But look at the 66% freshness gap on rottentomatoes. *sigh* Looks like the lack of acclaim for Riddick will continue to steer studios away from risky big budget Sci-Fi, but we can rest assured that we will get more Drippy Dull films about superhero warriors and their emotional problems.",The Chronicles of Riddick
299,lmiller66,Loved It,10,27 March 2011,"This is absolutely one of my all-time favorite movies. I could watch this over and over again, and still be blown away by Riddick's brilliance. I love his character which is a man who is heartless, cold, ripped, and fearless yet still has a soft spot for ""Jack"". I loved Pitch Black, which is a completely different type of movie yet still wonderful. Riddick is an incredible character, and I am really looking forward to more movies in the Chronicles.My favorite scene is when he kills a man with a teacup! I also like his little chase with Tooms the bounty hunter, and how he's not intimidated at all by him. Kira's got some pretty sweet moves, too. She's fast and can flip around and attack people like a little ninja. Her character is a real inspiration for me, until she dies.The other thing I really like is the symbolism about religion. I don't know if it's just my imagination, but to me it seems extremely obvious that the Converts stand for Christianity, punishing anyone who doesn't believe in the ""correct"" religion. Just my opinion. It could be any religion that represses others, really.",The Chronicles of Riddick
300,jshardy13-1,Good Movie,10,11 June 2004,"Beyond all of the predetermined opinions of the critics, and who actually listens to critics anyway?, this movie is good. It took a simple, short, and interesting movie (Pitch Black) and expands the lead character and gives him a persona. Pitch Black, I believe, was originally designed to be a solo film with no sequels or prequels. However, I liked the character of Richard Riddick and wanted to see him again. I have always liked the Han Solos, the Dirty Harry's, and the other anti-heroes in movies. No hero or heroine can be the white knight in shining armor. It's a myth and a fallacy.The special effects were spectacular and I find that I liked them better than those in other sci-fi movies. Too many times people will go into the movie theatre with a predetermined idea of what they want the movie to be, and how they want it to end, instead of leaving their opinions at the door and seeing what is presented before them. The only thing I am wondering is where Riddick will go from here. I liked Vin Diesel in Boiler Room, Saving Private Ryan, XXX, and Pitch Black. I like the attitudes he gives. He's able to show the realistic view of life and convey in his gutteral words. This movie will never make it to the Oscars, nor will it garner rave reviews by the critics; but as I said before the critics aren't really worth listening to in the first place. They walk into a theatre with an idea of what they will give the movie and whether they like the actors/actresses or not. Leave the opinions at the door, walk in and watch what is put in front of you.As for you who cannot do that and think that you can make a better movie, move to Hollywood, write a screenplay, and get it sold. Then you can make a movie that you want. If you don't have the drive and determination to do that, then sit back and let others do it. You will find more pleasure from movies if you suffer from temporary amnesia for a little while and pretend you'd never heard of anyone in the movie or anything said about the movie.The Chronicles of Riddick takes a stab at an interesting idea that has been ignored, letting the bad guys fight the bad guys. Give it a shot and open your mind when you go in and see it. Don't over-analyze it, don't go in thinking you're seeing the next Blade Runner or Star Wars, you're not, you're going in to see another movie about another character, in another time. Enjoy the movie...",The Chronicles of Riddick
301,himene,Surprisingly entertaining.,8,12 June 2004,"I just saw the movie today and was surprised.I am not particularly a fan of science fiction and I am even less of a fan of Vin Diesel. In fact, I only watched the movie because I lost a coin toss. I expected very, very little--but was very pleasantly surprised.I never saw Pitch Black, but I don't think that matters entirely as long as you know the basics. Just go and read up on the IMDb Pitch Black entry for that. But if you're too lazy, Riddick is a villainous escapee convict who wouldn't care about fighting evil if he didn't have some people he cares about at stake. Unfortunately, Riddick is apparently the only man who can stop the race of Necromongers from killing/assimilating off the Universe.The movie is full of mythology and interesting alien races, it's the sort of thing that made Star Wars great (minus annoying children and talking animal aliens.) It's a nice mix of fantasy and sci-fi, and it isn't gory--which is a plus or minus to some people. The action scenes are interestingly directed, they're cut super short and you never get a clear shot of many of the fights. I personally liked that, it was different. As for the acting, well, some actors did well and others didn't. Thankfully, Vin Diesel's character isn't a talky kind of guy and isn't waxing poetic throughout the movie, so he's effective in his role. Thandie Newton is great as one of those manipulative vixens in the background.In short, it is not a deep movie...but it's very entertaining.",The Chronicles of Riddick

There were no sound effects, or even sound for that matter in the US release, but with the directors cut there's more violence action and sound with it, I loved it.... Please make the Trilogy Vin Diesle Rocks. Also the prison scene should have been a bit darker. Another quarrel I had is that the writer never explained the reason for his eyes.

305,Cian-Faal,An underrated Sci Fi movie,8,28 December 2004,"This film has gotten terrible reviews, and I feel as if its bad press is undeserving. It's a good film, and it frustrates me that people hate this movie. So what if it doesn't have a good, original plot? What movie does have a good original plot? Look at Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. That movie didn't have an original plot, but yet people praised that movie to high heaven.Why do people insult the Chronicles of Riddick for its plot? Sure, it doesn't have the best plot in the world, but it's half decent. Besides, the Chronicles of Riddick is an action film. What kind of moron goes into an action movie, like the Chronicles of Riddick, expecting an Oscar winning performance? When I go into a movie, I don't care whether the plot is good! I watch a movie to be entertained! Why bother comparing the Chronicles of Riddick to the Manchurian Candidate (Or what have you)? Would you go into a movie for kids and say the movie is crap because the story is cliché? Of course not. So then, why are people dissing the Chronicles of Riddick for its story? Kids movies and action movies don't require plot for them to be entertaining. Drama films, mystery films and romance films all require plot, sure, but why expect an amazing drama out of a film when the trailers clearly show that the movie is going to be a sci fi film? That doesn't make any sense! This movie isn't the best of all time. Far from it. With that said, it is a good sci fi film, and one that is very enjoyable. Don't let the critics fool you.

The CGI is pretty cool and borrows from Dune.This movie could have been a breath of fresh air on the failing sci-fi genre, but turned into a silly, but fun kiddie action film.I doubt there will be a sequel, but if there is I hope Twohy really re-watches Pitch Black and give us a adult sci-fi movie.C+",The Chronicles of Riddick
310,mib456,A very good sequel to a very good Sci Fi Movie,7,13 June 2004,"This movie DOES live up to the hype and expectations of the original. This could very well be the next great Sci Fi movie series. After disappointments with Star Wars and The Matrix, the people who did Riddick, played to the strengths of the main character and along the way, laid the guidelines for a unique and growing mythology and vision. While Riddick does strike one as vaguely familar to the original Dune movie, it also moves at a pace that finally seems to marry that much desired link between a good SciFi movie and good video game. Personally, I don't see the need for these things, but I can that this movie gets it right. The movie does not look like a big cut scene (ala T3), but it helps to teach the viewer of the Riddick universe and how it all works in conjunction with what they, the producers, want you to know of the mythology. There are holes and a few flaws, but there has yet to be a flawless sequel to a SciFi winner, since Empire Strikes Back. When you watch the movie, you are drawn in, while all the while harkening back to Pitch Black. The ""Mercs"" are more cartoonish than I would have liked. Johns was a serious guy, who's character was developed and understood. Toombs is seemingly very 1 dimensional. Other than greed, you just have no sense of why the man is doing and going through, what he does. I do see why they didn't spend too much time on him, there were many ""main"" characters to try and develop as it is, maybe too many. But this movie is more of an epic than the original, so I can forgive that as minor. There was a touch of Conan the Barbarian in the final scene, but again, why NOT do an homage to Arnold? Without HIM, a lot of the ""Action heroes"" we have today would not be as good. It would be very nice to see Vin and The Rock team up to do a movie, maybe even something in this series? Just a hope to anyone in Hollyweird that may be reading.., (smile)",The Chronicles of Riddick
311,ph-16,the perfect film for a brain dead and violent person,1,31 August 2004,"Hollywood believes that violence is both attractive and what a significant proportion of people want to see at the cinema. They may well be correct in this assumption. However, a necessary caveat exists which is that violence does not necessarily make for good cinema. Violence is the progenitor of the Chronicles of Riddick. In fact, it is much more than just this, violence is the film's only motif, its only storyline and its only theme.The Chronicles of Riddick begins with a violent, ignorant and verbally challenged, ex-convict (or similar vagabond) being chased by equally eloquent mercenaries. Brute force, ignorance, belligerence and 'night seeing eyes' cause our hero to triumph over his pursuers although they follow him through the film. And that is it, that is the storyline which is both repeated in the individual scenes, over and over again, and is the central theme of the movie. All of the characters we meet are violent and fools, all are clones of each other.The next master stroke of the film's production is to take the non-existent characters, couched in nothing but violence, and to place these within scenes which happen for no reason and which frequently disobey the laws of both physics and common-sense. For instance, the seven hundred degree Celsius sunrise heats the rocky planet's surface as it passes over this. However, our heroes are able to flee from the effects of being roasted by simply hiding in shallow crevices which remain 25 degrees in spite of the minus 300 degree night time temperatures.Scenes happen for no reason. Violence happens for no apparent reason and with no impact on the story. Two 'rock cats', beasts of the extreme conditions, are let into the penal institution for no explained reason and then our hero, Riddick, tames them, for no reason. This occupies five minutes and then the film continues totally uninformed by what has happened.The special effects are of a similar style to the rest of the film: they happen for little reason, are spectacular and violent, but closer investigation of them reveals them to be ridiculous.Couple the above with Vin Diesel's inability to act and one dimensional performances from the supporting cast, and you have the ideal film for violently minded, brain-dead viewers: 'The Chronicles of Ridicule'.",The Chronicles of Riddick
312,tolliver11,For Lovers of Sci-Fi and Classics I recommend The Chronicles of Riddick,8,19 June 2004,"I loved Pitch Black. I thought it was a wonderful sci-fi horror movie that kept me on the edge of my seat. So when the sequel (The Chronicles of Riddick) came out I was determined to see it. I thoroughly enjoyed the Chronicles of Riddick. I loved the way the writers and producers blended sci-fi with classical literature. It was pretty interesting to see how the theme of Shakespeare's Macbeth was woven into the story with Karl Urban playing Vaako, equivalent to the Macbeth character, and his wife (Thandie Newton) playing the power hungry Lady Macbeth. I thought Judi Dench was also good in playing the sooth sayer witch, which reminded me of the three witches in the beginning of Macbeth. The quest of the necromongers was similar to a jihad (reminded me a little of Frank Herbert's Dune), with most of the followers willing to die for the leader (Colm Feore) without question on his maniacal quest to conquer the universe. In order to get to their Promised Land they either destroyed entire civilizations or converted them along the way. The politics of the necromongers' court was somewhat Machiavellian; in such that political intrigue was constantly present and an incentive concept for upward mobility existed which was simply put ""You Keep What You Kill.""In the original movie, Pitch Black, Vin Diesel played an uncompromising man of few words; a walking killing machine. He had no ties with humanity but his human side prevails in saving two of the crash victims and not just thinking of himself. In the sequel, he continues that role, but he again shows his humanity by saving/attempting to save those he appears to care for.Finally, the movie seemed to have milled a scene from the New Testament in which an entire generation of innocents (children) were killed to prevent a prophecy from occurring. As Herod the Great ordered the deaths of Jewish Children to prevent the taking of his throne by Christ so did the Lord Marshall (Colm Feore) attempt to destroy the entire race of Furions (Riddick's mysterious race) by killing all Furion infant males at birth. The special effects are great; the action scenes are great. The movie had a segmental ending which left the door open for at least another sequel. I recommend this movie to anyone who has an appreciation of science fiction, classical and historical literature.",The Chronicles of Riddick
313,egajd,"Director's Cut Far, Far Better than IMDb's 6.4 Rating",9,8 August 2010,"I have watched this movie several times through my idiot box, without having any awareness of how it did at the box office or of its reviews. (I don't remember even noticing it or anything about it when it was released.) Even before seeing the director's cut, I thought it very good.Tonight I watched what I didn't know existed - the director's cut. Even having seen just the box office release I would have rated TCOR about a 7 to 7.5, mostly because of the excellent special affects and the quality of the action sequences, but also because of the intensity of Diesel's portrayal of the anti-hero struggling with his feelings for Kyra.The director's cut completes the story's continuity, and removes what had until tonight puzzled me. And so the 7 easily becomes a 9 or even 9.5. The only thing that keeps me from giving it a ten is that the parameters set out for the atmosphere of Cremotoria are quite blatantly violated. A small quibble, I assure you, but just enough for me to keep it from a 10.It is a very dark, and funny, and sad, and very entertaining sci-fi action movie.

314,Guillaume_Fayot,"The ""new"" Hollywood Formula.",3,27 May 2005,"This is just another of the ""new class"" of formulaic movies coming out of ""Hollywood."" Take a weak plot and add large doses of special effects and pyrotechnics.I actually fell asleep during the last third of the movie. FELL ASLEEP? Yes, because this is just one more of an incredible number of films that have almost the exact same formula. It's unbelievably boring.The protagonist is some sort of superhuman who is completely underestimated and misunderstood. The character is capable of getting out of impossible situations with superhuman strength and agility. He prevails, not due to any intelligence, but primarily due to brute force.I was disappointed when the Necromongers turned out to be ""human"" right along with Riddick himself. When dealing with science fiction one expects aliens to be different somehow from humans. I was also dissatisfied that the ""Lord Marshall's"" powers are never explained. How did he get them? Is he human at all? If he's not human why does he look human? And why wasn't Riddick defeated by Lord Vaako after the ""Lord Marshall"" was put down? The only interesting character in the entire movie was the cat like scaled creature on the planet Crematoria. I did appreciate that Riddick could relate to it when everyone else in the movie was trying run away from it.If this movie were not so similar to all the other ""slash and burn"" films produced in recent years I'd have given it at least five stars instead of three. I was tempted to give it a one simply for being so unimaginative.If there is a sequel I hope there's more substance an less CGI.

The Chronicles of Riddick manages to completely lack the first and to somewhat ruin the latter.First I found the fantasy elements of the movie somewhat stupid. Where was all that in Pitch Black? I have nothing against fantasy films but to me it seems that the whole world of Riddick went through the looking glass sometime during those five years and it just doesn't make sense.Second problem was that I obviously wasn't part of the target audience - the movie felt very childish with all the WWE fight scenes, illogical series of events that doesn't deserve to be called a plot, lack of graphical violence while being an action movie etc. I really wasn't expecting Riddick to return as some kids' action hero.And then the story itself. One part David Eddings, one part Star Wars and one part pick-your-favorite-super-hero pretty much sums up this movie.

316,Paradoxchairmen,Good Movie. Weird Sequel,10,20 June 2004,"The Chronicles of Riddick is one those films that as a lifelong movie buff I very much enjoyed but at the same time can see why my kindred brethren hated it. Personally I consider Pitch Black to be one the best sci-fi pictures in recent memory and very much looked forward to viewing this film.Although I very much liked the film it did not paint the same world as seen in Pitch Black. One of the overwhelmingly great qualities of PB was the fact that although it was futuristic, although it did have fancy gadgets and magnificently fantastical creatures it was still very much human and personal. You related to and understood each of the characters, and more importantly they were all flawed. They all and their internal demons to fight as well as the external ones. Whereas TCoR is a broad sub-plot driven action extravaganza with sometimes unbelievable fantastical characters. The story is intriguing and the characters well drawn out but I honestly think had you changed Vin's name to James or Bob it could've been a completely different film. It seems a lot like the director had this completely separate idea for a sci-fi franchise and crammed every aspect of it into the vaguely familiar world of Pitch Black and renamed his main character Riddick to please the execs.

The special effects were amazing and the characters had more depth in The Chronicles of Riddick, while Pitch Black was a very compact story. I would actually consider Pitch Black more of horror story than a science fiction one, which is what The Chronicles is, in my opinion.Only a few characters carry-over from movie to movie so it is not hard to follow, and even if there were a lot of carry-over characters, you'll have your hands full making sure you don't miss plot or story-lines because you even discover new things about the carry-over characters so that they seem almost brand new. So if not seeing Pitch Black is the only thing stopping you from seeing The Chronicles of Riddick, don't let it hinder you any farther, as it is not needed to be seen to understand the plot.",The Chronicles of Riddick

320,paul__kenworthy,This movie is bad,3,3 September 2004,"This is a very bad movie from director David Twohy, who previously made the low-budget sci-fi Horror Pitch Black, which made Vin Diesel a star.The story for The Chronicles of Riddick is so bad that you wonder why they got such actors as Judi Dench to appear. An army called the Necromongers is going through the universe converting or killing everyone, no-one but Riddick seems to fight against this army, when they tell the people to join them they just agree straight away, without complaining.The leader of the Necromongers (played by Colm Feore) has been to the promised land called The Underverse, he has been given special powers which allows him to move fast, which is an excuse for not-too-special-effects. And also allows for a totally 'Riddick-ulous' fight between him and Riddick.Riddick has been a hunted man for 5 years and he has a bounty on his head, so when he gets captured he gets sent to a planet called Crematoria, which happens to be the place where a girl he likes is, this storyline has absolutely nothing to do with the Necromongers, its just an excuse for Vin Diesel to be covered in sweat and run away from a really badly designed wall of fire.Some of the special effects are quite good, and they are the only reason why anyone would enjoy this film, the big statue that has four sides and four faces is quite impressive but there isn't much else that is good.Judi Dench and Thandie Newton are completely wasted in very small roles, Aereon (played by Dench) seems to have some super powers but we then find out that she is a prisoner, and the development of the characters is none existent.The fight scenes in this are just wrestling matches fought on big sets, that are only there because of the big budget, Riddick is supposed to be an unstoppable fighting machine, but he looks like he's just watched wrestling on TV and he thinks that it might help him win fights.Overall, it is a bad movie with OK effects, terrible acting from Vin Diesel, the characters are pathetic and the script is even worse. 3/10",The Chronicles of Riddick
321,kai-62,Even low expectations don't help,4,14 July 2008,"Before I start: I'd given this movie a 3 instead of a 4 if it wasn't for the scene with the can opener. And a 5 if the title role had been played by an actor.It is amazing in how many ways this movie manages to fail. First and foremost there's Vin Diesel, who visited the Silvester Stallone School for Advanced Expression and Acting - and failed to graduate. Then there is a confused (but really very simple) story, badly told. A science fiction world that completely ignores the rules of physics and reason and completely fails to feel futuristic at all. A ton of stereotypes mixed together. Dialogues that are meant to be funny, but fail to be 90% of the time. Fight scenes that have a lot of action, but are actually boring since all the bad guys act unbelievably incompetent.Not all is bad. Some of the actors (like Alexa Davalos) are quite good (not only if you compare them to Diesel), but the roles they play are somewhere between substandard and terrible. The effects are quite good, but nothing to write home about.I have avoided this film for years and finally felt compelled to see, if I had missed something. Expectations couldn't have been lower. They have been met.",The Chronicles of Riddick
322,cjhaacke,could have been better...cool but could have been better.,7,24 November 2005,"I liked this movie for the action, the special effects, and for Riddick; it was good, not great. It wasn't great because it tried for ""high sci-fi"" when it didn't need to; the Necromongers were excessive. The gritty, hard-edged, more realistic style of the prison, the mercs, it worked, but clashed with the overly stylized, almost ""high fantasy"" Necros. Like two different movies, grafted together and not that well. Riddick worked well in the one world, but seemed out of place in the second; similarly, he worked well as the murderer, the criminal, the survivor; as a mystical Messiah and fated warrior...not so much.The movie should have stuck with the dark, gritty world and left the pretensions of high science fiction to Buck Rodgers., not Richard B. Riddick. Nonetheless, I liked the character of Riddick that I followed it where the story took him; Riddick is just cool, and whatever he did, I accepted because he was Riddick, too damn intense to kill and more lethal than should be possible. Vin Diesel does him well, and shouldn't have tied to elevate Riddick to the mythic hero type. Riddick is no Luke Skywalker; might have stuck a shiv in the pretty boy, then looked at the lightsabre and said ""nice toy."", but not become him.",The Chronicles of Riddick
323,s-gordon2,decent sci fi largely underrated,9,11 October 2006,"It seems to me that many of the people on here who have been particularly scathing about this film have one thing in common; they are not sci fi fans in the first place, so what are they doing even watching this film never mind reviewing it. The fact is that the TCOR is a good film, but not a great one. It certainly deserves a higher average than the 6.1 it gets here. It could have been great if more emotional depth had been given to the central protagonists to justify their actions. Having said that Vin Diesel is superb as Riddick, the guy has genuine screen presence and charisma. I'm giving it 9 out of 10 when it's probably a 7-8 to offset some of the other completely misleading reviews on here. The action is good and the special effects are rock solid. Recommended for sci fi fans.",The Chronicles of Riddick
324,desperate_stranger,How can you say it is underrated?,7,12 February 2007,"First, the combat choreography is not anything special - the massive battle is weak, the battles of Diesel vs some bonus troops is also nothing special (you can check out Banleau 13 for example to see what a battle should look like; or compare it to matrix... Riddick isn't anything special)Story - almost none, but this is not a weak point, we don't expect one here BUT, how can they copy the evil guys so much from the Starwars Sith. They have almost the same code, ideas, hierarchy !Yep, if you are amazed how Vin Diesel speaks his heavy lines with his bass voice and this is what satisfies you in a movie, you can give this one 9 or 10. Otherwise I see nothing so great and find vote higher than 6-7 very overrating",The Chronicles of Riddick
325,excruciation,Powefully underrated; A breathtakingly deep action flick.,10,26 August 2006,"If a film contained astounding visuals, well choreographed fight scenes and an infatuating storyline, would you say that 6.2/10 does it justice? The Chronicles of Riddick, an achievement in entertainment.The creators of this film (and it's prequel, Pitch Black) obviously knew what excites the viewer. Everything from the intense fight sequences to the Leviathan structures on Helion Prime (the planet on which a lot of this film takes place) draws the viewer interest and makes them curious about this expansive universe.Let's go into a little more detail...Richard B. Riddick is the main character of this film. Brought to life by Vin Diesel, Riddick has become one of the coolest antiheroes in cinema history.The film is about his journey across the universe to save the one person he truly cares for. Alexa Davalos does an admirable job as the feisty, blood-thirsty role of Kyra.The action in this film is derived from Riddick's battle with the dark army he comes across on his travels across the universe, The Necromongers. This is an armada fighting for a religious cause, and we all know the coolest armies are the crazed religious ones (e.g. The Covenant from Halo). The Necromongers are a fascinating race and give way for amazing visuals like immense spaceships crashing into the ground or Titanic structures erected thousands of feet high. Everything from their ranking system to their transport has clearly been deeply developed by the producers of Chronicles of Riddick.The settings of this movie are impressively realistic. You can feel the heat of the 700°C Crematorium and can sense the dramatic atmosphere of Helion Prime. The Chronicles of Riddick certainly provides a believable universe for the story to take place in.As for the storyline, I'd rather not say much about that but I will say that it results in a dramatic unfolding of events which repeat in your mind for long after you see the film.Flaws? Not too many but this film has been criticised for lack of wit and intelligence but the critics need to imagine the film with 15 minutes of dialogue instead of every action sequence and evaluate it then. Not very good is it? Looking through Rotten Tomatoes (http://uk.rottentomatoes.com/m/chronicles_of_riddick/) I also see a lot of reviews saying you need to see the DVD extras to understand but I feel this film stands well on it's own. I had never heard of the franchise until I saw this on SkyMovies and I found it to be adequate as a stand-alone film. Also, a lot of critics are using the Riddick-Ridiculous joke which isn't even funny. Ignore them.You'll enjoy this film for what it is. An action flick which has avoided being labelled as a 'Mindless' Action flick with an in-depth storyline, infatuating universe and a kick-ass lead character, Richard B. Riddick.See this one.",The Chronicles of Riddick
326,Sockre,Amazing,10,23 May 2006,"This movie is freaking amazing, its my favorite movie of all time. The badassity of every single character is intense, its the most hardcore movie ever. And unlike most sci-fi movies, its well done and its story actually makes sense. The graphics are some of the best I've ever seen, and the acting isn't even bad, but you don't watch this kind of movie for acting, you watch it for the action, which it delivers in full force. Riddik kills a man with a tea cup... can't get much more badass than that. The storyline is even complex and interesting, there are some parts that aren't explained, but they probably will be in the future chronicles. I really hope they are able to make more. Overall its a fantastic movie.",The Chronicles of Riddick
327,isecore,Very Basic Action-Scifi Nonsense,4,1 November 2004,"This isn't complete drivel, but not far off. It starts off very intriguing with a nice evil villain, but after that everything disappears into Production Design-hell.Production Design is spectacular, but everything else is spectacular only in how amazingly lame it is. There's no character development to speak of, and action-sequences are set up only as an excuse to have an actionsequence; they add nothing to the plot and the movie actually has too many pointless action-sequences.The enigma that was so nice in the beginning quickly disappears and is replaced by pointless oneliners and silly actors who seem to have a hard time keeping a straight face while saying them.If I was 12 years old I would think this is a kick-ass movie. Seeing as I'm a lot older than that I think it's crap because there is no mental challenge here.",The Chronicles of Riddick
328,goc-5,Beautiful crap,1,1 January 2007,"The visuals are great. Over all it's a very beautiful movie, so it's great if you want to show of your new TV or projector.But the purpose of a movie should be to deliver a story. And if there were a story, I sure didn't see it. You're contantly tossed around by the extremely fast clipping of the scenes, and is shown all kinds of things without ever getting an explanation for what it is, or why things are the way they are. You just sit there and watch badly cut scene after scene without understanding anything of what it is, and why they are doing what they're doing.Pitch Black is one of my all time favorite movies, but this wasn't at all like Pitch Black, and I would hardly even call this a sequel.",The Chronicles of Riddick
329,hejbreovojemojmail,"The chronicles of the Riddick, the wacky religious zealots, and some cgi",3,28 January 2008,"Well, that sucked. Bad cast, bad story, to much money involved, no fun seen on their faces, everybody was so busy trying not to screw up, too look sharp that it shaped the movie into something too serious. Where was that candy from Pitch Black where Riddick takes his time to take a sip of whiskey on a chair, under everyone's noses, where was that moral, human, ambiguity seen in Fry and in Riddick from PB... Thandie Newton was wrong to use, Karl Urban was underused and directed poorly, Vin Diesel has more to him than his physique, but they opt to use his brawn more than his other talents, Kyra... that was stupid. Just listen to Vin's intro for Pitch Black, hear the emotion in his voice, feel the hurt? He can do a lot more than take off his goggles every 2 minutes to show his bad boy eyes. The movie itself is made by the book, took no chances and it shows, in a bad way. Everybody seems to want to make another LOTR movie, bet'ya they used LOTR armors as well. LOTR sucked, read the book you lazy kid, Chronicles of Riddick sucked accordingly. Riddick lost his appeal, became a mixture of Han Solo, Indiana Jones, Neo and every reluctant bad mother# with a heart of gold we have seen in a movie so far. He also seems to have a thing for kids, get's you wondering what got him in the slammer in the first place. Where is that human Riddick, a survivor taught by life's harder edges, all i saw here was Han Richard Rambo Anderson. God damn. Put in some 'Dungeon siege' and KOTOR's dark lord Revan Nihilus, who has been at the end of the Underverse and seen it all, and brought a forge with him, to kill planets, wait, i get confused... Terry Prachet should trademark 'Verse, so no one can pull 'verse again. And what's up with those corpse-phones, don't they have, you know, technology? It's a SF remember? Repeat after me, 'There are no elves in space'. It's a shame, i know this movie made a lot of fan-boys do some hypnosis on themselves, trying to tell themselves it didn't suck as bad. You have Riddick, swinging from ropes, saving the damsel, you have (spike)likeable repeating villains, planned to use in the sequels (Spike from Buffy), you know, the sort that goes good at the end of it all and saves Buffy, that sort of guys, you have ugh 'Destiny' and 'Proficies' and 'Fate' and 'Power-up flashbacks'. You also have here the girl dying, which gives our hero 00xxx Stallone Wallace some extra angst to use against the guy who strangled his entire race with their umbilical cords.. he's so evil! But has nice armor, stolen from 'The gladiator' mixed with some Bioware's 'Jade empire', and is a midwife! oh, don't forget lady Judi Dench replaying her M role, but now she's called an 'Elemental'. Kill off the previous cast so you can have a fresh start, over-use 'the one' story heard gazillion times in the last decade, follow this plastic Hollywood blockbuster recipe , forget soul, wit, edginess, take no chances, buy that 3mil$ house right next to Tom 'Watched his own movies to many times' Cruize. Pitch Black treated death of a human being with respect, in COR, Riddick makes it a game, and shares it with a girl, who he feels brotherly of (no, nothing else is there, this is a safe movie, no way he could feel something else, remember we don't want to make you think). From a charismatic jack of all trades that speaks seldomly, which only adds to his mystique, who is human and believable, we get our Neo-Riddick that speaks way too much, meaningless stuff, explaining the plot events to the dumb audience, looking artificially cool all the time. And Kyra, what the hell.. and that prison... it was a joke. They feed the prisoners with stone-armored night shined leopards, the warden is a Russian (how fitting, after all, Russians are all corrupted and susceptible, and their technology is archaic and rusty, and tends to malfunction), the prison itself felt like one from those south-American soap operas, the prison was a cardboard drawing, add some black characters (+ Imam that got blaze of glory) for ethnic diversity, some girl power 'cause all girls are strong, most are armed and they all plot, but in the end they all feel the need to be so fragile and die in the hands of the main character. What did i forget... the movie was too long. The only cool thing in the movie was the teacup heart procedure, even though i've seen a similar scene in 'The last boy scout' with Bruce Willice. God damn, why did i expect something more. Money gets them all, always, money is what American cinema is all about, cash is king. All hail the necromongers. So, basically, you have here a 6-star low budget pearl called 'Pitch Black', that went into a 2 star over-funded flick with wrong role models, called blockbusters. Empty, that's how this movie leaves you. The story should have sticked to the basic premise, not bring Narnia into it. The chronicles of the Riddick, the wacky religious zealots, and some cgi.

330,pintsizeX,Chaos and disorder,5,20 June 2004,"The first half of this film was chaotic and disorganized and left me confused and unfilfilled. Nearly every fight scene included a strobe light effect that was redundant rather than artsy and seemed like a waste of film. Everyone who went with me agreed the second half semi-saved the film and held the audience's attention better but couldn't compensate for the fact that Vin Diesel's acting is terrible and his constant one-liners are predictable and annoying after ten seconds. Overall, I'd say to go with some friends, pretend you're playing mystery science theatre and bring lots of fun dip to amuse yourself...at least that's what I did.",The Chronicles of Riddick

Anything that helped in understanding these five essential elements of the Riddick Trilogy were greatly appreciated. The rest was just...entertaining. I watched and read The Chronicles of Riddick (III) before watching Pitch Black, although I had read the book Pitch Black. The Chronicles was a better film than Pitch Black, but I know Pitch Black helped make sense of some of The Chronicles. There were a number of ah-ha moments... Riddick's relationship with the Imam and ""Jack"", why he is on the run, ""Jack's"" statements that were repeats of what she learned and heard in Pitch Black, and more. Dark Fury is an animated short that really does a number of neat, but non-essential things: introduces Toombs the merc, demonstrates Riddick's fighting abilities, and explains the tightness of him, Imam, and Jack. The Chronicles of Riddick (III) was great. As I mentioned, the concept of and cinematography ""on"" Crematoria was worth the price of the movie. There's what is missing. We really need to know more about the pre-Pitch Black portion of Riddick's life. What was Furya really like... a futurist Sparta? And then, given that Riddick got to ""keep what he kills,"" what does he do with the Necros when he becomes Lord Marshall? What happens to their search for the Under-verse?

334,betut-1,I liked this movie and so did most of the rest of the audience!!,10,12 June 2004,"I just saw this film and I really enjoyed it. Sure, it is not the same a ""Pitch Black"" which I think was also a good film in its own right. ""Chronicles of Riddick"" is a big budget summer blockbuster film and on that level it succeeds. Sure it is silly in parts but we are not discussing a project based upon a Pulitzer Prize winning novel. It is action packed science fiction. I think Riddick DID stay true to the character he played in ""Pitch Black"". While the Riddick in that film was a brutal, self-centered opportunist, I think we see by the end of that film that he had good characteristics as well. The Riddick in this film is still brutal, self-centered and opportunistic (see the full size statue of Riddick shown during the end credits) but we see more of the decent aspects of his character as well. The action scenes in this film were great! I especially enjoyed the ""topside"" chase scene on Cremetoria. And Thandie Newton was a really good ""baddie""!The thing that pleased me the most was that there were people of color in central key roles who were not stereotypes. The main hero was not the buff blue-eyed white man out to save humanity that we have been feed by Hollywood. And the female characters seemed to have more sense at times than the male characters. Thandie Newton's character had a much better grasp of court politics than her husband and Dame Judith's character wasn't just the stereotypical ""wise mystical being"", she was politically savvy as well.The only problem I had with the film was the lack of development for Linus Roche's character. I just did not believe his actions toward the end of the film. But, that is trivial.All in all, it was a good way to spend about an hour forty five on a Saturday evening!",The Chronicles of Riddick
335,joshreluctant,One of the best Sci-Fi films in years.,7,16 June 2004,"I never saw Pitch Black, and upon viewing the trailer, a friend told me to see it based on David Twohy's amazing direction. Turns out, he's one of the few directors who can be given 120 Million to play with, and turn out a good film. We've all seen the loner hero character played out before, but what makes it unique every time is the badass qualities that they possess. Vin Diesel pulls it off perfectly, and after being somewhat sketchy on seeing the film based on his ability, I'm firmly rooted in the belief that he's a skilled actor. The entire movie played wonderously, and it didn't seem to last as long as it actually was, a point well earned and oft won in the sci-fi genre.The story begins with bounty hunters looking for Riddick on a desolate ice world. They spot him, and try to capture. Easily, the badass Riddick escapes and draws them into a trap. The next scene is the mercs (mercenaries) trying to hunt him through an ice cavern. This is where the film truly shines, because obviously you can't make a hovership and film it in an ice cave over 10 stories high, using high paid actors. The special effects are amazing, and barely noticeable in the film. You'd think they shot it all on location throughout a distant galaxy. But of course, they didn't, it's all from Twohy's amazing visionary skills. I was definitely impressed with the way he handled the special effects and action sequences. There are scenes where it could have been in The Matrix, and would've been ruined by the films crew. But Twohy pulls it off, and makes action packed slow motion fun again for everyone. The fight scene at the end is amazing, and once again, the effects are flawless.Truly a film to see. Not just for the characters or story, but for the popcorn chomping mayhem which will ensue during the unveiling of this amazing Sci-Fi epic.10 Stars",The Chronicles of Riddick
336,Twisk,Appalling movie!,1,23 March 2005,"There are magnificent visuals, true, apart from the ridiculous ""necromonger"" hats - some guy even wears what appears to be a black grid of sorts covering the top of his head. The plot seems to have been written by a twelve years old, but the worst of it remains the names. ""Necromongers"", for instance, a mixture of Greek and English only a retard could think of. And a planet is called ""Crematoria"". It is supposed to be a very hot planet, they even give its surface temperature, why give it a stupid name which insists on its heat? The dialogs couldn't be any flatter, and I marvel at the capacity of the actors to utter such nonsense without laughing - well, maybe they did...Nice visual effects are not enough to make a good film. And an action film doesn't have to be dumb (see Aliens , for instance, or Demolition Man).",The Chronicles of Riddick
337,delerme,Much better than the trailer,8,20 August 2004,"When I saw the trailer, I was really disappointed since it looked like a no-brain action movie, a sad successor to Pitch Black (I particularly enjoyed the first half of that movie, before we see the aliens and appreciated the character development). Actually, it IS an action movie, but it does all the little things right : the combat scenes (for once, the muscular hero does seem to be all walking menace - take note, Arnold, Steven,the rock), the one-liners (which I didn't see coming about half an hour before they're told), the characters (much less developed than in Pitch black, but well...), the ambiance (great visuals), the CGI (much better than ""spiderman 2""). What did make me cringe were the choices for names (""furians"" is the most striking example) which are, shall we say, not very subtle. Bottom line, it has little to do with Pitch Black but Twohy managed to pass the test so many failed : deliver a multimillion summer action film that does not insult my frontal lobes. I'm still waiting for another film in the vein of Pitch Black though, centered on characters rather than action (if you guys want to see that kind of film by that director, I suggest renting ""below"")",The Chronicles of Riddick

It was definitely better than ""Pitch Black"", even though that was a brilliant movie as well. The film, in my opinion, had some of the best fight scenes there are (especially in the Directors Cut DVD.), The story line was good, which I liked a lot because there're stepping over to the sci-fi trilogy type movie like Star Wars, and the character Riddick just kicks A**. You gotta' love him! He can kill people and still get away w/ it and he saves the universe! What more can you ask for a hero??? This is my favorite film..... and it should be your's.

339,kamyk2000,Why compare when you can enjoy?,8,7 December 2004,"I thought this movie was riveting. It did start a little slow, but soon thereafter caught my full attention. I had to change mental gears from expecting a Pitch Black sequel/clone, but not in a bad way at all. And there ARE tie-ins with Pitch Black plainly evident unless you aren't particularly observant or haven't seen Pitch Black. I thought the special effects were some of the best I have seen in a very long time, and after I began to become adjusted to the more involved background story, I found it engrossing. I felt that the characters had some depth to them. Enough for me to care a little about a few of them anyway, and Riddick became a little less of a cardboard cut-out, and a little more intricate in this movie. Some of the action sequences are also pretty impressive. I find it quite disappointing that this did not do better in theaters, and intend my rental to become a purchase. I hope that they continue the series with the next one? or two? movies that have been rumored to be following. Those who found the movie itself disappointing, I would guess would be: 1) Hardcore sci-fi, or action movie fans who spent way too much time making mental comparisons to their favorite storyline/universe, or acting star during a movie to actually just enjoy the movie. 2) People who just wanted straight up action without all of the intricate details of a sci-fi storyline. 3) People expecting a sequel to Pitch black that didn't grow or expand on the storyline or character, who couldn't switch gears.I took this film as THIS film, and thoroughly enjoyed it. I did not spend the entire movie making mental comparisons to other sci-fi or action movies or stars. Yes some of it's ideas have been used before. So what? Plumbing was an idea used by the ancient Greek and roman civilizations. Should we not use plumbing, because someone else used it before? If you spend all of the time during the movie making comparisons, then you might not give the movie the full attention it deserves.For any who enjoy a good sci-fi action movie with a little thought behind it, and don't have some holy grail to compare it with, I would highly recommend this one.",The Chronicles of Riddick

But a few months later, I watched Pitch Black for the first time, decided I loved it, and wanted to try COR again. So I watched it alone this time and with an open mind. I found the second time to be much more enjoyable than the first. Although there aren't a lot of tie-ins to the first movie, there are many subtleties that only make sense if you'd see Pitch Black.

He is cool enough to be funny and funny enough to be dramatic, the movie encompasses a wide range of ideas but the most fascinating is the imagery of landing on Crematoria with six bounty hunters holding 'Vin' at gun point. I honestly fell for this movie, i think it had more to do with the action sequences then the special effects. I have to easily say for the critics that don't like comics don't expect anything more then a high tech version of toxic avenger. For all those that do like comics however and get into that Sci Fi stuff, This movie touches a little upon the original - 'Pitch Black' (not for long, lucky for us) and moves on to those incredible all seeing eyes of Riddick.

The most disappointing part was the credits, because they appeared too soon.Why are so many people critical of sci-fi movies? With so many biting comments against this movie, it makes me wonder what their motive is. Go see this movie expecting to see a fun sci-fi movie, and not star-wars reborn, and you will be plenty satisfied.I agree the acting is not up for any rewards, but there was nothing was left to be desired.

346,alan98,Not even reaching the ankles of Pitch Black (6 of 10) (small spoilers),6,12 September 2004,"Well the makers again did the easy and mindless job. After innovative and fresh Pitch Black (remember the colors? sounds?) we got a standardized action movie. We see some army - we hear drums, choirs we hear when camera flies around showing ""glorious"" attack ships.. this is so boring! Instead of creating some particular mood, they irritate me. There are much more schemes inside. These are details showing how little brain they put into making this movie. Small spoilers ahead!The plot is also wrong and ""trendy"". In the first part Riddick was just a criminal with a twist, who wanted to survive. Now, they made him A Chosen One, a savior, a messiah. A kid he rescued in the first part - of course - now is a warrior chick. Also they gave us this Necro-race, their ""legend"" and religion, the under-verse, involved planets, races. This is too epic. Too much star-wars-like. Spec. effects? I'd say - acceptable. I prefer a smart camera trick (color, angle, zoom, perspective etc) over tons of CGI. And we see tons of CGI here. that don't impress much there days, in times of Matrix and such.As for acting - you got to see Linus Roache - he totally reminds me of Rutger Hauer in Blade Runner. I'd say he's a copy! A good one:) Diesel is charismatic - no change here. A girl (Rhiana Griffith. Well, filmmakers probably thought that she's too innocent to be a warrior chick here) from Pitch Black was replaced with more hot Alexa Davalos - bad idea. As for the rest - well, you've seen these mercenaries, The Lord, The Betraying Wife.. nothing worth notice.Conclusion : don't waste money on the cinema unless you don't expect much. Better wait and rent it.",The Chronicles of Riddick
347,supersixman,Your basic mindless sci-fi entertainment,6,20 June 2004,"If you're not expecting much in the way of an intelligent or original plot, this is a rather entertaining movie. This movie delivers no shortage of spectacular fight scenes and other sci-fi action to stay entertaining, with enough dialog scenes to explain why Vin Diesel is supposed to be fighting and not much else.The villains he is set against are the Necromongers. With a name that seems like a bastardized mix of Greek and English and some vague goal they call ""The Underverse,"" they may have benefited from spending some time developing their background. The hints about their background often make no sense - I have to wonder, for example, why they call non-Necromongers ""Breeders"" while they seem to have relatively conventional attitudes about marriage. In practice, though, they exist to wear cool costumes, set out to conquer the universe, and get repeatedly stabbed by Vin Diesel's knives.They did, fortunately, spend a lot more time working on the Necromongers' appearance than their background. They wear imposing, sinister outfits that look like some cross between Roman soldiers and art deco. This Roman / art deco theme is carried over in their ships and buildings, too. This may sound like a strange combination, but seems to work pretty well together and make them look truly menacing. The Roman look does seem to be a bit of a cliché, but the Necromongers have put enough twists on it to make it look original. However, I do remember thinking early on that it was clear their Lord Marshall had failed to read the Evil Overlord Rules about how to avoid the mistakes that have caused the downfall of so many would-be conquerers. Not only did he copy the Roman look, but his soldiers are issued masks that completely cover their faces.My suspicion that he had forgotten the Evil Overlord Rules was confirmed as he made several other mistakes throughout the movie that countless other people who wish to conquer the world, galaxy, or universe had already made. I won't give anything away, but if you've ever read the ""If I become an evil overlord"" list on the Internet, you'll see quite a few of his mistakes. He also is not given much time to show everyone how villainous he is, other than directing forces to conquer or destroy planets.OK, so it's not a very original plot. The plot is basically an excuse to string together a bunch of fight scenes anyway. ""Riddick"" definitely delivers here, except for a few scenes where they started throwing in special effects at a breakneck pace combined with switching camera angles so fast it is next to impossible to tell what is happening. The fight scenes won't dazzle you with spectacular martial arts moves, but what the fights lack in finesse, they make up for in brutality.All in all, this makes for an entertaining action flick for times when you want to give your brain a few hours off.",The Chronicles of Riddick
348,RobertPaulson,Better than expected!,6,11 June 2004,"I went into this film expecting a disaster, as most critics would lead you to believe, however I was rather pleased with what I saw.Riddick is a two hour sci-fi action movie, that doesn't try to be anything else. The effects were great, the Necromonger arrival was the stand out special effects moment for me. Fans of Pitch Black will enjoy this movie a lot, it was cool to see Riddick in his prison environment and see all the things that were only talked about in Pitch Black. I don't really see why all the reviews are so bad, things like the music or dialogue are not really all that bad, I think to many people are going in expecting Hamlet and getting Flash Gordon, which is what this movie is supposed to be like anyway. My only negative is that Dame Judy Dench seems wasted in this movie, and her screen time is mostly unimportant dialogue. And I feel like the movie was a little choppy, maybe to cut the film to PG-13, but I expect a director's cut DVD to hit the shelves around Christmas, and I'll definitely pick it up.Over all, Riddick is a great summer action movie that delivers what you expect to see from a big budget summer blockbuster.

This movie wasn't dreadful, even though the plot was weak and lets be fair not very original, it did work as an action film with a few wonderful visual moments. However as in all Vin Diesel movies there are major problems with the dialogue, although the director has done well to make sure there is as little talking as possible without hindering the action sequences. The acting unfortunately is, to say the least wooden from Diesel although as he gets to flex his muscles in almost every scene the producers of this film obviously thought the viewers might not notice. Ultimately i think this movie works as an action adventure, yet the Si fi story line is weak and unoriginal.",The Chronicles of Riddick

I found it extremely hard to get into, and it also did not hold my attention. It's one of those things that you glance at and go, ""Oh please"". The acting is contemptible, in particular the almost unbearable and egotistical Vin Diesel. The characters themselves are awful. There are too many special effects and this can very easily ruin a movie, and this particular film is filled with them. I'd say this film is 90% lame and 10% pathetic.

Much is the case of The Chronicles of Riddick star Vin Diesel. Sadly for him and unfortunate for you, if this fits your view of him, but this film is grossly underrated. It is a truly well developed film. (As far as Sci-Fi's go) If you think back to some of the classic otherworldly Sci-Fi film's such as The Planet of the Apes, Aliens, Blade Runner, the Star Wars saga-all of these films take the audience to their world. A world full of their own genre, style, sociology not alike to our own, yet not too far off either. (Granted some better than others) The film is full of rich characters, planetary races, war-mongers, and ethereal beings. It is a tapestry of classic fantasy noir. And out of the films I mentioned above TCOR mimics the mythos that the Star Wars saga holds. It represents the 'coming of age' or growing into 'destiny' that truly great fantasy films capture. I personally believe people have become too serious with themselves to allow themselves to immerse in the different worlds a film like this introduces.Keep in mind that I do believe that the film should have ventured for the 'R' rating and had left some of the more ""intense"" battle sequences, as the MPAA put it, in and pushed the Riddick universe to the limits. Unfortunately a PG-13 rating somewhat ""hammed-up"" the credibility of TCOR, but I do hope that the Unrated version on the DVD measures up to this potentially fantastic universe paving the way for perhaps the future 2 chapters in the Riddick chronology.",The Chronicles of Riddick

Riddick,10,18 August 2004,"In 2001, the greatest movie maker alive Tsui Hark directed a sequel to "" ZU : Warriors of the Magic Mountain "" called "" The Legend of ZU "" ... Needless to say it was the most impressive movie of the year, i watched it twice in a raw, and then like 6 times in a week. The movie takes the ZU universe into a totally different direction. While the first one was a fast paced, hilarious, and artistically-not-to-much-money-involved crafted Wu Xia Pian, The sequel was a CGI lots-of-money, visually daring, dead serious movie. AND, it dealt with different layers in good and evil : the Good that id good, the Good that is wrong, the Good that is mistaken, the Evil that is worse etc...Today, David Twohy has done to Modern US-SiFi films what ZU2 was to Wu Xia Pian. Take it somewhere unpredicted, different looking ( eye boggling ), and dealing with "" different kinds of evil "" ...I don't know if David Twohy ever saw ZU2, but the looks and arrival of necro-fighters looks like Insomnia's warriors, the Quick zooming-outs from 100 meters in crematoria, the way the Lord Marshall moves... and all this without looking like a poor rip-off ( Matrix, anyone ? ) because David added his own bright ideas ( Matrix... hum ) in film making.I knew from starters that, with all the money involved he could never keep the same kind of F***ed-up bleached photography and defying editing ( Crash Landing ) there was in Pitch Black, but he managed to go a bit beyond that. And I thank him for that.Using extremely valuable SiFi plot lines ( coming from Dune, Foundations or EC Tubb "" Dumarest "" series ... and a  Conan twist ) and good character writing, David Twohy signed what is to me the movie of the year. maybe there are some ( very ) few things i'd disagree with ( the voice over is of no real use, the battle scene with only the music score could have gone better with battle sounds, the Final Shot should have been the great pull Back from Riddick siting with everyone looking at him... ) [END of SPOILERs] but I saw it twice yesterday, and it doesn't look like i'm a stop there...It is now 0 : 39, and i'm signing off.

This is a movie that you need to see more than once to be able to get it all. The humor is very amusing. The sets were well done very believable. Little to no blue screen noticeables.

Vin Diesel is the only actor who could fully convince audiences as the supremely cocky and supernaturally gifted killer Riddick.

I enjoyed it a good deal.Basically, ""Chronicles of Riddick"" occurs several years after ""Pitch Black"". Riddick is still roaming the universe freely, until he discovers that a bounty has been put back on his head and he sets out to find out who did it, and why.The style is entirely different from ""Pitch Black"", despite the fact that they are in the same series. ""Chronicles"" is more of a sci-fi adventure, although there is a certain block of the plot which returns to Riddick's original deadly planet/survival nature. This block is actually one of my favorite parts in the whole movie, which maybe shows what my preference is.The plot is interesting and original, containing many science fiction elements (lots of planets, space travel, weird aliens, evildoers bent on universe destruction...) but can also become easily confusing, so you must pay attention.The characters in this movie are divided into two categories: the cool and the weird. Some of the characters are awesome and you will love them...Riddick obviously included. There are others who will simply confuse you and make you wonder why they were even necessary in the first place, but as there will be two more sequels, I'm sure all that will be explained later.All in all, Chronicles of Riddick is an entertaining sci-fi movie...perhaps a little over the top sometimes, but hey, isn't that what sci-fi is all about?",The Chronicles of Riddick

358,againsthumor,parabolic (top up),4,27 October 2005,"First, the four out of ten that I do give are for effort. This is a nice production trying to do what it can within it's given budget. They made, what seems to me, a 'strategic' decision about spending more one SFX then on plot. This can pay off but they struck out on this one as far as I'm concerned.I really wanted to like this movie. But it was just a bore there isn't one funny situation in it (except perhaps the funny, albeit very predictable, coffee cup incident). The SFX are OK, but the design in my opinion isn't that great and takes away from the 'spectacle'. There isn't any credible serious/adrenaline moment in it either.Vin Diesel; I want to like this guy, but he doesn't convey this mystical legendary-ness that you would want from a movie like this.The story just moves too fast, and too much time is spend on the dull parts. If you are over 27, looking for a missed, cool, Sci-Fi flick, don't be fooled into thinking this is it. It's a waste of an evening. You'll have to watch something else afterward to forget the blandness.This whole notion of a massive evil empire isn't conveyed well at all.

359,ben-414,These other reviews are evidence as to why Hollywood produces limp plots,9,13 June 2004,"There's good evidence that most of the negative reviews of Chronicles of Riddick are the result of people not being able to pay attention to detail, have no grasp on what a plot is, and deny the importance of good storytelling.This film is not Pitch Black. I've seen them both. I've liked them both. But they are not the same - they both sit distinctly in their own genres.While CoR has its flaws as a film, it is by far one of the best instances of good storytelling I can think of in recent film history. The cardinal rule of good storytelling is to tell just enough of the story to string the audience along - to keep it interesting. CoR does that - well. Every element of the film is opened in a void of information, and then slowly introduced, providing more information about who characters are, what their roles are in relation to other people, and why it all matters. Good films do this: Luke is Vader's son, Neo is The One, and doctors Schneider and Brody are really Nazis. In this case, everyone is out to kill Riddick because Lord Marshal has a price on his head. There were multiple layers of social interaction between the characters, with each character having his or her own unique motivators.The other item that people seem to be getting confused by is the genre of this film. It seems a couple people were expecting it to be some sort of scientific study, devoid of any interesting dialog. Others expected it to be Pitch Black, which - to be fair - has a campy following. If I were to have to classify this film, I would say that it falls somewhere in the ballpark of a combination of Asomov's universe, Alien, Terminator, and the Star Trek ""Borg"". This film has the 'true' sci-fi undertones of a firm message about societal ills, fantastical technological creations and overall vision, as well as a large helping of action.For those that say this film was unrealistic or unbelievable - get over it. It's a fantastical story, for crying out loud! No, it's not terribly realistic to outrun the sunrise - but it's a lot more credible sounding than the concept of light sabers (at least at this point in time).There seems to be quite a few Diesel-haters as well. I can't argue the fact that he's gotten the reputation of being swooned after by females. He is not, however, a bad actor. He is a type actor - like Arnold, Stalone, Keanu Reeve, or Nic Cage - and arguably better than all of them, as the characters he plays have more depth and are more fun to watch than those of the previously mentioned actors.My criticisms for the film: the cinematography was pretty crappy, and the action scenes were not terribly clear. There was quite a bit of camera jerking and blurred motion, with the specifics of what was happening sometimes not clear - think ""Gladiator"" cinematography, only more so. I'd find someone else for the sequel's camera work. I would suggest viewing this film after watching Pitch Black, as the character development of Riddick is helpful for understanding the sequel.",The Chronicles of Riddick

Riddick is back on the big screen!Director Twohy wanted a surprising continuation without repetitions. Not the same planets, not the same creatures etc.. The Story of the new film has nothing to do with ""Pitch Black"" and they changed the genre from Horror/SciFi to SciFi/Fantasy. Thus there is not only completely new characters, but a whole universe all around Riddick, which has quite Potenzial.The Story is interesting, but unfortunately the 2 hours are too short to explain the Mythology and also show all the Action and Effects. (the Directors CUT DVD will be much longer) However the story has plot holes and the character development is not as god as in ""Pitch Black"".But the Visual Effects are great and the Sets are really amazing! There are also good camera drives, but on the other side the cuts in some action scenes are to fast and we don't see much of the Fight Choreography. Riddick is one of the few films, where also the bad ones are partly pleasant. That is not a miracle, because in the reason all important characters are bad in their way. But between this dark atmosphere there are a lot of cool Onliners of Riddick.Vin Diesel is again amazing as Riddick and the other actors also made a good job! Only the play of Thandie Newton is sometimes exaggerated, but on the other side she has a very beautiful costume. Judi Dench's role is small however fine and Colm Feore plays the Lord Marshal quite very well. Alexa Davalos mastered her first role as Kyra sovereign!

361,pete-742-519660,Entertaining Movie - Would Have Made a Fabulous TV Series,7,19 May 2010,"It took me a while to pluck up the courage to sit down and watch The Chronicles of Riddick. The idea of taking a small, low-budget monster flick and spinning a grand epic of a sequel from it seemed like a monumental recipe for disaster.But I'm glad I watched it. As others have pointed out, it's important to remember that this movie and Pitch Black are completely different entities, connected only through the central character and some of the support players.And given the freak occurrences that brought Pitch Black's narrative into play, it would be contrived and stupid for any 'Riddick' sequel to deliver more-of-the-same. So it more than makes sense that The Chronicles of Riddick should take a different tone altogether.The style and setting of this movie will be the biggest marmite element, with the big baddie Necromongers especially, looking like something from one of Star Trek's sillier episodes. Vin Diesel's dialogue is far too 'street' at times to be credible, but on the plus side, Judi Dench does an amazing job of making clumsy verbose dialogue seem natural and intelligent.My only real problem with the movie is that they tried to do too much in too little time. Had this story been given time to breathe and develop, it would have been a blistering series of cliffhangers. Imagine it fleshed out as the first 24-epiose season of a TV show... THAT would have been exciting.And the irony here is that the cutting-edge CGI effects used in this movie are now all pretty much doable on a TV show's budget. Like the Star Wars prequels, many of the effects look quite badly dated.In all, though, it's not a bad roller-coaster ride.Pitch Black was simple and scary.The Chronicles of Riddick is busy undemanding eye candy.They're nothing like each other.

The movie does represent a nice color palatte from hues of blue to bronze and shows off some mean pro-wrestling crossover type fight scenes including both a running backdrop and clothesline. But at the same time it is easy to get lost in this film from the confusing plot unfurling, unexploited ends, and characters being introduced then double-crossed later. I have to admit Colm Feore played a very cool part in the ending fight scene where he has the ability to transport, and does it repeatedly to punch Vin Diesel in the face.

Characters, locations and some good villains make this a fairly complex story. If you liked the Riddick character in TCOR: Pitch Black, then chances are you will like him in this installment. For me the stage to be entertained was set with the Necromongers arrival on the planets they seek to overtake. It was such a huge, dark and out of this world approach, that it really set the background and powerfully introduced the evil in this story.If you have never seen TCOR: PB or are not familiar with the story, you will undoubtedly be bit lost and confused. The movie is pure science FICTION, less science but big on the fiction part. It worked for me, as I was willing to let the movie entertain me. The movie knew what it wanted to be, and it pulled it off well.The story is pretty solid, although it relies on some familiarity with the main character and presumes viewers to be in the mood for a dark and at times campy movie. Acting is on par with this type of movie, dialog is at times flippant, but well timed and adds some dimension, costumes and props are well conceived and round out the movie well.

366,Crakin,"Stay with Pitch Black, save yourself 10 bucks",2,13 June 2004,"I had the unfortunate experience of paying money to go see Chronicles of Riddick. If there is one thing you can learn from reading these posts, it is don't waste your money on this movie. If the curiosity is killing you and you were interested in the character Riddick from Pitch Black, then I recommend you see this movie matinee or even better, sneak in after you see a much better movie. In hindsight, I would have rather watch myself burn a 10 dollar bill rather than go in and watch this movie.I'm actually quite surprised that this movie has received anything near the 6 mark on IMDb's ratings. After the conclusion of the movie, I was already making comparisons to Wild, Wild West in its unfortunate execution of an interesting idea. And after watching Riddick, I'm wondering which movie is worse. For those interested, it is as least as bad as Wild, Wild West and the Postman. And a pity too, for a movie where the uber-cool Riddick would be able to leave the dark planet from the first movie and be set free in a bigger budget flick seemed enticing.First of all, for those who do not heed my warning and actually want to see this movie, beware the spoilers ahead. The movie starts off with Lord Marshal (isn't that redundant) destroying another world. Then we are treated to Riddick fleeing from a group of bounty hunters on planet UV whatever. This brings me to another thing that bothered me about the movie, the unoriginal names for planets and races. A really hot hot planet is called what??? Creamatoria! Because it's hot! Get it! Riddick's race is furious. Guess what? That's right, he's a Furion. I'm surprised the opening planet wasn't called Radiationa or something. Geesh. But this is the one sequence that works for me. The menacing Riddick takes out the bounty hunters one by one proving that he is THE badass in the universe.He learns that a bounty was put on his head by his friend from the last movie Imam residing on Helion. (And yes, Helion does become hell on earth. Yes, it is going to get nuked by a hydrogen bomb. So Helion is another one of those clever planet names.) Now the big question in my head is: How can a holy man from Pitch Black who was flying Economy Class afford to put a 1.5 million credit bounty on Riddick? That is not explained, but it doesn't matter because we are treated to a fight with the locals in which Riddick takes off his goggles no less than four times. (Throughout the movie he removed his goggles no less 10 time! So much for subtlety). Because he can kick the local authorities butt so easy, it is time to enter the Necromongers. Yes the Necromongers, a dreary, drab excuse for a villain with the worst tailors in the galaxy. You see, the Necromongers lead by Lord Marshal, half human and (oooohh scary) half something else that is not explained, want to get to the Underverse. The UNDERVERSE!!!! What is this Buckaroo Bonzai across the Eight Dimension? At least Buckaroo Bonzai was campy and fun and did not take itself seriously. This movie has a pretentious air to it that takes itself too serious and seems to have little fun doing it. The costume and set design for the Necromongers make Stargate look subtle.So onto the next series of unlikely, impossible, and stupid action sequences. Riddick is captured by the Necromongers converting the planet in a town hall meeting. Insert action sequence. Necromongers welcome Riddick on the ship. More dreary, stupid effects. Then he escapes. Blah, blah, blah. Then, unexpectedly the bounty hunter, Toombs returns from the first sequence. You see he's followed Riddick back to Helion even though it's being invaded by a genocidal fanatic race. He really wants that 1.5 million. I guess the money is for his top-notch equipment. While not good to catch Riddick on Planet UV Already Don't Care, he is able to destroy a Necromonger Corvette with only a bazooka. Toombs with his shoulder mounted launcher is single handedly more effective than Helion's entire planetary defense force. In my opinion, if Helion can fall that easily, let them get destroyed for Underverse sake and move on to the next planet. Guess what? We do.Onto the really, really hot planet Creamatoria. Remember it's hot. Riddick is captured and he is being taken to the penal colony under the surface. He wants to go there because his friend is being held captive here. Good enough reason for several unnecessary and incoherent action sequences, including a chase by razor backed guard dogs. The dogs looked cool, but very CG. And worse, they had no purpose except for the sake of action and for Riddick to show his animal empathy. You see, 'It's an animal thing.' So more shoot-outs, more chases, then we get to the big grand daddy of them all: a run on the surface of Creamatoria to outrun the sun. Remember it's real hot. How hot? 750 degrees hot. Although there are many plot holes in the movie, I am capable of forgiving a couple or letting a few slide. This movie has many. But apparently the rocks on Creamatoria are cool enough to shield you from 750+ degree heat. Surprisingly cool. This hole is so big you can drive a Necromonger ship through it. Oh well, who cares at this point. Speaking of plot holes, I'm wondering while an ethereal air elemental played by Judi Dench, teleport in a wisp of air and glide around but become chained and imprisoned by the bad guys. Oh well.More action. Worse costumes. Onto the climax. At this point, it really doesn't matter. I had already stopped taking the movie serious 15 minutes in. And after Creamtoria, I was really starting to resent the movie for my wasted time and money. Back to Helion for the final showdown. The big action sequence is over the top. Everything is over the top: The special effects, the costumes, the over-acting, the supposed intrigue within the Necromonger ranks, the smarmy evil-ness of Lord Marshal, the conclusion to the fight, and the political ramifications. At this point, Lord Marshal is making Dracula from Van Helsing seem as menacing and well-acted as Hannibal Lector. I've stopped caring and now I hope you have.If there is one redeeming quality of Chronicles Of Riddick, it is Riddick himself, Van Diesel. He seems perfect for the role, the bald, brooding, gravely voiced Diesel is perfect for the anti-hero Riddick. In the more subdued Pitch Black this character was menacing and almost self contained. The danger of the light-phobic aliens was amplified by the danger from within. The fugitive Riddick was their key to survival, but we always had a thread of fear that he could and WOULD betray them at any moment. In this movie, Riddick is set loose. This is not a bad thing. While Diesel is on point with Riddick, it is the universe (or Underverse or whatever) that is off the mark. Given a better story, interesting characters, and a world (or worlds) we care about, Chronicles of Riddick could have been something special. When Riddick came to the Necromonger citadel ship, he says 'I would have gone another way.' Deisel was right. He almost says it with a wink under those goggles. I'm hoping that the Chronicles of Riddick stays only a CHRONICLE.2/10.",The Chronicles of Riddick

The movie would of been really good if the movie would of made sense though. I watched Pitch Black and I didn't understand a lot of the things that occurred. Hell, I don't think anyone in the theatre understood everything that was happening in the movie. At some points of the movie they refer back to parts that didn't even happen in the first movie, they made it as a conversation. They should of done flashbacks to help explain. Another problem I saw was that they barely introduced this Necro race and then they keep referring to it like we are supposed to know. I think Vin Diesel is always portrayed as that bad ass you don't want to mess with so I had no problem with the way they made him look.

Its completely different from the first one but in a good way. Pitch Black was sci-fi/horror not action. The action sequences in this are amazing as well as the fight sequences. Vin Diesel was born to play this character like Arnold to the Terminator. The special effects, fights and action make this movie a balls to the wall fun flick. If you have not seen it because of all the nay sayers, I say hogwash, wow never thought i would use hogwash in a sentence. I've seen this one three times now with different people and everyone who sees it ends up really liking it and asking themselves why they haven't seen it before this.

I came away after seeing this film thinking to myself....this was far better than any of the new Star Wars flicks. (You could call this the R-Rated Star Wars) The film takes place like 5 years after Pitch Black, and focuses on a race of people ""Necromongers"" who want to destroy every world. You have to pay attention and ""watch"" the movie to understand everything...if you can't understand movies like Vanilla Sky or Momento then you are probably going to miss a few things here. The Action sequences are awesome and the special effects are top notch. Compared to the recent releases out so far, COR is far better than anything out there. I have seen The Day After Tomorrow and even Troy and they are both good films...but what I take away from watching a character like Riddick is far more than any other film can offer. Troy had Achiles which is close but Riddick just OWNS all. He has a style to him that says ""F-You, I'm doing what I want"". Bottom Line: If you love action movies or bad A** characters then go see Riddick its the best thing out!.....I bet Riddick the character could even own LOTR.....",The Chronicles of Riddick

Diesel's character of Riddick is better presented in this film than in Pitch Black, and one could argue that Riddick works best when presented with huge odds against him. His motivations throughout the film are never about saving the human race, but stay personal, making him a classic anti-hero rather than a savior of humanity. The ""revelation"" he has the ability to bring down Lord Marshall isn't all that surprising, but what happens when he does will get your interest. Lots of action, plenty of chances to see Diesel act the badass. Go see it at least once.",The Chronicles of Riddick

As you know you build up expectations of a movies, sometimes you are disappointed sometimes you get what you hope for, this movie is of the later. Being a fan of Pitch Black I loved the character of Riddick, the anti-hero. This film is a perfect sequel to Pitch Black on a much broader scale. I hope that it makes enough money to warrant sequels because if it doesn't then it would be a great loss to a great character.

373,griesimatthew,Why are there no good endings.....?,8,10 November 2004,"Spoiler AlertThis Movie was OK. Riddick was really cool and of course kicked lots of @$$. However, the story line was a little hard to follow. The only relation to the first movie pitch black was Keith David or the character Abu 'Imam' al-Walid. Alexa Davalos replaced Rhiana Griffith who was Jack/Jackie and now called Kyra. And of course the only other (Besides Imam) character to remain true to character was Vin Diesel as Richard B. Riddick. The only thing true to the story line of the first film is a lot of main characters die. There were lots of gaps left between Pitch Black (2000) and Chronicles of Riddick, The (2004). Some say most of those gaps are filled by Chronicles of Riddick: Dark Fury, The (2004) (V). I would not know I have yet to see it. However, I do not know if it is just my luck or if it is the new style of movie but.. All of the main characters from Pitch Black should have all died and only Riddick get away. This is because in The Chronicles of Riddick whatever character does not die in the first version (Pitch Black) WILL DIE in the second (The Chronicles of Riddick). This includes Jack/Jackie/Kyra who for most of the movie (actually 99% of it) involves Riddick Trying to save.

I was extremely hesitant at first when I went to go see this movie due to the poor reviews I've been reading today but in all honesty its not as bad as a lot of people make it out to be. Special Effects are wonderful and it has an interesting story / plot twist. Tons of the outer space sequences looked absolutely phenomenal and it was a welcomed sight to see ""space battles"" again. A lot of the names of creatures and worlds were extremely lame (necromonger and crematoria) and seemed as if all effort in naming things was just put off.

It is fore said that only a man like riddick whose eyes glow can save the planet.This is an action packed adventurous movie with a great cast and a good mediocre film. If you look beyond the scenes in which you shake your head knowing these cannot take place and beyond the scenes where you can see some of them have been edited out, you can enjoy the special effects and actions scenes with Mr Diesel.

I went to this film expecting the worst, and what I got was a thrill ride with some memorable moments. There are times when the dialogue could have been less corny, but by the time the first 30 minutes are over, that is blown away. In a world now where too much time is either spent making a story ""politically correct"" (i.e. we will never see a Phoenix from outer space in the X-men films, it isn't real enough) or using too many special cgi effects, this film shines. While a lot of time was spent on the environmental cgi, it really pulls you in as being alien and new, an experience that had me gaping in awe through the entire film. This film is an actioneer, and doesn't try to be anything it's not. The fight sequences are elaborate and well choreographed, and the film keeps a breakneck pace for obvious reasons. It keeps you on the edge of your seat. If there are any Farscape fans out there, this is right up your alley in the way of pure fantasy, and this film is obviously a bow to the Conan films of old.

Unfortunately, it has a plot that is pure, hardcore science fiction, and that is truly alien to people raised on ""Alien"" and ""Star Wars."" The plot of this film -- the originality of concept, depth of development, and general ""that would be cool""-ness -- reminds me of books by Frederik Pohl. I'd be willing to wager that nearly everyone who says this film sucked would also say Fred Pohl's books sucked. But then, would they even have the attention span to read a book? My girlfriend lapsed into sleep during the film. What can I say? If everyone had my tastes, the world would be boring.This film is true science fiction, and it has lots of action and effects to give it plenty of kick. I loved it, but I am a true sci-fi fan.

380,Dupe_of_URL,good Sci-Fi/Fantasy flick,9,21 March 2005,"Saw the DVD a couple nights ago. It's a good flick. Sure, there's some holes I'd drive a truck thru {Riddick escapes the Grotto of the Quasi-Dead, then he's running down a street! The grotto is on-board the Basillica Ship - the Holiest place in the NecroMonger mythos. Did he just walk out? I don't think so. But, that's how movies get to be HOURS long.} Definitely a movie to kick back and enjoy the ride, if you start to think about it, it'll ruin the movie.Basically this movie is ""Conan"" remade into AD&D terms in a Sci-Fi setting. Conan's tribe/Riddick's planet is wiped out by bad-guy Thoth-Amon/Lord Marshal. Revenge in the end, guided by Crom/Seraa(sp?). Lotsa adventures and eXperience Points garnered along the way.Some of the ship design (especially the Basillica Ship) made me think of ""Dune"". Also the NON-Riddick combat. Doens't Helion Prime have some sorta defense force (other than a few fighters)? The NecroMongers have been ravaging for 30 years! Also the Necro death Squad scene (which also made me think of the Uruk-Hai blowing the wall @ Helm's Deep). Don't the Helios defense forces have any AUTOMATIC weapons? Makes the mobs running around be Bad Tactics. {See ""Dune"" and ""Starship Troopers"" for more bad mass combat scenes. At least in ""Dune"" they had the personal shields to explain the swords.} Also, don't think about the beginning (using and evil to fight another, Riddick vs Necros) and the end, Riddick is ruling the Necros {You keep what you kill.} If Riddick is truly evil, then the Necros under their 7th Lord Marshal will be even more pestilent.

381,pgoochuk,Gladiator meets Star Wars meets Dune in this fun romp through the underverse,8,12 June 2005,"Pitch Black had it's moments and an intriguing premise, so despite the sequel's negative press and poor box office performance, I decided to check out this Vin Diesel space opera, Chronicles of Riddick. The survivors of Pitch Black have returned to New Mecca and Riddick is still on the run, this time from mercenaries and the terrifying Necromongers (think the Borg crossed with the Roman Empire) who are laying waste to the universe. The premise is an interesting play on contemporary global religio-politics, as here the inhabitants of New Mecca are an inclusive, multi-faith population who co-exist peacefully, contrasting with the Necromongers 'if- you're-not-with-us-you're-against-us' neocon mantra of 'we will convert you, or we will kill you'.Essentially a film in three acts, following Riddick from initial merc capture and the destruction of New Mecca, escape from a triple-max prison planet (reprising and amplifying Pitch Black's meteorology) and final showdown against the Necromongers, the film charges along at a terrific pace. Despite the massive special effects, the film seems to work best on DVD, where one more readily accepts with humour the Dune-like pomposity and heavy dialogue. If you can overlook this, then you'll enjoy this immensely. My girlfriend, who normally hates these kinds of films, loved every minute. Hopefully will become a future cult favourite.",The Chronicles of Riddick
382,sonofnob,A matter of taste,8,9 April 2005,"Just had fun watching TCOR and am pretty happy about it. Good action, great visual stuff. A worthy successor to Pitch Black, though the two films are hardly related. Vin Diesel does a good and convincing job at playing an action antihero. As usual, Judy Dench adds to the film, even though her role is small here. The story is pure pulp SF and is short and predictable but is refreshingly dark and (mostly) unsentimental. It actually also has some interesting bits and nice side stories as a (smallish) bonus. Bits and pieces have been copied from Dune, without the film being a Dune copy. Compared to Dune, TCOR has more action and fewer Lynch oddities & boring bits. In my book, both films are good, about equally so.Reading some of the other reviews, it seems that people are fairly polarized in their opinions of this film. Like most pulp science fiction, it takes a different sort of suspension of belief from that which makes usual films work. However, the action makes it a fair bit easier, and I found it a lot more engrossing and convincing than any of the five (ridiculous but entertaining) Star Wars films, the uniformly unwatchable Star Trek stuff, or, for that matter, most blockbusting light entertainments. But that is just me. If you hate Dune, exaggerated action scenes, or (minor) plot inconsistencies, then you probably won't like this film.

I would love to interview Vin Diesel to ask what his excuse is for oozing bad acting all over this film, but i'm positive that I would find his performance as an interviewee unbelievable. The script made me weep for the trees that gave their lives to this project. A forest fire would've been a more honorable way to go. It was a mash up of incoherent rambling disguised as bad-ass one liners. They were bad, they were ass. They were definitely not bad-ass. The premise of the movie was not bad.

384,Ghostbusterx,Another epic popcorn movie,7,11 June 2005,"The Chronicles of Riddick is an epic sci-fi popcorn movie from Hollywood that has solid production values, a menacing score and the promise of being a major cinematic event. However, unlike the Matrix sequels which suffered from the somewhat confusing plots and subplots (honestly, did you really understand what it was all about?), Riddick plays it maybe a little too safe and gives us a very simple storyline to immerse ourselves within. This is where the popcorn element kicks in, and ultimately leads to a potentially disappointing experience.So, what can this film be compared to? Well, the first one that springs to mind is Dune. Riddick has a very similar production design, what with its ancient religions, obscure technology and architecture. But that's as far as it goes, because if you peel off the layers you will see that this is just another action film that deals with an escape, an invasion, another escape, and then the final showdown.If you are the kind of cinematic viewer who likes to reap the rewards from special effects and action sequences then you should enjoy this film, but don't expect any major plot twists or revelations.

It really stands above a lot of other movies I've seen and you can be sure of an evening of entertainment when you decide to watch it. The movie's atmosphere lies somewhere between Dune, Mad Max, the Batman movies and Alien III. Characters are well played and not always the regular types you see. The Necromonger characters and the Elemental played by Judy Dench are well worked out and original. Praise for David Twohy to keep the story in tune with the essential dark atmosphere of the movie. I didn't experience the storyline itself as very new, which for instance for me was the case with the first Matrix movie, but that's also because the theme covers several movies. But nevertheless, the storyline is well executed so I didn't care! At some point I got a flashback from Shakespeare's Macbeth.

Nice special effects, humorous dialogues, action... in a word - enjoyable. But is this really Sci-Fi? The unexplained ""half alive and half... something else"" attribute of Lord Marshal reduces a little bit the scientific aspect of the movie, but this can be forgiven.A week after watching ""The Chronicles of Riddick"" I also watched Solaris (2002). I am a big fan of science fiction and I also read Stanislav Lem's novel. After watching both movies I asked myself which of them is ""more Sci-Fi"" and which of them I liked more. I admit that from a point of view ""Solaris"" is a more ""scientific"" Sci-Fi (it even features a dialogue mentioning ""subatomic particles"") and also is psychologically more complex, but I really liked ""The Chronicles of Riddick"" more. Because watching this movie made me really feel like watching a Sci-Fi movie, while Solaris looked to me more like a psychological drama and almost not at all Sci-Fi.Some of you could think I'm too kind and nice in judging this movie. O.K, Vin Diesel is maybe not the most expressive actor but it is kind of ""cool"" and is suited for playing Riddick. And maybe Jack/Kyra character is superficially built.

It had a lot of cool twists but something about it always sat wrong with me. I kept that in mind going into Chronicles of Riddick and I have to admit that for the most part, I was pleasantly surprised. The film had good looks, decent direction and a good cast. However, some of the elements of Pitch Black that were in the first film got carried over, and most important of these are unexplained character motivations. The biggest hitch: Here we have Riddick, a convicted killer and supposedly a man of animistic instinct with no emotion, suddenly caring about these people he saved in the first film? Sure, I can buy that... if you explain why. And there lies the problem with both of these films. Nobody gives Riddick a chance to explain his reasons, but even as this film progresses, you start to get a feeling that they are trying in a vague sense and perhaps it has always been intentional to do so, in some attempt to make Riddick ""deep."" However, to Vin Diesel's credit, he relaxes into this role much more, making Riddick more understated and observant, and asides from the required mugging for the camera during big actions scenes, keeps his performance much more relaxed. Make no mistake: This film is about Riddick. While Pitch Black was about a crashed ship on an alien planet, with many survivors including Riddick, this movie is about him from the word go. So why not take that opportunity to flesh out Riddick some more? Towards the end, you can't help but start to make a few calls as to where the plot was going to lead and even by the end, they make a few predictable plays, but at the end, everything goes kind of silly, but the last end twist more than made up for some minor plot holes.***HERE BE SPOILERS***So the Grand Marshall kills Kera, even though she has already been converted. My friends questioned how she could be converted yet still be loyal to Riddick, but even more so... When Riddick says, ""You've killed everything I care about"" I was somewhat dumbstruck. Especially considering everything I've already stated, how could you have this impossible hard-ass all of the sudden look teary-eyed and start talking about caring? So he unleashes and between him and Karl Urban's role dispatch the lord Marshall. But the real twist afterwards more than made up for it. I can't think of a better twist on an ending since Planet of the Apes. And the look on Riddick's face when he realizes what he's gotten himself into is priceless. Not your standard ""see you in 18 months for episode 3"" sequel setup, but a genuine twist that makes you keenly interested in where they are going to take the next film, assuming one gets made. Stands well on its own and sets up opportunities for a great follow-up. Good sci-fi at the very least.",The Chronicles of Riddick

It has practically no story to speak of, forgettable and badly acted characters, one of the lousiest editing jobs I've ever seen, and about the only thing that kept me awake during this movie is decent artwork and nice special effects. I think the concept had potential but turning this into a vin diesel action-explosion-punching-fest was a very bad idea. About the only concept this movie tries to push forward, is being a vin-diesel-ism where he's the invincible guy who speaks in a loud, supposedly sexy voice (though he sounds more like he's got a sore throat) and is always confident and knows he'll eventually win the day. This takes all the surprise and suspense out of the film; we already know ""mr. confidence"" is going to prevail. Add to this a bunch of ridiculous, incongruent premises (hey, he can live in 700 degree heat just by pouring some water on his bald head) and it's absolutely obvious the producers' intent was to milk vin diesel's reputation before he gets old and turns into a raisin.",The Chronicles of Riddick
393,hhd,Enjoyable action scifi flick,7,11 June 2004,"Spoiler 7/10I enjoyed it but I thought Pitch Black was better. I liked:Vin Diesel as Riddick. Riddick is a smooth cat and there's nothing like a kick ass character that doesn't mess around.I loved the whole sequence on the planet with the prison (crimaterra or something like that?). The scenes in the prison were awesome and only topped by the subsequent dash to escape the sun. Ironic - in Pitch Black they were trying to escape the dark; here, they're desperately trying to escape the light. I loved the entire middle sequence of events on the prison planet the best without a doubt. The final battle against Lord Marshall was neat and I enjoyed it. I disliked:Why does Twohy feel compelled to kill off every ""major"" character Riddick comes to care for? I suppose he's trying to show Riddick's curse but I hated it. I could have done without the grand scale. I think Twohy would be better without the blatant attempt to imitate LOTR/Star Wars worlds. Evil necro army trying to convert everyone or enslave them? Bleh, I wasn't impressed.The action was good, but would have been much better if they didn't hold it back with that PG-13 rating.I cringed at the opening sequence with the starfighters (""Red 1, this is Blue 2, etc."") praying Jar Jar wouldn't be around the corner but thankfully, the movie didn't dwell on trying to copy LOTR's scale.",The Chronicles of Riddick
394,pablo_87ca,You need to read this....,10,15 April 2005,"First off, I'm going to say this: I loved this movie, but this movie was slugged by the press, and for whatever reason, people were listening to the critics, and not going to see it, or for that matter, giving this movie a fair chance at the box-office. I think people listen to the critics too much these days, and that's really sad, because so many good movies have never gotten their fair share of recognition over the years. Anyways, this movie had many things that Sci-Fi movies are lacking these days....originality. The Crematoria concept was brilliant, Helion-Prime, all that stuff was great. The back story was also very thorough and entertaining, so what's the problem? Also, I heard a lot of people were bitching about the ending....IT'S MEANT TO BE A TRILOGY PEOPLE!!!! Of course they won't spill everything right away, it's meant to be told over two more films. And the DVD tied up ant lose ends that we needed to know. I heard of the concept for the next two, and the possibility of a prequel, and it's sounds incredible. I hope they fund the next two, because this story needs to be told. It seems that ever since Vin Diesel became a Hollywood commodity, every critic and their best friend has been trying to down everything he does lately, I don't get it....he's got the talent, appreciate it. Anyways, I think this movie is a great beginning to an epic story, check it out for yourselves, don't listen to the critics....they didn't even like Star Wars, until it got so popular that they had no choice but to praise it. Anyways, like I said go see it for yourselves, make up your own mind, 8 or 9 times out of 10, you'll be surprised at what the outcome is when individuality reigns over listening to critic's vendettas on originality.",The Chronicles of Riddick
395,matt1958,Evil Star Wars,10,11 June 2004,"The setting: a nightmarish interstellar future. The plot: an evil dictator, using mysterious powers and world-destroying weaponry seeks to crush all resistance to his reign of destruction. Sound like Star Wars? Of course! Because, when you get down to it, it's a damn good story. So if you want to get a feel for this movie, take your mental image of Star Wars: the OLD Star Wars, in all it's camp and circumstance. Now change the characters into convicted murderers, the bad guys into religious zealout zombies, and the Death Star into a really interesting Baroque statue. THAT's what this movie feels like, and although many people seem to be disregarding it because of this, I personally think we should embrace it as a return to the kind of sci-fi epic that Star Wars once was. We suspended our disbelieve for A New Hope, and if you put yourself in the right mindset (childish? No, imaginative!) this film is not at all disappointingThe main leap of this film is at the very beginning, as you have to cram lots of ideas and awkward sci-fi names into your head all at once. The Necromongers, Elementals, and Furians - The Underverse, Helion, and Crematoria. If you can get past your initial overly-sophisticated rejection of these fantastical ideas, you are now in a world as deep as any since Dune. (With just as rich a backstory - go to the official website and delve into the reams of background data)Now enter the next big stumbling block for viewers: The Camp! Yes, I will freely shout that this movie is CAMP!!! So was Star Wars! This movie is a fairy tale about futuristic heroes doing amazing deeds. This isn't MEANT to be Twelve Angry Men; it's meant to be a story about epic struggles and massive battles, about the fate of humanity resting on a lone and reluctant hero! Of COURSE the dialogue sounds forced! Who cares? Most all of it works within the film, and that's what matters.It's somewhat saddening that people who look back so fondly on the space-operas of times gone by (Star Wars, Battlestar Galactica) now reject the same style of film outright when it's made by people of this era with modern special effects. We so easily overlook the poor delivery of Mark Hamill and Harrison Ford, but now Vin Diesel offers up an occasionally forced one-liner and people scream bloody murder!The Chronicles of Riddick is exactly what its director and star wanted it to be: Evil Star Wars - and that was good enough for me.",The Chronicles of Riddick
396,Eternity06,An underestimated Sci-Fi destined to be a cult-classic,9,29 October 2006,"I found the ""Chronicles of Riddick"" to be a movie that broke out of the ""sequels suck"" concern. It pieced every bit of the movie together without hesitation so that people weren't lost if they rented it first. (I know, I did.) I don't understand the reasoning for the bad reviews and low ratings. It's an action filled movie with a great action actor leading the cast along with the powerful people in the movie showing emotion. Overall, I found it to be a very universal kind of movie setting up its own universe and making it believable. When a movie can create its entire mythology and not get slammed for having hundreds of years missing out of it, it's a good movie.My only bash and the only reason it didn't get a 10/10 from me is some computer glitches. Example: The green screen showing on Riddick's goggles on Crematoria. Things of that sort. Nothing too killer, just little pet-peeves to a film editing major, lol.",The Chronicles of Riddick

He is a loner by choice. Why would he want to save mankind when he wants nothing to do with it? He's a member of a race of people called Furions. A great, strong , and fearless race who bow to no-one. Do all Furions look like him or is he the steroid version.

399,Mstrom42,"Wooden, disjointed, poorly constructed",2,20 July 2004,"Chronicles of Riddick, which I just got back from seeing was perhaps one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and this is coming from someone who loves Science Fiction a great deal. This movie was horrible, it made no sense, and then when things started to make a little sense it didn't make the plot any better. Vin Disel can act... as himself, which means the way he always acts-- as the near silent tough guy. I found him much more believable in the Fast and the Furious, and much more laughable in this movie.There were more cheesy lines in this movie than an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie and Matrix: Revolutions put together. It made me realize why, exactly, we accompany other people to the movies for... to groan together when a movie becomes too unbearable to stand. The characters, all of them, were wooden and cardboard and talked in stilted monosyllable sentences. It was like watching a cruel parody of a great epic like ""Lord of the Rings"" gone horribly wrong. The special effects and camera work of the movie does little to save it, but it was at least something to focus on when I couldn't stand the acting (or lack of acting) anymore. There were some really disorientating fight scenes where the use of strobe lights was way overdone and headache inducing.Any feminist who watches this movie will be blown away by the absurd amount of machismo in this... men posture and posture more, while the women cower in fear and wait to be saved. A minor exception is a bounty hunter girl who is featured along with the rest of her nameless crew. Dame Vaako is put in her place early by a man saying exactly that, but proves herself to be, well, a little more than a sex object as she starts to convince Vaako to overthrow the throne with her. Yay, stereotypical evil woman in tightfitting clothing. That look like they hurt for that matter. Kyra made even less sense, as in the beautiful long haired acrobatic girl who can apparently take care of herself, then still needs Riddick to come save her at least three times in the movie. Was there anything in this movie that wasn't stereotypical? *yawns* The ending, which was an ending I actually quite enjoyed, I was already so jaded by the rest of the movie to care much. In conclusion this is a horribly written, horribly constructed, disjointed light show with stilted dialogue and wooden performances. If you must watch this movie watch it for the few times that the cinematography breaks out of headache inducing mode and actually shines, as well as some of the special effects, because you aren't going to get much else out of Chronicles of Riddick.",The Chronicles of Riddick

This is fully fleshed out and finally, Riddick is given a background. Riddick is seriously cool and Vin Diesel plays him to perfection. He kicks @ss.

402,orgaenic,Please read: Sci Fi at it's end?,10,23 June 2004,"...and I don't say that because I think the movie is poor. I actually think that The Chronicles of Riddick is one of the best Sci Fi productions since the original Star Wars, and it's not even produced by George Lucas (Thank God). What we have here is a genre coming to it's end, and one of the best movies I've seen in a while will surmise that. Yes, I'm referring to Riddick. Not only have they created a mythology of a not-so-popular anti-hero and explored a universe of epic proportions with that, but they have done it extremely well. The concept of Jack (Kyra) as the emotional core of one of the coldest criminals in the universe is kept minimal (up to the end), but it is detectable and carried out with precision. The worlds depicted are the most original to date, and better grasp the ideas of how different other life-sustaining planets might be like. Yet one of two things are happening: people just aren't liking it or they're not seeing it. I have one guess as to why they aren't seeing it (assuming they are avid Sci Fi fans, like myself): Critics.All these critics out here have nothing better to do than what they think of as their jobs and go by a set system as to why they think a movie is not good or has plot holes. What the hell is a plot hole anyway? And what movie doesn't have them? It seems to me that a plot hole only comes to the awareness of someone when they don't have the imagination to fill it. Originality? I haven't seen an original movie in much time. I know some that have come fairly close, but no clove. Care for the characters? Since when is it necessary for a movie to have to make you care about the characters? And why is it a bad thing when you don't?So many questions that I know will never be answered, but only one really drills me in the head: How in God's good name can a movie called Dodgeball rake in 30 mil in it's first weekend, while this movie gets a 65% decrease in the same timeframe? Is this what people really want to see? All I can say is that when ""Sir Sci Fi"" leaves the building kicking and screaming with ""Mr. Comedy"", ""Mr. Drama, and ""Mrs. Romance"" laughing out of their seats, I hope that I never have to hear anyone ask, ""What happened to space movies? You know, like Star Wars! Oh well, I'll just go watch that new Will Ferrel movie."" ;)",The Chronicles of Riddick
403,SciFiBuf,Excellent sequel to a cult classic even if not fully appreciated!,9,27 February 2012,"I thought Chronicles of Riddick was one of the best ever science fiction drama movies ever made. It was an excellent follow-up sequel to Pitch Black, another cult classic in its own right.The acting in the movie by Vin Diesel and the other relatively well known actors such as Judy Dench, Colm Feore, Thandie Newton and Keith David were excellent. Even the relatively unknown actors like Karl Urban, Alexa Davalos, and Nick Chinlund, I thought were fantastic. The one liners used by some of the characters were truly memorable. They are numerous and you would have to watch the movie to appreciate them. This movie also helped the careers of some of actors I have just mentioned.The central plot of the movie with the ""Necromongers"" and their society waging war against humanity across the universe was genuinely innovative in its content. It was not a copy over from the various different ""Invasion from Mars"" movie genre over the years, but truly innovative in its overall theme and play on symbols. The movie offered a carefully integrated high tech / low tech combination which made it very interesting in its scope, and subliminally seductive in its appeal to a futuristic action drama taking place in a far off planetary system in hostile universe. The religious overtones and medieval backdrop of activity and close action combat taking place on Helion Prime was breathtaking and truly captivating. The various different twists and turns on the scenes and action sequences kept me riveted to the screen throughout the movie without a moment of boredom. In addition, I thought the movie sets were very carefully crafted, very well done and very appealing to the imagination.Things I would have done differently would be as follows: (1) include the deleted sequences that were in the DVD, but not on the final production copy – they would have gone a long way in explaining some things that people had a hard time filling in the blanks for during the movie, especially making a connection between Riddick and Aereon and Imam (for the audience less inclined to use their imagination they would have helped); (2) showed a little more detail on the blood and gore on the Crematoria combat scene to enhance realism – I honestly thought that sanitizing that scene especially was so destructive to the overall value of the movie that it made the movie less appealing, just like removing the important scenes from the production copy that were included in the DVD; (3) include a little more epidermis on the part of the participants during the steamy love scenes between Vaaco and Dame Vaaco while they were on the Necropolis ship (that would have added to the appeal of the movie significantly given the probable age of the audience), during the travel to Crematoria by the crew by Riddick and his female captor who removed his glasses while everyone else was sleeping (another missed opportunity), and on the part of either Kyra or Riddick or both while showering in the Crematoria prison (Riddick watching Kyra showering from a distance from the back would have been really interesting and exotic). Those additions would have probably earned an 'R' rating, but I don't see how this movie could have appealed to the Star Wars and Serenity crowd anyway. That's the popcorn and kool-aid crowd and this movie should have been designed from the beginning as appealing to a more mature and sophisticated audience that could integrate a complex theme along with all of the other more appealing content. Machiavellian drama set in the future, with the usual sprinkling of seduction, and unprecedented violence and slaughter taken to a new level of horror would have been just what the Doctor ordered. This movie is something unique like Alien or Blade Runner with a lot more people drama involving a renegade civilization seeking to convert or kill everyone in their path to eternal glory. Unfortunately, it got pruned a little too heavily and sanitized a little too much before final delivery.I think most of the critics got this movie wrong. This movie belongs on the same level as 'Blade Runner' – original, stimulating, with breathtakingly beautiful scenes and filled with a great deal more top quality acting, and originality in theme and plot, than any movie in its genre in recent memory. Every now and then a movie comes along of such exquisite quality that most critics miss it completely because it goes right over their heads. This is one of them. The critics were looking for popcorn and kool-aid, but instead they got filet mignon and a great vintage bottle of wine.",The Chronicles of Riddick

I was surprised at the depth of the story line, almost inspiring me to go read the books (except I don't have the time :) Sure, some of the one-liners were corny, but Vin Diesels usually similar style actually fits the role of Riddick quite well.One caveat, I went in with low expectations which may have boosted my overall impression.

That's what made it cool.The Chronicles of Riddick is an attempt to give the anti-hero of Pitch Black a bigger playground and more interesting enemies. It succeeds, to a degree...Pitch Black showed the redemption of an evil man through the sacrifice of another. Riddick learned to feel responsibility for others, and in this movie that responsibility is played out. The world (galaxy?) this movie is set in is very imaginative, and a good 'fit' for Riddick, full of crazymad people trying to get in his way.Some have called it overblown and melodramatic, but I think that's what the creators were going for! I mean, come on, Necromongers? The Underverse? Who seriously thinks this was meant to be anything BUT melodramatic? This is entertainment, people.Now the bad part: Universal took a movie that would have been great, and seemingly did everything they could to make it fail. Badly edited to get a PG-13 rating, the fights seem jumpy at times, and the lack of ""harsh"" language seems out of place. The story also has some strange holes in it, because some idiots decided to slice and dice it, catering to the lowest common denominator (which now seems to be a boiled carrot). You can see part of that simply from the scenes that appear in the trailers, but not in the movie. Before the hack job, this movie verged on Fantasy. And after all that ""work"" to make this a more ""widely appealing"" movie, they released it right after Harry Potter 3 and Shrek 2, assuring that many people with kids would be too poor to go to another movie.And despite all that, I still give it a high score, because what _is_ there is great, and I'm sure the DVD will be better.It's a shame it isn't doing better money-wise, because the material exists to tell further stories in this universe, and I would find that far more exciting than yet another James Bond/Star Wars/SNL-Castaway movie.",The Chronicles of Riddick

How WRONG can they be?! Vin Diesel was a genius to accept this part and is the very soul of John Riddick himself. Who else can step in and fill his shoes as effectively? No one I can think of. TCOR has one of the most complete back stories and well rendered universes I've ever seen in a sci-fi series, and I've seen and followed almost all of them. The casting, sets and storyline of the Necromongers are all very believably eerie, sufficiently alien to capture your attention, and disturbingly brilliant. Twohy and his set designers are masters of the craft. Some of the darkest concepts in all of SciFi are touched upon including the tearing of the soul from the body, the ""Underverse"", the spiritual realm and entities including ""Elementals"", the pursuit of empire and the forced subjugation of races via technology and the annihilation of entire worlds, and the lust for power. The acting was believable and engaging for the material at hand. I particularly enjoyed the professional ""rivalry"" between Riddick and the bounty hunter Toombs. One of more memorable scenes was during the turnover of the prisoner on Crematoria, Riddick yells up to Toombs to ""take the money!!"" but stubbornly he holds out for more. Of course, it all goes horribly wrong and he realizes it too late and says ""I should of taken the money!"" This reminds me of a lot of situations in life when I should of ""taken the money"" and walked, but instead I stuck around and tempted fate for too long, only to lose it all, not realizing the value of what I had in hand.

However all of those I did not like). The movie, to me and my very picky movie going friends saw it as how Sci-Fi should be. One friend commented 'It's the Lord of the Rings of Science Fiction'. I actually agree with that comment. When I read sci-fi, I picture such grand things they could never be done well in a movie. And this was done well, this had the grand vision. There were at least 4 completely realized planets in it, excellent characters, humor, one-liners that at least made sense, and absolutely stunning production design. My hats off to Holger Gross (The PD of Stargate).Some of the editing of the film was a bit off, and that's really my only complaint. Parts were edited too fast or just plain weird. But I could see the reason for doing them the way they did; they just didn't work (sort of like Hulk in parts).I'm actually curious whether there's some sort of paid smear campaign against this movie, because the amount of bad reviews just do not make sense to me.

Forget about Fast and Furious - Ridick is the best Vin Diesel performance :)It's a must see for Sci/Fi fans.I have never seen fresh Sci/Fi idea since. I hope there are many talented people out there with Sci/Fi scenarios ready to be filmed. Give them a chance, please. 10/10",The Chronicles of Riddick
412,luismanuelbatista,A warning!,6,8 September 2010,"When I saw this movie I wasn't expecting a thing. Which was a good thing because it turned to be a great film.I read some opinions here at IMDb and I find out some people didn't like it because there should be something, a film, a book, a cartoon, something as an argument between Pitch Black and Chronicles. Actually there's a cartoon called ""Chronicles of Riddick: Dark Fury"" between those two movies and it explains all the lines in this movie.For those who never heard of it check it out, maybe you'll change your mind, because it's rare these days a very consistent story has this chronicles.",The Chronicles of Riddick
413,cwfan111,Brilliant!!,10,17 June 2004,"Do not listen to the obnoxious reviewers who bashed this movie. It is in line with Demolition Man, Total Recall and Judge Dredd as a solid action movie/dystopia. Of course it has some cheesy lines but considering the state of current action movies this is far above and beyond any other movie this year. Solid action movies rely on the element of cheese or humor in order to make the story and action sequences that much better. If it didn't have its absurdity it would make the movie a dramatic action film, and that is well beyond Vin's abilities. I loved this movie for the great sequences, strong heroine and as a sequel (I was not a fan of Pitch Black) it surpassed the original and is an entirely different category. After the ugliness that was XXX, this movie has restored my faith in Vin's capabilities as an action star. Can't recommend it enough, will be going back to see it again soon.",The Chronicles of Riddick
414,bc5990,Coming in with low expectations TCOR was satisfying,10,12 June 2004,When I saw the previews for this I thought it was going to be terrible. The plot looked stupid and I thought I'd see it for the sake of seeing the sequel to Pitch Black. After seeing it a couple night ago I was pleasantly satisfied with movie. I thought it was a good action/sci/fi movie that is worthy of seeing. Like I thought though the plot was pretty dumb. The action was pretty unrealistic (even for a sci/fi movie) although it was definitely entertaining. Another problem I had with the film was that it was a fantasy film for than a Sci/Fi. It had gods and elementals in it and I thought it would be better if it was just a more realistic future. Like I said it was and entertaining movie and I would recommend it to anyone. I thought it was good and will probably buy it on DVD. (Mainly because I buy every movie that I thought wasn't terribly bad). It does have characters from the original so I recommend you see Pitch Black first. My rating for this movie is 6/10,The Chronicles of Riddick
415,Afruschman,Vin Diesel at his best!,9,14 September 2019,"This is movie is a creative masterpiece that has worlds so interesting, and so relevant politically that I never tire of viewing it. The bounty hunter, the young officer with his hot ambitious wife, and the evil supreme leader with a deep history of violent domination make this a very entertaining film.

416,jamesannand,One of the worst films I have ever seen!,1,7 August 2004,"This movie was crap!I really hope Judi Dench got paid a lot of money to put her name to this.It starts off slow and boring and (at least it is consistent!) stays that way till the end. Even the action bits are not interesting.David Twohy (Writer/Director) must have watched ""Dune"" just before making this and decided to end it like ""Conan"". (What do you expect from the guy who wrote G.I. Jane...!?!)The cinematography is boring! It is shot like a play, all static camera moves (someone got a new Tripod for Xmas). The dialogue is appalling. The story is full of holes and has been done soooooo many times before. The bad guys act like the Borg, Sound like Dune and look and move like Planet of the Apes. Vin Deisel should have stuck with the Fast & Furious franchise (or even XXX) this is such a poor movie and the Character of Riddick would not inspire anyone to follow him. Deisel cannot muster enough acting ability to engage an audience in this movie and I reckon I saw the shot of him looking over his shoulder (with a smoldering look on his face) at least 8 times.Pitch Black was an okay re-write of Aliens but The Chronicles of Riddick is just a boring film with no redeeming qualities whatsoever.I would recommend you avoid this garbage at all costs.....(And for the record, The Rock, beats Deisel hands down in Walking Tall in acting ability, muscle tone, dialogue delivery etc etc, if you are looking for the next ""Arnold"" or Action Star, Rock is the man, Deisel has missed the boat by passing on the two parts that suited him and opted for an Anti-hero, that he cannot even pull off convincingly....)1 Star out of 10 (for the CG Backgrounds)",The Chronicles of Riddick
417,keats2000,The most hyped waste of money ever,1,3 May 2005,"Though you have a huge budget for computer animation and the look of the movie is really quite good. The two downfalls of this movie are the horrible script and the bad acting. First the script is horrible because David Twohy has no idea what he is doing when it comes to writing, especially when it comes to writing a story that is supposed to be ""epic"". As you were watching it you see that Mr. Twohy is trying to make the history of the Riddick universe this large-scale and detailed story, with how different races interact with each other, like Star Wars, or Star Trek and Lord of the Rings. The only difference between this movie and those is this movie sucked and the story plays out like it was written by 1000 monkeys on a 1000 typewriters only instead of waiting a thousand years for Shakespeare they took the first story written. Like the NecroMongers, Loosely translated means people who like Death, or how the Underverse is the opposite of the Universe, and so on. Now that is what I call subtle writing. These innuendos are too easy to figure out that it takes you out of the rest of the badly written story. The story is full of holes in the plot that make this a very bad movie, like when Kyra dies and Riddick is sad over her death for like two seconds before he completely forgets about her and leaves her corpse lying there while he sits on the throne as the new Lord Marshal. So they have him fighting off this evil race of people that is going around killing everyone and thing in their way and when he finally kills their leader instead of stopping them as a threat he becomes their leader. Its like Winston Churchill leading the Nazis after the death of Hitler, it doesn't make sense. The writing in this movie is so amateurish it's embarrassing for David Twohy. And my writing in here may also be amateurish but i'm not writing a multimillion dollar movie. And when you get actors such as Colm Feore, Judi Dench, and even Thandie Newton and Karl Urban to act in this the story should not be this below average. You can tell that Judi Dench and Colm Feore were just there for the money because their performances (though the best in the movie) were hard to watch because you know how well they can act and to see them in this is like watching a Corvette being entered into a demolition derby. You can see that their performances are uninspired and you don't blame them. I will still watch any movie with those actors. But the person doing their absolute best job acting in the movie was Vin Diesel and for him it was really good, but even when compared to Ben Affleck, Vin Diesel's acting is horrible. This movie like all Vin Diesel movies makes you wonder who is watching them to make them this popular. And it's no wonder that Vins character in Saving Private Ryan was the first to go, save the best for last. This movie and every copy of it should be burned to save future generations of wasting 2 hours of their life on such absolute mind-numbing crap.",The Chronicles of Riddick
418,SKLundy,Is sci-fi doomed?,7,11 June 2004,"In all seriousness, practically every sci-fi movie ever to emerge has become a cult film and not a lot more (even if that cult eventually spreads to other generations.) Exceptions might be the original Star Wars flicks and perhaps the original Matrix.Science fiction is the least accepted form of literature and also the least understood genre in the movie-making world. Hate-reviews of sci-fi films will usually contain such a phrase as ""This movie made no sense."" How close-minded are we?What, I ask, is wrong with fantastical worlds, settings, and films? True, The Lord of The Rings Trilogy did rise above the natural prejudice (dude greatly to the commercialism and cheapening of a magnificent work of literature)--but most movies which head into the realm of science fiction are destined to have a faithful following... but also doomed to be hated by everyone else. Minority Report (an excellent movie) did quite well, but Tom Cruise sells any film of any style to the unbelieving prosaic masses...These people have trouble grasping any reality that does not directly conform to their own; it is hard for me to imagine such limited minds--ones only able to feed or learn off redundancy. Fiction is a ""lie"" we choose to believe to learn a truth; science fiction is just another such medium or (to degrade its potential) form of entertainment. In any case, this movie will be rated not on its originality or power, but simply on the genre. Whether or not you liked the movie, rate it fairly--do not destroy an outlet for creativity.",The Chronicles of Riddick
419,bettyboarder55,thoroughly enjoyed the film,9,24 June 2004,"though it was rated PG13 and therefore contained much less gore and without the cursing Riddick wasn't at his best, it was an amazing movie. I can't wait for the other two movies come out to complete the trilogy (wishful thinking). I've seen TCoR 3 times already and am going to see it again in a couple days; I strongly recommend it to sci-fi fans as well as anyone who loves high-adrenaline fights. I was not disappointed at all and think it was well worth the money. Unfortunately by not naming Pitch Black in the advertising many people did not realize this was a sequel so if you enjoy it please tell everyone you know. Word of mouth is a necessity here to fund the next two and make The Chronicles of Riddick the trilogy I am so desperately awaiting. If you haven't already, I recommend watching Pitch Black before seeing this movie. It'll help you to know the characters of Riddick and ""Jack.""",The Chronicles of Riddick

That said....Unless you saw Pitch Black, it would be very easy to get lost in the constant references to ""her"" and the relationship between the characters. The plot was thinnly laid, and jumpy throughout the movie. But if you know who Riddick is, then it is much easier to like this movie. I didn't go to see it because it looked like an awesome movie, I went to see Riddick again. And the director didn't mess him up anywhere near as bad as I was afraid he would. He still posseses the same attitude... basically... that he had in the first one. A little too much caring for others than I thought was appropriate, but enough to suggest a real bond was formed in the first film. It was not a jaw dropping stunner of a movie, but it wasn't the Cat in the Hat either. It is a solid GOOD movie. If you know the character, then you will like it more than someone who has no idea who Riddick is. So go enjoy a high 6, low 7 movie. And don't expect to see the Godfather type acting.Oh... and pray the DVD version includes the parts that would help make it less jumpy. But that's just my opinion...

Love the sexual tension that is created between them and more importantly: their love for one another;Can't really be bothered by special effects normally, but the effects in the Chronicles are fresh, original and very very good! That in combination with an actual story (I was kind of missing story lines since the last two Star Wars - movies = only effects no emotions) -and the end of the movie: Riddick as Lord Marshal, what a sight!- is what makes this a great movie.And I definitely would like to be able to float like Judi!",The Chronicles of Riddick
422,kikumifu,"a good, mindless start to the summer",8,13 June 2004,"When I told my friends that I was going to go see the Chronicles of Riddick on the big screen, they looked at me with a mixture of confusion and horror. Why would I want to see a movie that was so obviously bad? They must have forgotten that I went to Triple X last year voluntarily as well. And I had lots of fun at that too.All the critics have been bashing this movie, calling it, in so many words, an empty-sci-fi-action-thriller-cheese-fest. And I would agree with all of those. But what is wrong with that? Summer movies are meant to be mindless. And this is definitely the one to set the mood for the summer.Science-fiction movies (with the exception of a solid handful) are going to be cheesy. You can't attend these movies with your thumb up your butt waiting for Sean Penn or Julianne Moore to move you. The thing that I usually can't take is when -do- take themselves seriously. Nothing is worse than a laughable movie that can't even make you laugh.Now, I admit myself to being fond of Vin Diesel. He is, by far, the best corny-summer-action-flick actor out there. Not by acting standards, but for these flicks acting and plot (obviously) usually take a back seat to corny dialogue and sweet special effects. He's the only one of them who doesn't take himself completely seriously, at least. Summer action movies are meant to be just that - summer action movies. This is a crucial point that too many critics refuse to acknowledge. I, for one, stand up for Vin. I went to this movie to have a mindless good time, and I did just that.

423,tuxmaska,A Proud Tradition Continues,2,11 June 2004,"For those of you who loved the over-the-top action inherent in mindless tripe like ""XXX,"" you may have just found a winner in this movie. This movie is your typical bill of affair Vin Diesel movie. Pretty much, he's the same smooth-talker known for his epic dialogue that is he is in every other movie he has ever starred in. This movie started out like it was gonna be good, but went downhill when Diesel first opened his mouth. Of particular disinterest in this movie is how it constantly wanders from place to place, without doing pesky things like ""developing the plot"" or attempting continuity. Why did Riddick go to Helion Prime? Why did he later go to Crematoria? Why do these names sound like they were ripped right out of ""Thundercats"" or ""Transformers?"" Unfortunately, the only ""robot in disguise"" would (sadly again) be Diesel, attempting to play a protagonist yet again. The other characters in this movie weren't really developed enough to deserve mention (another hallmark of a classic Vin Diesel flick), and those with acting ability, such as Keith David, were assured only the most minor, if not non-existent roles. He DOES have a reputation to uphold, after all. Many times, I found myself going into apoplexy with laughter, either at the dialogue or at the ridiculous in-no-way-corresponding-to-reality action scenes where everything explodes.

Me (quoting Riddick): If you say so A lot of people haven't liked this movie and I have to ask myself why? If we can have Harry Potter doing so well in the box office why not Riddick? Then I realized whybecause apparently when you grow up you have to trade in your imagination for blinders and see only our world and our jobs and reality. No longer can we be swept away by our imaginationto a place where Riddick livesa place with Necromongers, Crematoria, Furians, Elementals. Because all of these names are too simplistic. Couldn't they be a little more creativebecause I know that we areI mean when we call people black and white by the color of their skin? Maybe keeping it simplistic isn't that bad of a thing? I know, it's 'not cool' to enjoy a movie where you have to actually use your imagination and maybe let go of science for once. I have been teased for actually thoroughly enjoying this movie by my own sister. She realizes though that we all have our little 'guilty pleasures' and so I guess if It's not cool to like this movie then this will be my 'guilty pleasure'. At least I'm enjoying myself in the process. So I hope that more people will go out and see this movie (in secret if you feel the need) because I give it an 8/10. For all the special effects (which is one thing that even the people putting the movie down like), for Riddick (my favorite fictional character, and I'm not a huge Vin fan but he was MADE for this part), for the story line that will hopefully evolve in future movies, etc. So I guess because I like the movie I'm a dork and not intelligent and am thus a big kid. To that I again replyIf you say so",The Chronicles of Riddick
425,GUCliff,"Great sequel to ""Pitch Black""",10,14 June 2004,"Wow! Just saw this last night and it far exceeded my expectations. From the moment Vin Diesel (Riddick) first opens his mouth he owns this film (""You made three mistakes...."") He was great in ""Pitch Black,"" which was a good, but not great, sci-fi flick. I was doubtful that a sequel could really work, but I was excited to hear about it nonetheless (plus, some of the later trailers looked pretty cool.) The plot was interesting (hey, if you're gonna have Riddick fight something, have him at odds with an army of planet conquerors/invaders!) The set designs also looked very Lynch ""Dune"" inspired. It was also cool to see some of the characters from ""Pitch Black"" resurface and play vital roles (it's always great to see Keith David). With this flick, Riddick now stands alongside Snake Plissken as an ultimate badass anti-hero (wonder who'd win in a fight.) Several memorable lines (there are many) include Riddick's ""back of the bus"" statement, ""It's an animal thing,"" and after being told that he killed one of the best bad-guy (necromonger) soldiers, ""If you say so."" And a flick always gets extra bonus points when a bad guy yells out the name of the hero (the head mercenary yelling ""RIDDICK!!!"" while caged up with the dog-things). Moments like that are so over-the-top they're great...and make no mistake, this flick is over-the-top (which is good for this type of movie). Let's also not forget the awesome final scenes, which owe a little to ""Conan the Barbarian,"" as we find Riddick an unlikely ruler/king, now with a badass army at his disposal. Let's hope that we see another ""chronicle"" in the near future. ""I'm with you"" Riddick. Great pulp sci-fi.",The Chronicles of Riddick

Vin Diesel seems to give a greater performance in Sci-Fi movies like Pitch Black and the Chronicles of Riddick rather than action movies like the Fast and the Furious or Triple X or it might just be because of the other cast members in the movies.

427,sirwonko,"Decent CGI, Decent Action, Lousy Acting",4,28 June 2004,"Storyline is a bit weak. Riddick goes looking for a way to get the bounty off his head, and gets caught up in a local apocalypse -- a reluctant hero type of storyline. Unfortunately, Riddick is pretty much an anti-hero, and as Judi Dench's character tells us from the beginning, we're basically watching evil vs. evil... so who cares?For drama, one must care about the characters. This movie gives us nothing to chew on, so we yawn when the various major characters die.The acting is atrocious; to be fair, some of the lines are awful, and no amount of acting could save those particular scenes. Each of the principal actors, individually, are more capable than what you see in ""Riddick"" -- I can only surmise that, dramatically, this movie was killed by a bad script, rather than any lack of ability on the part of the actors. Even Judi Dench couldn't save the scenes she appeared in.The CGI is well done... almost too well-done. ""Riddick"" shares ""Matrix 3's"" Achilles heel -- the CGI is too disconnecting. At some point, we have to believe that the action is actually affecting the characters; I left this movie feeling the same way I did about Matrix 3: That I had just sat and watched somebody else play a video game for a couple of hours.Too much noise, too many strobes, too many fight scenes so chopped up that you cannot tell what is happening to whom.

I loved the fast variation in the film. We went from cool ice to steaming lava within 40 minutes. The underground slam and the gorgeous designed necromonger space ships and battleships were amazingly done! The art work was absolutely breath taking inside of the ships.The only bad part I thought was that it went a bit too fast, perhaps due to the cutting of the film to make it PG-13.

429,smarmonk,Enjoyed the film...a little uneven,8,5 July 2004,"I did enjoy this film. I thought it was a little uneven and some of the decisions made would not play well with a USA audience. I would like to have seen Ariel's character fleshed out and have seen her played as a more threatening/frightening character. After all, she has the power to predict the future. I thought most of the performances were very good, especially Vin Diesel and Judy Dench. I think the producers may have bitten off more than they can chew trying to create an entire universe in one movie while at the same time maintaining a somewhat complex and interesting plot line.Back to US audiences. The fight scenes were too realistic in terms of how quickly they passed and not realistic enough in the amount of blood shown. US audiences a) want the gore and b) have no clue how quickly a fight is over, once started. There are other places in the film that this is an issue as well.The European atmosphere that should have brought back visions of Nazi Germany or Mussolini were fantastic...my son and I really enjoyed them. The rest of the audience was pretty confused and didn't make that connection. We're not talking about a well-educated populace here compared to the rest of the industrialized nations.Hope another installment is in the making in spite of the face this one did not rake in the money.

The special thing about this movie is that every 10 minutes there is something new: new planets, new creatures, new weapons, new costumes, everything to satisfy hunger for a good sci-fi interplanetary adventure. The work of the production designer is outstanding. This is a great sci-fi action movie no more no less. That's why you won't find here any philosophical discussions or deep character investigation. No. Only adventures. The only disappointment of this movies is the way fight scenes were shot: close-ups mostly. I don't think that it was done because Vin Diesel can't fight but just because to leave some brutal moments off screen.At last I should say that it's not necessary to watch Pitch Black to enjoy Chronicles of Riddick. They are absolutely different movies in all aspects. My grade is ""A"".",The Chronicles of Riddick
431,tho_ped,Awful performances from weak actors,2,29 August 2004,"This is probably one of the worst sci-fi movies I have ever seen. First of all, it has no ironic distance to itself and therefore ends up taking itself way to seriously. Additionally, the performances from the actors are worse than bad. Most notably, Vin Diesel totally kills the movie with his pathetic attempts to be as cool as possible rather than bringing some depth to the movie. I know that Vin Diesel is considered a great talent but so far I have steared clear of his films because I have found it hard to believe that he had any talent what-so-ever, and nothing I saw in this movie convinced me otherwise. Furthermore, there is absolutely no spark between the main actors, which totally kills the viewers' belief in the relationship between Jack/Kyra and Riddick. Generally, I would say that on the acting part ""The Chronicles of Riddick"" ranks only fractions higher than ""Plan 9 From Outer Space""...If you want to see this movie, do so for the effects alone and forget about the main part of the actors (some of the actors with smaller parts actually do a decent job) and certainly forget about the story which is weak, to say the least.2/10",The Chronicles of Riddick
432,c-cathrine,An excellent and much needed film.,9,4 September 2004,"'The Chronicles of Riddick' seems to be receiving unfair flak. I can understand why in most cases, but I question whether some of the critics have seen the film. After all, it can hardly be considered a 'nominal sequel', as one critic stated. There is nothing nominal about it, when compared with 'Pitch Black'. A 'nominal' sequel to this film would no doubt take some people back to the planet it was set on, and face the same monsters again - and more of them. Most likely, the people would not be at all related to the first film. That is the suit that most sequels follow - more of the same. Chronicles is certainly not this. In fact, it is hardly a sequel at all - which is perhaps why it has never once been pegged as one.Many have complained about the lack of character development. Fair enough. However, it's not needed, and if you would like, there is an entire film dedicated quite separately to the character development of Riddick - 'Pitch Black'. Still, I would contend that Riddick's character develops a fair bit during the film - for crying out loud the guy is crying at the end of the film! I had hardly imagined that possible even having seen 'Pitch Black', yet I did not question it at all by the end of Chronicles.As to the weak plot, does Star Wars have a strong one? If you say Chronicles doesn't, then I would argue that few if any sci-fi operas, or epic fantasy films have. I actually found it quite absorbing, and felt the story was very full. Many have complained about the place names, but lets be honest, those are exactly the sorts of names our society would give! Just look at the American West if you want proof! This alone makes the universe in this movie seem more connected to ours.Admittedly the talent is not taken full advantage of, but as this film was intended as part of a trilogy (as yet unmade), with 'Pitch Black' as a separate but connected tale (like 'the Hobbit' is to 'Lord of the Rings', according to Vin Diesel), it would be expected that more would be seen of these characters in later installments. When taken in this context, the film serves as an excellent introduction to a larger story and some of its principle players. Certainly, Star Wars IV was no better - and perhaps a damn sight worse (acting and direction were not the greatest, lets be fair).Considering the current state of mind bogglingly unoriginal and empty fantasy and comic book films which seem to have dominated the market for the last few years, it is a breath of fresh air to find a space opera with beautiful art direction and imagery. It's also nice to find a film on such a scale that is not childish, and is wonderfully dark. No doubt this will affect its box-office takes, especially in countries such as the UK where the rating will not allow all ages entry. Still, I hope it passes the fabled sequel money boundary, and we see the other two films made. The story looks to be epic, and I very much look forward to see where its going. It is certainly less predictable than the Matrix trilogy.",The Chronicles of Riddick

Now really good special effects, but (Keep in mind I'm an artist and I do some CG) they kind of rushed on some of the parts. I'm glad I didn't see this movie in the theater. Within the first 30mins there was so much flashing and zip and zaps in the movie I would of had an seizure right there. Vin Diesel need some work with his fighting and a lot of work with his acting. Honeslty when I first started watching this I said to myself ""Omg this needs to be on the sci-fi channel"". It had that feeling of a TV made movie, you know?

It was well written, with truly compelling dialogue. The relationships were complex, and the story was as well. I would recommend reading Twohy's script for Alien III too. It's a great Prison Planet piece. Some similarities between his Alien III universe and that of Riddicks'. The visuals are, of course, one of the best aspects of this flick. I found them evocative of some of the big-budget biblical movies, like Ben-Hur, or Cleopatra, etc. Even some Harryhausen qualities in their massive devourment of the screen.

Basically, if you don't need your hand held through the story, you will find your own way through it. It's deliriously logical!! Enjoy! And the sequel had better happen. I saw this with my Dad, and he's old, and he loved it. If your not familiar with Twohy, check out Below, it's a great submarine ghost movie. Very authentic WWII submarine warfare with a fun ghost story onboard. I admit, I love submarine flicks, and Below succeeded in that genre. The ending was a bit over the top, but that doesn't mean CoR was over the top, I still like that ending. Buy Chronicles of DVD asap, it will have 5.1 SS, I promise.",The Chronicles of Riddick
436,graygr,Awesome Sci-fi Flick,8,19 November 2004,"A slow start to an exciting Sci-fi movie. Typical plot, typical ending a few twists and turns that kinda kept me on the edge of my seat.I would put this movie among one of my favorite sci-fi movies along with Starship Troopers, Independence Day. It's eye catching special effects were outlandishly unreal, fight scenes a little on the Matrix side, but I didn't feel cheated by them. It gave the movie a great thrill aspect. It was a fun movie with lots eye interaction, A lot of great looking guys for the women, a few great looking women for the men. All around I think I will keep this one as a Saturday special watch again and again classic. I rate this movie an eight out of ten. And the only reason for that is the slow start of setting up the characters.",The Chronicles of Riddick

Then when he tries to get his soul Riddick makes a comeback .. only to get beaten down again! So having established our hero isn't good enough help shows up, and Kyra is killed off just because - well I really don't know. There is no point.If Twohy wants to make arty films with torturous rubbish like that in then he can go ahead with the tiny budget that any studio will give him after this disaster. Especially as he already pulled this trick at the end of Pitch Black (where at least there was a reason for it) - it's not original if you do it twice you know!!!Thankfully we won't have to see the next two anytime soon :)",The Chronicles of Riddick
438,killerkars,3 stars,6,29 December 2004,"I have to admit i knew exactly what kind of film i was getting before watching 'The Chronicles of Riddick' therefore i was not expecting superior acting, direction etc, however i was expecting to be entertained.Riddick did entertain me and i would not call it a bad film but i did feel it had some short comings which could have improved it greatly. First off i felt that we the viewer were given no time to identify with the worlds in which Riddick is set or the plight of their inhabitants, instead the film jumped straight into the action (which some might prefer). The same applied with the characters, i felt that they all lacked any kind of depth or charisma.....especially Riddick i found his narration of situations somewhat....blah, that goes for dialogue in general, i felt it was quite poor at times. The movie is a good looking piece however it generally relies on its special effects rather than a keen artistic cinema eye.Despite the short comings which can be forgiving as i don't think Twohy tried to push any barriers with his film. Vin Deisel fans will love this film, anyone looking for some easy Saturday night entertainment will like it, anyone looking to be inspired by film-making should stay clear....***",The Chronicles of Riddick

Everything that Riddick is doing is well thought and calculated. Also, I really loved how they pictured the necro. Strong civilization with no emotion wearing grey suits... Riddick was very entertaining and it kept me into it all movie long. I really liked the universe they created with the Crematoria prison. And trust me, I've seen a LOT of Sci-Fi over the year and this one is in my top 20 all-time way ahead of pitch black. I wouldn't compare it to classic Sci-Fi such Alien or Terminator, but it will surely be considered by the sci-fi lovers as a solid piece. Also, Vin Diesel is really bad ass in this one !!",The Chronicles of Riddick

Yes, of course there's intense and exciting action. Yes, there was immense care taken by the people who made this to have it be cohesive and convincing.But that's not it.What I like is the spirit of the thing.I am so UNBELIEVABLY fed up with that ""little public school boy"" good vs evil baby food of Star Wars and Lord of the Rings - I thought I was pretty sick of it but Pitch Black and then Chronicles revealed to me just HOW sick of it I was.The morals of this series is far more workable, realistic and in general interesting and that's what makes these movies fascinating and cult worthy. We go into a scene not being able to totally foretell that the guys in white will kick the stick out of the guys in black, even if we knew up front who was white or black in the first place, which we don't - thank GOD for that.It is highest, but super highest time that someone started to make movies and SciFi/fantasy movies in particular that speak to intelligent people who have lived a bit and have found that reality is a lot more complicated than just Orcs vs goodies and storm troopers vs lovely clean prepubescent Hansel and Gretel.The Chronicles team took on the challenge and they made a very good movie that works a treat. Well done all around, a big thumbs up and the only reason I didn't give 10 points is that I want to give them something even further to strive towards in 2 and 3 ...",The Chronicles of Riddick
441,nickav-1,A pleasant surprise,7,18 January 2005,"I approached this movie with caution, especially since it stars Vin Diesel, but was pleasantly surprised by it. Diesel's single-note performance worked for the role, I guess -- at the very least he didn't spoil the rest of the film for me. The pacing was exciting from start to finish, and the production design was quite good -- things felt truly alien and original. The plot was pretty dark and grim with very little scmaltz, and only a few unnecessary elements (like Dame Judy Dench....) I'd recommend this to anyone who is into sci-fi and/or action flicks. Go in with low expectations -- it's not exactly a classic -- and you won't be disappointed.",The Chronicles of Riddick
442,paul-1038,Excellent Film,10,8 August 2006,"Wow, what an adventure. Vin Diesel is rapidly lifting his profile in what would have been a difficult film to produce. As he also was involved in directing/producing the film he has shown quite a new level of depth in terms of making a real adventure film. After pitch black, CoR really lifted the bar and gave us an awful lot more adventure than I expected. Some truly great scenes were also in this film but just as a side note, I take issue with some of the ridiculous and insidious comments left on this film. If you didn't like it, then why bother trashing it?Some of the comments have tried to find every fault imaginable with the history of armies, religion, special effects and a whole host of other insignificant facts. Whilst I feel sorry for these people who feel the need to vent some kind of unhappiness akin to their lack of joy in their own lives; I must share the fact that I, and so many others like myself laugh uncontrollably at what I am guessing are a number of Springfields finest 'Comic Book Guys'. If you feel the need to utter the words ""worst film ever"" then I suggest a subscription to a LIFE.Again, a great film which had a lot of twists and turns that truly were entertaining from start to finish, and Vin Diesel really demonstrates his versatility as a tough guy kind of character. Before I hear utterances of typecast just remember that Arnie and Stallone were typecast too, before they got into some comedies. Additionally, before criticising Vin Diesel of anything remember to focus on the origin of said complaint; are you referring to his roles or jealous of his physique which is conducive to the tough guy roles?",The Chronicles of Riddick
443,markr-22,Chronicles of Riddick,8,22 July 2005,"We just rented Pitch Black and became interested in the character ""Riddick"" played by Vin Diesel. After renting the ""Chronicles of Riddick"" I felt it was well worth the rent. The plot may have been duplicated from some other movies, but there are only actually 12 plots that can be used at this point in time for ALL movies, so what can you expect? The action was really good, the acting wasn't too bad, the cast was a good pick and the character played by Vin Diesel should be seen some more in a few more upcoming ""Chronicles"" hopefully. My family of 4 boys enjoyed the movie as well as my wife and myself. Frankly, I do believe it WAS underrated. Do yourself a favor and ignore the negative comments that you may have heard and check out ""The Chronicles of Riddick"" for yourself and you decide. I enjoyed it!I'll be looking for a copy to add to our DVD collection. Good job Vin and cast!",The Chronicles of Riddick

Do not expect an ""oscar"" nominated performances or anything from the Royal Shakesphere Company. Just pure unadulterated heroistic enjoyment. The quintessential good bad-guy. The sets have that Gothic rust-belt look that you would expect in the far reaches of space. Great landscapes. Visual effects on the planet crematoria are off the charts The Necromancers represent the ultimate in futuristic Gothic evil. Vin D is Vin D at his best; the vehicle was made for him. Violence is there but not bloody. One of the few stories I can watch again and again. No real emoting....just great fun.",The Chronicles of Riddick
445,overtrick,Turns out Vin Diesel can't power this vehicle,2,15 February 2005,"I watched Pitch Black expecting a bad movie and was pleasantly surprised. I went into Chronicles of Riddick again expecting a bad movie and it still managed to make me regret having paid to see it. Even if I'd gotten in for free I would still regret having wasted two hours of my life watching it.So far as I can tell, the whole point of the movie is to illustrate repeatedly just how much of a bad*ss Vin Diesel's character is, while he shamelessly mugs for the camera. My suspension of disbelief finally imploded halfway through and I spent the rest of the movie observing plot holes while waiting for it to reach its inevitable conclusion.The rest of the cast seems to have taken their lead from Vin Diesel as all their performances are both over-the-top and mostly one-dimensional. That might simply be the script at fault again, though, as the dialogue is uninspired and the characters are occasionally incomprehensible in their actions.About to only good thing you can say about Chronicles of Riddick is that it does have some impressive visuals, but with the prevalence of CG now you can say that about most action movies and nearly all of them have scripts better than this one.",The Chronicles of Riddick
446,TexaninMD,Surprisingly GOOD MOVIE!!,9,16 June 2005,"I rented this with somewhat low expectations...and boy was I surprised! This movie is visually stunning and the action is well done. A lot of information is thrown at you from the beginning and Vin Diesel tends to speak in a low, hard to understand voice...but stick with it. Many of the details are repeated and clarified throughout the movie. This movie is lingering just below making the cut into my top 10 favorite movies... I'm not sure how this got such a bad rating either. I would assume there are people here in IMDb that just randomly rate movies based on concept or who is in it. But don't let the rating fool you. This movie kept me on the edge of my seat to say the least. But like I said before, STAY WITH IT. You actually need to watch and pay attention to the dialog between the action. I know it's rough for some of you Neanderthals, but you can do it!",The Chronicles of Riddick
447,foxxsden,Good for what it was meant to be.,8,25 March 2005,"This movie was good for what it was meant to be. A Sci-fi action flick. Vin Diesel maintains a steady hand at the character of Riddick, showing both growth and a certain loyalty to the character we met in the first movie (Pitch Black). The other actors in the film all are good fits, Thandie Newton's character was a rare and sly treat. And Keith Urban plays his role quite well. As for the special effects, I think they were very believable. Bringing you into each world and setting, just like good special effects should. The set design was excellent, wonderful detail. However, if sci-fi isn't your thing, I wouldn't suggest this as a movie you would probably enjoy. It's a pretty genre specific movie. If you are watching it on DVD, don't get too excited about the extras. I can't say any of them were all that great, no stunning insights there.",The Chronicles of Riddick

Very dark - I liked it.Good action - good moves. The guys hanging from the wings was a fun concept - but not for me :^) I loved the scene with the wolf thing.Too bad they shaved Van Diesel after the first scene. I was hoping they would keep him with the hair or the beard.Kept the character busy once he hit a planet. The concept of freezing during transit was spot-on. However, it was the only break they ever gave him.Loved the fight scene at the end - really cool effect. In general, I thought all of the fight scenes were pretty realistic.Good alien species - enough like humans for empathy, but weird enough for me. The elemental was a pretty unique alien, although I kept wishing she had a power to affect the real world, like cloud minds.I will watch it again several times. There are lots of good stuff in the background. Much better than the first/prequel movie, which I rented and tried to watch, but could not get into it.",The Chronicles of Riddick

450,drew_wert,Riddick Rocks,10,18 August 2005,Amazing Movie... I don't think that they could have done a better job in bringing pitch black and Riddick together. It had a complicated yet simple plot that you could follow even after only 2 hours of sleep. Not to mention Riddick's one liners that made this action packed movie almost a comedy. I believe that the younger teen generation to the older 40's could enjoy this. although I don't expect it to be on Fox Family anytime soon some could view it as a family movie. The special effects of this movie were amazing and they had to be coming out right after The Matrix series. It would be hard to decide which is better between the two. The cgi rendering was so incredibly detailed that you could no distinguish between computer animated and real life. I give this movie a 10 out of 10.,The Chronicles of Riddick

I wanted to see this when it came out in the theaters, and now I'm disappointed that I didn't. It portrays a heroic undertaking from a hardened character who shows us glimpses of the emotion and humanity that I love to see in action heroes. Although I haven't been what you would call a Vin Diesel fan by any means, watching him within this genre of movie has me liking what I see. The special effects were outstanding, as was the soundtrack. I found myself experiencing some of the same emotions I felt when watching Underworld and The Matrix. Excellent movie in my opinion.",The Chronicles of Riddick

Another amazing thing is that the whole move never saw light and was full CGI. This is a must see but only if you see the first movie... pitch black. Vin Diesel was a great actor he totally fit the bad boy image that the director was putting out or trying to cast with the main character. When you watch the movie on DVD there will be 2 options choose fight instead of convert because you will get to hear a short commentary by the Director himself.

I'm dying to know the rest of the story.This is a great film for those viewers who like story lines you can sink your teeth into. There is a great deal of foreshadowing and ""aftershadowing"" that hints at past and future story lines so that you feel as though you're getting a view into an ongoing mythology . The visual effects are incredibly beautiful, interesting, and imaginative, for those people who are H.R. Giger fans and like the Crow, Underworld, Blade, etc. I think you will find this to be (forgive the wording) refreshingly new.

454,Lofwyr,Space opera is back in town!,8,19 June 2004,"The Chronicles of Riddick came along just at the right time. With the Star Wars and Star Trek franchises being systematically ruined by the people responsible, this might as well be the Next Big Thing (tm) when it comes to space opera.The atmosphere is right, the effects are good, the sets and costumes are great, the (anti)hero is just as badass as it gets, the dialogue (while being cheesy, alright) is still miles above the drivel Lucas tortured his audience with in the Star Wars prequels... in short: in times like these, this movie comes across like a space opera fan's wet dream!When first hearing the title ""The Chronicles of Riddick"", I thought it sounded way too pompous and preposterous. After seeing the movie however, I no longer think so - this truly is the beginning of ""The Chronicles of Riddick"" (""Pitch Black"" being sort of a prelude). The ending leaves no doubt that Twohy's wants to make a sequel, and I for one am really curious where he will take us with the next movie.As for complaints that this movie rips off loads of stuff, mainly ""Dune"" and ""Conan""... I wouldn't say it rips those movies off, but it certainly is safe to say ""The Chronicles of Riddick"" was at least influenced by them.If you're dissatisfied with Star Wars and Star Trek in its current state and hunger for some decent action oriented SF / space opera, go see this movie.",The Chronicles of Riddick

What happened to the days of Sci-Fi being about positive characters? Riddick is the hero of this film and he's still a villain. All sci-fi now days is dark and none of the characters have any morals. Let's get back to Gene Roddenberry's vision of the future, a future that holds promise. Not this crap of mysticism and evil. Even Star Trek after Roddenberry died started taking on this dark side. DS-9 is a good example. None of the background of these characters was explained. What drove them to do what they were doing?

However, Tandy's Christina Milian impression is second only to Samantha Mumba's... who owe all their skills to Jaye Davidson in the far superior Stargate.Vin's relationship with the coca cola polars needed to be explored more.

457,goran-krmac,What a Waste,2,10 July 2006,"Although I'm a sci-fi lover, and I don't mind watching the occasional B-movie, I find Chronicles of Riddick a total disappointment.The underlying epic is presented very weakly: there is talk about the ""Underverse"", which is a ""promised land"" for one who converts to the Necromongers. It doesn't have any weight, the Necros could've as well just forcefully ""assimilated"" anyone.Since the Necros look suspiciously like Catholic crusaders from the Middle Ages and they attack a place called New Mecca, which obviously contains Muslim architectural and cultural elements, I thought the movie aimed at being a metaphor to the battling Catholic and Muslim religions in the last centuries of human history, each one seen as a ""different kind of evil"". This metaphor fails miserably quite early in the movie, as New Mecca slips out of the story almost completely. Also, the Necros end up being as intimidating as a bird flu pandemic: nasty, deadly, but surely not awe-inspiring.At first, Riddick appeared to be a comic-book hero, which made me genuinely think the movie was shot after a comic, which, as I found out later, wasn't the case. The reason for suspecting that in the first place was way too much Vin Diesel on screen, way too much attempt at a ""personality cult"" that doesn't work, simply because there isn't a personality being developed. All of the characters are shallow and predictable, and if unpredictability strikes, it's because an expected character development doesn't take place. Dame Vaako, for example, could've turned out to be the greatest evil, exerting control over her husband in a hunger for power. But After Riddick kills Lord Marshal, she and Vaako just turn quiet.There are numerous other shortcomings in plot, development and casting, but to cut it short, this movie just isn't convincing. It may be suitable for children (actually it should only be viewed by people UNDER 13 years of age), but a mature viewer won't find anything of interest here.",The Chronicles of Riddick

OF course it is obvious because I am writing this that I didn't fall asleep-in fact I really enjoyed the world that was brought into my living room. And bonus!--everyone could act!

Fingerprint terrain, temperature differential, slow motion action that never uses the excuse that ""this is a generated reality"".This comment is more about the character of Riddick. Any technical aspects of the movie are for another time.Riddick cannot lift 50 tons nor can he shoot lasers from his eyes or suck up energy from the sun so he can fly. He doesn't wear a costume designed to get attention, in fact his clothes do exactly the opposite. Riddick is interesting and succeeds by using that one thing we as humans beings all have. The absolute will to survive.His path made him a criminal to his universe. But he simply knows how to survive. He is the incarnation of the term ""survival of the fittest"" and he IS the fittest. All of his action are ambiguous, neither right or wrong. This means his choices can't be judged as right or wrong. There is no right or wrong in basic survival.A LION eating the BIRTH MOTHER of a baby gazelle is not acting as evil or doing something wrong. It's about survival.If you really pay attention, Riddick is the ONLY character without any agenda. He's perfectly content to remain a nobody but someone somewhere is always trying to make him a 'somebody'.He realizes attachment equals death because that takes him beyond just surviving. He has to make choices that INCLUDE others. He is continually presented with opportunities to grow in character. It's a perfect continuation of his choices in Pitch Black.",The Chronicles of Riddick

If the movie is too deep for the little people out there, that's their problem, but Riddick is the battle and war between good and evil.Who could not be moved at the end when Riddick takes down the Lord Marshall and inadvertently rests his weary body on the Throne of the Necromonger. And lo, they came and bowed before him pledging their allegiance.I am still overwhelmed by the power of this film. Who can forget the Life Run on Crematoria as the sun comes over the horizon, scorching the planet and incinerating every living thing unprotected by shadow. Riddick is confident and self-assured when everyone else is afraid. He is our strength in our time of need.Even he doesn't realize the power he wields. His strength is contagious and ultimately leads to freedom for those brainwashed by the Necromonger Way. Thank you Riddick, for being our everything!!!!",The Chronicles of Riddick

Bad guy, most wanted criminal in Galaxy is put in a role of messiah who from own will sacrifice him self to save world, oh give me a break.As if the stupid main plot (criminal saving world) wouldn't be enough nothing left form ""realistic"" settings of Pitch Black.

Riddick qualifies as this rarity. Riddick is: - an acrobat of both body and brains: ""poetry in motion"", yes; - an incorrigible rebel, with a cause; - unaware of the concepts 'fear', 'compromise', 'go with the flow', 'promising career', 'moral uncertainty'; - undaunted by authority of any kind; - so politically incorrect, it is like a breath of fresh air. Riddick does not give a hoot what anyone thinks of him, requires no speeches to explain himself, and refuses to submit to a most powerful religious organization that promises life, plus life in the hereafter, in exchange for submission and faithful service now. Yup, no ""Pay, Pray, and Obey"" for this baby. Don't mistake Riddick for a psychopath: he is a law unto himself, with no lawyers or jury in sight. Fighting him, the baddies often find themselves in the court of first and last appeal.

There was so much in the Riddick character that smacked of the original Conan, especially some of his poses in certain scenes. Remember the classic Conan image where he stands, muscles bulging... the conquering hero with the girl on the ground clutching his leg? Look for a comparable shot in the movie. You'll see it. Classic. I guess folks don't read those old books so much anymore. This movie had elements that smacked of quite a few other SciFi and fantasy books and movies to me and I thought that made it even more fun. It is fresh in its own right and well worth watching.I understand that folks had trouble switching gears from Pitch Dark to Riddick, the movies rather switched gears from a SciFi to something that was more fantasy despite the space ships... the movies had little flow between them except some set-up on the Riddick character. *shrug* Who cares?

It worked for me visually (even if following some of the storyline's backfill was a little confusing at times). I enjoyed ""Pitch Black"" very much and found this outing for Vin Diesel's dark, brooding character Riddick equally good knockabout fun. Riddick finds himself in constant jeopardy and the viewer is kept wondering how on earth he'll get out of it. That he does so, and in audacious, spectacular fashion, is part of the film's overall appeal. It's edge-of-the-seat stuff from beginning to end.The sets and special effects look stunning on high-definition TV - particularly close-ups of the Necromongers' body armour and the interior of their ships. While Riddick and Kyra (played by Alexa Davalos) steal the show, there are some solid supporting performances from the likes of Dame Judi Dench (Aereon), Colm Feore (Lord Marshall), Karl Urban (Vaako) and Thandie Newton (Dame Vaako).",The Chronicles of Riddick

Vin Diesel and crew are currently working on a final chapter for this trilogy. It surprised me to read that it's actually Vin diesel himself who came up with Riddick's universe. In an interview, Diesel says that he came up with the story for the whole trilogy when pitch black was released, just like, he states; Lucas'Star Wars.

CoR is designed to be entertaining not accurate.i am currently studying for a degree in film at university and i have to say this film may not be Pitch Black but as a sequel? damned good. the only time i can think of where a sequel is better than the original is Ace Ventura, so to be honest what did you expect? after watching the special effects i am slightly more impressed by the film as it shows you just how much of a sci-fi action can be made rather than using CGI.i was also fairly surprised that while looking at the mistakes made in the film the list was very short, now for a film on Ridik's scale the list should have gone on for days, this then made the film that much better in my eyes.However i cant help but feel that Ridik may soon go the same was as the dreaded pirates of the Caribbean. in this i mean that like the PotC Pitch Black needed no sequel as all the loosed ends were tied up. as with PotC the sequel was less focused on the story and more on the CGI. so although i love Ridik and want a new one to complete the story, i fear what the ""Hollywood"" producers will do with a third.",The Chronicles of Riddick

470,miraitrunks766,An in-depth look at Chronicles vs. Pitch Black,9,9 April 2007,"If anyone cares to read the numerous articles relating to interviews surrounding the release of The Chronicles of Riddick, or later interviews with the director, David Twohy, or Vin Diesel, they will learn that Pitch Black and The Chronicles of Riddick are two separate movies; Pitch Black is the prequel to the Chronicles of Riddick which is planned as a trilogy - ie: Pitch Black is like what The Hobbit is to the Lord of the Rings Trilogy. Thus, the two movies are related to each other, but to a point: in essence, Pitch Black is designed to set up a basis for a world in which Riddick and the other characters can exist and make it plausible.The Chronicles of Riddick sets up a new adventure, and a new story for us to watch, subsequently ridding itself of links to Pitch Black with the early death of Imam, and later, Jack (now Kyra) and giving us something to look forward to in the future.Riddick's character stays true to his original intent - he is very much a loner, annoyed at being pursued by Mercs and kills without hesitation whenever his life is threatened. One must remember this is what makes Riddick the mass-murder he is - it's necessity. He still has the same diminished view of life in general as he had previously, voicing that the universe ""had to end sometime"", though will help other people if it benefits him or does not hinder him in anyway. Subsequently, he also maintains the same sense of grudging honour he had previously. His personality grows also, within this movie. Where in Pitch Black, he seems to have considered Imam and Jack as ""survivors"", he now seems to consider them ""friends"", the only ones he seems to have had in his life. This is referenced when he (Riddick) states he ""showed trust"" in Imam, by telling him where he would be hiding out after their escape from the planet in Pitch Black, and later, when confronting Lord Marshal, ""You've killed everything I know"".The lingo of this movie, also stays true to the initial story, however the backdrop now expands to an entire galaxy, just as the story of Riddick begins to expand, giving endless possibilities as to what will come next. Personally, I think that the fact the story is not limited to one planet and a few people who are picked off one by one is refreshing as it allows for the expansion of the story, more characters and more questions needing answers.Humanity itself takes on a darker side with the appearance of the Neromongers, whose religion considers humanity a mistake - who could actually blame them, particularly with their actions? Thus we learn that ""evil"" as society sees it can be present in many forms - what's the difference between the Lord Marshal and Riddick; they both kill people don't they? The answer? Lord Marshal is greedy and power hungry; Riddick kills to survive, and he's the one persecuted and hunted for it. Twisted! And yet, I find it strangely reminiscent of today's society, where politicians can get away with murder, whilst the common man doesn't have a chance in hell. Riddick himself stated to Johns in Pitch Black, when the latter suggesting killing someone to feed to the creatures, ""kept calling it murder when I did it"". It's sad when you realise that most people who have commented on Chronicles thus far simply got a headache when they were forced to think about this movie and decided ""duh, my brain hurts lots"".In my opinion the acting works for each and every character. Diesel is extremely believable as anti-hero Riddick; how many people can say that they could pull off being able to show concern - and later tears - for a moody, identity-confused, young woman, whilst at the same time being a seemingly emotionless, cold-blooded killer, who clearly has something troubling him under that cold stare? And Thandie Newton gives a limited, but nonetheless wonderful performance as Dame Vaako, a futuristic version of Shakespeare's Lady Macbeth; same with Karl Urban's portrayal of the loyal and troubled Necromonger solider, Vaako, who reluctantly agrees with his wife's plans for greatness. And Dame Judi Dench, admittedly, her time is brief, but nonetheless enticing as Aereon, the Elemental who teases Lord Marshal about his future and who is essentially the one makes us ponder, ""What makes a Furyan so exceptional?""Now don't get me wrong, I am not someone who studies films in-depth in order to find a good side out of what others have deemed ""Riddick-u-lous"" (and whoever first wrote that one obviously had to think really hard about that pun didn't they?) In fact, I'm an fanatic when it comes to action movies, and I know what I like - and I like this. It has suspense, questions, explosions, fights - everything a fanatic like me could want. Maybe these critics should rent Catwoman and see what a real bomb is before suggesting to others that it is not even worth renting, let alone seeing a sequel to. When one watches this movie, you should not link it back to Pitch Black, merely acknowledge that Pitch Black is where our knowledge of Riddick's character began. Other than a few comments at the beginning of the movie and the appearances of Imam and Jack (Kyra), this movie has little relation to it's prequel, which is how it is supposed to be. The purpose of Chronicles is to serve as a backdrop to establish Riddick's history and perhaps personality growth that can be subsequently explored in future films.Perhaps the only link to Pitch Black (other than Riddick's character) that is left at the end is the question you ask yourself when the film ends, ""What's going to happen next?"" And I for one, would like to found out when the time comes.",The Chronicles of Riddick
471,brooket518,I think you should add another Chronicles of Riddick,8,24 February 2007,"I liked this movie a lot! it had a lot of action and i love Vin Diesel! I like how they made it seem like Riddick has no weakness and he has that bad boy look. I liked the storyline of the movie and how it kept me on the edge the whole time! however i did not like how kyra died in the end, i think that kinda ruined it. especially since the whole time it seemed like he was trying to protect her and then in the end she died. Other than that it was great! I also love pitch black, that movie was awesome! This is why i think there should be another chronicles of riddick. If there were to be another one, in my opinion, I think kyra should be brought back some how, i personally think it would make it a whole lot better. I think she should come back because then it wouldn't seem like it was a waste for him putting his life in danger all the time just to protect her.",The Chronicles of Riddick
472,firmfdude@hotmail.com,Dark and gloomy like a good Sci-Fi movie should be!,10,17 June 2004,"Chronicles of Riddick is the sequel to the movie Pitch Black that came out about 3-5 years ago. Chronicles of Riddick does not have much to do with Pitch Black but there is a small link. Anyway, Chronicles of Riddick continues the adventures of ex-convict Richard B. Riddick still trying to get away from mercenaries who want to capture him at the same time trying to find his sister and save her. Ultimately, Riddick wants to have a peaceful life where no one will bother him. However, this goal that Riddick has goes astray when he tries to save the universe from a fanatical religious human race called the Necromongers. The Necromongers want to convert everyone into their dark religion and expand the new universe called the Underverse. If any human planet resists this assimilation, the world gets destroyed. Riddick comes to save the Helion system of planets from the Necromongers in which is friend the Iman is from(Iman was in the first movie Pitch Black. He was the religious individual). The story continues on with a dramatic ending that was dark and gloomy but at the same time had a sense of hope. It is up to the individual to determine if Riddick reached his goals. Overall this movie was EXCELLENT. It was dark and has a lot of ""gloom and doom"" to it. I love the special effects, the storyline, the characters, and cinematography Just like all good science fiction movies should be which is dark and gloomy with good special effects, Chronicles of Riddick has it all.It is a unique story and I hope they can come up with another sequel real soon.",The Chronicles of Riddick
473,Scimitarex,Sci-Fi at it's best.,10,11 June 2004,"I saw Pitch Black only about a year or two before Riddick hit theaters, and I must say that I was impressed by it. But how can one move from a survival/thriller/horror genre to action/adventure/epic without losing that charisma that made it so good?The answer is Riddick. David Twohy has once again captivated my imagination in one of the best Sci-Fi movies I've seen in quite a while. Now, I'm not going to go around saying ""I love it! You have to see it!"", I am instead going to tell you that I think you should see it before you judge it.Many critics have criticized it, but an equal amount have given it high praise. Who should you believe? I say you should see it before reading any of the reviews at all, that way you don't have a biased opinion before walking in to see it.It all boils down to whether you like Sci-Fi or not. Action people should be happy, plot people should be happy, but if you don't like Sci-Fi, then that's OK. No one's going to blame you for liking it, and no one will blame you if you don't.I have read several books on scriptwriting and screenplays because I've wanted to be a Sci-Fi screenwriter for a few years now. Because of this, whenever I watch a movie I look for things like set-ups, pay-offs, character evolution, plot, and the like. Riddick has all of these.The acting is great. Karl Urban and Thandie Newton did a great job as well as Vin Diesel himself. Judi Dench, while in a small role, had an ethereal grace about her that me believe she was an Elemental, and not just an actor portraying one. The Lord Marshall, actor Colm Feore, was great in his role as the Necromonger tyrant, and he played him very well. Keith David, once again playing Imam, fits perfectly into his new role, and the other characters all have their own stories unfolding around them in believable ways.I won't go into the plot, because I don't want to spoil anything. If you can, avoid all spoilers at all costs before seeing it. It will water the film down if you don't.With that, I'll say this. If you like good Sci-Fi, this is it. But if you like ""down to earth"" movies, look elsewhere, and don't criticize it because it's not your genre.All in all, I say again, see it before you judge it, and make up your own mind about it.My rating: 10/10",The Chronicles of Riddick
474,mandatar,The comments on this movie,10,30 August 2007,"The comments on this particular movie actually made me register an account on IMDb.I'd like to start by saying that I am absolutely thrilled by the extreme emotion displayed about this movie, regardless of their conclusion.I think most people watched this movie with a rather biased opinion, and obviously the more common visitors of IMDb jumped into the bandwagon together due to their ""Vin Diesel aversion"".I think the reason for the posts was not because the movie is bad, but because the movie is actually very good. I can imagine the horror for some people after the realization that something they marked as ""the worst of worst"" is actually entertaining and even interesting. The only resolution then is to avoid these emotions and try to spit negativism on the movie as often as possible, anything to avoid being reminded about the greatness of this movie.This movie brings to me what I want to see in a movie. Surely it is not filled with hours of dialog. If I want that however, I can grab a book and read that. In a movie I want to be entertained with a fine mixture of visual effects, story and emotion.This movie succeeds perfectly in entertaining me. You must be a fan of the genre to like it, but if you are it's absolutely worth it.",The Chronicles of Riddick
475,mika2007,surprisingly entertaining,8,6 September 2007,"I stumbled upon PB and TCOR on late-night TV about a few weeks ago. I have never heard of them before. Loved both and bought the DVDs. I do not care much for Vin Diesel but now I hate to admit that I have grown fond of Riddick and his dark and brutal world.My childhood was filled with Asimov, U. Le Guin, Lewis, Tolkien/ those marvelous Ridley Scott movies, Lucas trilogy...So as you can see I am partial to the sci-fi/fantasy genre. If you're not, and would prefer something more mainstream/popular, then I suggest that you skip this movie.If viewers can overcome their 'Vin-aversion' then they would discover that Riddick's character is intriguing(esp in PB). You are mysteriously drawn to this man who is capable of the greatest good and immense evil.I commend the writers for at least bravely TRYING to create a new world while most filmmakers now rely on a surefire formula for box-office success (movie adaptations, big stars etc).",The Chronicles of Riddick
476,TRACmz,recommended,9,8 September 2007,"I'm puzzled why this movie got more than its fair share of criticism. Rip-off? Clone? Really now. Aren't these accusations in..er..Hollywoodlandia (where people worship at the altar of remakes) hilarious and a bit absurd? It didn't help that the creators themselves fostered such attitude, labeling their movie as the ""Dark Star Wars."" By doing so they set themselves up for comparison--and failure. It allowed others to trivialize their work, which is a shame.It is very rare to hear of a concept that was truly original. Nearly all works of film, literature and science were influenced, one way or another, by that which preceded them.I say ignore the critics and appreciate this movie for what it is. It is not Star War's poor second cousin. It can stand alone, so let it.It's a pity that because of bad press this film didn't do well in 2004. It is as if Twohy's labor of love was strangled at birth thus we can never see it grow to its full potential.I for one secretly harbor the hope that the child survived... and perhaps one day, after the dust has settled, then the tale can finally be retold.",The Chronicles of Riddick

I had the please of watching it last night and I can honestly say I was so surprised how much I enjoyed this movie. It really delivers at all levels. I won't go into the details of the movie, but I loved the fact it assumes the audience has a brain as oppose to most Hollywood movies assuming the opposite. A great story is told using special effects and great action to support the story. This is a great role for Vin and he really kicks ass during his fight sequences. After watching this movie, I realized that the trailer and commercials don't do it justice.Enjoy this movie, definitely worth the big screen experience and lets hope the journey for Riddick continues in other movies.",The Chronicles of Riddick
478,matinier,Science-fiction/Fantasy at its best,10,9 August 2009,"I don't usually give out 10 for most movies, but this one got such a bad rep, for some reason, that I can't help but want to raise its profile a bit. And anyway, it's worth at least a solid 8, if not a 9.Since the first Star Wars trilogy (not the pathetic second installment, which was... well... no comment), it is virtually impossible for writers, producers and film directors to come up with a world and a vision that are believable, exciting and capable of rallying fans and still be taken seriously by the critics. Chronicles of Riddick delivers what it promises. Period. It introduces us to a whole new universe and vision and it does so while remaining believable and exciting. The writing is sharp (dark humour, moral dilemmas, politics, and great action), the acting is solid, it is well casted: Colm Feore has all the presence of Sheakespearian villain, the role of Riddick is perfect for Vin Diesel's style, Karl Urban and Thandie Newton are great as the nefarious Vaako couple, Dame Judi Dench, as the scheming Aereon, has a commanding presence and adds her usual class to the ensemble.The visuals are stunning, the music is perfectly dosed, and it is very well shot. Overall, this movie is great entertainment. Isn't this what movies are supposed to be?Moviegoers often complain that to enjoy the Star Trek or Star Wars universe, you need a solid understanding of the underlying mythology. Speaking Klingon helps. Not so in this movie. It is inclusive and can be enjoyed by teenagers and their grand-parents alike. It is a movie that can be seen for itself, without having to be regular sci-fi convention attendee.This is not a cookie cutter film. It doesn't portray the universe as a black and white place, demonstrating rather that life as we know it is lived in the gray spaces in between. If you're looking for a film that sticks to conventions, you will be disappointed. The good guy is not that great, the bad guy has a grand plan to elevate his people and the hero's potential allies all have their own agendas. As for the ending, it is one of the best and most open-ended I have ever had the pleasure of seeing. You will feel satisfied by it, not cheated, and you will think about this movie once it's over.This film is an inclusive epic and I will definitely go see a hypothetical sequel. If it's half as good as Chronicles of Riddick was, it will go a long way towards reconciling me with the genre, after the disastrous Jar Jar Binks fiasco.Kudos to writer-director David Twohy. He should be proud of his work on this one.",The Chronicles of Riddick

I wasn't expecting anything Earth-shattering or profound; just a good, fun film. I got that. I want to see another, or even several more. Anyone who knocks this movie either hates sci-fi or thinks he is some kind of big-brained artsy-fartsy turd who expects too much from everything. Sometimes a movie is just a movie, and ""Riddick"" is ultimately watchable.See it for yourself- don't listen to the nay-sayers. Critics rarely know a good movie anyway because they're too busy trying to prove how ""smart"" they are. Hah. Why compare any movie to any other? And how does any film watcher assume they know what's good for other people? I hate to see anyone tell others NOT to watch a film. Especially this one! I just wonder if poor Vin made some Hollyturd big-shot whiny by producing this himself. That's the ONLY reason i can imagine for why this awesome flick got so much bad press.

480,JizaEiyn,The low rating is bogus.,10,16 January 2008,"Pros:: I thought this movie was awesome. It's the reason why I started liking science fiction in the first place. The CGI/special effects, plot/storyline, cast/crew, audio, and Especially the script was amazing. You had, of course, science fiction, and action, fantasy, suspense, and adventure.Some people may say there's romance but I think that ruins it for the Riddick-style of the movie. There were also uniqueness in the antagonist/protagonist roles. The fight sequences were impressive, all premeditated on the part of the main characters and realistic. I loved the way they sort of added Macbeth and all those other stuff in it.And this movie is totally different from most science fiction's because it doesn't really have those plots with the main character trying to save the world but then switches to saving his girlfriend instead of the world or vice versa.Cons:: Personally, It should have been a TV series or at least split CoR into two movies so it's not so confusing. But if you watch PB, the animated version, and then this movie with commentaries, it can Really explain a lot.I also understand people are mad at all the flashiness and ""its all SFX/CGI stuff,"" and the ""no storyline, bad script."" But Hello! It's a science fiction and actually, with the whole DVD collection of all those Star Wars, Star Trek, Terminator, and I guess Back to the Future, this is refreshing. It has it's on world/universe, own rules, own classes(elementals), own technology.. etc. It's a science fiction. I'm repeating that for a reason. Yes, she's floating. Yes, he keeps.. not.. dying. Yes, the rock cools fast. Yes, it's a science fiction.One of the bad acting I saw was on Alexa Davalos' part. She sort of gave off the wrong impression of Jack/Kyra with Riddick's character on most people and the ""Better Killer"" and teacup lines and stuff could have been done a little better. And also, I'm kinda sad at the fact that the Riddick character has gone a little soft but he's had history with these people and its shown in PB so that's already explained.",The Chronicles of Riddick
481,monkeytail2001,Know your background.,8,8 September 2008,"First things first.Having read previous comments from both the negative and positive side of things I have to say I like this film. That said there are several points that the detractors have missed out on. This is not a sequel to Pitch Black. You heard me. Not a sequel. Pitch Black is the prequel to Chronicles of Riddick. There is a slight difference. The difference being that the main storyline starts with the Chronicles of Riddick. The next instalment is yet to be released. So stop going on about how this never really followed in the same vein as Pitch Black. Prequels rarely do. Next up. The Chronicles of Riddick: Dark Fury is the sequel to Pitch Black. Go get it.Now for the hard part. The review.Overall I have to agree and say the plot is all over the place but thats what makes it fun. Here come a Nazi/Borg cross of an empire, that isn't really an empire, looking to kill or convert. Led by a man who has seen the Underverse and it changed him. We are told by Judi Dench's character that it sometimes takes a different evil to combat evil. Hence the part where Riddick comes in. His old friendly preacher Imam has set a 1.5 mill bounty on his head. However it was not Imam that put the money in for it but the elemental. That might shut up those who moan that the preacher could never have made enough money for it on evidence from Pitch Black. Riddick is found by the bounty hunter from Dark Fury, Toombs, and promptly kicks a lot of tail and steals Toomb's ship. Riddick goes seeking Imam for revenge, looks for Jack when Necromongers come, escapes from another slam and then beats up the leader of the Necromongers to become their 5th lord marshal. A plot within the plot is the Lord Marshals second in command being led by his crotch into betraying the Lord Marshal by the Lord Marshals woman. Not that she'd keep him around once he did become Lord Marshal anyway. See its not that hard to follow if you concentrate. The acting is decent and I happen to like Vin Diesel as an actor except when he works with kids. really. When Vin works with kids its like Ice Cube trying to act outside of a barbershop. Not gonna happen. Riddick suits Vin so well that if the studios don't make the next 2 parts to the chronicles then he will raise the money himself. Still I say this is a good film you should see but don't expect a Pitch Black. This is a different Genre.",The Chronicles of Riddick

A part on the surface of Hot Planet is absolutely nonsense and should be skipped.Vin Diesel is the one, who shall attract most viewers to see this movie.

487,e-j-noad,"So much promise, so much of it waster",4,14 August 2010,"Following up a low-budget character-driven survival horror with a lavish, special-effects laden science fantasy extravaganza was never going to go well. In fact, the sequel reflects badly enough on the original to spoil it a little bit. Don't get me wrong, it's not a terrible film but it is very disappointing.The storyline is awful. You can't get around it in any way what-so-ever, it's simply a string of contrived situations with a little space travel to get between the various locations. Little of the original film's intelligence is displayed here and the different plot strands are so distant from each other that when they do come together the result doesn't hold together coherently. The editing, camera-work and lighting also don't help at all - the flashing and shaky camera style used make the film very hard to watch at times and it's obviously been heavily edited at times to tone the violence down and get it's age rating reduced. The characters are all very flimsy with clichéd dialogue and poor definition. Even Riddick is very inconsistent and lord only knows what possessed Dame Judi Dench to accept her outstandingly pointless role.There are enough good points that make watching this film bearable. The production value has resulted in some breathtaking sets and costumes, even though they aren't entirely appropriate at times. The special effects are very good and the choreography, while sometimes ruined at the hands of the cameraman and editor, is pretty good despite some patchiness. There are also just enough moments - a scene here, a line or two there - that impress or lift the proceedings out of the dross with a little comic relief that you can forgive many of the failings of this film. But with so much potential, I can't help but think how appalling wide of the mark this sequel has landed. It's not bad enough to avoid like the plague, but it's not good enough to give much a damn about after you've seen it once.It's not (quite) appalling, but it should certainly be used in film school - as a cautionary example of sad sequel phenomenon.",The Chronicles of Riddick

While this is understandably a disappointment to the fans of the first movie, the details and integrity of the original movie are well maintained in this addition to the mythology of Riddick's universe.Although the allusions to the ""Underverse"" could be gainsaid to be shallow or otherwise undeveloped, it is instead something that gets the job done without excessive explaining. Besides, it remains something a sequel may take advantage of.Overall, I'm pleased to see this movie on the silver-screen and I'll likely end up owning a copy once it hits DVD. I simply cannot let a movie whose principal character is an anti-hero go by undefended, as Vin Diesel does a great job and his praises are once again unsung. (He's had his share of bad choices for movies, but he was the reason Pitch Black was a hit -- and remains the reason why Riddick nails its mark as well.)",The Chronicles of Riddick
490,cryo_gen,This movie should go in the bottom #50.,1,25 August 2004,"Such a stupid movie doesn't worth wasting your time you rather go to see a play with retarded actors at some charity institution. First, the actors are terrible. Second, the plot is ... if not stupid then - to be kind - really silly. It's like you would take some clichés from various space-SF movies and merge them in a random order then try to give them a shape so the dialogues seem to fit. But who knows, maybe it will even go for a high rating since it is already at 6.0 from about 4k votes. The problem here is that the rating no more shows the quality of a movie but the popularity among (sometimes) less gifted watchers.My opinion : this movie should go in the bottom #50.",The Chronicles of Riddick
491,HisRoyalFreshness,Don't believe everything you read :-),10,23 June 2004,"Now that the hype of this movie is over, along with all the people who just to blast this movie from ever angle. You need to give this movie a second chance and go see it. It was a lot of fun and a good big screen movie, with awesome sound,music, and effects. The story line was very straight forward and easy to follow, which made the movie more enjoyable to watch. Vin Disel was perfect again as Riddick and the comeback of some characters from pitch black really added to the story.I loved pitch black, but you have to put Chronicles in a totally different category, but that doesn't make it a bad movie. It means we could have a trilogy with a wide range of movies to fit different tastes. Unlike say, Jurassic Park and Scream where it's just more of the same stuff. I think this movie will do better as a rental than it does at the box office but I still feel I got my money's worth, and I will be adding it to my DVD collection when it hit's the shelves.Go see this movie, and expect a third one in the next few years to tie up the three movies nicely.",The Chronicles of Riddick
492,SpectralIllusion,Not bad...not bad at all,7,11 June 2004,"When I first saw previews for 'The Chronicles of Riddick' so many months ago, I was worried. When the preview first started, my first reaction was ""Oh god...a space version of Lord of The Rings- as if those movies weren't bad enough."" Then...I saw Riddick, and I didn't know what to think. I just couldn't imagine such a huge transition from horror movie monster slayer to adventure movie army destroyer. I half expected the movie to be nothing more than two hours of bland, mind-numbing garbage. However, I left the theater pleasantly surprised.*Spoilers from here on out*Vin Diesel reprises his role as the epitome of good and evil- Richard B. Riddick. I have no idea why people are saying that Riddick is no longer the bad ass he was in Pitch Black- he has the same attitude (as shown in the escape from Crematoria). We do get a glimpse of Riddick's softer side towards the end of the film as a rather unexpected event takes place. Alexa Davalos picks up where Rhiana Griffith left off as Jack, or as she is known now- Kyra. We first meet up with Kyra on Crematoria...where she is trying to follow in Riddick's footsteps and get an eye job. I was surprised to see that Jack had gone from helpless teenager to butt-kicking woman. Aside from Vin and Riddick, the light here also shines on Colm Feore, who has taken on the role of 'Lord Marshal', the leader of the fearsome 'Necromongers'. He delivers his lines to the best of his abilities, and brings his character to life...much like he did in 'Storm of the Century'. Now, on to the special effects, which I must say, are awesome. Perhaps one of the greatest scenes in the movie is the arrival of the Necromongers on Helion Prime. Seeing the giant ships descend onto the planet's surface as a battle rages on is breathtaking. The production crew certainly wasted no money when it came to the special effects and believe me, it shows. All in all, 'The Chronicles of Riddick' turned out to be a good movie. I wouldn't call it the best movie ever made, but I will call it a good movie. If you loved Pitch Black, you might like this movie. If you've never seen Pitch Black, you might still like this movie. Not having seen the first movie does not leave you in the dark when it comes to this movie as all is explained at one point or another. My Grade: B+",The Chronicles of Riddick

There were plot twists to make it more interesting. What I didn't like about the first movie was that I couldn't buy into them having regular guns and shotguns in a society that seems to be well advanced scientifically. These movie had some more advanced weapons and even the bullet firing ones were at least more futuristic looking. The fight scenes were well choreographed and Vin has the talent to do them well.

Everything about it the look, feel, and overall story setup was such a rip off of Dune. As for Kira and her rip off of Ripley from the Alien series, all I have to say is WHAT!? Crematoria is obviously an LV426 from Aliens or possibly Fiorina 161 from Alien 3.

498,asunja,loved it-but could have been better,9,4 September 2004,"I am a big Sci-Fi fan and a bid Vin Diesel fan. Pitch Black made me a Vin fan. So I was very much looking forward to this movie. I did see it three times and I am already waiting for the Director's cut DVD. But I have to say, the story has so much more potential. I wanted to learn more about the invaders and the Underverse. Let us understand more, why the underverse is so important. Let us understand their lives better and their obsession. Also a few shots of the Elementals, their planet and society would have been great. And some back flashed of Furia would have been needed. Those parts would have made the story more intricate. And cut a lot of the Crematory part out, way too long. I believe a better story would have brought not just Vin fans but a lot of Sci-Fi fans. Those fans want better stories, not just plain action.",The Chronicles of Riddick
499,vargavision,Chronical Of Riddick,10,5 January 2006,"I like the movie in part because of the snappy dialog between the characters Riddick and Tombs. It looked like Vin Diesel and Nick Chinlund had a great time interacting with each other and had good chemistry (not to mention both actors come from New York-that's just my selfish New York pride talking LOL!). The crusading Necromongers was a nice addition to The Riddick Series. It's Ironic how Riddick was fighting against the very same group who carried the same philosophy Riddick carried throughout his life; ""You keep what you kill"". For them death was the only absolute as a meaning of life and in many was, Riddicks self-exile from the universe was a kind of ""death"" in itself. The Air Elemental played by Dame Judie Dench (wonderful actress) was that one constant in the universe that was instrumental in bringing the balance back by having two opposites fight each other and how tragic Riddick was trying to save the people that he trusted, only to be killed themselves.Otherwise a movie with good entertainment with great actors and wish to see what the next in the series will bring.",The Chronicles of Riddick
500,gtufte_68,Pleasant Little Sci-Fi Surprise (Slight Spoiler),10,12 June 2004,"While in the theatre's watching the latest in big-budget action flicks (2 Days from Now) one of my friends got a glimpse of a movie coming out in the next couple weeks: The Chronicles of Riddick. He immediately wanted to see it, him being strangely helpless to the allure of action flicks, science fiction, and Vin Diesel movies. You can imagine his elation. Now, I had heard bits about it, and though a sci-fi fan myself, it didn't seem too interesting to me at first. I had never been a big Vin Diesel fan, though I didn't really have a problem with him either. He didn't strike me as anything special when I saw that one little piece of Pitch Black or Fast and Furious, but, oddly enough, it seemed more interesting after my friend had expressed his excitement for the movie. I, like many stuck-up movie know-it-alls, tried my best to disregard his comments as, what I thought, Diesel-ania.Before we saw the movie, however, we had to watch the original Riddick movie, Pitch Black. I borrowed a tape of Pitch Black from my brother who happened to have recorded it on the night he ordered it on pay-per-view. My friend, having never seen or even having any previous knowledge of the existence of a Vin Diesel sci-fi movie, was ecstatic. As I watched the entire movie for the first time, I began to gain a certain respect for it and for Diesel. Sure, his name may sound a bit silly, but names don't mean sh*t when you're confronted with a badass the likes of him. Combine this with the TV spots of the movie showing a glowing tagline that read something like ""the best science fiction movie in years"" and I was, needless to say, tinged with anticipation for the Chronicles of Riddick.Last night, opening night, me and six friends went to the movie. I cannot say I was disappointed. There were points that I actually said, ""Holy sh*t, this is actually some very good directing."" But then again, some of the fight scenes could have been better, as they can in every movie. Less quick edits PLZ! I say that it could very well have lasted much, much longer. A little bit more character development during the beginning to middle of the movie would have helped A LOT. Even without it, the movie stands as a very good, if slightly cheeky, science fiction film. As an action movie, it beats the hell out of most all recent competition. And as a Vin Diesel movie, it is the best.It's amazing what a little peer-pressure can do... :)G. ""His Mav-ness"" T.",The Chronicles of Riddick
501,abbottarts,"Resurrection and redemption theme makes this sc-fi intriguing. Careful, ""SPOILER"" at the end.",8,5 July 2004,"The special effects, the dialog, the action sequences, the plot pacing and even the subplot development all ranged from satisfactory to, at times, excellent. So where did this sequel go so terribly wrong?The character 'Riddick' is premised on the origin story of resurrection and redemption. I will use the 'Osiris' story as a model but there are others.Osiris goes something like this (I'm sure you'll correct me if I'm wrong). Osiris is the king of all Egypt. He oversees the major regions of Egypt. He becomes a God to his people. He is married to 'Isis'. Osiris' brother Set (or Seth?), invites Osiris to his home and kills him. Isis is back home and begins to wonder what happened to her husband. She goes to Set and finds out her husband is dead. She asks for the body back. THIS NEXT IS NOT CORRECT BUT IT GIVES THE IDEA. Set has had the body hacked into fourteen pieces. She takes the pieces back home and wraps them in linen strips (hence the origin of mummification) and copulates with the body. She conceives of her dead husband, a child. The child is born in the form of a falcon. Falcons were considered to be the messengers of God to the ancient Egyptians. The falcon child is named 'Horus'. Horus is the resurrection of Osiris. Horus goes on to kill Osiris' brother Set and is Osiris' redemption, through a vengeful act.OK how does this relate to TCOR? Well, Riddick is the common man's Osiris. He needs a resurrection and he needs a redemption. In PB, he is redeemed, by finding the humanity within himself to go back with Carolyn and save the others. Riddick is resurrected by Carolyn when she raises him on his feet (literal) and gives her life for him (metaphoric). This character development tied to an origin story is what made us love Riddick in the first film.SPOILER ALERTSo what went wrong with TCOR? Well, where is the resurrection? Where is the redemption? Good screenwriter's know that each act of a screenplay is a complete mini-movie within itself so if you are going to have three movies based on the same premise then the first movie represents the first act and should contain the elements of a complete movie. OK, maybe Riddick is resurrected from isolation after five years. I'll give them that, but there is no redemption. If they had bothered to put one last line in the film, fans would have left the theater waiting with baited breath for the next film. All Riddick had to say, was, 'How am I going to find you now, Jack'? With this, the audience would have realized that the faux Jack/Kyra was not really Jack and that Kyra was probably a merc plant to keep track of Riddick. It would have made a great cliffhanger, and it would redeem Twohy in the eyes of the fans (he needs to bring back the original Jack, Rhiana Griffith). With this line the redemption factor of the story would have been fulfilled because Riddick would still have the opportunity to save Jack who is really an extension of the Carolyn role from the first film. This line would have left open the possibility of Riddick literally going into the heart of hell ""Underverse"" to find the now dead Kyra to find out where the real Jack is. Can you imagine the special effects possibilities with that?Why did I bother to tell you about Osiris? Well, Osiris became king of the Underworld, an alternate universe of sorts, for the ancient Egyptians. Hmmh, Underworld/Underverse?This still has the makings of a good series. Twohy just needs to respect the fans and the basic rules of good story telling. You don't mess with the basic elements of an origin story. Love you David.",The Chronicles of Riddick
502,antekts-1,The best damn action/sci-fi movie I've seen in a long time,10,12 June 2004,"You people can disagree with me all you want, but as much as you may disagree with me I disagree with you. First of all, what was wrong with the story and the plot? It did exactly what it should've done as a sequel to Pitch Black, it included all the characters who survived and therefore connected to Pitch Black. The plot wasn't loosely strung together and while it may not have been the most complex, it did its job. Not all moviegoers are very intelligent as far as movies go because their minds are set on something else and they go to the movies for entertainment not for a complex plot or script. It's not intended to be ""The Lord of the Rings"" meets ""Star Wars."" But yet, because it takes place in the future and has ""cool-sounding names"" it's like Star Wars. I don't know where the hell you got the idea of ""The Lord of the Rings,"" it was nothing like that movie. As an action movie and a sequel it did it's job, to get fans to see Pitch Black and keep an eye out for the sequel to this. They want people to see it and enjoy it. Possibly in the sequel it will have this ""intelligent"" script you all speak of (which an action movie is not necessarily supposed to have). And Vin's acting is not horrible, nor the worst acting out there, what are you upset because he is ""Diesel"" and you're not? There's not room for much acting in the role nor the script. He's supposed to be a cold-hearted killer and I think he did his job at that. Do you want a Charles Manson who slices and dices his victims and cries about how it's because he was abused as a child? Do you want a killer who cries, is that what a killer is to you? I don't know what the hell you people expect in a movie like this? He fights people and he keeps some ass. How the hell were there as many ""clichés"" as you speak of? Maybe one or two but it wasn't like it was a movie based on clichés. Why don't you re-write the script for this movie and post it on here if you're so brilliant. I hate the people who expect something along the lines of ""The Lord of the Rings"" in a movie like this. When you have a stone-cold killer in a movie, the guy isn't going to look like Forrest Gump on a glorious summer day saying ""Mama always said life was like a box chocolate. You never know what you're gonna get."" I want you to think about that next time you see a movie like this and say that the script wasn't intelligent and the acting was horrible. Be happy for what it was and for the fact that the CGI wasn't overdone like most movies these days.Final word, bad ass action flick that you definitely must see and check out Pitch Black if you haven't already.5/5 (one of the better action flicks I have seen in recent years)",The Chronicles of Riddick

It is a good flick. The story isn't as deep as other movies but if you are looking for a movie to just enjoy this is a good choice. If you enjoyed Pitch Black you will probably enjoy this movie.

I would like to see a sequel, but not such a huge special effects bonanza as this one.I think the appeal to Pitch Black was the relatively complex character arcs and the emotional intensity that was amplified by the claustrophobic feel of the whole thing. The first movie was small and intense. This movie felt in some ways too big (and too jiggly in the camera work). It was at it's best in tight quarters like when Riddick was in the Iman's home interacting with his family and the elemental or some of the prison sequences. Now, if it had been made smaller (Oooh it would be hard to give up the invasion sequences though) it would have made a profit and there would be more on the way.I think Mr. Twohy displays certain consistent traits in his approach. I feel he tends to mistime the character arcs (Johns should have died later in the first movie to better pair his and Riddick's character arcs and the Necromancers should have been introduced earlier in this one so it didn't feel so much like two movies mooshed together). He tends to get an amazing start but then to really sing needs the collaboration of those around him (like in the first movie when Keith David as the the Imam ad libs ""There is my God Mr. Riddick"" and Diesel's insistence they film him on the ground after Fry is taken). I wonder if there was too much collaboration or in a big production like this was there the opportunity for less? Lisa",The Chronicles of Riddick
505,salkkus-1,My take on The Chronicles...,7,17 July 2004,"I have never liked Vin Diesel, but have a new found respect for him since watching Pitch Black, which in my opinion is one of the best sci-fi /horror movies out there. Diesel was flawless in Pitch Black and his character Riddick will forever be remembered by the movies fans. The one reason, the only reason I watched this movie -------> Riddick. And to my disappointment he was not half the ""badass"" he was in Pitch Black :)The plot is standard stuff with big explosions, memorable location and mediocre special effects. Despite the movies promising beginning, its all down hill afterwords.I wonder why Jack / kyra was not played by the original actor ( too young? ) But it's worth watching and I surely would be glad to see more of him :FI give it a 7 out of 10",The Chronicles of Riddick
506,jlpatton6171,Awesome!,9,12 June 2004,"This movie moves forward from where PB left off! and it does it beautifully! It makes things missing from the first make sense and broadens our horizons for what will hopefully be a trilogy or on going occurrence for the future.Reading the other reviews from above I do agree that the acting at times was uneven, but Vin Diesel and Dame Judy Dench are amazing. Vin doesn't try to recreate his character, but shows the the many layers that you supposed were there in Pitch Black. Judy Dench as with everything that she plays in proves why she is the actor that others try to duplicate but never imitate. She provides balance to the movie and craddles the mystery of the World she helped to draw us into. Throughout the movie she has that Mona Lisa smile that lets you know that she is holding information that she will not share, but will show us the way. I just can't explain adequately how much I enjoyed this movie. Its full of special effects and stunts that will blow your mind and keep drawing you back into story.

Now, it's probably my fault for expecting it to be as good as Pitch Black, but i did not expect to see another film that focused more on CGI than the actual story. I will admit that this movie has awesome actions sequences, and some fair acting by my man Vin, but it did not stand up to Pitch Black. I simply couldn't swallow the fact that a Furion was a member of the necromancers without the Lord Marshall knowing! Speaking of which, if you're the leader of a gigantic army you have to have a certain presence about you, or at the very least, you have to look scary. The guy playing the Lord Marshall had no presence, and he definitely did not strike any fear in me. All in all, I don't think any of the writers or directors of his previous films have taken full advantage of Vin Diesel's potential as an actor.

Pitch Black was about a dozen people stranded on a planet, trying to escape from the unfriendly locals. TCOR is about a tremendous galactic crusade and the part of the last Furyan in those events.

I was not to watch this movie because the advertisement was not that much attracted and the CGI effects seems annoying. But after this movie I would say this movie deserves better promotion. Vin Dissel, as Riddick, in this movie does not have a sense of justice, a stereotype little bit like Bruce Willis in the Die Hard series. Riddick wasn't to saving the world by himself, he did all these only for himself and his girl friend to survive. Humor in this movie seems to be all black, you don't even see Riddick smiles in this movie, not much humanity you could tell from Riddick because he is even not a normal human being in the earth. But still not evil to evil as saying in this movie, Riddick doesn't acting political way but only by nature. I would rather say he a decadent muscle machine with CGI supporting fight action, a new kind of hero stereotype that's worth waiting to be more complicated.

I had read a couple of the reviews beforehand, about how bad the movie was supposed to be. DON'T BELIEVE WHAT YOU READ FROM PEOPLE WHO HAVE NO IMAGINATION. IMHO, most film critics are wannabe actors who realize they have little or no talent and criticize every other actor who dares to have an idea and give that idea life. I loved this movie. I loved Pitch Black. These movies are VERY different in tone and scope but each works on the level it was intended to work. What I have failed to note in EVERY review was that the central point was missed: at the beginning of PB, Riddick had no humanity. During the course of PB.... he found what he had lost or maybe never had. In Chronicles... he comes full circle and at the end, is left with the question of what to do next? That fact seems to have been lost on film critics. The special effects are fabulous and the stunts.. breathtaking. As for the acting? Anytime you do a scifi film, you have to balance between the actors and the CGI. If you watch the actors' faces closely, especially Vin Diesel's face, you'll see a lot that isn't put into words. If you go expecting MacBeth, you'll be disappointed... but if you go wanting to know what happened to Riddick, and be given some tantalizing ideas of what can be done for PB3, GO AND SEE THIS MOVIE. I don't blame Vin and David Twohy for wanting to do it. If I were an actor... I'd want to do this movie too.",The Chronicles of Riddick
512,sillwillaj,"A good follow up to ""Pitch Black""",8,12 June 2004,"Riddick is by far one of the best anti-heroes to come about in recent cinema history! Diesel knows the character--as Eastwood knows Dirty Harry, Schwarzenegger knows the Terminator, Russell knows Snake Plisken. It's imperative to see Pitch Black before seeing The Chronicles of Riddick to get an understanding of the Riddick character first. I enjoyed the former very much mainly because of the sub-texts, themes, and character arcs of the main characters. Riddick (and the movie Pitch Black itself) are very layered and is not simply a sci-fi action/horror character. The sequel is a very good follow up for the Riddick character, in which he's becoming more like an interstellar Conan. He grows and envelops some, yet still retains much of who he truly is--a tough, independent, loner with a conscience (whether he likes it or not).Riddick is also the best character Diesel's ever played, and I hope we haven't seen the last of him. As I see it, both movies are about Riddick's life, rather than the particular story or plot being told.",The Chronicles of Riddick

This is one of those times. No, no one is going to win an Oscar for their performance in this film. But they're not bad either. Come on, in 1977 Star Wars didn't have Oscar-caliber performances either, and now it's considered a sci-fi classic. In my opinion, Vin Diesel plays Riddick just the way he should be played, a vicious killer trying to hide his emotions. This is a great action movie! Lots of fights, explosions, gunfire! Before I saw this film, I waited outside of the theater where it was showing, and listened to the comments of those coming out of the 7:00 show. Over and over again I heard ""Whoa!"", ""That was AWESOME!"", ""I LOVED it when he did..."" type comments from them. That's what I'm talking about. This is a GREAT popcorn movie! It doesn't try to change the world, doesn't deliver some all-important message, it's just a great shoot-em-up film. If you haven't seen Pitch Black I definitely recommend it before you see this film. Oh and remember, this film is really meant to be the first act in a trilogy....And Director David Twohy does a fine job of setting things up for acts two and three, and doesn't take 3 1/2 hours to do so....If you want to see a great action movie with great effects, see THE CHRONICLES OF RIDDICK!",The Chronicles of Riddick
514,rabidfox,It's about being entertained!,8,12 June 2004,"I don't go to movies just to see deeply rich acting, or completely original stories. I go to movies to be entertained. I understand that acting and plot are big factors, but when I walk out of a film, I judge how good the movie is, based on how entertained I was. Is Vin Diesel the best actor out in Hollywood today? Probably not, but...I -like- his movies. I have a good time when I watch them. That's what it's all about. I think above all the criticism about different components of the film, you should ask yourself if you were entertained by the movie.I gave CoR an 8. There were a few things I wanted to see more of (the planetary invasion in particular), but that didn't stop me from enjoying it immensely. I left the theatre wanting to see more, which is always a good sign.",The Chronicles of Riddick
515,Kayne314,Conan the Barbarian meets DUNE,10,13 June 2004,"By far the most enjoyable night I have spent at the Theatre in a long time.Okay, I admit it. The Academy will probably skip this movie. It's certainly not high art. This is just a fun, balls to the wall, flat out adventure movie. The movie was well written, even though it borrows it's themes from Conan the Barbarian, Dune, The Fifth Element, and MacBeth. It seemed to merge the concept of fun action with an in depth history of the universe it created.I didn't mind the campy aspects of the story, like a Prison Planet named Crematoria, or the badly named Necromongers. People will criticize Judy Dench for acting opposite Vin Diesel, but somehow it worked. Her presence on screen is needed to balance the larger than life character they created in Riddick.No, this movie is not going to win awards for it's brilliance, but is certainly fun to watch. If you enjoy a good solid action movie, you'll enjoy this one. It doesn't try to be Lord of the Rings, It doesn't try to be A Beautiful Mind. But what it is, is spectacular fun and heart pounding action-adventure.A 10 out of 10 on my scale.",The Chronicles of Riddick
516,gentili-1,Good clean sci-fi fun.,10,13 June 2004,"This was good world building sci-fi. I was intrigued by the weird types (lensers, elementals, etc...), mystical technology, and the big universe feel that the sets evoked. The characters were fun and their interactions witty without being a string of tired one liners. I especially liked the Macbethian relationship between the marshal's number one man and his power hungry wife. That relationship and the way it was worked into the final climactic scene added depth, believability, and a sense of satisfaction to the movie's resolution which is often missing from modern action flicks.My only qualm was the ubiquitous shaky camera which seems to plague fight scenes in a lot of action movies these days.Looking forward to the next installment.",The Chronicles of Riddick
517,tekkalord,Entertaining to watch despite its weaknesses,10,14 June 2004,"I must say that I enjoyed watching this movie, despite some of its problems. I went expecting a Sci-Fi action flick and that's exactly what I got. As far as overall plot goes.... well it could have been developed more. You never really get enough of a background on the Necromongers. The story explains why the Lord Marshal is waging the war (it's a personal reason), but not much else on the Necros besides that. Like why they refer to other races as ""Breeders"" for one.I think greater development of the new universe this movie creates is greatly needed. There are mentions of other ""verses"" in the movie. I think this may mean other dimensions, but I can't really tell. There is a severe lack of background information that should have been provided. To top it all off the ending basically leaves you hanging with the question ""so what's next?"" It seems more like a setup for sequels that will hopefully have greater development, than a pure stand-alone film.All in all though, this was a good sci-fi action flick that needed more plot development. Go see it, but catch a matinee to avoid those higher nighttime prices.",The Chronicles of Riddick
518,catbegemot,Cool Riddick kicks major arse but looses his charisma,7,16 June 2004,"You can read the plot in movie description, so I won't waste my time on that. Basically the movie delivers exactly what it promised - action, special effects (scene with prison animals is my favorite) and ... nothing more. I mean - really. The whole movie is about Riddick being so tough no one comes near, just like good old Arnold S, but supposedly with brains: ""Because that's what I planned"". Somehow the charisma of Vin Diesel disappeared in the very first minutes of movie and never returned. All there is to it is extremely tough and fireproof Vin Diesel who kicks every bad ass he finds and survives where all other men fall. Pretty plain story. BUT! I must admit - I liked the movie for the action (I think they beat ""Commando"" in that sense) and special effects. That's why I paid my ten bucks for it and that's why I'll buy the DVD when it's going to cost $14.99 in a couple of years. If you like movies like ""Commando"", ""Die Hard"" and alike - you may want to give this one a go.",The Chronicles of Riddick
519,Johniece1976,It is a movie worth repeating.,10,18 July 2004,"TCOR is a refreshing sci-fi action/adventure movie and I believe, as many others do, that with better marketing strategies it could have brought in greater revenues in its domestic theatre release. I sincerely hope that Universal Studios takes into regard the poor marketing campaign that it executed when considering the decision to green light (or not)TCOR II and III. The studio should realize the poor release date resulted in having TCOR sandwiched between ""Harry Potter"", ""Shreck 2"", ""Garfield"", and ""Dodgeball."" Couple the release date with the marketing failures and TCOR should have barely broken into the million dollar figures. Yet, despite the poor execution, TCOR has managed to gross over $50 million domestically alone. And, yes, to all you sourpusses out there: that means while not perfect IT IS A GOOD MOVIE!Given the fact that I had seen a few trailers for TCOR and wasn't really impressed by them, I was taking a chance by seeing the movie (even being the huge fan of ""Pitch Black"" that I am.) I'm glad I took the chance. The trailers and promotional posters DID NOT do this movie justice, and I believe that if the trilogy is continued it has the potential to break into ""Star Wars"" territory. So, that being said, the fact that anyone saw this movie at all with the poor marketing and horrible release date is amazing.I know there were some folks who saw this film that had made up their minds to hate it. Most of these people are 'Diesel haters' who just cannot stand Vin Diesel so they have to criticize the man's acting and/or appearance. Some of course may even be huge fans of Deisel and the 'Pitch Black' film but are fuming because the character of Jack in TCOR is portrayed by Alexa Davalos instead of Rhiana Griffith. Boo-hoo. I loved Rhiana in 'Pitch Black.' She is an excellent actress and I really don't believe any other actress could have pulled off the character of Jack in that film as well as she did. However, I believe it was a wise decision to recast the Jack/Kyra character and Alexa Davalos does an amazing job. Even though Alexa is actually older than Rhiana, (so I've heard) she looks quite a bit younger than Rhiana presently does and since the character of Kyra is only supposed to be around 17 years but still very tough, recasting the role just makes sense. Additionally, there is supposed to be an element of sexual tension between the Jack/Kyra character and Riddick, and I don't think audiences would have seen it that well if they had cast Rhiana. This is just my opinion. Some have said they saw NO chemistry between the characters of Riddick and Kyra. I think they are wrong, but hey, free country.There were many facets of TCOR that I enjoyed. The set designs, the costumes, acting, and the chemistry between the characters as well as the imaginative storyline draws viewers into another world, allowing them to suspend disbelief. It is amazing how much director David Twohy was able deliver on this film as he only had a budget of a little over 100 million. Sure it's substantial money but it still remains a budget that is far below what most movies of this particular genre (not just science fiction but action/adventure) are being budgeted for today.I hope there are sequels, at least one more. My husband says TCOR played more like a foreign film. I don't know, my husband is a bit more of an artsy geek than me, but I hope TCOR does very well internationally. Three Cheers to all involved. My score was a10. Sure, I know it's not a perfect film, but heck, I've been starved for a great sci-fi story for so long it gets a perfect score.",The Chronicles of Riddick
520,max-381,good new sci-fi story,9,19 June 2004,"it's a good Action Sci-fi movie. Looking forward to the next Chronicles of Riddick because this movie starts a good story, the special effects are impressive and Vin makes a great Riddick.We are introduced to a new science-fiction universe and given just the right amount of insights to makes us want for more. Of course not everything is equal, some scenes are not credible, and some characters seems to have no on screen end. Hope we will learn more later. If not, it is minor.The rhythm of the movie is well balanced between action, drama and a bit of humor. They didn't fall in the ""love"" thing (like Neo and Trinity in Matrix). They avoided some clichés while have some others... like ""the chosen one will come to save us""...Before him there was Luke, Neo, and others, but they never were as dark as Riddick. And that is what makes this film interesting, it's dark side. You don't feel that ""all is well that ends well"" even if the good guys win...So I say its a good new Sci-Fi story",The Chronicles of Riddick

The fiction elements along with some elements of role-playing games and charming performance of star-action here Vin Diesel incorporated in a modern SF movie designed for specifically targeted group.

522,herberth-2,It seems to me that it's no so cool to like this movie...,10,21 June 2004,"Still I am a man who does not automatically like what is trendy and dislike that all which is not, and like Riddick, I dare to brake that unwritten rule which people impose on us. So I can without guilt say I like this movie.I have read a lot of reviews that are floating around on the web and most seem to be very negative. Many have come to the conclusion that the plot is very thin and the characters two dimensional. Well I without any doubt can declare that most people are fools. You see, a man who has read just a little more than the average amount of literature can instantly see that this movie us full of references from books that have been around for generations. For example Shakespeare's Macbeth, but I'm not going to explore all the details for that has already been done!Maybe that is the reason why so many find this storyline so uninteresting... they might just have read/heard/seen it before?! So to me it seems that is forbidden to make a movie that derives it plot from story's that have been used so many times before, just because it's a Sci-Fi. I never hear anyone complain when it's done by the other Hollywood mega-budget movies. TCoR is a good movie that is a sequel to a even better movie that was also shunned by critics and movie goers, I would not be surprised if it gets the same warm welcome when it arrives on DVD.I give Riddick 7.5/10 and by my standards... that is very good.",The Chronicles of Riddick
523,columcille-2,Very impressed,10,28 June 2004,"In a genre often characterized by excessive violence, language, and sexuality I was quite pleasantly surprised by this movie. While nothing like Pitch Black Chronicles of Riddick does carry over some things hinted at in Pitch Black. The storyline goes well beyond a generic horror/thriller type found in Pitch Black, with this movie weaving intricacies and subplots to draw a complete movie which works very well. Even in the realm of sci-fi the movie is weird, but only because it is quite unique. The weirdness is not excessive, it is creative and drew me in from the start. The way the plots are tied together holds the attention and the way the movie ends leaves you with a hesitating hope that all may just be well in the universe - maybe. It's a perfect ending for a science fiction, giving you answers while also leaving your imagination room to work.I rate this movie quite highly and recommend it to any fans of good, creative science fiction. This one is visually pleasing, intellectually pleasing, and just plain good.",The Chronicles of Riddick

It is fast paced, sci-fi action with some real cheesy one liners, but that is what we have all come to expect from Mr Diesel. C.g.i and stunt effects are really good. It is of course a typical action movie, no real emotion and lots of muscle flexing, and you don't have to use much in the way of brain cells to watch it, but i for one liked it a lot. The only real draw back is that if you have never seen Pitch Black, you won't really grasp a lot of the film e.g. ""Jack"". Which is a bit unfair. This is not the most intelligent of films but if you want to be entertained and see some decent sci-fi action then i would recommend this film.",The Chronicles of Riddick
525,bayouskye70,Not a sequel to Pitch Black,10,2 July 2004,"The Chronicles of Riddick isn't by any means Pitch Black 2. It was never marketed that way, so if you went to this movie expecting to see PB2, well, you will be disappointed. The previews and trailers all showed this to be an entirely different movie, Riddick was there. Imam was there, however briefly it may have been and Kyra (an older version of Jack) was there. But, none of them were the same characters from Pitch Black.Well, Imam was pretty much of the same mind as ""save thine own ass first"" as he was in the first movie, but that's about as far as the similarities go.The Riddick in Pitch Black was dark and mean and all about self preservation. The Riddick in Chronicles is what you get when he attempts to rejoin the human race. That's what everyone wanted, right... that's what everyone was hoping for, that'd he'd save Jack and Imam and take them to New Mecca and they'd live happily ever after...Now, seriously, if that was the way that the story turned out, then there'd be no need for a sequel or chronicles of anything. You could get all the ""happily ever-after"" you wanted by searching the web and reading the mass quantities of fan fiction that's been written about the cult classic.We all knew he would leave them, knew there was no way in hell that he could hang out in New Mecca, blend in with locals. And honestly, that's what we all wanted, we wanted him to leave, wanted Jack to go after him, wanted something bad to happen to her and wanted Riddick to have to come back and save the day, just like he did before.And, that's pretty much what he did, only in a much grander fashion. Gone are the gritty filters that showed us the world of Taurus 2, the poverty that seemed to wipe the universe clean of all but the barest of necessities. In its place, the thriving metropolis of New Mecca, a frozen waste land, a hell planet that either burns you to a crisp or freezes you into a popsicle within seconds of exposure, and an other worldly cult religious sect bent on taking over everyone and destroying everything in its path.Like I said, another movie entirely. Does this make it a bad movie? Only if you went in expecting to see Pitch Black 2. Otherwise, it was a good movie. It's fast paced, lots of fight scenes, a dark and dirty prison that seems impossible to escape. An evil bad guy that can reach inside you and rip out your soul and last but certainly not least, it's got Riddick.Well worth the cost of a ticket and a bag of popcorn.",The Chronicles of Riddick
526,neotoxicwebmail,Fun no brain'er,8,8 January 2005,"Its defiantly a no brain'er but like its predecessor 'Pitch Blank' its was surprisingly fun to watch.There was a fair bit of imagination and effort put into the look of the movie. Watching the evil 'Necromongers"" I can't help but be reminded of Dune, the 1984 David Lynch Movie based on the Frank Herbert book. The CGI was plentiful, but done well and you never get that feeling that you sometimes get with CGI that you are just watching cheep time filler. In fact the film keeps its fast action pace up competently for 2 hours, and I get the feeling that the could have easily added an extra hour of movie if they thought people would have sat through it and I have to say I probably would have done. In fact I understand that there is a Directors cut version of the movie with an extra 15 minutes.There were some rather strange casting choices for this movie. Dame Judi Dench plays Aereon, an ethereal being who acts as a kind of witch / oracle type character, seems out of place. Also in my opinion Colm Feore didn't seem to have the screen presence that was needed in his role as the lord of the Necromongers. However Vin Diesel seems to be as one dimensional as Riddick and so perfect for the role, or at least he and the character are now so intertwined its impossible to imagine someone else playing it. Alexa Davalos was in the difficult position of having to portray a young, sexy super hardcore ass-kicking babe, the grown up version of Jack/Jackie from 'Pitch Black'. This type of character never really works on screen as the total implausibility of it glares out at you. Vin Desal at lest looks like he could give you a tough time in a bar fight, but young attractive girls tend to look like they would just get squashed. However in all fairness Alexa dose a good job, and it pull of the physical aspect of the roll well. She dose however look impeccably well maintained for someone who supposedly has had such a rough life.The Chronicles or Ridddick is a fun movie, imagination and face paced action mixed with some good CGI and an ambitions story. If you like Science fiction, a genre that seems to be somewhat on a decline these days, then watch this movie, just don't think about it too much.",The Chronicles of Riddick
527,david_g-1,A good film that could have been great.,9,18 July 2004,"I had few expectations when I saw the first Pitch Black movie. From the previews I had seen it looked to be little more than a creature feature starring yet another muscle bound Hollywood action clone. However, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the film. Despite the B-grade performances from some of the Australian supporting actors, the interaction between Vin Diesel's Riddick, Radha Mitchell's Fry and Cole Hauser's Johns sparked the film and took the attention off the CGI effects. Pitch Black was not without flaws but it was enjoyable and left me wanting more.Fast forward to 2004 and The Chronicles of Riddick (COR). Riddick has been placed out front for this one and the film focuses more on the origins of the man that would become a animal and the fates of the survivors he saved at the end of the first film. Riddick as a character works best when he in conflict with those inimical to his survival (i.e. Johns in the first film), Twohy's decision to make him the reluctant hero in this film doesn't sit well and as a result Riddick looks decidedly uncomfortable in some of the scenes he shares with Imam (Keith David) and Aereon (Judy Dench).That said, COR does well to improve the backstory of Riddick and despite a few uneven set pieces (the biggest of which would be the end sequence involving the Lord Marshall, Riddick and Lord Vaako) demonstrated that Twohy has a real desire to create a living, breathing universe on par with that of Star Wars. COR possesses some interesting characters but the ones that should matter most are underdeveloped. Toombs (Nick Chinlund) for one proves to be good foil for Riddick - he is not as menacing as Johns was but he provides levity throughout the film and he gets most of the best lines. Judy Dench looks dignified as Aereon but she is underused during the film and looked more like expensive window dressing in some of the scenes she shares with Riddick and the Lord Marshall. The Lord Marshall (Colm Feore) himself was underdone. While his motivations for wiping out the known universe are explained during the opening sequences of the film you never get the feeling of the dread he is supposed to inspire. Kira (Alexa Davalos) makes for an interesting distraction and provides the link to humanity Riddick needs but she doesn't feel like Jack from the first film. Little time is spent on just how she came to be a in a triple max security prison when she meets Riddick later in the film.Faults left aside COR is a worthy follow up to Pitch Black and it advances the story threads Twohy began in the first film. A little uneven at times, COR is nonetheless entertaining. Hopefully Twohy gets the go ahead to make the next film in the proposed Riddick Trilogy. It would be interesting to explore his universe and learn more about the animal who would become a man.",The Chronicles of Riddick
528,holleloetsch,Space Opera?,7,3 September 2004,"Do I like the movie? Yes, I do. It gave me the feeling of the Space Opera books, I like so much. Of course a book is more detailed. The story and the hero of the movie are actually quite simple. Nevertheless it IS a real hero. If you expect a good action movie and a cool hero. Here you have it. BUT there are three things I hate in movies. Flashes, Close ups of fighting scenes and shaking hand camera. The director combined all three in his fighting scenes. I even had to close my eyes from the flashes. So why do I read over and over again of good fighting scenes in that movie? There was mostly nothing to see! Only the imagination can make these fighting scenes good. But actually I want a sequel, because I space opera continues. :)",The Chronicles of Riddick

Great face, great voice, great presence. I think he was a wonderful cast for the part of Vaako. Even when he wasn't speaking you could feel Karl projecting Vaako's ambition and inner turmoil. Props to Anne McCarthy, Mary Selway, and David Twohy on casting Karl for Vaako. Judi Dench is also another good cast. Despite my favoritism for any of Karl's characters, I was expecting Vaako to die in the end. I was actually hoping for it. The only point I see in leaving him alive is to create a sequel involving Vaako. To end on that note, should a sequel arise I would not hesitate to see.

531,jamal91788,The Chronicles of Riddick: 7/10,10,6 September 2004,"""The Chronicles of Riddick"", the sequel to the low-budget cult film ""Pitch Black"" is an epic adventure following the adventures of the character Riddick. Five years have passed and Riddick has seen hiding from Mercs on the outskirts of the Universe, until he is pitted in an intergalactic war between the Elemental race and the Necromongers, an unholy crusade killing or converting planets on their pilgrimage to their promised land, the UnderVerse. On his adventures, we learn that Riddick is actually the last of an alien race known as Furyans and he is the prophecised balance that will save the Universe. It is almost like Beowulf or The Odyssey where there is one central character struggling through mythological battles against various enemies, although Riddick is something new for good reasons and bad reasons.POSSIBLE SPOILERS:GOOD REASONS what makes it different from other films following one character is that Riddick is an anti-hero who does not want to be the redeemer of the Universe. All he wants is to be left alone and we can see that in the film. He is a serial killer, an almost cold-blooded murderer and now he is given the choice to save or ignore the fate of the Universe. This makes the film interesting to watch and the character of Riddick (played by Vin Diesel, an atrocious actor) is surprisingly electrifying when he is on-screen, not for his acting but simply for his presence. You feel good and excited when Riddick is on screen. Another positive thing about the film are the visuals, mainly the physical look of the Necromongers. Everything is so Gothic and baroque, architectures that illustrate struggle (and faces)-- this is the sort of science-fiction action epic that most people have been waiting for a long time, but the main reason why it has been the negative talk amongst critics and movie watchers is mainly that the lead actor is Vin Diesel. I don't blame them. He is a terrible actor, but weird to say, he is good as Riddick (not acting-wise, but simply ""being Riddick""-wise).BAD REASONS what makes the movie 7/10 is the script itself and director David Twohy. In scenes, the dialogue is terrible, almost unbearable. In one scene, Riddick actually says to Dame Vaako (played by Thandie Newton), ""It's been a long time since I smelled beautiful."" Just terrible. So stupid and almost laughable. In that scene, that could have made the movie 6/10 or even 5/10, but me (for being a hard critic) let that line slide. But what I didn't let slide and in a way ruins the movie is the fact that this is an epic and yet you don't feel like it is an epic. ""Chronicles of Riddick"" has the potential of being the next Star Wars or Lord of the Rings, but unfortunately it suffers David Twohy, a low-budget director who knows nothing about epic films. He wrote the dialogue as though it took place in the ghetto, but this is 500 years in the future and adding to that, this is in the Universe, intergalactic epic adventure. Lines go from ""They are an army that now seeps through the worlds of man, leaving behind a trail of dead planets and towering icons, monuments to their unholy crusade"" to ""Sister, they dunno what to do with just one of me."" I would prefer the intelligent dialogue instead of the slang and ghetto-talk from Riddick and the Mercs. Another failure which is actually not the failure of the movie itself but the failure of the theatrical version of the movie since most of the movie was cut down to make it PG-13 which took out most of the character development and all the violence and blood that would spice the movie up. I'm buying the Unrated Director's Cut and I am anticipating on the next two sequels coming up. Although I give this movie a 7/10, it is an enjoyable action flick and hopefully the next two movies will correct the mistakes of the first one. The movie needs to be more epic, more violent, better acting, better dialogue, and especially taken to the point of being more than just another mindless action flick. This movie has the potential of doing that and what it needs is a good script and better director.Thanks, David Twohy, you jackass!",The Chronicles of Riddick
532,reedabook,my comments do reveal a tiny bit of dialog,10,12 August 2004,"This is a great Sci-fi movie about the ever so timely subject of religious intolerance. If a person prefers not to think of the colonization of the Mid-East as religious intolerance then the Necromonger campaign is reminiscent of the Christian Crusades and Spanish Inquisition all rolled into one. Either way, brilliant social commentary masked as an entertaining movie.The role of Dame Vaako is the best part. Not only does she have the best clothes, she also has the best lines and her facial expressions are priceless. As soon as Riddick says, 'I bow to no man.' there is no mistaking the look Dame Vaako gives him. The most potent aphrodisiac for a woman is a man with tremendous inner strength. (Ok, his obvious physical strength doesn't exactly put a tamper on the sexual tension.)My only complaint, and it is a small one, is over two sentences of Kyra's dialog that are said as the group of prisoners plan to escape Crematoria. The two sentences instantly reminded me of the Seinfeld episode where they are casting for and filming the pilot for the sitcom 'Jerry,' and Elaine's character(s) keep practicing the line 'I know that look.' When Kyra says that line twice in a row I just cringe.I love the whole antihero storyline, as do every female friend I have even the ones who do not normally watch Sci-fi movies. We enjoy seeing a male protagonist struggle with his self-preserving instinct and his conscious.Finally, kudos to David Twohy for pulling off a tightly written action movie with no gratuitous violence and no unnecessary objectification of women. The violence is broken up so that there is no lingering over any gore, and all the women get to keep their clothes on. 'Flawless.'",The Chronicles of Riddick
533,michael_wray005,I'll see it again and buy it on DVD.,10,14 August 2004,"I encourage you to go see this movie. I was unsure what to expect at first and nearly wasn't going to see it. I didn't think too highly of pitch black... Granted I was drunk on half a goon bag at the time but it didn't really tickle my fancy... The only cool thing about Pitch Black was it introduced me to this character of Riddick a convict thats portrayed to be this big bad guy but he seems to always get caught up in helping other people combat a greater evil... Which I the drunken audience just love. So taking this premise Riddick is my hero... anyway... I went and saw the latest incarnation because Riddick is like a modern bushranger... and I'm Australian:P:P. I loved this movie ! Riddick ain't such a bad guy give him a try. The basic plot has a sense of ancient Rome Conquer and expand feel to it with the ""Necromongers, an army that plans to convert or kill all humans."" Riddick gets caught up on the next target planet for the Necromongers when he seeks to find whoever has the bounty on his criminal head. MWHAHAHA tis here where he meets one of the two survivors from pitch black and he is confronted with the choice of helping him against the Necromongers. He also learns about the whereabouts of the other survivor from pitch black and alas our criminal hero has himself some objectives. It makes for a great adventure, The action is good, The Story well written, The characters well portrayed you know riddick's a bad guy but ur always saluting the air and consuming a beer every time he makes a kill. Vin diesel is the legit Riddick. He makes that character all the more appealing. If someone like Brad Pitt were Riddick ....Riddick wouldn't be a hero he'd probably hurt his Achilles or be lacking of energy from a massive protein diet. The chronicles of sleeping...pfff what am I on about? Thinking of Brad Pitt made me start babbling. Vin diesel owns as Riddick.

I can say that this movie doesn't have a story, it's bad acting.It's only contains SFX, and nothing but SFX. When I saw it first time, I thought ""Oh my God, what the f*** is this?!"". It's only a lot of money thrown in the river.The only people who may watch it, is the fans of Vin Diesel. Another sad thing, is that he is the producer of the film. He has decided almost everything (I guess), about the ""story"". He's just tensing his muscles through the whole movie! He isn't an actor!I don't recommend this film to anyone.",The Chronicles of Riddick
535,kastanok1,Unorginal but none-the-less great,8,1 September 2004,"Sequel to the vastly under-appreciated sci-fi horrt, Pitch Black(2000), Riddick is a slick action movie with style.Vin Diesel (Pitch Black, xXx, The Fast and the Furious) reprises his role as the ultimate anti-hero, Riddick. A merciless, efficient killer, Riddick is always one step ahead of the mercenaries sent to kill him by any one of the five planets he's managed to annoy. Not that he goes out of his way to cause trouble. All Riddick really wants is to be left alone. Never-the-less, when his persuers get close, he can dispatch them without anyone even noticing, in total darkness. In the opening scene, with merc leader Toombs (Chinlund, Tears of the Sun, Hellboy) and his gang pursuing Riddick over miles of snow and ice in his ship, chases Riddick into a deep crevice in the ice. As he follows in, Riddick cuts the two gunners from their slings on each wing then dispatches the third gang member and leaves Toombs in the snow, taking his ship. Poetry.When the greater evil of the world-destroyer Necromongers threatens the world of Helion Prime, Elemental diplomat Aereon (Dench) knows the Riddick is perhaps the last man alive who can stop them. Necromongers are religious fanatics. What they cannot convert to their way, they destroy in a truly impressive manner.They have a strict, militaristic hierarchy and a strong code. Because of these rules, military command is a highly political role with plenty of opportunity for back-stabbing and promotion by dead-man's spiky boots. This is the way Lord Vaako (Urban) is manipulated into attempting to take the position of Lord Marshall (Colm Feore) by his incredible ambitious wife, Dame Vaaka (Newton).I can't tell more without giving the plot away (which is surprisingly detailed). Chronicles of Riddick, undoubtedly the first in a series, is classic sci-fi with a twist. It's magnificent aerial battles are reminiscent of the very best of Star Wars. Troop combat is on a par with Lord of the Rings and individual combat is only an inch of the wonderful real world fight scene from Matrix: Revolutions.Riddick is an incredibly visual movie. At times, it's almost pitch black (pardon the pun) and at others the audience is blinded by the rising sun. Also, the style and quality in the Necromonger's entire civilization and the dazzling, fearful beauty of the dawn on Crematoria... it's amazing work by the design and graphics teams. However, some is just comic such as a plunger-mechanism to destroy a world and the 'Lensers', Necromongers with coloured glass plates that allow them, and others, to see in infra-red etc. They just look... silly. The prison hell-hounds are unoriginal. Entertaining, but nothing new. The final battle really was a shame, though. It was unimaginative, clichéd and the outcome so, so... inevitable.Apart from that, Riddick is a great and entertaining film. Go and see it. Now.Best bit? In the prison on Crematoria, Riddick kills a man with a tea cup. He did warn him, after all.Score: 8 / 10",The Chronicles of Riddick

The character of Riddick is supposed to show a primal being, and Diesel is perfect for that. He makes the smallest whisper of a touch seem so sensual it makes even an old mom like me melt. The movies themselves are definitely attention getters, otherwise not so many people would have anticipated seeing Riddick Chronicles and voted for it here on IMDb!

It's true that the movie was quite different than the tone of Pitch Black.. But as much as I loved Pitch Black, I love this movie more. There is depth to each character that Pitch Black didn't quite have, and there's more purpose behind it. Pitch was good for introducing Riddick, but Chronicles is so much more complicated. I also found myself liking Riddick a lot more, he's certainly not less ""badass-but-not-quite-evil"" than he was in Pitch Black, but he's not insane either, so it makes perfect sense as to why he'd give a crap about avenging the death of the priest and trying to save Kyra. Having all the mythology surrounding him makes everything a lot more interesting as well.",The Chronicles of Riddick

This Movie, though a stretch from pitch black has started a whole new world of characters and left it wide open for a sequel. What will a person with Riddicks character do with all that power? You just have to love an anti-hero. I loved the whole theory of religious conversion, how it parallels the reality of today and especially the past. The Christian crusade was not much different. This movie had a great atmosphere although the effects were a little too digital. All and all I believe we will see a sequel.

Got no clue what happened here.Vin Diesel as usual was flawless. Great direction by David Twohy.Through the Movie, I expected there must or should be a flaw in the Movie that made it even below 7. And then, when not much much of the Movie was remaining, I knew there will be a bad ending and that whatever amazing platform was setup, will be ultimately ruined by some poor, improper or meaningless ending. Fortunately, I was WRONG!Well, to sum up, its pretty enjoyable (even if you are not much of Action-Scifi-Adventure type).Wish I could have written a little about this movie, but that would spoil your utter enjoyment.

This film is one of the worst film i have ever seen, after just about 10 minutes i realized that this was a terrible movie, and i totally hated it. its not worth the money paid renting it! I think that the history was kinda thin, and the acting very bad, and not even the easy job to know whats going to happened. this is a real bad movie, with no depth what so ever, and i strongly recommend NOT seeing it. use you money on something else.",The Chronicles of Riddick
542,danielparsley,Accedential discovery of a good character improves with directors cut.,9,17 December 2004,"It is clear from the theatrical version of pitch black that the director did not recognize what he had in his hands with Vin Diesel playing Riddick. Its good enough that the cult following that sprung up around pitch black was vocal about what they liked because without that chronicles would never have been made and Pitch Black would have faded into the unknown. Both films were good but the original was good for an entirely different set of reasons then the second was. Either one is a good watch, and the two are not dependant on each other. I think that the directors cut of pitch black is the directors attempt to show he intended for riddick to be as popular as he is, when that is not the case.",The Chronicles of Riddick

Unfortunately I missed seeing it in theaters (partly due to the critics' lukewarm reviews, partly because I'm not a huge fan of Pitch Black), and yet it might have been a blessing in disguise.When it came out on DVD I rented the Director's Cut. This movie is the proverbial ""sleeper"", and amazes me that it didn't do as well in theaters or among the critics. Comments from another viewer, who saw both the theatrical release and the Director's Cut, blasted the producers for editing the 20 minutes of additional footage (ie: Furyan dream sequence and establishing the relationship to the Purifier). I have no intentions of renting the theatrical, however, COR made such a positive impact on me that I rented PB and Dark Fury just to fill my curiosity of the anti-hero Riddick.Finally, I broke down and bought the DVD; I was hesitant because of some strong language (a couple of F-bombs) and I have small children. I loaned my copy to my younger brother and he gave it rave reviews also. Bottom-line: if you want to add value to your Sci-Fi collection, I highly recommend this movie.",The Chronicles of Riddick

I made a few friends sit down and watch it with me, they ""Converted"".Some of the great things concerning this film is how they introduce technology or a race of characters, giving you enough information to fill in the gaps - but leaving enough room for your imagination to fill the voids. It honestly makes you crave a sequel, it could go so many ways. I just like that freedom of thought, instead of being force fed every detail.Just sit back and enjoy the film.

The story line was a little wack but once the action got picked up it was excellent. I can watch this movie over and over and over. I like how in all of the Riddick movies the main girl dies. This is something most other movies are to scared to do. Also the whole movie was filmed indoors and the background is all computer graphics, I didn't know this when I watched the movie. They did a great job on that, I only found out when I watched a interview of with David Twohy. The whole Anti-Hero thing is great, cause it makes it all the more interesting. Cause in like Spiderman the object is to get a girl and save the town. Well, Riddick didn't really want to help and he has a crap load of secrets. All the Anti-Heros are awesome like Riddick, Han Solo, Wolverine, etc. If you haven't seen this movie I highly recommend it because it is a movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat the whole time.",The Chronicles of Riddick
546,motordc,I was pleasantly surprised,8,22 July 2006,"I liked this movie. It is exciting to watch and it held my interest. Vin Diesel is very athletic and appears to do some amazing stunts. The plot was understandable, usually a challenge in science fiction, and the sequence of events flowed smoothly. The pace is excellent too, there very few lulls in the action and those were necessary to build up suspense. If I have any complaints it would be with the special effects. While most were excellent, I craved for more of them. There seemed to be some repetition of the same effects. The last thing that could have been improved, to my liking anyway, was a little more depth in the explanation of the Neuromonger culture. It seems that just a bit more of that would have made their motives clearer. Otherwise the movie is definitely worth seeing. I would say that The Chronicles of Riddick is better than Pitch Black; one does not have to be seen to appreciate the other. Enjoy.",The Chronicles of Riddick
547,scorpienrose,Chronicles of Riddick... Why all the slack? I just don't get it....,6,24 January 2005,"Okay, so the movie failed to follow the slick clean lines of the original, pitch black, and Riddick was changed from the cold, heartless killer who seemed to be slowly learning human emotions to a man who seemed a bit to full of himself, not as jaded and as if he was amused by what people thought of him, rather then just not caring. To me it seemed as if Vin Diesel allowed Riddick to be affected a bit to much by his XXX character, but even so maybe he had renewed faith in life when he saw others would sacrifice for him. A little comic book like, maybe, original definitely, like star wars, no, I don't think so. I think the writers had so many ideas that they tried to cram them all into one movie to the point there was no clear definition... but I think a good sequel could fix that. Revenge is best served cold, and an entire movie about a man who's lost everything twice and has all the power in the universe...well one the idea has merit and two maybe Riddick would be portrayed as he was meant to be, an anti-hero who may have some good qualities but in essence he's bad, so deal with it. Introducing a lover who wants to change him and ends up on his black list could also be cool, showing Riddick as a mans man who won't be leashed would make him a real hero...so how 'bout cutting it with talk of trashing the whole idea and instead thinking of a way to save an essentially good concept. To end this off I was angry when Kyra was killed, but in the end what I saw was potential, and maybe more people need to see it from that point of view. The little girl he help save, Kyra's death, his rebirth into ultimate power...can you see all this fa-dding into nothing...or are you maybe all just a little curious about what Riddick's gonna do with this whole mess...I know I am.",The Chronicles of Riddick

Pitch Black was a great sci-fi movie and I was confident that the sequel would be just as great or better.Then oddly from some acquaintances that I've known, seen the movie before me and gave it a Thumbs down review. I was distraught and disappointed at the reviews I was receiving. I avoided watching it for the longest time until I crashed at a buddy of mines place and found they had the DVD. So I gave'r a shot and popped it in. Boy was I fooled for the longest time. This movie was Great! I can't believe I haven't watched this movie sooner! The action was top notch and the clever sadistic Riddick was fit to the T in his character. There are some cheese parts I must admit but hell it makes up for it with the rhythm of the story.

The special effects were stunning. The Worlds the director took us too to. I'm thinking that people just don't like Vin Diesel which is a shame because all though I liked him in this movie there were many other facets of this movie worth seeing. This movie was like Conan meets Star Wars meets Dune. It had Alien Beasts, spaceships, dog fights, outlandish weapons and costumes, and the list goes on. I don't know what it takes to entertain people nowadays but IMO this movie was really good. Beacuase I know there are a lot of haters out there I'm gonna try to do my part to balance them out. The stunts and fights were well executed. Its not a kung-fu flick so don't come looking for crouching tiger hidden dragon. The problems I had with this movie were the names. I mean the Necromongers??? I'm thinking they could have done better. Or Underverse??? Its a little to simplistic I guess. I guess all the good names were taken already though like Zentrati and Invid so I gotta let it go. The acting wasn't too bad for a sci-fi flick. It isn't Gattaca so don't expect Gattaca.

It is worth seeing and watching over and over again. But, I do admit, it is somewhat confusing, you'll have to watch it more then once to understand it all. It may have not of been the same as Pitch Black, but it still had similarities, so you shouldn't get upset about that. If you are looking for a movie that is like Pitch Black, you will be a little disappointed, but it's still something you can enjoy.

551,Tsaravian,A bad review from a not-so-obsessed sci-fi fan,2,26 February 2005,"This movie is the reason I usually dismiss sci-fi movies. Riddick suddenly transforms from a bad-ass villain to a anti-hero do-gooder. Thus, making this movie a redundant action flick that has an over-used main character and plot. It is the classic formula: One man must save the universe by going against an army, and is revealed to be the last of his kind. Now, I seriously don't mean to compare 'Pitch Black' and this movie, but it's called ""Chronicles of Riddick"", meaning they should preserve the character Riddick, which they failed to do. Riddick seems to have found a sense of moral boundary, loosing a certain aspect of his persona. He becomes so weighted by this mission to save humanity that his attitude of survival of the fittest is sacrificed.Of course, this isn't the only flaw, Riddick losing his original personality. The villains are classic power-hungry tyrants who want to eliminate humanity or convert them. Gee, never heard of that before. The intense atmosphere of ruthless killing-machines(whether human or not), loss of allies, hope, and overall chances of survival is replaced by rescue missions that you know already know they'll succeed. By the time you know the main characters, you know who'll die and who won't.OVERALL: An unoriginal sci-fi/action movie, whether you compare it to 'Pitch Black' or not, and whether you're an avid sci-fi fan or not. The graphics can be found in any action film today and aren't going to be ground-breaking. Disregard those who said you'd ""have to watch it over again"" because its so confusing. It couldn't be more simplistic if you've seen 'Pitch Black'. And even if you haven't, it's still easy to catch onto. So if you are looking for a repetitive, sub-par movie that was a waste of money for the audience and the movie industry, this is just the movie for you!*And just so you know, I saw this at theaters at a screening with a friend, meaning I got in for free. So don't even waste money on it!",The Chronicles of Riddick

I was pleased that there was no 'nasty' violent scenes, and only one 4-letter word was used (pity because I don't think even that one was necessary).The special fx are very believable, even if the plot is a bit tongue-in-cheek.

The Necromongers are a very curious and interesting ""race"" (they have an evil charm, something like the Borgs) and I would like to see more of them and more about Riddick's past.And I really liked the twist at the ending.

Personally, I think that Vin Diesel should continue making the movies from the other screenplays that have already been written. The plot in these films (TCOR and Pitch Black) is actually quite original. From an action standpoint, the films do not lack anything. Riddick is the bad ass anti-hero that we would all like to be sometimes and they couldn't have cast the parts any better. There are some similarities between the Necros in TCOR and the Borg in the latter Star Trek movies, but who cares?

It is well filmed with great special effects, a pretty good cast with good enough acting, great action scenes and a story that is rich, detailed and interesting. The dialogue is sometimes a bit weak but again good enough for the genre and the characters. It really wouldn't fit the film if Riddick sprouted eloquently. He's an uneducated, though not unintelligent, character borne out of persecution, violence and brutality. A perfect anti-hero. I hope that the negative press by people who are looking at this movie through too narrow a lens doesn't prevent a sequel/prequel from being made.",The Chronicles of Riddick
556,kjayau,Overall impression of first half,4,16 April 2005,"I loved ""Pitch Black."" Thought it was quirky, atmospheric, suspenseful, well-paced, well-directed. ""The Chronicles of Riddick,"" while visually sumptuous, is such a mishmash of ideas that it makes the head spin with its ridiculous lingo--Underverse, Necromongers, Full-Dead, etc.--the dizzying melange of sources--MacBeth, Julius Ceasar, Dune, The Arthurian Legends, the Christ story, A Wrinkle in Time, Minority Report, Alien--and the strange plot holes which I won't discuss. The script should have the disclaimer, ""English Majors Gone Wild!"" It's actually just what Hollywood likes to do--throw a whole bunch of elements of previously successful movies/books into the mix. Oh, yeah, and don't forget Star Wars. I enjoy the Riddick character--I think Vin Diesel has risen to his level of thespian achievement here--and like watching the cartoon violence, but we could only take one half of it last night before the snickering and laughter drove us off to bed. We'll try to finish tonight. I can pretty well imagine how it ends, though . . . and that's something I couldn't say about Pitch Black, which I think is one of my top ten favorite Sci Fi movies. Very cool visuals; I love the attack on the Helian city (but not the Necromongers stomping around en masse like so many bowling pins with feet; don't moviemakers see actual training films for troops? Same thing happened in Starship Troopers, no sense of what combat would really look like for modern troops with extremely high firepower; point of ref., The Battle for Fallujah).",The Chronicles of Riddick

Vin Diesel's acting was at its best wooden. I have not seen Pitch Black and to be frank i think that that was a good thing as i am not defending the film because of its largely acclaimed prequel. the fight scenes, what was with the music, the music was playing but we couldn't hear the actual fight! whats with that. It was also unrealistic. You can't hind from a solar flare just my hiding behind a rock and if temperatures rise to 700 degrees c then it would take many days to cool down.The costumes were very dungeon's and dragons. it would have been so much better to have the lord Marshall in a one faced helmet. the multi faces was just silly.Overall a bad film, i would strongly advise buying a copy, so that you can then destroy it for the greater good of all!",The Chronicles of Riddick

Loved the concept, loved the action, loved the special effects. For those who want to complain about plot faults or plausibility all I have to say is, did you never enjoy Indianna Jones or James Bond? Many great sci-fi or action flicks require you to leave reality at the door and this is no different.Fortunatley I didn't know hardly anything about these movies before I watched them, and so had no expectations.

562,tom-lehman,"""Death by teacup"" LOL",1,1 October 2005,"I'm lost for words. I don't know how adults can have any part in the production of such trash.It features some of the most amateur performances I've ever seen including Vin Diesel's. Who thinks this guy can act? I wish movie producers would stop massaging his ego by casting him in this hard-as-nails hero role which seems to be the only string to the man's bow.It has storyline that an educated 5 year-old would laugh at that borrows from every half-baked sci-fi action flick ever conceived (Stargate definitely springs to mind). It also borrows the layered choir of 2001 for its score combined with the regular Hollywood orchestra-by-numbers audio devices that are all to common these days.This surely leaves only its visual impact as a possible saving grace. For a modern, high-budget film this is also pretty shocking. A lot of the early studio shots fail to convince that they are anything but that and the CGI looks like a late 90s computer game cut-screen. Perhaps even more disappointing for a film of this era/budget the CGI also fails to blend with the studio shots which further destroys any illusion of reality.Frankly I don't know why I've wasted my time even writing about this rubbish. Possibly as a justification for wasting my time watching it. Oh and don't get me started on the names. Elementals, Necromongers, Underverse or some such s**t. Fit for a spoof surely?",The Chronicles of Riddick
563,docmarten2525,Well.... I watched it to the end,5,13 October 2006,"The sad thing is not that this was an awful movie, but that it was just another stupid Hollywood SF flick, by which I mean that those who write and produce science fiction for Hollywood invariably seem to assume that everyone who watches it is a) 13; b) stupid; or c) drunk. Perhaps that's an overstatement, but for every half decent SF flick you seem to get 350 lousy ones. That this half baked, poorly explained, badly acted shoot-em-up is actually one of the better bits of SF coming out of Hollywood reflects very poorly on the movie making industry. This is not to say that it was completely without merit. Compared to the truly awful ""Starship Troopers"", Riddick was Oscar material. But for all the money that went into creating it... couldn't they have put together something actually worth spending 2 hours watching? Doc",The Chronicles of Riddick
564,tash_88,Riddick,10,29 October 2005,I have seen this film more then a 2000 time i think that is well made all of the effects and the action is brill. I have to say that Vin Diesel is a great actor plus has a great body. I wish that they would do another one it was a great story i got well in to it at the end when Riddick (Vin Diesel) was sat there it was very sad everybody that he cared for was dead. They way that ended if they really wanted to they could make some more of them i think that it would be well good more of that action with these great fight sense made it a great film to see can t wait to see some more great films from Vin Diesel all that action.,The Chronicles of Riddick
565,tonyenlow,excellent story,8,2 June 2019,"Riddick was a great character, this had a vast universe to play with, well done",The Chronicles of Riddick
566,emilysphillips,This movie ferrets out the morons among critics,10,29 January 2006,"Historically (without much history to go on), I have never been a Vin Diesel fan. This film changed my mind about the dude, and changed my opinion that the studios will never let artists (i.e. Twohy) have the support (financially and creatively) that they need to tell a real story, not mindless pap.I have avoided this movie since release(as well as its predecessor, Pitch Black). I caught PB last week at the insistence of a friend and just had to grab this one. Wow.Set design, special effects, acting, direction, story! story! story! and characterization quality oozes out of every sepia-toned pore of this film. Is it perfect? It really feels close.There has to be a sequel. Let's get those DVD sales up.",The Chronicles of Riddick
567,gleobeam,"Terrifying view of civilization - stark, sharp, gloom and thrills",9,17 March 2006,"Amazing effects, great acting, directing, production.Science Fiction at its best -- dialog and characters burning close to reality flames with beautiful panoramas and other worlds needed to lift the viewer to gripping suspense and terror.Vin Deisel is certainly the only actor for making the animal/psychic/human/warrior work.Totally impressive sets. Excellent segues. Quick, sharp and concise dialog forces the audience to PAY ATTention.A premise and ending worth thinking out. Excellent screenplay.Enjoy this thriller!",The Chronicles of Riddick
568,Vazel,This movie ruined the character of Riddick,1,7 April 2009,"The Riddick in Pitch Black is one of the best characters ever conceived in sci-fi because of his simplicity. There was nothing special about him. He was a hardened criminal making stuff up as he went along, caring for no one but himself. Even his night vision is something he got from a doctor in prison in exchange for 20 packs of cigarettes. The movie itself took place in a shitty corner of the galaxy no one cares about. It was a big breath of fresh air from all the other movies where the entire universe seems to revolve around the characters. Then in Chronicles of Riddick they made him into a Furyan chosen one with magic and mysticism everywhere and now Riddick is a master schemer strategist with a heart of gold. And his night vision got retconned into a supernatural gift in the tie- in video game(although other than that the video game was actually good).",The Chronicles of Riddick
569,captainhowdyme2,i thought it was an OK movie,6,6 January 2006,"I thought that it was an OK movie. It could have been better, the story could have been better explained. All of the little side stories could have been explained better also. overall it was an OK movie, the thing I liked the best was the mass ownage. The CGI was awesome too though. I didn't really like the actor that played the Lord Marshall, i didn't think that he fits the part. Usually I don't like Vin Diesel but he did a pretty good job with playing Riddick. Also another aspect of the movie that i didn't really like was the fact that most of the movie took place on a sound stage, I mean CGI is awesome but also I think the touch of realism is always good.",The Chronicles of Riddick
570,rowanberry-46261,One of my favourite movies,10,6 June 2018,"What can i say? badass character, plenty of content, a whole universe to explore. As a vin diesel movie this has got to be one of the best. No need to compare it to 'Pitch Black', Like Frasier in 'Cheers', Pitch black introduces the character and is a completely different movie in it's own right. (Although i do prefer chronicles)If you are looking for plenty of sci-fi, some cheesy lines, action and a pretty good watch, look no further you have found your movie. The only thing i wish was different was that the sequal 'Riddick' was more like the chronicles of riddick and continued to explore his universe rather than going back to a pitch black esque cinematic. Characters are meant to move forward and develop, not to go back a few steps because it was great the first time",The Chronicles of Riddick
571,kupanoff,Really not bad...at least subjectively speaking,7,2 December 2006,"Granted, my overall rating of this movie is probably inflated a bit because I was expecting it to be terrible...and I'll admit, it's not a ""great"" movie...However, an objective viewing of this movie might very well lead you to the conclusion that it's as good, if not better than, quite a few other sci-fi action movies in recent years that were at least supposed/expected to be legitimately good...such as The Star Wars Prequels and the Matrix Sequels.Over the last 10 years or so, there have a handful of rather underrated sci-fi action movies - this is one of them...along with, for example, Blade, Underworld, and Equilibrium (again, not necessarily good movies - but really not that bad).",The Chronicles of Riddick
572,joshua-elinoff,"Necromonger = Deathbringer, Huh?",6,9 May 2006,"This movie had a lot going for it. I was very anxious to check it out after the success of Pitch Black. While the original was a definite seven,(which to me means the movie is very entertaining and very re-watchable)The new installment was great in it's effects and presentation. The one major caveat was the Necromonger name and society structure. The contrived Roman themes seemed very unoriginal. Like a sub-par episode of Star Trek. This movie had the potential to best it's predecessor, if only they had tried harder. I think that if they had just changed such a small thing as the name Necromonger this movie would be a seven. Instead I will cringe every time that I hear it. That is why a low six score is warranted.",The Chronicles of Riddick
