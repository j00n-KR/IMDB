0,TheLittleSongbird,Worth staying awake for,7,1 January 2018,"The original 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' is still to me one of the scariest and best horror films there is, as well as a truly great film in its own right and introduced us to one of the genre's most iconic villains in Freddy Krueger. It is always difficult to do a sequel that lives up to a film as good as 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' let alone one to be on the same level.After the 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' series showed signs of severe fatigue, that it was suggestive of the series being completely dead, original director Wes Craven makes a welcome return and brings new, fresh life to the series. 'New Nightmare' may not be as good as the original, none of the follow-ups are (though two of the previous sequels, the third and fourth, were good), but it is the best of the follow-ups since the third and is one of the best in the series. 'New Nightmare' has its faults. Its biggest one is the ending, it is just ridiculous and jars tonally with the rest of the film, which took a darker and more serious direction (perhaps more so than the original). Count me in as another person who didn't care for Freddy's look here, it looks rather goofy and doesn't do Robert Englund's creepy performance and the way Freddy's written justice. Heather Langenkamp also seemed a bit bland and seemed rather anaemic for a character written more dramatically than previously. On the other hand, 'New Nightmare' looks very atmosphere and made with a good deal of style and slickness. The production design has a suitably nightmarish look and the special effects are great and perhaps superior to the original's. The music score is haunting.The writing may lack the one-liners seen before, but the more serious direction the dialogue took was appreciated after the fifth and sixth films did such a poor job with the one-liners and comedy. The dialogue isn't mind-blowing but it flows decently and intrigues at least. The semi-documentary-style adopted for some of the film is very interesting, making for one of the most original ideas of the follow-ups and the series overall too, while still delivering on the shocks, suspense and creepiness. Despite the goofy look for Freddy, Englund is very creepy and even with not much screen time he burns long in the memory. In summary, one of the series' better entries and worth staying awake for. 7/10 Bethany Cox",New Nightmare
1,SnoopyStyle,meta-horror,8,9 August 2016,"Heather Langenkamp is happily living in L.A. with husband Chase Porter and their young son Dylan despite the earthquakes. Her fame in the 'Nightmare on Elm Street' has resurfaced as the 10th anniversary approaches. She keeps getting prank calls and signs of Freddy. Producer Robert Shaye wants her to rejoin the franchise to star in Wes Craven's New Nightmare. Dylan is getting more disturbed by a mystery man and Chase is working on a new Freddy glove. Freddy kills Chase who fell asleep while driving. Julie (Tracy Middendorf) is the babysitter.Wes Craven brings in various Nightmare alumni including Robert Englund, and John Saxon as themselves. This is not actually a Nightmare movie until the second half. The first half is really a meta-horror. It brings the Nightmare universe into the real world. It is quite effective. It's also great to have Langenkamp back and she hasn't changed. This is a great way to put a bow on the original movies. The hospital is nice. I really love the scene where John Saxon turns. Wes shows that he continues to build on the horror genre.",New Nightmare
2,claudio_carvalho,The Evil Never Dies,7,31 March 2009,"The actress Heather Langencamp lives in Los Angeles with her husband Chase Porter (David Newsom), who is secretly working in a mechanical hand for the next movie of Freddy Kruger, and their son Dylan (Miko Hughes). During an earthquake, Heather has a dreadful nightmare where Chase's partners die; in the morning she is invited to be the guest of a talk show about the tenth anniversary of ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" with the presence of Robert Englund. Later the executive of New Line Cinema Robert Shaye invites her to perform Nancy Thompson again in the latest project of Wes Craven based on his own nightmares, but she turns the invitation down. Heater is being disturbed by a man that calls her in the telephone and sends creepy letters to her. When Dylan has nightmares with a man with claw and tells that he is protected by his T-Rex toy showing symptoms of schizophrenia, and Chase dies in a car accident, Heather becomes paranoid with Freddy Krueger. The reactions of Robert Englund and Wes Craven indicate to her that something is going wrong. Further she discovers that Freddy is an entity that does exist and is an ancient demon trying to use her weakness as the gateway to the real world. Heater needs to face the evil Freddy Kruger to protect her beloved son.""New Nightmare"" is an original approach to bring Freddy Krueger back after his death in ""Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare"". The story blends reality with fiction and transforms Freddy Krueger in a millenary evil entity that tries to reach the real world through the actress Heather Langencamp, giving a survivorship to this character. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""A Hora do Pesadelo 7 – O Novo Pesadelo – O Retorno de Freddy Krueger"" (""The Hour of the Nightmare 7 – The New Nightmare – The Return of Freddy Krueger"")",New Nightmare
3,lee_eisenberg,coming for you...,6,2 August 2006,"We all should have guessed that Freddy Krueger wasn't dead at the (supposed) end of the series, and ""New Nightmare"" proves it. This time, the claw-handed killer comes back for one final showdown. The only thing is, it's happening to the real Heather Langenkamp, who played Nancy in the original movie. And no longer is Freddy spouting out silly one-liners; he's now a lot more evil, and determined to get Heather's son Dylan.I always expect something neat from Wes Craven, and he doesn't disappoint here. I really liked how Craven builds everything up so that we don't quite know what's going on, and then he hits us with it. It was a most unique concept having Langenkamp, Robert Englund and John Saxon all play themselves (Craven also plays himself in one scene), plus the original characters. There are some gory parts, natch (the scene in the car was really something), but Craven knows how to do it right.All in all, this is one movie that you'll probably enjoy. Especially the last line in the movie. Also starring Miko Hughes and Robert Shaye.",New Nightmare
4,jboothmillard,Wes Craven's New Nightmare,5,15 June 2013,"It looked like for some time Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare was the final time scary movie fans would see the iconic razor handed ""Son of 100 Maniacs"", but then original film writer and director Wes Craven (The Hills Have Eyes, Scream) came up with this clever comeback. Basically the tenth anniversary of the movie A Nightmare on Elm Street is coming up, and original star Heather Langenkamp is part of the special events celebrating, along with its director Wes Craven, and of course the man behind killer Freddy Krueger, actor Robert Englund. She has a happy life with husband Chase Porter (David Newsom) and son Dylan (Miko Hughes), but she is being stalked by a nasty voice on the phone, and creepy goings on in her house, and things get worse when her husband is killed in a car crash, and his body has slash marks on it. Dylan is refusing to sleep anymore, because he is scared, like the movie, that Freddy will come in his dream and try to kill him, and dealing with this Heather is also being offered a part in the next Nightmare film Wes is working on, but the script needs work. Heather is finding the behaviour of her son uncontrollable, and she does believe Freddy is haunting her, Wes comes up with the theory that now the Elm Street films are over an ancient spirit must have helped him come out of the fictional world to enter dreams in real life, and his script may be part of this way out. It comes to the point when Dylan may be taken away from Heather due to his psychologically disturbed behaviour, but she is also incarcerated by doctors who believe she is going mad, of course Freddy continues his kills while this is going on. Eventually Heather, like her character, enters a dream to confront Freddy and stop the terror, and she manages to lock him in a furnace to burn to death, and returning to the real world she and her son read the new finished sample script sent by Wes. I like films where actors play a version of themselves, you could see this as semi-documentary considering the concept of how to bring back a character supposedly dead for good, the story has its moments of irritation, especially with the doctors breaking up the mother and son, but the script has clever references and ideas, and there is just enough Freddy and gore for the fans, a not bad horror film. Worth watching!",New Nightmare
5,ccthemovieman-1,Slick & Scary But lacked Something (Humor?),5,12 September 2006,"This was an interesting concept with real-life actors from the ""Nightmare On Elm Street"" horror series playing themselves (Robert England, Heather Langenkamp, John Saxon, etc.) but then caught up in another ""Freddy"" story. It wound up being a commentary on the question: ""Does watching horror movies affect people?""Being this movie was made about a decade after most of the other ""Nightmares"", this film had a slicker took to it, the picture and sound being sharper. It's scary, too, but not as much fun to watch as the others. It didn't have Freddy's sense of humor, mainly, and that was missed. This story took itself too seriously.It kept my attention the whole way, and was better on the profanity but it just lacked something.",New Nightmare
6,ma-cortes,Again Freddie Krueger with his hideously scarred face and knives terrorizing Heather and family,6,22 December 2011,"Modern rendition about the myth Freddy dealing with young people discover they're having the same terrible nightmares . New version about Freddy Krueger killing people in macabre style and boasts some startling , gruesome special effects . A re-imagining of the classic Freddy Krueger, a serial-killer who wields a glove with four blades embedded in the fingers and murders people in their dreams , resulting in their real death in reality . Nowadays, it's nearing the 10th Anniversary of the picture 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' and one of the protagonists , (Heather Langenkamp) starts to be haunted in their nightmares by scar-faced and dream-hunting Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund now fits likes a glove) , a kind of spectre with awful burns , in stripy jumper and large knives. He enters their dreams at will and again kill them. Heather Langenkamp is being scared by a voice on a telephone , sounding very similar to the movie's nasty, Freddy Krueger . When Heather's husband (David Newsom) is killed in a car crash and is discovered with slash marks on him, Heather starts to wonder somethings . Heathe learns that Freddy has now entered the real world . The unsettling Heather plagued by astonishing dreams helps her son (Miko Hughes) to attempt to stop the nasty and demonic Freddy who kill people in macabre ways . Mother and son are having the same bad dream in which a malicious bogeyman is frightening them with knives attached to his fingers and the dream becomes reality . Heather sets out to discover the truth by attempting to draw the bogeyman out of the dream .This is a diverting reworking upon first film's plot by screenwriter Wes Craven based on his characters and dealing with the imaginative premise about a kind of ghost who can enter their dreams at will and intents on taking over both his body and mind . The twisted script dishes up the requisite helping of one-liners and throwaway black humor . This eerie film packs thrills , chills , creepy events and lots of blood and gore . It's a flimsily plotted but visually enjoyable addition to the Krueger endless saga . There are a few genuinely inspired events , notably Freddy's appearances and the extraordinary body-ripping spotlights in the Hospital room . Although it results to be a franchise that we now know was to follow , there are some originally frightening dream sequences. Special and extravagant visual effects are the climax of the movie and the startling make-up on Freddy face , but both of them don't save the story . Young casting and special appearance by John Saxon , the same Wes Craven and Robert Shaye , film's producer . Creepy and imaginatively made musical score fitting to terror movie by J. Peter Robinson . Colorful and atmospheric cinematography by Mark Irwin . The motion picture well produced by the great producer Robert Shaye from New Line Cinema and is professionally directed by Wes Craven , though with no originality and nothing new to show . Wes's sure grasp of the skewed logic of nightmares help to sustain the ambiguity between the dream and real world . Rating : 5,5 , passable sequel . It's all acceptable scary fun .The series initiates itself from original entry title ¨A Nightmare on Elm Elm Street¨ directed by Wes Craven with Heather Langenkamp , Johnny Depp , Amanda Wyss and John Saxon . The rest is a series of disjointed but however impressive special effects pieces . As it was followed by a handful of sequels in which horrifying special effects dominate this slasher saga , as ¨Freddy's revenge¨ 1985 by Jack Sholder with Kim Myers , Clu Gulager and Hope Lange ; ¨Dream warrior¨ 1987 by Chuck Russell with Patricia Arquette , Larry Fishburne and Craig Wasson , it's one of the best sequels from successful original film by Craven , as ¨Dream master¨ (1988) by Renny Harlin with Lisa Wilcox , Tuesday Knight and ¨The dream child¨ (1989) by Stephen Hopkins with Lisa Wilcox , Erika Anderson . Besides a Television series ¨The Freddy's nightmares¨ and this last one ¨ A nightmare on Elm Street¨(2010) with Jackie Haley that is a simple copy with little imagination , too many flaws and giving routine treatment .",New Nightmare
7,BA_Harrison,Wes Craven returns to try and salvage the series.,7,3 May 2007,"Two years before doing the same with his hugely successful movie Scream, Wes Craven applied a post-modernistic approach to New Nightmare, the seventh film to feature Freddy Krueger, the dead child murderer who enters his victim's dreams in order to kill them.Keen to distance his film from the last few sequels, in which Freddy had slowly morphed from frightening bogeyman into a trashy comedy/horror pop icon, Craven cleverly takes his creation out of the movies and into 'real-life'. New Nightmare sees actress Heather Langenkamp (Nancy from Pts 1 & 3) playing herself, and becoming convinced that the monster from her films is somehow escaping his fictional realm to kill in the real world.This imaginative and, at times, admittedly rather silly concept is a refreshing change from the formula of the preceding few Nightmare movies, which had grown stale and distinctly unscary, and allows the makers of New Nightmare to start afresh, since they are not bound by anything that went before.It also provides a great excuse to gather together the cast and crew of the earlier films and show them having fun playing themselves: Robert Shaye (New Line producer), John Saxon (who plays Nancy's father in Pts 1 & 3), Robert Englund (Freddy, of course) and even Wes Craven (who takes an amusing swipe at those responsible for trashing his original creation) all appear, with even the 'non-actors' giving surprisingly good performances.As the story progresses, it transpires that the creature that has been causing poor Heather so much trouble is in fact a demon that has been trapped within the Freddy persona. But with the gradual watering down of the character and Freddy's eventual death in Part 6 (Freddy's Dead), the evil being is now free to break out of his cinematic prison and cause some real damage.The only trouble with such an interesting concept is that it soon becomes too complicated for its own good, with lapses in logic, some boring moments required to explain what the hell is happening, and an inevitably confusing finale.Ultimately, this is a nice, but not altogether successful attempt by Craven at salvaging a character that had well and truly been stomped into the dirt by other film-makers.6.5 out of 10 (rounded up to 7 for IMDb).",New Nightmare
8,Quinoa1984,One of Craven's best,7,4 April 2000,"Wes Craven's New Nightmare is a trip that he hasn't taken us since 1984. The movie is scary as hell, the characters are well thought out, and it is entertaining throughout.  True, some might think the 7th installment in this classic horror saga isn't worth a second look, let alone viewing.  But I think Craven has not lost his touch yet, and is still able to make us afraid to go to sleep at night.  And this film proves it.  Robert Englund, Wes Craven, and everybody else who acted and worked on this film did a good job, and didn't go for cheap-ness.  A+",New Nightmare
9,BandSAboutMovies,A little bit better...,5,31 October 2018,"Originally, this film was going to be A Nightmare on Elm Street 7: The Ascension, but Wes Craven had the goal of creating a more intelligent meditation on the effects of horror on those who created it. He also wanted to bring Freddy closer to what he envisioned him as being in the original film, both in look and how he behaves.Heather Langenkamp, yes played by Heather Langenkamp, played Nancy Thompson in the first and third movies in the Elm Street movies, but now she keeps dreaming that Freddy is coming for her, her husband Chase and her son Dylan (Miko Hughes, Gage from Pet Semetary). She awakens to an earthquake tearing through her house and a prank caller who continually keeps phoning in Freddy's nursery rhyme.After a talk show appearance with an in-costume Robert Englund, Heather learns that New Line Cinema wants her to work on a new Elm Street film that her husband has already been doing effects for. And when she arrives home, her son is watching the first film, screaming at her when she tries to turn it off. She calls her husband to help and as he rushes home, he falls asleep at the wheel and is killed by Freddy.At the funeral, she has another vision of Freddy and John Saxon - you better believe I stood on my couch and cheered - tells her that she needs help. Dylan refuses to sleep and becomes obsessed with Krueger, which leads to her visiting series creator Wes Craven, played by, you knew it, Wes Craven.Craven explains that Freddy has always been alive, a supernatural creature that attached itself to the films and was freed when Freddy died for the last time in the fifth film (perhaps it was just that he was upset that that one is so bad). Englund knows even more, but soon disappears from all contact.After an aftershock to the earthquake, Heather takes Dylan to the hospital, where the doctor on call believes that he's being abused. While police have her under custody, Freddy appears and kills the babysitter much like the first kill in the first film.Dylan sleepwalks across a crowded freeway with Nancy in pursuit as the film grows more nightmarish - yes, I know that was super literal. After being injured saving him, Heather returns home, only to learn that John Saxon has now become her/Nancy's father Don Thompson. She decides to embrace her old role and Freddy emerges into reality, taking her son into her world.Working together, Dylan and Heather/Nancy shove Freddy into an oven - echoing how the parents of Elm Street stopped him in the original story - murdering him. They awake in bed, with a copy of the film's script close behind. There's a note from Craven, thanking her for defeating Freddy and playing Nancy one last time. Now, she has jailed the demon into the film's world all over again. Dylan asks if it's just a story and Heather says that yes, it has all just been a story. Yet that's up to debate, as In the ending credits, Freddy Krueger is listed as playing himself.If the end result is similar to Fulci's A Cat in the Brain, this was not lost on the Italian godfather of gore (and emperor of eviscerated eyeballs). In his lone U.S. convention appearance (at the January 1996 Fangoria Horror Convention in New York City), Fulci would claim that New Nightmare rips off his film.",New Nightmare
10,Coventry,Disgustingly pretentious crap!,1,15 September 2005,"The 1984 ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" was a reasonably good and original horror movie and not one of the five direct sequels ever lived up to the quality of Wes Craven's original. That's pretty much a fact and I don't think anyone in his or her right state of mind would dispute this, right? So why did Wes Craven think it was absolutely necessary to make another sequel only to state this obvious fact? I've never been Craven's biggest fan and, maybe I'm very biased, but what nerve does this man have for making this movie revolve entirely on himself!! Who made him king of the horror genre? Who permitted him to glorify his own work and to belittle the efforts of other horror directors? ""Wes Craven's New Nightmare"" (very few directors deserve to have their names as a prefix to the title, by the way, and Craven is certainly not one of them) simply is the most pretentious movie I ever saw and it's disgusting to see how conceited Craven walks around in front of his own camera. In this final ""Elm Street""-movie, he has the guts to present his Freddy-'creation' as a phenomenon his original film as a genuine milestone. ""New Nightmare"" implements the film-within-film structure and those movies always suck! Actors look stupid when they play themselves and they in fact look extra fake when attempting to look natural. There's very few suspense, even though Craven desperately tries to create some, and the special effects are truly weak. The whole climax (set in some sort of supposedly nightmarish mausoleum) is absolutely pathetic and even worse than some of the 'embarrassing' non-Craven sequels.",New Nightmare
11,bevo-13678,What???,10,1 April 2020,Freddy's back. I told you so. You can't keep a good thing down,New Nightmare
12,preppy-3,Very interesting. It ALMOST works.,7,23 March 2008,"**PLOT SPOILERS** Heather Langenkamp plays herself in this. She has a (fictional) husband and child. She starts having nightmares about Freddy Krueger (Langenkamp starred in the first ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" movie) at the same time that Wes Craven is writing a new ""Nightmare"" script. Krueger was killed in 1991 but Craven decided to try it one last time. Krueger does NOT exist but it seems a demonic force is using his persona to come into the real world...and kill Langenkamp because she was the first one to ""kill"" him. I applaud Wes Craven for this idea (he wrote the script and directed this). It's very inventive and a good way to bring back a classic horror character without insulting the audience. It's very well done with excellent special effects and it's fun to see Robert Englund, Wes Craven, John Saxon etc etc appearing as themselves. But, sadly, it just doesn't work. Certain key ingredients are lacking.First is Langenkamp--she's just awful. She tries (you can tell she is) but she basically is just going through the motions. I never believed her for one second. Her young son (well played by Miko Hughes) is constantly being put in danger or is seeing people slashed to death. I don't like seeing children used that way in any picture. The movie is also too long and the script sometimes gets repetitive--at least SEVEN earthquakes hit L.A. in the course of one week. Is that really factual? Also Freddy is sorely missed in this one until the last 20 minutes or so.This was not a big hit at the box office--I heard it made less than any other ""Nightmare"" film ever. I don't think fans enjoyed having Krueger ""explained"" away. Critics however loved it--that's very unusual for any horror movie. If you're a horror fan you should try to take a look at this. If not--use your own judgment.",New Nightmare
13,poolandrews,An interesting idea but not a great film.,5,8 April 2010,"New Nightmare is set in Los Angeles as actress Heather Langenkamp (herself) has been having disturbing nightmares about Freddy Krueger, the burnt killer character featured in her film A Nightmare on Elm Street. Along with sinister telephone calls from someone sounding like Freddy & Heather's young son Dylon (Miko Hughes) has also been suffering from nightmares featuring the razor fingered killer Freddy. Heather is called to New Line Cinema where film producer Robert Shaye (himself) say's director Wes Craven has been working on a new Elm Street script & that her character Nancy is the star. Heather ask's how long Wes has been working on the script & discovers he started at the same time her nightmares & the phone calls began, talking to Wes he believes that Freddy was the incarnation of some ancient evil that was trapped inside the Elm Street films but since Freddy was killed in the final Elm Street film this evil wants to continue it's killing spree in the real world in the guise of Freddy...Written, executive produced & directed by Wes Craven who also has a small role in the film as himself New Nightmare was the seventh entry in the popular Elm Street franchise & the first to be directed by Craven since the original A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984), Craven takes the series in a totally new direction & New Nightmare has a really intriguing & original concept behind it but ultimately I didn't think it was that good a film overall. New Nightmare is more of a thriller than a horror film to be honest, the idea of Langenkamp being haunted & menaced by the villain of one of her films is strange to see unfold, if you have watched the other Elm Street films then watching New Nightmare is odd as the previous films are just films & Freddy is a fictional character before the weak horror elements kick in & Freddy becomes a reality. It takes a while even for Freddy to show up, it's over an hour before he does actually & the body count is low. The dream sequences aren't that memorable & I don't understand what the significance of the earthquakes were all about either. The character's mostly play themselves although Dylan the small kid is annoying & feels unneeded at times especially the climax where I really wanted to see Heather & Freddy have a real go at each other but Dylan just gets in the way.The film looks OK but there's lots of dull melodramatics about Heather's worries for her Dylan & the doctor's who treat him, it just gets boring & waiting for Freddy to turn up doesn't help. Even though the Elm Street sequels largely have a bad reputation I quite liked them & audiences liked them for Freddy, his one-liners & the inventive death's & New Nightmare in a way is the complete opposite, there's no real emphasis on the kills, Freddy gets little screen time & the film takes itself extremely seriously so whereas maybe New Nightmare is more original & daring than the six previous Elm Street films it's nowhere near as fun or entertaining. There's little gore to speak of, Freddy stabs a couple of people with his razor fingers but basically nothing else, even the new make-up job on Freddy looks bad although his new bio-mechanical glove looks cool. There's a pretty good scene as Dylan & Heather dodge cars on a freeway but otherwise the whole film feels quite empty.The least successful of the Elm Street films it's odd to see the HQ of New Line Cinema since now they don't exist anymore as they went belly up after one flop too many. The acting is alright, Langenkamp is OK but lets face it outside the Elm Street films she hasn't done anything, Robert Englund is back as himself & Freddy while John Saxon also returns from the original.New Nightmare is a film with a great premise & takes the Elm Street franchise in a completely different direction but it's just not that great a film, it's not much fun to watch, at almost two hours it's overlong & the lack of any real horror means this gets dumped in the wasted potential drawer never to be seen again.",New Nightmare
14,utgard14,"""At last, Freddy is back where he belongs.""",7,31 October 2015,"The Nightmare on Elm Street series certainly had its ups and downs (mostly downs). The first film was a horror classic but only one of the subsequent five sequels was worth a damn. That one, A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors, saw the return of Heather Langenkamp to the series as Nancy Thompson and Elm Street creator Wes Craven contributing the screenplay. So it should come as no surprise that the next Elm Street movie that had any value would also involve Craven and Langenkamp. Craven returns here as both writer and director, bringing to life a unique idea that he had actually pitched for part 3 a decade before. The idea is that Freddy Krueger steps into the real world and torments Heather Langenkamp (playing herself). It's all very meta, blending real-life elements of Langenkamp's life with the fictional Freddy nightmare stuff. It's a clever idea and one New Line was never going to take a chance on until they had already destroyed the franchise with all those crappy sequels that turned Freddy into a cartoon character.For the most part, the cast is good with several of the cast members playing themselves. Heather Langenkamp turns in a solid performance. Robert Englund plays both himself and Freddy, which is fun to watch. In addition to writing and directing, Wes Craven also acts here and does an admirable job, especially when compared to some other directors' embarrassing attempts at acting (John Carpenter and John Landis, for example). The only real negative about the cast is Miko Hughes as Heather's son. Little Miko was pretty cute in movies like Kindergarten Cop and a recurring role on the TV series Full House. But here he's required to do drama and, to be blunt, he sucks.It's an interesting movie but not a straight slasher flick so it will probably disappoint those who were fans of the cheesy Elm Street sequels. I didn't care for them much so I appreciated this movie for being different. Not everything works (Miko Hughes, the earthquake stuff, the redesigned Freddy) but overall it's a very enjoyable movie that takes a fresh approach to a tired concept. Fans of Wes Craven and the original Elm Street film will probably like it more than those expecting a movie full of Freddy eviscerating teenagers while making bad puns.",New Nightmare
15,Boba_Fett1138,"Different from any of the other A Nightmare on Elm Street movies, in a positive way.",7,10 October 2009,"This is a very original entry in the A Nightmare on Elm Street movie series, that unlike as any of its other sequels is a real stand alone movie, that picks its own approach and features a greatly written story.It's truly due to its unusual but great story that this movie is being so original. It's a movie within a movie, that focuses around some of the cast and crew from the original ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" who are being haunted by the 'real' Freddy Krueger this time. It was fun seeing Heather Langenkamp, Robert Englund and Wes Craven all playing themselves and talking about the Elm Street movies.It's a real refreshing movie that picks a totally different approach and story this time but also a different Freddy. This Freddy is more dark and killer like. The Robert Englund Krueger from the previous was more playful with his victims. The Freddy Krueger in this movie is still being played by Robert Englund though by the way.It's funny that all of the A Nightmare on Elm Street movies which Wes Craven had been directly involved with as a director or writer, or both, are also among the best out of the series. Craven returned for this movie as a director and it's also easily one of the better directed movies, when compared to the other sequels. The movie is greatly horror like with its approach and overall execution of things. It shows that Craven is a real expert, who's best years are perhaps long behind him but he still more than capable of directing a decent horror film, with also plenty of originality and passion for the genre to it.As an horror movie this is simply being a good one. It also easily can be watched aside from any of the previous A Nightmare on Elm Street movies, so those who aren't familiar with any of the previous movies and are curious about this film should watch it, though it's still recommendable that you've at least seen the first 1984 movie to understand its characters and premise, as well as some of its insight information and jokes given within this movie.An original and also great entry into the A Nightmare on Elm Street movie franchise.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",New Nightmare
16,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Perhaps not all it could have been, but still the best other than the original",7,5 August 2010,"This is not for everyone. Those who like the series(and the fact that it is one) won't be satisfied by this, and it wasn't made with them in mind. Craven returns, and he has a high concept. Does he completely pull it off? Not without a scrape here and there along the way, and the execution of the smart, meta concept isn't entirely spot-on. The plot is engaging: After all the sequels(that this rightfully pokes a little fun at without losing its seriousness), the man who gave us the '84 classic returns. He's had a new idea. At the same time, Langenkamp is experiencing strange phenomena. Has Krueger crossed into the real world? This does what these badly needed; it makes him scary again. Scratch that. It makes him freaking terrifying! How does it go about this? After five flicks that fleshed him out, this drops all of that, giving him back his mystery(and building him up). This is not the one we've gotten used to. He's darker(no, I mean that... and no, I didn't think it could happen, either), pure evil(he does still use a few one-liners). This is a fairly deep, reflective piece, and it comments on censorship(fitting that it be one of Wes' only films that he got final cut on) and the nature of the genre and why it is important. There are callbacks to the first one, worked in well and not making it campy. This is genuinely funny, never trying too hard. It is filmed and edited really well, and plays on primal fears once again. This is suspenseful, creepy and astonishingly intense(the latter especially in the memorable and grand finale). The effective and eerie score helps a lot. Acting varies a tad, though the leads do well and no one is *awful*. The kid is pretty good, if at times annoying. I found myself liking, relating to and caring about the characters. There is a lot of blood, a little gore, disturbing and disgusting content and occasional strong language in this. The Ultimate Collector's Edition 7-Disc DVD set comes with an excellent, informational and interesting director's commentary, 32 and a half minutes of informative interviews, the Jump To A Nightmare feature and a great trailer. I recommend this to anyone that it sounds appealing to. 7/10",New Nightmare
17,view_and_review,The Nightmare Nobody Asked For,3,18 August 2020,"A New Nightmare is unwanted, unneeded, and unsolicited. It's nothing more than a movie trying to get by on a name.In A New Nightmare Heather Langenkamp plays herself, thereby breaking the fourth wall. It's hard keeping it straight that she isn't Nancy, but her real actress self who played Nancy in ANOES one and three. It's clear why Heather never got any other big roles. I don't want to say she's awful, but I'll say she's not that good.A New Nightmare cannot be taken seriously. The fact that it's supposed to be occurring in real life with the real Heather Langenkamp, the real Robert Englund, and the real Wes Craven just makes the movie such a joke. Was it a shameless money grab? Was it a waning writer trying to recapture past glory? Was it a lazy fulfillment of a contract? Whatever it was, it was a shame. There was no need to do it. The Nightmare on Elm St. franchise had already been plenty maligned by pretty much every ANOES after the first. Why add to the ignominy?",New Nightmare
18,Uriah43,A Solid Addition to the Franchise,5,8 September 2020,"Having performed in several different ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" films, ""Heather Langenkamp"" (as herself) is now married to a special effects artist named ""Chase Porter"" (David Newsom) and together they are raising their young son ""Dylan Porter"" (Miko Hughes). As it so happens, she has lately been experiencing nightmares similar to certain scenes in her ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" films. Adding to her overall stress is the fact that she has been receiving several crank phone calls which have been compounded by earthquakes during that same time. If that wasn't enough, Dylan has suddenly become sick and with that his behavior has changed-and then people start dying all around her. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a solid addition to the ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" franchise which benefited by having actors like John Saxon, Robert Englund and the aforementioned Heather Langemkamp perform as themselves and under their real names. It was an interesting touch. On the flip side, however, while I liked the special effects I thought the suspense was somewhat lacking and for that reason I have rated it accordingly.

19,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Immensely enjoyable and entertaining,9,16 August 2012,"After a series of nightmares and her son's strange behavior, an actress becomes convinced a famous serial killer from her movie history has come into the real world and targeting her and her family, forcing her to stop him using the tricks from the movies.This here turned out to be a decent if slightly flawed entry. Among the many things that work here is the fact that, by tying into the film series as a whole separate entity away from the reality presented here, it manages to be a lot smarter than it usually would be for this type of film, and that's something to commend by having the actors playing themselves instead of the film roles. That makes the typically-clichéd is-it-all-a-dream-or-not set-up far more effective than it has any right to be, given even more credence with Freddy's return to being scary again. Dropping any semblance of wise-cracks, puns and lame jokes, reduced screen time and really only appearing to do damage make him a credible, scary force again, and that helps this out tremendously. With some great action in here, a lot of great special effects and a fantastic finale, this has a lot going for it but there's still a few problems here, mainly in the film's continued usage of the annoying child who does nothing but scream and does nothing to the film overall. The low kill count means there's little variety to be found as well, but overall this isn't all too bad.Rated R: Violence, Language, and children in jeopardy",New Nightmare
20,FlashCallahan,Lets do lunch....,7,16 July 2010,"It's nearing the 10th Anniversary of the film 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' and one of the stars, Heather Langenkamp is being scared by a voice on a phone, sounding very similar to the film's villain, Freddy Krueger. When Heather's husband is killed in a car accident and is discovered with slash marks on him, Heather starts to wonder something. Especially when she discovers that Wes Craven is writing another 'Nightmare' film. Soon, she realises that Freddy has now entered the real world, and the only way to defeat him is to become Nancy Thompson once again....An excellent premise and story, was largely ignored on initial release, thanks to the ever decreasing quality of the sequels to the original.This isn't really a sequel to the Nightmare series, it really is a stand alone film, and it it seems that this was a starting point for Cravens excellent 'Scream' movie.It's surprisingly not very scary, but can be very tense at times, and the most disturbing thing about this film is Miko Hughes' character and the obvious connotations to him, Freddy, and the origins of his character (he abused young children after all).The novelty of actors playing themselves was quite a novelty 15 years ago, with Last action Hero, only really being a big profile film to feature actors playing themselves (yes there are others, but none so prolific as a summer blockbuster, and a very famous horror franchise).All the actors can 'play' themselves really god, which must have been hard to an extent.The ending is a little disappointing, but it resurrects Freddy into a an evil entity once more, rather than the comic book anti-hero he became in the turgid sequels.",New Nightmare
21,movieman_kev,"A valiant effort, but too late to salvage Freddy",7,10 October 2005,"The last true ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" film has Wes Craven directing a new Nightmare film wherein he kills Krueger for good. Freddy doesn't like this and decides to stalk the cast and crew. Departing from the out and out humor that the series was hopelessly embedded in, while a good idea, at this point the franchise was way too mired in sub-mediorocity to ever be completely salvaged again. Freddy was seen as a clown for too long to hope that could change with just one film, no matter how noble the intentions might have been. The films nicely acted and pretty tightly plotted, it just seemed to be too little too late.My Grade: C+ DVD Extras: Commentary by Wes Craven; Cast and Crew Bios; and Jump to a Nightmare option (more extras for the film can be found on the seventh disc of The Nightmare Collection DVD set) DVD-Rom content: Trivia game; Screenplay; and web link",New Nightmare

This Freddy doesn't joke around and looks far more threatening than in the previous installments.  Everything about this movie should have been cool, but I just found it to be disappointing.  It definitely has its moments though; it is just too bad that for the most part it is rather slow.  At one point in the movie I began to wonder if Freddy was even in the movie, and there are not a lot of deaths in this one either.

24,StevePulaski,The rare case where changing ways late in the game actually works,8,21 October 2014,"Wes Craven's New Nightmare comes as the sixth sequel to the long-running Nightmare on Elm Street franchise but finds itself more functional and ambitious than many franchises that have made it this long do. Infused with a great deal of meta-writing to the point of intrigue, crafty ideas about the effects horror films have on those who make them, and darker, more terrifying portrayals of the film's beloved dream-haunter, New Nightmare revives the franchise that, according to Craven, was beginning to get too off-task with its practices.By this point, Craven had already expressed frustration over the fact that the character of Freddy Krueger had become far too comical, and the later films were written with far too much silliness, masking the true horror and fright he originally conceived for the series. Freddy had become ""cartoonish"" and lost his original abilities to frighten audiences as much as taunt them with silly phrases and ubiquity in pop culture. As a result, Craven created New Nightmare to give that life back to the franchise, and he did so in a way that explored a fascination with the concept of ""metafilm,"" or a movie that is referencing beyond the film into the real lives of the actors or to some other, unrelated film universe, as if the characters are wiser beyond their own definitive world.This fascination with ""metafilm"" Craven began to toy with would only get further explored in his critically/financially-successful Scream franchise, which was brewed two years after New Nightmare. For now, however, Nightmare concerns itself with Heather Langenkamp, the actress who portrayed Nancy Thompson in the original Nightmare film, as she lives with her husband, who works in special effects, and young son in Los Angeles. Heather has gone onto receive a great deal of recognition for her as Nancy, and learns that Wes Craven is contemplating using her again for his forthcoming Nightmare project, which will further which will, of course, have Robert Englund reprising his role as Freddy Kruger.In the mix of this, Heather begins experiencing lucid nightmares of her or her family being attacked and assaulted by Freddy and taken as ""his children,"" completely losing sense of reality. This is only furthered by the abundance of earthquakes Los Angeles is experiencing, as well as the constant stress she's under with managing her child and her other projects.Craven decorates New Nightmare much differently than the previous installments, most notably through the abundance of different costumes Freddy boasts, with one of the most stylish and menacing being a black and blue cloak. In addition, Englund is much less concerned with sloganeering and finding just the right punchline for his character Freddy than returning to the haunting and demonic presence Freddy can truly be. The idea of a figure haunting our dreams and finding ways of sneaking into our reality, distorting it, and leaving it at his mercy is a wickedly frightening idea, and Craven returns to the elements of exploring that idea rather than turning it into black comedy.New Nightmare can be quite eerie at times, but it also has a pleasantly subtle sense of sass to it, especially when Craven comes on-screen, or when one of Heather's costars tries to but in and help her out. This is where the Scream foundation ostensibly came into play, with Craven experimenting with self-referential humor in such a way that makes the film more interesting and not entirely consumed in its own cheeky ways. Combining these elements, especially in a way meant to evoke humor and make fans of a franchise recall moments from films past, could easily destruct in a big way, but Craven is so smooth with the incorporation of the aforementioned elements that we get the idea he had this idea festering in his mind long before he put the pen to the paper.Because evident care and thought went into Wes Craven's New Nightmare is likely why it plays like a unique horror film, quietly proposing ideas about those who work in the film industry, specifically making horror films, and what effect such work has on their psyche and their own personal lives. The tone is much more frightening, and given the seriousness and ambition Craven has for the material, the film feels much more sincere in ways the abundance of Nightmare sequels lacked, leaving this to be one of the most unlikely contenders for one of the strongest sequels to a horror film, especially trying something new this late in the game.Starring: Heather Langenkamp, Robert Englund, John Saxon, and Miko Hughes.

25,Smells_Like_Cheese,The best of the series,8,11 November 2003,"New Nightmare, the seventh and final installment in the Nightmare on Elm Street series. I was lucky enough to get the Nightmare on Elm Street series in the box DVD set and I finished all the sequels. I would say that without a doubt that this was the best sequel in the series. I was amazed at how clever the story was and I think the reason why is because of the fact that Wes Craven is back with this story. I was a little depressed that at least Johnny Depp wasn't really in it, that would've been a cool experience, but that doesn't kill the story. Instead the film has taken on a new and hip twist onto the series. Wes has taken the story and turned it around on the characters, instead of having Heather as Nancy, she's playing herself, just as is the rest of the cast, only now they're in trouble with Freddy.Heather Langenkamp is a huge star in the horror movie world, but she's now a happily married woman with her son, Dillain. But she's receiving death threats from a fan who strangely sounds a lot like Freddy. Soon strange things start happening, her husband is killed tragically in a car accident that seems like the act of Freddy, and her son is now not sleeping. She wonders if it's because of her movies or is it possible that Freddy is real and he wants her? She may have to go back to her roots to save her son.New Nightmare is incredibly clever and was just all in all a great idea. I really enjoyed this sequel, it's a definite keeper and a watch for the Nightmare on Elm Street fans. Freddy is back and he's more mean than ever; it was so cool that the took Heather Langenkamp and put her in the same situation as her character, Nancy. It just shows that Wes hasn't lost his touch with the Nightmare on Elm Street series. If you love horror films in general, I highly recommend New Nightmare, this is an awesome film.8/10",New Nightmare
26,MovieAddict2016,"The best ""Nightmare"" movie - funny, scary, clever and fresh",7,29 October 2005,"Wes Craven was most popular for creating the self-referential subgenre of horror movies with ""Scream"" in 1996, but it was actually two years prior - with ""New Nightmare"" - that he first played around with the concept. This semi-sequel to the popular ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" series (begun in 1984) takes place in the real world, and revolves around actress Heather Langenkamp and her fame after the success of the films.However, ten years after the original, a stalker has started to leave her menacing phone calls mimicking the voice of Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund), the infamous character who - in the film series itself - is the dead pedophile who lives in children's dreams and kills them in their sleep.Freddy was killed off in the last ""Nightmare"" movie and now he's crossing over into the real world to seek revenge. He kills Heather's husband and begins to go after her son, Dylan (Miko Hughes), who is plagued by terrifying nightmares.Meanwhile, Robert Englund suffers similar scares and begins to have odd visions involving his character Freddy.""New Nightmare"" is a very clever film, but it's not perfect. In terms of scares, it is far more polished than the original - a larger budget, better makeup, and generally just more professional. The scary moments are more tense and frightening.But there are some lapses in logic. Heather's husband dies and she doesn't seem to care very much (this may have to do with the fact that she's simply a bad actress to begin with, but it also just might be a bad script). She visits the morgue and leaves her son at home in the middle of the morning - presumably without a babysitter. A bit of an odd thing to do after having obsessed about making sure he wasn't alone at any given time due to his Freddy visions.Similar inconsistencies occur throughout the film, but in my opinion, it's about on par with the original ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" and probably - at least from a technical perspective - the best of the bunch. I generally enjoy clever, self-referential films and that's just an added bonus here - I'd call this the most original and witty entry in the series, by far.",New Nightmare
27,Rainey-Dawn,A Few Vibes Of The Original Film,4,18 January 2017,"Heather Langenkamp is back playing this time herself. She finds that Freddy is real - quite real and was not just a movie she made a few years back. Now can she play the role of Nancy Thompson again to save her son and herself? Well, it does have a few vibes of the original film only because Heather Langenkamp is back in it. But the story is not all that grand to me. This film undermines the original film because Heather Langenkamp is back but play herself, Heather Langenkamp and not as Nancy Thompson. Basically this film says that the original film never did happen, in fact it says that NONE of the sequels happened either. This film just blows the entire franchise or ""Elm Street Universe"" out of the water. If Heather was back playing the actual role of Nancy again and not herself then I would have liked this film better.It's just OK.4/10",New Nightmare
28,thesar-2,"New, Fresh and Great Nightmare",9,28 February 2010,"Though the nightmares continue (SEE: 2003's Freddy Vs. Jason, 2010's A Nightmare on Elm Street), Wes Craven's New Nightmare was the perfect conclusion to the older series, much like Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country.Wildly original – before this movie was released, I had never seen such an original idea as this, especially in a horror series seven deep. In fact, though #4 remains my favorite of the series, this is certainly the most original since #1. You have to give Craven some kudos here; he's hit & miss, though mostly hit. And for him to return to his groundbreaking and innovative horror series for a part SEVEN, it takes balls.How's this for an idea for a movie: Let's acknowledge that there is, in fact, a horror movie called A Nightmare on Elm Street starring Heather Langenkamp, Robert Englund and John Saxon, and that script idea was based on the director/creator Wes Craven's own real nightmares. Let's put these people in a film about that film and have them play themselves. Then, let's fast forward through 5 sequels and when the series is pretty much dead (no pun on the title of #6: Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare as it wasn't just the title that did it in, it was the extremely poor quality) until...Craven begins to have nightmares once again.Apparently he needs Heather's help in finishing off the story, once again. Heather Langenkamp's comfortable in her life: she loves her husband, son and hates violence. She's shy when it comes to the fame caused by Nightmare's #1 and #3 (which is the exact opposite for actor Robert Englund, apparently.) But, things have been a little shaky lately, beyond the obvious reasons: recent earthquakes.She's been having nightmares and her child, too. Make that everyone involved in the films have. But, things are coming true, like in the films she was in. And she's getting crank Freddy calls, annoying letters and her TV will not shut off, even with the power cord unplugged. In short, she's practically falling apart. It doesn't help that her boy likes to scream his head off every 4-5 shots of the film. (Actually, that can make any viewer, like me, crazy.) Heather must attempt to solve this mystery, and quickly as not only does the body count stack up, but people start to think she's crazy for thinking Freddy is really behind all the killings.Though the movie has its flaws (already mentioned one – that kid WAS ANNOYING and there were some implausible and inconsistencies in the plot) and it wasn't perfect by any means, but I really, really liked and admired this film, even beyond being a self-described Freddy Fan.I love the people playing themselves, especially Langenkamp, Englund, Saxon, Craven and Shaye. Heather Langenkamp finally acts – as much as I liked her in #1 and #3, her acting was kind of, well, weak. Here, despite her playing herself, she's natural on screen, believable, credible and someone to root for. As was Robert Englund – it was nice seeing how friendly he is, and a real person beyond the makeup. I've always been a fan of John Saxon, and again, it's great seeing him normal and keeping up a friendship with his on-screen daughter played by Langenkamp. And though Craven and Shaye are barely in it, I still liked their performances as well. (Honorable mentions, and as a said-Freddy Fan, including looking through the funeral crowd to find some of my favorite former stars of the series, including Tuesday Knight. Yes, I'm aware Depp wasn't there, but he did want to be, so that counts.) Also, keeping up with the New Nightmare plot line, Freddy (or the entity now known as ""Freddy"" – watch the movie to find out why) finally gets evil. (I'm sure the 2010 remake/reboot will contain the ultimate evil Freddy, but, to date, we haven't gotten that far.) He looks darker, acts more wicked and is more restrained in his comments – and you can tell, when he does say something, it's for his own amusement, not for the audience's for once. This is good writing here. Actually, I felt the entire movie was great writing and contained great homage to Craven's original – SEE: her hair and the gory scene between the babysitter and Heather's son.I don't judge a movie based on box office receipts, but I was saddened to see this one fail so miserably. Perhaps people just gave up on Freddy after #6 was so horrible. (#5 didn't do well either at the box office, so I guess it was inevitable.) But this movie sincerely made up for #5-6, much like what Halloween: H20 (part 7) did for the terrible string of sequels leading up to the worst Halloween sequel, #6.And finally, (spoiler, as if a lot of this hasn't been so far) since it's not really Freddy, I love the fact New Line kept to their word – Freddy Krueger really did die in #6: Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare (hence the title) and Paramount did the same thing (Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter was the final as part 5 of the Jason Voorhees series was a different killer.) Of course, that argument's out the window with both Freddy Vs. Jason and Friday the 13th part VI: Jason Lives. Granted, in reality, I am only talking about Wes Craven's New Nightmare in 1994. It would be years until Freddy returned for Freddy Vs. Jason. (Wow, that was a mouthful, but hopefully I got my point across.) 1984's A Nightmare on Elm Street had a great premise and an original story. Wes Craven's New Nightmare took that five steps ahead. And that's a rarity in any genre. Highly recommended.",New Nightmare
29,Robert_duder,It takes a master to re-birth a tired franchise,8,11 January 2012,"None of the Nightmare On Elm Street sequels were straight-up 'bad' per se. But the series has definitely hit an all time lull with Freddy's Dead. Could anyone breath new life into it? Probably not, other than the creator and horror master himself. Wes Craven comes up with one of the coolest, most unique ideas in a horror franchise. He breaks down the fourth wall and lets Freddy Kreuger into the real real world and brings back some of the iconic original characters.Heather Langenkamp returns as herself who is contemplating returning the Nightmare series as Nancy. Its great to have her back and she brings a certain memorable class to the film. The very talented youngster Miko Hughes (he was stunning in Mercury Rising) plays Heather's young son Dylan. He does a great job! John Saxon also returns playing himself this time around and its good to see him back as he does a great job too. Even Wes Craven plays double duty as himself and it was really cool to have him on the cast. David Newsom is decent as Langenkamp's husband although his role is quite small they have good chemistry. Robert Englund is the star of this movie. That might seem like an obvious statement but he is absolutely phenomenal in New Nightmare playing himself but also the return to the dark twisted killer that is Freddy Kreuger. Englund is a talented actor who has been type casted into horror flicks but this proved he can be versatile and really work with a great script. Its also proof that it was the lack of really depthy scripts that changed Kreuger into a comedic character because he slips back into the dark version of Kreuger flawlessly. It was so much fun to see Englund and Langenkamp together out of character and playing themselves.Ultimately you could watch the first Nightmare On Elm Street movie and then watch this one and not miss anything. This is a direct follow up to Wes Craven's original film and it is a brilliant addition to the series and the perfect way to usher in the tenth anniversary at the time. Generally this is considered by fans to be a great re-birth in the series and rightfully so. This one proves why horror fans like me keep coming back for more because sometimes even upper instalments can surprise you!! 8/10",New Nightmare
30,bowmanblue,The 'post modern' Freddy film,7,25 June 2014,"Believe it or not, I actually enjoyed ALL six of the previous Nightmare on Elm Street films. A lot of people went off them as they progressed, many feeling that Freddy was getting too comical and just not scary any more. Personally, I didn't mind his more 'humorous' persona, but I think I was slowly becoming the minority.Here, in what we might as well call 'Part 7,' the man who originally created Freddy (Wes Craven) returns to the helm one last time. Now Freddy is trying to break out of the movies and into real life to stalk and kill yet more victims. And, despite the formula being similar, i.e. if you fall asleep then Freddy will get you, the major change is that Freddy is now back to his 'evil only' roots. Gone is the humour and the one-liners and, in its place, pure nastiness. Also, Freddy's 'look' has slightly changed. They've redone his make-up which you may or may not appreciate.What you have here is a 'Freddy film' which is more akin to the original Nightmare on Elm Street than its successors. The first half seems to meander a little, but it's worth sticking with it, as the second half picks up the pace.If you're a fan of Freddy, whether you like him pure evil or comic evil, then you should enjoy this one. It may be a little pretentious in places when it tries to mess with your mind as it mixes 'real life' with the original Elm Street mythology, but it's still good fun. My only real gripe was the child actor who is one of the main characters. I know children can be touch and go when it comes to their acting abilities, but this one really doesn't cut it when he needs to. Minor gripe though – still a lot of fun.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",New Nightmare
31,ericstevenson,I've now seen all Nightmare On Elm Street movies!,8,23 October 2017,"This film is notable for being the longest slasher movie ever made. Well, I believe there's a cut of a ""Halloween"" movie that's longer, but this is the longest I've seen. This ended up being one of the best in the series. I admit it wasn't anything like I thought it would be. The other actors besides Heather Langenkamp don't really have much of a role. It's still a good movie as it manages to be creative. I especially like when they're talking about how Freddy died in the last movie, yet they want to make another one. They did. It's the movie we just saw!This movie doesn't exactly featured Freddy escaping into the real world as it's technically a demon that takes on his persona that appears. Its true form is unknown. Honestly, it probably would have worked just as well if it was the real Freddy that escaped into the real world. The pacing in the film is quite impressive and I really was rooting for a happy ending. It's a nice little meta film and it's actually done pretty realistically. Nice film for the series' ten anniversary celebration. ***",New Nightmare
32,jack_o_hasanov_imdb,Wait What ? ? ?,6,28 August 2021,It's not one of the worst in the series. But it was different. Freddy is always fun to watch. But I do not know. Was this a good idea?,New Nightmare
33,Bored_Dragon,I watched it with the lights on,7,17 October 2018,"The seventh and last part of ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" brings the most original plot twist in the franchise. While its prequels have a dream-like atmosphere, this one is much more realistic. On the tenth anniversary of the first film team responsible for its development begins to suffer from intense nightmares and freak accidents happen, and then they realize that Freddy, because he was terminated in the film franchise, has decided to switch to the real world. The credibility of the story is intensified by the fact that the original crew actually appears in the movie, so we have Heather Langenkamp in the role of Heather Langenkamp, Wes Craven in the role of Wes Craven, and so on. An interesting detail is that end credits list Freddy Krueger in the role of Freddy Krueger. I think the effect would be even stronger if the film was made in the form of a fake documentary, but this would prevent many of the things fans expect from a Freddy Krueger film. Although not the best movie in the franchise, it certainly is scariest, because it quite convincingly shifts its horrifying premise into ""our"" reality. If I saw it as a child I would probably be traumatized.7,5/10",New Nightmare
34,ironhorse_iv,Wes Craven's dream of rebooting Freddy becomes a New Nightmare,7,23 January 2013,"It's hardly a perfect film for Wes Craven, but it's eerie and thought-provoking, something that been lacking in the previous movies that made Freddy Kruger into a goofy wise cracker and cheesy death scenes. It is also the last the last time that Freddy showed any real menace. Wes Craven made this to take back control of his creation and it works as a criticism of what the franchise became with Freddy as a comedian, not to mention a rebuff to the tired argument about violence in films always causing it in the real world. Freddy was far more straightforward with his kills and didn't manifest elaborate scenarios for each death. Pure intimidation. That's what Wes was trying to bring back. New Nightmare is almost in it's own league. New Nightmare had a great story and very original, creative ideas in it but it was still a bit confusing with the plot of the movie! It's the movie without a movie. He would work this angle again, in the 'Scream' series with the ""Stab"" movies in Scream are movies within a movie! It's work here, it doesn't work there. 'A Nightmare on Elm Street 7: The Ascension' is being film, and Heather Langenkamp playing herself, the actress that play the original heroic star of the original movie is being ask to reprise her role as Nancy Thompson. She notice that her husband Chase, and son Dylan is also being haunted by Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund) outside the filming, and confront the actor Robert Englund about it. She then go to Wes Craven himself, who reveals that Freddy is real, and only she can stop him. There is a interesting theory that comes to front with this. It's probably not Wes Craven's intent, but an audience's interpretation is authorial fallacy to see that there might have been a connection to this movie with that of the 3rd movie Dream Warriors. Heather's character Nancy Thompson's dies in the World of the first three films/four films. Her funeral/gravestone proves this (the gravestone was shown in A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master). The character Kristen from Dream Warrior, somehow, created a new world/new reality and placed Nancy's soul into this world in the end of the film like it stated. It's a dream world, yet Nancy's soul can live a full beautiful life in this beautiful dream world. Nancy's physically dead, yet not spiritually dead. I would think that once she ages and dies in this dream world then she would have truly died. Overall, Nancy has been placed in a matrix type reality so, to her, everyone in this reality is real/important to her. Freddy though, once all event's take place in the ""real world"" (the world of dream warriors), realizes that Nancy is in this dream world/alternate reality and therefore tries to kill Nancy since he wants to finish her off once and for all. It must take a lot for him to enter this dream world though since earthquakes are occurring constantly. Since Wes Craven wrote 1, 3, and this one... could it be Nancy living as Heather. It's a headache, but it's worth checking out or is the previous films fake and this movie real. Is Heather insane or is Freddy really coming out of the film to kill the actress that kill him in the movie? The movie goes with the realish look to it. Surprising the earthquake footage in the film is real. It was taken from the 1994 Northridge earthquake that happen during filming. The movie seem fresh, and the way in which Freddy talked, walked, and looked really brought a much needed shot of freshness to the character that had seriously been lacking. Freddy has a deeper voice. To correspond with this, the make-up and outfit of the character was different, with one of the most prominent differences being that he now wears a long, black trench coat. In addition, the signature glove was redesigned for a more organic look, with the fingers resembling bones and having muscle textures in between. It really adds to his darker vibe. The problem with the movie was that Freddy was way too soft. He looked better than ever and he was darker than ever, but all he did to the kid and his mom was chase them around, wrestle them, and scare them. Also Freddie's screen time is almost non existent, he rarely in the film, but when he is, he's scary! Heather Langenkamp takes most of the movie time, sadly not great in leading the film anywhere, as she unable to act her way through wet tissue. Even with fails, Wes Craven's New Nightmare was probably created solely for the purpose of Wes wanting to erase 2, 4, 5, and 6, and I believe even 3 because he said in the special documentary for the box set that he essentially believes that only the first film and A New Nightmare are cannon. Essentially Wes Craven threw a bratty fit over the fact there were so many sequels and wanted to basically bury the series with A New Nightmare. The meta-fictional methodology of 'New Nightmare' really gave a unique and terrifying storyline and, in my opinion, one of the best films of the franchise. So while the theory is still interesting and I can see how it would work, I think it takes away from how good 'New Nightmare' is. I'd rather watch this one than a complete hideous garbage 2010 one with Haley is, God I dislike that version.",New Nightmare

This is one of the scariest movies ever. This movie has a great story line. This movie also has great acting. This movie also has special great effects. Freddy is a ghost so I consider this horror fantasy. This is one of the best horror movies ever made. This is a great movie. See this movie. This movie is a must sees. This movie is very intense. I need more lines and I am running out of things to say. This movie Freddy is trying to get into a parallel dimension were is world is a work of fiction. Great movie great movie. See it.

37,Dr_Coulardeau,The concluding episode to the opening master,10,14 February 2007,"It's not enough to bring Freddy Krueger back to life one more time after his official death. But Wes Craven has to come back too with the original characters, Nancy and her stubborn cop of a father. But we cannot really revive characters in a film so many years after their first appearance. So Wes Craven pushes what he calls « only make believe » one iota further and farther. Freddy was only a disguise for a real bad spirit in the world (Anne Rice has done that with her vampires and the Queen of the Damned, or Stephen King has also used this formula with his Dark Man in quite a few novels, like The Stand, and short stories) and this really bad spirit has decided to come back to the real world once and for all and under his own identity if possible, or under that of Freddy Krueger if the minds of people are obsessed by his existence. This evil spirit is of course the devil himself and it will be revealed in the very last scene. So the actors are playing their real parts and Freddy is invading their real world. It is then « make believe power two ». And it is all the more efficacious and effective because the actors are themselves and no fake identities. Wes Craven brings along his particularly caustic mind and spirit and really gets the mickey out of medical authorities, doctors, women and blacks alike, and all the fake myth about the protection of kids first and for all against their own parents. Wes Craven definitely seems to accuse society to be the real culprit, the real cause of all problems with kids, and grown-ups too. This society that classifies everyone in one little box and that can put a six year old boy in the schizophrenia box without realizing that it is going to make him schizophrenic. The classification creates the items that are classified in it. Any taxonomy is our own creation, our own delusion and we must get rid of all these taxonomies to maybe recapture some sanity and balance. But since Wes Craven is back do not be surprised if you recognize some tricks like the crazy phone calls borrowed from Scream and so many other films (it always works anyway). That's part of the game. Wes Craven borrows from everyone, himself included, and just shakes the cocktail differently and changes dressings. The sauce always becomes slightly more piquant when it is served a second time by our waiter Wes Craven. He even visualizes the first destruction of Freddy, the lynching of this child molester who attacks males first to kill them, and women second to enjoy their slow suffering and their yelling. So Freddy Krueger is roasted to death a second time, and it is when his face becomes the horny  ah ah funny !  head of the devil. Can we hope the saga is really finished now ? Probably not. There must be some forgotten sequel somewhere, though seven is a magical number and the point has been made that it is not movies that make children epileptic but all the Freddy Kruegers, Tommyknockers, Candymen, and other boogy woogy bogeymen overfed on beetle juice instead of milk, kept in the cupboards of our minds.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne",New Nightmare
38,filipemanuelneto,The last nightmare.,5,8 May 2021,"In this film, Freddy Krueger will haunt the nightmares of the actress Heather Langenkamp who, ten years earlier, gave life to the heroine of the first film in the franchise, and who this time comes back to play herself. The script is constructed as if Krueger were real and were, in fact, haunting the film's production, which is undoubtedly an original variation of what we already know.This is the last film in the classic franchise ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"", one of the most successful horror slasher films. The films before this one already revealed the wear of conventional formulas and everything indicated that no more films would be made to continue the franchise. However, the creativity of Wes Craven (who also signs other films of the genre, such as ""Scream"") managed to make this film revive the public's interest in this material a little. However, it is a film that wears out as it passes, and the ending is somewhat disappointing.Wes Craven is creative and can imagine good stories, but he was never the ideal director to demand the most from the cast. Heather Langenkamp interprets herself, but the truth is that one can hardly consider her dramatic interpretation to be really good. The actress just didn't seem to be engaged. For the last time, Robert Englund brings the character that immortalized him to the big screen, and does a competent job, even though I feel that the actor's work has been considerably better in previous films.Technically, the film seems to be expensive and has more money involved than the previous ones in the franchise. Cinematography is standard and does not present anything truly remarkable. Englund's makeup work doesn't look as interesting and authentic as it did in other films, but it does its job competently. The sets and costumes are good, and there is a touch of originality that is felt slightly in the visual and special effects, as well as in the dynamics of the film, which was very well edited.",New Nightmare

However, there is a difference between gore and suspense. Alfred Hitchcock was the master of suspense. He could do more in one scene with out showing any violence or blood than any of these movies could ever poop out. This is not in any way a scary or suspenseful movie. It is gore. Period.There is no imagination left to the movie. The key to making a good scary movie is to let the viewer form their images in their own mind. Then they scare their selves. The best way to ruin a movie is to show too much. That's the problem with this movie. It shows everything. Who cares? Idiots. People who only want to see blood and guts.

41,Fella_shibby,Ridiculous n tedious screenplay. The comedic Freddy was unique and they messed it up by making him into a menacing n serious one.,5,7 September 2020,"I first saw this in the mid 90s on a rented vhs.
Revisited it recently on a dvd which I own.
I didnt like the film then n even now.
The events of all the previous 6 installments r considered as a work of fiction n a new ridiculous screenplay and that too a very lengthy one is churned out.
The runtime is almost 120 mins n the only major thing shown is a child at peril.
Child at peril gets heavy for me. Two things i cant stand even in movies r violence towards children n rape.
The last 30 mins wher Freddy is transformed into a menacing n evil entity rather than a comedic one is noteworthy. Honestly, i enjoyed the comedic one more.
Ther r two very tension filled scenes, the park one where the kid is trying to jump n the highway one where the kid crosses the road.
All in all a lousy attempt with a ridiculous plot n terrible editing.
The remake proved that the non comedic Freddy doesnt work.",New Nightmare

Leaving behind the obnoxiously cartoonish tendencies of the sequels, it gets back to the existential fear of the first. The jump in technical quality is astounding; reminds you of what the difference between a mediocre and a great director looks like.

43,insomniac_rod,Forget about the 80's Krueger. This one takes the character seriously.,7,2 April 2006,"The best thing about ""New Nightmare"" is it's plot because it's a 180ª change in the Nightmare series. Putting Freddy Krueger on the real world was an idea that most Horror fans accepted because the genre seemed to be dead in the mid 90's.Other thing that fans of the genre and especially fans of the series praised was the inclusion of favorite characters. Nancy and her father Lt. Thompson return to put an end to Freddy for once and all. Heather L. delivers a great performance and seemed to really love her character and the series in general. John Saxon is great as always. Both characters add a nostalgic touch to the series. The rest of the cast is okay. Heather's son delivers a good performance and became quickly a favorite.Although Krueger has minimal on-screen time, it's justified by the plot and it surely works. Freddy Krueger used to be scary and menacing and in this final movie he returns to his roots. Great performance by Robert Englund.The ending is decent and is somehow a good way to end Freddy's reign of terror. He goes through the same fatal fate as when he was alive.I recommend this movie if you like to watch something different; the plot is something you haven't seen in any other slasher flick because it's taken seriously. If you give the movie a try you will be pleased.",New Nightmare
44,Anonymous_Maxine,The best reason for a sequel so far,9,7 December 2004,"One of my biggest pet peeves (besides that phrase) is when sequels come out and do nothing but plod through the same crappy plots as their predecessors or simply cash in on the success of an earlier film. Wes Craven's New Nightmare is a complete overhaul of the Nightmare on Elm Street formula, transferring it from the fictional Elm Street and into the real world. It would seem like a cheesy premise, Freddy is such a bad guy that he's even coming to life on the movie sets, but the idea makes it work.Wes Craven has been having nightmares again, and since his nightmares tend to be where he gets his best ideas (much like many other horror writers, directors, etc, not the least of which is Stephen King), he decides that this must mean it's time to make another Elm Street movie. Heather Langenkamp, who played the terrorized Nancy Thompson in Nightmares 1 and 3, takes on the role of herself. She's now 30 years old and has a child, but is gradually coming to realize that the strange things that have been happening and nightmares of Freddy that she has been having are way too similar to what happened in her movies, and she gradually comes to realize that it's all real. Some of the best moments are when she goes to talk to Wes Craven about it, to tell her what has been happening, and it is all stuff that he has already written into his new but unfinished script.Craven explains that the evil inside Freddy Kruger is actually an ancient evil that has merely been temporarily trapped inside the character of Freddy and the stories of the Nightmare on Elm Street movies, that as long as the story is kept active, the evil can be contained. Now that the movies have ended, he explains, the evil force within Freddy has been set free. There's a great scene where he tells Heather that the reason the story has died is because that's what happens when people water it down to make it an easier sell. This is a strikingly insightful comment to be made within a horror film, but it strikes me as strange since it's so obvious that he's referring to the load of bad sequels in the Nightmare on Elm Street series, only two of which he directed (the original and this one) but almost all of which he either produced or wrote. So anyway, Freddy has managed to separate himself from both Robert Englund, the actor that played him in the movies, and the Nightmare movies as well, and have entered our world. This is a hell of a lot better than Freddy Takes Manhattan!The movie takes place in an interesting parallel reality, it's not the reality in the movies and it's not the real world, but somewhere in between. All of the actors from the movies all play themselves and there is much talk of 'our world' and 'the real world,' but only the actors from previous movies play themselves, all the other people in the movie are characters played by actors, not the least of which is Heather's son, Dylan, who turns out to be the most powerful person in the movie. Dylan starts having nightmares and reacts as any kid his age would, not wanting to go to sleep and wanting mom to spend the night with him. Why she refuses for most of the movie is never really explains. She of all people must understand what he's going through!Ultimately, Freddy is able to come through and kill people when Dylan sleeps, and it seems that Freddy capitalizes on this, using the kid both as leverage and as a means to get into his world. There is a scene where Dylan runs across a freeway at night during heavy traffic, and Freddy appears in the sky and lifts him up, helping him across the freeway unharmed. This leaves the question of whether Freddy did this to protect his path into this world or just to taunt his mother, Heather, who is following closely behind and ready to run into traffic herself to save her son.(spoilers) There is also an homage scene involving Dylan's surprisingly dedicated babysitter in the hospital, she tries to prevent the nurses from putting him to sleep and ends up in a scene reminiscent of a classic scene from the first film. One of my favorite parts of the movie is how the actors near the end of the film relapse back into their roles, doing things like dressing as their characters and calling Heather Nancy and things like that, further blurring the line between the fiction from the previous films, our reality, and the reality presented in the movie. This is great stuff, but the movie really starts to slip near the end.Needless to say, there is a climactic scene in a horrific dungeon setting, with Heather and Dylan trying to escape and kill Freddy at the same time. Freddy gets his tongue forked, an interesting scene at a time when tongue piercings were simply the cool things to have, but then what? Freddy gets killed by fire? That's it?? Has Wes Craven ever seen a horror movie? Fire never kills the slashers! And to make matters worse, after Heather and Dylan finally 'kill' Freddy, we fast forward a bit and they're at home and Heather gets a copy of the script from Craven, and what does she do? She picks it up and starts reading it to Dylan! Is she MAD??? I think that New Nightmare stands as one of the best of the entire series, along with the original film, and despite these weak shortcomings, it is a tremendously well-made horror movie. It's thought out where most horror films aren't, it has a premise that's fascinating in the same way that things like time travel are fascinating, and it will surely please Nightmare fans eager to get a look at the Nightmare on Elm Street sets as well as the cavernous mansion that Craven has managed to afford from being royalty in the horror movie production world. I definitely recommend this one.",New Nightmare

46,FiendishDramaturgy,Breathing new life into a masterful creation,9,30 January 2005,"I was expecting very little in the way of this sequel. The others grew tired and lifeless, with on again, off again, decent performances turned in by Robert Englund as Freddy, and some decent, not so decent script writing. Frankly, you just never know what TO expect with long-running franchises such as this. But what I got was NOT what I expected. Nothing close.I had to view this three times. At my first viewing, I was so surprised, I immediately said, ""I need to watch this again."" Upon my third viewing, I realized that what I was watching was the resurrection of one of my favorite franchises! I was (if only momentarily) struck speechless. I'm trying not to ""gush"" here, or exaggerate, so do not take it lightly when I say that I believe this is possibly the most creative work Craven has ever directed. Don't get me wrong, aside from ""Last House on the Left,"" I've enjoyed everything Craven's put out, including those annoyingly clichéd ""Scream"" movies. (Just for your info though, I only didn't like Last House on the Left because I do not find entertainment in exploitation, it IS a fine low budget, independent exploitation film, just not my cup of tea.) But ""New Nightmare"" is just not a recycling of the same tired old story with a new kick. It's a new take on a long-standing favorite BY the creator.

I have just watched it for I believe the second time but on VHS and a 28"" TV, so to be fair it was never going to be the same. Whilst I still like the concept and let's be honest the comical Freddy of the previous few sequels had become tiresome New Nightmare just didn't grab me like I was hoping that it would, despite Freddy being played for scares this time. Heather Langenkamp didn't seem comfortable playing herself, not a good performance in my opinion, but John Saxon and Robert Englund as themselves were good. Wes Craven himself, cool seeing him as himself though he's obviously better behind the camera than he is in front of it. In some of the sequels we see too much of Freddy, here I think we don't see enough, the film takes a while to get going, it feels quite slow, the kill count is relatively low and just overall there is less horror. One of my favourite lines has Nancy say ""Every kid knows who Freddy is. He's like Santa Claus or King Kong!"" I can't argue with that. I had really been looking forward to revisiting this, part 7 in the franchise, but couldn't help but feel somewhat disappointed, though don't get me wrong it's still a solid watch.PS look out for scream queen Lin Shaye in a small role as a nurse.

48,kevin_robbins,This was a good spin on the series,7,30 July 2021,"Wes Craven's New Nightmare (1994) is available on HBOMAX and follows Nancy and the cast from Nightmare in Elm Street from the view and lifestyle of the cast. The actress who played Nancy starts seeing people around the cast dying by what appears to be Freddy from the movie. Can they get the sequel out fast enough to stop Freddy and will that stop him? This movie is directed by and stars Wes Craven (Night on Elm Street) and also stars Robert Englund (Hatchet), Heather Langenkamp (A Nightmare on Elm Street) and Robert Shaye (Freddy vs Jason). The storyline for this is delivered in a unique and entertaining fashion. The flashes in and out of reality in this are well executed. I'm not sure what was going on with Robert Englund in this - what was he wearing and doing in every scene, and why can't he act when playing himself? The execution of both Englund and Craven playing themselves was choppy and felt unnatural, definitely the worst scenes in the movie. I will say the kid in this was excellent, probably the best part of the film - that and the two tongue scenes, via the phone and ending. Overall this was a good spin on the series I'd score a 6.5/10.",New Nightmare

50,NateWatchesCoolMovies,Freddy gets a much needed rejuvenation,9,4 December 2016,"Sleek, frightening update on a sagging franchise. Brilliant use of a meta concept that could have easily taken the silly route. Imaginative, jaw dropping practical effects. A darker, less flamboyant take on the iconic character Freddy Krueger. Wes Craven's New Nightmare was the best Freddy flick to come along since Dream Warriors, the third installment. After the stale and awkward sixth film, Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare (my ass final), there really needed to be a game changer, something fresh and solid that would shake up a routine that had been getting fairly silly for some time. Who better to facilitate that than the man who kicked the entire legacy off back in 84′, Wes Craven himself? Back with a vengeance and a whole grab bag of new ideas, Crane brought forth a new, remodeled version of the Freddy lore, with some innovative twists. This one takes place in the real world, where Heather Langenkamp is Heather Langenkamp and not Nancy, Robert Englund is actually Englund and not Freddy. Heather has a young son (Miko Hughes, the go to little tyke of the 90's), Englund is relaxing and trying out the artist's life, and Craven, also playing himself, has big bold ideas for the Nightmare franchise. The meta doesn't stop there though; Whatever Craven is cooking up has somehow awoken a very real, very serious and very scary version of Freddy who is now trying to break free from dreams and into our world, using young Hughes as a conduit, and wreaking havoc left right and center. Heather knows the only way to put a stop to the evil is to face Freddy, as Nancy, one last epic time. I love the high concept, I love that Craven conceived of this and got it made, it's one of the most inventive horrors ofnthe decade. When Freddy does show up, he's dead straight serious without a quip or wisecrack in sight. His design and attitude are way darker too, he's a suitable real world dream demon that makes the Englund of past outings look like Big Bird. The special effects crafted for the netherworld Heather ventures into are a confusing labyrinth of body horror, ornate production design and impressive imagination. A complete vision of the Elm Street legacy that does what few horror franchises attempt, let alone succeed at: It reaches beyond the tropes that have got it to where it is and pleased audiences so far, breaks new ground and reinvents the legend.",New Nightmare
51,hu675,One of Craven's best work as a filmmaker.,8,31 January 2006,"When the star of the original ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" film, Heather Langenkamp is happily married to a special make-up effects man (David Newson) and their eight year old son (Miko Hughes). Actress Langenkamp gets a chance of a life-time to appear in a role that make her famous for horror fans everywhere to make a more realistic, intelligent, adult and scary different sequel to the Elm Street saga that made Freddy Krueger (Which is been always played by Robert Englund). Which is a household name for the then-independent studio ""New Line Cinema"". Which filmmaker:Wes Craven is actually writing the new script but in someways Freddy has become real in the dream world. Now Freddy is stalking his victims through their dreams, for those who are involved in this new production before Craven finish his script.Written and Directed by Wes Craven (The People Under the Stairs, The Serpent and the Rainbow, Shocker) made an excellent one of a kind sequel for those, who grown up watching the original. Langenkamp is actually very good in this film and Hughes as her son almost steals the film. This could have been great also, if this was about Robert Englund's dark side to Freddy. Still, Craven did some of his best work as a filmmaker (Which he received some of the best reviews of his career of this film).DVD has an sharp anamorphic widescreen (1.85:1) transfer (also in Pan & Scan) and an strong-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has an fascinating audio commentary by the director, original theatrical trailer, cast & crew information and jump to a nightmare opinion. On the ""Elm Street"" box set on the eighth disc. DVD has an interview with the filmmaker. Some of the amusing highlights of the film is people were involved with the series-including Co-Ceo & Co-Chairman:Robert Shaye and actor:John Saxon played themselves in cameos. Englund gives an different kind of performance as the new and improve ""Freddy Krueger"". The film didn't have much success at the box office. But the film went on to have an cult success on video.

53,aidanratesmovies,"Best Film since the original, if not, the best",9,25 June 2020,"A very bold and original retelling of the classic horror flick, New Nightmare does something that horror had previously not done before, and it's quite impressive to see how well it is done. The film is very cleverly written, and besides the beginning and merely okay conclusion, it is quite an interesting thriller. It's easily the scariest film of the bunch, most certainly the scariest sequel, and its new look and take on the character of Freddy Krueger is quite brilliant, and surprisingly well done. Craven had wanted Freddy to be a darker character in the sequels, so i'm glad that as a storyteller he got the justice his character deserved. Freddy's new look, and his performance by Englund is quite fantastic, as well as very refreshing from the constant stream of familiar tropes throughout the franchise. Craven breathes new life into the saga, which I honestly would have doubted and did doubt before watching this movie, expecting it to be okay at best. I'm glad my doubts were wrong. Besides Craven's directing style and the refreshing new take on Krueger, Heather Langenkamp also gives a surprisingly really good performance. She truly puts herself in the moment, having experienced stocker like situations which are demonstrated in the film in her own real life. I only acknowledge this because of how truly brave a task that is to do, to put yourself back in a situation you rather forget, and or don't feel very comfortable in, and she does a great job demonstrating that, and I can't help but feel inspired watching it. Besides the things I have already listed, the film is also shot very well, with some interesting cinematography this time around. As for the look of the film, besides the new look of Krueger, it isn't anything to really gush about, but I wouldn't expect much for this type of film anyway. As for my problems with the film, it does begin to start quite abruptly, and feels like it stumbles a bit while doing so. It felt as if Craven didn't quite know how to begin the tale, so he wrote two beginnings and tied them together, thus forming the dream like horrors in the film. Some of these scenes throughout the film can be frightening, but some do feel quite obvious, and kinda pointless. The ending of the film wasn't all that impressive to me, not that it was in any way very flawed, I just felt like it was kinda bland, which the film throughout did not demonstrate itself as one bit. In the end, New Nightmare was a surprisingly well done sequel and great return for Craven, Freddy, Langenkamp, and all the former people involved with the films. It may feel a bit uneven at times, but for the most part, it is a very solid entry, and a very unique horror flick which I wouldn't mind watching again somewhere down the line.My Rating: 8.7/10.",New Nightmare
54,Jonny_Numb,Freddy gets existential,6,11 November 2006,"The ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" phenomenon is something that has always eluded me; sure, the original film had some moments that scared me when I was in the ""under 10"" age bracket, but now seem rather tame. I never bothered watching the sequels, save for random moments I'd catch on cable, so I went into Wes Craven's ""New Nightmare"" with few expectations, and even fewer reservations. And I was quite pleasantly surprised by the end result. Like ""Halloween: H20,"" this is a film that all but ignores the sequels sandwiched between the original and itself, opting to bring the series to a respectable end. At the time of its release in 1994, ""New Nightmare""'s concept of reality overlapping with fantasy, and a self-referential attitude (the fictional Freddy has become such a pop-culture icon that he begins to manifest in the real world) was rather radical, and would be revisited by Craven in the ""Scream"" trilogy. Where ""New Nightmare"" diverges from those films is in its cleverly existential sub-layer; Craven, a former college professor, brings a refreshing intelligence to his dream-logic, instead of using it as a cheap plot device. By ""Saw"" and ""Hostel"" standards, the film is restrained in its bloodshed, instead looking to inspire chills through a sustained unpredictability that works extremely well. Craven represents his maternal side in Heather Langenkamp's concerned mother, and gets some good, cheeky performances from John Saxon and Robert Englund (as himself and Freddy).",New Nightmare

This is probably the best of ""Nightmare"" sequels; it's creepy, has great special effects, it's filled with nostalgia for the original, and it brought back many of the important original cast members from that first film, including Heather Langenkamp (""A Nightmare on Elm Street III: Dream Warriors""), John Saxon (""Enter the Dragon""), and of course Robert Englund (""A Nightmare on Elm Street V: The Dream Child"").

56,TheOneThatYouWanted,If it wasn't for that stupid mask..,7,15 May 2016,"You can definitely see how this film lead to Wes creating one of the best horror movies of all time, Scream. But this Nightmare on Elm street sequel could have been so much better if Freddy's mask didn't look like a cheap Halloween mask. If it was meant to look like that just to keep the meta about this film then it was a bad decision. It looks goofy as hell and takes you out of the movie. Regardless, it is better than 95% of the other Nightmare sequels so you'll just have to take what you get. The film is about the real life actress, and real life actors, producers and director of the Nightmare series, dealing with a Freddy Krueger who has crossed over into our world. The script is smart but the stupid Freddy mask, as well as a few other flaws makes this film an ugly duckling.",New Nightmare
57,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,A Weirdly Entertaining sort of Sequel,7,12 December 2020,"The 1980s was the decade of many things. For the film industry, more specifically the genre of horror, Freddy Krueger was one of the top icons. While he emerged almost half way through the decade, his name stuck and the fans couldn't get enough of the series. Of course that is until the character became campier and campier therefore viewers not taking him as seriously. It was also obvious to director Wes Craven after leaving the franchise from the first film that his creation wasn't the same several sequels down the road. It was because of this realization that Craven returned to helm this film. Although, what some people might be expecting is not what they should be expecting, if that makes any sense. This is exactly why the title is called Wes Craven's New Nightmare.The plot is one the most absurdly meta stories to a franchise. After taking part in A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) and A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors (1987), Heather Langenkamp is now married with a son Dylan (Miko Hughes). Producers from New Line Cinema want her to return for one more Elm Street sequel, but she's currently being stalked by someone imitating Freddy Krueger...or is it? Once people she knows starts showing up dead in familiar ways to that of the films, it's up to Langenkamp to stop the evil force. Written and directed by Wes Craven, this pseudo-sequel which in a way, rounds out the two trilogy of films rather well. What's crazy is just how self-aware the script is. There nods to how fans have seen the franchise through the years, how Freddy has been perceived and what parents have thought of the films.The script also has people who played characters in past films playing themselves this time. Rob LaBelle from Jack Frost (1997) has a small role as a special effects technician. Jsu Garcia who played Rod in the first film has a cameo, as well as Tuesday Knight from A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master (1988), John Saxon and Lin Shaye. It's just weird, but cool at the same time. This also seems to be the template for what Craven would use in Scream (1996) and maybe even Bride of Chucky (1998). All the actors entertain and are convincing in their roles as themselves and their characters of this movie of a movie within a movie. Also as a child actor, Miko Hughes is believable and would later have roles in Apollo 13 (1995), Mercury Rising (1998), Escape to Grizzly Mountain (2000) and Clockstoppers (2002).But of course, what would the film be without Robert Englund playing Fred Krueger? Well that's kind of the thing about this movie. First off, Englund not only plays himself, but also Krueger again. That's a plus. The problem is, Krueger doesn't seem to appear as much in the film as one would hope. There's a balance and sometimes less is more. However, even the very first film had more appearances that what seems to be this one. The same could be said for gore as well. This doesn't take away the performance or look of the new Krueger design though. The criticism of Krueger being too campy cannot be made here. He is very much what he was from early on; serious, dark and has just right number of one-liners. Kudos to Englund.The cinematography was shot well for this movie. Behind the camera was Mark Irwin, the same guy who worked on Scanners (1981), Videodrome (1983), The Fly (1986), The Blob (1988), RoboCop 2 (1990), Dark Angel (1990) and Showdown in Little Tokyo (1991). Probably the only weak visual component was CGI effects since it was the early 90s, which is forgivable to a degree and not much of it exists in the movie. Lastly the film score was composed by J. Peter Robinson, who during the same year scored Highlander: The Final Dimension (1994). Surprisingly, the music for this film pays respects to Charles Bernstein's original theme while incorporating some of his own style in various tracks. Thankfully there aren't too many stings if at all.As the seventh entry in the series, although it may not be considered depending on who you ask, this film is bizarrely clever in its execution paving the way for other self-aware horror films. The actors all put in good performances, the music and camerawork are all nicely done too. Only issue is, the main villain may not be as prevalent as some might hope him to be.",New Nightmare
58,PredragReviews,"""I guess evil never dies, right?""",8,6 August 2016,"After the dismal ""Freddy's Dead"", Freddy seemed to be dead and buried for at least a few years. It, however, was in 1994 that Wes Craven came up with the radical idea of bringing Freddy back for another nightmarea ""New Nightmare"". The plot is phenomenal! Wes puts (or is putting) an amazing nightmarish puzzle together. (Actually he already has put that puzzle together, but he let's the audience try to decipher that.) He mixes fantasy with reality; characters to actors and dreams (nightmares) that once realized are (or were) actual events. And even the nightmare sequences are puzzling. Also I reveled at the fact that the characters aren't who they are or.. I don't know! Even that was confusing! (Until I saw it again, of course!) But what I pondered more was that the last two or three scenes went ""backwards!"" though the film was progressing. It's like we went from Seven to One in twenty minutes at least in an attempt to put Freddy to rest..This film gets very confusing, and I found myself with my head in my hands throughout, trying to figure out what was happening. Wes Craven plays himself, as does Robert Englund. And according to the credits, Freddy Krueger plays Freddy Krueger. Right... There are quite a few actors who play themselves in this film, which I didn't realize, having not recognized anyone, including the lead actress. The soundtrack to this film is absolutely fantastic! I really enjoyed it, and it was noticeable throughout the film, which was actually a good thing. I recognized some of the music, although could not place it. Overall, this is one of the best Nightmare On Elm Street films ever made. I easily hold this in my top five!Overall rating: 8 out of 10.",New Nightmare
59,gangstahippie,Great sequel,9,2 August 2007,"Rated R for Violence/Gore and Language.The Nightmare On Elm Street series is one of my favorite horror film series.The films are fun mixing tons of gore with humor(except this and the first film which were fairly dark).There have been a total of seven films in the series(eight including Freddy Vs Jason).They are all good in my opinion.This sequel does not disappoint.For those who didn't like the comedy route the series was taking, this film goes back to pure horror and no comedy.Its directed by Wes Craven who directed the first film and has most of the original cast from the first film(except Johnny Depp who was by now a big star).This film takes place in the real world,Heather Lagenkamp, the woman who was in Nightmare On Elm STreet 1 or 3 returns and she plays herself.So do most of the cast members.Robert Englund plays both himself and Freddy Kruger.Basically the plot of this film is about there being a demon who represents Freddy Kruger.Angry that they killed of Freddy in the last film, he decides to get revenge on the actress Heather Lagenkamp who has a son named Dylan.Freddy Kruger looks much darker and different than in the previous films.New NIghtmare is a very entertaining film that is most like the original.",New Nightmare
60,slayrrr666,Better than the Original,10,10 February 2004,"""Wes Craven's New Nightmare"" is the only movie, other than the original, to make Freddy actually scary, and in just about every single case, is better than the original.**SPOILERS**Heather Langenkamp, (Heather Langenkamp), her husband, Chase Porter, (David Newsom) and her son Dylan (Miko Hughes) are trying to life their lives when it's interrupted by an earthquake, and parts of the house is damaged. Heather gets ready for a TV appearance to promote the new Freddy movie, and a special appearance by Robert Englund in Freddy make-up reawakens her fear of Freddy. That same day, her husband dies in a strange accident. At the funeral, she meets up with co-star John Saxon, (John Saxon), and experiences another weird vision. Starting to convince herself she is going crazy, she calls on Englund for advice, and it settles her down. The next day, Dylan nearly kills himself. He is taken to a hospital for tests, and needs to stay overnight. Heather pays a visit to Wes Craven, as himself, to talk about the script for the new Freddy movie, and learns that Wes has known all along of Dylan. During the night, there is another earthquake, and examining the wreckage finds Freddy back from the dead. After a small battle, an aftershock sends Freddy into hiding and Heather back to the hospital to check on Dylan. The search brings Heather back home, where she and Dylan have one last showdown with Freddy.The Good News: This film finally brings back respect and fear back for Freddy. After five sequels, this one goes back to the original idea of Freddy as a menacing killer. He has very little screen time, and even drops his whole wise-cracking act from the sequels. It was greatly appreciated to see, as it makes Freddy that much more vicious and scarier than the previous films. Most of the movie has the cast from the original playing themselves, and we get to see their lives off camera. All of the stars are real good friends, and it was nice to see the actors show up one last time. The shocks in this film is mostly Heather's dreams and day-mares of Freddy. The main one was the funeral hallucination. I won't reveal it, but it was very creepy and very well-thought-out. Most of them are just that: very well thought-out, creepy and certainly very creative. The gore is toned down from the others, but there is still some great blood-letting when it happens. The rare slash-marks that are there do let the blood fly, and the deaths are pretty graphic when they occur. It has a high watch-ability factor, and makes you want to watch it over and over again, something very few horror movies do, as you become emotionally attached to the characters. The ending is perhaps the best of the series, with such a large amount of special effects involved and a dark, twisted atmosphere. It's action-packed, doesn't get interesting, and instead of being just there for a special effects showcase, is that way on the story's design. The direction allows a really big scene at the end and it ends the film on such a high note that it makes the film that much stronger. One of the best jump sequences is Freddy's first appearance. It's quite a shock and comes as a great surprise.The Bad News: Get rid of that annoying kid! He did nothing in the film other than scream uncontrollably. I couldn't stand him. He had a few motherly moments with Heather, but he was simply on my nerves. Also, this may seem like a stupid gripe, but I don't like Freddy's claws in this one. I don't really like the way that his claws are curved. I liked his claws better when they were straight. Also, there is such a low body count in this movie that hardly anybody gets offed, and those that do are killed in the same way as those from other Freddy movies. He had no originality in his death scenes as his is so famous for. Freddy kills people in creative ways, but he had almost no originality to his kills here. Also, I thought that they should have brought back the whole cast from part one, not just Heather, John, and Robert. Johnny Depp and the person who played Tina should have been in the movie too, at least in the funeral scene. Oh well.The Final Verdict: With several small grips to complain about, this is one of the few horror movies that I would recommend to every one. There is nothing seriously wrong with this movie.Rated R: Violence, some language, and children in jeopardy",New Nightmare
61,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""New Nightmare""- A novel and enthralling film that may very well be Wes Craven's masterpiece.",10,13 November 2017,"Since creating the renowned and beloved horror franchise ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" back in 1984, series creator Wes Craven for the most part took an active step back from the series, feeling he said all he could say. Sure, he had some early story suggestions and did a bit of writing on the actually quite-good third installment ""Dream Warriors"", but other than that... the franchise grew beyond his original concept, and covered a whole gamut of tonalities and story-lines to which he had no involvement. And after the series finally concluded in the early 90's with the woefully misjudged self-parody ""Freddy's Dead"", it seemed like we had seen the last of the dream- master Freddy Krueger.But we all know that you can't keep a good slasher down. And Craven was finally able to convince the heads of New Line Cinema to go through with an old idea he'd had for quite some time... a story he had actually pitched seven years prior as an early concept for ""Dream Warriors."" What if Freddy... the character... the man from the movies... was able to escape the confines of the silver-screen and pick off victims in the ""real world""? It's a bold idea. And yet, one that could backfire very easily, and needed great care and thought to work. But as silly as it potentially sounds, I think Craven not only pulled it off... I think ""New Nightmare"" may very well be his masterpiece.The seemingly idyllic life of actress Heather Langenkamp (portraying herself) has taken a dark turn. Despite an adoring family including husband Chase (David Newsom) and young son Dylan (Miko Hughes), she's being thrown into emotional turmoil by recurring nightmares and the appearance of an unhinged stalker whom obsessively tries to contact her with threats of violence. But things might be looking up, as she is informed that director Wes Craven has began work on a seventh installment in the ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" franchise, and wants her to return as the star. However, when a personal tragedy rocks her world, she begins to see clues around her that point to an impossible scenario... seeing the tell-tale signs of her former cinematic nemesis Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund)... But how could this be? He's just a movie character! He's not a real person... is he?The great success of ""New Nightmare"" largely falls onto writer/director Craven's rampant creativity and the gung-ho dedication of his cast. The story finds a shockingly perfect balance in terms of tone and style that allows such a peculiar concept to work beautifully. It's self- aware without becoming farcical. It's deadly serious though it keeps a flowing and entertaining sense of pace. And it manages to deliver some of the most compelling characters of the entire franchise that are based on real people without coming across as silly and contrived. It's a fine balancing act that Craven pulls off with ease. And his visual direction is just magnificent, with the scope of the film feeling massive and earth-shattering, yet still grounded in genuine emotion and character. Here he shows some of the slickest and most wild work of his career, with flowing movement and a great visual contrast between the ""real"" and ""dream"" and ""movie"" worlds that helps usher the audience through the story without confusion. It's a visual powerhouse if ever I've seen one.The cast is just great, and you really get the feeling that everyone is putting their all into the film. Langenkamp is fantastic as our lead, and it's quite interesting to see how she grew as a performer in the ten years that have passed since the original film. Hughes, whom got his start in the Stephen King adaptation ""Pet Semetary"", is great fun, even if his performance can be shaky at times. And of course, Englund is just outstanding as the man of our dreams. Englund's role as Krueger is a bit different than previous incarnations, but he's clearly having the time of his life with the performance, and I do admire that he and Craven are actively trying to bring him back to his roots... he's a darker, edgier Freddy, and works wonders in establishing and bringing threat to the film.It's really fascinating. In many ways, ""New Nightmare"" shares parallels to one of Craven's other notable works- the brilliant film ""Scream"", which followed only two short years after. Both are sort- of deconstructions of the horror genre, yet they approach the material from different perspectives. ""Scream"" being more a meta- parody with elements of genuine terror... And ""New Nightmare"" being more an earnest horror film with elements of meta-satire. They compliment and contrast with each other quite well, and I do think the one-two punch of ""New Nightmare"" and ""Scream"" signify Craven at the top of his game. While some might argue that ""Scream"" was his best film, however, I do think that the edge definitely goes to ""New Nightmare""- it's a more impactful and a much more personal film, and I very much think it's crowning achievement of Craven's career.Though many condemn ""New Nightmare"" for failing to adhere to the canon and continuity of the ""Nightmare"" franchise as a whole, I have to commend it for trying something so radically different. I'll take an ambitious and unique effort over a stale retread any day of the week. And the fact that it might be Craven's best film is just the icing on the cake. I have no other choice- Wes Craven's ""New Nightmare"" easily earns a perfect 10 out of 10! It's one of the most criminally misunderstood and underrated films of the 90's, and an absolute success in virtually every capacity! Tense, thrilling and terrifying in all the best ways, this is one nightmare you won't want to end...",New Nightmare

Now having dreams of Freddy in her actual life, she is terrified for her life, the life of her partner and of course the life of her son.It transpires, that these new encounters are coin-sidle with Wes Craven's own dreams; he has started writing again, and his imagination is bringing Freddy to life and this time it's for real!

63,Howlin Wolf,Destroys the mythology previously created in the series.,4,28 February 2001,"I am shocked at the number of positive comments posted for this movie. The original is my favourite horror movie ever.  The rest (apart from possibly 3) suck big time.  Still, despite increasingly deteriorating execution they all contain the kernels of some good ideas.  Having the cast play themselves is not one of them.  I struggled to watch this because of the constant reminder that 'the rest were just a movie'.  Yes, I know any person with a modicum of intelligence will have  realised this, but the whole point of watching a movie where the villain is a hideously scarred dead psychopath who stalks kids through their dreams is the willing suspension of disbelief, where you forget how preposterous the scenario is and just allow yourself to be scared.  You can't do that if you're constantly being told that 'the rest were just a movie', because if that's true then what does that make this?  Are we supposed to find the idea of said psychopath stalking 'actors' rather than 'characters' more palatable?  You can't just bend the rules.  Either you want a film to be taken seriously or you don't, and if you do, then that means affording EVERY installment the same amount of artistic integrity, no matter how awful they were...  I have as much respect for the way Wes Craven revitalised the horror genre with 'Scream' as the next person, but a note to audiences in general: 'POSTMODERN' DOES NOT AUTOMATICALLY MEAN 'GOOD'.  In my opinion, this is an instance where an attempt at that style fell flat on its face. Why?   Well, the magic show's never as much fun when you know how all the tricks work...",New Nightmare

65,baumer,This should have been part 2,9,29 June 1999,"I love horror movies.  I love being scared and I love the fact that a movie (something make believe that I, as an intelligent person,knows is just images projected from a screen ) can manipulate my emotions and make me nervous.  This is one of those movies.  And in the 90's, there have only been two movies that have actually made me nervous in some scenes.  And those two movies are by Craven himself---Scream and this one.When this film first came out, it was ten years and six films after the original.  I have seen all the Freddy movies more out of morbid curiosity than out of interest.  And maybe a part of me was hoping to catch a glimpse of what made the first so damn scary.  And time and time again I was disappointed.  But when I read in Fangoria magazine that this new one was going to be directed by Craven, I got very excited.  Could it possibly be that this film would go back to it's roots?Yes, it did.There is no two ways about it, Craven cares about Freddy.  He cares about how he was supposed to be, not what he has turned into in the last decade. Freddy was not even remotely funny in the first one.  He was a brutal, maniacal, sadistic, bent on revenge murderer.  He wanted to slice Nancy in two and he did that to Tina ( actually sliceher into many pieces ).  But in the mindless sequels to come, he became Eddie Murphy.  And there was nothing frightening about the sequels.  They made money but they weren't true horror films.  But this one, well this one goes back to it's roots and is almost as scary as the first one.This story is about the film character of Freddy becoming real somehow. He has been a part of Lagenkamp, Saxon, Craven and Englund's life for so long that he has somehow become real.  And now what was once a simple film character actually haunts the cast of the original.  We even get to see Rod ( Tina's boyfriend from the original ) at one of the funerals.  And what makes the story scary is that now Freddy has decided to come after Heather's kid.This film goes back to all the techniques that made the first a classic. There is excellent direction to make us fear what is under the bed.  The lighting is classic horror film lighting and the music is perfect.  There is however one complaint that I have and that is when Freddy is chasing the kid across the road.  He has become larger than life.  He is like the Stay Puft marshmallow man from Ghostbusters.  And that it seems is much more like the other Nightmares, not Craven's version.  And that takes away the delight in watching what was otherwise a perfect horror film.I said in one of my reviews of a horror film that there are no films in the 90's that are truly scary.  However this one is as close to an 80's horror flick as you will get now a days.  It is very frightening and it is almost a prequel to Scream.  This is one film that should not be missed.  It is a tribute to what scary films are supposed to be.  If I want to laugh I'll see Chris Rock, but if I want to be scared, Craven is the man!",New Nightmare

Freddy Kruger is Wes Craven's brainchild and he's the only one who can make him scary. **** out ****",New Nightmare
67,mentalcritic,A nice try,5,29 April 2005,"By the mid-1990s, the horror segment of the film industry had run bone dry, thanks in no small part to crappy sequels. What makes this ironic is that New Nightmare is the seventh installment in the Nightmare On Elm Street franchise, and in spite of being far more creative than the five sequels preceding it, the market just hadn't recovered enough for it. Not that this is totally to blame for its relatively weak performance at the box office. In spite of being written and directed by the creator of the original, New Nightmare brings very little that could be considered new to the table. In fact, one could say that Wes Craven has been out of ideas since about 1990 or thereabouts.The conceit of New Nightmare is based in part on the manner in which Wes Craven gets ideas. The original Nightmare On Elm Street was based upon reports he'd read about Asian migrants dying in their sleep after complaining about nightmares that followed specific patterns. The idea in this sequel being that the idea is for real, and the source for that idea is interfering in the real world. It is, on the surface, a ludicrous idea, and it is a real credit to the cast that they can play it with such a straight face. Robert Englund in particular has a trying task in this film. Not only does he have to play a character that has been turned into a joke by three of the five preceding sequels, he has to portray himself taking that character seriously. It is a supreme irony that he is remembered for this role rather than the one he had in V.To its credit, New Nightmare assembles a lot of the cast and crew from the original in order to bolster this conceit. Even John Saxon, whose career had thoroughly tanked by this point, makes an appearance. Sadly, Johnny Depp, the most successful alumni from the original, is nowhere to be seen. Granted, he had a cameo in Freddy's Dead, but given how pitiful that film was, it would have been nice to see Depp playing himself in this one. Jsu Garcia and Amanda Wyss are also nowhere to be seen, although I suppose it is good that they did not try to stick every actor from the original into this new one. After all, you have to allow the story to flow a bit. But that is where the biggest of New Nightmare's problems come from. Much of the 112 minutes that New Nightmare runs for feels redundant, and entire sequences go by with nothing seeming to happen. It is not a measured pace, but rather a pace that leaves the viewer waiting for something to happen.Another problem, and this is one faced by all of the Nightmare On Elm Street sequels, is that the dialogue is incredibly stilted. Even Wes himself speaks in a fashion that I cannot really imagine him using elsewhere. I guess part of the problem lies in the unreal subject matter. No matter how hard one tries, one cannot really explain the mechanics of a demonic presence borne of one's imagination and keep a completely straight face. One cannot help but wonder at times if we could have been shown, rather than told, some of the mechanics of the story. A lot of films in this genre spend too much time explaining why we're meant to be scared, or how a particular antagonist works, paying no attention to the economy of time. Still, it is better than most of the previous Nightmare sequels, in which the writers relied upon the knowledge the viewer might have had about the previous stories.In all, I gave New Nightmare a 5 out of ten. It is worth spending a couple of hours watching while doing other things, such as writing this dreadful review, but as a form of entertainment, it is pretty ordinary.",New Nightmare
68,Fernando-Rodrigues,The New Nightmare: The Return of Freddy Krueger,6,9 February 2021,"It's an interesting concept, that could've been better executed if the script had a little more Freddy and gore, instead of something SO psychological.

69,ODDBear,3/4 great but with a bad ending,7,20 September 2006,"New Nightmare boasts a great idea for the final (until Freddy vs Jason anyway) Nightmare on Elm Street flick.Actress Heather Langenkamp, star of the original Nightmare on Elm Street film, keeps getting obscene phone calls from a Freddy impersonator. Strange things seem to happening left and right, her son seems to possessed by Freddy, Wes Craven himself is having Freddy nightmares etc. Maybe Freddy is crossing over from the big screen and into reality.Great idea. Can't compliment Craven enough for a really fresh idea to end the series on a high note after 2 very disappointing sequels. The film goes for atmosphere, eerie mood and solid old fashioned suspense for most of it's running time and succeeds brilliantly. Some real seat jumpers along the way and it's gradual buildup to Freddy's appearance is among Craven's best work as a director. But sadly the film takes a silly turn for it's conclusion, once Freddy has entered the picture the film takes a turn to the worse. The ultimate showdown (in Hell, apparently) seems an uninspired way to end a film that looked so promising. It seems that Craven didn't have a clue how to end the film properly.But still, top grades for the first 85 minutes or so, you're totally glued to the screen. Acting is splendid all around (even Craven plays himself to a tee) and overall the film is very good. Just could have used a better ending.",New Nightmare
70,ivo-cobra8,Wes Craven's Underrated Classic one of the best Elm Street movies!!!,10,1 November 2015,"Wes Craven's New Nightmare (1994) is one of the best horror films of the 90's. Possibly the second best Elms Street entry. But in my opinion A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master (1988) is much better than this. I just love this film to death! I love this film because it is Wes Craven direction debut. Wes Craven did write and directed this film. In this film, Freddy is depicted as closer to what Craven originally intended, being more menacing and less comical, with a greatly updated attire and appearance. The film is very scary and it does involve Freddy coming in to a real world. Nancy Thompson (Heather Langenkamp) returns this time Heather plays her self and she defeats the third time Freddy but this time it is different than it was in the first film. I can always watch A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984),A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master (1988) and New Nightmare and those three films just kick ass and they are my favorite horror slasher films in the genre! I love this movie so much mostly for the real world setting and the return of the characters from the first movie. Heather Langenkamp is the essential leading lady for a horror franchise. One aspect of this film I really liked was how Robert Englund just played himself and ""Freddy"" was more of a demonic killer from Hell. If you're looking for the scariest impersonation of Freddy, this is the one to watch. The story is about the original cast members of the first Freddy film being haunted by a ""reel"" Freddy. This movie is so good it stands on its own! New Nightmare is a 10.year anniversary of Wes Craven's A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) which that also counts in this film and it is mentioned in here!I like what they did hear what it would be like if Freddy was in the real world Freddy had a makeover he looked bad ass to me I thought this was some sort of re imaging Wes Craven try to do something different with Freddy but that's my opinion. The whole tone of it was great to me and like you said the actors playing themselves was great:)! The story it is a very clever concept for this series which it has a potential. I prefer this film over the Elm Street sequels except part 3 which I love the third entry to death! The same way I love the seventh entry in to series. Some people don't prefer this film into the series I do. The movie is very realistic and very scary. heather Langenkamp did the best job portraying her self and getting back to the roots of Nancy Thompson!I always have enjoyed this film, Wes did a solid job directing this horror slasher movie , I really feel terrible for his family and I can't believe a tragedy strike him and his family! It is the worst loss of my beloved Director ever! Very different entry into a Last Action Hero idea of a horror movie becoming reality. My favorite moment in the movie is the freeway sequence. Heather/Nancy takes sleeping pills to join in on a lucid dream, final showdown with Freddy to save an already captured Dylan. It occurs in a hot, steamy and water-logged dream scape ruin, apparently Freddy's home turf. The final showdown between Nancy and Freddy was outstanding, the bets sequence ever. Nancy with her help of her son defeat the demon Freddy they both lock him in a lit furnace where upon catching on fire and killing him. His true visage is shown amidst a fiery blast that was awesome!!! Nancy and Dylan escaping back to reality which was phenomenal. I love the actress Tracy Middendorf playing babysitter Julie. Gosh in the hospital scene Julie ends up punching a nurse and threatening another with a needle (cameo appearance by Wes Craven's daughter), and locks the door.) was awesome I love that scene! Seriously I thought the actress who played Julie was actually Jennie Garth because they both look alike, they were great. I love actress Tracy Middendorf playing Julie, I thought she made wonderful performance in this film. Fighting for Heather's son.The most two actors that blazed in this film were Heather Langenkamp and Robert Englund who played them self's and their famous roles Nancy and Freddy. I am also pleased that John Saxon did return in this film as a support cast and a close friend of Heather, he even played Donald Thompson again in this film. This time staying awake won't save you.. Ten years after writer and director Wes Craven (""Scream,"" ""The Hills Have Eyes"") brought his personal nightmares to the movie screen as Freddy Krueger in ""A Nightmare on Elm Street,"" the horrifying child killer returns, stepping out of his celluloid world to haunt the life of the actress who first defeated him on film. This seventh film in the Nightmare on Elm Street series has the cast starring as themselves in a wicked spin as key players from earlier installments are terrorized by Freddy Kreuger and his razor-fingered glove. That is the basic plot. Anyway I love this film and I am giving a 10 because this film deserves it and it is my third best favorite Elm Street horror slasher film!Wes Craven's New Nightmare is a 1994 American slasher meta film written and directed by original Nightmare on Elm Street creator Wes Craven.10/10 Grade: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval Studio: New Line Cinema Starring: Robert Englund, Heather Langenkamp, Miko Hughes, John Saxon, Sam Ruben Director/Writer: Wes Craven Producers: Wes Craven, Robert Shaye Rated: R Running Time: 1 Hr. 42 Mins.

71,fernandoschiavi,"With situations that border on nightmare and reality, persecutions from all sides, the chapter provides a satisfying ending to the franchise",6,26 September 2021,"When Wes Craven crafted the project for the return to his ironic and shrewd sharp-clawed antagonist, Wes Craven's New Nightmare, released in 1994, the film's starting point celebrated ten years. The character had gone through an extensive process of wear and tear in the midst of pop culture and the cultural industry, a field of production that scrutinizes a theme so much that any attempt to return would be faced as something repetitive or unnecessary. With the seventh narrative of the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise, the veteran was wise to disregard anything between chapters two and six, focusing on the actress who played the final girl Nancy and the developments of Freddy Krueger in her career.It was engaged with this possibility of making it stronger and more intense that the director conceived the return of Freddy Krueger. As magnetic and thought-provoking as the first film in the franchise, the seventh incursion is one of the best exercises in metalanguage in the entire history of cinema, not just in the slasher subgenre, but in a more panoramic analysis. In partnership with Kevin Williamson, filmmaker Wes Craven would enter the universe of Ghostface, another film masterpiece in the 1990s, two years later, but before that, he did very well with Freddy's rescue after so many bad sequels. Understanding like few others and playing with the maxims of the horror genre, the filmmaker makes a completely self-conscious film. On a platter, he presents us with the pretentious backstage of a production and takes the opportunity to rework even some characteristics of his villain. With a different make-up on his face and a new glove, Robert Englund has the opportunity to return to the role that immortalized him in the most frightening movie theaters. His catchphrases follow, but the scenes in which the disfigured monster appears are darker. If in the previous feature we even had a version of Krueger inside a video game (!), in this one, the desire is to work the character in a darker way.Years passed, the character came to gain an outcome that was thought to be definitive in The Hour of Nightmare 6: Final Nightmare - Freddy's Death (1991), but there was still a story to be told - especially after the movie premiered with highest grossing opening of the series. And Wes Craven, Krueger's father, would tell this plot. Applied, he looked for the previous films, but he simply couldn't come up with anything that could follow the plot of the other productions. He thought outside the box and came up with an interesting, metalinguistic concept. What if Freddy Krueger escaped the movies and attacked the cast? In this way, the director could resurrect characters from the original, such as Nancy and her father, played by Heather Langenkamp and John Saxon, respectively. Here, however, the actors would live themselves, blurring the lines between the real and the imaginary. Even Robert Englund, the interpreter of the fearsome Freddy Krueger, would appear without makeup. With this creative premise, Wes Craven was back in The New Nightmare: The Return of Freddy Krueger. And not just him. Krueger himself, weighed down with too many jokes in previous films, also returned with his more serious face.His focus is on the impact of fiction on the lives of actors who become celebrities and how the boundaries between what is reality and what is fiction become a terrifyingly thin area. Also responsible for the script, Wes Craven tells us the trajectory of Heather (Heather Langenkamp), a woman who married Chase Porter (David Newson) and has a son, Dylan (Miko Hughes). While her husband works as a special effects supervisor for film, she lives the season as a full-time mother. In Los Angeles, Heather has to deal with some frequent earthquakes, allegory for her personal life and psychological state, shaken by the constant presence of an obsessed fan who constantly turns her on and intones the famous Freddy Krueger theme song, scenes that are accompanied by driving. J. Peter Robinson's musical on the atmospheric soundtrack.And Does A New Nightmare work? Definitely, but it hits a lot lower than it could. It is fascinating to see Langenkamp, Robert Englund and especially Wes Craven interpret idealized versions of themselves (Craven is chosen to carry out the divine task of imprisoning the demonic Krueger, with the magic of his words...), as well as the scenes in which some character reads a script page that tells you exactly what happens on the scene. Freddy Krueger's new look is also spectacular. It follows Craven's original proposal, with a long overcoat, deeper makeup and a claw glove that approached bone claws. As Englund, Freddy has never been so frightening, and he doesn't bring with him the playful humor that dominated his last appearances.The problem is that there is nothing really remarkable. None of Freddy's attacks bring out the creativity that made the character so beloved, nor the terror that the more serious approach promised. There are some suspenseful scenes, like when Nancy's son adopts a strange behavior on a playground, or Freddy's own first appearance, which brings back the trick of walking on the walls of the original feature, but nothing worthy of Wes Craven. Heather's core protecting her son from an unseen threat doesn't thrill, even though the actress delivers a notable protective performance. Either way, it's interesting to see her tangentially reviving the character from the original feature film, doing doubles with John Saxon and Robert Englund. This one, even, seems to enjoy being able to appear on screen without Freddy's heavy makeup. Her participation, however, is the most of the missed opportunity, as it would be great to see Krueger attacking Englund in the realm of dreams, a scene that inexplicably is not included in the film.Wes Craven starts from a brilliant concept for his New Nightmare, but it was not enough for Freddy Krueger to return to being a strong force. It's a much more efficient farewell than the sixth installment of the franchise, but the character still deserved more. With situations that border on nightmare and reality, persecutions from all sides, from the supernatural to the real elements that pressure her, the 1984 final girl fulfills her protagonist role and accepts the clash with Freddy when entering her hell world, in an outcome exciting and with the ending already expected by the public: the antagonist's cage in the depths, with return only in the crossover with the monster from Friday the 13th, released in 2003, the exaggerated and fun Freddy vs. Jason, a film disconnected from Nancy's universe, focused exactly on the legacy of her main characters. If there were just this movie and the first one, Freddy Krueger would be a character with the same impactful legacy. Even in the role of fans, it is necessary to recognize that The Nightmare Hour franchise would quietly survive without all the sequels between the second and the sixth film, completely disposable and null as entertainment, such is the ""badness"" of its narrative structures.",New Nightmare
72,Movie-Misfit,Original Sequel And One Of Wes Craven's Best!!,9,3 November 2019,"A Nightmare On Elm Street 7, known globally as Wes Craven's New Nightmare, shouldn't have worked after the terrible 6th entry - Freddy's Dead. That film pretty much made a mockery of the brand as well as Freddy himself and for me, did not work at all putting to sleep a dried up film series that had run its course!Obviously creator and director Wes Craven had been watching and wasn't overly impressed with the entree's that had followed his classic original film. So on its tenth anniversary, he set out to make the ultimate sequel bringing to screen an original and amazing storyline, along with original cast members Heather Lengankamp (who played Nancy), John Saxon (who played her dad) and of course, Robert Englund (Freddy).Having these people play themselves - as the actors of A Nightmare On Elm Street - was just genius. Haunted by Freddy and their experiences caused by the first films production and success, Wes delivers one of his greatest films and one of the best horrors of the 1990's. I've made it clear in past reviews my disliking for 90's Hollywood cinema, but this stands out as a very well made film - also the most professional and best looking of the series.While it has great moments of horror throughout, the film has its fair share of well executed drama, acting, and creepiness disguised in a more realistic approach to cinematic horror! Another great addition is the role of Wes himself as the director he is. His idea to pull one last production out of the hat and end the nightmare is brilliant, with every little thing nodding to a bizarre clash of fantasy and real-life, meaning this  is real and the stakes just got higher!!And when he finally appears - Freddy himself is much meaner looking, much darker, and much more the horror icon we all wanted, rather than the comical pussy killer her became by the 6th entry...Wes Craven's New Nightmare is, for me, the best of the bunch. I did have dibs on Dream Warriors (part 3) being my fav, but after re-watching this since its release - I think I've changed my mind!",New Nightmare
73,acidburn-10,The Franchise bounces back,7,25 February 2008,"After the embarrassing mess Nightmare On Elm Street 6 was, it took Wes Craven to bring back Freddy in a fresh new way. You can't accuse this film of not being original. It's shot documentary style almost the whole way and interprets realitywellin a real way. We get to see the New Line offices, Robert Englund playing himself, Wes Craven at home (great pad man) and John Saxon being a nice guy. I bought it. The film starts fast putting its audience in a shaky environment from the get go: earthquakes, creepy phone call, TV's that run themselves and spooky dream sequences. The film also has many nods to the original Elm Street. Anybody that remembers the first one will double his/her pleasure upon viewing this film. From the opening sequence to the girl on the ceiling bit, to the ""screw your pass"" line to the Freddy phone, this flick is a perfect companion piece to the first. We even get to see Rod (Nick Corri) at a funeralfun stuff.I was really glad to see Heather Langenkamp back she rocked in parts 1 and 3 I rooted for her again the whole way John Saxon also plays himself and damn he must be a great man. Miko Hughes (Dylan) does well truly believable and has great chemistry with Heather Tracy Middendorf (Julie) is very likable and cute too, I really felt for her when she died and Robert England (himself/Freddy) is back on form.All in all this franchise did something that I though wasn't possible and that is make Freddy scary again and it was also nice to see some old faces again.",New Nightmare
74,jp_91,A creepy masterpiece!,10,15 January 2020,"Wes Craven back with a great sequel. New Nightmare is a perfect film mixing the real world with living nightmares, the fiction and reality are one. The script is a wonderful piece, the performances are amazing, Heather Langenkamp and Robert Englund are terrific actors. The atmosphere, cinematohraphy and special effects are magic inside this movie with soul, a fairy tale of horror lived in the real life of a fiction. Craven and his dream movie put into a film of flesh and blood. Masterpiece, one of the best 90's horror films!",New Nightmare
75,rossrobinson,The real life,10,27 September 2003,Wes Craven't New Nightmare takes you on a killing adventure. Heather Langenkemp who played the teenage Nancy get's her nightmare in a real life way. Her son is getting the chilling nightmares of Freddy Kruger played by Robert Englund. Heather and her son get into a nightmare together and they kill Freddy Kruger together.,New Nightmare
76,TalesfromTheCryptfan,An ingenious sequel!,9,14 January 2009,"Heather Langenkamp (As herself) is now a married woman with a husband and son named Dylan (Miko Huges). She has been offered to star in a 10th anniversary reunion movie of the popular ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" movie franchise from New Line Cinema and CEO Robert Shaye (Also playing himself), however there has been bizarre occurrences such as a few minor Earthquakes, strange Freddy-esquire phone calls with some weird deaths especially her husband. It seems that a demon posing as Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund) decided to make the Elm Street films for real as Freddy begins to threaten Heather and her son for now she decides to read a screenplay by Wes Craven (As himself) so she can reprise her role as Nancy again in order to stop the boogeyman.An usual but terrific installment of the popular franchise that started brilliantly in 1984. This one doesn't really have the continuity of parts 1 to 6 but it's a different film of the franchise for it sets itself into reality and the idea of what if Freddy Krueger actually killed people in real life. This blend of horror, fantasy and psychological supernatural thriller that works like a charm thanks to an original idea by writer-director-creator Wes Craven. This film does co-star John Saxton, Linda Shaye, Nick Corri, and Tuesday Knight (From Elm Street 4) including Robert Englund as himself. This has a great concept in the vein of ""Last Action Hero"" about a movie-within-a-movie about a movie theme, there is some gory violence and dark themes that fans of the original liked more then the comical sequels that followed.Now this sequel is a winner! followed by ""Freddy Vs. Jason"".",New Nightmare
77,Space_Mafune,Not sure what the big deal was...,5,4 December 2002,"I've seen and heard this film get praised and praised but really I found it to be a disappointment. Wasn't it better than the sequels??..well yes it may be better than most of them(which the exception of 3 & 4) but it's hardly anything truly great.Things I disliked about this film:Predictable: oh how utterly predictable this has all become by this point and this film which does start off promising ends up back into the same old familiar territory at the end.The kid: he is so dang annoying. Too often they go overboard with having him either trying to be overly sweet or overly menacing.The best thing I liked about the film:Heather Langenkamp who despite being put through the physical and emotional ringer with this movie looks absolutely ""smoking"" throughout it. Her effort alone rises it above most of the Nightmare films and I continue to prefer those in which she appeared.",New Nightmare
78,danielcereto,Excellent conclusion,8,8 September 2021,"I just finished today September 2021, the whole movie series again. This one is clearly one of the best because of it's originality, the reimagination of Freddy's world and obviously the return of Wes Craven. A great underrated one, and a huge step up from previous 5th and 6th, definitely the worst ones.",New Nightmare
79,baileycrawly,Wes is the Hero (For the Third Time Now),9,26 October 2019,"After Freddy's Dead, the Elm Street series was in trouble. There's a genuine fatigue all-around from that series. You've got a villain that, in the beginning, was a uniquely iconic and menacing figure-turned jokester with the subsequent chapters. What you're left with is a hollow shell of a character you once loved to hate.
In walks Wes Craven who, YET AGAIN, sees the state of the series and decides it's time to change things up a bit. And what you have is not only exactly what the series needed to get itself into good standing again, but it's perhaps one of the greatest horror movies of all time.
It takes Freddy Krueger into the ""real world."" You've got some stellar cast members, with Heather Langencamp coming back for her third movie in the franchise, Robert England playing a new-and-improved Freddy, the old-fashioned Freddy, and himself, and Robert Shaye, the head of New Line Cinema. I mean, even Wes Craven himself had a role. They went to great lengths to make this as ""real-world"" as they possibly could, and it paid off. You could really care for these characters, and it made the experience all the more special.
Unfortunately, this is the last truly great Nightmare film. It's also the last one that Wes was intimately involved with, and it shows. He left the series on one of its highest notes and this, his last entry in the saga he created, is special and stands out among the other sequels. May he Rest In Peace.",New Nightmare
80,DavidSim240183,Classic Craven!,10,23 May 2008,"The Nightmare on Elm Street series is one of the most lucrative franchises ever to grace the horror genre. Its success helped New Line Cinema through a particularly lean time in its history, and transformed Freddy Krueger into the most popular horror pin-up since Michael Myers.Wes Craven's original film was an absolute classic of the genre. The Elm Street sequels are a whole different kettle of fish. They reduced Krueger to little more than a wise-cracking pop up effect. None of the sequels came with the eerie atmosphere or disturbing distortions of reality Craven infused the original with. By the time of Elm Street 6, Freddy had been killed off and brought back so many times, the character had lost all credibility.When I learned of another new Elm Street film, it didn't exactly raise my hopes. Not even the return of Wes Craven could turn my head. It just seemed a shallow attempt on New Line's part to milk even more money from the audience, hungry for Freddy!But I should have had more faith. Because Wes Craven's New Nightmare is not just another cut and slash job (Freddy and filmmakers included!), but a startling reinvention of the Elm Street series. Its the only one in the entire franchise that matches up to the original. Thanks in no small part to having Wes Craven back in the directors chair.What shocks from the offset is New Nightmare isn't like any of the others that came before it. In spite of the trailers efforts to mislead us, this is a quite different film from your standard Elm Street saga. New Nightmare, quite ingeniously, takes place in the real world. Where the actors play themselves. And the setting isn't teenage bedrooms and shadowy boilers but film sets and studio lots.A theme that runs through much of Wes Craven's work is the blurring line between reality and illusion. A Nightmare on Elm Street was the perfect aesthetic for that conceit. But New Nightmare takes it to even more incredible heights. It was undoubtedly the film that convinced Kevin Williamson that Wes Craven was the right director to bring the like-minded Scream to the screen.New Line Cinema are making a new Freddy Krueger film. Wes Craven is still doctoring the script. And they want Heather Langenkamp to star in it. For those stalwart Krueger fans, Langenkamp played Nancy in the very first film. She's not so sure she wants to, especially since her fictional life has begun to intrude on her personal one. Heather has a stalker, who calls her up in a Freddy voice. Leaving odd one letter notes in the mail. And she's having nightmares.All real world problems. But when her son Dylan becomes obsessed with the Elm Street series, and her husband dies in an horrific accident, Heather becomes convinced Freddy is alive. And wreaking havoc in the real world.I remember a lot of hype around New Nightmare back in 1994. Everyone was eager to see Freddy and his finger-knives again. But the film was a surprise box-office failure. Contemporary critics gave it enthusiastic reviews, but it flopped badly with its target audience. Perhaps because the film's conceit was too much for them to get they're heads around. But I'm in the minority calling for its reappraisal. Because New Nightmare is one of the most conceptually challenging, inherently dazzling horror films of the 1990s.Craven is constantly playing around with our beliefs. We're never sure from one moment to the next what is real and what isn't. Dreams masquerading as reality is hardly a new thing, but its the way Craven puts them across that makes the film so spooky. And the meta-fictional angle makes things even murkier. Nothing is clear.The whole film within a film technique could seem gimmicky to some nitpickers, but I rather enjoyed it. Not only does it give things a whole new spin, but it opens the film up to a world of possibilities. Craven gets in a lot of satirical jabs at New Line Cinema's expense. They want to keep the Elm Street series going, even if Freddy's dead. New Line CEO Robert Shaye blames it on the fans, but it is to make more money. Both Heather Langenkamp and Robert Englund engage in self-parody. A limo driver loves driving people like Heather around because it brings him closer to the stars. She reminds him (pointedly) she's not that much of a star. A sad reflection of her sporadic career outside of Elm Street.But best of all is Craven himself. One scene provides a fascinating insight into his character. He explains to Heather when he dreams, he will often write them down. Which may go some way towards explaining why dream logic plays a big part in his work. His theories on the Elm Street series giving rise to and containing Freddy are fascinating to think about. Now that they're over, he's loose in our world. Scary stuff!Craven wittily and cleverly plays around with film conventions. New Nightmare occasionally turns inward. Heather reads the script Wes has written so far, even saying the exact same dialogue. The words on the printed page are exactly where the film itself (its a work in progress) is up to. The scene ends with a Fade Out, and the film itself does just that.The film's flaws are minor. Dylan's possession by Freddy seems more Exorcist than Elm Street. The climax is oddly uninvolving. And I never once believed Robert Englund as himself. He's just too Freddy-like in his inflections. But Wes Craven's New Nightmare is the only Elm Street sequel that feels strikingly original. The way fiction and reality converge at the end is astonishing. And I love the final scene. Heather reads to Dylan Wes's script like it were a bedtime story. And its the script of the film you've just been watching.",New Nightmare
81,emperor_bender,"Lights, camera, FREDDY",7,19 February 2008,"I thought this was a decent entry to Freddy's reign of terror. Heather Langenkamp returns as herself AND Nancy. Robert Englung is very good at playing two very contrasting characters, himself and the REAL Freddy Krueger. John Saxon wasn't half bad either. This movie is the opposite of part 5 I think. Part 5 was big on kills, horrible on story. This movie is good with the story, but if you're looking for mass killing...sorry, this isn't quite the movie for you then. I'd compare this movie to the first one in a lot of ways, but that was intended it seems. Only grievance here is that Heather seems to have TOO much bad luck at times and it gets a little annoying. No one seems to be on her side. But don't let that stop you from enjoying this movie. 7/10",New Nightmare
82,skybrick736,Wes Craven's New Nightmare 6/10,6,12 March 2015,"Give kudos to Wes Craven wanting to do a creative idea for a sequel to his Nightmare on Elm Street masterpiece. The last few movies of the franchise were very run of the mill so it was pretty refreshing watching a different take of the series. I'll always give bonus points to a movie for bringing back actors from previous roles, since it shows it takes the story seriously. Heather Langenkamp character was a little rough to begin with but after a bit she played herself fantastically. Wes Craven, John Saxon, and even Robert Englund outside the Freddy costume were really solid too. What's unique from a reviewer's standpoint is seeing the contrast in great ideas and concepts but it followed them with some really disappointing scenes. The story had sky-high potential to be a really special horror movie, unfortunately there were just too many hiccups here and there. To be specific, most of these scenes occurred in the hospital. The ending was a little far-fetched too but I especially enjoyed the interactions with Heather and John, since it gave an actual feeling of nostalgia. New Nightmare is definitely worthy of a look and is one of the better installments to the Elm Street franchise.",New Nightmare
83,malkane316,Quick Reviews!!,8,18 April 2005,"After 10 years, Wes Craven returned to the series and characters which brought him his greatest success in an attempt to inject some life into the franchise and again try to re-define the horror genre. A New Nightmare is a success on both counts, even if it was only an experiment and stepping stone between projects. A New Nightmare brings attention to themes such as Art imitating life and vice-versa, love of horror movies, the life of a cult figure, and how we perceive violence, censorship, and of course the relationship between parent and child.Wes Craven has been having nightmares and is using them to write a seventh installment in the Elm Street series. He contacts the star of Parts 1 and 3, Heather Langenkamp, who played Nancy, and asks if she would be interested in returning to the role one last time. She turns down the role as she is a happily married mother who has tried to put the films and Freddy behind her. However, the fans are ravenous for more. Recently Heather has been getting strange phone calls, probably from another stalker or obsessive fan who claims to be Freddy, calls which upset her and her son Dylan. She has also started to have nightmares, some involving Freddy but puts it down to stress etc.Her husband Chase is out of town working on a film. On his return home he falls asleep at the wheel, crashes and dies. Heather insists on checking the body, and finds claw marks over his chest. She now believes that Freddy, or someone pretending to be him is stalking her family. Freddy is not happy that he has been forgotten and wants out into the real world. He attacks Heather in her dreams, and she is drawn into a final battle to save her son and herself from the demon, who now seems to be scarier, stronger and more violent. She realises she must act as Nancy to take on Freddy in her dreams.The film returns to the scares, imagery, themes and gore which made the original so popular. Bringing back several members of the original cast Craven manages to create a perfect, dreamlike blend between the real world and the dream world. Heather is an actress but must remember that it was the spirited youth of her character which saved Nancy's life. However, the fact she has grown up, and that it was just a job means that it is difficult to believe such things. She is in danger of becoming like her character's mother which will end in her own and her son's deaths. Freddy is now presented as pure evil, with a few catchphrases but now more scary than funny like he once was, a creature completely intent on becoming real.Langenkamp takes the difficult role in her stride and is just as good as she was in the original, now a caring mother rather than a paranoid teen. Englund revels once more in his role and seems to enjoy himself more here than in some of the previous films. Saxon and Craven are good in small roles, Hughes is annoying at times as Hughes but is still good, and the rest of the cast are adequate. The gore is back to basics, not overblown like in the last few films, and certain scenes are shocking- the 'skin the cat' scene is probably the most memorable. Craven again knows how our minds and fears work, the fact that Dylan thinks his toy dinosaur can protect him is a good example of this, that we create a blanket or defender for ourselves when there is no-one else to help us. This is overall a good idea well worked, and a precursor to the Scream series, and a respectable ending (so far) to the Elm Street series.8 out of 10",New Nightmare
84,theshadow908,Amazingly original and creepy horror film.,8,23 June 2006,"Wes Craven's New Nightmare features Heather Lengankamp, who played Nancy in the first and third films, living a normal life with her husband and son. Lately, strange things have been happening, and her son isn't acting like himself. She is called in for an interview with New Line Cinemas, where she finds out that Wes Craven is making a new Nightmare film. The events of this film are beginning to unfold in the real world, because Freddy Krueger is angry at being killed off in the last film, so he steps out of fantasy and into reality to go after the makers of the original film. Now Heather Lengankamp must protect her son and defeat Freddy one last time...Only this time, it's real.I love this movie. I personally think it's just as good as the first movie. This is one of the most original and ingenious plots for a horror movie I've ever seen. All of the people involved with the original films appear as themselves, including Heather Lengenkamp, John Saxon, Robert Englund, and Wes Craven. Freddy is amazing in this movie. He appears with his trademark brown hat, but now he's in a much darker red and green sweater along with a brown tattered trench coat, and his burns are more severe. Also, his trademark knives are actually coming from his fingers. The best part about it is that in this film, Freddy isn't a wise cracking killer...He's an all business violent and brutal killer.This movie features the best acting for a slasher movie I've ever seen, but then again, almost every actor in the movie plays themselves, so it would be pretty hard to screw that up.Overall, this movie is on a par with the original, and I'd recommend it to any horror fan.8/10",New Nightmare

But there is something primeval at work. Freddy Krueger was the most recent incarnation of an ancient evil, contained for centuries in various stories and fairy tales and he's been dormant long enough ""He wants to make another movie with the same cast"" but this time in the real world.And Craven makes good on the promising premise, frequently referencing the original film with kills and plot points and eventually using the fairytale of Hansel and Gretyl as the device to kill Freddy once and for all. All of this while creating a surreal atmosphere and some great chilling moments.The performances in this are fine, Heather Leagankamp, Wes Craven and Robert Englund are all on form and the brief appearances of John Saxon and other series regulars help add to the desired effect of a greatest hits show with a twist.This is a good film. Good atmosphere, terrific premise with some nice kills. Exactly what you want from a horror film and then some.",New Nightmare
86,Med-Jasta,I can't praise this enough...,10,9 September 2021,"I was kind of in shock the first time I saw this. I enjoyed it of course but couldn't get the movie out of my head. I had to watch it again a few days later to really grasp the level of genius that this movie has achieved. Who would have thought of a sequel by breaking the fourth wall and turning the franchise in on itself? Wes Craven.In many ways the precursor to Scream. But instead of using this as a way to make fun of the franchise/the movies he didn't make, he says that the other movies were a good thing but keeping Freddy at bay. And by saying that the others were movies it makes the ""real"" Freddy much scarier. By acknowledging the fiction the real Freddy is much scarier as the evil entity/devil whatever he is. And that trench coat is awesome. Very fitting. And the new glove looks like claws and is very scary.Coming late to the party I was familiar with the story, but the movie was way different then I thought. I always heard that Freddy haunted the set. But it's not like that at all. It's an original story. Not only to the franchise but to movies in general. I'd say better than the original. And it's not full of in jokes like The Player. This could just as easily not be about Freddy and some movie.This is actually a scary movie. It doesn't rely on jump scares and gore. The terror is constant throughout but you don't really see a whole lot. There's just tension and the threat around every corner. And Freddy is hardly in it. I love the atmosphere with the earthquakes and everybody experiencing what Heather is. And of course her son. The little touches of weird unexpected things is what I love. When she's on the phone and the tongue gets her and then Dylan starts foaming at the mouth. Or when Heather goes into the grave and her husband rises and bloody tears come down.And of course Miko Hughes. That kid is great. He achieves everything he's supposed to. He's cute, he's sweet, he's scary, he's nice, scared... Some kids are just one or the other but he does it all. I love it when he wants Heather to finish reading the story and says, ""It's important."" Very intense.The non actors do a good job and if I didn't know, I wouldn't know they weren't. This movie does a good job at being the first movie but not. And it makes sense that Freddy is engineering it that way. Because he wants revenge or whatever so he's putting her though what kept him away. And of course Wes doesn't really know, he's just guessing. Which is the best explanation in fantasy like this. Too much explanation can kill it.Because I heard that this movie was actually good, and being a fan of the first, I took it upon myself to tackle this franchise. The previous two, 5 and 6 I couldn't finish. But the others were watchable. And 3 is actually good. I know Wes wanted to do this movie then. Which is frustrating that the studio didn't let him. But at least it gave us Dream Warriors. For me all you need is 1, 3 and 7. And you don't need to see any of the others except for 1 to get this movie.I know this didn't do well on it's release. The franchise was already dead. But I hope that the fans like this and that this has achieved the acclaim that it deserves. Because it's much more than a Freddy movie or just a sequel.",New Nightmare
87,Donatien3,Freddy's back in a nightmare-within-a-nightmare,9,15 July 2009,"By the end of 1991's ""Freddy's Dead"", the NOES series had run its course. At first, Freddy was a scary, mysterious killer who attacked his victims in the one place they couldn't escape: their dreams. As the sequels accumulated, and Freddy became more popular, the tone of the films became more comedic. Freddy turned into a wisecracking killer who would dispose of his victims with plenty of imagination and one-liners. Sure it was funny, but it was hard to be scared of him, and the Freddy-kills-kids-in-their-dreams premise eventually wore thin.""Wes Craven's New Nightmare"" takes the series back its roots with a film-within-a-film structure (or in this case, a nightmare-within-a-nightmare). The plot basically involves Freddy, freed from the trap of the movies, looking to invade the real world through Heather Langenkamp and her son, Dylan. With Wes writing a new script, the lines between fiction and reality become blurred as Wes' script directly correlates with Heather's 'real' life as she aims to stop Freddy. All the real life actors play themselves, while Robert Englund appears as himself and Freddy.The problem with the self-aware film-within-a-film genre is, if done badly, it can look self-indulgent and too in-jokey. Fortunatley, Wes manages to balance the numerous references to the old movies (and explains why the series eventually grew stale) while moving the plot forward, though he still pays homage to Freddy the pop culture icon: at the start of the movie Heather does a TV interview to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the first NOES, Englund comes on stage dressed as Freddy, where he poses for the adoring studio audience. Also, when Heather visits the New Line Cinema Offices to discuss the movie, there is Freddy paraphernalia everywhere, including a Freddy version of the Warhol Marilyn Monroe 'pop art' painting.The best thing about this movie is the characterisation of Freddy. As opposed to the jokey, almost Looney Tunes-style villain from the sequels, in ""New Nightmare"" Freddy is taken back to the creepy, menacing bad guy from the original NOES (though there are a few one-liners to keep fans of 'funny Freddy' happy) with a bonier face and razor glove. Consequently, this film is a lot creepier, and is up there with NOES 1 and 3 as the best of the franchise. While it lacks the inventive killings which made the series so watchable (especially some of the poorer sequels) that's not such a big drawback for this film.In summary, ""New Nightmare"" breathes life into a much-loved series. It does so by taking a fresh film-within-a-film approach and bringing Freddy back to his original characterisation, without losing the humour of previous sequels.",New Nightmare
88,Rendanlovell,"Dylan, why?",7,13 August 2020,"There's long stretches of this where I was convinced that this was the best of the series. The first half is a perfectly executed slasher set up for starters. Characters are well established, the pace moves quickly, and it clearly states the blurry lines between film and reality.One of the films biggest appeals for me was those blurred lines. I loved the idea of taking Freddy to the ""real world"". Now, in the universe of the other films that is those characters reality in a sense. But this takes on the extraordinarily difficult task of setting this plainly in OUR universe. Nancy, Heather Langenkamp, returns in this playing...Heather Langenkamp.Wes craven is back as the writer director of this film and he is also back as writer director inside the film itself. Most of the original actors are back, you guessed it, playing themselves. The story of this Nightmare revolves around Heather. She's married to a special effects designer, just like in reality, and she has a son. But all is not well when Freddy makes his return, this time, in the real world.Love that about this. There's scenes were characters are literally reading the films script and Robert Englund even shows up as the classic Freddy we all know and love. One of the biggest story elements that I found interesting but maybe not developed enough was the constant earthquakes that happen throughout this. It seems to be a bit of a metaphor for Heather's pyschie slowly crumbling as she attempts to shelter her child from something that shouldn't exist.Which I love in concept but near the climax of the film it's sort of abandoned. Which leads me to think that these earthquakes (which sometimes are only felt by Heather) are simply representative of Freddy bursting into the real world. This is much less interesting to me. Speaking of uninterested things, let's talk about Dylan, Heather's son. He sucks. In fact, he's the worst part of the film. There's a great scene where Freddy is dragging a girl across the ceiling of a hospital room that's pretty awesome but it's totally ruined by Dylan.He's hardly ever convincing. I know it's easy to poo poo child actors and normally I don't feel the need to mention them. The problem here is that he is in a leading role, and he's terrible. When you have this much screen time devoted to someone that can't act it actively disturbs the immersion. Especially since this is going for an incredibly realistic tone and setting. It would be like taking Haley Joel Osment out of The Sixth Sense and replacing him with a child that can barely hold a straight face during the intense scenes.He unfortunately ruins a fair amount of the horror scenes in this. If this was as goofy as some of the other sequels his terrible wouldn't rub off in a bad way like it does here. But since this is probably the most serious and menacing Freddy has ever been this can't be allowed to fly. It really is to bad because a lot of his scenes and the ideas he represents are great. Freddy is terrifying once again and the real world aspect of it do a lot to cloud some of the bad elements though. (i.e dated effects, bland cinematography.)",New Nightmare

Heather Langenkamp is playing her self and she is behind the scenes and she is watching as film is been made. Her husband Chase (David Newsom) is a make up artist he designed new blade glove that is in the film. Her son is behind the scenes as well his name is Dylan (Miko Hughes). Chase is touching the glove and the glove moves and cuts his fingers. They think is malfunction, but than it comes to life and starts killing people on set and it is about to kill Chase and than Heather wakes up it was actually a dream and there is an earthquake and Dylan run down stairs and the earthquake stops.Heather notices that Chase cuts on his fingers, she thinks because of the dream. Chase says because of the earthquakes. Heather get's a lot of phone calls somebody sounds like Freddy and says same sentences lines from the film. Heather goes to this talk show, where they talk about 10 year anniversary of ""A Nightmare On Elm Street movie. There is a surprise guest in which Robert Englund comes out dressed as Freddy Krueger. later Heather goes to New Line Cinema in which producer Robert Shaye ask her if she would like to be in A New Nightmare On Elm Street film that Wes Craven is written and directing and she declines. She says no because of personal reasons. She has a family now, but then Chase get's killed where Heather goes to morgue and she sees claws in his chest from Freddy's glove.Heather talks to Wes Craven and he tells her that Freddy is now coming out of his films in to reality. He is trying to make the reality to A Nightmare On Elm Street film, so Heather starts to becoming Nancy. She is got a grey in her hair and she starts says certain lines from the first film. In a way to stop Freddy is to make another film, or to keep the story alive. Her son Dylan has train state, he is saying certain line from the film and his walking around in train state, he is trying to attack Heather with knives, he has kitchen knives taped on his fingers. She takes him to hospital and they think she is bad parent telling her she is making him watching this films she make and she says no. They want to take Dylan away from her. Dylan is taken away from Freddy. He is take to an dream escape route where Freddy lives and he is captive there. heather takes sleeping pills and goes there to rescue he son to waterfall escape route and she defeats Freddy and they come back and they are at home. heather reads this script the beginning od the first a Nightmare On Elm Street film, that is how it ends.I love the movie to death, it is a good movie I can't say is better than 1 and 3. I would say 1, 3 and 7 are the best one in the Elm Street series. New Nightmare is a good book end series. They are certain dream sequences are not to bad, I like them. They are certain scenes from the first film, the whole scene where the girl gets drag all the away the sealing that fame scene, that is re created in the scene, this film certain lines that Freddy and Heather says. That is interested concept, good premise. I like the way Freddy looks in this film it is a different look. The glove is different, it is like bones you can combine with metal glove. Freddy is kind a in a trench coat, he is a little different looking. It is still Freddy. Robert Englund did a really good job as always, he was plays him self in this film a little bit not shows much. It is kind a interesting they did have Robert Englund in this film and he kind a fought Freddy in it. That would become cool, I wonder if they had that idea in the script. They had Robert Englund going somewhere and you never hear about that idea in the script or Robert Englund in a script, that would be interesting.Overall good acting: Heather Langenkamp did an excellent job. She is beautiful, gorgeous and she is my favorite horror actress as Nancy Thompson she is the best horror heroine ever. It is nice to see behind the scenes and seen Wes Craven, Robert Shaye the producer of the films. It is like reality show in the setting in this film. It is a movie it try's to say it is in reality happening. It is a pretty good film, it is definitely improvement from 2, 4, 5, 6 and remake. I wouldn't say is better than 1 and 3 but it is a good book end series.It is my third favorite Elm Street film it is a real dark horror film. This and Scream in my opinion are both great fantastic horror movies in the 90's from Wes Craven.",New Nightmare
92,Toronto85,Wes Craven's New Nightmare,7,27 March 2011,"New Nightmare was an all new creative re-imagining of the series from the view point of the actors and writers from the original films. In this 7th installment, the idea was to have the story evolve around the Heather Langenkamp as the actress dealing with the lifestyle of being a legendary horror icon in a lot of ways. We first see Heather being tormented by a stalker of some sorts who is sending her strange mail and calling her house sounding like ""Freddy"". It's very interesting to watch scenes like that because it is a reality in Hollywood. Actors and actresses have stalkers. So this film is sort of like a film inside of a film. Eventually her husband Chase gets clawed by Freddy while driving home one night, and the minute he dies we see Heather waking up. It gives us the idea that she dreamed it, which is the story of the original films. Whatever you dream of turns into a reality.The whole film makes us question what is real and what isn't. Eventually we begin to see that Freddy has been sort of born into the real world by the making of the Nightmare films. In this one, Wes Craven plays himself and is writing a new sequel. It is through his script that Freddy Krueger becomes a real being. There are many scenes in New Nightmare that pay homage to the first film. There is the girl that gets killed on the ceiling like Tina in the first. Freddy's tongue comes out of the phone, Nancy while going up the stairs steps into some sort of a goo, etc.Heather Langenkamp looks great, the ten years in between this and the 1984 film have been very good to her. It's great to see Robert Englund without the make up on, being himself. I like all of the realism towards ""Freddy Mania"" and the Nightmare franchise in general, there's a scene with screaming kids dressed as Freddy yelling for Robert Englund's autograph. This movie does move a little slow. I think it picks up during the hospital scenes when Dillon is admitted to the psych ward basically. Freddy's make up looks better in this than parts 5 and 6. I think in Dream Child, his make up started to look really rubbery and fake. It's done better in this one.New Nightmare is almost like a whole different film then the Nightmare on Elm Street movies. If you judge it based on being a Freddy film, you probably won't like it. This isn't an Elm Street sequel, in a lot of ways it's an all new movie with much more thought and creativity put into it than Rachel Talalay's dismal Nightmare 6. Check this one out, I think it's very underrated. Wes Craven has become a horror legend over the years, and he created a great concept in this New Nightmare.7/10",New Nightmare
93,Gresh854,The Best Nightmare Sequel Yet,7,8 August 2018,"Wes Craven's New Nightmare bears a refined premise that is just so sly and inventive! This is exactly what the Nightmare franchise needed in order to get its claws back on track! What carries this entire movie on a high-level wasn't only just Craven's genius idea to have the actors play themselves in a reality-based environment, but was also Heather Langenkamp, who gives by far the best performance in this entire series. The only major flaws I had with this rendition was the abundance of references to the original which got pushy at times, and the substantial amount of dream sequences which sometimes gave the film too much reliance. Despite this, New Nightmare stands to be my favorite sequel out of this entire franchise and marks one of Craven's greatest achievements! (Verdict: B)",New Nightmare

A fantastic kind off sequel in the Nightmare Series and one of my favourite in the franchise with an amazing story and great new take on Freddy this movie is awesome.Standing on its own this movie dosent connect with main storyline of the Franchise but tells its story based around them which I think is a brillaint idea and one that is unique to the Nightmare Franchise and is very meta.Love the idea of Freddy being this evil Entity who has been trapped in the movies when they've been making them and now he's out and killing the people involved in making them because now the story has stopped.
The design for this new Freddy is awesome and one of the best adaptations of him he's much darker and sinister.Heather Langencamp does an amazing job in this one playing both herself and becoming Nancy one last time to stop Freddy once and for all its an amazing idea bringing her back and seeing her transition from Heather to Nancy is such an interesting idea.Love the scene we're Wes Craven explains to Heather that she being Nancy is the only narrative that can stop Freddy and she has to be Nancy one last because she was the first to stop him in the movies and how it was Heather who gave Nancy her strength it's a great scene that sets the stage for third act.The film can a little slow at times and the story can drag abit and we don't see many kills but it dosent ruin movie the story keeps you interested through out and is a great watch just wish we would of seen more kills.Favourite moment is definitely the Julie kill it's a nice homage to the Tina kill in the original but we see how Freddy does it this time it was great to watch and definitely a creepy scene and Freddy is scary it's also pays homage to my favourite kill in the original.Verdict 9/10 just a fantastic sequel kind off that tells its own and bases around the 6 movies great idea having Freddy be this evil entity who was trapped in the movies and is now out causing evil. Heather Langencamp is great and her becoming Nancy one last time is amazing to see. This movie proves Wes Craven was a genius when it came to horror.",New Nightmare
96,Thats_some_scary_stuff_Reviews,The series should have stopped at Freddy's dead.,2,22 November 2008,I have finished watching all of the Nightmare on Elm Street movies and they were a pretty good series. I wish it had finished on Freddys Dead. The last installment is the worse one. This film was completely useless. The only reason it gets 2/10 is because it creeped me out a few times and i loved seeing appearances from people from the other installments.I hated the death scenes. There was only a few. The acting as always was OK except for Robert Englund who is always great. I hated this more then Freddys revenge. Here's the final order: 1. A Nightmare on Elm Street. (8/10) 2. Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare. (7/10) 3. A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master. (7/10) 4. A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: The Dream Warriors. (7/10) 5. A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child. (6/10) 6. A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge. (3/10) 7. Wes Craven's New Nightmare. (2/10)I don't recommend.

It's a nice change and really subverts what you'd normally think would be another Freddy movie. But it obviously is also another Freddy movie.Heather Langenkamp was good to see back, without her the series felt empty. And she reprises her role perfectly.The story and concept of the movie in general is smart, though somewhat confusing and ambiguous at times. Though that doesn't detract too much from the whole story or immersion. Freddy's look in this movie was alright, but I still prefer his look from the first movie. It just felt a bit too much and felt too fake.The visual and practical effects, important in this series, were okay. I still yearn for more dream-esque moments. This movie isn't all that creative, lots of bedsheets ripped due to Freddy emerging from the bed, and not much else that is all too memorable. So I missed some of that.Overall it was still enjoyable, though the hospital section of the movie really made me lose interest due to its predictability and just knowing how those types of scenes play out. It felt generic.And even though this movie does have a unique flair, it didn't feel that much like an Elm street movie somehow, it felt more generic horror movie. I think this is due to Freddy not really having a personality here anymore. Sever lack of memorable one liners. And the ones that were there were meh. Freddy was reduced too much to just a ''old'' monster. This also goes for the ending which felt very underwhelming.",New Nightmare
102,HorrorFan1984,Wes Craven's New Nightmare,8,12 April 2020,"We take a step out of the reel world and enter the ""real"" one in Wes Craven's New Nightmare, a film that follows the life of Elm Street actress Heather Langenkamp and her battle against Freddy Krueger when Craven approaches her to do one more Nightmare movie.Heather Langenkamp is living a quiet life in LA following her work in Elm Street 1 and 3. We see that she is married to a special effects coordinator named Chase and they have a young son named Dylan. She is also getting obscene phone calls from who she thinks is just a crazed fan of the films. New Line Cinema exec Robert Shaye gives her a call to come in because they are planning to do a 7th film and want her to star in it.Dylan begins having night terrors and starts reciting the ""1,2, Freddy's coming for you"" song. Heather refuses to do the movie because of the effect horror and the obscene calls seem to have on her son. After her husband is murdered by Freddy, Heather realizes that the 7th Nightmare film Wes Craven is writing is becoming real and that her and her son are in real danger.After two weak sequels back to back, this was a much needed entry to the series that provided a creative twist and new energy. I enjoyed the behind the scenes stuff on location at New Line Cinema and entering the ""reel"" homes of Englund and Craven. The dream sequences and death scenes are very sleek and clean, very 1994. It was all visually appealing and done well.It was so good seeing Heather Langenkamp again, even if she was playing herself and not Nancy for the most part. She is just as strong and likeable as a scream queen 10 years after the original. John Saxon reprises his role and plays himself, it was nice to see him again.New Nightmare is a wonderful addition to the series. I really liked the concept of a real life actors playing themselves in a movie the way that Craven did it. It deserved a much better reception at the box office, but likely suffered because of the time (horror wasn't all that popular in '94) and due to the weak 6th film. This one is highly recommended for it's creativity.8/10",New Nightmare
103,schroeder-gustavo,Doesn't get enough credit,8,6 June 2015,"If you're a fan of the series, you either hate New Nightmare or you love it. The idea behind this movie is amazing and everything just works perfectly. Much of the original cast is back and even Wes Craven himself is in it. I think the reason why a lot of people don't get this movie is because it kinda stays away from what the series became (cheesy, funny) and Craven created something a lot darker that many people didn't expect. So New Nightmare doesn't have any memorable Freddy kills. So what? The ideas of the movie are executed with amazing directorial precision and it is wildly entertaining. Also, this movie feels a lot more like a Scream movie than a Nightmare one, it could even be considered a prelude to Scream, one of my favorite horror movies, as both explore the idea of bringing horror movies to life. Also I found the many homages to the original fantastic, good job Wes Craven! You can also tell by many things in the movie and knowing what the director originally intended to do with the character of Freddy Krueger (before the studio made a few terrible cheesy sequels) that this was a passion project and Craven really gave this project his heart, and I respect that. The ending with the beautiful music, for example with Craven's note on the script thanking Heather for being Nancy one last time, nearly brought a tear to my eye. The last 20 minutes get a little out of hand and over the top, in my opinion, but in the end I will say Wes Craven's New Nightmare is an amazing piece of work and if you love the original and horror movies in general, please approach this with an open mind and I know you will enjoy it.

106,RickHarvey,Christina Aguilera once spoke for him.,7,6 October 2012,"Freddy is back... well, he's not actually back. Instead, an heinous and satanic Freddy takes over our screens as a his existence forges into reality while his films continue to dwindle in the publics conscious.(With the majority of the films being awful, i can't say that's a bad thing.) I really liked New nightmare: Original, showcasing the same mixture of intelligence with the first NMOES and most importantly, great acting. I was sceptical at first when knowing that a child actor stars - with them mostly being obnoxious and unwittingly annoying in majority of films - but thankfully the character of Dylan paid off.The thought of Freddy becoming closer to reality when the longer he's forgotten is fantastic. With the actors playing themselves, you follow the hysteria that follows Heather while he struggles to cope with a stalker. Freddy's appearance: Long, drab trench coat and feroda hat, is spot on. Despite a change in Freddy, it seems he can't resist on pulling out a one-liner from under his sleeves. Made his enigmatic aura suffer a little.Overall, I'm glad Craven decided to make another NMOES - even if it was just for the money. You sense his input being commanded with every shot. The final act gave lovers of the original NMOES an flash back on their initial experience with Freddy. With both script and camera, Craven didn't do much wrong.",New Nightmare

108,shaun98,Wes' return,7,22 August 2002,"If Wes Craven had known that ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" would have done so well, he might have put off selling the sequel rights and saved himself a lot of trouble. Alas, as it is, New Line milked its cash cow for all it was worth, giving the public more and more of the same, till the series descended into self-parody. The films hit a new low with the sixth film, ""Freddy's Dead,"" which completed the villain's transformation into a wisecracking cartoon character. In fact, there were moments when I wonder if they intentionally set out to make a comedy. In either case, it was a far cry from the semiserious original, which was genuinely scary at times. At that point, the decision was finally made to retire the series and kill off Freddy Krueger for good. And so it was done, but such a weak sendoff for a horror icon did not do the character justice. Something had to be done to take care of this nagging issue, but what? Wes Craven had the answer: he'd direct the seventh film, only this time, the actors would play themselves, and the villain would not be a resurrected Freddy, but a demon assuming his form, merely one of many it has taken over the centuries. This is indeed a successor to the original, but in a different continuity altogether.It's a clever conceit, one that only Wes could have pulled off. In a way, it's a warm-up for ""Scream,"" which took the self-referential approach a step further. Given that this is the sixth follow-up to a popular horror movie, it has turned out reasonably well, despite a somewhat uneven script. During the first third, I was a bit worried about how it was going to turn out. It does take a while to get going, but once it hits its stride, the thrills just keep on coming. Once assured that the film would deliver, I relaxed and enjoyed the ride. Wes hasn't lost his handle on suspense, it just keeps coming in spades. The blending of dreams, fantasy, and reality hasn't been handled this successfully since the original. Langenkamp is a better actress than many have given her credit for. Here, she's even better than she was in the original ""Nightmare."" It's hard to play yourself, but she does so quite well; never for a moment does it seem forced or awkward. Robert Englund plays himself as well as Freddy, proving that he doesn't need a ton of makeup to act. It's a shame that he's been typecast in the horror genre. Of course, Wes plays himself as well, though his acting isn't exactly inspired, so it was a wise move to stay on the other side of the camera for most of the game. Some of the producers of the ""Nightmare"" series appear as themselves as well. Milo Hughes and Fran Bennet offer solid supporting performances and Dyan and a concerned doctor, respectively. John Saxon also puts up an appearance.""New Nightmare"" is one of the few films that directly address the potential impact of horror movies on viewers, especially children. I certainly am not a censorship advocate, but nor do I believe that little kids should be exposed to explicit violence. Related scenes involving Heather Langenkamp's son Dylan could easily have been exploitive, but the filmmakers successfully avoid this pitfall, though they are still uncomfortable to watch (One is reminded of ""The Exorcist"" and ""Pet Sematary"") I thought of a statement made by a character in ""Scream:"" horror movies don't make psychos, they just make psychos more creative. I certainly hope that these cases are few and far in-between. *** (out of ****)Released by New Line Cinema",New Nightmare

111,boyinflares,The Princess of Horror Returns for the Definitive Nightmare,10,15 April 2006,"I've said it before, and I will say it again: Heather Langenkamp is the Princess of Horror, and once again she proves why. Whereas other horror heroines are blonde, sometimes ditsy, and needing frequent help, Langenkamp (either as herself or as Nancy) is resourceful, intelligent and you feel yourself really caring for her.Wes Craven and Heather Langenkamp return alongside Robert Englund's Freddy Krueger in what Craven himself calls ""The Definitive Nightmare"", and indeed, it is. So much goes on in the 7th Nightmare on Elm Street entry that it could be expected one might find it confusing and trivial, but the film is smart, eerie and outstandingly well done by all those involved.""New Nightmare"" essentially takes place in the real world, sometime after the Elm Street films have all ended. While the film only really references parts 1 and 3 (due to Langenkamp and Craven's involvement), it does nothing to contradict or negate what happened in parts 2 and 4-6, which is a very good thing. It just shows how much the people at New Line Cinema and the cast and crew involved in the Nightmare franchise care about and have respect for the films (and fans), and of the three major slasher franchises, would have to be the one that looks after the films the best.Playing herself, Heather Langenkamp is married to Chase (David Newsom) and together they have a son, Dylan (Miko Hughes), yet she is plagued by a strange caller. The film is so complex that I don't want to give away what happens, but Langenkamp ends up finding the evil entity that took the form of Freddy crossing over into reality now that the films are no longer being made. While this may sound complicated, it isn't, and the ""film within a film"" concept doesn't really apply here. The evil entity tries to get to Dylan, so Heather has to get to the source of what is going on, and Wes Craven (appearing as himself) explains about the entity to her, and suggests that she may have to ""play"" Nancy one last time. In an terrific finale, Heather / ""Nancy"" defeats Freddy and is able to rescue her son.""New Nightmare"" somewhat strays from the typical slasher-horror of the earlier films into a stylish new breed of horror that has yet to be matched. (The ""Scream"" franchise is another sub genre all together). While the film is incredibly long, it needs to be, as there is a lot to get through, and all the while Langenkamp doesn't miss a beat. It really is a shame she doesn't act much, though there is a reference to this in the film. (Watch out for the part where Englund is signing autographs to adoring fans by Langenkamp keeps her distance). The film also addresses the affects of horror on children, though only briefly, it would have been nice to delve into this further.There are few killings in the film also, another reason why it deviates from the typical slasher sub-genre, although two of the killings seem to pay homage to deaths in the earlier films - (Amanda Wyss in #1 and Danny Hassle in #5). Tracy Middendorf is a great example of what a supporting character should do - support as she plays Dylan's baby sitter. Fran Bennet is very good as Doctor Heffner.John Saxxon appears playing himself (he was Nancy's father in #1), Robert Englund plays both himself and Freddy, and as already mentioned, Wes appears also. Other important people at New Line Cinema also make brief but terrific performances: Robert Shaye, Sara Risher and Marianne Maddalena. Tuesday Knight (Kristen in #4) and Nick Corri also make very brief unspeaking cameos at a funeral. Lin Shaye (Robert's wife) appears once more (she has appeared in previous films) in a small role, and Craven's daughter Jessica has a role as a nurse - in fact, all the nurses are terrific.So, set aside some quality time to watch ""New Nightmare"" and watch Langenkamp prove why she is worthy of being called The Princess of Horror. This film is unmatched by all the Nightmare films - and that is saying a lot, as the Nightmare on Elm Street films are quality horror with an outstanding group of people overseeing them. Well done to all involved.",New Nightmare

Finally, feeling a need for some Freddy, I broke down and watched A Nightmare on Elm Street 7: The New Nightmare. This film introduces yet another twist into the Freddy franchise, this time Freddy comes to the real world, no, the real, real world. Freddy is angry about being killed off and terrorizes the cast of the original NOES. Except we have terror and very little Freddy. Freddy has always been the true star of the Elm St. series and Wes Craven attempts to create new horror with a monster we don't see. Unfortunately, we've already seen the monster and we want more, not less, of Freddy. To make matters worse, Heather Langenkamp lacks the acting chops to portray a horrified mother and can't sell the story. To top it off, Freddy's makeup, when he finally appears, is terrible. Freddy looks like a $90 Halloween mask. It's not all bad, especially for non-fans of the originals, there is some true horror here: fear of losing a child, fear of what your child may become, fear of losing of a parent, fear of the establishment/government. Ultimately it's a mediocre horror movie but not a good Freddy movie.",New Nightmare

This goes back to Bela ""Dracula"" Lugosi & just horror in general.If Part 6 was too comedic, this makes up for it.

115,jed-estes,Best of The Nightmare movies,10,29 September 2006,"I will go out on a long, long limb here and say that Wes Craven's New Nightmare is the best of the series. That said you should at least watch the first one before you watch this because it will help a lot to tell you what is going on in this film, but that is why I love this movie more than the other Nightmares and more than I do most horror films because it does not cater to stupid people who are not fans of horror. you really can't get much enjoyment out of this movie unless your a fan of the series and have done background checks on things behind the scenes in this series as this film comments on all that. It is not a date movie unless your a heavy fan of the series. I believe that is why many people do not like this movie. There just too ignorant to go back and see what took place before and understand the comments that this movie has to make about the series as a whole. I also believe that is why critics love this movie even though I hate critics, it is because for the last decade they had been put through the whole saga and did not like it, but when this fresh thing came along they were blown away and saw it for what it is. That's about the only way this film could mean anything to those horror bas hers. I also do know that some people will read this and say but Nightmare 7 does not make any reference to the past and it's like H-2-0 that way. Not true, H-2-O was made to make stupid people who had not followed the series from the 70's feel good about themselves and degrade the fans, thus it's wide appeal and the fact that now we are completely inundated with crap for horror movies these days, minus Saw and Eli Roth with Rob Zombie. New Nightmare however was done as a favor to the fans to show that New LIne cares and knows that Freddy is there bread and butter. That is why this film has only a limited appeal and the reason that this movie almost did not turn a profit.With that all said I will go into why this movie rules, Heather Langenkamp, John Saxon, Wes Craven, and the immortal Robert Englund are the reason this movie is the best it can be. Had a single one of them not returned this movie may have turned to crap, put with them back together again and in good form, especially since Englund had had a couple of years away from the character, thank god, they were able to pull off the best retrospective comeback ever, even better than the long gestated Freddy vs Jason ten years later. Watch this movie and marvel at it's beauty.",New Nightmare

Wes Craven has brought back the freddy from the first and brought him back to the big screen. in all the sequels freddy reid to be funny to much, in the original and New Nightmare Freddy is evil, he wants to kill which it should have been the whole way through. The story is Heather is an actress happily married, she has a little child Dylan She is worried about a maniac who is ringing frequently at her house. She think the maniac is Freddy the killer of her previous film Meanwhile Wes Craven is having some nightmares and inspired by that events he is writing the script for a new Nightmare series film. Heather is scared by some murders and by the schizophrenia of her son. The only way left to save her son is to act for the last time the part of Nancy to defeat Freddy forever.

118,BlueSkies765,Lives up to its name,7,2 May 2019,"This movie does feel like a nightmare. There isn't subtle creepiness but straight up a horrific nightmare with the infamous bogeyman Freddy Krueger terrorizing a family.I've watched Freddy vs Jason and the 2010 Nightmare on Elm Street version. The other versions I haven´t watched so far. This is the first real (for a lack of a better word) Nightmare on Elm Street movie I've watched. I knew it was going to be good because legendary director Wes Craven made it. So far I haven't watched a Wes Craven movie I didn't like. As a matter of fact People Under The Stairs is one of my all time favorite horror movies.I normally don't watch many movies with grotesque violence. New Nightmare is very violent but it's to be expected with this title. What this movie does right is make you feel the terror Heather and her son are experiencing. You feel the desperation of a mother being pulled into a world of madness with no real hope and understanding of whats going on. That atmosphere really gets to you.The scenarios in the dreams are bizarre, surreal things you would only see in a dream. Also the plot in itself is clever and therefore it avoids being cliché.Recommended for horror movie fans.",New Nightmare
119,Derek237,Makes up for the bad sequels,9,2 August 2003,"The First Nightmare on Elm Street was scary and original. It had the great idea of a killer killing people in their dreams. All of its sequels (except for part 2, which went in a horrible direction) just built on to that idea, and the idea wasn't scary anymore as the series progressed. Now with New Nightmare, Wes Craven came up with another original idea. It turns out that Freddy is in fact real, some kind of ancient evil that took the form of Freddy Krueger and could only be contained through storytelling, IE: the Nightmare On Elm Street movies. But since the series has ended, the genie is out of the bottle, and this ingenious film unravels.I wouldn't say this movie is that scary, it's more creepy than it is scary, but I love its imagination. It plays mind little mind games and you wonder what is real and what is not. Freddy Krueger is even credited as ""himself"". It's a must-see for any Freddy fan and in many ways it stands on its own...but only if you've seen the other movies. If that makes any sense.This is one of the best sequels in the Nightmare series and it's nothing short of brilliant. It's nice to see that Freddy is back in the bottle where he belongs, and hopefully will be for a long time...My Rating: 9/10",New Nightmare

121,The-Social-Introvert,Quickie Review: Wes Craven's New Nightmare,7,26 April 2016,"As we got more and more Elm Street moves, the series got more and more tired. It was the exact same formula, aside from maybe part 2, which had really run out of steam long before it ever got off the tracks. Shame really, because the original movie has a really clever and unique premise, and is executed to devastating effect. Returning to the franchise, Wes Craven presents a story where all the actors and crew members (including Heather, Langerkamp, Robert Englund and Crave himself) are involved in a new Elm Street movie production when strange things begin happening and, eventually, old pizza-face pops up for real. It's a pretty brilliant Meta idea, which must have served as some kind of beta for Craven's eventual Scream movies. The way the film is paced, the way the camera focuses on all the right details for all the right amount of timeyou can really tell a man of real talent is behind the movie's production. It's not loud and flashy like all of the Elm Street sequels – not until the end at least. Instead a more methodical and immersive approach is taken. In fact, a great deal of the film's best parts are amore about post- traumatic stress and dealing with alleged mental illnesses. Other things are touched upon, like the effects of horror movies on children and celebrity life. The 'real' Kruger does not show up properly until the last half hour or so. This works to the film's advantage, as the preceding runtime is used to flesh out the two main characters who ultimately will have to do battle with Kruger in the climax. Even before we see Freddy, the film's atmosphere is creepy and there are a couple of good scares. It's a far cry from the tired formula of 'introduce teenskill first teen in dream sequencekill second teen in dream sequence' etc etc. I was really digging Freddy's cool new look, with his long overcoat. The face was far more sinister than the previous two films, although at times it was too obvious that it was a mask.The characterization of this new, real Kruger made for refreshing story-telling. Technically, we've never seen this guy before, since he is the real deal who has managed to cross the dream and movie world into reality. Gone are the wise cracks and one lines. Craven does well to ensure that this Freddy is not someone we are supposed to be rooting for by making him sinisterly bump off innocent characters and go after a small child, without winking at the audience every two minutes. Credit to Craven for managing to give the character menace and a real fear factor once again. Most of the murders homage scenes from the original. Saying that, there aren't many deaths in the movie but since each is given a fair do's it's not a problem. Oh and in Elm Street tradition, Freddy himself also snuffs it once again, although this is one of the movie's poorer scenes due to some hokey special effects. Another less than perfect scene was the child being lifted up by Kruger's claws on the highway. That felt more like something out of the Elm Street sequels this film - which otherwise aims to be better, different and respectful of the original, and achieves all three targets. Best Offer: Hmm, what to choose? I like the film as a whole but no individual scene really sticks out. I think I'll go for the part where Kruger takes out the babysitter.",New Nightmare
122,R_O_U_S,Postmodern joy,9,26 January 2004,"So many 80s horror films leave me totally unmoved.  I sat through the debuts of Michael Myers, Jason Vorhees and Fred Krueger fairly dispassionately. But when, in 1994, Craven returned to his franchise and dissected it on a postmodern autopsy table, I was hooked.  In a confusing twist, it is now Heather Langenkamp, the genuine actress who appeared in A Nightmare On Elm Street, who is being stalked by Freddy Krueger - and his sights are also set on Robert Englund and Wes Craven!  Way ahead of its time, this paved the way for the nowhere-near-as-clever postmodern movies we sigh through today.",New Nightmare
123,scott-sw,Very underrated as a horror movie. A real gem.,9,31 October 2007,"This is Wes Craven as his best. He redeems his Nightmare on Elm Street creation by going back to the original Freddy Kruger ... ""darker, meaner"" as described by Robert Englund. Apparently, the actors and tech people of the Nightmare on Elm Street series are having Freddy nightmares--even Robert Englund. He's real, and he's trying to get out into our world. This movie will play with your mind and leave you guessing and gasping for breath. The movie does well on several levels. At the basic core is an interesting premise, and a very good script (something lacking in The People Under the Stairs). The idea of a movie concept turning on the people involved is interesting, and it opens up many questions. Pay close attention and see appearances by many of the original cast members of the original Nightmare. Also notice several scenes of the original repeated with new life and terror. Another strength was the outstanding performances. Heather Langenkamp shows depth as a concerned mother. Robert Englund and Wes Craven get to be themselves. John Saxon, usually a ""B"" movie actor, even gives credibility to his acting credentials as a concerned friend (or is that himself?). The best performance comes form young Miko Hughes, who plays Heather's seven-year-old son, Dylan. Another strength for the movie is that it is set in the real world. One disturbing strength is the outstanding direction which confuses the audience between nightmares and reality. It seems many people have condemned horror movies as nadir entertainment. Friday the 13th, and the Halloween Sequels really influenced the Nightmare on Elm Street Series in this fashion because it was ""B"" horror dealing with sexually active teenagers. Wes Craven's New Nightmare, however, ranks as serious effort that belongs with The Exorcist, Dawn of the Dead, and The Ring. Craven handles childhood fears, the mother-son relationship, and the worship of an anti-hero, Freddy Kruger. In the end, though, he is able to draw more sympathy and compassion for the heroine. He also deftly uses this script as a way to retell the tale of Hansel and Gretel. I'd rank this as one of the top three horror movies of all time. It is definitely underrated. So watch it with the lights off ... but don't ... fall ... asleep.",New Nightmare

125,boondocksaint20,Very original story and great acting are the highlights to this mediocre horror sequel,7,25 October 2003,"Now, don't get me wrong, I did like New Nightmare and especially so when compared to most of the crappy sequels to NOES.  It has a very original, inteligent and fresh story (kind of a story within a story), and excellent acting from the cast.  I wish Heather Langencamp would star in more films because from her effort in this film, she really pulls off what could have been a truly embarassing effort for the sixth sequel in a dying franchise.
All of the leads do good, except, and I know I'm in the minority here, the little boy who plays her tormented son.  This annoying kid was in practically every movie during the early 1990's that Macauley Culkin was not in that required a child actor to ham it up big time...and that he does in this film.  Now, there are moments where the kids looks genuinely freaked out, by overall, in my opinion, the boy's horrible acting and unbelievably unrealistic stoic representation of a five year old kid really puts a damper on an overall really good story.  Seriously, every time I saw that kid on screen I really had to fight back guilty desires of Freddy going to town on him...but at any rate, the other actors work well, especially Wes Craven's cameo as himself.The script within a script idea along with having many of the original actors return was an excellent idea for this movie, and really makes it enjoyable to watch.  However, as a horror movie, it fails miserably.  I'm not saying it's not in the least bit scary, but few of the scares work because they are either lame, or retreading practically the same territory and setups we've seen in the other 6 Nightmare films.  At least that was my impression, I know others thought this movie was truly terrifying, and to each their own...but what could (and SHOULD have been) a truly terrifying movie with a 'real life' Freddy Kruger truly fails when it comes to horror. And it especially sucks considering that the story is so damn good.  It's basically like watching a drama more than a horror film which may be fine for most, but if you're expecting a horror movie, you may be in for a real disapointment.  With such a damn good script and great atmosphere, you would imagine Freddy would be twice as terrifying as before...unfortunately it is not so in this case.  Freddy is portrayed now as a bumbling, goofy, obviously SYNTHETIC (yes, his makeup here is the worst I've seen in the whole series, and that's saying a lot considering some of the sequels) and very weak being who really poses as no huge threat during any of the 'Freddy vs. Heather' scenes.  The scenes of Freddy's lair are impressive, but the 'special effects' used on him in these scenes are almost embarassing to watch.  Trust me, you'll know it when you see it.Overall though, not a bad movie.  As a horror film, it has a wonderful plot and for the most part, outstanding acting (which in itself, is a rarity), but for being a horror film, it fails miserably.  This is the confliction with 'New Nightmare'...it actually focuses on the story unlike most other horror films...yet, fails most of the time to deliver with the scares.  To further testimony this, I watched this with a few people who literally jump at any scary movie moment, and only jumped maybe twice the whole time.  At any rate, it is a pretty good movie and a nice attempt of Craven's to inject life into a dying series.  However, if you're looking to be scared out of your wits, you may need to go ahead and rerent the original.  7/10 stars overall.",New Nightmare
126,arturmachado-29588,Freddy's back!,6,1 September 2017,"Wes Craven returns as a director/writer/actor in this film and saves the franchise, restoring the respect and fear to Freddy Krueger as in the first film.The idea for the plot is quite clever: Heather, the real-life actress who plays Nancy in the first movie, now (fictionally) married and with a 6 year old son, starts having nightmares about Freddy, as well as her son. In turn, Wes Craven is preparing a new plot for a new movie with Freddy, based on the belief that his own nightmares tell him that a demonic force uses the Freddy icon to break free in the real world and that the only way to preventing it is by having Heather to interpret Nancy again and fight it back into the underworld to which it belongs, or in other words, put the genie back in the bottle.Some of the killings were a repetition of previous movies, so it lacks a bit imagination on that department. The only other thing that could improve this movie would be a confrontation between the actor Robert Englund (Freddy Krueger) and 'the' Freddy Krueger. Freddy in this film is actually more threatening and scary, not playing so much with his victims as in the first movie with the evil jokes, which makes him a much more direct and imminent threat.To me, the first ""Nightmare"" and this, both by Wes Craven, are really the only worthy ones.",New Nightmare

130,samgiannn,New Nightmare (1994),6,1 May 2016,"I've heard this called the best Nightmare on Elm Street sequel and some have even called it better than the original Nightmare film. I can't say it's any of those things, but New Nightmare is one of the better movie in one of my favorite horror movie franchises and a refreshing entry after the abysmal Freddy's Dead. New Nightmare departs from Springwood, Ohio and instead takes place in the ""real"" world. Heather Langenkamp, the actress who played Nancy in the original film, is now a married mother, and she is contacted by Wes Craven to be in the definitive final Nightmare on Elm Street film. However, Heather has been having increasingly terrifying nightmares and phone calls that sound suspiciously like the films' iconic villain, Freddy Krueger. Her son's disturbing behavior also leads her to believe that the script that Wes is writing may not be just another movie. Arguably the best part about New Nightmare is all the nods and winks to the original film sprinkled in there. The phone gag from the first one is in there (which I admit still scared the crap out of me), and a majority of the deaths are reminiscent of other deaths in the series, particularly Tina's infamous death from the first movie and the motorcycle kill from The Dream Child. Wes Craven and Robert Englund also make cameo appearances in the film, although their subplots just sort of fizzle out towards the end. I also wasn't a big fan of Freddy trying to get a hold of Heather's son. The ""creepy kid"" scenes didn't really unsettle me and instead came off as hammy. But Wes obviously had a lot of fun with New Nightmare and ended the series with a clever take on the slasher film that would be replicated in the future with flops like Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2. Personally, the criminally underrated The Dream Master will always be my favorite Nightmare sequel, but New Nightmare is a fun and sporadically scary slasher flick.",New Nightmare
131,briandwillis-83825,The Best Sequel,9,22 October 2020,"Whip smart and clever, New Nightmare reinvents what a horror movie sequel can be by going meta and having the cast and crew of the Nightmare series haunted by a demon who's upset they're no longer making movies about Freddy Krueger. This Freddy is lean and mean and has no time for wisecracks. The finale might get a little over the top and fantastical for some, but I found it very exciting.",New Nightmare

This movie came no where near to being as good as the original one, this movie wasnt even better than part 2 well I wont call it that bad but basically this movie was lacking alot and I was really bored watching it, this is the reason I guess Wes Craven gave up on the nightmare series and no other nightmare movies were made after this besides the remake in 2010.",New Nightmare

""Wes Craven's New Nightmare"" just doesn't do justice to the series.  For the most part IT'S NOT SCARY.  The script has Freddie coming to ""real life"" and chasing the ""real life"" people who are close to the ""real life"" actress (Heather Langenkamp) who was in some of the movies.Heather Langenkamp, Wes Craven, Robert Englund, John Saxon and others all play themselves.  The real actress Heather, sits down and discusses the script with Wes Craven.  It just comes across as poorly conceived.  And it's NOT scary.  As I said, New Nightmare (1994) doesn't do justice to the real series.",New Nightmare
134,Spooky2001,A Worthy Film,8,30 October 2002,This is an interesting movie.  I like the idea that the Freddy movies were like a cover-up for an evil entity like Freddy.

135,PlayerSS,One of the best of the series!,7,31 January 2003,"This movie really buried the 6th part of the series. Wes Craven made the series back into what it was supposed to be in the first place HORROR.

Still not quite as many deaths as I wanted, but you take what you can get in a situation like this. The death that the movie did produce was still creative. I couldn't quite get used to the Freddy as a demon thing.SPOILERS STOPPEDPretty much one of the best in the series besides the first. Craven out did himself with this movie. All of the actors performed excellent. My rating 9/10",New Nightmare
136,Skeletors_Hood,"Great Story, Wes! Thanks!",8,27 September 2001,"Imaginative!  A great break, and a new breath into the series.  If you don't like this movie, then you probably hate imagination and reinvention, not to mention just plain old storytelling.It's a different Freddy, and that's what makes it good.  The previous movies needed help, with a couple of exceptions (namely 1,3, and 4, in my opinion). Slasher movies with numberous sequels seem to beat a dead dog a lot, but this Freddy broke his own mold.  He was scarier and more evil than the old Freddy.  I liked the description that Wes Craven gave in the movie about how it's an old evil that can only be captured by storytellers.  And that evil likes being Freddy.  Imagination!If you don't agree, let me point out that a lot of remake movies, which are plugged as ""reimagined"" aren't that much different.  Look at Planet of the Apes....just a newer twist, a re-look at the original.  New Nightmare is the same thing, except it twists the story, and actually pulls it from the context that it was written for, namely movies.  Wes Craven was obviously using a form of screenwriting that borrows from a form of playwrighting, in which the story itself involves the theater, actors and or characters.  I forget the technical term for this, but an example would include the play ""Noises Off,"" in which the play is about actors performing a play.  A movie example could include ""Shakespeare in Love"" as well.  Craven is doing the same thing by having the actors from earlier films play themselves, while talking about the characters that they portrayed.  The whole story revolves around Wes' script, the question being will Heather return as Nancy.  Not to mention, the story loops itself, beginning where it ended.  Folks, that's NOT a cop-out, nor are we being jipped.  It's storytelling, pure and simple.As far as the movie itself, there are some issues concerning make-up and the glove.  Just keep in mind, that it's a different Freddy, not the ""movie"" Freddy.Overall, one of the best of the series, and one of the most chilling.  To really enjoy it though, you must be able to suspend your disbelief,and don't look for the older Freddy.  Treat this as it's own movie.",New Nightmare

It's a nightmare to die for!

The idea is flawed as you will see.  If this were possible, we'd have a real King Kong, a real Godzilla, Frankenstein, Jaws, Darth Vader, ALIEN etc. walking around because numerous people were thinking of them.

Heather Langenkamp, Wes Craven, Robert England, and others play themselves. The concept of the movie is that an evil supernatural being was actually responsible for Wes Craven coming up with the Freddy Krueger character. After Freddy was killed for good in part six, that supernatural being began terrorizing Heather in her dreams and her husband and son. Heather ends up having to go into dreamland to save her son and kill the monster. This is a scary great movie.",New Nightmare
141,Cobbler,Even better than the original.,8,17 October 2000,"I would vote for this film (along with the much-maligned The Blair Witch Project)as the best horror film of the 1990s. There is an amazing tension that exists in each and every scene. It's horrible and indescribable, like something bad is about to happen, but the characters can't stop it. The post-modern aspect of the film is fascinating in itself, but more importantly, the horror scenes are actually SCARY, and Freddy has been given a new, tougher look (and biomechanical hand) which is really effective. Even the scene where Dylan climbs to the top of the jungle gym, reaching toward the sky, makes me jittery just thinking about it. The earthquakes and Hansel & Gretel references also were an interesting part of the movie for me. The first time I saw the film I had some qualms about the last 15 minutes, but upon further viewings, the last sequence fits the themes of the movie well, and it really does feel like a nightmare world. I would recommend this movie to fans of the series as well as serious students of film who haven't seen this, Wes Craven's best movie. 9/10.",New Nightmare
142,NpMoviez,"Should have been the best movie in the franchise, but it's not.",6,20 August 2021,"It's the meta-cinematic idea and the fact that ""Freddy Krueger"" was now a pure evil - more sadistic than he has ever been is what makes this movie good. The meta-cinematic idea is well done in Scream. To be honest, Scream is my most favorite slasher film ever. Here, the meta stuff is a bit raw, and creates some loop holes that are absurd. The fact that it's not really a Freddy movie, but a meta movie that's based on the first movie also makes it feel detached from the series. I think it's flawless story-wise and to a certain extent, writing-wise. The actors have done a great job. Also, it has many things taken from the original one. That's not a bad thing and have different implications here. The stakes are also high, but we don't feel the stakes are high or the urgency that the story demands. It's there, but we don't feel it. There's something lacking in the movie that doesn't compel us to get connected. So, it's not the story at all, not the writing, it's a well-directed movie with a perfect haunting tone, it has really terrifying moments that it's supposed to have. Except for some loop holes due to the meta style, it's a solid film. But still something went wrong and I couldn't feel it in the way I am supposed to and in the way it wants me to. Something definitely went wrong.According to my personal experience, it's characters which hold the movie down. Even though they're supposed to be ""real"" Heather Langenkamp and Robert Englund, they are characters in the movie. We barely know them as characters, and the movie basically assumes that we should care about them just because they're the stars of the original movie. So, they're not the same characters in the first one and they're also not the characters we can care about. That's what went wrong. We don't know them personally. Had we known the actors personally, there would've been no problem at all. It would be more terrifying than it was supposed to be. But we don't know them. They should've been introduced as characters in the movie interestingly. They're not Nancy and Freddy. They're Heather and Robert. Heather and Robert are stars of the first one. What else do we know about them? Nothing much. So, why should we care? I am not saying that thry should've shown us stuffs about their real personal life, in fact, I don't care about that at all. But, if they're characters of a movie, treat them like characters. Make a completely fictional story depicting their real life, but at least let us know them properly as movie characters so that we can care about them. The reason Scream worked isn't only the great storytelling, gripping storyline and thrills. It had really great characters. This movie is a perfect example that characters are needed in a movie, no matter how good the storyline is and no matter how excellent the storytelling is.It's actually a very well made and a very well written movie. I don't hate the movie. I like it for what it is. I appreciate the effort. But it's not the best movie ever. It should have been though.Rating : 6.6/10.",New Nightmare

Even Robert Englund, who plays himself in this one along with Heather Lagenkamp, John Saxon, and Wes Craven, fears the ""scarier"" Freddy in his nightmares.

148,Speechless,Flawed but surprisingly good,8,13 March 2001,"I'm amazed at what Wes Craven manages to pull off in this movie.  By setting the movie in the real world, Craven manages to acknowledge the validity of all the awful Elm Street sequels, while at the same time freeing himself from their constraints.  He brings back a character who was supposedly dead, without making it feel cheesy or contrived (cough cough Superman cough). And underneath all of that, he gives us an atmospheric and riveting horror film.There are two main problems with the movie.  The most damaging is its length and pacing.  It goes on for a very long time without much action, and while it's great that the filmmakers try to establish a believable reality and give the characters some depth, they should have cut some of those unnecessary dialogue scenes.  The other problem is that the screenplay deals with some of its ideas very clumsily--Craven has to actually write himself into the story so that he can explain everything that's going on. 
But Wes Craven's New Nightmare is much better than the other sequels, and deserves a place in any horror fan's collection.  There should be more horror movies like this.",New Nightmare

I thought Scream was meta, but this went through the roof. It was done in a very clever way throughout, so it was done right.

150,mbworm,The series goes out with a bang... or does it?,8,7 January 2008,"Wes Craven's stylish slasher ""New Nightmare"" is no doubt the strongest follow-up in the ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" series. The series had started strong with the original but had started dying off, until it was lame and unoriginal by the sixth. But Wes Craven, the original director, returns to direct this horror extravaganza and saves the series satisfyingly.Heather Langenkamp plays herself here, now with a little boy (Miko Hughes from Pet Sematary) and a loving husband. The whole film is cleverly set in real life, with all of the actors playing themselves, including Wes Craven, who is directing a movie within the movie. It's a bit confusing determining what is real and what is not but the movie is smart and original in its approach.Freddy Krueger was killed off in the last movie, and now an ancient evil that was living through the films is finally free. Angry that Freddy is dead, it returns in his form and starts terrorizing Heather and her child. Imaginative and scary, this isn't as creepy as the original but it's not bad for a ""Nightmare"" film, certainly better than some of the abysmal previous installments. This isn't really the end of Freddy though, don't worry. He's right back to his old roots in the fantastic ""Freddy Vs. Jason"" after this.",New Nightmare

But in the case of this movie, it is not true. Because ""New Nightmare"" is not just a good horror - it is a great, almost poetic film about the thin line between fantasy and reality. The story is extremely original and interesting (minor spoilers lie ahead): Ancient demon is trapped in the character of Freddy Krueger in the Elm Street series. But after ""The Final Nightmare"" the demon, who is a darker version of Freddy Krueger is free and attacks ""the real world"". His aim is to kill the actress who played Nancy in the first part - Heather. To achieve this, Freddy tries to madden her small, 8-years old son. Heather must accept the unthinkable truth and to confront the vile creature. The movie is very good, with beautiful new vision, better special effects and a very good plot. Actors play very well, which is uncommon in horror movies and Freddy Krueger is much cooler in this film, than in the previous six parts.

153,Parks,Nice idea... shame about the execution...,6,7 June 2010,"Long before the critics started wetting themselves at post-modern, self-referential (and self-indulgent) shows like Extras and Arrested Development, Wes Craven beat them to it. His New Nightmare stars Heather Langenkamp and Robert Englund playing themselves in a movie within a movie written by Wes Craven playing himself writing the script as it unfolds. How Charlie Kaufman is that?It is a terrific idea, and has Heather discovering that she, Englund and Craven have accidentally provided an ancient evil with a portal into the real world in the fictional creation of Freddy Krueger. Now that the series of movies has ended, this entity has started invading her dreams as Freddy - and it thinks if it kills ""Nancy"" it will be unleashed for real.So that's the good news. The bad news is that once this premise has been laid out for the viewer, it's all downhill from there. Heather Langenkamp's acting hasn't improved with age, Wes Craven spends his time being ""mysterious"" (i.e. vague and annoying) and it's left to Robert Englund to save the day. Sadly, he's not in the movie as either himself or Freddy nearly enough.It gets worse. ""Real Freddy"" looks even more fake and rubbery than the 80's version, if that were possible, plus the main focus of the dreamtime incursions this time is Langenkamp's young son. Now I am against child actors at the best of times, but when this bug-eyed little squirt starts screaming and yelling about Freddy, you'll just want to give him a kick.The climax to the movie is pretty similar to every other film in the Nightmare series, which is somewhat disappointing. However, this film is almost worth it - almost - for the creepy sequence where Heather realises she's back in Elm Street for real. Still, New Nightmare is easily the best follow-up of the series, and way more imaginative than any slasher sequel has the right to be.",New Nightmare

Too bad because the premise was really intriguing and could have made a mind blowing film ( like Scream which followed ) . It is revealed that Freddy Krueger is a real ancient being which wants to come to real life so he starts stalking Heather Langencamb the actress who played Nancy in the first film and her son Dylan . The endless cameos from actors playing themselves and Robert Shaye and Wes Craven personally convince you that these things happen in the real world . So what went wrong you will ask.The script is basically a rehash from the first Nightmare , some scenes are directly stolen from there . On the top of that the kid that plays Dylan ( Miko Hudges ) is a lousy performer . He is SO irritating. I will have to admit that Heather plays very well and the direction isadequate ( especially in the earthquake scene ) . But that cannot make up for what has to be the worst script in history . This way too long dream - in a dream - in a dream scene in the hospital is unoriginalnot to mention the older than mud (!) line "" Julie , behind you !

158,forrestwrs,Best Freddy Krueger Movie Ever Made,9,12 September 2010,"Not only is this the best of all the Elm Street sequels, I would even go on to say that Wes Craven's New Nightmare is the best Freddy Krueger movie ever made. Period.Perhaps it's because this is the way Wes Craven truly wanted a Freddy Krueger movie to be treated. Perhaps it's because of the heightened characterizations the audience is treated to. Perhaps it's even because of the way the direction was handled in comparison to the other films. In any event, I even enjoyed New Nightmare over the first Nightmare On Elm Street movie.I'll start with the man himself, Freddy Krueger. As Robert Englund (the character) even says in the film, this is a darker, eviler Freddy than audiences have seen. His look is profoundly different and, in my opinion, he looks better than ever. This was the first time since the first movie I was able to take Krueger seriously. Oh, I enjoyed Englund's performance through nearly all the Elm Street movies, but here he adds a little bit of something that I haven't seen before.First of all, I want to point out to every horror writer and director out there that *this* is the way puns are to be used, if you choose to use them: as a precursor to something dark and sinister. Remember in the third film when Krueger asks ""Feeling tongue-tied?"" and wraps a boy in his (Freddy's) tongue? Not like that. Or in the last film when he says ""Nice hearing from you, Carlos"" after blowing up a kids head with sound waves? Not like that either. No, when Freddy asks the boy ""Do you want to see how to skin a cat?"" while gripping his babysitter's skin in his claw, that's how to do a pun. Perhaps it doesn't even count as a pun, I don't know (I wasn't sure if I got it anyway), but when Krueger said that, I got a very faint chill down my spine. That was pretty chilling.The way they treated Freddy here goes back to the good ol' days when Freddy had a bit of dignity and credibility in him. Throughout the film, Craven makes the incredibly wise decision of never showing Freddy's full body or even letting the audience in on what he's up to. Instead, we get a lot of shots of his claw piercing through materials and heading sinisterly toward a victim.This is indeed the most effective Freddy movie, hands down. And it's also the Freddy movie with the lowest body-count, I would like to point out. And I believe that's because every single death is given a very deep meaning and depth to it. At no point does a character die and not mentioned again. No, in New Nightmare, when a character dies, the audience has that death on their mind for the rest of the picture.And the music! The musical score in New Nightmare is better than even the first movie, and that is definitely saying something. I loved the soundtrack to this movie. Wes Craven, for the most part, did away with the rock songs that had been a large part of the soundtracks since the second or third movie.I also want to praise all of the performers in this film, especially Englund, as both himself and Krueger. And Heather Langenkamp as well. Always one of the best Final Girl performances of all time, she gives 100% in this new film, making her performance, above all else, believable. There is also a child actor who plays Langenkamp's son and he is one of the better child actors I have seen in a *long* time.There is also a very interesting side character in this film. I have already praised this film for its characterizations and I don't think anything shows that better than the nurse in this film. Her character is very interesting. Even though she acts like an antagonist or obstacle for Langenkamp for a majority of the picture, this is not a bad person. She is looking out for the best for both Langenkamp and her son. It is very difficult for the audience to side against this character when her desires are so sincere to see the characters come out of their ordeal alright, and I think that's what makes her a great character. This film is full of stuff like that.Wes Craven delivers the ultimate Nightmare movie in a way that only he could with Wes Craven's New Nightmare. It blends dreams with reality in a way audiences haven't seen since the first film and he treats all the characters in the story with the love and care that they have been lacking since nearly the start of the series. This was my favorite Nightmare of them all, and I don't think its greatness will be duplicated.9/10",New Nightmare
159,IheartCali5882,Depressing how bad this is =(,3,21 October 2010,"As a die-hard fan of Freddy Krueger, I tend to feel disappointment in these sequels more so I think than an objective viewer. A classic like the original Nightmare on Elm Street is very hard to beat I realize, and so I tend to go a little easier on subsequent installments. The third movie, Dream Warriors, was decent for the most part, if you give it A lot of leeway. Aside from that the franchise has gone steadily downhill; culminating in this crap fest Wes Craven's New Nightmare.Everything that worked in the original is absent in this new film (except for one thing and I'll get to that). There is no real thought given to the characters, I'm assuming since they are all playing themselves that Wes didn't feel the need to do so. The story earns one of it's 3 stars because of this. Wes has created a film about the film. Each of the characters are their real life selves, dealing with the after effects of being part of the Freddy Krueger phenomena. The central conflict explores the notion that the idea and essence of Freddy Krueger has fed on itself and become so big that he can't be contained on film, and once the exorcising effect of filming is ended, his spirit will seek to live eternally in actual life. It's a novel idea, I'll admit, but the execution is horrible. The script is so elementary as to be laughable, and most of the acting leaves MUCH to be desired.With the exception of 2 scenes, there are virtually no scary moments in the film. Or maybe there were and I was too busy trying not to nod off to notice. Most of the plot is idiotic and preposterous; and not even preposterous in a good over-the-top horror movie way. When trying to go for over the top, there's a very fine line between what can be seen as spectacular as what is simply seen as ridiculous. 95% of New Nightmare falls into the latter category.Finally I was thoroughly annoyed by the fact that Wes had changed Freddy so drastically for apparently arbitrary reasons. Even down to the makeup and contacts, Freddy has gotten a makeover. I'm not at all happy about it. He still retains his striped sweater, although it looks as if he went and bought a replacement at Macy's. To go with his snazzy new sweater, there's a long leather trench coat, tight black leather pants, and Doc Martin combats boots (knee length to be exact). The glove is gone and in it's place is what is supposed to be a skinless hand with fake looking tendons and sinewy muscles, from which protrude the customary blades.There are not many redeeming qualities in this film. It started out weak and ended with some unbelievably bad sequences in some hellish netherworld; all I remember are long tongues, even longer arms, and maybe an electric eel. It was so bad that I did laugh a few times during the finale. Not a good laugh, a laugh because I couldn't believe how low the film had gotten.I gave it another star for an awesome death scene involving a character in a hospital room; a direct homage to the original (see parentheses above). Now that was actually worth watching. Too bad the whole film couldn't share this kind of intensity and excitement.The third star was out of sheer pity.",New Nightmare

The scene when the babysitter gets dragged and killed on the ceiling at the hospital gave me nightmares for weeks when i was little. This movie was creative,original ,creepy as hell and is the best one out of the series if you ask me. Bravo and RIP to one of the horror gods Wes Craven. This movie will always be on my list as one of the best.",New Nightmare
161,howellgirl2011,Freddy wants to be in the real world but can Nancy stop him before it's too late?,10,13 January 2011,"He's back and more evil than ever, this time a demon force has taken over the form of Freddy and loves it but wants Heather to play the character Nancy one last time for a play that has her character in it. The idea of the film reflects the original film and shows that Freddy is truly evil and will do whatever it takes to get into our world. Heather's character Nancy had defeated him in the first film but in the third film she was killed but he could not get into our world due to her holding him at bay in the dream world. But when Freddy had kidnapped her son Dylan, she had no choice but to play Nancy and defeat him once and for all. But Dylan had to help her when Freddy had her tongue-tied and was enjoying it(Freddy had his tongue tied around Heather all over her body and was enjoying it) until Dylan had stabbed his tongue with a kitchen knife Heather had brought with her. I had really enjoyed this film so much that I had watched it over and over and over again, that is how much I love Freddy and how he really can kill someone in a fun way but this film had not much humor in it.",New Nightmare
162,verrucktcarlos,Loved it,8,21 June 2020,"In a perfect world this is the 3rd and final a nightmare on elm street movie after the first one and Dream Warriors. I loved the concept for this movie, it is one of the most interesting ones I've ever seen.Here they really cut down on Freddy's comical side and go full menacing, that makes total sense since this is supposed to be real world's Freddy. His design is very different, I love what they did with it, and how now he doesn't have a glove but rather his knives come out of his actual hand, super clever since again, this is the real one.Very entertaining to see Heather and Robert interact with eachother, the interview scene was really well made. But I wish they would have used Robert more, since he plays Freddy, he isn't in it that much, there's a part where they show he is painting a Freddy-esque picture and then don't show it or reference it anymore, what was that all about?And Freddy doesn't show up that much until the very end, I get that since at the beginning he really isn't all there but rather his ''essence'', anyhow, not enough Freddy. But when he finally appears it is amazing, his introduction is actually the best one in this series, that ''miss me?'' part was phenomenal.And the ending was super clever and well made. To have Heather become Nancy was super cool, to see her trapped in the ''movie'' world was very interesting, and I wish that would have been longer, to cut down on the hospital scenes and to have the Elm Street world last longer.The last fight was good, could have been a lot better, I like the whole underworld thing, but Freddy does some very cartoonish things like that tongue thing, that wasn't scary at all, and the final reveal looked kinda funny.My favorite Nightmare sequel, a few flaws here and there but nothing that messes the movie up.",New Nightmare
163,kayrannells,One Craven's Most Genius Films,9,13 October 2020,"After New Line Cinema has effectively killed Freddy off in their final sequel, the spirit from which he was channeled gets angry and goes after the members of the cast and crew involved with the making of the Nightmare on Elm Street films, trying to get them to sign on to make another film.Wes Craven creates one of the smarter and most innovative sequels in the franchise and, as of this date, it remains a perfect ending to the franchise and a great bookend in Craven's career right before he went on to reinvent horror again with Scream. Sometimes, it seems as if he's bitten off more than he can chew, but that was always the great part about Craven. At least he had the guts to take a bite that big and really explore some deeper themes about humanity. New Nightmare might overestimate itself a few times, but it has a lot more interesting things on its mind than a lot of other films of this type.",New Nightmare

I love him since I was a a child... I was sneaking and watching this movie, we had it on tape!! This is one of the worst Nightmares on Elm Street movie sequels if not the worst. Where to start... There is nothing scary at all! It's just so stupid, even the acting looks cheap.But honestly the worst thing of all is Freddys mask. Like COME ON, he looks like a cartoon!! So so so not scary and so not real! The original idea is so amazing it has potential to go so deep and so far! I wish they just used it better. I always hated the ""funny "" part of those movies.. This should be SCARY and scary only! You've created one of the scariest characters ever, keep it that way. Third movie is still the most serious, most mature, the SCARIEST!! Every other movie has it's good and bad sides, such as Freddys hand stretching.. I hated it. Looks CHEAP and so not scary!! I'm really looking forward to see remake.. The only thing I'm worried about is another actor as Freddy... Robert was simply so amazing, and he looks scary without the mask. His shoes will be very hard to fill.",New Nightmare
165,nickzbekool,A spark of originality in the series,10,15 August 2020,"Wes Craven was a genius and this film goes along the same lines as ""Scream"" with it's tongue in cheek approach to the genre. Heather Lagenkamp plays herself but is pulled into pulling Nancy one more time when she discovers Freddy is real and trying to possess her young son Dylan. Countless deaths and tragedies ensue making her realize this will be a final fight to save herself and her son from Freddy who is stronger and more menacing than ever. Such a good sequel and blurs the lines between movie and reality with actors playing themselves and their movie counterparts. And Freddy no longer the funny Freddy we know is more evil than ever before. Scary, smart and a lot of fun!",New Nightmare

Some of the actors from the movies series play themselves in the movie, such as John Saxon, Robert Englund, & Heather Langencamp. Wes Craven also plays himself in the movie. The plot: Wes Craven has written a script for the new Freddy movie, but there's a problem...the script has come to life. A very interesting turn in the last installment of the series...or is it? There's still the Jason vs. Freddy movie coming out...but if you are a fan of the Freddy movies, check 'The New Nightmare' out. It's great.",New Nightmare
167,cwillis_m,Wes Craven's Best!,10,28 May 2003,"I first saw ""Wes Craven's New Nightmare"" before I even saw the original ""Nightmare on Elm Street."" This movie was the reason why I went back and watched the original. The original is good, but overall, I feel that ""New Nightmare"" is the best movie Wes Craven has made (I will say it's probably better to watch the original one before this), and one of the best horror films I've seen. In this movie, Freddy has had a make over, he's dressed differently (which seems to have bothered some people) and much more menacing than he was in the previous films. The idea of the ""real"" Freddy coming out and trying to kill the actors from the original is so original and great, it makes the movie a rare recent horror gem. My rating: 10/10",New Nightmare
168,Movieguy-47,A Genuinely Great Movie,10,30 July 1999,"It would've taken some push, but if ""Wes Craven's New Nightmare"" had gotten the word-of-mouth credit it deserved, it would've been a horror movie sensation. It's a good horror film and a good film; with those two combined, I personally thought ""New Nightmare"" was a genuinely great movie.Topically, it's a movie within a movie about a movie, and it's also pretty necessary that you've seen a few (or at least the first) ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" movie. It turns out, Freddy Krueger was sort of a created film entity that was protecting the world from a great demonic force. Now this force has taken on the person of a real-life Freddy, who haunts the dreams of former cast members, mainly Heather Langenkamp (who plays herself), who played Nancy in the first ""Elm Street"" movie. Writer-director Wes Craven ALSO plays himself, as he tries frantically to write a new script for the supposedly ""dead"" movie series, and Robert Englund plays himself AS WELL as Freddy Krueger.Sounds confusing? Like I said earlier, you have to at least have some knowledge of the ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" movie to really comprehend this one. Still, as it gets more and more complicated, ""Wes Craven's New Nightmare"" gets more and more interesting, and it's always highly entertaining. I'm not a big horror movie fan, but, frankly, I loved this one. Rated R. 112 minutes. 10 out of 10.",New Nightmare
169,andrew_popa,Wes Craven's best film to date !,8,8 July 2000,"This movie is much better than the first Nightmare On Elm Street.Wes Craven (the creator of Freddy Kruger) does a scary movie (but very good), using the real actors, even Wes stars in this movie as Wes Craven , Robert Englund as Robert Englund.

171,RebelXStar,"When the time comes, you're gonna have to make a choice; whether or not you're willing to play Nancy one last time...",7,29 September 2016,"In 1984, acclaimed horror director Wes Craven breathed new life into the slasher genre with 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' and then again in the mid-nineties with 'Scream', a cool, edgy (for the time) meta-horror. But before there was 'Scream', Craven had already ventured into meta territory with 'New Nightmare.'The actress who played Nancy, Freddy's adversary from the first and third 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' movies, Heather Langenkamp plays a fictionalised version of herself raising a son, Dylan with her special effects technician husband, Chase.Heather begins to experience nightmares, including one where Chase is attacked and killed on the set of a new 'Nightmare' movie by a Freddy glove come to life. She is also dealing with a real-life stalker who likes to mimic Freddy's mannerisms and struggling to shield Dylan from her work as a horror movie actress.Whilst doing publicity for the tenth anniversary of 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' she learns that there is indeed another movie in the works and Chase has already been working on special effects for it without her knowledge. The production company want her to star in the movie but she is reluctant.However, when Chase is killed in a car accident and his body is found with deep claw marks in his chest and Dylan's behaviour becomes increasingly unstable, including becoming convinced that a man is trying to come up from the foot of the bed while he sleeps to attempting suicide in the playground, Heather turns to her 'Nightmare' co-workers for help and support.From Wes she learns that the script he's writing is eerily similar to the current events in her life, but is real-life inspiring the script or is the script dictating real-life?After 'Freddy's Dead' gave Freddy a damp squib of a send-off, 'New Nightmare' was a welcome entry to the series. And even though the ending is still somewhat anti-climatic and Robert Englund is very underused (there should have been more interaction between him and the 'new' Freddy - what a missed opportunity!) this is still the vastly superior 'final' movie that is both enjoyable and original.",New Nightmare
172,jmcgee321,The Best NIGHTMARE Of All!!!!,10,17 April 2005,"Now I was and still am a strong fan/supporter of the NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET franchise. I've stayed with it even as FREDDY(Robert Englund) became a wisecracker. When I heard Wes Craven was going to make the new and last one of series, I was fabler-casted. This is a way I think all horror series should be put to the end if needed. The Best NIGHTMARE of all!!!!FREDDY KRUGER has terrorized almost everybody in the world.... with his movies and fame shooting around throughout the world. In the real world, real life actress Heather Langenkamp and actor Robert England are somewhat sick of their know roles; well Heather mainly. Wes is writing a new script to end the series for good. But something strange is happening, something un-natural, unexplainable. The reel FREDDY is trying to get to the real world. This FREDDY is more evil, darker, twisted, scarier, and above all else, serious. He is also terrorizing Heather's son Dylan(Miko Hughes).This is a truly scary movie that knows how to reach a nerve. The absolute best NIGHTMARE in the NIGHTMARE series. Robert still shines as FREDDY, giving him a new attitude, but also as himself. Heather is still beautiful and you can tell she really grow up. Miko's role is creepy and brilliant, the best child actor in a horror film since Linda Blair in the EXCORIST. Which reminds me, this is an adult horror film, not like those teenage slasher films. This centers on real adults and how they handle these problems. They should make more films like this. If enjoyed this I recommend these other grown up horror movies: THE EXCORIST, SESSION 9, WEINDEGO, CANDYMAN, a all M. Night Shyamalan's movies.",New Nightmare
173,Jodie-4,Craven at his best.,8,2 February 1999,"Just when you think Freddy has gotten as boring and predictable as he could possibly be, Wes Craven throws a curve ball that rejuvenates the series. This was perhaps the first original idea to find its way into a slasher flick in some time. And although I must remain loyal to the original, this was definitely the scariest of all the nightmare movies. The previous sequels resorted to cheap gore tactics, where as this one is more frightening psychologically than anything else. And kudos to Miko Hughes, who definitely wins the prize for ""best child actor in a mentally questionable role""- could the casting be any better?",New Nightmare
174,troutman,The best of the sequels,9,4 February 1999,"The only real problem with Wes Craven's New Nightmare is that it is not very scary. However as a drama it works well and it is certainly the best Nightmare on Elm Street film since the first.The thing that saves the film's lack of scares is the fact that the actors work well to create a really creepy tone that goes right through the film. Wes has worked out that the films where better when Freddy was a supporting character and that the main focus should be on the people who are affected by the actions of the killer.Heather Langenkamp is good though Robert Englund tends to overact, the child playing Heather's kid gives a better performance than he does.The film within a film angle pulls the series out of the mess created by Freddy's Dead a film that if there was any justice would have gone straight to video as it did not deserve a cinema release.Overall this is a really good film that was way better than any Part 7 could have expected to be. I just hope that it is not ruined by Freddy Vs Jason.",New Nightmare
175,ajohns1,Best of the series,7,27 July 2003,This is by far the best in the series its the most original picture I've ever seen really . But it does lack on gore in witch nowadays is the most important thing in a horror movie. But the idea of putting the creators in the movie really benefit the movie. The only real complaint I have is the final showdown freddy was less than scary trying to eat Miko hughes it just wasn't scary it was almost funny maybe rethink the final showdown put lots more blood in it and you got the ideal horror film. For someone who doesn't really like the nightmare on elm street series there is still plenty of entertainment in this one. 8/10 Still very good best of the series,New Nightmare
176,Was-it-All-a-Dream,New Nightmare (1994),6,1 May 2009,"Wes Craven's greatest creation, in a way, is A Nightmare on Elm Street. Not because it's his best film. But rather, because it's his most enduring film, and the series of sequels it spawned are a phenomenon unto itself. That hasn't changed today. And in the early 90's, when Freddy Krueger died in New Line's sixth film, it was an even bigger deal because it was still producing new and somewhat thought-provoking material. People were clearly getting tired of it, but it was still a creative and fairly innovative series. The formula had stretched near to its' breaking point, but the films continued delivering watchable and high concept fantasy sequences, mostly skilled and expensive special effects, spacey music, and inventive ""kills"" (as they're known online). It went through several permutations. And each new director brought their own unique take on it, visually. It wasn't what Craven had set out to make in his original, nor did it follow the rules he would have laid down had he stayed involved. But in its' own way, it was always fresh. And for people who got tired of the sleaze of Paramount's Friday the 13th, it was REfreshing as well.The problem with the later sequels was always story. The agonized process of writing and filming Part 4, 1988's The Dream Master, had the films' writing staff turn to the John Hughes school of weepy melodrama and the next two sequels would also feature those same unfortunate, put-upon teens. The angst always came first. Wes Craven decided a new sequel should switch the focus onto some adults for once. His finished product, this 1994 film, was not very successful at the box office. But got the critics raving. Some even gave this sequel more praise than the original. Is it worth it? I think- a little Yes, but a little No as well. Switching the focus to an adult main character is risky. Because teenagers are expected to daydream. As an adult myself, I can tell you that- you spend too much time daydreaming, and you're in deep trouble. Not because dreams take over. But because real life is something you don't turn your back on. Craven covers himself a little by making the main character an actress, living in a very nice, quite big house, doing well in her career. And she does struggle with real life problems as well as the nightmares the film needs her to have.The film is also an experiment with using actual real life people in the film business as actors in the story, playing themselves as they would behave were this film's situation happening in reality. That results in some awkward scenes, though it's in the interest of keeping the film feeling real. It's definitely one of the most realistic movies I've ever seen about an actor or actress's life, though I assume most of Heather Langenkamp's private details were kept out of the movie. She's not actually married to the gorgeous, sexy David Newsom. But she really was a mother and had a stalker. Not that any of that is truly important to the film itself, it's just part of what Craven wrote in, knowing that it was relevant to actresses in the movie business. Many TV and film actresses from the 80's and 90's were beginning to attract weird, obsessive fans. None moreso than women who had appeared in successful low budget horror films of the time- including Halloween's Nancy Kyes, Friday the 13th's Adrienne King, and Halloween 4 and 5's Danielle Harris.As a formula, this New Nightmare is nowhere near as visually interesting or cool as the previous films. It trades in that creepy, dark feel of intangibility, and trademark surreal Alice in Wonderland style (especially of Renny Harlin's sequel, The Dream Master), for a sense of complete reality. Where the nightmares look like everyday life. This of course, was better done in 1979's Phantasm, not to mention Dario Argento's extraordinary films. But, it was the 1990's. And things were starting to get gritty and hi-tech. So, New looks slick. But it's not as compelling or dreamlike. Or fun, as the previous films. However, it is an improvement on the formula in a few regards. The acting is much better. And though the film takes quite a while to get the viewer into the story, when it does, it becomes progressively more interesting. The film really begins to cook though once Miko Hughes' Dillon character winds up in a hospital, being tested by a presumptuous pediatrician with a distaste for Hollywood celebrities' choices when raising their kids. It's a devilishly perfect method of slipping in some social commentary on how authority figures impose their views of people who work in the horror genre onto others. As well as the character outright saying she thinks horror movies make children unstable.The film is a very good thriller, but isn't dangerous or dark enough to be a horror film. Another bone of contention is the film's wholly irritating sound design, from the bloated and bulky orchestra music score, to lame and clichéd booming bass crashes. This film already has an issue with choosing dozens of false scares over real ones, I wonder what they were thinking by making so many of the sounds so bass heavy. That doesn't make the film any more exciting. Nor does the film's big, stiff and unimpressive mythologically-set 'colosseum of dreams' finale. I do enjoy the film's references to Hansel & Gretel, and equating Freddy's power with that of a witch. The explanation for where he got that power has never been given but always fascinates me (Freddy's Dead tried and failed, miserably). I'm not sure exactly what sinks this as a horror film, but I truly recommend it as a good thriller which is meant to be pretty awkward. It's not prime Nightmare on Elm Street, but the series had to end somehow. This is as good a place as any.",New Nightmare
177,votesmall,Why does this have such a high rating???,6,22 November 2011,"Okay, first of all, let me say that I am not one of those people who doesn't ""get"" movies if they aren't ""edge of your seat"". For example, 2001: A Space Odyssey could have been good, but it just was too boring and had no explanation for the monolith and not enough focus on HAL 9000, the freaky antagonist supercomputer. Basically, most of the movie was shots of space with classical music. And everyone tells me that I didn't ""get"" it. No, I can't get it because there is no explanation, and it's too boring! BUT, I did love Hellraiser: Inferno, and In the Mouth of Madness. So, what's the problem with New Nightmare??? Okay, first of all is the fact of Freddy. I actually love his new look, the jacket and hand, although the sweater and hat looked kind of funny and I didn't understand why they put the greenish-red rings around his eyes. They went to so much work designing this new, evil looking Freddy and he can't have more than 20 minutes of screen time. Yep, just a little bit more than Freddy's Revenge. And yes, I know that Pinhead had just about as much screen time in Hellraiser: Inferno, but they didn't redesign Pinhead in that one. Okay, I do love psychological thrillers, but this was just BORING! It starts off with an all metal, robotic glove coming to life on the film set of a new Nightmare on Elm Street movie. The glove kills several special effects crew members and is about to kill Heather Langenkamp (Nancy)'s husband. And then she wakes up. Okay, that was awesome! Good, frightening, and all a dream. And the next forty five minutes or so have NOTHING going on for the movie! I will admit, the interview scene and the limousine scene were somewhat interesting, but the rest of it was just boring fluff. And also, we get a few decent shots of Robert Englund in this movie, but we don't see near enough! The entire movie revolves around two characters, that just can't carry the film. The kid is just annoying. He isn't creepy, he's just annoying. Some of the dream sequences are pretty freaky, but other than that, he's just a normal kid talking in a stupid voice. Also, the vomit scene was pretty much stolen from The Exorcist. So, by the end of the movie, all of the characters are referring to Heather as Nancy, but this is never explained. And then there is a showdown at the ""boiler room"", which looks more like an ancient Greek temple than a power plant mechanical room. Okay, this scene was too tacky. And Freddy actually extends his arm to get the kid, tries to ""eat him"", and wraps his tongue around Heather before burning to death and turning into, get this, the devil.???I will admit that I liked how it came to the real world, and we do get some pretty decent shots of Wes Craven and Robert Englund, and even a few other stars, but, like Freddy, they just don't have enough screen time. And some of the dream sequences are pretty creepy. But, I have two HUGE problems with this movie. First off, the fact that Heather has to wait until, like an hour and a half (around three days in the movie) after her kid tries to commit suicide, has seizures, nightmares, and tries to kill her before taking him to the hospital. Also, her kid is terrified of nightmares and she shuts the door so he is in the dark! ??? Worst mother ever! And it also isn't about Freddy on a film set, it's about him stalking Heather and her kid for two hours. This movie was so slow paced that it seemed like Titanic. Not to mention a hilariously low body count, with Freddy having a brand new glove, but breaking someone's neck! ??? Judge for yourself, but I thought it was boring. The kid was annoying, there wasn't enough Freddy, and Heather Langenkamp is just not an interesting character, unlike Nancy Thompson. Overall, this film is just TOO slow. I mean, Wes Craven had a really good idea here. Very original, just like the first Nightmare movie. But he didn't execute it very well. The kid was annoying, Heather Langenkamp looks bored and ""worried"" throughout the movie. And some of the dialogue is just ridiculous. Like how Wes all of a sudden knows what the new Freddy is is kind of ridiculous, because he couldn't possibly know that. Not to mention that in Never Sleep Again, he showed drawings for a ""Freddy mobile"" that he was going to put in the movie.",New Nightmare
178,Gorgorgorgoroth,So painful to watch,1,11 May 2016,"This movie was horrible. I cannot understand why so many people actually like this movie. It amazes me how this movie has a 77% on rottentomatoes. I watched this a couple days ago and I could not believe what I was watching.The whole idea of making a movie based on Heather Langenkamp's point of view as an actress, NOT as her character, was so fvcking stupid.The acting was HORRIBLE. When Heather went into a hospital to see her son and the black doctor saw her arm having very deep scratches, the black doctor was like ""what happened to your arm?"" as if it was nothing. There was almost no emotion at all. Dylan's babysitter and the other doctors were also sh1tty actresses. It was just painful to watch. Heather's acting wasn't much better.The fact that this movie was trying to be like the first Nightmare on Elm Street film by re-casting John Saxon and making Heather wear the same white PJs that she wore in the first Nightmare movie in this god-awful film was just dumb.Freddy's makeup looked like SH1T! Jesus Christ, I could not stand the sight of it. It looked horrible! It looked so rubbery and fake! Freddy's makeup in the older films was much better looking.The part where Heather was looking for her son in the hospital but she found out Dylan walked out of the hospital and was MILES away from the hospital ON FOOT was hilariously stupid. How did no one notice him walking outside from the hospital all by himself?! Freddy killed very few people in this film and the death scenes weren't even good. They were just boring to watch.This movie was so retarded that it hurts me to write this. I cannot believe the legendary Wes Craven actually made this pile of sh1t!",New Nightmare

Her husband, Chase believes its because of a mysterious caller harrassing his wife but its more then that, Freddy is out and he is taking over the ""real"" world killing the film makers of the freddy movies. He is using Dylan as his way into the real world and no one will believe Heather and when he finally does come out it turns the real world into the movie world all the actors and actresses begin thinking thier the character they used to play. Heather and Dylan have to fight Freddy in the end. Its a good movie worth the money and worth the time plus the freeway scene is great special effects.",New Nightmare
181,billy_loomis1,Better than the first one...,7,28 March 2001,"Firstly number one had a not very good direction, that's a fact. The script was mmm..., ok.Freddy himself was scary in the first 20 minutes, the whole thing started to collapse when freddy cut himself and said flashed his tongue! The sequel though has a very smart idea, freddy is not in your dreams, it is an obsession. An obsession that comes to the reality.So he attacks, most of the times in darkness, using his ''finger-knives'' only, so he becomes really scary!(I don't remember the whole picture so forgive me if i am wrong.) The sequel also involves the personality of Craven, which is nutty and dark, the personality of Robert ''freddy'' Englund, also... strange! And Nancy's because Heather Langengamp is acting like Nancy, she is not herself, at all! About Dylan, cute, that's all. Just cute. This film needed the sequels, they were like food to Craven, an insipiration(that's a fact, see that many times the sequels are refered...). I wrote that because someone said this should be number 2... The direction, this time isn't poor, the scipt is better written, not best though. This movie diserves a better score than 6.2/10, i believe that 7 is just right, not big or low. If anyone disagrees with this review i 'd be pleased if he could e-mail me. Also i 'd like to say that this is the first movie to be: movie-within-a-movie style. Well done wes! And it doesn't takes itself too serious like Numero Uno!(Number One)",New Nightmare
182,steelcorpfilms,"Craven saves the ""Nightmare"" series once again.",7,3 September 2001,"So what do you do when you've utterly ended a series and yet want to bring it back one more time and yet not have to deal with all the other sequels? Well, there are two ways to do this.  The first is called ""Halloween: H20"" (i.e. the WRONG way) and the second is called ""Wes Craven's New Nightmare"" (i.e. the RIGHT way).  Once again, like Dream Warriors, this flick brought back Heather Langenkamp and John Saxon (this time playing themselves) and Wes Craven as writer/director (and he played himself, too).This was actually the first out of the whole ""Nightmare"" series that I ever saw.  It was on TNT's Monster Vision back when good old Joe Bob Briggs hosted it.  I remember really enjoying it then and upon subsequent viewings, and also after watching the rest of the series, this is still one of my favorites.  The story went back to the more simple way that Craven had in the first film and it helps a lot.  Also, if you watch, there are tons of similarities and reoccurrences that happened in previous ""Nightmare"" films. To take a line from Joe Bob, ""It's sometimes hard to tell where reality ends and the movie begins.""  Or something to that extent.It was cool to see people playing themselves, like Wes Craven, Bob Shaye, and Robert Englund (Man, I want a pair of those purple tinted glasses he had.  Can you say, ""cool""?).  They all did pretty good considering they're not really actors (except Englund).  There was also Miko Hughes (you know, that creepy kid from ""Pete Semetary"") who did an excellent performance. He's probably one of the best child actors around (take that, Haley Joel Osment).Surprisingly enough, the special effects in this one were the only real let down for me.  They changed Freddy's make-up and glove and I didn't think they looked as good.  His face burns just seemed so dry, unlike the previous flicks where he was still gooey.  Also, the new glove doesn't hold up to the old one.  How could it?  The old glove is a classic, it was an actual glove. This new glove had the blades growing out of his fingertips, with bones on the outside and it looks very fake.  An old case of, `if it ain't broke, don't fix it.""  But since it's technically not the same Freddy, I guess they almost had to change it.  I just wish it had looked better.A good breakaway from the rest of the ""Nightmare"" series.  Good as a bookend of to the series and also as a stand-alone film.  Check it out.",New Nightmare
183,slasherstudios,Meta Movie Magic,10,29 August 2011,"After the dismal ""Freddy's Dead"", Freddy seemed to be dead and buried for at least a few years. It, however, was in 1994 that Wes Craven came up with the radical idea of bringing Freddy back for another nightmare a ""New Nightmare"". Gone was funny Freddy and the fresh looking 80′s MTV teenagers and in was a concept so unique and groundbreaking that it just couldn't work? Or could it But..let us start back at the beginning. In 1984, horror director Wes Craven created ""A Nightmare on Elm Street."" It was acclaimed as one of the scariest movies ever made and made unknowns like Robert Englund, Johnny Depp, and Heather Langenkamp huge stars. Ten years later, Heather is living happily with her husband, Chase, and her son, Dylan. But her life has now been turned upside down because she is being stalked by a person who sounds like Nightmare villain Freddy Krueger. Chase has just been killed in a car accident after he accidentally fell asleep behind the wheel. Dylan refuses to sleep any more, and New Line Cinema has just offered her a part in ""the ultimate Nightmare."" But some other strange things have been happening, including earthquakes and Craven being tight-lipped about the script. The ultimate truth is that Freddy Krueger is actually an ancient demon breaking out into our world, but in order to do that, he must go through Heather. And he knows he can get out by harming those near her.Sound convoluted? Pretentious? Overly meta? Shockingly, no. ""New Nightmare"" is that rare horror film in which everything works. The performances are pitch perfect, lead by a tour-de-force performance by the amazing Langenkamp. The script is full of twists and turns and the movie is quite possibly the best looking of the entire series. What starts out as a maze of mirrors becomes something much more than your typical nightmare. The film examines the role film plays on those who watch it. Something that Wes Craven's ""Scream"" would play out to great effect two years later. I really can't say enough about this film and homages to the original are expertly placed. It is one of my all time favorite horror films and a modern classic.",New Nightmare
184,joedamato-1,Not Craven's best work.,4,4 March 2005,"Perhaps Wes didn't find any other good way of closing Krueger theme than killing out of genre, in ""real life"" so that no one could even try to bring him back to life. Heather Langenkamp (herself) faces real problems when it turns out her son Dylan suffers with the same night terrors she had in ""nightmare on Elm Street"" movies. The point is Freddy came out of the movie to punish the shot crew for they didn't want to shoot another Elm Street movie. Perhaps the movie had more quality than Nightmares 2 and 6, but the story is wrong. It is nice to see your idol (Wes Craven) in a movie, but the explanation he gives Heather about how Freddy stuck in our world, is too childish. There are some good plot turns, but the plot in general is average. There are not many characters. That's already bad. Besides, the ending is weak when Dylan falls into Krueger's kingdom. I didn't like the designer work. 4 out of 10 (for Craven's appearance).",New Nightmare
185,moz-1,Craven ignores sequels and makes intersting movie.,8,13 March 2001,"This isn't really a sequel at all, its like The Player for horror movies. Once again Craven takes the horror genre and turns it entirely on its head as he did with the first Nightmare ten years before.  Here he sets up the Scream franchise and in doing so the entire teen-slasher renessaince of the late 20th century.  In short, Craven has made a lot of people a lot of money. More importantly thought, this is a compelling piece, that doen't match the first one, but is so far superior to the sequels that it practically ignores their existence.  Langenkamp bravely plays herself and the connection between her and her on-screen son is phenominal and believable. From a sort of Omen point of view, this film is quite chilling and from a strictly entertainment point of view, it is quite cool to see Freddy return to his dark roots.  In fact Freddy is pretty terrifying in this one, standing about a foot taller and built like an ox in a long, full length jacket. A great effort from the current master of horror, who has made one too many bad choices in his life.  Riveting and one of the few, truly scary movies of the 90's.",New Nightmare
186,RaoulGonzo,Wes Craven does it again!,8,25 February 2018,"Wes craven does post modernism before it was cool, this 2 years before he revitilised the horror genre again with ""Scream"".

It seems to be an interesting take on what the effects are on watching horror and even working in horror. Nearly everyone plays themselves, and there are a lot of tidbits and insider jokes for serious horror fans. You look at each set and there is immense detail to be found, the colour pattern of Wes Cravens office for example and what's on the shelves. The writing is extremely sharp, Wes craven has written and directed ""New Nightmare"", a film about him writing and directing ""New Nightmare"" and made it great. A highly original concept that he gets right.I watched this a few years ago and while enjoying it, i was baffled by what it all meant. After watching the whole franchise, and to be frank many more horrors, Wes Cravens New Nightmare was a joy on a number of levels.",New Nightmare
187,catalog,A Great Horror Film,8,3 December 1999,"While I'm tempted to call this the best of the Nightmare movies, technically it's not part of the series.  But without the Elm Street movies, this movie wouldn't exist.  So is it part of the series?  Who cares, my head hurts, and this is a great horror movie.The concept of this movie is fresh and original.  A demon that is usually trapped in the folk tales of humanity has been freed and is trying to break into our world.  The demon thinks he's Freddy, so he's terrorizing the principal players from the original movie.  Wes Craven mixes this story with real-world mythology and fairy tales to paint a convincing picture that draws the viewer into the film.  He also successfully ""reworks"" a lot of the scenes and ideas of the original Nightmare (melting stairs, tongue phone, Tina's death).  It's also interesting to see how the people involved in the first film have evolved over the years.  Heather Langenkamp has obviously grown as an actress, and Wes Craven has grown as a writer and a director.I guess you could call this the definitive Nightmare movie.  It contains a lot of in-jokes and references to the franchise, so fans and new viewers alike should like Wes Craven's New Nightmare.",New Nightmare
188,dan9241,Even better than the first one,8,20 April 2000,"This is by far the best Nightmare movie. The first one was very good, but I've seen many better horror films. The sequels were all interesting in the development and evolution of the story, but they weren't necessarily GOOD (though I did LOVE the third one). This movie, however, has some incredibly eerie moments and one of the best premises I've ever heard of. Having all of the actors play themselves makes the movie even scarier and more realistic. Wes Craven, I do believe, is a genius. From his earliest, low-budget work (check out the amazing ""Last House On The Left"" and the decent ""The Hills Have Eyes"") through his latest (this and the Scream trilogy), he has always had me on the edge of my seat.This was not only a good horror movie, but it was a good movie. It was just so interesting and held my interest from beginning to end (and it is slightly longer than most horror films). Still, make sure you've seen at least the first one before you see this to understand a lot of the twists, and the many in-jokes.",New Nightmare

Be warned, there's nothing new about it. Craven is back to flogging a dead horse, as he's done many times throughout his misguided career.The sad reality is that Craven is given far too much credit in a genre where he is, at best, an average talent. Compared to the brilliance of Robert Wise (The Haunting), Alfred Hitchcock (Psycho) and Tobe Hooper (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre), Mr Craven stands as a mere footnote in the annals of horror.Sorry if this sounds like a rant against Craven, but frankly I'm fed up with Freddy Krueger. After watching Scream a while back I did think Craven could not possibly get any more self-referential or tedious than he already is. Clearly I was wrong.",New Nightmare

However in my humble opinion the movie went back to the original an brought back the original Fred Krueger of the first movie.From the third movie out of the series, Fred Krueger became more and more an parody on himself and I really hated that. He wasn't scary at all anymore and sprung out at very VERY lame humor. But hey we probably shouldn't forget Wes Craven comes from a country were they also produce ""America's funniest home video's"" with the lamest humor there is to be found in the whole world. The sequels (from the third movie) are going the same way. The images are good, the story that is told is also good, but it all gets ruined by the very lame humor.Not in this movie anymore, Fred (not Freddy) is back and gave back the eery suspense that was also found in the first movie.(spoiler) On the other hand, the movie isn't very original. You get back the same effects and deaths as in the first movie and the storyline is about the same only at a different angle.

192,MovieCritic33-6,"The best ""Nightmare"" of them all, but you have to be more into suspense than horror...",10,22 April 2010,"Wes Craven's ""New Nightmare"" is the best out of all the ""Nightmare"" movies, although a part of me feels that it shouldn't be classified as being part of the ""Nightmare"" instalments, because the film has nothing to do with the premise of the other six instalments for the most part, and it's also much more of a suspense film than a horror movie.For this movie, Wes Craven decided to have his plot go in an entirely new direction.Wes Craven's ""New Nightmare"" revolves around the fictional life of Heather Langenkamp who portrayed ""Nancy"" in two of the ""Nightmare"" films. Heather Langenkamp has been having nightmares of her fictional character's nemesis ""Freddy Krueger"", and has also been receiving phone calls and mail from an unknown assailant. Later on in the plot it is discovered that Wes Craven has been working on a ""New Nightmare"" script that has already been put into production by the producers over at ""New Line"". But what was thought to have only been a script has now turned into something even darker. An evil spirit has taken the character of Freddy, and is trying to get into the real world. Although to successfully do this, the spirit or ""Freddy"" must defeat and overcome the one who first gave him all of his power ten years ago, Heather Langenkamp or ""Nancy"". But the big question is, is she willing to play ""Nancy"" one last time, and is she ready for what lies ahead? The premise of the story is well explained for the most part with only minor details that are left ambiguous to the viewers. However it's best not to over think the story too much, especially when it comes to movies of this genre, and simply go with it.Fans of Robert Englund might be disappointed that he has very little to do with the plot of this film, even though he plays himself and ""Freddy"" it is technically NOT him, but an evil entity of some sort who also only makes a full appearance towards the final half of the movie. Wes Craven made a clever decision to only have ""Freddy"" truly appear towards the end of the movie, because the whole time you're sitting there waiting for him to make an appearance, and because you know it's going to happen but not when it will happen creates a build up of suspense for the viewer. This also gives for a greater climax moment. That being said, Robert Englund delivers his best and scariest performance as ""the man with the claws"", and his appearance is sure to scare you in this one.As for Heather Langenkamp, she delivers a top-notch performance as both ""herself"" and ""Nancy"", and is also a thrill to watch in this film.Miko Hughes who plays Langenkamp's fictional son ""Dylan Porter"" does a great job at acting ""creepy"" and is very believable in his role.John Saxon who plays both himself and Nancy's father ""Lt. Donald Thompson"" also delivers a great performance.Overall for acting all of the characters, primary and secondary, held their own and gave solid performances.I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Wes Craven has to be one of the most creative and talented directors/screenwriters of the horror and thriller/suspense genre.Wes Craven's ""New Nightmare"" cleverly incorporates elements from the first film that were retained in everyone's memory, such as the ""tongue in the phone"" and Tina's death scene, to name a few of the more apparent ones. Fans of the original ""A Nightmare On Elm Street"" are in for some scares as well as some big time shivers as the clock counts down for ""Nancy"" and ""Freddy's"" face-off that is unravelling rapidly to one last climatic showdown.A buy for most, and simply a rent for the rest pending on their preference of film.***** Stars Out Of *****",New Nightmare

So that could only mean that the acting was good, most of the dialogue was great (keep in mind, I did say 'most'), and that some parts are actually scary. Unlike 'Urban Legend', this movie is worth watching.  I liked the idea of it taking place in real life, with the actors on the run, not the characters they play.The special effects were pretty good too.  The blood looked like blood, and corpses looked like corpses.  Unlike the earlier Freddie movies, except the original of course, this one is worth watching.  I've said it before, and I'll say it again:  Sequels suck!  This one however is an exception.  If you want, you can see the original, but do not see the sequels leading up to this one.  They all suck.  'New Nightmare' is by the the same guy that did 'Scream' and 'Scream 2'.  I think personally, 'New Nightmare' is better than both of them.

194,LaserPoint,Great idea but not without it's flaws,7,2 May 2010,"I thurley enjoyed New Nightmare, although I cant help but fell that Wes Craven (who directed the original NOES) let a fantastic opportunity slip from his grasp in terms of undoing some of the damage parts 3 to 6 inflicted by taking Freddy back to his original, more evil roots. Freddy cracking silly one-liners was what made the previous sequels so cheesy and campy, and although there aren't near as many to speak of here, the ending battle sequence between Nancy and Freddy was what almost killed the film for me given how serious the subject manner obviously was and how corny the scene was delivered. On a much higher note; it was extremely well written, the camera angles were great and the score, acting and story were/was also really well done/told. I also loved Freddy's new look as it made him appear more menacing, and Julie's death was properly the best since Tina's way back in the original. Would've loved to see Robert England some what confront Freddy but oh well.. In closing: a great edition to the series and properly the second best right after the original, but at the same time, potentially, Wes Craven's New Nightmare could've been so much more.",New Nightmare

197,RockySchlockyRobot,Freddy's big breakthrough.,8,11 December 2006,"An interesting, and sadly overlooked, entry in the franchise, this is of importance to genre fans who want to see the ideas in Scream before they became Scream. Craven uses this movie to explore the boundaries between reality and fiction and to subvert many of the horror clichés while at the same time using them to get classic scares. He also manages, impressively, to get Freddy back to being a genuinely scary figure. This is helped by Freddy receiving a makeover that makes him look even more evil than he ever did before (in fact, this and the ""devil"" Freddy look from FvJ are probably his scariest incarnations).Langenkamp does slightly better here, playing a version of herself, but I still wish she'd never burdened the entire series with her presence. She's a great gal and does well to revisit a character she could have ditched a long time ago but there are many better actresses out there. It has to be said that everyone (Langenkamp, Englund, Saxon and even Craven, although he's the least of them,) does well as they bravely portray versions of themselves. And Lin Shaye is back in a minor role, although she may be the only one returning from the first movie NOT to be playing themselves.This movie, more than any other in the entire series, has intelligence, a great storyline and moments that offer something to really disturb most viewers (parents may feel especially unnerved with some scenes). It also has a number of great callbacks to the first movie and some nice references to classic ""horror"" stories, Handsel And Gretel being the most noticeable. The second best entry in the series and well worth giving another chance to if you disliked it the first time because it was ""too different"".",New Nightmare

It also brings us back an old friend well know Nancy Thompson or in this case Heather Langenkamp portraying herself like the fighter of Freddy Krueger.In Recap this movie has everything high shocks of terror with this new Freddy, a little bit of Gore in some deaths and a little Miko Hughes like a schizophrenic child being tormented.

The New Nightmare, however, let Freddy be as frightening as he had ever been.  In fact, he was probably a darker figure than he had been even in the first installment.  The frightening villain coupled with a rather outstanding plot made this movie very watchable. Sadly, however, the script was weak in too many areas to mention and the directing made it feel more like a USA Special than a big time horror movie. Also, Wes seemed to be a sort of omniscent observer, especially towards the end of the movie, and that just didn't work.  It was too hokey to work into a movie that suposedly took place in the real world.  But if you loved the first Nightmare and rue the day the others were made, see watch this movie and enjoy.

200,Gotensive,The Only Good Sequel,7,27 October 2007,"After watching the Original Nightmare On Elm Street, I was very satisfied. Satisfied in seeing a movie that actually had some thought put into it, and the result was something unique. However, after the original NOES there was nothing but crappy generic sequels that followed. Sequels in which Freddy turned into a stand up comedian, rather than the frightening figure he was in the original. The Sequels also used the same plot over and over again, which of-course after awhile became ridiculously tedious. The biggest problem though, IMO, is the sequels weren't both Written/Directed by Wes Craven. Craven, IMO, is the only one capable of producing a good NOES movie - And he proved it again with New Nightmare. New Nightmare, IMO, is every bit as good as the Original.

For a long time, during my Halloween binge, I would only get through the first three films in the series before moving onto some other movies. I love the first film and Dream Warriors is plenty of fun. 4 and 5 have been somewhat impenetrable for me though for some reason. Mostly it gets down to me getting a bit tired of Freddy. On a whim though, I skipped over to New Nightmare after hearing plenty of people talk about how fun it is. It did not disappoint! It was a ton of fun the whole way through and made me want to finally sit down and go through the entire series. There were flashes of the meta style that would eventually go into the Scream series and I enjoyed the creative blurring of lines between the fictional reality of the film and the relationship to the movies. A deeper analysis of the movie would be interesting and could explore the commodification of a person through their fictionalized self in Hollywood and how it can tear their life apart.

203,groucho_de_sade,one of the worst horror movies I've seen,1,15 November 2004,"This is the least frightening in a series of films that, to put it kindly, wasn't world-class cinema to start with. Wes Craven, a hack scare-film director if there ever was one, returns to the sinister icon that made him famous, Freddy Krueger, in this weird in-joke featuring Heather Langenkamp, the heroine of the original NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, as herself. She's now a wife and mother, living somewhere in Hollywood and keeping house. She's approached to make another Freddy film, but can't shake the feeling that it's a bad idea. Long story short, Freddy has decided to cross over from movie reality to our reality, so he can unleash his evil on the world in a much more direct way. Of course, this means that a lot of people have to die, and somewhere along the way her son becomes possessed by the evil man's spirit (or some such nonsense). Craven has always had a hard time scaring me, and while I can acknowledge the power (if not the greatness) of a LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT, or the originality of SERPENT AND THE RAINBOW, I have to say that I think his is one of the most undistinguished careers in Hollywood. I so disliked this movie that I couldn't believe it had actually been released... to be fair, the concept isn't at all bad; the execution is my problem. IT SIMPLY ISN'T SCARY!!!!!!!! In any case, NEW NIGHTMARE is in the end nothing less than a rationalization for cashing in a little more on the Freddy franchise (remember all that crap when the film was released about Craven admonishing those who referred to it as a sequel to the other NIGHTMARE films? Talk about pretentious!) This is most definitely a sequel, and a bad one at that, and I'd gladly take any other NIGHTMARE film, including the spectacularly abysmal part 5, over this trash. That's it, I just wanted to voice my negative opinion of this claptrap and do my part to balance all the favorable criticism this film has garnered here at the IMDb. For a good horror movie, watch anything by Cronenberg or some of Carpenter's stuff (though he's been running into some major-league suckage on his past few films)... or for that matter, the original NIGHTMARE. .005/10",New Nightmare

One thing that I don't like about this movie, is that it turns the movies in to just that...movies. I know they're all just movies, but I feel it's kind of a ripoff for the fans of the others to those who have followed them since the beginning. Sure, they continue the story but I wish they could have done it without knocking the others in the series. But it is a different approach, a more realistic one at that (No more Super Freddy or Nintendo deaths).The cast is great, some familiar faces return. Thankfully one of those faces is Heather Langenkamp, how is this possible, well like already mentioned, the other entries in the series were just movies in this movie so it was her character that died, she's back playing herself. I'm making this much more confusing then it really is, I think you get what I'm saying though. Robert Englund returns, as himself and as a re-imagined Freddy (I prefer the movie inside the movie Freddy more though). We also get cameo's from the man himself Wes Craven, Tuesday Knight and John Saxon (awesome!). Also, there's the addition of Dylan Porter (Miko Hughes playing Heather's son, this kid use to be everywhere).Reality begins to blur as the movie goes on and Heather must save her son as both mother and character Nancy. These elements come off as really effective. It's also a nice nod to the original's fans as we see similar situations and scenes reintroduced.The death scenes are fairly tame, even for a Nightmare movie. Sure we get the girl dragged around the walls and ceiling in the hospital, similar to one of Freddy's most famous kills from the original, but it just isn't enough. There's also Heather's 'husbands' death which I found to be fairly weak, death by motorized glove.One thing that meshes well with the story is the fairy tale aspect, the Hansel & Gretel bit definitely works. It's also a nice bit of foreshadowing when Heather reads the story to Dylan, as there's a similar conclusions to both movie and book.The build up to Freddy is nice. He really doesn't make many appearances until about the last 45 minutes. When we do get him, he's definitely not the same Freddy, he seems more clean cut to be honest. Not the best take on Freddy but definitely not the worst.One of my favorite scenes happens near the end. The chase scene on the highway turned out great. Both Heather and Dylan dodging traffic, looked great and it made for a really intense scene, nicely done.The final showdown is pretty solid. Heather must take pills and journey under the covers to reach the dream world, nice bit of fantasy added there. Freddy chases around Heather and Dylan for awhile in a dungeon like setting until they lock him in an oven (remember that bit of foreshadowing).All in all, this is definitely a solid entry in the series, took Freddy from being a complete joke to a respectable character and horror icon once again. Really gotta appreciate what Wes Craven did for the fans, not only bringing back Freddy, but bringing him in a way that's never been done before.8.5/10",New Nightmare

206,bluegattaca,Bored to tears,4,8 November 2015,I haven't watch a Freddy Krueger film in a longer time (over 10 years) and decided to watch this one. Not only have I never seen it before but on multiple websites it states it is one of the best of the series. If this is the best I don't think I would be able to see the worst this movie was good premise awful. The first ten minutes of the movie were great with a great premise. The actors from the other movies are shown making the movies and it's a movie within a movie. It started off great and then it just gets really boring with the female lead and you barely get to see Freddy throughout the movie and there's not much character to him at all. I guess they wanted to try something different but it was just an awful film.,New Nightmare

Over the years, Freddy became a joker. But in New Nightmare, Freddy is a menacing horrible evil creature that you feel like a bug about to be squashed. I have one word for New Nightmare: Terrifying. Absolutely shocking. Best horror movie besides the Exorcist. I will rank this as one of the scariest, eeriest, and most chilling horror movies ever.",New Nightmare

Craven's script and Heather's acting are outstanding, they were really on top of their game. The whole run of the movie, I was thinking ""what is going on?? what's gonna happen next??""There is not that many scares in it, or the death scenes, but the suspense... And Heather's uncertainty of what's going on really got to me, I could FEEL her anxiousness. Seriously, Heather Langenkamp didn't have an easy job in this one, she is basically in every scene of the movie, and she NAILED all of it.Also should be noted, this doesn't feel like a sequel to previous installments in the franchise, but rather a whole new nightmare itself (like the title suggests). It can even be watched without the knowledge of previous films (except the first one).",New Nightmare

After the 3rd movie, you really see a lack of quality in the writing and the atmospheric visuals.This movie tries to make it seem like it's real and I found it to all be a complete joke. Like, I stopped at one point watching the movie thinking ""Am I watching a Freddy movie?""There were some parts that got me really mad because it felt like the writers thought they were doing something cool to end the series. I get it, the studio is probably pressuring them that if they don't make enough profit then they'll stop the series for some time but come on... Why give in to the suits an just make something good?And, all of the kills where one would assume that Freddy could easily kill someone, it's like it doesn't happen and I was just baffled when watching it because before, Freddy was pretty ruthless but this is all hugging and childish. All his slow walking and messing with his claws and just wasting time is completely boring and a total waste of time.I seriously don't think anyone who wants to like the series should watch this.",New Nightmare
210,partybabe1998,Play Nancy one last time....,10,3 August 2014,"The Summary for this review shown above was just one of many chilling lines in this film; for the most part, the cast did a wonderful job. Wes Craven's New Nightmare is a meta-film and the premise revolves around the idea that an ancient evil has been captured within The story of Freddy Krueger and now that the story has ""died"", the evil has been unleashed; the main characters in the film are Heather langenkamp and her son Dylan(the child is played by Miko Hughes.) Heather is getting harassing phone calls from a strange deep voiced man, her son is acting strange, and her friends are dying. I won't give away to much about the film, but I will tell you that it has an incredible sense of dread and a lot of tense moments, and also the characters are likable so you feel sorry for them. So I would highly recommend this film.",New Nightmare

I suppose I'm comparing this and other horror films to how I viewed them when I was a kid, but I guess I just wish they were actually scary once in a while.  If anyone has any recommendations, please e-mail me.Anyhow, this movie's not bad and compares pretty well compared to the other Nightmare films.  In fact, there are actually a few interesting shots in the first half of the film.  The problem is that the last 30-40 minutes are REALLY bad.  Once Heather/Nancy enters the ""Nigthmare World,"" things go downhill fast.  Freddy just sort of runs around taunting Heather and her child and the entire seen looks more like a comedy than horror.  My advice is to watch this all the way through and then leave right after Nancy gets back to her house from the hospital.",New Nightmare
212,rob1234-56-355912,"Despite disliking the 'Nightmare' franchise, this was thoroughly enjoying",8,30 June 2011,"I am a huge fan of Wes Craven, i think he is one of the best in the directing business, however, i was never a fan of the Nightmare franchise. However on a dull winter night i was flicking through the TV listings and stumbled across this on ITV 4. I turned it on just as the film was beginning, slightly expecting to turn over in the next 5 minutes. However i'm pleased to say this fresh take on Freddy Kruger kept my eyes glued to the screen for the full film, without discovering too many negatives on the film.Where to start? Its tough cos there were many highlights to this film, especially the acting within. The actors put on a stunning show during the film, with much praise going to Miko Hughes for his fantastic portrayal of Dylan Porter. Heather Langenkamp also performed well, which is to be expecting from the main protagonist in the series.As for the film itself, i appreciated the original plot, and the clever twist on the films, and happy to see the back of that awful 'humor'. In addition, the films ending i found entertaining, yet slightly disturbing in a good way. One downside to the film i think is that it takes far too long for some proper action, and teeters closely to becoming cliché at times.I think, while watching this, you have to let some of the far-fetched scenes slide to enjoy it more.In summary, if your a fan of horrors, not necessarily The Nightmare Series, give this a go, i doubt you will be disappointed",New Nightmare

When I first heard of the plot, I thought it would be HIGHLY stupid, but was pleasantly surprised by how well-written and acted it is. In the seventh and final nightmare film, Freddy is back, and more frightening than ever with scarier knifes for his fingers... This film is very good because fact clashes with fiction, and Robert Englund, Heather Lagencamp, and Wes Craven star as themselves as well. It's very well-written (Wes Craven did the screenplay,) and it isn't trying to be funny like Nightmares 2-6. After the HUGE letdown of ""Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare,"" New Nightmare proves to be scary and real; the deaths aren't gross like in the fifth film... The deaths are bloody and well-done like in the first film. I truly believe that this is so great because Heather and Wes are back. But watch out for that annoying kid of hers!

215,designprodigy,It's a Dream come True :D,10,8 August 2006,"In Basic Instinct, Sharon Stone's character Catherine Tremell describes how writing teaches you to lie, She says when you make stuff up it has to be believable, a psychological concept in literature referred to as suspension of disbelief according to Tremell. I think this film is an excellent example of this concept. Perfectly woven around Heather... who is by far the hero of the series, and I must say... would have been a great candidate to become the Segourny Weaver of this franchise... Becoming a balls out guardian of the gate of the dream world, repeatedly sending Krueger packing... she is, symbolically, this relentless force that evil has never been able to corrupt or defeat because She refuses to give in to it. The strength of her soul comes through her eyes in the camera. She may not be able to see it in the mirror, but She can't hide it from the camera. Although it is obviously far too late to change the chain of sequels, It was definitely the right choice to bring her back for one... The movies with her are by far the best in my opinion... With the slight exception of the 6th, because I was fond of the actress who played Tracy... and the strength She exhibited. I think New Line should bring some kind of script into development with Heather Langencamp and if possible, I would like to star opposite her, :D",New Nightmare

They are just over-hyped. It should also be said that I don't enjoy any of the movies Scream 1-44 or Friday the 13th. It's just American trash for stupid Americans. Wes Craven's ""New"" Nightmare is supposed to be a horror movie but it's not scary and the character Freddy has no motive to anything he is doing. Even evil has motives. The things he does and the faces he makes are just plain silly. I didn't know if I should laugh or cry most of the time. The result was a feeling of plain indifference.I guess these kind of movies are for people who like to laugh at the cheap CGI, on the level of Tales from the Crypt.

218,geroldf,a great film - the greatest horror film ever,10,29 January 2002,"Wes Craven transcends the horror genre in this film. It is horrible, it is frightening, but it works on many levels besides horror at the same time. The self-referential technique blurring the border between film, film-maker, and real-world works perfectly. It takes the monster freddy, who we thought lived only in the dreamworld of cinema, and pulls him off the screen, into your brain, and maybe even into your living room. The horror of this filmserves only to heighten the immediacy of the storyline, and that storyline is brilliant.This film provides an answer to a question that mankind has pondered forever: why does evil exist? Craven has a very operational approach to what often seems an impenetrable enigma. Evil exists whenever we, that is, us, all of us, lack the courage to prevent it. Wherever love is lacking. Heather relies on her love and her courage to defeat Freddy, just as all of us must.
This means that Freddy is not a creature, or a force, that lives out there somewhere, trying to get in to our world. Freddy lives in your dreams. He lives inside of every human being. When we give in to fear, or lock love out of our heart, then Freddy can enter.I give this movie a 10/10, whether seen as a genre film or a universal comment on human existence.",New Nightmare

221,channel_serf,A flawed classic.,8,24 September 2003,"I watch this movie whenever I have the chance to catch it on cable. And I've found that, the more I see it, the more I like it. What I find most interesting is that SCREAM was praised for twisting fantasy and reality. (Teens find themselves trapped in a real life horror movie, and try to use the cliches they've seen in those movies to survive.) But NEW NIGHTMARE did it first, and in a much more challenging way.While the other sequels relied too heavily on ""comedy"" (because a lot of things that were meant to be funny actually weren't), I was impressed by how much drama there is in NEW NIGHTMARE. And it is all pretty effective. The young actor who plays the son is particularly good.I'll admit that, when I first saw this movie, I thought the beginning was a little slow. I think that's because I'd been conditioned by the other sequels to expect quick (and often cheap) thrills. Now, I appreciate the way NEW NIGHTMARE builds up to those thrills in a way that makes viewers feel emotionally invested in the action on screen.As for the ending, I have always liked it. I saw it as an homage to the earlier films, like this ""Freddy"" was playing at being the Freddy from the first 6 movies, but still maintained a menacing quality. I keep hearing some viewers say they would have preferred a different ending. Since I can't begin to imagine what that might be, I'm content with the one we got.NEW NIGHTMARE is a horror movie that wants you to think. It asks you to look at something that had gotten old and stale and see it in a new, fresh way. And I think that it largely succeeds. I give it an A-.",New Nightmare

Also food for though as to the inspiration behind the Wishmaster.My only real gripe of the film was the kid. Did he give me the arsehole!

This is indeed what happened to the Nightmare on Elm Street series....Wes Craven delivers his most original and most artistic film in recent years...this is the text that should appear if this film was re-released to todays audiences.  This movie not only has a great storyline, great cast, great writer and director, but it also has what everyone doubted - truely scary and suspensfull scenes.  I love these movies but i have to agree Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare took the biscuit so to speak, made Freddy even more of a joke.  Who would have thought after that dredfull installment to the series that a film like this could be brought out starring this character who has been made a joke out of by past filmmakers. The plot is tight - when before has a filmmaker dared to bend the folk between fictional characters and the real life actors that played them. This movie does this brilliantly, the actors are top notch at playing themselves as well as there characters in the series.  Heather Langenkamp is especially brilliant in this installment, this woman is one of the best actors who were around in hollywood at the time, why she didnt get as much work ill never know, i mean she's talented, she's beautiful and she doesnt get any work while at around the same time Pamela Anderson Lee was making a movie called Barbwire (Beautiful but bad actress in my opinion).This movie is light on gore and blood which gives it a more suspensful and atmospheric theme - we enjoy this suspense and atmosphere more than we enjoy the blood and gore in this movie.  Freddy is also very scary again which i though before this movie was released would never happen.  I mean im only 16 now so you can probably work out how long ive been watching these movies, Friday the 13th, Halloween and Child's play movies.  Id rather sit and watch a Freddy, Jason, Michael or Chucky movie instead of some of todays stuff that gets released.  I praise Wes Craven for bringing us this movie, i just love it, my favourite in the Nightmare series so far.  If you want a truely scary film, great acting, great storyline and great filmmaking then this is a great movie to sit in and watch with your girlfriend.  The music is top notch as well, Wes Cravens score in this movie is one of the best he has done.

Scream is a self aware film about horror, and nightmare on elm street was self contained horror with fantasy elements like dream warriors and such... this movie has both elements. The self aware sort of wall breaking, where they acknowledge the films in the film and of course when Freddy attacks its back to fantasy elements in dream like worlds. I suppose I see it as a creative way point for Wes Craven... though I like the more dark comedic Freddy of the previous, this movie is a bit more intelligent than the other's exploring the origination's of the evil that manifests Freddy. Of course I miss my CRT TV as some of the effects are not very good in HD, lack of film grain makes it less immersive in my opinion.

As I watched it I found many things I liked but that's not to say the ball wasn't dropped every so often plus the ending was kind of weak. It is a good movie; I didn't even mind elements taken from 4-6 in this to help create the new rules. However these new rules do seem fairly loose and there are things in it I just can't explain. Some of those elements might be an allegory but still certain things don't make sense that probably should; especially if this is considered the real world.I think this is the weakest of the good Elm Street films, like 1984's A Nightmare on Elm Street and 1987's Dream Warriors. I also have reservations about Freddy's Revenge (1985) that has grown on me over the years.Considering the last few films I can't be too hard here as there is intelligence put into the script but the reasons for these happenings are close but not well explained or they are but I don't completely buy into it. I like this film well enough I want to love it but it just doesn't do what is necessary all the way though. Next time I watch the films It will be a Quadrilogy of A Nightmare on Elm Street 1984, Freddy's Revenge, Dream Warriors and Wes Craven's New Nightmare.I will use the ""A Beautiful Dream"" Fan theory that may require the viewer to have seen 1, 3 and NN before. If someone is new to the movies I do recommend the Trilogy(s) or Quadrilogy order if one is to watch more than 1. Trilogy orders A Nightmare on Elm Street, Freddy's Revenge and Dream Warriors: 1, 3 and New Nightmareor my Quadrilogy option.

The acting leaves something to be desired (even when Heather Langenkamp plays herself she isn't believable...but she is fun to watch) but the direction is great and the script rocks. Any fan of movies in general should see this picture, whether they've seen another one in the series or not. I have a problem, though, with some of the special effects. Watching it on the television, the scene where Heather chases her son across the freeway looks staged and fake...you can imagine Heather standing in front of a blue screen and pretending to dodge cars...the lighting is all wrong. And, some of the action scenes (like the first scene where the special effects hand attacks the techies)are rushed and hard to follow. Still, the cameos by Bob Shay and others are fun to watch.

Credit for some cool visuals, but those few moments aside, this movie was terribly boring. Having only seen New Nightmare once, it felt as though it were made for a younger audience (significantly younger than that of the rest of the franchise). I was very excited to see this movie due to its interesting premise and promise of creativity... Apparently the premise is more interesting than the movie itself. Having the movie centre around a little boy wasn't a bad idea (despite the cliché effect it has had on many other horror films), but was executed poorly. The violence was dissatisfying, and occurred rarely for a movie featuring Freddy Krueger. New Nightmare is not bad, but for the film that should have rebooted the Elm Street franchise, it includes little to nothing frightening, funny, or particularly interesting.

Heather Lagenkamp does an excellent job with her role, and she's comes across as a very loving, concerned, and sincere mother in this movie. John Saxon did a such a good job that sometimes it's creepy. Of course, Robert Englund does an awesome job of taking up the role of Freddy Krueger once again. He truly has showed me that no one else could play that part. The story behind this movie is that Heather Lagenkamp and her co-stars from the first Nightmare on Elm street film start being haunted in ""Real Life"" by the character from the film, Freddy Krueger.

232,Bronsonioni,"Wes Craven's ""New Horror Film""",8,5 April 2002,"""Wes Craven's New Nightmare,"" the seventh film in the ""Elm Street"" series, is one of the most unique, intelligent, and masterful horror films of all time.  Craven has allowed this film franchise to evolve (primarily into second rate thrills and a cult following), and now that he has taken control of this project, the pointless sequels now seem to have a point. The most engaging and intriguing part of the film is that it actually sets itself up as a film within a film.  The opening scene uses the same music as the original film, and starts in an underground layer reminiscent of Freddy's original boiler room.  This time however, it isn't a dream, but rather a movie set (and of course, movies are nothing more than a few peoples dreams). The premise of this film is that Heather Langenkamp (the star of the original film) and her son are being harassed by a demon who has taken the form of Freddy Krueger.  Most of the people around her think she is crazy, and this has been brought about by a prank caller.  However, as the film digresses, it is explained that the demon is an ancient evil that was bound in the horror film.  Now that Freddy was killed (in the series sixth installment), the demon is free to cross-over from the world of movies to our world. The premise is an amazing metaphor for filmmaking, and it makes for a poignant examination of the consequences a director must accept once he has released a film.  Note the scene in which Heather gives an interview, a very haunting image is placed in this scene showing the drastic and horrifying effect that movies can have on their audience. But, ultimately, ""Wes Craven's New Nightmare"" shows that films are worth all of the risks they take.  Especially when they are handled in as intelligent and careful a manner as this one.",New Nightmare

However, i watched it again last night and realised just how bad this movie is. The acting (especially from Lagenkamp) is terrible. Her reaction to her Husband dying is just not believable, she is devoid of emotion.Now on to the subject of Freddy, they've tried to make Freddy darker and scarier like the original freddy was, but, it seems as if Robert Englund has forgotten how to portray him as such, and he is now a hybrid of old freddy and later ""jokey"" freddy. The ending is also terrible. The special effects are some of the worst seen, and Englund turns into a panto dame with lines such as ""I've got some gingerbread for you!"" and an incredible extending tongue. My advice is if you saw this ages ago and thought it was a clever satirical way of bringing Freddy back, then go back to it and just see how cheap and terrible it looks and is. What a waste of £4.99!!!",New Nightmare
234,pumpkinhead_lance112,One of the finest thrillers of all time...,10,19 December 2002,"New Nightmare, is Craven's Masterpiece. It is not just a movie, but an experience. It is not a sequel to any of the previous films, and takes place outside of the series into the 'real' world. The character 'Freddy' was killed off once and for all in 'Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare' (aka Nightmare on Elm Street 7). 'New Nightmare' doesn't follow the rules of the original movies because they were fiction, not real. What you are watching when viewing 'New Nightmare' is REAL. Somehow this imaginary character has life, and is killing the cast and crew who made the 'Nightmare' films. The film is made on such a beautiful and professional level, it's quite amazing. Don't get me wrong, it is overall, a horror film, but it's much much more.The 'Nightmare' series are good cheap fun. But 'New Nightmare' is not to be taken lightly. It's dead serious. No pun intended. The score is mostly full orchestra with some choir injected in. Something never done in a movie with, 'Freddy' as the star. Many actors, actresses, and producers play themselves. Even a portion of the film takes place at New Line Studios! I highly recommend this film to horror and non-horror movie buffs alike.It's not to be missed. **** out of **** stars!",New Nightmare
235,zayats100,How to make sequels and find a way out of dead ends,8,28 August 2018,"Well, the 7th movie in a franchise...what to expect apart from a predictable plot with farfetched twists, actors who grab any work they could get and operators with trembling hands? Especially, if a franchise has been completely dead after the 4th part and all we saw afterwards was just a violation of the dead body of this series.Even the most terrible acting performance and the most incoherent screenplay I've ever seen, that were distinctive marks of the 6th movie, couldn't prevent the creation of another sequel. The 7th film finally finished the Elm Street series and God, how terrible must this one be? - I thought in despair.And it came as a complete surprise - not only New Nightmare proved to be watchable, but it was good. Really good. Wes Craven took the dead body of his offspring from the hands of evil producers and reanimated it for the very last time. Actually, it's hardly another movie of the series, rather it's a film based (and quite freely) on characters of the original Nightmare, thus good old Wes let himself some space to spread his ideas and not just repeat that narrow line of the story about children afraid of falling asleep who finally find enough courage to fight Freddy back in their dreams. Less blood, less violence, less Freddy. And still - it's a horror film, not just a wanna-be-horror-but-more-of-a-comedy thing. Real acting is present as well as a clever plot and a nice touch of a couple of homages to the first Nightmare.Although New Nightmare might be a disappointment for those who are still in love with Mr. Krueger and his grotesque cruelty, I would definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the original story and then gradually developed hatred or boredom over the affection as the sequels were coming out.

236,magoo85,A Brilliant Movie that restores Freddy to what he should be *Safety Spoilers*,10,8 July 2004,"The definition of a spoiler can be pretty liberal, so I wrote safety spoilers.OK. Where to start. Well as a die-hard Freddy fan, it pained me to see the series deteriorate in parts 5 and 6. Freddy is a child murderer, not a standup comic. It was just terrible to watch how bad it became. Enter New Nightmare.New Nightmare proves that Nightmare on Elm Street movies can not and must not be made without Wes Craven. The man is truly a horror genius ahead of his time. *Spoiler* The idea that Freddy is not just a movie icon, but a demon bent on entering our world is a brilliant but risky idea. Craven nevertheless delivers the best movie in the series and an amazing way to tie it all together.One of the biggest criticisms is the intellectual aspect of New Nightmare. It is not your typical horror/thriller. If you want gore, go to the Friday the 13th movies. A movie like New Nightmare is truly for those with a brain. While it is by far not the most intellectual movie ever, it is easily the most psychological of the Nightmare movies, which makes it the best. *Spoiler* I enjoyed the Heather/Wes scene where Wes talks about the damage that can be done by changing the story, censoring it, watering it down, or outright banning it, etc.Unlike most of its predecessors, New Nightmare relies on a strong script and acting. As I mentioned before, Craven's script is absolutely beautifully written. Heather Langenkamp was great as herself and Nancy. Seeing her as Nancy was nostalgia-rific for a Nightmare addict like me. She is a beautiful talented woman who really should have been in a lot more films than she was. What can be said about Robert Englund? As himself, he had that air of uncertainty around him because you knew he was Freddy. As much as Wes' writing helped make Freddy evil again, so did Englund bringing him to life on the screen. This was the least amount of screen time Freddy had, but it worked amazingly.Miko Hughes was adequate as Dylan, excelling at times on screen. I was very pleasantly surprised at Tracy Middendorf as Julie, as she was quite good. I was very sad to see her die, though it was awesome how Julie (Freddy's last kill) and *spoiler* Tina (Fredddy's first kill) were killed in the same fashion. John Saxon was good to see back on the screen, but nothing spectacular. He is like a steady pulse in all the Nightmare movies, comforting to see on screen yet nothing spectacular. *spoiler* The Nancy/Donald Thompson scene, which marked Heather's ""acceptance"" of Nancy for that one last time, was really cool. The real life people (Wes Craven, Bob Shaye, etc.)were obviously not Oscar nominees, but did very respectably on screen.In short, New Nightmare saved the Nightmare on Elm Street Franchise. It restored Freddy to what he should be, an sick, demented evil essence, not some stand-up comedian. Its psychology will be lost on the lower level gore-freaks, but will surely be appreciated by the large core audience. The best Nightmare film and one of the best horror films of all time. *spoiler* To paraphrase the meaning of what Wes Craven said, Freddy really is back where he belongs. Evil.",New Nightmare
237,sycobob23,Wes Craven should be ashamed!!!,1,16 September 2005,"This film is original and the ideas behind it are great. A film in a film. But don't be fooled this is all it has going for it. Wes Craven should be ashamed of this utter garbage! Wes had the gall to bad mouth all the other Nightmare sequels. I'll admit some of them were quite bad but at least they were watchable. Forget using sleeping pills, try watching this film and you'll be asleep half way through it. Thats if your lucky.First off, the Freddy from the original series is not in this one. It is a demon that mimics horror icons. So be forewarned this is not a sequel. More of an attempt at an original film. The story pretty much involves this demon who takes the form of horror villains. When Freddy was supposedly dispatched in Freddys Dead, the demon is set free to haunt the actors that starred in the original Nightmare. Wes attempts to make Freddy once again scary and not the wise cracker that he turned out to be. There are a few scenes that do make him seem scary but by the end of the film Freddy looks more like the one portrayed in Freddys Dead.The reason this film is so horrible is due to the snail like pace. I grew up loving the slower paced horror films that built tension. This film built none. We are shown scenes of Nancy going to interviews and talk shows. You would think Heather Langenkamp was a major player in Hollywood. The only other film I've seen her in since the Nightmare series was the made for T.V. movie of the Tonya Harding scandal. So its almost laughable. Not to mention that she is portrayed as unlikable bitch. It seems that Wes thought people loved the character of Nancy so there was no need to make us care for Heather. In one scene she closes a window on a fan who tries to talk to her. In another scene we see how Robert spends time signing autographs while Heather seems impatient with him. By this time I really could care less if she was slowly tortured and I loved Nancy. I was actually bothered by her demise in Nightmare 3.The new Freddys wardrobe is beyond horrible. Freddy now has tight leather pants, that look like something you would wear to a disco. His new bone type glove is good for another laugh. Maybe if this film wasn't so boring I would of gave it more then 1 star but this film is almost unwatchable. I remember seeing this at the theater and watched 4 people walk out. Trust me after seeing this film once you'll never want to see it again. So be forewarned.",New Nightmare
238,waskzantz,Art-imitates-Life in the final showdown between Freddy Krueger and his creators.,8,1 June 2005,"When Freddy Krueger was done with and on the shelf of New Line Cinema, after ""The Final Nightmare"", Wes Craven came back to grab his concept and deliver a proper ending to the saga. He already had tried to grab the lead of the saga in Nightmare 3, but was put aside for his ambition. But this time he knew he had to write material that would not only bring people back into the basic story, but also, create a new atmosphere that wouldn't break the notion that Freddy Krueger really died in ""The Final Nightmare"".Therefore, he doesn't start where the previous sequel ended - has happened with the other installments. He transposes the barrier, to create a new environment, like only a storyteller could. This story begins in a supposed real life. Heather Langenkamp plays her own real life character, in a curious art-imitates-life new background.I don't want to reveal too much of the plot, but Both Heather Langenkamp, his husband and son are having recurring nightmares dealing with the making of the ""Nightmare"" movies. Though they don't really have Freddy Krueger in it, they surely bring up the idea that he is behind all of it. But being Freddy a character, why is Heather having nightmares? Who is in her dreams and why? The mystery doesn't bother Heather too much until her husband suffers a little accident...The previous sequels spent too much time with non-important character's deaths, but this one delivers depth to the characters so that you really fear for them when the tension comes to play. For instance, the original movie was about Nancy, the misunderstood teenager fighting alone for survival, but now, Heather Langenkamp is haunted by the legacy of her acting and has to fight alone not only for her life, but for the life of her son who is the chosen victim of the nightmare monster.There's only a flaw in the movie, and it is a pretty basic one and it has to do with logic: *SPOILER HERE* If the ancient monster haunting Wes Craven's dreams wants to come to life why choose - as a doorway - an actress who only was in two movies? Yes, we all know Nancy was the first character to kill Freddy Krueger in a movie, but so what? Is she more important than Lisa Wilcox (Alice), who killed him twice in the saga, or Liza Zane (Maggie) who killed him definitely in the last one? I guess that the storyline would be better understood and more challenging if the story was about Robert Englund fighting for the life of his son and haunted by the ghost of his cinema character. Wouldn't it be more comprehensible if the ancient monster wanted to come to life through the person who gave him life for so many years? Well, I guess Wes Craven has a thing for damsels in distress, so he had to go for the female star even if she isn't that relevant on the franchise of Nightmare on Elm Street. As the movie goes forward and the monster starts growing with powers, Heather's life starts blending with the one of her character, Nancy, one of the things that puts us back in the dreamy world that was created for ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" Though it's considered as a sequel, I can't see this movie as one, but as a reinvention of Freddy Krueger, who regains his scary side, erasing in a blink of an eye all the sequels that followed the 1984 debut.Watch out for great action sequences, like the highway crash and the final confrontation between Heather-turned-Nancy and her nemesis Freddy Krueger. Prepare yourself, the last 20 minutes are a roller-coaster.This is the ultimate ""Nightmare"" movie, a chance for people to get back to the original monster created in 1984 and that has been destroyed ever since and turned into a comic relief. And in fact, the concept of the movie was so interesting that Wes Craven tried to go there again in Scream 3, where the art-imitates-life idea comes again to life. But it certainly doesn't have the mind-blowing effect as this particular one did.",New Nightmare
239,Marc-59,Freddy at his most evil,8,1 December 1998,"Although I enjoyed the entire series, I thought this was the best sequel. Bringing Freddy into ""the real world"" has created a whole new monster where he is more evil and less comedic. Robert Englund is creepy even when he plays himself. The acting is a bit sub-par but the storyline more than makes up for it. It's also great seeing Heather Langenkamp again.

241,typedeaf,I'm a Freddy and Nancy fan so...need I say more?,10,28 June 2001,"My opinion on this movie is probably very biased because I grew up watching Freddy movies and adoring Nancy, consequently the actress herself, for her character.

Basically Wes Craven, the creator of nightmare on elm street is having nightmares, and thinks he could use them in a new nightmare movie, meanwhile, Nancy, (heather langenkamp) from the first and 3rd movies, is also having the nightmares. soon, its revealed that Freddy, angry at being killed in the last nightmare, is real, and is hunting down the crew that killed him off, and the cast from the previous movies...",New Nightmare

I just want to say how nice it was to see Wes Craven return and pull these series out of the crap.....Decent movie all in all, compared to the 6th. one(which I think was as important to these series as Season of the Witch was for the Halloween series) Craven also seemed to give a certain element of fear back to Freddy which was lost after the 3rd. movie..... I think it's mostly because he has dropped all those lame one-liners that seemed to make Freddy more silly than scary, and therefore, making this movie like a C-Class family-horror-comedy-thriller-something. Oh well, I don't know.....I recommend it though if you are in the mood for a well written and an original thriller.",New Nightmare

249,bilbob20,Heather Langenkamp returns one last time to defeat the terrifying Freddy Kruegar,9,2 November 2006,"Wes Craven returns to the series that he created in 1984 with his exquisite take on nightmares and how they can cross into reality to affect the sufferer. Here he brings back his original cast of Heather Langenkamp, John Saxon and Robert Englund as they all play themselves fighting against an evil entity that has been ensnared as Freddy for the past ten years since the creation of the Elm Street phenomenon. Now that the character and films have ended, he is trying to cross over into reality to affect the reality of the movie stars. Wes Craven explains to Heather, only making another film and defeating the character can ensnare him back in his rightful place and save humanity from the horrors that he threatens. Heather Langenkamp is perfect in the part she was born to play and as the film draws to its terrifying conclusion, each of the stars find themselves unwittingly playing their alter-ego's from the movie. Its a clever film that turns the Elm Street series on its head, and crafts a beautiful yet terrifying story of survival against unspeakable horrors.",New Nightmare

I've always been a hardcore fan of the series, but all other movies in this series pale in comparison to the final film. Everyone latched onto the 'Scream' series because of the unique idea of talking about horror movies in the movie (to make it seem more real), but that idea was born with this film, not Scream.Add to that, the orchestral soundtrack and the newer, scarier, Freddy and this is a permanent featured film in my personal library.

I loved Freddy's Dead. I loved funny Freddy. Robert Englund didn't play Freddy in this one fyi. New Nightmare is long and boring. The people who gave this positive reviews are the same ones who watched Breaking Bad and spent the time gushing over Anna Gunn's performance. Walt's wife was an obnoxious nag. Ooooo, ooooo, why is Marie always wearing purple? What does it symbolize? Walter White is evil...... They never explained what happen to that Spanish kid.... Where was Jesse going? These people should be tied to a chair and forced to watch and find the symbolism in Micheal Bay's movies. What am I talking about? I'm not making any sense? This isn't a review, its just a rant?
