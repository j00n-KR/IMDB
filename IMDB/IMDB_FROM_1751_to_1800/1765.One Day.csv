0,TheLittleSongbird,A pleasant movie if not quite working as well as it had potential to,7,31 August 2011,"The book was a wonderful read. One Day was a movie I was looking forward to, and while it was disappointing I found it very pleasant.What made the book so good and such a joy to read was not just the emotional impact, modern angst and characterisation but also how nostalgic it made me. The emotional impact and angst is here in the movie, what wasn't quite there was the nostalgia-evidence of it but could've been more- and characterisation which does feel choppy especially with Patricia Clarkson's Alison though Dexter is well realised.That said, I loved the beautiful look of the film, the soundtrack which gave the film its sense of nostalgia and the witty banter between Sturgess and Hathaway. The romantic elements are touching though the comedic elements don't always work coming across as a tad contrived. The direction is decent, the telling of the story is well paced(if somewhat glacial) and faithful and the script has some nice touches but also some weak ones. Of the support performances I thought Rafe Spall, Romola Garai and Ken Stott were the most effective and Clarkson was good if deserving of more to do. The picture belongs to Jim Sturgess, while staying true to his bad boy character of Dexter he also manages to be sympathetic.My feelings on Anne Hathaway were mixed. I loved her radiance and her chemistry with Sturgess, but her accent was inconsistent and felt forced and unnatural whenever she tried it. The shock ending also felt more bewildering than anything else, not the actual tragedy itself but rather the flashbacks that succeeded that I wasn't sure was really needed.In conclusion, pleasant if not entirely successful. 6.5/10 Bethany Cox",One Day
1,SnoopyStyle,good love story disjointed by gimmick,6,23 November 2013,"Emma (Anne Hathaway) and Dexter (Jim Sturgess) are a couple who first meet on their university graduation. They would grow apart and travel different paths. Dexter would become a successful TV host. Emma would date Ian (Rafe Spall). They're like migrating birds where their lives keep returning to each other.The movie starts on July 15th, 1988 and it returns to that date every subsequent year. It's a gimmick that I've never seen before. I think there's a good reason for that. The story flow is disrupted and disjointed. It's a device that makes the movie feel silly and false. How many interesting things happens on the same date? It feels manufactured. Also important moments are missed. It just becomes an exercise in trying to keep up with the story.I like Anne Hathaway and Jim Sturgess as a couple. They have a sweet chemistry. And they have a sense of depth in their relationship. The only adjustment is Anne's accent. It's always weird to see Americans taking out their British accent. I think this could be a great love story but it's too disjointed to built momentum.",One Day
2,kosmasp,One movie,8,2 February 2012,"I haven't read the novel, so I cannot say how close it is to the source material. Therefor I went to watch the movie completely uninhibited and free of any feelings. But watching Anne Hatheway is never a displeasure for me. Jim Sturgess is a fine actor too of course. But the former ""Princess"" (Anne H.) is stealing the show here. Her subtle performance is phenomenal once again.But it is not only the actors that are great here. The story helps too. And while you get what the movie is doing (it's in the title you see), there are still some surprises left along the way (especially if you haven't read the book I reckon). One of the better romantic movies out there and for that fact alone worth your time and worth to watch/own.",One Day
3,jboothmillard,One Day,5,15 March 2014,"From director Lone Scherfig (An Education), I saw the DVD for this film a few times, I might have heard as well that it was a sad film, but to be honest, I'm most often in the mood to watch a weepy. Basically after graduating from the University of Edinburgh, on 15th July 1988, Emma Morley (Anne Hathaway) and Dexter Mayhew (Jim Sturgess) first meet, and after spending the night in each other's company agree to be friends, the story sees them reconnect every year on the same one day, 15th July, over twenty three years. 1989, Emma is a waitress in a Mexican restaurant in London and Dexter is travelling the world drinking and hanging with various women, later he becomes rich and is successful as a raucous late-night television show presenter, and although meeting him starts dating unfunny comedian Ian (Rafe Spall, Timothy's son) and she becomes a school teacher. Dexter's mother Alison (Patricia Clarkson) is diagnosed with terminal cancer, and is not impressed with his TV show, on a visit to see her he is intoxicated, and his disappointed father Steven (Ken Stott) warns him he will be banned from visiting if he returns intoxicated again, meanwhile Ian continues to irritate Emma and organises a meeting with Dexter. High on cocaine Dexter insults Emma and ignoring her most of the time while flirting with other women, she storms off after a public scene and outside says that they must end their friendship for good having outgrown each other, she also confesses to loving him before running off crying. Some years later Emma and Dexter are invited to the wedding of Emma's former university roommate and Dexter's old friend, she finds out he is engaged to Sylvie (Romola Garai) and to become a father, she is upset and tries to hide it, but they share a momentary kiss, and coincidentally Dexter's fiancée, who he does marry, is having an affair with his old friend, so he gets a divorce from Sylvie. Emma finally dumps Ian, becomes a published author and moves to Paris, where on 15th July 2003 Dexter visits her hoping to rekindle, he has only had a one night stand following his marriage break up, but Emma is already seeing jazz band piano player boyfriend Jean- Pierre (Sébastien Dupuis), knowing this Dexter plans to leave, but she has second thoughts and chases after him, telling him he must never hurt, lie or cheat on her, they share a passionate kiss and finally begin a full relationship; the next few years see them get engaged and marry, Dexter runs his own lucrative café in England, and as a couple they are trying for a baby without any success. But tragedy strikes when while riding her bicycle through a blind spot on 15th July 2006 Emma is hit by a truck and dies, Dexter is in despair and turns self-destructive, especially on 15th July, but Sylvie supports him over the years, even from Ian, and he gets to see their daughter Jasmine (Emilia Jones), and in the end Dexter takes his daughter to the spot he met Emma. Also starring Broadchurch's Jodie Whittaker as Tilly, Georgia King as Suki Meadows, Amanda Fairbank-Hynes as Tara and Matthew Beard as Murray Cope. Hathaway is sweet and feisty, Sturgess is complicated but charming, and together they do make a nice couple with their witty banter and close friendship that of course eventually turns into passion, the story concept perhaps needed a little tweaking as I drifted off when the time changed, but the concept and laughs are certainly near enough good, the slow love story and only occasional reunions is nothing new, but this is a good natured and only towards the end sad romantic comedy drama. Worth watching!",One Day
4,sunwarrior13,July 15th,9,22 September 2012,"One Day is a dramatic feature that stars Anne Hathaway and Jim Sturgess together with Patricia Clarkson,Romola Garai,Rafe Spall and Ken Stott. It was adapted by David Nicholls from his novel of the same title and directed by Lone Scherfig.After one day together - July 15, 1988 - during their college graduation,Emma Morley and Dexter Mayhew begin a friendship that will last a lifetime. She is a working-class girl of principle and ambition who dreams of making the world a better place. He is a wealthy charmer who dreams that the world will be his playground. For the next two decades, key moments of their relationship are experienced over several July 15ths in their lives. Together and apart, we see Dex and Em through their friendship and fights, hopes and missed opportunities, laughter and tears. Somewhere along their journey, these two people realize that what they are searching and hoping for has been there for them all along. The movie is just another way or method of telling an old-fashioned love story. Despite the fact that it doesn't quite deliver, it remains a witty, touching and largely enjoyable romantic story about two people - Emma and Dexter - that come to terms with the nature of love and life itself.",One Day
5,ferguson-6,"Not Again Next Year, Please",4,21 August 2011,"Greetings again from the darkness. I have not read David Nicholls' novel, but my understanding is that it is extremely well written and its loyal readers really connected with Emma and Dexter. If that's true, then this film version is even worse than I thought while watching.This literally is my least favorite type of movie. A movie that assumes its viewers are unable to think for themselves or judge the actions of its characters. In other words, the filmmakers take for granted that we will accept whatever is shown on the big screen.First let me say that I completely understand the school girl crush that a young Emma (Anne Hathaway) has on her classmate Dexter (Jim Sturgess). He is handsome and charismatic and comes from more money than she. I also understand Dexter's attraction to the lovely Emma. She is very pretty - despite the ridiculous over-sized glasses for the early scenes - and very intelligent, and a significantly nicer person than he.What makes absolutely no sense to me is her continued attraction to this drunken, empty soul for the next twenty years. She is too smart to pine away the years hoping he will wise up and coming running to her. We are supposed to believe that she has no interest in any other relationship other than the non-threatening one with flopping stand-up comedian Ian (played by Timothy Spall's son Rafe) and a ""boring"" French Jazz Pianist.Dexter's mother is played by Patricia Clarkson. As she is dying from cancer, she tells him that she believes he will grow into a good man, but isn't there yet. I guess we are supposed to take her word for it. Instead we only see Dexter go from a selfish pig as a TV personality to a defeated man who must perform manual labor for the first time in his life. My issue is that a defeated man is not necessarily a good man. A man resigned to his life has not necessarily reached enlightenment. Where is Emma's proof that he deserves her? Where is the indication that her life with him will be better? I tell you where ... in the mind of that school girl from years ago.Please don't mistake my words as that of one who has no faith in romantic stories. There are so many ways this story could have turned that it would have had me. Instead it chose a path that assumed I was ignorant ... totally accepting of ridiculous story being laid out for me.My final comments on the film involve the cast. Anne Hathaway is an incredibly talented performer. She is not, however, British. Her accent is terribly distracting. Jim Sturgess is a handsome guy, but just not charismatic enough to pull off the TV personality role. Patricia Clarkson is a fantastic actress, but she is not British either. Seriously, are there not enough British actresses? The casting smells like a money-grubbing production team. As for director Lone Scherfig ... her previous film An Education was cinematic excellence. This is an unacceptable follow-up and we expect better next time.I will say the locations of Edinburg, London and Paris were beautiful and different than we usually get from the movies. That provided the only real enjoyment from this highly disappointing movie.",One Day
6,phd_travel,Not a good story! Waste of time.,1,27 March 2012,"Don't bother with this movie unless you want to feel down after watching it. The outcome is just so unnecessary.Depressing is the word that comes to mind after watching this movie. If she was going to die then what was the point? Felt like a total waste of time. The only interesting thing about this movie is the way it's told - looking at the same day every year for a stretch of many years.I am a fan of Anne Hathaway but her accent here was a bit inconsistent and maybe she shouldn't have tried at all. Apart from her accent, her acting is alright and she doesn't mind looking unattractive when required. Jim Sturgess looks different at different times and shows a bit more range than previous roles have allowed. But in the end their chemistry and romance weren't really allowed to flourish in the scenes shown. Some crucial moments could have been shown to make it more passionate.Didn't like this one at all. Don't bother.",One Day
7,gradyharp,'We'll be Friends': Nostalgia on St. Swithun's Day,8,13 December 2011,"ONE DAY is a gentle surprise of a film. Though the premise of a 20 year friendship turning into love is not a new one, the finesse the two main actors bring to this story makes it work like a fresh peach. Based on a novel by David Nicholls (who also write the screenplay) and directed with a fine sense of momentum by Lone Schering, this is a little romance with several rhapsodic and clever twists that tosses in a bit of historical interest just to keep things rolling.In a British weather lore proverb it is stated that if it rains on St. Swithin's day July 15th there will be rain for 40 days. In ONE DAY (we visit St. Swithin's day for 20 years) Dexter (Jim Sturgess) and Emma (Anne Hathaway) formally meet on July 15, 1986 as they graduate from college: each has big dreams for the future, and quite by accident they spend the night together - in a rather platonic way. They part ways as friends and as the years go by they both find themselves in jobs not quite up to their dreams: Emma waitresses at a TexMex grill while Dexter ends up in a tacky position as a front man for a low class television show. Dexter is a ladies man and has multiple partners while Emma is more reserved and only attaches to one - Ian (Rafe Spall) - who is a boring standup comedian, but is available. Dexter's girls tend toward the glamorous, including Suki (Georgia King) and Sylvie (Romola Garai) with whom he has a child, only to discover that Sylvie's taste in romance matches Dexter's Lothario role. Every year on July 15th Emma and Dexter meet, finally realizing that they are in love. Circumstances intervene to this perfect love story and the ending is unexpectedly touching.There are some fine cameo roles in the film, especially Patricia Clarkson and Ken Stott as Dexter's parents. One fascinating aspect of the film is watching the styles in hair and clothes change over the 20 years as well as the introduction of all the accoutrements of today. Times have changed as much as Emma and Dexter have changed, and that makes the film work even better. Hathaway and Sturgess are superb, creating tow credible characters about whom we can care.

8,namashi_1,Soulless....,4,8 October 2017,"For any Romantic film the aim is to be heartfelt & emotionally charged, but 'One Day' has neither. This film, in fact, is a soulless experience. Good Acting is the only redeeming factor.'One Day' Synopsis: After spending the night together on the night of their college graduation Dexter and Em are shown each year on the same date to see where they are in their lives. They are sometimes together, sometimes not, on that day.'One Day' has an interesting, ambitious idea, but David Nicholls's Screenplay, which is from his eponymous 2009 novel, is too busy to make you feel for its protagonists. The Writing never lets you settle in or give you the time to connect with the characters emotionally. Its all hurried & rushes in a neck-breaking speed. Lone Scherfig's Direction is strictly okay.Performance-Wise: Anne Hathaway & Jim Sturgess make 'One Day' watchable with their performances. Despite weak Writing, both of the talented actors commit themselves into their parts & perform exceedingly well. Rafe Spall is first-rate.On the whole, 'One Day' doesn't work.",One Day
9,blanbrn,A touch love drama of time that's touching due to it's lasting memory despite tragedy.,7,10 October 2011,"Over the summer I saw this film sure it's typical chick flick, still as a male I admire the beauty and sexy look of Anne Hathaway who I think is a brilliant actress. Plus I think she pulled the international accent off just fine in this film and as always her look is sharp and just fine. This is a love story that spans time with memories these moments touch you staying with you forever despite when an unexpected tragedy strikes.Set in England it involves a couple Em(Anne Hathaway) and Dexter(Jim Sturgess) and after this international couple graduates from college and meet and fall for one another on July 15, 1989. From every year on on this date it's considered an anniversary for this couple as the film shows the special moments that happened during the lives of both. As each year on the same day is highlighted you see that no matter what path their lives have taken love and memories draw them together.Overall this is a film of memory and everlasting love sadly an unexpected tragedy occurs, but still with memories Dexter will love Em forever as long as memories are around love can last forever. Probably not a great film but worth a watch for any Anne Hathaway fan.",One Day
10,Robert_duder,"Decent romance, if not just a little predictable, still a good date movie",7,17 January 2012,"I think it is fascinating and interesting that the majority of people...reviewers and others always describe this movie the same. They always say its the story of two friends/lovers who meet up on the same day every year. That is NOT what the movie is about. The unique spin of this movie is that we, the audience, see ONE DAY in the life of these two people, the same day, every year. They don't choose that day to meet, we just jump into that day...whatever they happen to be doing. The film is a sweet, often melodramatic romance film with decent performances, decent chemistry and an all around decent movie. There isn't anything wrong with the movie, but its two downfalls are that it is technically very predictable, bringing nothing truly new to the genre, and that everything about the movie is 'decent' without being outstanding. Ultimately One Day doesn't push the envelope of the genre.Two outstanding lead actors with only decent chemistry. Still Jim Sturgess is fantastic as wild child Dexter. He goes through some incredible transformations in the film as he matures and changes throughout the film. Sturgess really is a great actor and he is great in this movie. Anne Hathaway is a brilliant actress but I felt like this role for her was a little dull. Her performance is good but the character is shallow especially compared to Sturgess. Because of this, their chemistry between them is just okay and her English accent is more annoying than anything. She does okay with what she is given.I'm not sure director Lone Scherfig gave this film her all. Maybe she hasn't quite honed her craft as a director although she has lots of experience but I just felt like she could have done more with the cast and with the cinematography. All that aside the film is good, a solid date night movie, a lovely romance, and worth watching. It just isn't memorable and doesn't stick with you. It entertains and then leaves as fast as it comes. An average romance all around. 7/10",One Day
11,MLDinTN,"a fairly good story,,,",6,5 May 2012,"but still I don't buy you can tell a love story by showing what happens on one day, July 15, of every year. The film follows Emma and Dexter over a span of 20 plus years. They meet after graduating and go back to Emma's, but nothing romantic happens. They decide to keep in touch and be friends. Well, they turn out to be best friends even though their lives keep them apart. Emma becomes a waitress while trying to be a writer, and Dexter travels the world and eventually gets into the entertainment business.They each have loves and difficult times, but stay in touch and see each other when they can. Finally everything in their lives fall into place and they are ready to be together, but the story has a sad ending.FINAL VERDICT: It's meant to be tear jerker at the end. It was a neat idea, but I think too hard to pull off. I recommend for those that love romance stories.",One Day
12,inkblot11,"One day, soon, romance fans, try to view this nice film; others will probably be bored",7,5 January 2012,"Dexter (Jim Sturgess), rich kid on the verge of college graduation, meets Emma (Anne Hathaway), poor middle class student, on the eve of their graduations. A one-night stand occurs between the two. On the lovely Scottish morn that follows, each knows a romantic relationship will not begin. For one, Dex is a dedicated skirt-chaser, something Emma was aware of before their encounter. But, somehow, telephone numbers are exchanged and a long distance friendship begins. As a silver spoon gent, Dex lands a wild, crazy, and very lucrative job in television. Emma, who has aspirations to be a writer, slaves away in a Mexican restaurant for years before turning to teaching. Although they don't meet often, the two stay in touch, especially around June 15, the day they originally met. Each experiences other love journeys, with Dex even marrying another blueblood and having a little girl. Yet, as Emma and Dex mature, they begin to realize that their longterm friendship may have hidden depths. Will there be a future love connection for these two beings? This is quite a nicely romantic film, based on an equally fine book. For those who adore this type of drama, its a good watch. Sturgess and Hathaway are attractive and talented folks, although part of Emma's role is to be an ugly duckling at first. The supporting cast is good, with Patricia Clarkson having a small but expressive part as Dex's mother. Then, too, the British settings are most gorgeous and costumes, script, photography and direction are of a fine quality. Most importantly, the movie is an engrossing study of how the trials and triumphs of life shape the human spirit. A person of 30 is uniquely different from that same man or woman at 20, or 40 or 50. Young adult viewers will not appreciate this as much as older ones, who can reflect on their own pasts. Nevertheless, romance fans of all ages will take it to heart.",One Day
13,vincentlynch-moonoi,I walked away wondering -- what was the point that took nearly 2 hours?,6,12 July 2013,"I won't say it was agony, but it seemed awfully long sitting through this love (sort of) story last night when it was on cable. 108 minutes seems like a looooooong time when a story really is ultra simple: girl sorta falls in love with somewhat of a jerk...somewhat of a jerk turns into a total jerk...each goes their own way, but they keep in touch...total jerk realizes he actually loves the girl...they marry...and she is punished for loving total jerk by getting run over by a truck. Perhaps it was karma for her having loved such a jerk. That's it. That's the film.Some of the vignettes over the years are semi-interesting; others are not at all.I watched the film -- and stuck with it -- because I kinda like Anne Hathaway. However, this is hardly her finest hour. It is rather interesting how drab she in during her college years, and how she subtly becomes much more attractive as the film goes on.One of the problems here -- at least for me -- is that I found it difficult to like the male lead -- Jim Sturgess. Now part of that may have been his character, who was unlikable -- to one degree or another -- for 80% of the film. But I have a sneaking suspicion I might not like him in other films, either. Time will tell.I don't have much of a desire to see Rafe Spall in anything else, either; he played the sort-of-husband to Hathaway.Actually, some of the best moments came from the actors who played Sturgess' mother and father. The mother (Patricia Clarkson) was quite good...a nice balanced sort of person with some insight. The father (Ken Stott) seems rather drab early on, but his best scene is when -- after Hathaway dies -- his son, who is grieving, asks what his father expects him to do...just go on living? And his father says yes...that's what he's been doing since his wife's death. Such is life...for the old, and eventually for the young.I just know that I won't be watching this flick a second time.",One Day

15,tabuno,An Uneven Cute Attempt At Romantic Drama,7,17 January 2019,"20 June 2012. Sometimes an unusual idea can result in a fabulous outcome, but then again it can sometimes create a forced narrow limitations that somehow result in the sense of limited outcomes. With ""One Day,"" the exclusive focus on many ""one day of many years"" results in narrow slices, pieces of life of one day of two people that unfortunately is an overly ambitious attempt to depict a whole year of change and context within such a narrow window of observation that the movie becomes disjointed. Unlike Memento (2000) a crime thriller that takes singular scenes sliced up of a singular event and then presented in reserve chronological order or more pertinent, Sliding Doors (1998) a romantic drama that creatively uses a split editing of two parallel possible paths in the life of three people that in some ways presents the same storyline as One Day but with more connectivity and continuity. However, it can be said that One Day in some ways reflects a more authentic flash back of how people sometimes actually do experience their lives and reflect on their past and their present, may be too much so.The direction of One Day reveals the effort to avoid the clichés and stereotypes, but even so there are to many predictable and, yes, overused plot devices and even the ending has that second guessing aspect of the attempt to salvage the traditional romantic element that the scriptwriter may have been at odds in finding the right balance of emotive endings. City of Angels (1998) may have been one of the more difficult efforts in this romantic drama genre. If Only (2004) perhaps has the more focused but nevertheless powerful message of love turmoils and pains or The Bridges of Madison County (1995) has the more subtle but naturally unfolding nature of elusive love. Even Dr. Zhivago (1965) captured some of the greatest tensions and conflicts and intensity of love in the midst of an epic period film.There are admittedly flashes of brilliance and of creative inspiration in a number of the scenes in One Day and one can only imagined if such execution using a different more flexible framework might have resulted in an amazing and consistently enriching, compelling and more watchable film.",One Day
16,Floated2,Intriguing but lacking,4,23 June 2018,"Movies based on novels are usually different and can be difficult in keeping up with the source material. Not having read about the original novel or knowing anything about the material, opinion is based upon the film solely. One Day is quite similar to the Notebook in some sense but overall the film does do a good job at appealing to its demographic. The acting is decent but overall, as with many romantic comedies. Anne Hathway is likable as usually but Jim Sturgess character appears to be less (although he becomes better as the film passes). One Day is quite predictable at certain points. The completely ending and final scenes were most so different than expecting and not predictable though he story as a whole.One Day also somewhat reminded of (500) Days of Summer but that film as a whole was more complete in almost every aspect, as likable characters, plot, humor and overall engagement.

Fortunatelly the flash backs are a few and the story line is easier to follow that way. The director makes a great job by keeping us interested all through the movie, and the performance of the two protagonists are very good also.

One frankly poisonous bloke with his brains in his pants tries for 20 - odd years to seduce a girl he was at university with.
That,basically,is what ""One Day"" is all about.
It's not a love story for heaven sake,he is pathologically incapable of feeling so complex an emotion.
Except towards himself.
She wastes a significant proportion of her life waiting for him to change into a completely different person then,quite inexplicably decides she'll take him on as he is.Maybe she is hearing her biological clock.ticking.
Whatever,she dumps her French jazz pianist boyfriend so quickly he hardly has time to learn the melodic minor scale.
The device on which ""One Day"" hangs is so flimsy I lost interest very early on.
It might have been more winning if the writer had made the ""One Day"" the 29th February - at least it would have been over sooner.
All you need to know about the characters is that they play the terribly posh game ""Are you there,Moriarty"",an Oxbridge version of Blind Man's Buff with added violence .
Under the guise of which the seriously unpleasant guy smacks his girlfriend very hard in the face with a rolled up newspaper,causing her nose to bleed.
She(the lovely Romelai Garai - by far the best performance)still marries him and has his baby.

21,estebangonzalez10,"Terrible first half, decent second half",5,26 April 2012,"¨Whatever happens tomorrow, we had today.¨ One Day is Danish director, Lone Scherfig's, follow up to 2009 film An Education; a movie I really liked, but unfortunately this film isn't as interesting. One Day is a romantic film with two characters that I had a difficult time believing they were actually best friends or in love with each other. My major problem however was with Hathaway's British accent. I have no idea why they didn't just get a British actress to play the role considering there are some many great ones. Jim Sturgess is a decent actor, but I just didn't feel the chemistry between him and Hathaway. The key in a romantic film lies in the chemistry between the two main actors and I just didn't feel it. The story is interesting and the premise seemed original considering we only get to see a glimpse of what happens during one day (July 15th) of every year. Due to these constraints we do have to fill in a lot of gaps of things that have happened during the time, but the film does a good job at telling the story. I actually enjoyed the second half of the film, but I felt that the first half was just too slow and boring. I am glad however that I decided to stick with the film because it does get a lot better in the second half, although I still wouldn't recommend this film, unless you are a true fan of the genre.The movie opens with a scene that takes place on July 15th of 2006; Emma (Anne Hathaway) is riding a bicycle in a street in London when all of a sudden we move back about 20 years to the late 80's on July 15th where we see how Emma and Dexter (Jim Sturgess) meet. They are celebrating their graduation and end up spending a night together although they never had talked much in school before. They become real good friends and we see how their lives develop as every day we jump forward in time one year on that exact date. Dexter becomes a late night television star, while Emma despite being intelligent struggles to make it through. Their friendship continues to grow and Dexter is always telling Emma how soon she will become a famous writer. As the movie progresses we are introduced to new cities and meet some secondary characters as Emma and Dexter don't see each other every year on that day. We are introduced to Dexter's parents, Alison (Patricia Clarkson) and Steven (Ken Stott) and to some of Dexter and Emma's love interests. Despite being away from each other they continue to be in touch and at times even travel together. We experience how these friends grow, the challenges they face, and the goals they achieve.One Day is actually based on the bestselling novel written by David Nicholls. The great thing about it is that Scherfig got him to adapt the screenplay for this movie as well. This is one of those stories that probably work best in a novel because several details have to be left out of the film due to time constraints. I really wished the movie would have had a more entertaining first half because it does pick up pretty well during the second half. I also enjoyed some of the secondary characters like Patricia Clarkson who is always a great addition to a movie. One Day is a decent romantic film, but I think Scherfig did a much better job in An Education. This is not a memorable movie, it lacks better pacing, but it does have some decent performances.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com",One Day

23,cekadah,"finely acted, nicely photographed, well paced - but sentimental glop",6,30 March 2013,"from my title it appears i did not like this movie - actually i did like it. as stated the acting, photography, music, and flow of the plot kept me watching.but all through the movie i kept waiting to see what was going to happen for the inevitable tragedy - and as much as i hate to say this - it was almost comical when it happened! throughout this entire story you just can't bring yourself to actually 'care' for any of the principle actors. so their personal ups & downs are just another step to how this story will end.then the movie ends with our male lead looking no older in the face but with a full head of gray hair. the story covers almost 20 years and nobody ages!!! OK - i'll give it that some people don't show their age but after these people's lives they would show some age.my suggestion to someone seeking a 'love story with no real bumps along the way' - get this flick. it's just right and within 10 minutes you will forget how it ended.",One Day
24,juneebuggy,A Harry Met Sally ish romance,8,1 April 2015,"I was a huge fan of the book by David Nicholls and really looked foreword to seeing this... And while it didn't quite live up to my expectations and somewhat failed to capture the love and tragedy of the novel it was still a decent enough romance.The lovely Jim Sturgess plays rich playboy Dexter, with the (mostly irritating) Anne Hathaway as working class woman Em. We join them in 1988 on the night of their college graduation where they almost get together, decide to be friends and then proceed to follow them over the course of the next two decades.We see them through assorted relationships, phone calls, fights, hopes, vacations, missed opportunities, laughter and tears. There is always the anticipation of, will these two ever get together? The tone of the movie is different than the book, trying to be a bit like 'When Harry Met Sally' and failing. I also didn't ever feel the connection between Dexter and Em. I guess I should stop comparing the two, apples and oranges and all that but when you adore a book as much as I did its hard.The ageing of the characters is very well done here, subtle but especially apparent at the very end when the movie flips back to the night they met and you go wow, look how young they were. The clothing is also true to the decade and there are some fun (bad) hairstyles. 1/4/15",One Day
25,EUyeshima,Contrived Flipbook of a Film Focuses on Disconnected Soul Mates,3,22 August 2011,"As someone who counts Stanley Donen's ""Two for the Road"" as one of his all-time favorite films, I was hoping this 2011 romantic drama might transcend its time-spanning gimmick of using one day every year – July 15 – as the touchstone for a couple who appear destined for happiness together but not without a lot of emotional curveballs and unforeseen detours. It doesn't. In fact, the film's structural conceit heightens the contrivances that keep the viewer from fully investing in the fate of what the filmmakers would like us to believe are soul mates. It's really impossible to calibrate why this mismatched pair continues to connect over the years other than to fulfill the cardboard dimensions of David Nicholls' verbose screenplay, which is in turn based on his 2009 book. The lugubrious result makes for particularly disappointing cinema given that the film was directed by Danish filmmaker Lone Scherfig, who helmed Carey Mulligan's star-making turn in the far more satisfying ""An Education"" (2009).The story begins on the night of July 15, 1988 when recent Edinburgh University graduates Emma Morley and Dexter Mayhew end up spending the night together. She comes from a working-class background and is consequently smart and caustic but insecure as evidenced by the pair of granny glasses she constantly wears. He comes from money and has the cocky manner befitting someone whose shallow aim in life is to become famous since he's already rich. They connect for no apparent reason from the outset and start a friendship that borders on codependency. We see them every year thereafter on the same day as they grow from young adulthood to early middle age. Emma stumbles out of the gate becoming increasingly depressed working at a Mexican restaurant in London. Dexter finds fame as the sleazy host of a VH1-type entertainment-lite program. She eventually finds her footing as a writer, while he goes through a drug-induced tailspin. Their up-and-down lives intertwine at defining moments when something decisive happens to one, and the other has to cope with whatever the new situation is. The film repeats this pattern so often that it becomes redundant and tiresome even when an inevitable plot device occurs late in the story.I can see why an actress as engaging as Anne Hathaway would be drawn to a part like Emma because she gets to play a wide range of shades and emotions in her character's arc, but there are two things that are off-kilter about her performance. First, her pinched English accent sounds entirely too close to her take-off of Mary Poppins from her guest appearance on ""Saturday Night Live"" to be believable. Second, her naturally vibrant presence doesn't lend credibility to the early scenes when she appears to be doing a cheeky throwback to the first ""Princess Diaries"" movie. She also makes co-star Jim Sturgess (Jude in ""Across the Universe"") look all the more pallid as the pitiable Dexter. He seems to be channeling Hugh Grant in order to evoke the charm necessary to attract Emma, but he suffers even more from the story's thumbnail-sketch approach. As Emma's failed love interest Ian, Rafe Spall is convincingly annoying as an aspiring stand-up comic without any talent, while Romola Garai has the thankless role of Dexter's humorless lover-turned-wife. Both appear to be playing stock characters for the sake of the central love story. At least Patricia Clarkson lends her requisite élan as Dexter's worldly mother, but her scenes are all too brief. Despite a clever time-shifting scene at Arthur's Seat in Edinburgh, the film left me dry-eyed wanting to see ""Two for the Road"" again.",One Day
26,dierregi,The melancholy of growing up,7,17 April 2012,"This movie could be described by a cynic as a Nicholas Sparks'story for younger generations. However, I think a more apt description is a love story that does not try to be a fairy tale.Our main characters – Dexter and Emma - spend a night together after graduation and then start a life-long relationship. First as friends and then as something more. We are shown them together only one day in their lives. This does not mean they meet only once a year – as somebody misinterpreted.They go on with their lives, spending time together and time apart and we are shown how their relationship develops in the course of 20 years. While Dexter starts big and then is hit by disappointments and failure, Emma follows a different path.We are shown their sentimental blunders and the difficulties of growing up. It is a rather honest depiction of what life takes away from our young selves and what is replaced by dubious gifts, such as maturity.I guess some negative remarks were motivated by the melancholic sincerity of the movie. It can be hard to accept that the path of life is not one of infinite growth and that nobody is spared by sorrow. Not even people in love.Much was written about Hathaway accent, but I did not care in the least. Hers and Sturgess interpretations are more than acceptable, in what can be considered a fine romantic drama.",One Day

It's a decidedly unusual premise that's employed to consistently enthralling effect by filmmaker Lone Scherfig, as the director, working from David Nicholls' script, deftly transforms Emma and Dexter into likable, engaging figures right from the get-go - which, in effect, does force the viewer to immediately sympathize with and root for the would-be couple's ongoing exploits. The palpable chemistry between Hathaway and Sturgess undoubtedly plays a pivotal role in the movie's success, and there's little doubt that the episodic nature of the narrative, which admittedly does take some getting used to, ultimately proves instrumental in cultivating a remarkably complete picture of the ups and downs in the protagonists' lives. By the time the unabashedly tear-jerking finale rolls around, One Day has certainly established itself as an uncommonly captivating, thoroughly moving romance that stands among the best that the genre has to offer.",One Day

30,napierslogs,"By sticking to the novel, the movie loses the connection to the characters",6,19 August 2011,"""One Day"", based on the novel of the same name, is the relationship of two people, Emma (Anne Hathaway) and Dexter (Jim Sturgess), as we see it on July 15th of each year. As can be expected from the nature of the story, it's a little dry, lacking in comedy. But then again, it's a romantic drama, not a romantic comedy.As is the nature of the two media, movies can never be exactly the same as the novel. But the problem with this one is that they tried to; no story lines were removed. Almost everything was there, just shortened into mostly meaningless segments. I personally could have done with one less event in their lives, and perhaps a different ending, but they tried to be as faithful as possible.What we have here is a movie about a relationship, but the novel was about the people. They traded in character depth and development so we can see them in their more attractive years falling in and out of love.I wasn't very familiar with Jim Sturgess, having seen him play skinny, slightly nerdy, not as confident kids. Dexter is a different breed of guy. Just has high on self-confidence as he is on drugs and alcohol, he gets by on his looks – literally – he's a TV host. Although the different characteristics of Dexter weren't explicitly shown in the movie, Sturgess brought them out in him perfectly. Emma is a more complex character, with significant evolution to who she is throughout the years, except none of that is in the movie, so it just wasn't really possible for Hathaway to portray her as a more interesting person.I would assume that watching ""One Day"" without the benefit of having read the novel would be a fairly confusing, empty experience. With the background that the novel gave me, I could fill in all the missing years and the unexplored layers to the characters, so there was still something to their relationship for me.",One Day
31,TheUnknown837-1,"Jim Sturgess and Anne Hathaway look well enough together, but their chemistry is only superficial",6,24 November 2011,"Being the big sucker for slushy romance movies that I am, not finding much liking for ""One Day"" proved a jolting surprise for me. I admit, I had some pretty high expectations for this film after reading the plot description and because I have great respect for the talents of the two leads. Should I choose to watch the movie a second time, I might enjoy it a little more, but I doubt enough to recommend it to anybody, since it really does not accomplish much and didn't convince even me of the love between the characters. And remember, I'm the guy who praised the living daylights out of ""At First Sight."" Granted, that's a remarkable, criminally underrated movie, but onto ""One Day.""I have not read the David Nicholls book upon which this film is based, but I will take it that his strength is in witty banter, for he uses it efficiently in his own adapted screenplay. Maybe he did better in four or five hundred pages of text in his book, but in this hour and forty-some minutes of images, he seems to struggle with characterization and chemistry. In the film, two British college graduates (Anne Hathaway and Jim Sturgess) whimsically share a bed the night after graduation and promise to stay in touch afterward, but exclusively as best friends. The day they met was July 15th, 1989. The movie continually pushes forward exactly one year up into the 21st century, with them sometimes bumping into each other, sometimes not, but never once forgetting their relationship, even as they find themselves in the arms of others.Despite some fine ideas, ""One Day"" is too bloated and pompous for its own good. Mr. Strugess and Miss Hathaway act well (if you can ignore the latter's uncomfortable attempt at a British accent, as I eventually taught myself to) and look good together, but the only chemistry they have is superficial. They ogle, they banter, they embrace, they kiss, and it's all movements and shots taken right out of other slushy romantic films from yesteryear. There is no visceral sense of love between the two of them and I found it to be a real challenge really caring whether or not they got together at the end. As required for a film like this, there are plenty of subplots about other lovers, ex-wives, dying parents, and so on and frankly, if any or all of these predicaments blocked the two from reconciling and being together, it would not have made a difference, for at that time I still would have given up caring.The directing by Lone Scherfig is quite good. I particularly liked her uses of mirrors in important scenes, but the cinematography by Benoit Delhomme is much too gloomy, too washed-out and devoid of spark. They both do a good job of avoiding an overuse of wide shots (which in turn would bring up the ""televisionization"" syndrome) but not bringing life to the images. The seldom-heard music by Rachel Portman is hardly worth writing home about, either. And the makeup work, done to create the illusion of the characters growing older, works magnificently for Miss Hathaway and not-so-well for Mr. Sturgess, who starts to look like a high school One-Act ""old man"" toward the end of the picture.Hardly bad but instantly forgettable, ""One Day"" only scores with some occasionally nice moments when Mr. Sturgess or Miss Hathaway are alone, separate from each other and the other characters. These are two enormously talented people adored by the camera who frankly would make a wonderful screen-couple but deserve a strong, more sharply-composed story to work with.",One Day

33,tim-764-291856,St Swithin's Day (recurring....),6,17 September 2012,"At first I was rather annoyed by both Em's prudishness and Dex's public school playboy persona's, but as they meet up every 15th July for St Swithin's day, we do warm to them. Their influences on each other soften the worst of these two personality traits, even though I still found Jim Sturgess (Dex) rather unlikable through to the end. Anne Hathaway, as Em, dons a perfect English accent though some of her straight-laced manners are a little stereotyped (bookish glasses, long, dull dresses etc)Meeting at Uni and after a fling that doesn't really happen, through a series of time-signposted snapshots, we see them re-uniting, either in person or by phone. He moved to Paris, has always got a girl of some sort and is often drunk or in some kind of trouble.

However, the various locations - England and France - have a certain resonance and place and familiarity, of course, which is sort of comforting. I did find the satellite characters often more interesting than the main pair - Dex's parents, for example. Patricia Clarkson as his mum and Ken Stott as dad; she wise and loving but cancer-ridden and he, hasty, brusque and forthright - typical of so many real parents.The film pretty much follows this vein throughout though their fortunes and life-courses are swapped around and changed. After relationship difficulties for them both, could they ever get back together as a proper couple? I won't say anything much about the end except perhaps that life itself is key to what happens to us and not screenwriters and romanticists.Whilst being slightly 'icky' at times, this was nonetheless a fairly enjoyable movie experience but not one I'd particularly want to see again. I'd give it nearer 6.5/10 than the 6 I clicked on and whilst Hathaway has done a good job and was fairly memorable, the rest is pretty much standard, if slightly above average romantic drama.",One Day

We follow their lives throughout the next 20 years, on that exact day, how they evolve as differently as the characters' personality is, and what they do to survive in the harsh world, separated.It's a movie which has an interesting premise which it tries to elaborate and build the whole action on it, but unfortunately fails to create something interesting, something that may keep the viewer interested throughout the entire length. Instead, was resulted was a series of boring, almost ordinary events, which were almost predictable and which lead to an unexpected but also unsatisfying finale. Yes, it has good characters and good actor performance, but what happens with them isn't interesting in almost any way.

Brilliant locations, beautiful cinematography, Anne Hathaway delivers a good performance,The bad. The editor and the director failed to establish a believable connection between the two lead actors as to why they would form a lasting bond that would carry them over 20 years. We're given a hint of this at the end but that doesn't help or fix the rest of the movie, so that's the bad editing aspect of this. if this scene had been at the front it might have helped sell the movie. That that scene didn't really deliver the goods needed to make it believable is the directors mistake along with many of the other scenes that tips the scale against the characters. Too many scenes of Dexter being a jerk and not enough of him being in anyway lovable or charming, even though there was much amusement to be had in the jerk Dexter scenes they blew out the balance of his character and it wasn't till the end that we got to see him as anything less than a jerk, but by then it was too late and it didn't really do anything to alter the confusion of why Emma would have cared. I also didn't buy Jim Sturgess performance, although a lot of people think differently, he came across as a caricature rather than a character. People have criticised Anne Hathaway's accent and there's probably some weight to that but I personally didn't find it annoying once I thought what's going on with her accent as it fluctuated all over the show. That's a continuity and a direction flaw as much as it is her performance. After a few mins I put it in the multi-sourced accent file as many people have blended accents. Outside of that Anne's delivering some really good depth in her work so much so that we may one day forgive her for the princess diaries.",One Day
36,Likes_Ninjas90,Do not consider this as a date movie. You will not be popular.,4,24 August 2011,"In the late 80s a girl named Emma (Anne Hathaway) is a college student who meets fellow graduate Dexter (Jim Sturgess). They're about to sleep together one evening but decide to remain friends instead. Over the course of twenty years we see how circumstances and other people have kept them divided when they just want to be together. Dexter finds himself hosting a ghastly television show, while being warned by his sick mother (Patricia Clarkson) that he isn't a particularly nice person anymore. He insists that he just wants to have fun, despite being critically panned and moving between women. Emma works her way up from a job in a fast food restaurant, to a teacher and then eventually into a successful author. To the distress of Dexter she has a serious relationship with an obnoxious comedian, which puts her real desires on hold. Late in the timeline, Dexter is married rather unhappily and has a baby girl to look after. An unlikeable leading man makes this one day too many. It's impossible to say what type of movie One Day is. It postures as a comedy but it barely raises a single laugh. And though it also lacks dramatic impact for much of its length too, its one climax is so shocking and over the top that it will leave a sour taste in your mouth. Do not consider this as a date movie. You will not be popular. You also have to wonder late in the movie what the point was. Director Lone Scherfig (An Education, 2009) tries to end things on a very syrupy note. That's very nice for one of the characters but unrewarding for the audience who have waded through twenty years in the lives of these unappealing characters for nothing. The message is ultimately a very obvious, unoriginal and simple one: that life pulls people in opposite directions but happiness can be found in one single moment. Using an extended chronological structure is a gimmick. It allows for little on screen titles to appear in the frame, just like in (500) Days of Summer (2009) but it refuses to enrich character. A film like Blue Valentine (2010) is infinitively more intelligent because it realises that character is structure. It contrasts the past and present day to visualise the changing personalities of its leads and the impact on their relationship. The script by David Nicholls, adapting his own novel, lacks this kind of sophistication. Having the film move through such an extensive period suggests that there will be arching transformations in the characters. But unfortunately Sturgess remains continuously unlikeable all throughout this movie. His character is arrogant, rude, promiscuous and irresponsible. And briefly touching on his fractured relationship with his parents does not make him anymore sympathetic. Patricia Clarkson is barely in this movie because she has so few scenes and I wasn't moved by her appearances as the film intended. One of the golden rules of the romantic comedy is broken here: you don't understand why Emma and Dexter belong together. This is a detriment to the film's plotting and the motives of the characters. We're left wondering what this apparently sophisticated woman continues to see in this buffoon, especially when she's already with better company. Even after that huge climax Dexter still has a moment of madness. Only at the very end does he wake up to himself. The actors aren't really to blame. Anne Hathaway is such a pleasant actress in almost everything she does, comedy or otherwise. But this sketchy, underwritten role wastes her talents and doesn't stretch her chops at all. She's made to look dorky and uptight with her over-sized glasses, only to move into little but quirkiness. And Jim Sturgess who I liked in Across the Universe (2007) and The Way Back (2010) is gifted too, with no shortage of personality. He just happens to be playing a real jerk. If that's what he intended, he certainly succeeded. As far as the rebirth of frank romantic-comedies goes this is a pretty uninspired and limp entry.",One Day

40,Ali_John_Catterall,Massive Fail,8,19 August 2011,"Yes, entirely predictably (well, you probably guessed as much from the trailer), they made an utter pig's ear of it. The Good:As Dex, Jim Sturgess is decent - nails the look, and the accent (both of them). Rafe Spall, as hapless wannabe comedian Ian is also fine - although there isn't a scintilla of genuine anguish about him when he's dumped, but hey, it's not his story right? (To be honest, it's a wonder they didn't simply represent him with a balloon on a stick.)It does have a few reflective moments of stillness, which are incredibly welcome - mostly concerning Dex and family (if the book was arguably slanted more towards Emma's side of the story, here it favours Dex) - but they're all too rare.The Bad:All too rare, because this one zips along like it's left the iron on (no mean feat in an 108 minute movie), galloping toward the denouement so that any emotional investment we might have made in it is almost completely wiped out. 1997, for example, literally lasts a swimming pool length. I know book-to-film adaptations bowdlerise to an extent, but this is absolutely ridiculous. There's also an argument to be made about the wisdom of letting writers adapt their own screenplays. Perhaps some sense of objectivity is lost in the process. Oddly enough, a previous David Nicholls' TV mini-series called 'I Saw You', starring Fay Ripley, is practically a warm-up for One Day, and is absolutely wonderful - very worth tracking down. That was in three parts. If the makers of One Day hadn't been so concerned with making a quick buck (usual story), this would have benefited from a mini-series of its own. But then, of course, there's no money in Telly.At its worst, the film's truncation manifests in a reliance on phone calls between the pair, which makes it seem as if Sturgess is frankly *stalking* Anne Hathaway. *That* twist, at least, is intact, and somewhat shocking. But in the same way a sudden glimpse of a mink being flayed alive in the middle of a Disney cartoon might be.Couldn't they have found one single British actress for crying out loud? Yes, I know only too well about the need for overseas investment. But you're not looking at Anne Hathaway thinking, 'working-class Northener' you're distractedly thinking, 'Isn't that... Anne Hathaway, working in a Tex Mex restaurant in Camden?'Romola Garai, who plays Sophie, would have done better - dressed-down a bit. (Or as often suggested, Carey Mulligan.) And how do they pull off Hathaway being only subtly attractive? Oversize specs. Because, you know, specs always make people look *dowdy*, apparently. I'm not even going to talk about her accent. You've heard it. It ranges from Angela's Ashes to... well, to Hathaway's own American accent, in fact.The Ugly:The more I think about this, the crosser I get. Film Emma never has any tawdry affairs, as in the novel, as it wouldn't suit her martyred character - and it wouldn't suit the fragrant Hathaway. A layered, interesting character becomes a 2-dimensional pouter; pure and nun-like. Just waiting around for Dexter to be ready, waiting for him to finally come around, and save her tormented soul. It's repulsive, actually - and *totally* a betrayal of her character and the spirit of the original. In short, it's not the very worst film in the world - it's just completely and utterly unremarkable; Sub-Richard Curtis, which is something this lovely and moving book just isn't.",One Day

The acting is fine enough...after all Anne Hathaway is a wonderful actress you just can't hate. The acting isn't the problem here...the subject material is. Basically it is the story of two immature people who flounder through life, one in meaningless relationships, the other in destructive relationships and finally decide, ""What the heck, let's try it together."" It's like watching a train wreck about to happen for 16 years or so and then they crash.

44,akcenat,Hearty and loving adaptation of a David Nicholls' 2009 novel,8,9 April 2020,"""One Day"" conveys a real sense of the poignancy of individual lives unfolding over time. A. Hathaway delivers very solid performance, although she looks older than J. Sturgess and the two of them lack the sparkling chemistry when compared to the book. At times they look like more as two old friends, then two (budding) lovers. On the other side, Sturgess is impressive with his portrayal of Dexter, but as movie goes forward the script seems to stretch thinner and thinner. Yet, sometimes all it takes to make or break a film is the ending, and for me ending of ""One Day"" was perfect. Highly recommended.Rating: 8+",One Day
45,diac228,Warning: Keep Film Away From Sharp Objects,4,20 August 2011,"This movie had plenty of potential. Surely it was a consistently grim and depressing film but the themes about love and the main cast kept us interested. This movie had potential in which the aura of hope was strong enough to keep us wanting to see a nice resolution---in the midst of the depression. One Day could have been a wonderful film about love and friendship across different fields of time and distance—something that only the film Before Sunset accomplished in every degree imaginable. And then came the third act. That bloody awful third act.One Day is a film that was running a certain direction, and then totally flips the switch in the final third of the movie, resulting in a jumbled mess of inconsistent themes, inconsistent pace, and just a story that seems like its only goal is to drive the audience to tears and suicidal thoughts. While it was accurately faithful to the book, sometimes this is a bad thing as novels do have their pitiful moments (See: No Country For Old Men). Worst of all, the screenplay was from the author so any hope of changing some of the material or some of the extremely weak parts of the novel were pretty much dead and gone.This movie is about a friendship between two characters that spans three different decades, and we the viewer see where they are in their lives as they meet each other on the same day every year. Despite their scenario and financial/martial/emotional status, they find a way to see each other to catch up. Like I said before, the script was from the same writer as the 2009 novel, David Nicholls. Nicholls had a fresh concept a fresh twist to the romantic drama genre, but in order to keep one step ahead of the reader he shifts gears in the final moments of the novel—winding up with a book I would most likely wind up hating. And all those events lead to a script that I wound up hating.The 2011 Summer Season has been a very disappointing one, but we've had great performances left and right that have saved certain films (Bad Teacher) and propelled others to new heights (Horrible Bosses). Anne Hathaway and Jim Sturgess kept my interest in the movie, as they delivered fine performances that chronicled them at their happiest and at their downright most depressed. Sturgess had a lot more to work with because of the events on his side and he handled them quite tell. Hathaway despite using an accent (not necessary if you ask me) also did a fine job, and being a naturally beautiful woman had to find a way to look unattractive and unappealing to the audience—meaning she also had to do some tough work. The rest of the cast did a decent job, but our main stars kept the film afloatuntil the third act.Lone Scherfig, who directed the under-the-radar Oscar bait An Education, did quite well in spite of the frustrating material she was dealt with. She handled her shots quite well, and sometimes let the visuals describe the emotions and mindset of our main characters. Sadly Scherfg's direction was marred by the editing, which oddly left out some vital material, and shuffled around some scenes awkwardly. If your movie is being done in chronological order, why mess that up in the final act? Why skip out some of the better character-relationship-building scenes, only to use them for the final act, once their relationship has already been established? I'm telling you, this third act is poison.Bottom Line: An ending can make or break a movie; it can erase some of the shortcomings in the first two acts, or ultimately weaken the entire structure of the film. One Day's final act will leave you frustrated, will leave you upset, and it's not just because of the events that happen, but in the manner that they are presented. Everything you were learning about the movie, all the lessons and themes and nice moments the script was giving us are flung out of the window in favor of an unexpected finale that crushes the soul of the entire body of work. The ending of this review will remain consistent with the rest of the article: Do not watch unless you are a fan of depression or subpar material.",One Day

The problem with only showing the characters on one day per year is that it's incomplete and the change in the characters isn't sufficiently explained. This film is like an inferior remake of When Harry Met Sally - minus the humour and with an unhappy ending.The two aren't suited as a couple or as friends - and the attraction between them isn't believable. Neither of the main two characters are likable, so we can't root for them - or care when she is killed.Anne Hathaway's character, and her many changes in appearance and voice, aren't believable.

48,Rockwell_Cronenberg,A disaster on every level.,1,24 November 2011,"After the poor trailers and even poorer reviews, I wasn't expecting anything from this film but the interesting premise still motivated me to watch it. As anticipated, it was a trainwreck essentially from the start. For starters, it's structured all wrong; it feels so rushed through in a large part, with a lot of the focus only being on three or four days over the course of two decades. Of course with that being said, it never even feels like two decades have past. They change the actors looks slightly and I like that they didn't try to go overboard with the makeup and everything, but they look too old at the beginning and way too young at the end.What's worse though is that it doesn't feel like the time progresses at all. It feels like you're watching a day-by-day story as opposed to one that passes over years. I think the structure messes this up, but I also have to put fault on the actors for this. In the later years they should feel like the same people who have lived the experiences we've seen throughout the film, but they really don't. It's like they read the scenes for each new year and decided to play the characters differently in each year.I really wish that Sturgess would live up to the potential I think he has, but he keeps choosing awful roles and as his counterpoint Anne Hathaway is as awful as ever. People put way too much focus on judging accents as the key to a performance, but her accent is so off the charts absurd here it borders on hilarious. She goes through at least three different accents, just in one scene. An interesting premise, but practically everyone dropped the ball here. A real shame from Lone Scherfig, coming off the sensational An Education.",One Day
49,webmaster-3017,HK Neo Reviews: One Day,7,1 February 2012,"""Whatever happens tomorrow, we had today."" This is a great example of how to make a good movie. Along the lines of Before Sunset or After Sunrise, One Day is essentially about one's journey through life's ups and downs and the love we encountered along the way. Anne Hathaway is once again pitch perfect and her chemistry with would-be lover Jim Sturgess is just dazzling to watch. It is one of those films where even though the two aren't together, you feel that somehow they are just meant to be. Life is a like a big piece of puzzle and sometimes, it takes a long time before you finally realise how to finish off the puzzle. It can be that simple and also that weird at the same time. One Day gives you the sweet, the bitter, the mysterious, the delightful, the downs of one's life journey. Directed by Lone Scherfig, the person behind the outstanding An Education, One Day uses one simple plot device of showing the same day for 15 years and in the process drives the audience to the conclusion. This is a simple gimmick that works to its maximum potential. Perhaps the only real problem is that the film lacks ambition and the originality that made An Education a much more unique and finer picture. One Day seems to rely more on the attractiveness and the greatness of the acting duo to push the film above being yet another love story. What makes the film work simply the director ability to make the audience keep wanting to know more, understand more and see more about the couple's fate.All in all, One Day is never a film that reaches for the stars, or the wow factor, but rather is happy enough to stay within the defined boundaries within its own plot devices and heavily reliance on the actors' performances. That's not to say it is entirely a bad thing, but after a great film such as An Education, one just expect that little more. Still, One Day is more than enjoyable enough experience to recommend sitting through one screening and in terms of the genre, you can certainly do a lot worst. A delightful film that capture your attention Neo rates it 7.5/10",One Day
50,yris2002,lovely,7,13 November 2011,"Since from the trailer we know what kind of movie we are going to see: a romantic, sentimental movie, with some melodramatic hints, and, indeed, that's exactly the movie I saw and wanted to see. It offers a good structure, nice locations, from Edinburgh to London, to some French seaside settings, some humour now and then, with the always enjoyable and not so common merit of avoiding vulgarity and too easy sexuality. Acting proves also convincing, a good chemistry between Anne Hathaway and Jim Sturgess is to be appreciated, the first one credible in her (not new, indeed) change from an ugly duckling to a refined swan, the latter credible in his predictable but appreciable shift from a spoiled womanizer to a wiser grown-up. The unpredictable finale introduces some back-to-reality element, saving the picture from what could have been too a romantic and slushy hotchpotch, but the risk of becoming such is in the end intelligently avoided.

I think the fact that it is written by a man may be one reason that this is a love story guys will enjoy as much as girls.The story itself is not exactly epic or even original, but the film is classy, technically brilliant, and the two leads elevate it above most love stories I've seen - and I watch 3-4 films a day on average.Sturgess plays the part perfectly from graduate to 40-something, one of the finest performances I've seen in such a role. Hathaway is delightful as usual, and her English accent is one of the best I've heard from an American, although she doesn't seem to know whether her character is from the north or the south! The story is predictable of course, but the brutal twist may still make you jump out of your seat - it did me. That's no excuse for lots of gushing sentimentality, and fortunately we don't get that here.Where 90% of films fall down is with the ending, but this plays out perfectly and doesn't leave you wanting more or with unanswered questions.

54,ferdinand1932,Quality clichés,3,6 January 2012,"In a work that lacks any originality whatsoever the one saving grace for the producers is that they did not have to test the film with audiences before release. Every element, plot, storyline and characterization are so well established as to be a bland puree of other people's ideas and for the most part, better done than what is on offer here.This is a mode of work that evolved on the Nineties: it's the light weight, almost magazine style, of novel and film. It's very contemporary but also very stale as it has nothing to say. Its appeal is quick and facile.To disguise the inherent artistic failure, the production is made to look quite pleasing. Plenty of nice locations, production design etc but the jokes are flat, the dialog predictable, the arc of the story foreseen an act ahead. The resolution gives it a deceptively serious and emotional depth it really never had and tacking one on as this attempts never lifts it above the cliché it always was.",One Day

Just like 'Time Travellers Wife"", the scripting required adjustments and they were made in the name of time and entertainment. I did think the story was somewhat pedestrian and ploddy for the first half hour but when the separation occurred and they started to live their separate lives, the characters came more to life and seemed less 'wooden'.Nothing bad about the movie, the flow of dialogue is good, the cinema clips (cinemaotophy?) is befitting for the film and Anne Hathaway gives a first class acting performance, make no mistake.Love Story movies always have twists and so does this.

It is the why this film, spanning twenty three years in the lives of Emma (Hathaway) and Dexter, works and carries us along the wave of anticipation through all the climaxes and anti climaxes. It is crafted to try to get us to see what doesn't change in all that appears to change, and it works commendably.There is great chemistry between Hathaway and Sturgess but the latter is not as good on screen without her at his side.

59,achyutaghosh,Love story of the year!,8,23 November 2011,"Disclaimer first up- biased review, as I am a sucker for love stories.I used to think that Hollywood had stopped making emotionally involving love stories. Thank god they made One Day, then. Based on the best selling book by British author Dave Nicholls, the movie explores the intertwined lives of two protagonists of contrasting nature, yet fated to be together. The premise is novel, with the relationship explored though a peek into 15th July of each year, spread over 22 years. Good stories are brought to life by good acting, and here we have two superb exponents in lead roles- Jim Sturgess as Dexter and Anna Hathaway as Emma. Dexter leads the high profile life, a television anchor with success in all forms chasing him, always. But then his life is also hollow, his friends shallow, and in the end, a faces disillusionment and compromise. Emma dwells in obscurity mostly, but through sheer tenacity and belief achieves a modicum of success as a writer. They meet when they are 18, decide to remain lifelong friends, and they do remain so. In the meanwhile meandering through the vagaries of life, they are inexorably drawn towards each other, dependent on each other.Childhood sweethearts, even if long lost, when they do come together, they do get together without any questions asked- i say this having witnessed the same on a close friend of mine. And you cant help but fall in love with Emma and Dexter- their love story is so compelling and adorable, that you become a part of their story, you care for them, you laugh with them, and also cry, you want them to do what you would do, and yes, you desperately want a happy ending for them.And of course there is Anna Hathaway-suitably rumpled and grunge in the first half, and elegance and grace personified in the second, when she flashes her pearly whites, the world seems to be a better place to live.Why do people in love get to be in love in the best of locations? One Day happens in picturesque Edinburgh, colourful London, and stylish Paris. And the best thing that makes it stand out among all love stories is that it is not predictable, till the very end.

I got it in this movie, for the leads: Emma Morley (Anne Hatheway) and Dexter Mayhew (Jim Sturgis) fall in love and (an unusually long time later) finally declare their love and get together.Then I was awakened by the reality of the rest of the plot and realized the drawn out relationship of the leads who, somehow meet or think of each other every July 15th for decades, took place for a reason.It was as if the writer had seen numerous romantic drama movies and romantic comedy movies (let's call them all romance movies as a catchall phrase) before and decided to hit us with an unexpected twist. The key to writing a romance movie is where you end it. In romance movies, You are supposed to indicate they lived happily ever after, by ending it when they declare their love (or re-declare it) and hinting that it was forever. Not realistic, because nothing lasts forever. Everybody dies and no one lives forever. However, this movie's structure is similar to Wuthering Heights in that one of the lovers dies, and therefore, violates the concept of the romantic movie, with some reality.The movie also leaves one thinking about missed opportunities, because of the couple near-the-end scenes, which explain the reason it takes so long for the romantic leads to finally get together. Then in the final scene, the movie wraps with an ending like the ending of the old movie Wuthering Heights.Despite the fact that the ending of this movie does not provoke the great feel concept of numerous romantic movies like: The Apartment, When Harry Met Sally, As Good As It Gets, all and ll it is a thought provoking romantic movie, spliced with reality.

Jim Sturgess is quite a charming devil swell.The story that takes place in One Day is at moments the anti love story and other times a sweeping epic romance, even though this movie has been adapted from a book it's still a lot more original than other romantic themed films of late. Lone Scherfig definitely suits this style of English romance, starting with An Education and now this, it may sound mean but I just don't think the romantic dramas that come from the U.S have the same genuine feel that the English films do.I had read the book and i have to say that this is a very loyal adaptation, much of the beauty from the book is clear and present here, particularly the friendship aspect between Dex and Emma, in the book it's a quirky kind of friendship and it transferred well on the screen as, I was very pleased that the film makers didn't ruin that with a cheap silly sexual type of friendship.I could say a lot about how lovely this movie is but I think I'll let everyone make up their own mind.

63,Tactrix,On The Fence,8,4 January 2012,"This is a movie about Emma(Annie Hathaway) and Dexter(Jim Sturess). The basic premises of the movie that girl meets boy at university, girl has a crush on boy, they both suffer from atrocious timing, eventually through a series of many years end up together, and throughout the entire movie you see 1 day in the years to pass.Now from watching this movie I can tell you a couple things. First, this movie is 75% depression 25% happiness, that is to say that, it has some very good moments, but they are far and few between, in the meantime you are watching a dread that we call Dexter's life, with Annie popping in every once in a while to cheer him up. If you ever want to see a story about love that makes you happy watch something else, because about 3/4 of the way through the movie you seriously consider whether there should be a warning for suicidal people, had I gone through what these people had I might have hung myself. The acting by both the main actors is very good and dead on point. The trouble is since you only get to see bursts of this one day over and over again, in different years it makes Dexter appear as a male slut and Annie appear like a misguided virgin, even thought she isn't and he clearly is. All and all I recommend watching something else, this movie is a gross misrepresentation of what a love story should be. Yes we can't a happy ending everywhere but, in this movie there really needed to be one, to make the story work and balance out, and there just wasn't, a terrible disappointment.",One Day
64,chaz-28,"One Day, Two Lead Actors, Three Strikes for that Accent",3,24 August 2011,"There is a lingering and persistent distraction throughout One Day which severely impairs the audience from becoming absorbed in the film. This is Anne Hathaway's atrocious accent. Many Americans have at varying degrees in the past successfully pulled off a believable British accent. However, Anne Hathaway's character, Emma Morley, sounds at different times Irish, Scottish, and American, but never British. It truly was irritating after awhile. Why didn't the filmmakers just cast a British actress? Or, if they were dead set on Hathaway playing Emma, then move the whole story to America. If not for the distracting aural miscues, this film would most likely be much more enjoyable.Emma and Dexter (Jim Sturgess) meet the night of college graduation at the tail end of an all night party. This is not a meet-cute either. They are the only two left as the last couple pairs off with each other; therefore, fate has thrown them together to have a one night stand. Things get in the way and they end up deciding to be friends and start a very long platonic relationship. This is mostly convincing as Emma is seen to be truly infatuated with Dexter who does not see her in the same light, in fact, he treats her rather poorly as the years go by. Graduation night was July 15th by the way so naturally the pair concocts a plan to meet up annually on that day or at least check in my telephone if this is not possible.Surprisingly, every July 15th is actually a pretty horrible, sad day for each of them. Very rarely is one or both of them in a good mood and happy with where their life is at when the film jumps forward to another July 15th. Furthermore, the film focuses much more on Dexter than Emma with extensive scenes concerning his alcoholism and career missteps. Emma even authors a successful book and it hardly gets a mention until Dexter happens upon it. This made me wonder that if Dexter was to have so much more attention and screen time than Emma, why all the fuss to make Anne Hathaway British? Since the screenplay was written by the same gentlemen who wrote the novel this film is based on, the story's climax is inevitable even though it is forced and manipulative. The scene is also very poorly shot. The director, Lone Scherfig, who made the brilliant An Education two years ago, completely misses the mark with this scene and the rest of the film suffers for it. The event is set up in a way that even people who venture out and see one movie a year will be able to see what is coming up.Another miscue is Patricia Clarkson's role as Dexter's mother. It feels her role has been severely cut during the editing process. Not only does she have dialogue in the preview which is not in the movie, but she only shows up in about two-three scenes, moves the plot along, and then she's out of there. I have not read the novel, but I guarantee she is a much larger presence on those pages than what seems to be a faint echo of her in this movie.P.S. There is an atrocious Elvis Costello song over the closing credits which destroys any lingering fondness or afterthoughts the audience may have been enjoying during the closing scenes.",One Day

Emma (played by Anne Hathaway with an absentee accent that comes and goes with no real mention) is an aspiring writer from a humble background. Dexter (played by Jim Sturgess of 21 and Across the Universe) is the son of wealthy parents with whom he has a difficult relationship.Through many years we see Dexter (Sturgess) go from a television personality who's despised even by his fans to a man with no career who takes a job at a restaurant in the hopes of moving up the ladder in the organization to make a living for his wife and child. Meanwhile Emma (Hathaway) spends most of that time working in a Mexican restaurant and involved with a man she doesn't love but who loves her dearly. And for a large portion of that time in her life, she and Dexter are not speaking despite being each other's best friends.While Sturgess is believable enough as the uber-cad who gets by on charm until that gives way substance abuse and boorishness and Hathaway is fine save for her accent, the story isn't very interesting and the ending left me annoyed and confused and maybe more than a little aggravated.

I think this film suffered from the difficulty of transferring to the screen a story based upon following 2 characters through an annual snapshot of their lives - for me, the story was too sketchy and lacked enough depth for each stage of their lives. I think we missed some important background and substance for the events, although the relationship between Dexter and Emma made sense. When they got together properly, this was a climax of the book and yet it didn't feel that way in the film, it was't given enough weight. The tragedy also was shown as written in the book, but the consequences not explored well enough. Having said all that, I did enjoy it, I just feel it could have been better. It wasn't satisfying, although the book was. Anne Hathaway was excellent, and many of the other cast members gave great performances.",One Day
69,shannen-l-c,A heart-wrenching tale of love and life,7,2 January 2019,"I decided to watch 'One Day' with the expectation that it would be a cheesy rom-com with a cliche love story and fairy-tale ending that would leave me feeling uplifted and with a smile on my face. Boy, how wrong was I?'One Day' is anything but your typical Hollywood rom-com, it is a heartbreaking emotional journey that reflects the ups and downs of real life and is relatable to anyone that watches it. Even as I write this review, my eyes are still red and my cheeks tear stained from the amount of crying I did watching this film - it's truly an emotional journey!The premise of 'One Day' as being a story of two young lovers and friends that meet up once a year throughout the years is simplistic and does not reflect the emotional depth that is present in this story. It is so much darker than I anticipated I would be and instead of being ""fluffy"" and feel-good, it was at times very dark and intense (particularly as it progresses). It shares similarities with 'Love, Rosie' in its portrayal of the love stories, but is a more authentic and realistic love story. In my opinion, what 'One Day' does that 'Love, Rosie' and no other film I have ever watched has done so well is be truthful to the realities of life. There are no cliches, no shortcuts, no unnecessary melodrama or theatrics, no easy or simple route to happiness, no happy endings. It is faithful to the harshness and difficulties that all of us endure throughout our lives. It demonstrates the transition from the hopeful young graduate who believe their world is at their feet, to adult where they are struggling to find their way and grieving the happy future they believed they would have when they were young, naive and optimistic. In addition, it demonstrates the complexities of love and friendship, and how time, distance and separation can place strain upon those relationships but also how they can endure.Emma (Anne Hathaway) and Dexter (Jim Sturgess) have a beautiful friendship that is meaningful, authentic and realistic. The performances of both actors are phenomenal and their talent and chemistry makes the relationship completely believable. The connection between the two (Hathaway and Sturgess as actors and Emma and Dexter as characters) means that it's so easy to become emotionally invested in their story. Their relationship is far from simple and despite the pair being obviously in love from early on in their friendship, the complications of life and the barriers that prevent them being from together are so palpable that it almost feels one could be watching a real-life couple. In my opinion, few fictional on-screen couples have reflected what real friendships and love look like as much as Emma and Dexter.Admittedly, the pacing at times felt slow and in the latter half of the focus seemed to shift majorly towards Dexter (but that makes sense as the story continues), I found myself wandering WHAT the film was trying to do, but I simultaneously couldn't take my eyes from the screen. I was so invested in Emma and Dexter as characters and their relationship, that I couldn't do anything but see it to the end. And boy, nothing can quite prepare you for the ending. There's no happy ending to be found here, but it leaves a mark and I always believe that to be a sign of a truly good film. The disappointments, frustrations, 'what ifs', regrets, lost hopes and dreams are all what make this film so heartbreaking and is why I expect most that watch it to come away with a tissue in their hand and tears streaming down their face.Some may criticise this film for being too boring or too depressing, but those that do, are in my opinion, completely failing to understand or appreciate what 'One Day' accomplishes. Although it is a story about love, it is anything but romanticised and unlike most romantic films out there, it doesn't create unrealistic or false perceptions of relationships - it is a story about REAL people, REAL life and REAL love and that authenticity is what sets 'One Day' apart from others in its genre.",One Day

75,Reel_starz,A pleasant yet unmemorable love story,7,30 August 2011,"Whenever I hear that one of my favorite books is being adapted into a movie, I feel a mixture of excitement and trepidation; lately, trepidation has generally come out on top. After several years of disappointing results, from the Notebook-esque sapfest that was The Time Traveler's Wife to London Boulevard, which didn't even received a U.S. release date, it was difficult to muster much optimism for Lone Scherfig's interpretation of One Day. Playing like a British mash-up of When Harry Met Sally and (500) Days of Summer, David Nicholls's 2009 bestseller is far from a traditional Hollywood romance, with its quirky structure and emphasis on authenticity and melodrama. I entered the theater prepared for a letdown, refusing to let the promising cast and shrewd directorial choice get my hopes up. Yet at the halfway mark, I came to a surprising realization: I actually kind of liked it. Naturally, it doesn't come close to the excellent source material, but I can say as much: at no point did I wish it had never been made. Although that may sound like faint praise, considering my recent track record for book adaptations, it's more than adequate.My greatest fear concerning One Day was that it would be more of an adaptation than a real movie, a carbon copy of the book that never finds a life of its own. Luckily, the film-makers mostly dodged this bullet; in fact, I think the movie might work better for those unfamiliar with the source material, who can watch without preconceived expectations. The majority of the credit must be given to the two young leads. Despite the shallow script, which never quite reaches the emotional depth of the novel, Anne Hathaway and Jim Sturgess share a subtle, effortless chemistry that lends the film an unexpected sincerity, making it easy for the audience to root for them. They are not likely to top any lists for ""Best Cinematic Couple"", but through fleeting glances and offhand kisses, they effectively convey the quiet yearning that defines their characters' relationship, which, even in the book, is more playful than romantic. They are also admirable by themselves. Sturgess is perfect as the spontaneous, arrogant Dexter, injecting just the right amount of angst and self-loathing beneath his character's haughty exterior. Dubious accent aside, Anne Hathaway fits nicely into the role of Emma Morley, the ego to Dexter's id. She finds a comfortable balance between compassion and pragmatism, and her rational demeanor and down-to-earth attractiveness make her a relatable heroine. The supporting cast is solid, albeit unremarkable; Sturgess and Hathaway are undeniably the stars.Theoretically, director Lone Scherfig should be right in her comfort zone here. Her breakout hit, An Education, which jumpstarted the career of Carey Mulligan and snagged an Oscar nomination for Best Picture, displayed the flawless combination of wit and heart required by One Day, and her smart handling of the romance between Mulligan's naïve 16 year old schoolgirl and Peter Sarsgaard's slick thirty-something con artist suggested a knack for unconventional relationships. For the most part, One Day does nothing to mar her budding reputation, but it lacks the polished finesse of An Education. The pacing is uneven, as she appears to be more concerned with keeping the running time under two hours than letting viewers soak in her world and its inhabitants, and the shift between years feels rather arbitrary and indistinct. If it weren't for the white letters appearing at the beginning of each scene, it would be impossible to gauge the passage of time. The framing device, which worked brilliantly in the book, feels more gimmicky than innovative.That is, ultimately, the movie's biggest flaw. Sure, it's a sweet romance, but what made the novel so special, what elevated it above the typical will-they-won't-they formula, was its honesty. Through the voices of Emma and Dexter, Nicholls captured the mood of a generation struggling to meet the expectations of a society that insists on fueling dreams of fame, fortune and happiness, only to shatter them. One Day is more than a simple love story; it's a study of two individuals and their attempts to deal with setbacks, disappointments and hardships, to find meaning in their seemingly haphazard lives. Sharp yet never cynical, nostalgic yet never sentimental, it is remarkable not for its witty dialogue or its unconventional narrative but for its keen eye for the rhythms of conversation, the fragile barrier between thought and spoken word and the tendency of people to act without logic. It is astoundingly, heartbreakingly human. From the outset, it's evident that the movie will not replicate this feat. The scene in which Dexter and Emma first meet feels too rushed and matter-of-fact for the audience to sense the bond that develops between them, a shortcoming magnified by the fact that Scherfig all but eliminates the the first chapter of the book, constricting several pages of prose into approximately five minutes. While the actors show enough personality to win sympathy for the protagonists, the movie never lets you really get to know them. They're only a shade of the vivid, nuanced people described in the book. To be fair, part of the blame lies with Nicholls himself since he wrote the screenplay, though the truth is, a story as complex and understated as One Day simply doesn't translate onto the big screen, where the visuals are everything and subtlety can easily be lost. Even the shock ending feels more bewildering than tragic. It's a shame really, but sometimes, good enough has to be, well, good enough.",One Day
76,jmc4769,Few redeeming qualities,1,19 August 2011,"I just got back home from seeing this movie, and I feel like I've been hit upside the head with a baseball bat. I'm a sucker for romantic movies, and I've sat through hundreds of mediocre ones that were watchable anyway. But One Day had to be one of the worst romance movies I have ever had the misfortune to endure. It was especially disappointing because I've loved Anne Hathaway in just about everything she's been in (Princess Diaries, Ella Enchanted, Rachel Getting Married, The Devil Wears Prada, Rio, etc.). One Day has few redeeming qualities, except for the occasional pretty scenery. The most serious problem is Jim Sturgess's character, Dexter. Dexter is an unlikable, shallow womanizer. I know what you're thinking: Charming womanizers are a staple of these movies. But Sturgess gives Dexter no charm, no glimmer of humanity, no hint that there may be lovable qualities beneath his contemptible persona. The usually wonderful Hathaway (Emma) gets mired down here in a bad script. And there is not the tiniest spark of chemistry between the two. I kept thinking, ""Come on, Emma, block this loser's number and take out a restraining order."" When the inevitable romance comes, it hasn't a shred of believability. This movie ultimately amounts to a plain Jane wish-fulfillment fantasy (yep, Hathaway is supposed to be plain)...sort of like those movies where the nerdy guy gets the hot girl. The plot structure is a big problem too. We see the main characters only on one day (July 15th) of every year from 1988 to 2011. Instead of continuity, character development, and relationship development, we get mostly uninteresting snippets of their lives. The final straw for me though was the surprise ending, which was a completely gratuitous attempt to insert meaningful drama into an otherwise vacuous movie. At this point, I was begging for the movie to be over, but no such luck. Incredibly, screenwriter (and author of the book of the same name), David Nicholls, drags this bad movie out for another 15 minutes or so.",One Day

A lot of people who read the book complained about the movie. When will people realize that a movie is an adaptation of a book...NOT THE BOOK. A film is like a Reader's Digest or summary of a book. No film can possible remain faithful to the novel. That's one reason I never read a book that has been made into a film. As for the story, I found it interesting and liked the sequence of events, including the flash back at the end. Innovative to say the least. And yes, ANNE HATHAWAY was quite wonderful. She hasn't given a bad performance yet and I doubt ever will. In this film she had a Judy Garland type look at times. She would be a wonderful Judy if a film is ever made of her life. So see this movie and enjoy it for what it is. Be thankful that there are no special effects, explosions, foul language etc. It is also rare nowadays to hear a nice them song in the background.

They almost have a one night stand, but when it does not happen, they then decide to be friends. We are then shown glimpses of their lives through the years.Throughout the film i waited and waited to feel a connection, but it never came, perhaps a little near the end, but it was too late. It might have been the writer or directors fault because i felt the actors were there, except at times Hathaway's accent was not quite on spot. Maybe it jumped through the years a bit too much to allow the viewer a chance to completely give themselves over to the story.It's a chick-flick, but lacking in emotional depth to move the heart to fall in love, so i say it is not worth the time, unless you have nothing else to watch.",One Day

Dexter's wealthy life seems to be spoiling him and Em, in her effort to achieve her goals, goes through many ups and downs.

The music that escorts the movie is quite good and takes you back in time, with artists like Tears for Fears, Primal Scream, Robbie Williams, Fatboy Slim, Tricky and Elvis Costello.It's a nice romantic drama with not many major twists and turns, other than those needed to get to the point.",One Day
88,fshardlow,NO,4,19 December 2018,"After seeing the 1h 40 min runtime I knew this film was not going to be a favourite of mine. Ten minuets in, I was not wrong.David Nicholls's 'One Day' is in my opinion, a really gorgeous book that made me think introspectively about my own life. I loved it. It felt like it had magnitude, ambition and a really warm story that I just fell in to.
This film has severely irritated me.Firstly... the positives:
Hathaway was perfect, reading the book, she was exactly the kind of woman that came to mind for what I perceived Emma to be like, good job casting directors.
The guy who played Ian was also brilliant, bringing a whole new life and lovability to the character that I didn't think was there in the book. Nice.Right, now what I didn't like...
DEXTER. I thoroughly do not think Jim Sturgess was a good casting choice AT ALL. Is it just me? I just did not find one interesting or redeemable thing about this movie's interpretation of Dexter. In the book, yes he was an idiot, but I still found him interesting and routed for him. I just found him overbearing in the film. His ageing process was really not very believable either... So 1/2 of the main cast I hate, not great...
Also, I just don't think the format of the book could work on screen, especially with such a short run time. It felt really REALLY rushed. There was no time to really attach onto any character at any moment, it all felt a bit of a wash.
ALSO... I absolutely HATED those year by year banners that came up and then magically whooshed away every 5 minutes, talk about subtle!Overall, this film was just a right old let down. Some decent humour in places, good casting of Emma but even with Hathaway's brilliant portrayal, I just didn't get enough time to care about her in this film.
I'm sure lots of effort went into it so i don't want to discredit the director etc but I'm afraid that this film was a complete miss for me.
Just put some extra effort in and read the book...well you probably don't want to now, you know what happens in the end......Well that's me done. Bye.",One Day

90,FSfilmblog,A faithful adaptation but some elements are lost in translation,7,28 January 2012,"Whenever there's a successful book, an adaptation of the story is never far away. Here we have a faithful adaptation from it's own author (David Nicholls is the writer for the film so no one can argue about what is put on screen). The story, for those of you who haven't read the book, follows the lives of two people, Dexter Mayhew (Jim Stugress) and Emma Morley (Anne Hathaway). What differs from the norm, is the fact we only meet Dexter and Emma on this ""one day"" July 15th (St Swithin's Day) every year, for twenty years starting on the night of their graduation. We are shown how their relationship develops over time, from going on holiday together to family bereavement to fall outs and reunions. Sometimes they are together and at other times they are not. Throughout the years they start to grow apart, their lives moving in different directions but their initial connection inevitably always draws them back together. They both experience failed relationships and eventually realise their true feelings for one another and they end up together as fate would have them to be.I'm sure that many fans of the book would cry outrage at the numerous missing sub plots and minor details but the main emotional ethos of the source material remains intact. There is only so much you can expect to fit into an hour and forty feature film. Full praise goes to Rafe Spall as the one time long suffering ex boyfriend of Emma as he steals every scene he is in. The character is bought to life in a better way than I could have ever imagined. The two leads do command the screen well as they go through a range of emotions with events which affect their lives. An obvious talking point will be Hathaways accent. I'm not going to say it's bad but it does veer in and out of Yorkshire tones. Her Englishness isn't at all terrible but some words do stick out like a sore thumb. It's not a complete mess and does not ruin what is pretty much a very commendable performance.The use of music to mark the progression of the years is very efficient in allowing viewers to hear as well as see the date on screen via text appearing in an inventive and nifty way. Apart from allowing the actors hair to grow/shorten or go grey, there isn't much the film makers could do to show two people growing older through to their late 30's early 40's.In some ways the film works as well as the book. The unnecessary flab in the book is trimmed and so are some of the characters which doesn't effect the overall journey of two lead characters. What is lacking I found is the lack of emotional depth that you could get from the book that you couldn't get from the film. The thoughts and feelings can only be portrayed by the two stars but the thoughts are not heard like they are in text. The emotional wallop doesn't translate fully but there are still snatches of tears to be found in the saddest parts of the film.For the fans of the book, I would have to say not to go in expecting everything you may have read in the novel and you won't be disappointed. The films stays close to the books heart and the journey of Emma and Dexter is brought to life in a worthy adaptation. For those of you who haven't read the book, go out and read it.",One Day

Early on in the film Emma is kind of mousy but nice whereas Dexter is kind of smarmy but with charm. Dexter's life is almost immediately successful after graduation whereas Emma struggles, and doesn't achieve her career goals right away. Both characters develop out of their more negative personality traits as the film progresses.Both leads are pretty good with the material given to them. Anne Hathaway's accent isn't brilliant as other reviewers have mentioned, but it wasn't too distracting for me. Jim Sturgess' accent goes all over the place too and he is British! I'm guessing he's supposed to posses a posh Anglo-Scots accent.. The ageing process through makeup/hair etc. works mostly although I did find Jim Sturgess' ginger beard and grey hair aged about 45 a bit distracting and very unnatural looking - not a good job by the hair and makeup artists there!Anyway, the film looks really good, very well shot with a use of colours to convey the mood and emotion of Emma and Dexter at that particular time in their lives. Other characters come in and out of Dexter and Emma's lives throughout which adds some depth to the story. I found myself rooting for the leads mostly, and although I've not read the book I had kind of worked out what would happen by the end but when it comes it is a bit of a shock. The grief and sadness after this are very well portrayed I think. Overall I enjoyed One Day.

There are some amusing moments, and the premise of the film is very interesting - watching two 'best friends' progress through 20 years by catching up with them every 15th July.
I definitely think that a change of cast and a slight script change would have improved this movie immensely.
Hathaway is good, but drops in and out of an unconvincing Northern accent to the point that she's sometimes incomprehensible.
The male lead was completely miscast. A younger Hugh Grant would have been perfect, and when you've had Hugh Grant you can't settle for a vastly poorer version. I've never really seen this guy before- and haven't seen him since- so that tells you something.
He's just not a great actor, and fails to pull off the hapless posh boy who messes up every relationship he gets into role that Grant does immaculately.
As for Hathaways boyfriend, again another miscast. She's clearly an exceptionally beautiful woman yet she's landed this geeky unfunny unlikable character as a partner - I'm sorry, he didn't work for me either and another actor would have nailed that role.
I think this movie was a missed opportunity for something better - it's a great idea, I loved the concept and it's definitely still worth seeing for that aspect alone.
Hopefully the idea may be picked up again in the future with a director and cast which had the vision to make this the fantastic character study it deserves to be.",One Day

Both really endearing characters, right? Now, lets take one day out of each year and look in on them. They call each other sometimes. Sometimes they just go to work. What we never see is why these two would even care about each other. The woman lives with another guy at one point in the film with as much enthusiasm as if she were picking up her laundry. Why are they even together? The only way to get through this movie is with the finger poised closely to the speed search button on your DVD player for those (many) moments of emptiness. There isn't a true emotional moment in this movie. And as for the ending, it's telegraphed within the first few minutes of this film. Cliché riddled from start to finish. Believe me, you won't feel a thing.",One Day

It really is the most depressing waste of 2 hours I have ever endured.The leading lady is knocked down by a truck and killed, and the leading man ends the film a washed up drunk, divorced, single parent widower. Oh, and his mum dies of cancer two thirds of the way through.One feels absolutely no affinity with nor sympathy for either lead character, and Anne Hathaway's English accent is worse than Dick van Dyke's.

97,thiagosblancos,It might have been...,4,11 March 2020,"Let's start by saying that I loved the book, I read it before the movie was screened so of course I know, well before I even went to the cinema to watch this, that it was not going to be as good. That said, boy, what a lost chance to make a great film this was.First, if you wanted a British actress, Anne Hathaway is not your girl, hey, don't get me wrong here, she *is* a good actress and I love her but she cannot make a Brit accent for the life of hers, she just can't. And on top of that, she has proven that before in ""Becoming Jane"" so why did they chose her to begin with!?Then, Emma is a bit chubby and AH looks like she has never had an extra pound in her life. Kudos btw!It's a pity that this is what they delivered out of a superb book, it has all, and it is a 9/9.5 when the movie can mostly get a 5/10. Even more, this film does not do any credit to the story. And it's not the actors' fault, at all.I do hope someone, someday, will give it a go again. But I doubt this could be portrayed in a good way in a movie, it is too long to be shortened this much without destroying its ethos, same happened in ""The Goldfinch"", a miniseries might have worked better and would have given time to the story to be developed, and that is exactly what the writers didn't have unless they chose to make a 5 hours' movie.Now, all the bad reviews concerning the end and all, people, grow up, or get a shrink, it's up to you, life s*cks on a daily basis, and these things do happen. Whenever you feel you have everything... well, you got something wrong but you were happy, perhaps you didn't notice at some point but you actually were, that's the message, they had that, they had each other and they found one another. If you didn't get that, well, get help. Really, for life is as far removed as possible from ""Legally Blonde"" at this point.And I promise, it will get worse.",One Day
98,KristenM90,Frivolous,4,21 September 2011,"I walked into this movie with low expectations, due to what reviews I had heard, and I walked out neither impressed or disappointed. The acting was alright, the design was interesting, but the storyline was flat and the characterization was two dimensional. I found myself looking at the clock about halfway through, which is never a good sign when I go to see a film.Anne Hathaway plays a British girl, which confused me as to why this role hadn't been given to an actual British actress. Her accent was alright; it slid between satisfactory and disappointing throughout the film. She wasn't given much to work with, however she didn't put much into it anyway. The role of Emma was two-dimensional, weak and frankly a little masochistic.Jim Sturgess in his role as Dexter was also weak. His character, a playboy who just wants to be loved, seemed too familiar and too paint by numbers. He just keeps spiralling out of control, and it seems like (beyond losing his job due to him getting older) he doesn't suffer any consequences. He gets married, he has a kid, and even after that falls through he still gets Emma in the end. Did anyone else want to see this guy be the one to get hit by the bus? The episodic day-by-day structure, while not all that original, was still pleasantly structured, with the dates displayed in different ways. However, the passing of time seemed erratic, with little or no real transition. Sometimes, years would be shown with a two second clip of someone swimming, or something equally confusing in regards to its relevancy to the storyline.The ending was particularly upsetting for me. Emma is killed, all for a pure shock reaction from the audience. Truly, her death was just meant to invoke a emotional reaction, and the death serves no purpose, leaving the final minutes of the film with a strange feeling of misguided sadness (not to mention a whole bunch of false endings).This movie needs a major overhaul. What with inane dialogue, confusing plot points, and unnecessary characters (Ian the boyfriend comes to mind), I found it difficult to like this movie. There are some good points (the design, the score, and some of the comic relief), but they are all foreshadowed by the bad.",One Day

This was a fine rom-semi-com, a terrific younger'ish and more modernist remake-update of 1978's classic ""Same Time Next Year"" (Alan Alda and Ellen Burstyn) and may be Anne Hathaway's best & most balanced performance yet. If anything, the film almost tackles too much with the Ramola Garai (looking great & possibly under-used) sub-theme; yet, ultimately, it's integral. Great twist toward the end that has the right amount of surprise element. And it is a perceptive commentary used for dramatic effect on Life as this Reviewer's known it.

This movie doesn't really strike any new ground or do anything unexpected, but I enjoyed it quite a bit.Anne Hathaway is wonderful of course (but to be honest, her accent is a bit lacking. Mostly it's passable but it definitely could have been better), and I thought that she had really great chemistry with Jim Sturgess. The writing is good and the movie's pacing was pretty solid as well - there a few parts that I felt could have been extended a little bit, but that's straying into spoiler territory.My only real issue is that I didn't feel like they did quite enough to make Jim Sturgess' character as likable as he could be earlier in the movie. He definitely gets character development throughout the middle and end, but at the beginning it's still a little strange that Anne Hathaway's character would want to be that close of a friend with him.Overall though I enjoyed the movie a lot and it's definitely one that I'd watch again.

101,marcusdestorm,Best Romantic Drama of 2011,10,28 November 2011,"When two University Graduates finally recognise one another there are little questions and answers given and taken, before they are frolicking around inside the girl's room. It is when Emma (Anne Hathaway) reveals her inexperience of relationships that the rich, playboy student starts to subdue himself in his eagerness of the girls company. For Dexter (Jim Sturgess), who has been so used to women in their volley's falling at his feet, Emma is altogether different and in many ways aware of his sexual magnetism towards the female community.Starting out like a Mills & Boon Romance novel - but without the raw sex lustre – ""One Day"" Anker's itself on one date ""15th July"" which, to those that are unfamiliar with British Holidays, it is St. Swithins Day. And this is the day that Emma and Dexter bond together as the very best of friends. Chronicling more than ten years of the two friends bond, the film shows in-depth insights and tribulations that true friends go through in their lives. The one and only twist in this feature being that Emma Morley (a once famous writer) and Dexter are madly in love and besotted with one another.With Ken Stott (Steven –Dexter's Father) giving a very strong casting, too, it is the inter-mingling of Mother and Father which adds to the powerful storyline which many viewers may find disturbing. The relationship between all three characters for Dexter comes across very well, as does the ""feel sorry"" factor that will leave people speechless, to say the least. For the fact that this film concentrates very well on the characters as well as the retro travel through music and the drastic changes in society stabilities, while throwing in tragedy and ""Real Life"" situations, it is without a doubt one of this years most noted Romantic Dramas.That of ""Bridget Jones"" it is not, nor is it anyway similar, or equal to ""Room in Rome"", it is unique. One Day is very pleasurable to watch, the interweaving music, decadence and personal issues work together, while the final scene of the movie may well have many women (possibly men, too) reaching for their tissues. With a very powerful storyline, strengthened by the selection of cast, it is ""One Day"" that not only deserves a 'High 5' for its entire film crew, but the highest rating possible for its concept and contribution to the British Film Scene.",One Day
102,Jb11174,Hate romantic comedies but this is a MUST see,9,16 February 2014,I've recently seen this movie and I have watched it several times. Sometimes in life we do not go after what we truly want due to outside factors. This is a true love story where timing in life prevented two lovers from seriously taking the daring plunge with one another. Each year they either meet or not and see where their lives progressed or not. There lives were polar opposites but eventually met and they enjoyed a short meant to be love affair until Emma's life is suddenly taken away. You hope and wish each 7/15 they finally admit their love for one another. The movie keeps you on your seat as you wait to see what is happening in Dex & Emma's lives separately or together.

A story about two people and how their relationship develops over the years, as friends, as less than that sometimes and as more than that, too. The characters are believable and much more complex than a lot of films of its ilk.I loved the performances of both Anne Hathaway and Jim Sturgess and connected easily with both their characters. They brought them alive and keep the viewer wrapped up in the complexities of what happens between them.Some have criticised Anne Hathaway for her accent, which I feel is a little unfair. It may not be a definable accent from one particular part of the North of England, but it's never unbelievable and I feel it could be consistent with someone who's grown up in one region and lived elsewhere during other parts of their life.

I'm just too shocked - in a good way - with surprise. Let's start with that I have never given 10 so far, even for my favorite movies. This of course doesn't mean that this movie is perfect, just means that let's sh*t on all the little insignificant ""this could be done differently"" details. This movie is like our best friend: love it with its faults - or especially for those. I loved the fact that throughout the movie we had the time traveling through the greatest hits....it made me smile all the time. I was wondering if this story would have been more attractive with more attractive main actors: but NO: this couple made the story believable, and although Mr. Dexter won't keep me sleepless during the night, he is a real flesh and blood man, with his troubles. Anne Hatheway is perfect as a British actress - love her accent, and humor, suits her. I love that it never got corny: this love story could happen TO US: as it DOES HAPPEN to us. At least it happened to me.....so I saw myself in them. I have to admit I got upset when Emma died. It was a little bit banal, but as it made me cry - and that weeping went till the end... - so I felt that the impact it had on me was a sign for the right choice of this kind of ending. I mean it had to end somehow - and we cannot see them going to IKEA, or going to get a little Chinese girl.....so in a way it was okay. I could feel their love. Because it was human, and so full of little imperfections, nothing too dramatic but at the same time beautiful. Also it was a great match to put Paris and London as the two settings - my two favorite cities. On the whole this movie was a huge surprise for me (have to admit I didn't want to go to the movies back then...thought this would be just another love story, how wrong I was!). It not only made my heart go fonder, but also made me laugh many times, and now I will go to sleep with those images and feelings in my mind. I WANT ROMANTIC MOVIES LIKE THIS!!! PLEASE!!!",One Day
116,rcoss2001,We Sacrificed Our Time For You - Semi Spoilers,3,31 August 2011,"Betsy has said in the past that the best part of a movie is often the anticipation of seeing it. I'll added this one to that list. My wife and I went expecting a romantic comedy.Our mistake,this is a romantic drama. Could be called a romantic tragedy I suppose. We had neither one read the novel, but I'd won the tickets and we like Anne Hathaway. We'd seen Jim Sturgess in Across The Universe and The Other Boylen Girl, but didn't remember him from those.Hathaway plays Emma, Sturgess plays Dexter. Both are young students who have just graduated on 15 July 88 when the film starts. Well, no it starts on 15 July 2006 (or 07) and then flashes way back to 88. The gimmick in this movie is that the two main characters meet,seem to like each other a lot - and decide to become just good friends. This after a scene between them on their first night together that to me, as a male, having been in my 20's once long ago, could not find believable. We then get to see them interact once a year on the same day, 15 July. Sometimes things go well, sometimes there are serious arguments but they stay FRIENDS even though it's obvious to everyone around them that they are more than that, or should be. The movie Same Time, Next Year the wonderful 1978 movie does the same gimmick in a much better way.The movie starts slow, Betsy said she'd have changed the channel if she was watching it on TV. You slowly begin to really dislike Dexter, and wonder what's wrong with Emma. Then you do get into the movie and you're thinking okay, this is finally working and BAM! I won't give that away, though I'm tempted. And then the movie devolves in a most confusing, perplexing ending. Left me muttering WTF to myself over and over. This movie joins the ranks of several old 1940-50's romantic dramas like An Affair To Remember or Random HarvestWhy did a movie with very good acting, set in romantic locations with beautiful photography go wrong for us? Soap opera logic. No one tells the truth when it counts or acts in ways consistent with real behavior.So don't bother with this movie-if you really want the sense of having seen this movie, but much cheaper, go rent a copy of Same Time, Next Year, get a brick or a very heavy book and keep it near you as you watch. Then at about twenty minutes before the end pick up the brick and hit yourself hard in the forehead. Just enough to give you a good concussion so the last of the film doesn't make sense to you.

And it is a very fine adaptation of famed author David Nicholls without many deviations so the movie is true to the novel. That's kind of nice! The story is weaved around Dexter and Emma who are central to the plot and the goings on keep you engrossed and hooked and pinned to the plot!The movie opens in the period of late 80s, from the college days of Emma & Dexter (Hathaway & Sturgess) and follows them for 2 decades and keeps you engrossed to one day which is 15th of July every year, year on year between these two characters. It goes through many metamorphoses right from the late 80s youthful, exuberant and rebellious life days to mellowed, matured and heading towards middle age days, It meanders through racy, charming days of youth and moves on to observant and relaxed days of maturity with consummate ease, deftly holding you to thrall without your knowledge! Anne manages to steal the show and be ahead of race the when compared to Sturgess in emoting and breathing life to her character with composure while Sturgess pulls off his Hugh Grantish role with ease too! Will they both finally unite together after nearly 2 decades and after their other relationships that keep going on - on the side is what the climax heads to.

The first major flow is that there's not enough chemistry between the characters, making us care less for them being together or not. The story between Emma and the standup comedian is totally ridiculous.
I feel the movie should have indulged more with the trends, fads, technologies of each era, instead it barely does so. It should have had a more realistic script, where maybe life brings them apart, but although they genuinely fall in love with other people they know nothing will be like them (think of Blue is the warmest color).
The ending is just an easy way to end the movie making us cry a river instead of analyzing more serious issues. It has been done many times before. Instead, it would have been nicer to see they get driven apart because she's barren or he's infertile and maybe get over it after adopting a child, or get torn apart after all these years.

(Even though a French accent is easier to fake than an English one - right, Anne? Which is doubly ironic here when you know that the original ''Anne Hathaway'' was actually Shakespeare's wife!) Granted, many were the critics that actually said that her Yorkshire accent in this one was inconsistent at best; but those are just technicalities, I say!Her co-star is a genuine Brit: Jim Sturgess. He becomes increasingly credible in his role as the movie progresses: but that is due, alas, to the fact that he is a most unlikable character throughout three-quarters of this. Not his fault: it's the way he was written! David Nicholls adapted his own novel that spanned decades in the lives of its two central characters, two characters who love each other but aren't sure they do, most of that time... They do wind up married at one point - but there is no happy ending here. Enough said about that. Nicholls digs out many cultural hallmarks in the movie that he could barely use to full effect in the novel: one character handles a copy of the Watchmen trade paperback, specific songs play throughout the film, pinpointing to greater effect each new era evoked. The one thing perhaps deplorable in all this: the character's names seem to be evoking TV icons of two very different eras: two that don't belong together at all! Hathaway's Emma (Peel - of the Avengers: hey, she was Catwoman too, afterwards, so why not tackle that part as well, indeed?) and Sturgess' Dexter (he might have been less obnoxious here if he had been a serial killer too!) - they might be Nicholls' favorite TV memories, distant and recent, but why bring them together in this totally different setting? But I know, David: as an author, sometimes the most difficult thing is not ''finding the suitable ending'' but quite simply christening your main characters appropriately...! I sympathize!Of note is the cameo here by one Matt Berry (The Third!) of either I.T. Crowd fame or London Dungeon renown - your pick! Matt is always amusing everywhere he appears and, here, as the bearer of bad news for Jim's character (again, I prefer Jim to Dexter) he transforms what would have been an uneventful scene into something much more than that... Great job, Matt; true to form.One Day met with stiff reviews and so-so performances in box-offices worldwide: it was not a complete flop, but it was far from being the success it could, perhaps should have been. It is a touching tale of unrequited or, more precisely, uneven love: basically, she loves more than he does. Time passes. He realizes his (many) errors: and there is still time for them, however... Watch it and make abstraction of all the annoyances (fake accents, odd choices for time capsules, obnoxious male lead) - and you will appreciate this overall effort, essentially due to the original tale, which comes from the novel's main plot. Schefig is a great director, too. Her director of photography here, Delhomme, made both London and Paris look better than they have looked, lately... And the music by Rachel Portman eclipses anything Hans Zimmer has ever done or will ever do - no, really!",One Day

Ironically I just realized that I listed my 'location' as 'reality'. Huh. But that's actually the reason why I don't think this movie is anything better than a 6.5 . I love the initial story, that two people are mad for each other but don't understand/realize/act on it. But I hate how it ends. Probably, because I also believe that there is only one person out there for everyone, and if you have so many feelings, and so many romantic-feelings-related encounters or situations with only one person, then yes, that's the one and yes, it should all work out. So I guess what I'm saying is that it shouldn't be this hard and it maybe actually isn't in real life.

132,robertoneill1509,Don't believe the reviews this film is dire,1,19 September 2012,"Saw this recently having heard so many good reviews,mostly regarding Anne Hathaways accent. From the start this film was ridiculous, Hathaways take on the accent was at best clumsy and Jim Sturgess seemed lost and a little ill at ease playing opposite this superstar actress.Whilst the concept was quirky and original the total unbelievability of the love story made it tedious and boring.There was no chemistry at all between these two, in fact I would go so far as to say Hathaways character had all the traits of a serial stalker. Sturgess' character had no feelings of love for her until the last 20 minutes by which time Id had enough.He was in effect pushed on her by by his own partners affair with his best friend, hardly the love story of the century.The death of Hathaways character was a relief, because for me it summed up the whole film, a complete was of time. There was no point to her death, the film would have been at least salvageable if they had gone on to live happily ever after.To sum up,if you want a good cry, watch it through to the end, I cried for a different reason,it cost me £3.95 through Sky box office.",One Day

Well I decided I was going to watch this. Well for the most part and I'll throw some spoilers in here, but there were three parts of this film I liked.I liked the beginning where Anne Hathaway comes out of the bathroom wearing her graduation gown and cap and not much more. I also liked the part where they cuddled up in bed to go to sleep for the night and then I liked the part where Hathaway grabbed that other mans hand in the restaurant on like there 10 year anniversary or something. Out side of those three small very well acted parts the rest of the movie wasn't that good.For one in real life Dexter and Emma would have long since parted ways. They had no reason to stay friends for 20 years like they did most people in real life would have parted ways and they would have never seen each other again. Let's be honest in real life friendships come and friendships go people change paths change direction etc etc. The whole film I'm sitting there going ""there's no reason for these two Dex and Em to be dragging this friendship out this long. It was painful to watch because you could tell the two characters were really struggling to keep a ""friendship"" alive that well to be honest had no real reason to be kept alive. I guess the acting was okay I just thought the film was a bit slow and the story wasn't really all that romantic.",One Day

136,Intellectual_Mishap,What a lot of scunnery nonsensical crap,1,19 November 2011,"I had a lot of problems with this film; in a nutshell - both main characters were a pair of complete numpties. Anne Hathaway's character was this 21-year old going on 50 year old who did a good impression of a frigid librarian whilst also managing to be very annoying and an absolute scunner. Jim Sturgess (mental note - will avoid all films with him in future) was a right banker, only replace the 'b' with a 'w'. He had this terrible transatlantic, slimy twit of an accent going on, I didn't find him charming or enigmatic, I just thought, you're a right idiot.The film really missed a trick as well with the so called passing of time and context of the era. In the beginning scenes it was set in the 80s, had they not told us this, I would've thought it was 1940 by the way everyone was dressed (costume design?). I also hate the way a lot of these films depict British people, as if we've all got a bag of jorries in our mouth and we're as posh as the queen or something. Totally unrealistic and off the mark totally.The plot is totally predictable, I guessed every major event in it. I felt no empathy towards the characters whatsoever. When Anne Hathaway's character got run over by a bus, that was the highlight for me. I was watching it with my mum, and even she commented that it was a shame that Jim Sturgess didn't get run over as well.Another small highlight was seeing Romola Garai playing Sylvie. It's a shame her character didn't have a larger role, as she's a fantastic actress. 10 times better than that bore Anne Hathaway.In short, don't waste 2 hours of your life watching this utter drivel.

138,jeffallenhammer,"It may be hard to understand just what the two have on each other, but they are characters I'm familiar with. The woman who is way too into a man that's way too into himself.",8,31 August 2011,"Does life imitate art or does art imitate life? I'm one who tends to avoid the discussion entirely by saying ""both."" One Day is the most real (save a few accents) movie I've seen in a long time. It explores time and how it often slips away from us. Our hearts' desires are often decimated by bad timing, and the movie finds a variety of ways to demonstrate this. So in the case of One Day, art imitates life to the fullest, as we can all sympathize (if only a little) to crushed hopes and shattered dreams, though hopefully we eventually find our way.Anne Hathaway stars as insecure working-class woman Emma, who, for one reason or another is drawn to Dexter, (Jim Sturgess) a charming upper middle class man with a great amount of self-confidence. It may be hard to understand just what the two have on each other, but they are characters I'm familiar with. The woman who is way too into a man that's way too into himself, it happens and for the type, Dex is pretty likable. Em and Dex have nothing in common. But their opposite personalities do what a relationship should; make each other better. They are Yin and Yang, complementary opposites.An interesting technique used by One Day, is that we only get to see the events of a single day, July 15, for each of 20 plus years. Some of my peers have taken to calling this a gimmick. In a year where it seems every other film is either a sequel or a remake/reboot, (which critics and public alike have grown tired of) I feel fresh ideas should be applauded, even if it doesn't quite work. For me, however, it worked to perfection. Director Lone Scherfig (An Education) paints the picture of Em and Dex's up and down relationship with great finesse, never having too much happen on the date year to year. The filmmaker fills us in on what has taken place throughout each year, without conversations seeming inorganic. The cinematography is beautiful, especially a scene where our would-be lovers break all their rules by taking a dip at sunset. There's plenty of humor, joy, sadness, regret and a number of other emotions to be felt. I caution viewers that this isn't a romantic comedy, nor does it end like one. One Day is, however, easily one of the most heartfelt films of the year and should be celebrated for its bravery.",One Day
139,i-r-matt,Bland is the first word that comes to mind.,3,6 July 2012,"Having read the novel that this film was adapted from, I am, of course, naturally biased in favour of the original book, written by David Nicholls. There have been book/film collaborations that I have really enjoyed over the past couple of years (We Need to Talk About Kevin, The Help etc). Sadly, One Day is not one of these.First of all, it all seems a little too simple. Despite staying relatively loyal to the plot of the original book (unlike The Time Traveler's Wife, for example), One Day seems to have been directed in a lacklustre way, as if being directed with a hangover. There is very little imaginative input on Lone Scherfig's part, which really disappoints, and many of the main scenes that are incredibly moving in the book, don't translate in such a way on screen at all(except for one of the final scenes, which was very well done). The humour of Emma Morley in particular, is something that is simplified in such a way that it almost sounds condescending rather than witty, which isn't the case in the book. Also, by missing out important parts of Emma's characterisation, the persona of Emma is dumbed down in such a way, that I would be less offended if she were hanging from a tower screeching for Prince Charming.Secondly, the casting is all wrong. And it really is. For starters, Anne Hathaway. One thing that Hathaway does have, is 'the look' of Emma. But that is about as far as the positives stretch. Emma is nowhere near as likable in the film as she is in the book, and her attempt at a Yorkshire accent really is an insult to dialect coaches, the world over (possibly worse than MelGibson in Braveheart, and who would have thought that possible?).Dexter is acted in a stiff and robotic way which lacks sincerity by Jim Sturgess, which creates a character that I have next to no affection for. He comes across as very cheesy and fake, which isn't Dexter's character in the slightest. The chemistry between Hathaway and Sturgess is almost non- existent, and I find myself straining to believe that such a relationship could be possible without an oxygen machine an a severe usage of electric pads. In addition to this, Sylvie, Tilly, Callum and Suki are all so far off the mark in terms of casting that I almost wonder if this were an 'on the day' audition, with people pulled off the street using a novelty hook (""yes, you're a bit tragic and not as attractive as Jim Sturgess; you can be Callum!"")To put it in simple terms (as this film most certainly is), I was incredibly disappointed with it. Nicholls created an intricate and tragically beautiful storyline, that had such potential to be the new favourite among romance lovers 9and skeptics) everywhere. Sadly, this just hasn't happened. In the slightest. If One Day were a cup of tea, it would have been served with bits of tea leaf floating at the top, and of a lukewarm temperature: bearable, but something you would much rather leave where you found it, and leaving you to question if you could have done a better job of it yourself.",One Day

145,linaskk,Review of One Day,5,18 December 2011,"David Nicholls's book One Day was not something impressive or exceptionally good, but for some reason Danish director Lone Scherfig (An Education, 3 Academy nominations) decided to make her own version of it. Scherfig's adaptation for big screen is pretty much direct one, without any plot changes like alternative of ending, new characters etc.One Day starts like all love stories do – a boy meets a girl. Two college graduates: beautiful shy girl, wearing over sized glasses, Emma (Anne Hathaway) and self confident charismatic upper-class boy Dexter (Jim Sturgess). They spend the night of July 15th together and this starts their relationship going. One Day takes time of 20 years where characters live two separate lives – Emma is trying to become a successful writer, Dexter is working for his fame as a TV host – but no matter what happens in their lives, they meet on 15th of July every year.One day was doomed to be ordinary (means boring as hell) romance movie, but showing only one day of the year has made it interesting experience as this became key aspect of whole film. This composition enables us to see growth of couple's relationship over the flow of time. This idea sounds pretty original, however, the most of romance fans must have seen Marc Webb's (500) Days of Summer, which has exactly the same concept, only the time period is shorter, so it have not involved changes of environment. Those environmental changes are probably the strongest aspect of whole movie. Hearing constantly changing nostalgic music themes (from Corona's Rhythm of the Night to Ronan Keating's Life Is A Roller-coaster), seeing advancing cars, technology and fashion in general, make this idea of passing time believable.The main roles are entrusted to always stunning Anne Hathaway and not very well known British actor Jim Sturgess. Hathaway's solid performance is definitely huge input to movie, but Sturgess's character lacks something. His role is to be charismatic, spontaneous TV host, experiencing both, up and downs, of living rich and famous lifestyle, but the actor simply seems to be unnatural in these situations. Supporting actors do not get much attention since One Day is two people story, but Rafe Spall (Emma's husband) and Patricia Clarkson (Dexter's mother) both fits well in their symbolic little roles, making noticeable changes in couple's lives.One Day is terribly mediocre, moody film. It will be hard to find really good or really bad things after you left your seat, simply because it is average to death. Of course, there are promising aspects such as costumes, locations or music, but they are totally killed by shallow plot. Watching one day might appear as cozy way to spend cold autumn's evening for drama loving women, but for their men it can be painful experience.",One Day

The movie base's around 2 people and their twenty years together, shown only through one day, July 15th. I thought the plot was unique and was a very realistic romance. Sometimes it takes people a lot to lose to realize what life is about, and how certain people are truly important to you. The movie was cute, funny, and quite sad at times. I thought Anne Hathaway did an okay job on the accent, to me it was odd at first but after a couple minutes I had gotten used to it. Her acting was great and you can really see her changing as the years progress. Jim Sturgess was great and in my opinion really portrayed Dexter the best as possible, with the arrogance and attitude exactly as I imagined Dexter would have.

The film has a very unique atmosphere, as it is much quirkier than your average romance. Also, without giving away the ending, I can say that it isn't as predictable as one might think. What I really liked about it was the complexity of the different human relationships that we are shown. The relationship between Emma and Dexter is by no means an easy one, nor is it one-sided. Given how different they are, there is a lot of conflict between them, although they do love each other. Similarly, what Dexter and his ex-wife feel for one another is never pure hatred, but there is a lot of understanding between them.

159,bnntormoes,Dreary and unfufilling,4,28 August 2012,"Positives: *Chemistry between the two leads is actually pretty good, and I did appreciate how realistically their relationship was handled, not just the old tired fairy tale romance. *There's sex (although with both parties covering up), so yeah... *The occasional lighthearted moments in it were pretty alright as well.Negatives *Dreary and bland looking film, with the central gimmick being mostly pointless, making it difficult to keep track of which year they're in THIS time, since the actors all look the exact same between years *Jim Sturgess, while not at all a bad actor per se, had an extreme lack of charisma which left his character unlikeable even when he's supposed to be charming, something which Anne Hathaway has absolutely no problem with. *The screenplay starts off mediocre with mostly poor dialogue, but in the films second half, after a major character dies, the movie scrambles to find its footing and comes up with some of the most terrible scenes I've ever seen in a romance movie. Proving that sentiment, when taken too far, can lead to disastrously sappy results.Look, I really wanted to like this movie. I absolutely love Anne Hathaway as an actress, and I will admit she did an admirable job despite the not so great English accent. Unfortunately, the material just isn't there for me.

160,elizdere,Worse than the book,6,20 March 2016,"The book upon which this movie is based was mediocre - easy to read, but nothing special. This movie is even less interesting, partly as a result of the casting choices. There's nothing horrible about it, but it's just not very good. Baby-faced Jim Sturgess was a poor choice for a movie that follows two friends/maybe lovebirds over the course of a decade. He has charm, but lacks gravitas, and the make-up artists could not figure out how to age him appropriately. Anne Hathaway, while always likable, had trouble mastering whatever British accent she was going for. Presumably she was cast because they'd rather have a big name than find an appropriate Brit for the role. Stronger actors could have made a big difference for the lackluster script. However, the biggest issue was the story and the pacing. Scenes kept cutting off before any emotional connection could be made and the overall plot did not seem to be building toward any big moments. Moments that should have been capitalized on were rushed or thrown aside too quickly. It all seemed random and insignificant. The actors didn't seem connected to their roles, which made it hard for viewers to do so. Overall, it was fine, but ultimately unsatisfying.",One Day

BUT you will want to watch a story like this sooner or later, especially if you are a sentimental spirit looking for a sweet and nice love-story with that bitter-sweet flavor that only Paris-set movies have. In that case, you should absolutely go for this film: watch it, love it, cry over it, and then recognize all its flaws, but be too carried away by the story to really care about them.

So what's not to like?This is probably the weakest performance I've seen by Anne Hathaway. Her character fell flat. The accent wasn't believable nor was it stable. And ultimately, I felt absolutely no passion from her for the lead actor's character. It was dull.I had no idea this was based on a novel. I will never read the book even if books are generally better than movies. I don't see how you could improve this story without altering every detail about it. Dexter is a wastrel who is an alcoholic who is selfish. While Emma (Hathaway) may have made him a better person in the end, what did he do for her? Oh yes. He made her happy. Really??? Well, compared to the other 2 men in her life who had as much personality as an old worn-out shoe, I guess he made her happy. But honestly, a halfway decent person with personality could wipe the floor with Dexter. It's insulting to every woman on the planet for Emma to pine away for a wastrel for 20 years who only sees her value when the alternative is to live life alone.I do not recommend watching this travesty of a story.

173,jackcregan,Spot on yet completely wrong,5,12 December 2011,"When David Nicholls wrote One Day he etched two central characters into my imagination forever. Then I learned about the feature production of this masterpiece and couldn't help but smile sadly. Sad because I knew that, like almost all previous attempts, One Day would not be able to be as successful on the silver screen. Fear and loathing in Las Vegas the only example I can think of that bucks this trend. And that had Jonny Depp under the direction (as if he needs any) of Terry Gilliam.Anne Hathaway (Emma) just doesn't quite cut the English mustard. David Nicholls sharpens his screenplay skills as he improves on his decent 'Starter for Ten' debut. Lone Scherfig, directing her biggest feature to date, does an excellent job on the appearance of the characters; perhaps assisted by a very good stylist and, especially with Jim Sturgess (Dexter), an equally able casting agent. Hathaway begins the film as Emma in '88' and it's an exactly how I had pictured her from the novel. As Emma peers at Dexter through bottletop glasses she sees a spitting image of the man I had in my head. Edinburgh at dawn captures the opening chapter perfectly; if the frame were to freeze then I'd believe the production to be a success. It doesn't, and as Hathaway opens her mouth I wonder if she's ever made a good movie. Her hopeless Yorkshire accent aside, she looks inept and puts in an all round uninterested performance. If this film was a boxing match and I was a judge I wouldn't give her a single round; she's out performed by someone in every scene. If I were an actor in this fight I'd have knocked her out for the count. Acting aside, the film is actually quite well made; the production qualities do British filmmaking proud. The opening scene in Edinburgh is an excellent example of top quality filming and beautiful colour grading: something for the Scottish tourist board. The music is sure to stay in your head until long after the final credits roll, excellently composed by Surrey born Rachel Portman. The titles work fantastically with the concept of the book, allowing us to understand the date changes in an original and aesthetically pleasing fashion. Benoît Delhomme, Director of Photography for book turned movie 'The boy in the striped pyjamas' used his experience to do a wonderful job with One Day's cinematography. His work adapting John Boyne's book for director Mark Herman was exemplary even if I do say so without having read the novel. I can say the motion picture was a brilliant piece of work that received plenty of well-deserved praise.Jim Sturgess actually plays an adequate Dexter. In particular his maturity over the many on screen years highlight his ability to actually act. Emma's character is arguably easier to play; her character doesn't change in the way Dexter's does. Her finest scene in fact is during the Paris rendezvous where we see some of the confidence that Hathaway herself most probably possesses. However she still manages to ruin that particular St Swithin's day with an unconvincing couple of lines along the river Siene when Emma threatens Dexter with death if he screws her over. Sturgess does remarkably well to muster up some emotion at the end of that scene, no doubt already accustomed to her placid acting by that stage. Rafe Spall, better known for the popular channel 4 show 'Pete Vs Life', plays Ian perfectly. Awkwardly funny and generally good to look at he battles with Hathaway and produces some of her better moments; unsurprisingly coming from actions not words. As he BBQ's his brunch or 'brinner' we see some genuine distaste as Emma loses her tolerance of him. Spurred on by his-life like desperation and perhaps some jealously of his acting ability Hathaway puts in her most credible performance of the film, showing us what a few years of romance with Rafe would do to the spirit. Still, she loses the scene to his playful humour, but this time it's to a worthy champion.The adaptation of One Day works well. The crew go to Edinburgh to start and end the film. Then they spend most of the time in London and explore France a couple of times. OK, so we don't get to visit the Greek Islands or get lost in any magnificent garden mazes but that doesn't matter. The film gets so much right that it doesn't need to stick to the script. The film is its own entity of a brilliant book and I'm in no doubt David Nicholls feels the same. Step up Anne Hathaway, everything about this British production worked yet her American influence ruined it all. I can envisage an American remake already; picture 'Death at a Funeral' and worse with Justin Timberlake as Dexter and Anne Hathaway as Emma. If she can ruin a perfectly good British production then the opportunities are endless stateside. More trust in talent grown this side of the pond please.",One Day

176,TheBobbyjames,'One Day' is an achievement in film acting and a beautiful love story,10,31 August 2011,"Very seldom in Hollywood are movies produced that are as emotionally involving as 'One Day.' It's a beautiful, beautiful love story of two people, Emma (Anne Hathaway) and Dex (Jim Sturgess). After spending the night together after graduation, we are taken on a journey into their lives for one day each year after they met; to see where they are or where they're not. Based on the book by David Nicholls (who also wrote the screenplay), 'One Day' transitions from novel to film brilliantly.First let me say film acting is what I believe makes or breaks a movie - if the actors are great, the movie is generally great. That's not to take away from any other element of film at all, but when everything else is done so well, if the acting were bad, the film would have been less memorable. But Anne Hathaway and Jim Sturgess are so very impressive here. They make their characters real and relatable, which are two key things every actor internally wishes they could do. In fact, as an on-screen pair, they work extremely well, together they exude chemistry.What I found most interesting about the entire experience was that I cared so much. I became enamoured with their lives. I kept hoping for the best. I anticipated what would happen to each of them. I sat forward, sat backward. I laughed and I cried. I've said many times before, a great movie will effect you emotionally in more ways than one. You'll be angry, you'll be happy, you'll be sad - the key is that you emote. This movie presented all of those elements. It was fresh and witty and everything you hope a movie will be. It's as beautifully made as it is acted and the locations are exquisite. Far too often, characters in Hollywood seem contrived and are not genuine. 'One Day' is honestly one of the most genuine stories ever told - there is no instant gratification, there is however frustration and that is the beauty of it all. It explores love and love lost, it explores friendship and the constraints of time and distance. It explores each character's journey to happiness and the trials they face along the way. So many little pieces of the puzzle are filled in between the years by simple, single lines of dialogue or actions. It's not the typical script of ""everything's all good-obstacle-everything ends well"" - there's a lot more complexity which makes it realistically genuine.So many little details, like eye-lines, smiles, sighs, cut-off conversations, etc. were paid attention to. The costuming, cinematography and score were spot on and all noteworthy. All of it combined was moving and awe-inspiring. I left the theater crying, but it didn't stop there, even thinking about the movie and those characters is deeply affecting. Maybe there are some underlying themes in the film that I'm identifying with, or maybe, just maybe the actors were really that great. Whatever it is, this film comes with my highest recommendation, is rated PG-13 and runs 107 minutes.",One Day

His facial movements alone made him more of character belonging to a light weight college dorm farce and not believable to me as a romantic lead or even an interest. Cast against Anne Hathaway, he was way out of his league. Even her generous talent made it impossible to overcome the miscasting of him. He used none of what seemed available to an actor with depth, say a Gosling or someone who can act in a subtle manners. The screenplay I also found light weight and dependent on 'cuteness' for depth. I found it boring and a waste of time. There is nothing about it I can recommend. It pulled Ms Hathaway down with all these other elements.",One Day

Anne Hathaway and Jim Sturgess make these characters who they are! Anne Hathaway channels the kind of personality she had back when she played in the Princess Diaries, a somewhat nerdy, shy girl that eventually blossoms. Jim Sturgess plays the role of player that eventually settles down and sees that life isn't all about partying.I will warn that this is an emotional roller coaster of a movie. It isn't necessarily a fast paced movie either but it is one that if watched you will become emotionally invested in and that's what makes this movie amazing!It is not your average romance movie of contrived plot lines that would never actually happen, instead every bit of this story feels real and that is why it should be watched.

I hated everyone in it, for a PG-13 the nudity was SHOCKING and the story was predictable.In the beginning, they established no chemistry. I didn't understand why Jim Sturgess would want anything to do with nerdy little Anne Hathaway. As it progressed, he became a complete jerk, womanizer, alcoholic and drug addict which made me wonder why Hathaway, the now teacher, would want anything to do with him (Because childhood crushes make it all okay?). Oh, but soon he meets a woman and is suddenly cured of all his addictions and problems. Because you become a responsible adult in like half a year and because of some woman who has no personality (they pretty much say that) and isn't likable. Nice.They go back and forth for like 10 years, which felt like it was in real time, before they finally get together. He has had a daughter with the woman that made him sober up (she cheated on him. Convenient) but our little turtledoves want a baby of their own. Anne Hathaway apparently can't have children. Cliché? It gets worse. She gets hit by a bus, which may or may not be the same bus from Final Destination with the way it just came out of no where going 800 mph.Well, Sturgess falls back into his alcoholic ways, getting into fights on that same day every year and his daughter basically thinks he's a bum... Probably because he is. Some lovely bonding time with Dad happens. Ugh. Years progress (why do we care about the story anymore if she's dead? I'm not sure, but the film makers thought we did) and him and his daughter get closer of course. The movie finally ends by kind of flashing back to the first day they hung out/literally slept together, where they contradict themselves and make no sense (him and her get all lovey dovey in the flashback, but then why wouldn't they have stayed together in the first place instead of the long mess we just endured).The characters were horrible, I hated all of them except his Dad who's just grumpy. Jim Sturgess' relationship with his mom is supposed to be close but is portrayed slightly creepy. She dies too. Anne Hathaway shouldn't have done an accent as she loses it a few times and it changes to cockney in a section too. I wasn't too sad when she was hit by the bus because her character is annoying and her acting made it worse. Sturgess didn't do anything good with his part either. You just hate him, he's a complete scumbag.After this, I doubt I'll ever see another movie from Hathaway or Sturgess. It was God awful. Don't even waste your money by renting it for a dollar.

184,ninispjc,Some just didn't get it...,9,17 September 2011,"In reading the reviews for this film, it seems to me that most people who strongly disliked this film either didn't really pay attention to it or just didn't get it. One main example being the criticism that Emma loving Dex in the first place never made any sense. Yes, he was a rascal in college, but let's be honest, he's exactly the kind of guy who got all the girls in college. After their ""near miss"" on the day they officially met, they did in fact become friends. He's the only one who helps Emma move, albeit grudgingly. And when she's feeling low about still working in that Mexican restaurant, he's the one who gives her a pep talk and supports her, and we can see he's sincere about what he tells her. When he loses his way and stops being a friend to her is when she breaks off contact with him. In fact, losing her is part of what makes him shape up, even though most of the credit is given to Sylvie. We later see, however, Sylvie is not the saving grace he thought she was.Also, some say there was no chemistry between the leads Jim Sturgess and Anne Hathaway. I suppose this is a subjective thing, but in the beach scene where he rubs sunblock on her back, I could FEEL heat coming off the screen for Pete's sake. Another criticism was Dex was a ""defeated"" man. I didn't see that at all. His television career was a big part of what led him astray. After it was over, he had to reinvent himself, starting from scratch. There's nothing ""defeated"" in a honest day's labor. This could be why Sylvie cheated and left, as she ""married up"" but in the humbleness of working hard to get his feet back on the ground, he did in fact become loving and decent just like his mother said he would, and by the time he and Emma were ready to plan their wedding, he was owner and operator of his own café, so he did become accomplished as well. He was hardly ""defeated."" I loved the nuances of the story. How Dex's relationship with his parents is never explicitly spelled out in dialogue, but we see how close he is with mom and how distant with dad through his interactions with them. I also loved the use of light to express time of day, how the street lights go out at the beginning, and when the end wraps up the story by returning to the rest of that first day they spend together, the street lights go on as dusk approaches. Like Hathaway said, ""they're talking, and their souls are having a totally different conversation."" That's the loveliness of this movie. Yes, sad things happen, but it ends on a very life-affirming note, as if to say, ""yes, it was worth it. Loving each other breaks their hearts at different times and they think they might not even survive it, but it was worth it."" It truly touches the heart of those who bother to understand what's going on.",One Day

Not the usual bumbling snobby Brit, but instead the he is the ultimate crush. Girls would love to have but would love to change in equal measure. Emma in the first few years of living in London is like most 20 something year old women. Feels unimportant and lost. Wants to feel young but longs for the important things in life to just start. Their relationship is great, you watch their ups and downs, and you feel like one of their friends in the background saying ""just get one with it will you!""

It is so beautifully made with the two main complex characters, which are incredibly well acted by Anne Hathaway and Jim Sturgess. The one element that I find vital in every movie is the music score. And Rachel Portman did not disappoint me. With the emotions from the music together with this amazing story, for me it's a ten.",One Day
187,howardo1,"Although poorly jumbled together, what's good here sticks with you.",6,3 April 2014,"Spread out across the foray of 20 years, two students from Edinburgh University Emma Morely (Anne Hathaway) and Dexter Mayhew (Jim Sturgess), meet every 15th July for those 20 years. Instantly attracted, but, at the same time, anxious towards each other, the film uses It's unorthodox framing device (Taken straight from the book) to narrate how the lives of the two are constantly changing, and how their fates seem to be intertwined. However, this seemingly eloquent way of telling the story falters when you get the inkling that a day is only enough time to express, not overcome their various problems.The characters are instantly attractive, however. Hathaway's bashful puppy-Dog eyes, and Sturgess' rugged look, give the characters contrasting feels, not only in their personalities, but, also in their looks. This is further reflected by the way they start the film- Emma is simply crawling along, and struggling to make any real success, whereas Dex comes out flying, instantly becoming a well-liked TV presenter. But, the way I would put It, is the two characters pace so differently, It creates a whole new magnetism between the two- Dexter is a firework, dazzling everyone to begin with, but, only for a moment. Emma is closer to a steady drum beat- not making any huge strides, rather, just plodding along till the next July 15th. However, there is a fundamental flaw in Emma's character, and that is she is being played by an American actress, who clearly was not given any help whatsoever in developing the correct accent for the role. Sometimes she's Scottish, other times, American, and, strangely enough, sounds like a Wallace and Gromit character. When this happens, It's usually during and emotional moment between the two leads, and In a film built entirely around that element, It can break immersion. Luckily, Hathaway puts on a solid enough emotional performance here to make Emma likable, but, she could've really shined had she just been told to use her normal speaking voice. Dex, on the other hand, is done in almost a utility role by Sturgess, showing us the worst, and the best parts of his character. He's a complete socio path, but, Emma's undying friendship and love for him redeems him, and makes us realise that the most shallow, stupid person, is still just a human. As for the film itself, It's a tricky one. You want to believe that this film is good because It's a story of undying love, friendship, and a lesson that life can be tragic. However, It never seems to want to play up that side too much till key moments, instead taking a breather every now and then to let you know what else is going on in the characters lives. And that's One Day's biggest fault- the only thing of any interest in this film is the hope that these two crazy love birds will suck their pride up and fall madly in love. Anything else is just boring.However, the one thing this film did best was make me believe these two characters were madly in love, and, I rooted for them, even though I knew how It ended. Despite tripping over itself a few times, It has a raw, minimalistic feel to the emotions shown, and should be praised for the conviction with which the characters were played. All In all, I find this film fleeting through my mind all too often, such Is the emotional impact I felt. Though It feels jumbled together, and can plod along too tamely at times, when It comes together, It does It so beautifully. I still get shivers down my spine whenever I see the promotional poster, reading ""Twenty years. Two people."". It's a nice thought Isn't It? One Day. One Day, It'll happen, love will ignite, and everything will finally be okay. Well, here's the kicker. One Day doesn't believe that itself. For a second.",One Day

The movie although goes at a snail speed but the characters grow on you, especially Emma. Anne Hathaway does a good job in giving life to Emma's character.The days of adolescence to more mature days of Emma's and Dexter's character are very well displayed on celluloid. The story gets a little disappointing during the start where after several years, life of both the characters is very much stagnant. the story picks up pace after Dexter and Emma decide to part ways from their friendship. the movie goes through a 360 degree turn which is kind of expected as the scene progresses.overall the movie is delight for a date movie or watching home on DVD. the cinematography is good.

For starters it was well filmed, as it is a movie that is counted by years at each change of year you can see that the characters have changed physically and the change is noticeable. It is not an ordinary movie. Usually most movies are filmed in a continuous time span, but this movie tells the story in different years but on the same day so I think that's a positive point. It's a movie that you can feel. Throughout the whole movie you will feel different emotions as this movie conveys many different emotions.It is also important to share that while it is a unique film, it also has some negative aspects. At the end a part of it is predictable the plot gives many twists and turns but at the end it is very predictable what is going to happen with the main characters so at the end you are not surprised by the situation as it should be.In conclusion the movie is not unique in the way and the periods in which it develops, it will make you feel frustrated, happy and it will transit emotions, it is a good movie to watch if you like movies of this type, I recommend it.",One Day

I had to watch it in 3 chunks as I would start dozing off within 20 minutes of it. In the book, I adored Emma. In the movie, I found her annoying. I like Anne Hathaway and all, but she made Emma come off as anal and snarky. Dexter was not the dreamy, irresistibly handsome man I had been picturing while reading the book. I understand that it must have been a difficult story to tell through film. Without the thoughts of the characters, we cannot get to know them enough to become emotionally invested in what ends up happening to them. But this movie seemed as if it was based off of a Cliff Notes version of the book rather than the actual book. And the music in some predictable scenes was so cheesy it made me groan. You always hear, ""oh the book is so much better than the movie"". That statement could not be any more true with ""One Day"".

Highly debatable, I guess if you are depressed -- I even doubt that group would label this as romantic.The two main characters meet for a one night stand in college and move on. How is that Romantic? There is no connection, no communication and no spark. The seem to live their own separate lives away from each other. They come together for unreal reasons that do not fit in real lie. I recognize the fact that this is a movie and should not be real; but since this is a boring one, it should at least keep the realism intact.The death of the main character in the middle of the movie led me to believe there were two sets of writers for the script; the ones who believed Greek tragedy is the way to go; the second group who believed Hamlet needs to be relived. Since These two could not agree on the direction, we are left with this nonsense. If you are planning a suicide, this is the movie to watch; sad, gloomy and very boring.

The story is drama and romance itself without the last 20 minutes. I wouldn't agree that Emma is weak, she has undetermined character though. Her love to Dexter and her faith is actually the Emma's drama. Dexter lost his part of life and Emma's love is his second chance, future and a gift. It's a pity that the story is not a happy end.

211,guest_pabby,Too many bitter reviewers...,9,3 September 2011,"After perusing other reviews for this movie, I believe that many of the ratings are low, not because viewers disliked the movie, but because they disliked the element in which the film shines. The film succeeds in drawing the audience into the friendship between the main characters, played by Jim Sturgess and Anne Hathaway. Both characters find happiness and meaning in parts of their lives, while suffering through other portions without attaining goals they've set for themselves; i.e., this is real life.What the poorly-rating reviewers seek is escapism. In my view--however limited--this film aims to depict two human beings as they learn, grow, and fall in and out of touch with one another. Thus, don't expect any fairy tales here and don't punish the rating on this movie because it isn't a fairy tale! A predictable conclusion to this movie would place Sturgess and Hathaway side by side, married, and living together untouched by the trials of a realistic relationship. Instead, the director effectively and with calculation showcases some of life in the scenes and merely hints at events not shown on the screen. As the film narrates exclusively through one date each year (hence, the name), partial narratives are expected. The final third of the film, shunned by a few reviewers, elevated the creative vision of the story because it introduces the unpredictable nature of real life into a movie that was otherwise a run-of-the-mill romance. Again, speaking in terms of the development between characters, the movie is above average. Speaking in terms of storyline, the first two-thirds, to a certain degree, lack what the final third delivers: surprise! The juxtaposition of the present with the past near the end of this film makes the events even more potent than they would have been. Audience members who do not fall into the ""half-wit"" category can follow the story, regardless of what the viewers who read the novel state in their reviews. Bravo! Lastly, Anne Hathaway is exceedingly lovely.",One Day
212,life-in-elsewhere,"""She made you decent, and in return you made her so happy""",8,4 September 2011,"Adapted from a David Nichllos's best seller, One Day is another story about soul mate. The romance begins at the graduation day of Emma and Dex. They were to have sex but happened to be friends. During the following 20 years, they either called or met with each other on July 15th to share their life. They attracted each other, encouraged each other when experiencing lows of life, and made them grow mature. Esecailly Emma, loved and inspired Dex all the time even when he has, as he has said, screwed up his life and career. Finally, they made a real relationship. But Emma died in a car accident in her way to see Dex, which is an imperfect but impressive ending.""She made you decent, and in return you made her so happy."" This is how soul mates work. Dex attracts Emma with his romance and imagination, which to some extent inspire Emma's desire for life beauty deep in her mind. This, I think, is an important resource of her later works. But at that time, Dex was also a laissez-fairer play boy, indulgent in drugs, alcohols and unstable sexual relationship with blonds. Inner in his mind, Dex doesn't like this kind of life. But these are what he used to be all the years. Change one's settled patterns can be really difficult sometimes. But later, his mother died of cancer, he failed in his career and marriage. When he""screwed up his career, screwed up his own life"", as he said himself, Emma is the one that encourages him, loved him, and give him the light and peace of life. Even though in the end of the story, they still cannot be together, so what? Love makes them happy, makes them live better.Besides the story, the music and scenes are really great. Music by Rachel Portman is always one of my favorite. Melodies with violin and piano make me feel that I'm so close the nature beauty, which is in great harmony with the natural scenes in the movie. Still remember they two driving in the country road, with white rose petals flying in the wind; Still remember they two lying in the bed together in the night, doing nothing, just sleeping, with moonlight and shadow of leaves flowing in them; Still remember they two running all the way from the golden hills to the London street in the morning, and kissing.As for the stars, I think Anne Hathaway is just OK. But Jim Sturgess is really good, I think. He has displayed Dex's early laissez-fairer and later maturity through his eyes very well. Altogether, I think it's a good movie, with extraordinary stories, music, scenes, and stars.",One Day

Dexter woke up still on graduation day, in Emma's bed, and together he hiked up the hill with Emma. On their way down, they pass the future Dexter and his daughter a la Sliding Door style...My take is that the whole movie was a dream by Dexter, who woke up still in 1988 and realized that Emma was the true love of his life.

And both did touch me from deep inside. We can all see how much they gave to each other. They cared and depended way much much more than they considered. But since while, they lost their 13 years of life to come together, 13 years! since the day they first ""actually"" met, and all that time they'd been in misery and desperation and loss so many times - which they might not have been through if they realized what to do right, especially Dex. I've nearly gone mad while seeing the scene they skinny-dip, they're always missing their moments! I know partly, it's because it's not their moment yet but, gosh, it's really difficult to watch that, and reading after. Anyway the movie is great, not as wonderful as the book but nearly most well-adapted i've ever seen. The cast is good, i don't know why someone says Jim is not as expected, i think he did a great job being Dexter: all that caring and longing and loving to Emma but not good at expression - that's the problem. And Anne, don't know why but i always feel that the female characters are always stronger and tougher than the male ones and that's how i feel to her.It's the same as what i read so she's fine here.

Emma is very smart and a bit contained i guess. Overall i thought this movie was OK but come on the ending could have been a whole lot better.

There just aren't enough intelligent romantic movies and this seemed to be the perfect thing. Unfortunately, this movie was utterly disappointing. The story evolves around two completely different people who would be perfect for each other. Yet, somehow the characters are so stereotypical that it soon becomes a sport to watch how many stereotypical scenes and characters can still be added to one movie. Everything in this movie is a cliché - from a TV-show host doing drugs and blond chicks to a writer with short hair living in Paris to a bad stand-up comedian who keeps making bad jokes and wearing ""funny"" clothing. The writers wanted to keep the story diverse and the people constantly changing and they succeeded. The movie is entertaining to watch, and it's nice to see the characters evolve from one stereotype to another stereotype. And then they go too far with the stereotypical Hollywood movie'ish situations and then the movie just leaves a bad taste in your mouth and regret for watching the movie. If too many people watch it, movie-makes might be fooled to think that this is what women expect to see in a movie. I hated the ending because it only made the movie worse. The movie is engineered entertainment for women who want to watch a romantic movie. It's a compilation of movie clichés and could seem novel and interesting only to people who have never seen any other movies of this genre. 10 stars to the actors, -6 stars for the bad story writing.",One Day
222,sheelaa,Disappointing,2,6 July 2012,"One Day, I wasted 107 of my precious minutes. There is not one snippet of this film's plot that gives a reason why two extraordinarily good-looking individuals should not be together, yet the first half of the film forces the viewer to watch Emma and Dexter dance timidly around each other like two misplaced blunt trauma victims. The only redeeming quality of this atrocity masquerading as a movie is Anne Hathaway's chic gamine haircut, which fortunately manages to overshadow her horrible British accent for part of the film. After her last project, ""An Education (one of my absolute favorites), Lone Scherfig disappoints with this atrocity masquerading as a movie.",One Day

It seems everything already happened rush into your mind, everything would happened come into your eyes. There are also some certain scene make me can't control myself.Love is not for young and passions, the only reason you cant stand the test of time is, that is not the true love. Also like the sentence in NOTEBOOK, the first time you fall in love, it changes your life forever, and no matter how hard you try, the feeling' never goes away.

224,taher-mhq,How the time leads the life,10,11 June 2013,"Well i actually was going to give a ""7"" to this movie, but i changed my mind and made it a ""10"", cause it really involved my emotions. I actually cried for the first time after seeing about 100 movies in a row. This is the most important characteristic of the movie i assume.. To feel the Characters so intimate and similar to oneself. The story line is quite direct. however it's been told in a modern way. The events seem absolute real. We see a long period of life with all its glories and sorrows. It shows how the time change us and our lives and how easy it would be, to lose a fantastic partner or a friend. The both characters are really believable. Jim Sturgess has played well, but Anne Hathaway was absolutely brilliant. The film has a good beginning and ending and i think it had no extra sequence. Along with these should it be considered that some of the actors like Ian for example are not very well settled. Overall i can't call this a masterpiece, but definitely this is a movie which worth to watch.",One Day
225,emily-sawyer94,Best movie of all time,10,8 April 2016,"This is one of two films that I could never get sick of watching. It is such a beautiful film with an amazing plot line. Since the first time I watched this film, I have watched it every year since on July the 15th (once you watch the film you will get this reference). It is also one of the few films that are better than the books, which I also thoroughly enjoyed. Be warned - it is a bit of a tear jerker and makes me cry every time I watch it (there are very few films I usually cry in). Both the main actors are phenomenal - and I can even get with Anne Hathaway's English accent. I would definitely recommend this film to anyone and everyone!",One Day

227,liliaoseguera,"Predictable at times, but worth the watch.",8,20 July 2014,"Unlike most reviewers who believe that one should wait a while before reviewing a movie, lest they carelessly ramble on the basis of emotion, I believe that the initial emotion is the most important and therefore my review is based only on that. The emotion throughout. The emotion at the end. Because after all, this movie does not rely on special effects, it does not rely on scenery, it does not rely on fooling the audience into a false reality, it relies on stirring up something within the viewer. The way the characters unfolded was realistic, no fantasy involved so the audience could get what they expected, but instead it focused on the development of two characters and the ups and downs of their relationship, but most importantly the ups and downs of life in general. Life is no way near perfect, and neither was this film. But it evoked within me a sense of urgency in life, the one we all have at moments when we think a little too much and our minds wanders into an almost existential whirlwind. Just like me, I'm sure you are aware this review says nothing at all. Nevertheless, this movie manages to say something. And this ""something"" made me reflect on my own life. Thus the high rating.",One Day
228,kalim101,Very Real!,8,30 December 2014,"One Day portrays the lives of Emma Morley and her best friend/almost-lover Dexter every July 15th. Sometimes they meet up, but sometimes we just see glimpses of their lives. I really enjoyed this film because Emma and Dexter didn't fall in love immediately, they were really good friends. Jim Sturgess portrays Dex magnificently, and Anne Hathaway is pretty good as Emma, even though her accent is eh. I think this movie was aiming to be realistic, an ordinary beautiful romance. It was convincing, but at some points, it was difficult to feel what the characters were feeling. Nevertheless, I really enjoyed following the lives of Dex and Emma and of course their relationships with each other The ending was unexpected",One Day
229,Piccadilly11,"No, they don't ""meet"" on the same day every year, and this is not ""Same Time Next Year""",9,7 June 2012,"** CONTAINS SPOILERS** I am so weary of reading summaries that claim the two main characters decide to meet on July 15th of every year. That is not the case here at all, although I know other movies have followed that conceit. Here, we are allowed glimpses into the lives of Emma and Dexter on July 15th of each year. Sometimes they are together, sometimes they are not, but there is no pre-arranged agreement that they will meet every year on this date. There is a period of a few years when they don't even speak, but we still see them as individual characters on July 15th. They are not having an affair every year on July 15th, meeting on that day every year, while they are married/involved with others. Not only is constantly reading that annoying, but I think it does a disservice to the movie, which is so much more than that. How much do we ALL change over the course of 20 years? It's interesting to think about what a glimpse of anyone's life might be on the same day, every year, for that long. This is a real relationship story, as well as a story of the personal journeys of the main characters. The ending - and the years leading up to it - is not neat and tidy and parts will make viewers angry and emotional. Isn't that what a good movie is supposed to do?",One Day
230,fadymagdy1993,Don't let your love go.,6,8 September 2017,"As a person who is fond of Anne Hathaway , i thought that i would like this movie whatever it was talking about.But once i watched the first 20-30 minutes, i recognized that it was talking about something different, about something deeper which is going on in our whole life.the movie is talking about falling in love .. but not just that, it's shows what happens to you after you fall in love .. instead of expressing your love and let it out, and show the one you loved how much you appreciate him/her.You start to get confused, ask yourself question that has nothing to do except complicating your life.and the real question which appears from the first hour is why, why we get confused in love, why we can't deal with our relations as easy as we deal with any thing in our life, why when it get to love it becomes so that difficult.the last thing we can say that this movie tried to say ... you have to be responsible for your choices but remember you have only one love to live.",One Day
231,anusfinder,"Not exciting, but long",4,4 April 2015,"It's a love story that slowly tells itself and shows the personal development of the characters. The scenes were well chosen, but the characters were shallow. They had this British typical inability to deal with emotional stuff though; however, it only meant over two hours of agony. The characters evolved normally. No ridiculous stuff. Still not recommended. No real plot twists that were surprising. The beautiful scenery and authentic decors are not enough to make a movie worth watching for more than 2 hours. The end was no surprise to me at least. The movie got me bored at middle the night, at a hospital, with nothing else to do. Watching commercials could have been more fresh.",One Day
232,becca_berg,One Day Storms the Theaters,5,1 October 2015,"One Day will fulfill all your chick-flick needs. This British romantic comedy does a great job at hitting all the stereotypes and will leave you laughing, crying, and conflicted. This film uses unique filters, interesting camera angles, and well-known actors to cover up the lack-luster plot line. One Day is a romantic comedy that follows the lives of two friends who are flirting on the line of a relationship. Emma, the nerdy female love interest played by Anne Hathaway, finds herself in bed with Dexter, a handsome male played by Jim Sturgess, which quickly turns south and they decide to be friends instead. The film follows the two almost-lovers as the progress through the ups and downs of life while attempting to maintain their friendship. The stereotypical plot shows both friends date the wrong people at different times with their timelines frustratingly never quite matching up. The Director adds a blueish gray filter periodically throughout the film to emphasize the gloomy content of various scenes. While this technique works well for tragic scenes, it gives an off-kilter feeling for scenes that would otherwise be cute and romantic. This filter may aide the film in taking your emotions on a roller coaster ride – as you might expect from a romance movie – but upon closer examination, the filter seems overdone and out of place. The well-known Anne Hathaway's acting turned out to be subpar and was overshadowed by her co-star, Jim Sturgess. The chemistry seemed to be lacking between the couple and only seemed to pick up when Jim incorporated that knowing stare that can only be given to someone you truly love. The accents seemed to waver as the years go on and it was difficult to tell if this was intentional or a slip in the acting. When the accents were present, they sounded forced and annoying, but is it even a rom-com if the male lead doesn't have a sexy accent? The flirting and awkward moments between the two friends aren't quirky and unique, they are overused and expected. The film included an awkward encounter between Dexter's wealthy parents and Emma that has been seen in every romantic comedy done before this one. The aesthetic seemed a tad off as the film progressed through the years. The clothing only had minimal changes as they covered a time span of almost 30 years. If it wasn't for the text telling you what year it was, it would be difficult to differentiate between the progression of time and flashbacks. One Day is the perfect film to watch when you just want to see a predictable love story. The story line isn't original, but it touches on everything that makes a romantic comedy such a popular genre. This film will have you crying and laughing as you reminisce on relationships that could have been, but in the end you will be lacking the feeling of love. The film is missing a sense of plausibility that makes it difficult to relate to and will therefore not be your favorite movie, but may be good enough to occasionally snuggle-up under the covers to watch.",One Day
233,sachspindoria,Hard to watch,3,24 September 2021,As a lover of rom-coms even I can admit this movie is sub-par.

241,zandieh-41292,Theme has been done before but here there is no chemistry,4,25 February 2019,"Anne Hathaway's performance was good in this movie. I find her consistently good. But the character of Dex was unconvincing and badly acted out. There was practically no chemistry between the two main characters leading me to not really root for their relationship to happen. Usually movies like this will make me cry and this did nothing to me. I had no emotion because the characters don't bring any emotion out in you.Let's face it this movie theme has been done before so the story isn't unique either.I don't know how the producer didn't see that this movie has no charisma or emotion or charm and the acting is subpar and unbelievable but that is probably the main issue with it.If you like this type of movie I'd recommend Love Rosie. It's the same friendship turned love story except in that one the characters have a really great connection and you're rooting for them to end up together, it doesn't have the terrible ending and the storyline is much more interesting. It even has the same pool scene, the same druken night, the same sick parent, the same one person getting married and having a kid and the same fight and separation period. Except it's much much better.I wouldn't recommend One Day.",One Day
