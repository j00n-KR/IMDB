0,TheLittleSongbird,"Love, legacy and loss in the most unique and unconventional, but also oddly haunting and beautiful, ghost story",8,22 August 2017,"It is easy to fooled by 'A Ghost Story's' title. A somewhat generic if intriguing title that is suggestive of a standard horror film/ghost story. Having read reviews and done research on what to expect, just in case it was much more than initially seemed, it was clear that the title was a misleading one that is not to be fooled by.Despite its critical acclaim, 'A Ghost Story' will be a divisive film, and has already shown signs of being so in the audience reaction (though still mostly positive as of now). It is a film that will leave some moved and absorbed and others alienated and perplexed. Can see both sides as a perceptive person and being one of few people to be so, be accepting of opinions, positive or negative, and review in a manner that aims to be evaluative and without resorting to condescension, personal attacks on critics or endeavouring to prove the general consensus wrong.With me, it was the former for 'A Ghost Story'. It is the most unique ghost story personally seen, and certainly the most unconventional, being much more than a horror film and the complete opposite of one. Instead it is a sombre and contemplative study of love, legacy and loss and does it in a way that's thoughtful, moving, oddly haunting and truly beautiful. It has the fluidity and mystic of Malick, the meditative pacing of Tarkovsky, the unusual atmosphere of 'Twilight Zone', the melancholy of 'Ghost' and somewhat the eccentricity (though very mild rather than wacky) of 'Beetle Juice', but has enough to set it apart and made its own in a hugely atmospheric, unusually experimental and profoundly moving depiction of the supernatural and the sensitive and tactfully handled themes of love, legacy and loss.'A Ghost Story' is beautifully and atmospherically photographed, with the kitchen sink of all types of cuts and doing lots of inventive things with each. The lighting is unsettlingly creepy in places and oddly attractive in others, and the minimal setting never looks cheap. The budget was not big for this film but it didn't need to be, this was a perfectly necessary and very effective example of not doing a huge amount, and potentially being muddled and over-complicating things, and still work. ""Less is more"" can be done very well in film, 'A Ghost Story' is a good example. Oh and the ghost costume is suitably creepy and doesn't look cheap at all.Music score is sorrowful, soulful and haunting, giving a real sense of eeriness and also nuance. 'A Ghost Story' does have moments of unsettlement, but not in terms of scares but the portrayal of the ghost and the questions it raises that makes one think but also unnerved. Essentially it explores sensitive themes and does so remarkably tactfully and delicately. It's slow and deliberate but the rich atmosphere, balance of emotions and compelling performances make it compelling. A few parts are too drawn out and go on a little too long, but not enough to make the whole film a bore.Casey Affleck and Rooney Mara give delicately understated performances, ones that are utterly transfixing and more than great performances in their own right. Mara is particularly good, but Affleck has a hard task making an impact despite being a ghost and covered in a sheet for almost the whole running time, which he excels wonderfully in. The supporting cast are also solid but it's Affleck and particularly Mara that one remembers. Lowery's direction is accomplished and wisely keeps things simple.In fact a strength of 'A Ghost Story' is how it doesn't rely on a huge budget, complex narratives and a large cast to stand out. Instead the budget is somewhat limited but sure doesn't look it, the narrative is simple and unconventional but emotionally and atmospherically rich and has two extremely compelling lead performances, and it shows the beauty of not trying to do too much and it registers much more than a lot of potentially overblown blockbusters.The weak link of 'A Ghost Story' is the script. It's wisely kept at minimum, and when it is used while parts are thought-provoking the more philosophical pieces of dialogue come over as a little self-indulgent.Summing up, hugely impressive. Won't be for all tastes, but if seen knowing what to expect it is more likely to be rewarding than frustrating. 8/10 Bethany Cox",A Ghost Story
1,Leofwine_draca,Silly arthouse fare,2,21 January 2019,"A GHOST STORY is the kind of film that receives praise in Hollywood these days, but for the life of me I can't see what the fuss is about. The idea has value, for sure, but the look of the ""ghost"" is a ridiculous bit of self-referencing post-modernism and one you won't be able to take seriously. The film's pace is slow and languid, the story limited, the characters non-existent. It tells exactly the same story as the Hollywood blockbuster GHOST with Patrick Swayze, except lacking in basic narrative drive and storytelling. A pretentious mess, in other words.",A Ghost Story
2,SnoopyStyle,a little different,6,7 November 2017,"A couple (Casey Affleck, Rooney Mara) lives in a house. He dies in a car crash in front of their home. At the hospital, he rises wearing a sheet like a ghost costume with two eye holes. He haunts her unseen by anybody. She moves out leaving him behind.This is the type of film where his ghost watches her angrily eat a pie for four full minutes in a continuous static shot. It's more art than a movie. Filmmaker David Lowery achieves what he's trying to do. The first half reminds me of Truly Madly Deeply. That movie has other gears for the actor to play with. This movie stays with that one gear. I waited for the second gear and it transitioned with an interesting turn.The young family provides an opportunity to make a traditional haunting story. In fact, that's what I expected but it didn't happen. The movie take another turn. While the last act is poetic, I wonder if the haunted house would be more intense. It would probably work just as well in a shortened montage leading into the loop.The sheet ghost may be a striking visual but a sheet without eye holes would be more logical. This look is one step away from Charlie Brown. At best, it's ET. A sheet without eye holes could be very haunting but it's hard to take this look seriously. Overall, this has an interesting different idea although the execution leaves this strictly in the art-house.",A Ghost Story
3,Horst_In_Translation,"I liked it, I felt it was deep and touching",6,11 December 2017,"""A Ghost Story"" is an American 1.5-hour film from very recently, a 2017 release written and directed by David Lowery and if you take a look at his profile page, you will see what an amazingly multi-talented person (not just filmmaker) he is. Here he has two of Hollywood's finest siblings at his disposal: recent Oscar winner Casey Affleck as well as recent Oscar nominee Rooney Mara. They play a couple heading into a final direction when Affleck's character dies and returns as a ghost stuck between the world of the living and the world of the dead. Nothing wrong here with the acting at all, even if I must say that Mara was probably the MVP here, especially shining for example in the eating scene. A complete scene stealer here was Will Oldham with his Beethoven moment, in which was the best scene of the film without a doubt and a contender too for best scene of the entire year. It added some raw authenticity away from the Mara(-Affleck) plot. This was when the film came the closest to greatness and it made it a really difficult decision to me if it is a good or great film really.I am a bit surprised to see that the film's rating here is under 7, but I guess some may have struggled with the visual side of the ghost perhaps as honestly early on you may think it is ridiculous and taken out of a spooky little kids film, but the longer this one goes, the more you get used to it and you are actually glad that this is the way he looks eventually. So another well done to Lowery. What did I struggle with? Maybe towards the end, the film switches too fast between years and sceneries, even if the settlers scene and its heartbreaking brutality still should not have been left out by any means. The other ghost next door also added a lot and that we see two ghosts together was a bit predictable at times. I also liked how they had the sheet sink to the ground in depicting life vanishing from the spirits and completing the transition to the dead. So yes there is a lot to like here. I would say that this was one of the most different films I have seen all year and a truly creative approach, idea and execution that makes it somewhat difficult for me to give this one only *** out of ***** stars.It seems that so little happens because of how rigid the ghost character is. He is basically watching the events with us. But still so so much happens indeed over the course of such long periods of time. It is certainly one of the better if not best films I have seen about grief and losing a loved one in quite a while. A great addition to their resumés for everybody really working on this one behind and in front of the camera. The atmospheric take is as magnificent as the sound work. There are long periods without people talking and without us hearing any music, but what we hear and when we here it is really top-notch. This film had me wonder how many ghosts were there in the cinema while I was watching, so it did make an impact on me for sure. The fantasy genre is not really to my liking, but here it sure was. It's such a pity that in my showing I was the only one watching an extraordinary film like this and I am genuinely worried, though not surprised, about this film not getting half the commercial success it should. Do something against that injustice if it plays anywhere near you. This is one you definitely want to see on the big screen. With your significant other in particular. For your own sake, please don't get distracted by the ghost's looks early on. This product was a truly artistic achievement overall. Very much recommended.",A Ghost Story

5,classicsoncall,"""..you do what you can to make sure you're still around after you're gone.""",5,3 September 2019,"This movie might, I say might not have been as bad if the appearance of the ghost wasn't so downright comical. At least for me it was; the black eye holes gave Casey Affleck's 'ghost' the look of a cartoon character, and that sentiment stayed with me throughout the picture. And who's to say that Casey Affleck remained under the sheet the entire time? Just like that iconic Universal character The Mummy, you could put anyone in there and get away with less than half the expense of a major celebrity, so why hire someone like Boris Karloff in the original, or Brendan Fraser in the modern day remakes. Just being practical there with the payroll, you know.I guess one could make the case that there was some profound message in the story on the themes of love lost and the ethereal passage of time, but the unconventional manner in which this was filmed makes it more inaccessible than anything else. And that character listed on the credits page for the film as the Prognosticator (Will Oldham), well, he was just a barrel of laughs, wasn't he? Let's invite him to our next party.I hate to be the bearer of bad news here, but this picture just didn't do it for me. I stayed with it longer than I needed to in order to get some inspiration out of it, which is to say I hung in right until the very end. I might have felt better if we got to see the note left by Rooney Mara's character, but even there, a missed opportunity. No need to catch this flick unless the spirit moves you.",A Ghost Story
6,jboothmillard,A Ghost Story,6,16 August 2017,"I saw the trailer for this film in the cinema, I was definitely intrigued by it, I found out later it was well rated following its release at the Sundance Film Festival, I was willing to try something different, directed by David Lowery (Pete's Dragon). Basically C (Casey Affleck) is a struggling musician living with his wife M (Rooney Mara) in a small suburban house. One night they hear a loud bang come from the piano, but they cannot find the cause of the noise. Some time later, C is killed in a car accident outside their home. At the morgue, C awakens as a ghost, covered by a white sheet with two black holes for eyes, he wanders aimlessly through the hospital, but no one can see him. In the hallway, a doorway with a bright flashing light appears in the wall, C stares at it a few moments, but it disappears, he then leaves the hospital and walks the long journey back to the house. The unseen ghost of C watches M grieve over his death, over days and weeks, while doing so he meets another ghost inside the house opposite, she says that she is waiting for someone, but cannot remember who. One night M returns to the house with a new boyfriend, angered he makes the lights flicker and throws books to the floor. Some time later, M listens to a song that C made when he was alive, she finally decides to move from the house, before leaving she places a small piece of paper inside a crack in the corner of the wall, and painting it over. C's ghost is left alone and begins to pick away the paint from the corner, but he is distracted by a Hispanic single mother Maria (Sonia Acevedo) and her young son Carlos (Carlos Bermudez) and daughter Yasmina (Yasmina Gutierrez) moving into the house, he observes them for many months. Eventually C's ghost makes his presence known, deeply aggravated by boredom and loneliness he flickers the lights and throws plates from the cupboard, frightening the family, they move out from the house. C's ghost observes new occupants throwing a party, he listens to one of the guests, a Prognosticator (Will Oldham), go on a nihilist thesis about humanity's collective efforts, and how no matter what is created and efforts made to try and preserve that legacy, it will all disappear when the world eventually ends and the universe collapses on itself again, the party goers disappear after the lights begin to flicker. After some time, the abandoned house has become derelict, C's ghost continues trying to pick at the corner in the wall, he is almost able to pull out the paper, until a bulldozer levels both his house and the house belonging to the other ghost. The two ghosts stand in the ruins, the other ghost says she doesn't think the person she is waiting for is coming, causing her figure beneath her sheet to vanish, leaving just her sheet. C's ghost watches on as the site his house used to be is becoming a skyscraper, he walks around the construction site until its completion, a futuristic cityscape now stands where his neighbourhood once stood, he walks to and plunges off the edge of the building to the bottom. Upon waking up, C's ghost finds himself in a land of coarse grass and shrubs, there 19th century settlers are setting up camp, he watches the little girl of the family writing on a piece of paper, placing it under a rock. Suddenly the sound of Native Americans are heard in the distance, turning his back, C's ghost finds the settlers have been slaughtered, he gazes as the little girl decomposes and the land and grass begins enveloping her. He waits until he's once again inside his old home, just as an alive C and M are moving in, he watches their entire relationship playing out before him inside the house. One night, C's ghost sits on the piano, creating the loud noise that was heard earlier when C was alive. Eventually C's ghost watches M moves out from the house once again, as the other C (now a ghost) watches her leave from the window, but he goes to the corner and is able to take out the piece of paper, upon opening it and reading what is written, C's figure disappears and leaves his now discarded sheet behind. Also starring Rob Zabrecky as Pioneer Man, Liz Franke as Linda and singer Kesha as Spirit Girl. Affleck before and after putting on the children's Halloween party style costume, and Mara as the grieving wife, give delicate performances, and the direction by Lowery is very simplistic. It has long sequences with little or no movement and complete silence, including the morgue sequence, and Mara just on the floor eating a pie, when there is dialogue it is either philosophical or mundane, the ghosts communicating is silent with subtitles, and there is a soulful music score by Daniel Hart, it is obvious as being an independent, low-budget movie, it is odd and haunting, maybe not to everyone's tastes, but a surprisingly worthwhile supernatural drama. Good!",A Ghost Story
7,Quinoa1984,If only they had the Handbook for the Recently Deceased...,8,3 March 2018,"This isn't in my favorites group of 2017 - I found it more fascinating as a pure experimental film than an emotional one - but its mere existence is encouraging for cinema in general. I'm reminded of how Nicholson once said Kubrick told him during the making of The Shining that any movie that has ghosts is a hopeful story because it means there is something after we die. Director David Lowry, who is a filmmaker with one of the most striking points of view in cinema today (also see Ain't Them Bodies Saints) is saying in essence: no. There is no hope. There's only the vast loneliness of time. It's not meant to be comforting, but there is in the film the idea of something mattering enough that a ghost stays (the ghost in the house next door, and the object keeping Ghostfleck in his home through, uh, various stages of time as he sorta gets unstuck in it I guess) and that is something that keeps one from not slitting wrists by the end. It's an Elliott Smith song of a movie.I'm also glad another film from 2017 was able to have a better kind of memorable scene involving food (this pie vs Call me By Your Name's peach). The way that pie scene is paced is extraordinary.",A Ghost Story
8,michaelRokeefe,Philosophical drama,2,16 September 2021,"A young man (Casey Affleck) suffers a tragic death and returns to the house as a sheet-covered ghost and stands around in the home for years and observes various people move in and move out. The occupants love, argue, play, fight, cry and go through various mundane activities of living. If you don't have much patience, you'll be giving up very quickly. Probably the most average viewer will find nothing over redeeming.",A Ghost Story
9,evanston_dad,Rewards Patience,8,4 December 2017,"Most movies that treat the death of a loved one as a key narrative device focus on the living and their ways of dealing with grief. Ghosts, or the spirits of the departed, frequently make an appearance, but their objective always seems to be to smooth the way for those left among the living. When that's not their objective, they're here to haunt and the movie is more likely to be a horror film. It's much more rare to see a story about the grief that comes with death from the ghost's perspective (unless it's a gimmick movie like ""The Sixth Sense""), and even rarer for a film to suggest that dying might be harder for those that die than those that stay behind. The predominant cultural point of view would have us believe that death is something to be embraced, because we're moving on to something better and will see our loved ones soon. But ""A Ghost Story"" suggests that the things that tie us to this world are harder to let go of than we might be prepared for, and that the hardest thing about dying will be watching those we love move on without us. Casey Affleck plays the ghost and Rooney Mara plays the wife he leaves grieving for him, and both are very good, but this isn't a showcase for actors. Instead, it's a showcase for visual storytelling, and David Lowery, the director, makes some daring choices -- like having Affleck covered in a sheet the entire time like the kind of ghost you'd see on Halloween -- that could have failed miserably but that for the most part all work wonderfully. As the narrative moves forward, the film becomes progressively unstuck from any one time and place, and becomes more a rumination on humankind's place in the universe than the story of any one man or woman.The movie will likely try your patience. It certainly did mine. As many others have pointed out, the pie-eating scene is a tough one to get through and left me wondering if I was going to make it through the film. But my patience was rewarded, which is all I ask from films that are going to challenge me to sit through them, as this one starts off by doing.I felt while watching ""A Ghost Story"" like I was seeing something that wasn't quite like anything I'd seen before, high praise from me.Grade: A",A Ghost Story
10,AlsExGal,Metaphysical meditation on the afterlife,8,24 November 2019,"From A24 and writer-director David Lowery. An unnamed couple live in a modest home but are discussing moving out. The man (Casey Affleck) is killed in a car crash, but returns to the home as a ghost, where he watches over the woman (Rooney Mara) go about her daily activities. As time progresses, things change, and the ghost's existence becomes lonelier and fragmented.Writer-director Lowery's artistic pretensions are conspicuous and will prove hard to overcome for many viewers. The most glaring issue is the visual representation of the ghost: he always appears as a white sheet with two black eye holes cut out. Once he becomes the ghost, star Affleck is never seen or heard again, only as a shrouded figure. It's a ridiculous image that takes a while to get past, especially when there are scenes lasting up to 8 minutes of the ghost standing by as Mara eats an entire pie in silence. And there's a lot of silence; the dialogue in the script could fit on a couple of pages of paper.
This is more of a visual mood piece, with heavy use of music, which itself borders on the ridiculous with its at-times overblown ponderousness.All that being said, I liked the movie, much more than Lowery's prior efforts. I'm a sucker for the metaphysical, and while some of the existential philosophy espoused by characters is a little too junior-college-intellectual nihilistic, the ultimate message of the film is of spiritual weight, and a unique look at what could come after physical death. This movie will most certainly not be for everyone, but some will get quite a bit from it.",A Ghost Story
11,ferguson-6,Original and creative,7,19 July 2017,"Greetings again from the darkness. We've not previously seen a movie like this latest from writer/director David Lowery. Detractors will likely roll their eyes and ask ""and why would we?"", while those who find a connection here will pontificate endlessly on the existential meaning of life, love, loss and legacy. Polarized reactions to the film will lead to some colorful post-viewing discussions  exactly what would be expected from an artsy non-horror movie entitled A Ghost Story.Yes, there is a ghost. However this ghost is neither friendly Casper nor angry spirit. Instead, for the vast majority of the run time, we see a white sheet covered Casey Affleck (at least we are told it's him) standing in static melancholic repose. We do initially meet Affleck's composer character in what appears to be a somewhat normal up-and-down relationship with his wife, played by Rooney Mara. In the midst of a passive-aggressive argument about whether to move from their somewhat dumpy suburban rental, Affleck's character is killed in an automobile accident mere feet from their driveway. We next see him back in the house, draped in a bedsheet (one way to keep wardrobe costs under control), and watching his grief-stricken wife through blackened eye holes.We come to understand that the ghost is confined to the home and time seems to bounce from present to future to past. The residents change, but the ghost doesn't. Periodically the ghost flashes anger or some other act that disrupts the real world, but mostly he just stands and observes longingly.A word of caution is in order. This is a deep cut, art house indie that features very little dialogue, almost no plot, and numerous extended fixed shots with no payoff for your anticipation. Oh, and it's shot in the old fashioned almost square aspect ratio. There are no creepy clowns under the bed or in the storm drains, and there is an absence of cheap jump-scares (OK, there is one that is the director's prank on the audience). This is more abstract experimental filmmaking than traditional horror, so choose your viewing partner accordingly.Filmmaker Lowery previously collaborated with Affleck and Mara on the critically acclaimed 2013 Ain't Then Bodies Saints, and this one was filmed in secret just after Lowery completed Pete's Dragon. It takes a meditative approach to some of the issues we all ponder at times. Lines such as ""We do what we can to endure"", and ""You do what you can to make sure you're still around after you're gone""  these provide the clues when you begin to wonder what the film is trying to tell you. In fact, it isn't telling you anything. It's encouraging you to think. The film may lack a traditional narrative structure, but if taken with an open mind, it can generate some introspection that most movies wouldn't even attempt to inspire.In addition to Affleck and Mara, the small cast also includes Liz Cardenas Franke (the film's producer) as the landlord, and singer-songwriter Will Oldham as a hipster philosopher/prognosticator who is given entirely too much screen time. Daniel Hart contributes an excellent use of music – especially considering the minimal dialogue and non-existent special effects. The film doesn't solve the mysteries of the universe, but it does answer the question of whether Rooney Mara can eat an entire pie in one uninterrupted shot. Expect descriptions as disparate as: inexplicable, pretentious, boring, thought-provoking, and existential  whatever your reaction, you wouldn't be wrong.",A Ghost Story
12,deloudelouvain,By far in my top three of worst movies I ever saw,1,19 October 2017,"Amazing! Wonderful! Incredible! Those could be the words describing this movie. I just forgot a couple words with it, that's all. Let me rectify my mistake. Amazingly boring! Wonderfully pretentious! Incredibly overrated! So that's better, that being rectified. Honestly it's one of the worst movies I ever saw in my life. And I have see tons. You couldn't even spoil this movie by telling you about it because there is just nothing to spoil. Nothing happens during the entire movie. And all action shots, yes I know it sounds ridiculous when I say action shots, are way too long. Guy is dead and laying on a stretcher, let's film that for a couple minutes. Girl is eating her cake while guy with sheet is looking at her, let's film that for ten minutes. And even that the actress couldn't do it right, never saw a woman eat in such a vulgar way. Guy with sheet standing in the room while watching some boring stuff, let's film that for about the entire movie. There is almost no dialogues so if you get bored just listen to some music in the meanwhile, or even better just don't watch this piece of crap. I've been looking the whole time how much longer I had to endure this total mess. At one point there was like twenty minutes left and the only thing I could think about was that I hoped there would be nineteen minutes of end credits. Honestly I can't understand why this piece of garbage gets such a high rating on here. At least I'm not the only one that thinks this movie is truly awful. Avoid at all costs!",A Ghost Story
13,namashi_1,A Haunting Tale!,10,23 September 2017,"Written & Directed by David Lowery, 'A Ghost Story' is a film that left me spell-bound. Though a Supernatural Drama, 'A Ghost Story' is more a love-story & captures the essence of Life & Death. A film like this can't be made without ambition & passion, but Lowery is at his peak on both sides.'A Ghost Story' Synopsis: In this singular exploration of legacy, love, loss, and the enormity of existence, a recently deceased, white-sheeted ghost returns to his suburban home to try to reconnect with his bereft wife.'A Ghost Story' may come across as a slow-paced slog or a pointless piece of cinematic waste for some, but I pity those who'd feel like that. 'A Ghost Story' is a film made with such heart & Written with such vigor, it would only leave a heartless soul complaining. There is NOT a single moment in this film that bores or is forced, its all done seamlessly & makes you feel the pain, of the dead & of the one alive. Its core emotion, made with a crumbled heart. 'A Ghost Story' is truly an exploration of legacy, love, loss, and the enormity of existence. Lowery is at the top of his game. 'A Ghost Story' makes us sit up & realize that Lowery is one storyteller we need to watch out for in the coming time. His Screenplay is pure emotion & portrays life & death with gut-wrenching honesty. And did I say that the culmination to this story is a piece of sheer mastery itself? Lowery's Writing is super-strong! His Direction, on the other-hand, is subtle, but powerful. Lowery has also Edited the film & he excels in this department as well. Andrew Droz Palermo's Cinematography captures the claustrophobic vibe, with astonishing detailing. Art & Costume Design are perfect. Daniel Hart's Score is beautiful.Performance-Wise: Oscar-Winner Casey Affleck & Oscar-Nominee Rooney Mara do some of their best work here. Affleck is excellent who is mostly covered over a grieving sheet all over him, but portrays his part with complete conviction. Mara, as his widowed wife, is searingly beautiful. Her performance is the emotional core of the film. What an actress! Will Oldham, in a one-scene cameo, leaves a strong mark.On the whole, 'A Ghost Story' is a MASTERPIECE.

Casey Affleck(Oscar winner)is C and his love M(Rooney Mara) live a quite life together with love and passion, until one day it's turned upside down when C apparently dies in a freak car accident. Then his spirit and soul takes over in the form of a white sheet type ghost who follows and travels to look at people and life from a distance without speaking or letting people see him. Really this film is a showcase to see what life is like when one is gone as it's a different take and twist seeing the life of other people you know and see the reaction of them when your not around.

15,lasttimeisaw,Taking the uncanny to a cosmic level within an economical conceit,7,1 October 2017,"Taking the uncanny to a cosmic level within an economical conceit, US filmmaker David Lowery's fourth feature A GHOST STORY reunites his two stars from AIN'T THEM BODIES SAINTS (2013), Casey Affleck and Rooney Mara, who play a couple separated by mortality when the husband dies in a car accident. He subsequently returns in their suburban domicile as a ghost covered in a white sheet with two black holes pinch-hitting for his unfathomable eyes, to watch his wife's grief process and the following transcendence. Boxed up in the standard-definition television aspect ratio (4:3) the film presents itself as an intimate, navel-gazing slow cinema hopeful in its first half, as we are privileged to watch Mara wolfing down a pie for a good 4 minutes before nausea prompting her to spew. A visceral but cookie-cutter signpost of what one will do when she/he is bereaved. But please rest assured that things are going upward henceforth, the film's viewpoint is unerringly set in the ghost's motionless gaze, invisible to the mortals around him, he is pigeonholed in a perpetual ""waiting"" presence by the aftermath (choosing to stay on earth in lieu of going with the light to another realm, bang-up special effects are implemented with astute ingenuity sporadically), but what is he waiting for? In the midstream, he notices there is another ghost like him in the neighbor house, and through their gnomic communication, the latter tells him that he is waiting for someone he can no longer remember. When his wife finally leaves and starts her new life somewhere else, the ghost remains in situ, and expresses his frustration when new tenants move in, so before long the place becomes a haunted house and is expected to be bulldozed along with the one thing the ghost cares, a paper note left by his wife in the interstice of the wall, which he has yet to obtain (it is very difficult for fingers to poke under a sheet, honestly). As if to compensate the laconic narrative hitherto, just before the annihilation, Lowery introduces a jabbering Will Oldham to hold forth about the conception of human's endeavor of preserving our legacy, which becomes no less befuddling and cringe-worthy than the pie-eating sequence: the gist is blasé and the posture is pontifical. Afterwards, the ghost maintains his locus through its topographic transformation into a skyscraper, when he finally gives up his oceanic waiting, a seismic change brings him back to the jumping-off place in the 19th century, when the place is first touched by the hand of a modern civilization. He again waits, for centuries until he watches himself and his wife move into the house, and latches onto that he is incapable of altering their preordained kismet (only resulting more ghosts), when he finally snatches that note and reads its content, he vanishes under the sheet. ""Whatever hour you wake there was a door shutting"" from Virginia Woolf's A HAUNTED HOUSE, is the preamble Lowery leaves in the open, and as a reverential experiment trying to enlighten us with something elemental about a para-psychological universe, the film is at large worth its salt in spite of its artistic pretension and what categorically leaves an indelible savor is Daniel Hart's eerie, lamenting string score and Lowery's canny sense of cinematic composition.",A Ghost Story
16,Hellmant,"Extremely fascinating, and well made.",9,17 August 2017,"'A GHOST STORY': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) A low-budget supernatural drama about a newly deceased man who remains in his house with his wife, as a ghost (covered in a white sheet with two black holes for eyes). The movie stars Casey Affleck and Rooney Mara. It was written and directed by David Lowery, who previously helmed the critically acclaimed 2013 indie hit 'AIN'T THEM BODIES SAINTS' (also starring Affleck and Mara). It was made on a budget remarkably just of $100,000, and it's received nearly unanimous positive reviews from critics. I found it to be extremely fascinating, and well made.C (Affleck) is an aspiring musician that lives with his wife, M (Mara), in a quiet suburban house. C dies in a car accident, and then he awakens as a ghost, in the hospital (covered in a sheet with two black holes for eyes), which no one living can see. Instead of passing through a door of light (apparently leading to an afterlife), he returns home to his wife (Mara). He then continues to obsessively watch her, as M tries to get over his death and move on.The movie is quite amazing for a $100,000 budget, but I think it's a classic supernatural tale regardless (and I've never seen anything quite like it). The film takes all of the classic ghost film/story clichés but it uses them to make an insightful, seemingly realistic, tale about what it would be like to actually be a ghost; and also what it would be like for the living people you effect. It's somewhat slow-paced, but I found it to be very involving (and always uniquely interesting). It's definitely an impressive filmmaking accomplishment.Watch an episode of our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://vimeo.com/230044658",A Ghost Story
17,MOscarbradley,A langourous meditation on life after death.,9,22 December 2018,"Aficianados of the horror movie will hate ""A Ghost Story"" for this tale of a lonely ghost moves at a snails pace, (writer/director David Lowery isn't built for speed). A little like Anthony Mingella's ""Truly Madly Deeply"" before it, it's about grief and loss and not letting go. Early in the film the character played by Casey Affleck is killed off, only to return as a ghost, rising from his mortuary slab under a large white sheet with holes for eyes like someone playing at being a ghost on Halloween. He spends the rest of this virtually silent film searching, though I'm not sure he quite knows what he's searching for.Nothing very much happens and when any of the tropes of the horror movie do raise their head they are quickly dismissed and forgotten. In the films most memorable scene he simply stands and watches his grieving widow, (Rooney Mara), as she sits and eats a very large pie. In a conventional horror film he would fly across the room to terrify her and us but here it's she who races from the room to throw up.There's little dialogue and no real action yet the film is incredibly moving; ghosts, it seems, are everywhere, waiting for something or someone that may or may not come. Death, like life, holds its disappointments. This is not a movie for everyone but if you're in the mood for a languorous, ruminative meditation on life after death it's certainly the film for you.",A Ghost Story
18,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"It may be painfully slow by design, but it's still painfully slow.",5,12 April 2018,"'A Ghost Story (2017)' takes a while to digest. Even after some reflection, though, it still feels like a pretty pointless affair, purporting to be profound when in reality it occasionally seems somewhat pretentious. It's honestly one of the most boring cinematic experiences of the year for two thirds of its runtime, with an excruciatingly slow pace that extends itself to two individual sequences that almost provoke pain due to their incessant length (the pie eating scene being the worst offender). It's annoying because I can see what they were going for, even when the action slows to less than a crawl, and the film's final act picks up the pace to a point where it introduces some interesting ideas and ends on a surprisingly affecting note. I can't deny that the unnecessary monotony really makes the experience a long and tedious one, though. I mean, five whole minutes to eat a pie, in a medium in which an extra few seconds can kill a shot, really is taking the cake. The soundtrack is phenomenal, though, almost redeeming some of the less eventful sequences.",A Ghost Story
19,dromasca,the boring life of ghosts,4,16 January 2018,"I am seldom asking such questions, but now I need to ask it. 'Why did they do this film?'. Seriously. A film may made because the director or the script writer have one or more messages to transmit. In some other cases the message is not that important, and the goal is to entertain. Films have target audiences that go to see it because of the message or because they want to be entertained. Of course, there are better films and not so good films. In the case of David Lowery's A Ghost Story I can appreciate some moments of good cinema. And yet, I did not get any message and I was deeply bored. Life of ghosts is probably boring, this is what I understood from this film. But why should film audiences be bored also, some of them after paying money for the film tickets? So, please, somebody who understood the messages that I missed, and/or was entertained by this film, please, be kind and help me!A young couple, C for Casey Affleck and M for Rooney Mara live in a country house. He is a musician, she uses to leave hidden messages in places she lives. He dies suddenly in an accident and has to cope with grieving and continuing to live. He turns into a ghost, with a blanket and two holes (for eyes? we never see them) who watches her, the house, the life that goes on, time. I will stop telling more in order to avoid spoiling whatever pleasure one may get from watching this film. I could understand the feelings. I could relate to what the characters are feeling. But I never understood whether the director really wanted us (viewers) to resonate or just played a big joke. It just did not make sense.There is a game with time that the script is playing with the viewers. I will again avoid spoilers and say no more that time happens differently to ghosts than to humans which is something quite obvious. At some point in time, in a rather unrelated scene a supporting character makes a party drunk speech about Beethoven and the cosmic cycles of the Universe. Are we supposed to understand that we all (human and ghosts) live some smaller cycles within the Big Cycle? Maybe.Casey Affleck and Rooney Mara are fine actors, but they did not help too much in this film. The ghost blanket looks kind of funny, maybe it was supposed to provide the comic counterpoint, actually there are a few more, including a she-ghost in a neighboring house. Cinematography is good, but the overall slowness of the camera movements make feel the about 80 minutes like three hours. Overall it's a pretentious, boring and confusing experience.",A Ghost Story
20,gbill-74877,A different kind of ghost story,7,28 August 2021,"A quiet ghost story that isn't about horror or drama, instead focusing on themes of loss and transience. A man unexpectedly passes away (Casey Affleck) but returns to haunt his partner (Rooney Mara), at least initially. ""Haunt"" is a strong word because he sort of just floats around her and she never feels his presence, even when he's angered because she moves on.Early on I was turned off by the film's very slow pace (that pie eating scene, good lord) and the literal bedsheet that Affleck wears to affect being a ghost. The film seemed to be going down a familiar path, and not only slowly but with cheesy costuming. When the ghost spots another in the next house over and after waving at him communicates telepathically, I groaned. Later on, the film earned another demerit by showing a family of white pioneers killed by Native Americans, that tired old (and damn misleading) trope.With that said, the film goes to some interesting places, and I appreciated it for not just being a standard ghost story. At a party the ghost watches over, a man (Will Oldham) gives a lengthy monologue of his existential views of man's transience and the ultimate meaninglessness of it all. While it's a bit direct, it stood out because most of the other dialogue is in snippets, and it framed most of what the film was trying to say quite well. The ghost seems like a lonely, doomed soul, condemned to seeing people buzzing through their lives almost like insects, and the landscape changing over the long arc of time. Clinging to such a world when nothing can ever be permanent is foolish; accepting the love that one had and knowing when to let go the only solution. As a last note, and a bit of an aside, the George Saunders book 'Lincoln in the Bardo,' also from 2017, explores some of these themes as well, and it's one that I'd recommend.",A Ghost Story

But when she moves out he discovers he is bound to the house and its subsequent tenants. When the land is sold to developers, C haunts the office building built on the property. In fact his connection to the estate goes beyond time itself.A measured meditation on matter, marriage and what motivates an apparition to haunt, this artistic take on the afterlife feels like an authentic one.

I haven't read or heard anything about this movie before watching it, and this is why this movie has surprised me in a positive way. ""A Ghost Story"" isn't like anything i have seen from Hollywood in many moons - its hard to imagine that this movie was even made in the same universe were superheroes wearing spandex are dominating the industry. ""A Ghost Story"" was like a breath of fresh air.There are some true amazing scenes in this movie, which i will hardly to forget. Yet there were also scenes which i think this movie would be better without it - like a pie scene which was not necessary in my opinion. Yet the movie made me think - about life and time, and this is what is currently missing in a movies i think.Overall, ""A Ghost Story"" is a unique movie in many ways. Its story and the way it was presented - some will like it some will not. I liked very much, and while it could have been even better without some unnecessary elements, this movie felt like a good breath of fresh air. Very good movie if you ask me.",A Ghost Story
24,Reno-Rangan,A love story from another dimension!,7,4 January 2018,"I did not think what the title says was literal. I assumed some person with social-shy, wore a white cloth like a mask to confront it. Totally surprised by what I saw. Frankly, I did not like at the first. It was a boring start. I could not overcome that pie eating scene. It was damn too long for nothing. That kinds are the source of boredom. But the actress did good on that. Then what followed were amazing. I truly was not expected that. So at the end, I thought it was an average, then thought a decent and finally realised its something unique and awesome. The lesson is, the more time you give between watching the film and your opinion, the result would only get better.Well the story was so simple. A couple with their average life get affected when one of them dies in a car accident. Soon the ghost resides the house looking for a reason to stay. It is kind of a love story from another dimension. As the time passes on, things change and complicates the quest. But there's always a way to fix it, even for a ghost, so how its been done and what it is was the remaining story.The cast was good, but most of the film it was about the ghost, which could have been anybody inside the sheet. So can't appreciate particularly anyone. As I have heard, Casey did all those parts as he should be. Even though that was not a praisable performance than a simple presence. It's his second collaboration with the director along with Rooney Mara. The one question that everybody who saw it needed to be answered is what was the note says. I googled and got the Q&A with the director that says, nobody knows, not even Mara remembers what she wrote.This is one of the best films. With or without reason the story happened. But that's not the matter, instead, how cleverly, such a concept was developed and made into a film makes the interesting fact. They even did not require a higher end graphics, except in small quantity. It will gain a cult status and as the years go by, it will be considered one of best 1,000 films. So recommend it, but be patient, at least in the initial stage and take a day to give an opinion on it. Maybe reading articles about the plot if you have a doubt is good.

25,paulclaassen,A Movie experience!,7,10 June 2018,"Oh, wow, I'm so glad I decided to watch this film. The cinematography is exquisite, with wide angle shots. Even the rooms are spacious and open, as if depicting emptiness - the kind of emptiness one feels having lost a loved one. The film has a lot of quiet moments, yet it works so incredibly well. There's a 5-minute scene of the wife just sitting eating a pie while the ghost stands watching her motionless. It was so effective! Some seemingly insignificant scenes meant so much, especially from a loving couple's perspective. The scene where the wife sits listening to her husband's song was especially powerful.This is a uniquely different film. It is a beautifully, amazingly well shot film. It was so effectively portrayed how time is irrelevant to the ghost. The film spans decades, although to the ghost it must seem like days. It was so sad, actually, but insanely well done. There's hardly any dialogue in the entire film, and then one guy comes along and makes up for lost dialogue, but it was interesting and oh-so-relevant. This is not just a movie; it is a movie experience!",A Ghost Story
26,tomgillespie2002,Chilling and oddly beautiful,9,2 December 2017,"The premise of David Lowery's A Ghost Story is very simple indeed. A man (played by Casey Affleck) dies in a car crash, only for his spirit to remain in the land of the living to watch over his grieving widow (played by Rooney Mara). He stays with her in the home they made together - a home, we will come to learn, that she wanted to leave, despite his wish to remain in the quiet, isolated area he felt so comfortable in. It sounds like the stuff of emotionally manipulative Hollywood schmaltz, but Lowery's interests stretch much, much further than themes of sorrow and the search for closure. It reaches way into the cosmos, seeking to understand our place in the universe and within the infinity of time itself.One of the most striking aspects of A Ghost Story is the appearance of the ghost itself. Draped in a white sheet complete with cut-out eye holes, Affleck drifts through the film with slow steps, longing stares and brief fits of rage. As his lifeless body lies on the mortuary table, the camera lingers for what seems like an eternity, as we wait for the jump-shock that horror movies have taught us to expect. However, when he sits up slowly, sheet still draped over his face, and begins to study his surroundings like a lost animal, the effect is miraculous. It's certainly chilling, but also oddly beautiful. I don't know if much thought went into the design and weight of the white sheet, but Affleck manages to express himself astonishingly well without the benefit of being visible. Things start to get weirder and more ambitious as Mara's character moves out of the house to move on with her life.We witness the passing of time from the ghost's perspective. In the blink of an eye, a Hispanic family has moved in. This enrages him, and the family experience poltergeist activity. Then, some party- goers inhabit the house, before it is eventually knocked down and replaced by office buildings. Still the ghost stalks the corridors waiting for... something, occasionally conversing with the ghost next door. Time passes like half-remembered memories, and we eventually come full circle. Made quickly and cheaply shortly after post-production for Pete's Dragon had been completed and reuniting Lowery with his Ain't Them Bodies Saints stars, the slow and deliberate pace of A Ghost Story will likely put many viewers off, especially those seeking out a traditional spook tale. But patience is a virtue, and the effects are long-standing, resonating far deeper than most movies could ever dream of.",A Ghost Story
27,eddie_baggins,A unique take on grief and loss,7,22 April 2018,"That A Ghost Story work's at all is a huge feat by itself.A film in which its lead male star spends 90% of the films runtime under a white sheet, silently wandering his old home as he watches his grieving wife live her life without him, doesn't exactly seem like the type of film that would offer a raw and often affecting examination of life, death and the journey we all take but David Lowery's low-budget affair is one of 2017's most curious films, even if its effect on viewers will differ wildly depending on their connection to this far from generic tale.After impressing with the one-two double hit of the well-received indie Ain't Them Bodies Saints and the fantastic Disney remake Pete's Dragon, Lowery enlisted the help of his Bodies stars Mara and Affleck for this film that was shot in secret with little fanfare but A Ghost Story feels like a well-polished and thoughtful affair that clearly holds a personal resonance with the up and coming filmmaker.We never get much background on Mara or Affleck, a couple who have clearly been through their ups and downs but we still feel the heartbreak and hurt Mara suffers after Affleck is killed off early in the film, only to return as an unseen (yet sometimes felt) ghostly presence in a blanket.The early stages of A Ghost Story are almost devoid of dialogue as Affleck watches on, time operating on a different level as Mara slowly but surely begins to move on from her broken heart. Lowery in no rush to get anywhere fast (a scene of Mara eating a pie is one of last years longest scenes, but for good reason and intent) but filmed beautifully by DOP Andrew Droz Palermo and scored thoughtfully by composer Daniel Hart, you won't mind that A Ghost Story takes its time to transpire.While the set-up of the film is strong and captivating in an ethereal type way, A Ghost Story does struggle as its journey begins to become something else entirely. Around the mid-way point Mara mostly exits the picture, as we instead focus solely on Affleck's bedsheet clad ghost and the film takes turns into unexpected areas that don't always work.It's an ambitious move by Lowery and some will love it but for anyone that disapproved of narrative detours like the beginning of Earth segments of The Tree of Life would do well to avoid Lowery's slow moving affair all together.Final Say - Lowery continues to be a filmmaker of considerable skill, anchored by another hugely impressive Rooney Mara turn and a different type of Casey Affleck performance, A Ghost Story is a quietly powerful and unique experience that should be sought out by anyone seeking something out of the ordinary, even if some of the places Lowery takes us to don't always resonate.3 ½ emotional eating scenes out of 5",A Ghost Story
28,howard.schumann,"A gentle mood of sadness, longing, and loss",8,7 August 2017,"Though the consensus of mainstream science is that ghosts do not exist, people's shared experiences throughout history tell us that disembodied spirits do wander the earth, unfortunate souls who are unable to let go of their attachments to the earthly world they just left. David Lowery's (""Pete's Dragon"") touching meditation on life, love, and impermanence, A Ghost Story, sees life not from the usual perspective of the one left behind after a loved one dies, but from the vantage point of the dead, the ghost who remains attached to the physical world, looking for completion and release. A Ghost Story has little dialogue or plot, and the experience of passion and regret only comes through in a very limited way, yet a gentle mood of sadness, longing, and loss permeates the film and gives it its character.In the film which is shot in a 1:33:1 ratio, a format that creates the experience of living inside a box (the way many of us do), Rooney Mara (""Song to Song"") and Casey Affleck (""Manchester by the Sea""), known as M and C, live together in a single-story house in suburban Texas, an ordinary house without many distinguishing characteristics. It takes its meaning in the film from the memories it holds of families and friends, of children decorating a Christmas tree, of the tinkling sound of a piano and the whispering of birds in the early morning, a panoply of life and love. As M and C proclaim their love and talk about their future plans, the idyllic scene is brutally interrupted when C is killed in a car accident and his body, covered by a sheet, is identified by M at the morgue.C's body, clothed only in a sheet that completely covers his body with two holes carved out for his eyes, rises from the slab and calmly walks out of the room, heading back across fields to the house with which he is familiar. Mara, devastated and alone, has no one to turn to communicate with and, in one memorable scene, expresses her grief by eating an entire pie in one take that lasts more than five minutes, an event that can try the patience of even the biggest devotee of art cinema. As the expressionless ghost wanders around the house, the film becomes silent except for the exquisite score by Daniel Hart (""Ain't Them Bodies Saints""). At one point, the ghost sees a fellow traveler wearing a sheet with a floral pattern in a window across the street.Since we don't know how ghosts communicate and apparently texting is not available, Lowery provides subtitles of what is being said, which is not much. They don't talk about the weather or how terrible humans are. One ghost simply says that she is waiting but doesn't remember who she is waiting for. We know that there is a note hidden by M in a crack in the wall which the ghost works at retrieving, but finding the note is only one reason the ghost hangs around. He wants to be there for her even though he knows she is going to move on. When M does move out, the ghost remains attached to the house, traveling into the future to haunt a future resident, a Hispanic single mother (Sonia Acevedo) and her two children (Carlos Bermudez and Yasmina Gutierrez) who are enjoying life until big G, upset with their intrusion, does his poltergeist thing, throwing dishes around and causing both general and specific chaos.Remorseful, the ghost returns to the distant past when a family who populated the site when it was nothing but grassland ends up with arrows stuck in their ribs, courtesy of the local Indians. A modern office building, also in the future, is his final destination, but, not feeling too happy there, he jumps out of a window from high above the street, but has as much success killing himself as did Bill Murray in ""Groundhog Day."" At some point, the ghost attends a party dominated by an inebriated philosopher (Will Oldham, ""Pioneer"") who thinks he has something very profound to say and morosely delivers a lecture on the idea that nothing lasts and that even the Earth will die as well as perhaps the entire universe.Lowery has said that ""while he (Oldham) is basically saying, ""Live each day like it's your last,"" he wants people to come away from the movie feeling like there's a little more to life than just that. I would suggest that there's a great deal more. In fact, the speech misses the point of impermanence and non-attachment. To live in non-attachment means that we recognize there was never anything to attach or cling to in the first place, that our separation from others is an Earth-bound illusion and that we are always connected to all things at all times, an experience that leads to joy rather than despair.Yes, the swift passage of time can be scary and things do fall apart but, as the poet Rilke says, ""This hand falls, nor yet this other. Falling all enfoldeth. Yet is there one who all this falling holdeth with unending gentleness?"" Even ghosts must eventually let go.",A Ghost Story
29,TheMovieDiorama,A Ghost Story is a thematic contemporary minimalistic piece of cinema that will not appeal to many people.,8,2 March 2018,"Straight away there were people leaving the cinema or sniggering at the concept. It might sound like a horror film, it is not. Do not watch this expecting jump scares...although, funnily, there were one or two. This is an extremely heavy story that explores deep themes including existentialism, legacy and the passage of time. A couple reside peacefully in a small house until one of them is killed in a car accident and returns in a ghostly form. The ghost is presented simply as a man under some bed sheets with some eyes cut out. Minimalistic. The dialogue is sparse to enhance the visual narration of the story. Minimalistic. The camera, for many scenes, will not move for a good 5 minutes. Minimalistic. The majority of the film takes place in one house. Minimalistic. Ok fine, you get the idea. Director David Lowery did not require a massive budget to convey the idea of time. That's the beauty of this! The purpose is to interrogate the question of: ""who suffers the most pain, the widow as they mourn or the ghost that observes them moving on?"". An absolutely fascinating premise. Seemingly trapped in the afterlife in what I can only describe as a time loop, the ghost not just observes their widow moving on, but other generations after. An imprisonment fuelled by sorrow. The ghost cannot communicate verbally and yet somehow I felt their pain through the limp and slow movement which made the whole film melancholic. The genius move to have the camera in a 4:3 aspect ratio in order to enhance the idea of being trapped. There were times though that I found Lowery slightly borderline pretentious. A 3 minute take of Mara and Affleck in bed was too slow for its own good. In contrast, Mara eating a pie for a 5 minute take was far more gratifying to watch. I did also find that a scene where a guy talks about legacy and existence just ruined the subtlety that the narrative was clearly trying to convey. Deeply thematic, but borderline pretentious.",A Ghost Story

31,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Ambitious artistic cinema that will challenge audiences but has enough raw human truth to connect to them,9,21 December 2017,"Films that seem to make time stop or get us to consider how the small thread that is our lives fits into the massive tapestry of the universe are rare. Their artistic ambition usually leads to divisiveness among audiences, like an abstract painting that confounds one person but strikes a nerve in the next. ""A Ghost Story"" fits neatly into that category, the first film to do so on this level since Terrence Malick's 2011 film ""The Tree of Life."" Many film critics and scholars hold up that film as one of the few masterpieces of the 21st century thus far, but audiences have hardly felt the same.The degree of access to David Lowery's (""Ain't Them Bodies Saints"" - also starring Rooney Mara and Casey Affleck) latest film is noticeably higher than ""Tree of Life"" thanks to a clear-cut if not unusual premise: A young husband and musician (Affleck) dies unexpectedly, becoming a ghost in a white sheet who haunts his house even after his wife (Mara) moves out. What starts as a reflection on love and loss evolves into meditation on legacy and the fragility of life.The most immediately noticeable aspect of Lowery's approach to this story is his manipulation of time. The first half of the movie is a portrait of the couple's relationship and what the ghost observes in the aftermath of his death while his wife still lives in the house. Parts of this section absolutely plod and interminably linger. Lowery tests our patience by deliberately throwing off the expected rhythm and timing of scenes and shots, expectations that have become so engrained in the average viewer that we forget we have them. A scene in which Mara's character eats pie for what feels like centuries will immediately lose viewers not feeling moved enough to take this existential deep dive with Lowery.Then there are sequences in which Lowery has the passing of time sneak up and take us by surprise. The maddening nature of this exercise in ""time management,"" however, beautifully echoes the way our brains actually experience time. Moments of profound grief and sadness can feel like an eternity, and at other times we blink and everything changes.Fast or slow, Lowery frames and edits every shot like it matters, creating stunning portraits and almost ethereal transitions. The shots also have to balance multiple perspectives, namely how the viewer sees the ghost and what's going on in the house, and also how the ghost sees everything going on in the house. There's a pervasive loneliness and isolation (and consequently empathy) for the ghost, but whatever he's observing also has its own energy. The ghost's ability to ""haunt,"" or impact the physical world when he becomes emotional, creates powerful, unexpected breaks in that continuity that make the story more interesting.Although much of ""A Ghost Story"" is rooted in human emotion, at a certain point it takes off on a philosophical journey that explores purpose and legacy. Lowery's greatest achievement in the telling of this story (among those who take his hand and embrace the spiritual journey) is the way we connect so fiercely to the ghost's emotional turmoil without that character saying a single word (except telepathically to a neighboring ghost, but that's beside the point). That's ""Exhibit A"" for Lowery's success with this film - you've hit something universal when dialogue does not drive the story.Although ""A Ghost Story"" doesn't come close to counting as a horror film, Lowery does play with actual ghost story elements, evoking suspense and fear at a few key points, but these are the traditional ""suspense"" and ""fear"" we usually talk about when talking about movies. They're born out of something instinctively human. You could walk in on ""A Ghost Story"" at a few points throughout the runtime and think you're watching a horror film, however - that's how beautifully Lowery has weaved human truth into the film. In a way, Lowery's ""ghost in a sheet"" approach is a way of asking us to look beyond our superficial understanding of ghosts and the usual preoccupation we have with the supernatural and actually consider the humanity of ghosts if in fact they were real - people who once had lives and are struggling to make peace with how they were lived.Like most ambitious films, ""A Ghost Story"" does not apologize for its experimental nature and begs the viewer to completely recalibrate in order to come into step with it, but there's also a lot or raw, unfiltered truth and emotion that should latch on to even those wariest of recalibrating.~Steven CThanks for reading!

32,paul-allaer,Wanna-be important movie about love and grief simply misses the mark,5,30 July 2017,"""A Ghost Story"" (2017 release; 92 min.) brings the story of a couple, whom we only get to know as C (they guy) and M (the woman. As the movie opens, we get to know them as they snuggle on the couch, discuss things, and live their lives. But it's not long before C dies in a head-on car crash. M visits his body in the morgue one last time. After she leaves, we see C come alive as a ghost, walking around covered in a sheet with 2 holes for his eyes. He watches M grieve. At this point we're 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is a labor of love for writer-director David Lowery, who rose to prominence with the Disney movie ""Pete's Dragon""> Here he goes a complete different direction, bringing us a poem (in film) of what love and grief is all about. There are several remarkable things about this movie: quite a few of the scenes are shot from a single angle and in one long uninterrupted take (check out the scene where Mara eats a pie in the kitchen). Then there is the unusual picture aspect ration of 1:33 to 1, like you are (literally) boxed in. Casey Affleck (as C) and Rooney Mara (as M) have curious roles. For one, Affleck is hidden under the ghost sheet for much of the movie. Mara is shown as grieving but looks to me more as being utterly depressed (which is not the same). As the movie progresses, I couldn't help but wonder why the ghost is attached more to the house than to his surviving wife. Even more bewildering is that the ghost discovers there is a ghost living in the next door house, and they strike up a (silent) conversation, ""Who are you waiting for?"" he asks. ""I don't remember"" the other ghost responds. Huh? And while I certainly won't spoil the end, all I will say is that I found it equally bewildering and frustrating. I typically love a non-conventional movie but in this instance I simply could not get the hang of this one.""A Ghost Story"" premiered to critical acclaim at this year's Sundance Film Festival. It finally opened this weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati on not one, but two screens (a rarity), and I couldn't wait to see it. The Saturday early evening screening where I saw this at was attended poorly (5 people, including myself). I could be totally off the mark, but honestly cannot see this movie having long legs at the box office. For that it is too abstract and too off-putting, and in that sense the complete opposite of the similarly themed 1990 smash hit ""Ghost"" starring Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore.",A Ghost Story
33,jtindahouse,A unique and powerful film that won't be for everyone,6,2 June 2018,"I'm not sure I entirely understand what 'A Ghost Story's message was. I'm not sure I'm even supposed to. I understand what it meant to me and I think it's supposed to be unique to everyone in that sense. I could relate to the movie heavily because I've always felt strong connections to each house I've lived in, and also the people I've lived in them with. The film really connected with me in that way. This is a beautiful film in a lot of ways, but it's also a very grim and bleak watch when you really stop and think about it. To say this film is unique would be an understatement. I can't remember seeing anything remotely like it. It's also fair to say this won't be a film to everyone's liking. At times even I didn't like it. There are some long drawn out scenes that may test people who aren't fully invested' patience. And there are people who I'm sure the concept will simply not register with at all. I lie somewhere in the middle. It's not a film I will ever watch again, but I'm certainly glad I saw it once and could resonate with it. Anything this original is worth a look in this day and age.",A Ghost Story
34,billcr12,Wandering Ghost,3,20 September 2017,"I watched this ponderous mess based on the 7.7 rating on IMDb. RT also has an 80% rating. I must have seen a different movie. Casey Affleck spends most of the film wandering around wearing a bed sheet with holes cut out for eyes; trick or treat. His wife, Rooney Mara and he mumble a few incoherent lines at each other and the camera lingers for long stretches for no apparent reason. The non linear story line is maddening. At one point, Affleck comes upon a family in a covered wagon. It quickly flashes back to his modern house. He sometimes waves at a ghost next door. Rooney's big moment comes as she sits on the kitchen floor consuming an entire pie. Stay away from this snooze fest, unless you are suffering from insomnia.",A Ghost Story

36,kirbylee70-599-526179,Competition for Sominex,1,23 October 2017,"Let me start off by saying that if you see a movie named A GHOST STORY released to DVD in the beginning of October the odds are you're thinking this would be a good movie for Halloween, right? Well this movie is far from that. Yes, it involves a ghost, but that's as close as it gets to Halloween. And since it was released to theaters before October it may just be a coincidence. Just be aware that this is not a good Halloween movie. As a matter of fact it's not much of a good movie either.The film opens with Casey Affleck as C and Rooney Mara as M, a young couple in love and about to move from a house they live in. Lying together on the couch she tells him about when she was a little girl, how she would take notes to herself and fold them into the tightest, smallest way she could and then insert them into the crevices of the house she was leaving. Moving a lot as a child her intent was to have something there to remind herself of those times if she ever returned.One of the odd things the film does is nor move in a linear fashion but just jumps forward to key scenes. One key scene involves the couple in bed when they hear a crash against their piano in the other room. Investigating they find nothing disturbed and go back to bed. There they cuddle and kiss for what seems like an eternity and then go back to sleep. Next key scene, C plays a piece of music he's composed for M to listen to. Next key scene M hauls a trunk to the curb. Next key scene C is in a car crash outside their home.The following scene moves the reset of the movie forward. M views the body of C in the morgue and then leaves. A lingering shot that seems like forever just shows the sheet covered body lying there. And then it rises. This images moves the rest of the movie forward, a sheet covered ghost. Returning to the home it watches M deal with her loss and move out. It watches new people move in and scares one family. It watches another move in which sets up the next biggest portion of the film.I could describe it but this part is the most interesting part of the entire film and while taking time to make a point via dialogue it's only a small portion of the time spent watching this film. And trust me you'll be noticing the time while watching as it seems to take forever to go anywhere.While watching this film one word kept floating through my brain: pretentious. The definition of the word is ""attempting to impress by affecting greater importance, talent, culture, etc., than is actually possessed."" That sums up this movie perfectly. In attempting to make ""art"" the film instead induces boredom. If I were Sominex I would try and buy the rights to this film as it induces sleep faster than that over the country drug.Long shots of nothing, panning shots of scenes with nothing going on and the latest fad in pretentious films, the long drawn out gaze of one actor either at another or just at the camera, all are found here. Affleck took some heat for some with his previous film MANCHESTER BY THE SEA where some found it to be pretentious as well. I enjoyed his performance there and still recommend the film. But this film is nothing more than art house self-pat on the back type film making, a movie where those involved tell themselves how wonderful it is and how the masses just aren't smart enough to understand the complexities of art.In reality the masses are quite aware of what art is. They know what is good and what is bad. And to use a portion of a well turned phrase they'll also see this movie and realize immediately that it is not Shinola but the alternative.",A Ghost Story

41,Agent10,Beautiful and slow rendition of life and death,7,22 August 2021,"Religions from around the world often believe in the afterlife, for a paradise awaits those who are the true and faithful believers of said religion. In many religions as well, there is often a spoken trope of purgatory, where someone is trapped in a loop and cannot get out.Dante described purgatory as a rather low key and constricted place, and many religions describe this area of static spiritual movement as a stoppage. However, what if it is just a loop? David Lowery takes this idea in a very strange and basic way, taking influences from Spirited Away and possibly from Gaspar Noe's Enter the Void. We enter this life, we leave it, and then we are destined to travel the afterlife with no meaning or clarity or even memory. It's a brutal idea to behold when you think about it. So many hold onto the idea of paradise after they die that they forget about the other possibilities. But more importantly, they forget that such beliefs are beholden to the individual.I think this is what makes this film so interesting. Every scene has some hidden meaning that can be taken differently by a wide swath of people. And if anything, is there a wrong answer. Interesting movie to say the least.",A Ghost Story

43,framptonhollis,the humanity and tragedy of existentialism,9,11 January 2018,"Open ended, mysterious, mind bending, ""A Ghost Story"" is all these things and so much more.  Few films of such insightful intellect have been released recently, which is probably why ""A Ghost Story"" feels so refreshing. Many people hate it, of course, as it is one of the most inaccessible American movies I have seen that isn't a directly experimental piece. It is deliberately slow in parts (the five minute long pie eating sequence has already become somewhat infamous, and I'll admit that my mind was wandering around during that sequence plenty, but it felt as if it were intended to be that way as far as I can tell), and it will definitely come across as a total ""hipster"" movie to most of those who watch it without any prior knowledge, and to an extent they may be right. But there's something about this film that is so much more sincere and touching about ""A Ghost Story"" than there is to any of those other movies. ""A Ghost Story"" may be totally inaccessible, but it is still a film that focuses on themes of a universal nature, and does so in an elegant, artistic, emotional, and, most importantly, HUMANE manner that is philosophically troubling and evocative.  Other than the deep, dark themes of existentialist dread and possible hope, ""A Ghost Story"" succeeds on every front of the filmmaking process. Casey Affleck is standing and walking around under the sheet for most of the movie, and his performance is still amazing. He doesn't even have more than what seems like at most 2 1/2 minutes of actual dialogue, and yet he is able to communicate so much through body language. Even the speed and characteristics of his walking draw such a simple-yet-somehow-unexpectedly-detailed-and-convincing picture that it is unbelievable. Rooney Mara is also breathtaking, further proving that she is one of the best (at least)quasi-mainstream actresses working in America today. Much of her performance it seems to me is also based on body language, particularly what can be expressed through facial movements and expressions. In her silence, you can often tell she is deep in thought, and both her performance and David Lowery's excellent filmmaking are able to hint at what exactly she IS thinking, which is just brilliant. This is the pinnacle of a ""show don't tell"" type of movie (although there is one essential scene in the middle that kind of directly explains some of the movie's main themes and philosophical points of discussion in which a somewhat nihilistic hipster type makes a monologue that is somewhere between pretentious and profound (it is probably both)), it is also a contemplative film, forcing the viewer to commit him or herself to lengthy stretches of silence and seeming nothingness in order to finally finish one of the finest cinematic experiences to be released in 2017.",A Ghost Story
44,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of A Ghost Story,5,16 October 2017,"Remember when Casey Affleck appeared in 2002's Gerry? I do. I enjoyed that film despite the fact that certain scenes went on incessantly. A Ghost Story (my latest review) also stars Affleck. It too has extending wide shots and parlays over ninety minutes that could've just equaled an hour.Now did I like ""Story"" as much as Gerry? Not really. Despite a decent musical score and a wholly original template, A Ghost Story felt a little pretentious and a little too symbolic for my taste. With ""Story"", the camera peers in on every frame, there's some pseudo creepiness, and there's plenty of uncomfortable silences. A Ghost Story has slight shades of Terrence Malick and at the same time, gives off the whiff of being akin to an independent version of 1990's Ghost (starring Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore).Anyway, ""Story"" is filmed mostly at a real house outside of Irving, Texas. Said house could easily come off as the pic's unequivocal star. Shot on a screen resembling the outline of a small pool table, A Ghost Story isn't conventionally scary but is indeed about ghostly figures. There are a couple of them. They are dressed in white capes with eye holes cut out.Casey Affleck plays up apparition as an anonymous character. He's a husband who dies in a car accident and comes out of death as Casper for a new generation. He tries in afterlife fashion to connect with his grieving wife. Then, he lies dormant as his other half moves to a different town (Affleck's sweetie is yet another anonymous persona played by Bedford, NY native, Rooney Mara).In conclusion, ""Story"" is directed with soared ambition by David Lowery (Pete's Dragon, Ain't Them Bodies Saints). Lowery has tailored intentions but fails to give his audience an emotional connection to his troupers (we barely get to know anything about them except that they binge-eat homemade pies and then throw up). He also robs his flick of having a sustained level of entertainment value.Bottom line: A Ghost Story might make one hit the fast forward button on their DVD remote. It perturbs giving you every painstaking sequence from an extensive distance. Call it tricked ""storytelling"" that's announced as overthought, spoon-fed art. Rating: 2 stars.",A Ghost Story
45,bkrauser-81-311064,Into the Unknown Unknown,8,4 August 2017,"A Ghost Story is a movie of questions more than it is a movie about answers. Personal questions like, how do we know when to let go of our grief? Cosmological questions like, where do we go after die? Storied questions like, does the universality of the film's message justify its slump into generics? and practical questions like, why are we staring at a seven minute uninterrupted shot of Rooney Mara eating a whole f***ing pie on the kitchen floor? I put it rather glibly and part of me wants to dismiss this movie whole cloth. It channels the meditative pacing of a Tarkovsky film but lacks the visual acuity. It blends popular motifs from high-concept sci-fi but lacks much of the showiness. It grasps for drama but feels muted under the limitations it sets for itself. Truly if you come in with the expectation that you'll see a decent ""flick,"" you may wind up disappointing yourself.There is however, another way to see A Ghost Story. For beyond its questions, there's a deep well of feeling feeding into its Polaroid-esque frames. Perhaps not feelings that you actively seek to experience (mourning, melancholy, apathy and fear), but they exist so authentically in this film that they slowly sink into the soul. It's story, its characters, its technique - this film wounds you to your core. Trailblazing filmmaker Maya Deren once explained she wanted to make movies that ""put on film the feeling which a human being experiences about an incident, rather than to record the incident accurately."" It seems director David Lowery had the same idea.To summarize A Ghost Story would, A: fail to capture its essence, and B: almost be beside the point. The best primer for a movie of this stripe is to meditate on a deeply emotional childhood memory or the memory of a lost loved one. For then you can put yourself in the shoes of our central couple (Mara and Affleck), one of which spends most of the movie as a mute ghost covered in a sheet with eye holes. It's an odd costuming choice to be sure, but one that works both as a simple metaphor and a call-back to times of childhood whimsy.This in conjunction with the film's audacious editing gets us to understand that the titled ghost (and the film for that matter) perceives time differently. The film jumps and skips but never focuses on raising events but rather the imprint that is left behind. Dream logic prevails, but never to confuse or subvert. It rather gives a strange kind of comfort to the fears that lay dormant in the mind; that of the unknown unknown.A Ghost Story is a singular experience. The one shortcoming I winced at, may well be your favorite moment (or maybe the only good moment) in a movie that is as audacious as it is unassuming. I'm not going to claim I fully understand it. But I cannot deny that the feeling of it is constant and arguably eternal.",A Ghost Story

From then on the movie evolves with the ghost walking here and there, to and fro chiefly in his old house without being seen by anyone and without us knowing what he is up to.

53,proud_luddite,A Ghost Story,7,27 January 2018,"In a rural area of the U.S., a young man (Casey Affleck) is recently deceased. His ghost (covered in a white sheet with holes for the eyes) lingers in the house he once shared with his wife (Rooney Mara) as she grieves, unaware of his presence.The first section of the film involves the couple in an intimate way. The directing style by David Lowery (also the film's writer) is deliberately quiet and attentive. This pays off well especially in this early segment particularly a scene where the woman has a binge-eating scene (all in a single take) as an attempt to cope with her grief.The conclusion of this segment is the movie's most powerful moment. The quiet sadness is almost overwhelming as one can feel so much sympathy for both characters. Had the movie began with earlier segments before the death and then finished with this scene, it would have been the perfect ending leaving the audience with a gulp in the throat.It would be an exaggeration to say the movie goes 'downhill' from there. The film's remainder is still interesting but not nearly as good as the first segment.As the ghost stays in the house, there is an unnecessary 'haunted house' segment against the house's next inhabitants. The following segment, with different inhabitants, includes a party where a guest blurts a pompous pontification about the uselessness of trying to be remembered after death. Some of the points in this monologue are interesting but it's just too long. Will Oldham plays this role well if only to remind us of the kind of person many of us have tried to avoid at parties in our past.Later sequences involve the switching of time periods. While this section is better than the middle, one is still left wondering at the end if it was necessary and how consistent it was with the more powerful beginning.In the end, ""A Ghost Story"" is a fine film dealing with the subject of grief - not only for the woman who lost her husband but also for the man's spirit who sees his loved one getting on in her life without him.",A Ghost Story
54,sharky_55,We do what we can to endure.,7,28 October 2017,"Director David Lowery has done something more than just a little tricky in A Ghost Story. By shoving Oscar winner Casey Affleck into a tutu and covering his face with a white bedsheet complete with fitted eyeholes, he takes an age-old image and gives it new meaning. The premise of the ghost is absurd, a cheap Halloween costume that can be assembled in minutes with a pair of old scissors, and yet Lowery pushes on through sheer persistence, and eventually we stop giggling, and are left to contemplate in the silence. The first moments of the ghost's existence show off the film's mastery of its early tone, a jet-black, deadpan humour that eventually descends into poignancy. The shot lingers on his corpse on the hospital bed, quietly in mourning, and then as if he was a player in a schlocky Undertaker wrestling bit, he lurches back to life and glances around at this obvious error in management. Bewildered, he shuffles down the corridor, unseen by the staff and mortal world. Then at the tunnel of light that tries to reclaim him, he pauses, as if considering all the unfinished business he still has on this earth, and offers a casual ""No thanks"". Of course he refuses the call. Lowery captures the film's events with no more than a few dozen complete shots, favouring slow pan reveals and long takes which allow the actors the space to settle into their scenes, and their body language to flourish. Few directors, least of all those who had just completed a Disney blockbuster, would shoot with this much patience, allowing time to slowly bleed out. But it makes for moments of such genuine, lived-in human emotion, the foremost of those an early overhead shot of the main couple snuggling up in bed. If two people could be physically any closer I haven't seen it, as Mara and Affleck drink each other up, establishing a strong case for the ghost's refusal to say goodbye to the home which housed that intimacy. Another of Lowery's unbroken takes drew praise at Sundance, but may be a little more grating for the mainstream audience; five long minutes consisting solely of Mara attacking and devouring a pie in her post-mortem grief, then stumbling over to the toilet to vomit it all out. The moment is stripped of all artifice, Mara's M laid bare and exposed for all to see, the scraping and chewing of her desperate attempt to feel something ringing through the room. Lowery had previous worked with the pair in Ain't Them Bodies Saints, a modern Texan riff on the Bonnie and Clyde dynamic that was stylised as Malick-lite, sparse on narrative momentum and pieced together through whispered, magic-hour memories. Although drawing from some very familiar sources, it worked; I admired the structural cohesion of a film consisting of two separate strands (sans the cheesy moment where Affleck peeks through the window into his former home), which together formed a portrait of two lovers doomed always to seek out each other. What Lowery has done here is far more novel, stripping away all but the most functional of dialogue, and like an old fashioned silent film, letting universal motions tell his story. The image of a spirit in a sheet scratching feebly at paint is amusing until it's not, a cosmic farce of tragic proportions, the universe playing a mean joke on a mourner. Lowery finds his own style, going low budget and self- funding. The film is boxed through a 1.33:1 aspect ratio with vignetted frames, and cinematographer Andrew Palermo throws soft haze through every interior so the entire experience is like flicking through a dusty book of old photographs, intimate and intrusive all at the same time.I think where the film ultimately falters is when Lowery is forced to declare his intentions in a monologue mid-way, a move which has been dubbed pretentious by some, but also operates equally well as a slap in the face of the ghost's existence. The script sneaks the speech under the guise of a stoner's drunken party monologue but subconsciously gives it enough thematic heft by allocating so much of its precious screen time; it is the sheer obnoxiousness of Lowery's musings spilling out for all to hear, especially after about an hour long mood poem. Even with the sly irony of the whole situation, with an immortal spirit standing right there contradicting his nihilistic ramblings, it's too on the nose. Between that and the tendency to dissolve from domestic interiors to intergalactic nebula, the whole thing is too obvious, too wanting. Lowery doesn't have to go cosmic to sell us on the tragedy of our limited time. See how M and C hold each other. They already know.",A Ghost Story

56,aciessi,Boo.,4,11 January 2020,"It's thesis is great. It's locations and actions are minimal, which more often than not, is more powerful. But yet, A Ghost Story is one of the most pretentious films i've ever seen. I might be in the minority on this one, but you know what, let me make my case.There is a fine line between making a truly effective art film, and self-indulging yourself to the point of absurdity. A Ghost Story sways back and forth between that line, and that really disappointed me. There are so many instances where this film just shoves itself up it's own ass. Just because you can hold on a shot for a long period of time, doesn't mean that you should. There are so many one-shot scenes that go on for an eternity, without anything happening. I get it, it's a ghost story, so that's creepy and all. But it's not creepy, it's boring here. I kid you not, one of the pivotal scenes in A Ghost Story is watching Rooney Mara eat an entire pie.. FOR 5 STRAIGHT MINUTES! What's the point? Why was it necessary to hold on this micro action for so long? We get a little suspense when she begins emotionally stabbing at the pie, giving us the indication that she's breaking down over the loss of her boyfriend. We also see the Ghost staring at her doing this in the background. So the idea is having the Ghost voyeuristically watching the woman he used to love grieve over his death. I would would have tried many other micro-actions to explore, and I assure you, a pie wouldn't even be my last resort. My other issue was the overly dramatic musical score. If minimalism was the key, this film should have had no score. Cinema verite is what was trying to be accomplished here, and a giant orchestra kind of ruins the illusion.What disappoints me even more is when A Ghost Story shows us those glimpses of effective storytelling. There are a few great scenes here. Two that stand out to me is the unspoken dialogue between two next-door neighbor ghosts, and a deconstruction of a haunting that cleverly shows us how a ghost scares it's occupants. Also, the interpretation of ghosts looking like Charlie Brown's cut out, white sheeted costume was a great touch that added a nice balance of humor and poignancy. What's even better is knowing that Casey Affleck is under there, and you don't need to see or hear from him for the rest of the movie. Ah, I wish this was better.",A Ghost Story

I was puzzled by the trailer for this one but at the same time excited to see David Lowery reunite with both Rooney and Casey Affleck  (they all previously worked on Ain't Them Bodies Saints). Having now seen A Ghost Story and letting it sink in I can say that I am very impressed by the minimalist structure and beautifully haunting experience that I have experienced. While I'm still trying to unpack some aspects of the film, I'm already beaming about a re-watch.The film follows a couple played by Mara and Affleck. One day Afflecks unnamed character dies in a car accident. We then see his body reanimated as a ghost under an ominous white morgue sheet. He then returns to the house he and his girlfriend lived in and watches Mara and how her life progresses as she deals with the loss of a loved one. The film carries on long after the girlfriend moves and the house goes through new inhabitants ultimately leading to the destruction of the house and the building of a skyscraper against a futuristic backdrop.I wasn't a giant fan of the use of the 1:33:1 aspect ratio but I can definitely see the sense of being ""trapped in a box"" that he was going for. I plan to buy this film on Blu-ray so I probably would have liked a more fuller ratio. And with that ends my criticism of this film. A Ghost Story is presented in a minimalist fashion. The dialogue is sparse, the film had a small budget, the script is also direct and straightforward. Yet the film is so complex. The film is an excellent portrayal of loneliness and despair. The scene with Rooney Mara stress eating (or for lack of a better term: grief eating) a pie is pure and raw emotion. She doesn't have to say much but she perfectly portrays a grieving woman who is so withdrawn and alone. Believe it or not, Casey Affleck under the sheet is pretty incredible as well. You don't see him for 85% of the film yet you know exactly when his ghost is feeling rage, grief, and longing. Apparently the eye shape on the sheet changes to convey different emotions. This is something I'll have to study upon a second watch. The film is shot so beautifully. Its such haunting cinematography; seeing an ominous looking ghost in a white sheet on screen in the corner and yet this film isn't a horror film in the typical sense. Yes the film is about a ghost and there are some scenes that can be deemed scary but its chilling and haunting in a beautiful way. The film digs deep into you and keeps you wondering what exactly will happen to Affleck's ghost character. Lowery abandons conventional structure for this film and portrays a story from minimal set pieces. There is a cyclical nature to the film and also a portrayal of never ending time and the changes that come and go. The last 20 or so minutes are just perfect.I still do not feel like I fully understand the ending of the film. That is the beauty of the film, I think there is room for interpretation. I enjoyed Ain't Them Bodies Saints, but this was just a whole new level of masterful from David Lowery. The film is deceivingly strong and is a fantastic exploration into love and loss. I hope to see a trilogy of films with Mara, Lowery, and Affleck because this film was an engulfing experience for me and one that I can't wait to come back to.8/10",A Ghost Story

59,swilliky,Slow-paced but moving and thoughtful,8,7 August 2017,"A brilliant trailer with a clever concept, beautiful shots, and moving song made this film one of my most anticipated of the year once I heard of it. David Lowery has made some interesting choices before this film ranging from dramas to kids movies even working with Casey Affleck and Rooney Mara previously. The two actors play a couple unnamed but living together in a house where strange noises spook them at night. They argue over whether to move out or not while Affleck's C works on music and Mara's M throws out their belongings. The story is told with long simple shots that hang there observing the character go about their mundane lives. The romance ends abruptly when C is in a car accident outside their house.M says goodbye to him and walks out of the hospital and the ghost sits up in his hospital sheets. He has a chance to walk through a door to the other side but decides to walk home to watch his wife grieve. There is an infamous scene where Rooney Mara eats nearly a whole pie in one shot. The ghost watches her move on with her life and becomes angry when she meets another man. He can make the lights flicker and when really frustrated flip over objects. M finally moves out leaving the ghost behind to stare out the window after her. In one of the creepier parts of the film, the ghost sees another ghost in the neighboring house waiting for someone but they can't remember who.

61,kjproulx,A Mind-Alteringly Realistic Depiction Of Human Life,10,25 September 2017,"This movie is simultaneously not for everyone, while also trying to demand everyone's attention. That statement may confuse some people, so please listen closely if you're intrigued, because this review if going to be about me gushing on how incredible this film is. Whole critics seem to general love this film, average moviegoers seem to be pretty divisive on this film in retrospect. Personally, I completely see how many would be bored or turned off by this film, so whether or not you like this film is up to you. Personally, this film opened my mind in ways I wasn't expecting and I found myself in a state of transfixion when the credits began to role. So, this review will definitely lean heavily on a recommendation to everyone, but please be advised that the film itself is absolutely not for everyone. Now that I have that out of the way, let's dive in. As a couple is about to move out of their first house onto bigger and better things, the husband (Casey Affleck) dies in a tragic accident. The film then follows the wife (Rooney Mara) as she copes with her loss. The husband returns in ghost form, walking around the halls of the house, watching her every move, stating that people really do watch over us after they die. This premise is fantastic, but the visuals themselves and the way the movie is constructed is what I feel may turn many people off. Coming off cheap by literally having the husband dressed in a bed sheet, the movie may seem cheesy to some, but that's not the point of it at all. From long takes of people sitting alone in a room to time travel in order to open viewers mind's, this movie takes many risks, but I think they are all genius in their own right if you're in the proper mood when watching this film. Going from many short films, to independent features, to a big blockbuster in last year's Pete's Dragon, director David Lowrey has been all over the business, so it was pretty clear that this was a passion project for him, and that the amount of viewers this film gained didn't matter to him in the slightest. I think this was the best way to make a movie like this, because only the most hardcore film fans will probably discover it, which is where I feel it's best suited anyways. There is so much symbolism about the meaning of life and which aspects of it really matter the most, but I feel as though many viewers won't catch on. Once again, if you're in the right mindset and are open to literally anything, then I believe you'll have the same reaction to this film that I did. Many viewers like being able to relate to a character when they speak to someone and open up about themselves, but this film is very far from anything like that. There are stretches of the film that can last up to 30 minutes without a single word being spoken, leaving it up to your interpretation on how they're feeling or what they're thinking. This is a very lonely-feeling film that you need to be relaxed and open-minded about. In my opinion, when a film can show you a piece of imagery and have you understand what a character is going through, what they're thinking, all while giving you a sincere look at our planet as a whole, when it's accomplishing everything it set out to do, and then some. Simply put, sometimes showing things to an audience is much more powerful than having it explained. In the end, A Ghost Story is strangely enough one of the most powerful experiences you'll be able to see an all of 2017. Now, there isn't much dialogue, so you really have to pay attention and think about every piece of imagery, but if you're willing to do that, then I believe you will have a terrific experience as well. If you're not into this film after the first 10-20 minutes then you're either not in the right mindset or it's just not for you, which I completely understand. Many people will hate this movie, but I believe the message itself is worth waiting for alone. A Ghost Story is easily one of my favourite films of the year and I can't wait to watch it multiple times",A Ghost Story
62,kuarinofu,A little unfocused,7,2 August 2020,"A Ghost Story (2017) is an interesting experience with a couple of flaws.It's not too long, but some scenes are intentionally stretched out, not all of those are enhanced by the buffed duration though. This will turn some audiences off the film very fast.
Also, I thought this would be more a love story, but this is a ghost story indeed, so after some time it loses focus and starts pinballing through different philosophies and thoughts about space, time, and the futility of one's life. Yet the ending goes full circle and it feels complete. I'd still love the ghost being more human.While we didn't get a whole lot of the love relationship, it worked surprisingly well and the chemistry was there. This was probably the reason why I rate this film higher than I thought I would. Too bad they didn't push all the way with this plotline. Rooney Mara is beautiful and while I don't fully support Casey Affleck's hair in this, I was seriously envious of their relationship, knowing that I would probably never have that in what's left of my life.Overall - most audiences would not like this film because of many reasons, some of which are legit. Many people will like it just for the artsy elements of it, and thinkers will enjoy the resonating emotions and ideas they might find in there for themselves.P.S. 1.33 : 1 aspect ratio did nothing for me though.",A Ghost Story
63,msbreviews,Rating: A-,8,20 October 2017,"David Lowery tells the story of a recently deceased man (Casey Affleck) that returns as a white-sheeted ghost to his home. He is lost in time and he has to watch life go by as well as his wife's pain.It is a journey through memory and history, confronting life's fundamental questions and reflecting on love and grief.This is David Lowery's craft, period. His screenplay is incredibly emotional and the fantastic amount of visual storytelling elevate this film so damn much. I still find myself thinking about the story because it is so magnificently told, it is definitely the standout aspect of the movie.His direction is a masterpiece worthy of several awards. There are so many excruciating long takes that build up the pain, the despair and the sadness that one feels when losing someone close. Scenes that take 10 seconds in a conventional film, go for minutes without end in A Ghost Story and they build up so enormously.The realistic cinematography creates a heavy environment that works really well with the tone of the movie and the (lack of) soundtrack makes every scene even more powerful. The absolute silence in an empty house has such a profound and compelling meaning, but it never seems that the film is trying to be pretentious.Going back to the writing, there is barely any dialogue ... I would say that only 15 minutes of the runtime are speaking scenes, while the rest of it is a huge number of one-take shots filled with amazing build- ups that culminate in a greatly emotional third act.The story itself is depressingly amazing. I know, how can a story be amazing if it is depressing? Well, this movie is so well-crafted and the screenplay is so well-told that it makes me feel happy that I got the chance to watch this film. It is a brilliantly directed movie, even though its story is one of the saddest I have ever witnessed.The film improves with each act, but the last one is clearly the best. Due to the huge amount of emotion stored during the previous hour- ish, the third act's climax is so astonishingly potent and heartfelt. The ending generates so many feelings that I stood still for a while, dealing with both the frustration and despair that the movie transmitted to me.Rooney Mara steals the show, even though the main character is someone under a white sheet (if it is Casey Affleck the whole time or not, I don't know). There are so many long takes that she handles so perfectly, proving that she is a very capable actress. There is a scene that I will never forget and it just involves Rooney eating a pie ... As simple as that is, it is one of the most disturbing and sad moments I have seen these last few years.Casey Affleck is OK. He barely has any screen time (I mean, showing his face) and he doesn't exactly stand up to Rooney Mara's level, but he works fine for the plot. The only major issue I have with the film is its pacing mixed with the story. There is a thin line between being deliberately slow and just plain boring ... Sometimes, Lowery crosses that line and the movie might become briefly boring for some people.Also, I don't think this film has any replay value. Similarly to Manchester By The Sea, its story and tone are too depressing for someone to want to watch this film again or showing it to friends or family. It is a one-time only screening, at least for me.All in all, A Ghost Story is David Lowery's masterpiece. His direction is unbelievably great, his screenplay has so much beautiful visual storytelling and his story is incredibly powerful and emotional. Rooney Mara has one of her best performances yet, while Casey Affleck is just fine. However, I think it is a one-time only cosmic journey that even though it is depressing and sad, it still leaves some very unusual feelings on everyone that goes through this life experience.MSB Reviews - If you enjoyed my review, please follow my blog :)",A Ghost Story
64,SameirAli,"Beautiful Story, not Horror...!!",9,6 November 2017,"I had no expectations before watching this movie. I thought it will was a Horror flick, that is not my favorite genre.From the beginning to the end, it has the essence of a great movie. Reminding the childhood days of Cinema, a great essence of nostalgia of the Classic films. Shot in 1.33 : 1, and steady frames, it sometimes suffocates the audience, that was the best point. What we don't see creates curiosity and it holds us into the film. Some shots were too long (for example the Pie scene) but the end makes us to realize why it was so long. Frames were really beautiful. It could blend the essence of yesteryear and the prosperity of today.Highly recommended for serious film lovers. #KiduMovie",A Ghost Story

66,rajdoctor,Empathy for a Sad Spirit of LOVE seeking closure,7,2 November 2018,"""A Ghost Story"" is not a horror movie. It does not scare. It is a life-story of a spirit that travels through time waiting for LOVEIt is a disappointment for hard-core horror movie fans and a boring movie for those who expect chills because of the title ""A Ghost Story""""A Ghost Story"" is a totally different take on the genre of ghost movies. It sees ghosts with a lot of EMPATHY.Two lovers Mr.C (Casey Affleck) and Ms. M (Rooney Mara) are a couple who LOVE each other immensely. Casey dies, but his spirit stays in the house - observing his LOVE Ms.M - who moves out of the house - leaving a small note of LOVE for his LOVE Mr.C in a small crevice.
New families move in and go out of that house but the Ghost of Mr.C stays back in order to be able to take out that note from the crevice to read. But the unused house is demolished to build a high rise Office Block. The Ghosts travels around the offices - but not leaving the spot.In order to come back to its original time- of Mr.C and Ms.M's LOVE - the Ghost time-travels to that era when Europeans were new immigrants to North American Red-Indian land.From there Mr.C's Ghost travels forward and lands up in the house much before Mr.C and Ms.M occupy the house. And the Ghost waits for the moment - where he can read the LOVE note - to release its spirit.It is a beautiful sad poignant LOVE story - where our heart goes out for the ghost.The format and style of movie is excruciatingly slow - testing patience of audiences with long lingering scenes where nothing happens.But if you are sensitive person and feel the pain of the ghosts' seeking and search for Lost LOVE - you will be intrigued to know - what will happen in the end.Cassey Affleck's and Rooney Mara's roles are small - but both are apt in their performances.All credit goes to the director David Lovery (who has made 12 shorts and 4 feature films before this) to conceptualize such a different tale of LOVE.There are a few stand out moments in the movie - that are well crafted. The movie hardly has any dialogues. There is one beautiful long monologue of a new resident Bonny Prince Billy on life-death and end-of-the-world storyThe music director has created beautiful sound track and back ground score that is haunting and depicts the real story through its soulful lyrics.
""The Secret in the wall"" (meaning the love note) and ""I get overwhelmed"" stand out.I end by saying that so many times we get eerier feeling in a house of a spirit hovering over us. Who come and touch us. Who whisper things in our ears - who stand and watch us.After you see this movie - you will understand that - such spirit exists and may be standing right besides you watching you - while you are reading this review.It demands a new mind-set from the audience and a lot of patience like a TRUE LOVERz.I would say - Not for everyone - but for those who LOVE different kind of cinema.I would go with 7 out of 10)",A Ghost Story
67,MrDHWong,An interesting look into the writer/director's psyche of what life after death could be like,7,1 November 2017,"A Ghost Story is a drama film written and directed by David Lowery (Pete's Dragon). Starring Casey Affleck and Rooney Mara, this low budget film is an interesting look into the writer/director's psyche of what life after death could be like.In a small country house, struggling musician C (Casey Affleck) lives with his wife M (Rooney Mara), who regardless of the problems they face, stick together through their difficult times. One day, C is involved in a fatal car accident and comes back as a white-sheeted ghost, completely invisible to everyone around him. As he tries to understand why he has returned in such a form, C can only watch on helplessly and observe his widow M mourning his death and attempt to move on with her life.Despite its title, this is not a full-on horror film but rather a thought-provoking look into dealing with the speed of life and coping with loss. The limited dialogue gives the audience an almost documentary-style look into the way someone deals with the sudden loss of a loved one. However, I do feel that this story would have worked better as a 20 to 30 minute short film rather than a full length motion picture. There were a number of scenes that did drag and felt like filler to pad out the runtime. A casual film-goer will likely find this movie boring and pretentious, but I personally found it to be quite clever and philosophical for the most part.I rate it 7/10",A Ghost Story
68,Alexander_Blanchett,Long 90 minutes,6,26 December 2017,"I am all for experimental films but this film felt a bit like a poor man's Terrence Malick. It was meditative in a way but also extremely slow moving for its short running time. i mean I get it that the way it works is rather with images than with dialogues. But still watching Casey Affleck almost 1 hour walking around with a bed sheet and without any substantive dialogue is a bit boring on a long shot. What I found interesting is how David Lowery showed the the different decades and how they affect the one location the film is taking place at. I liked that - a lot. To see the changes, to see people come and go and to see how it all developes... it gave me a melancholic feeling of being irrelevant in a way but at least that did move something within me. 
Perfomrance wise it is nothing too special. Casey Affleck mumbles through the film in the beginning and then just walks around covered with that mentioned bed sheets. Rooney Mara has some good moments but she had better moments this year. I liked the imaginary and the editing and soundtrack was fine enough. But it is definitely not a film for everybody and I don't think it is very essential except for that one melancholic feeling it raised.",A Ghost Story
69,CANpatbuck3664,A Ghost Story Unintentionally Scares Away Anything That Could be Interesting About it,3,12 November 2017,"The two nice things I can say about A Ghost Story is that the cinematography and the score are well done. As much as I'm going to rip on this movie, Lowery is a capable director and has a following as an indie filmmaker for a reason. He had a very clear vision for this movie and as much as it wasn't my thing, he did execute it.The acting is the next category where I can say I was a little mixed on things. Casey Affleck and Rooney Mara are both okay in their respective roles as C and M. You spend a lot of time with them because of the movie's refusal to cut scenes down to watchable lengths but I couldn't connect with them emotionally. The movie wants to have pathos desperately but other than the fact that C dies young, why would we attach ourselves to them? Sure we watch them snuggling for 10 minutes and they seem nice, why should I care?! But what I want to reiterate is that I don't blame Casey and Rooney for it.Getting to what I couldn't stand about this movie is the complete lack of plot progression. C dies and he watches his girlfriend M deal with his passing and move on. He then watches a family move in and move out of this house and he occasionally interacts with another ghost that has been there so long that it has forgotten who they are waiting for. The key is that large amounts of time pass instantaneously. Part of the problem is that C doesn't interact with anyone through dialogue and there's no narration or monologue to detail how he's feeling as this is happening. This is a zero sum game where NOTHING HAPPENS except for 1 or 2 instances that last for a couple of minutes max. We're literally watching him watch other people, that's the crux of this movie. This makes the movie unbearable in every sense of the word.The next problem is the style in which Lowery decides to film and edit it. The takes last minutes and that doesn't mean anything happens. One of the most talked about scenes in this movie is where we watch M eat a whole pie over 5-10 minutes. Who decides that we needed to see that? Its IRRITATING, there wasn't enough material here for a whole movie so were these long scenes a ploy to stretch it out to feature length? If so, bravo! The critics ate this up but I refuse to.I also want to comment on the message of the movie. They're trying to make a point about the impermanence of life and how powerful grief can be, I didn't miss the point or not get it. If you didn't pick this up, there is a big monologue by a party guest about how what we accomplish (having kids, writing a symphony, being an author etc.) is ultimately pointless and everything you do and whoever you know will eventually die or be forgotten. This is supposed to be profound but it was just pretentious. Did people not know this? I just assumed it was common knowledge. If you didn't know, life is fleeting and eventually our individual accomplishments will be forgotten. NO S#!*. That's how life as a human being is. I knew that already and I didn't need to listen to someone brag about knowing it for 10 minutes! It's not that the message is offensive, its that its delivered pretentiously and its common knowledge. I don't know why everyone sees it as this profound thing, its not.I can appreciate their approach to this movie in trying to do something different. I didn't go into watching A Ghost Story wanting to hate it or deliberately trying to make fun of it. The long and the short of if is that very little happens in this movie and what does happen isn't interesting. It's boring throughout and you literally watch paint dry. I'm glad the critics got something out of it, I didn't find anything to enjoy. I didn't even think the acting was noteworthy and when you've got a movie led by Casey Affleck and Rooney Mara, that's saying something. I have to call this movie what it is: boring and ineffective. I didn't hate this completely and my real rating would be 3.5/10 but I think audience members who aren't critics or aren't in film studies are going to hate this.",A Ghost Story
70,Jithindurden,Eternal Entrapment,9,18 November 2017,A Ghost Story is about the entrapment of souls in spaces they can't leave forever. They may be forced to do things that keep everyone distant but its the closeness they want out of it. Change is too fast and the slow-paced past times may be what is more comfortable.

72,oOoBarracuda,A Ghost Story,2,14 August 2017,"Despite all the negativity many associated with 2016, and rightly so, it brought a special gift with it that I have not stopped embracing. I still talk about Manchester by the Sea, I'll probably endlessly sing this film's praises. Since seeing Manchester by the Sea five times in theatres, I decided to check out more from its writer/director Kenneth Lonergan. I also began to eagerly anticipate Casey Affleck's next project. I was even more excited when I read about A Ghost Story. When I read about this modest film tackling the biggest issues of existence and life's unanswered questions, I did the kind of happy dance only a student of philosophy would do. The 2017 film directed by David Lowry promised to be a simplistic yet grand look at love and loss, and how to endure when we lose someone prematurely. Everything about it sounded right up my alley, I even traveled nearly two hours away to be able to see it so to say I was invested would be an understatement. Needless to say, I obviously took a wrong turn, because I didn't see A Ghost Story fulfill what it promised, nor did the film speak to me in an impactful way. I experienced a complete lack of emotion as the lights came back on in the empty theatre and was left pondering, not the meaning of existence or its meaninglessness, but just how self-important a film could appear without ever actualizing its vision. C (Casey Affleck) is killed in an automobile accident. Unable to leave behind his love M (Rooney Mara) he hovers between the living and the dead, maintaining some level of existence as a ghost, white sheet and all. He witnesses M readjust to her life of day-to-day menial activities, and even witnesses her possibly move on in her love life with another person. Desperate to maintain a connection with her, he spends his time trying to obtain a personally meaningful piece of her that she left behind in the house they shared together. As he attempts to recover the last piece of his love he has access to, he sees the world change as he is catapulted through the years. Not only does the ghost see far into the future, but he sees far into the past, as well, and is shown the family responsible for the first fence post put in on the land where his house would eventually be built. An exploration on the grandiose scale of the world often ignored by our own self-interest, A Ghost Story attempts to construct a fresh look using many borrowed pieces from philosophy and literature that never quite materializes.Few things make me happier, cinematically than a ""little film that could"". A minimalist story with modest sets and sparse dialogue is almost certain to endear itself to me. I should have loved A Ghost Story. There is only one scene in which we see more than two people on screen together and one of the main characters is dead throughout most of the film's runtime, yet, the film still fails to achieve its self-professed ""smallness"". Perhaps my main gripe about the film's alleged simplicity lies in the heavy-handed way it delivers its message. There is not a single bit of this film that gives the audience enough tools to arrive at the desired conclusion on their own. Instead of subtlety, David Lowry presents images and statements that drive home his message hand-over-fist. I get it, and I got it about 30 minutes into the movie that life is meaningless and much greater than our individual lives that most people remain focused on throughout their day. I didn't need a stroll through the past or to be jolted into the future to understand that there are more people than me in the world and we're all going to die. That lesson is one that I would have much rather experienced in a philosophy course than to see in a film using such a blatant method. Granted, I minored in philosophy during my undergrad so these are themes I consider often, but the change in pace the film underwent switching from its initial egoism bent to its collectivism was disengaging and disingenuous. It seems as though the film is attempting to make a grand philosophical statement while maintaining an infantile view on life and its meaning. I also have an aversion to stylistic decisions that don't seem to serve a purpose. In A Ghost Story, the aspect ratio chosen seems to only exist as a self-serving gesture meant to remind the audience that it is an art film. A Ghost Story hardly treads new ground, as it promised, and left me in a cold emotionless state. A technical achievement, A Ghost Story would have left me far less angry if that was all it wanted to be, but the intellectualism it attempts while showing no regard for the intelligence of the audience sours me on its product completely.",A Ghost Story
73,garethcrook,"A surprising depiction of tender and heart-wrenching, love, loss, life and death.",9,18 May 2018,"Shot in 4:3 with retro rounded corners, this film right from the outset feels slightly voyeuristic, like looking in through a window. Slow drifting cameras and locked off shots, there's a real subtlety and patience. The sound department have had a lot of fun too, there's so much space to play with, the aural cues often the one element pacing the scenes in which time is fluid. Despite being packed with creepy shots, there's a huge amount of warmth and empathy. Affleck carries his character silently under the sheet better than anyone has a right to. It's equal parts daring and arrogant, oddly captivating and extremely disarming. A surprising depiction of tender and heart-wrenching, love, loss, life and death.

74,ronakkotian,Interesting but excruciatingly slow,5,28 July 2020,"I heard how great this film was and it does have some neat ideas but I feel its execution wasn't that great.A Ghost Story is about a dead man, who returns in the form of a sheeted ghost, to try and reconnect with his wife.I'm not someone that hates slow films. A lot of my favourite films recently are slow but I felt A Ghost Story was WAY too slow. It's only 90 minutes long but it felt like forever. It didn't connect with me as much I thought it would and it probably is the slowest film I've ever seen. Despite that, the film does look very beautiful. This film had a budget of $100,000 and it looks better than a lot of high budget films. This is a great example of what you can achieve regardless of your budget.On top of that, David Lowery does explore some interesting themes relating to death and loss. I was happy for the most part at how Lowery conveyed all these messages but one scene really ruined it for me. There was this hipster guy who pretty much summed up the entire point of the film through dialogue and that was what really annoyed me about the film. Just explaining everything through exposition is so lazy. I don't know why Lowery decided to keep that in since it would have been so much better without it.I don't think A Ghost Story is particularly terrible. It deals with some interesting ideas but its execution definitely needed tweaking. It is very good looking film and Rooney Mara is especially great in it but the pacing and that one scene ruined it for me.",A Ghost Story
75,bgar-80932,Tough,3,2 June 2018,"I watched this movie because I really liked Manchester By The Sea and it made me more interested in Casey Affleck. I heard reviews and knew it'd be slow moving but I didn't think it would be pointless. That's not completely fair because some of it comes together by the end but man it was tough for me to finish. I swear there's one scene where one character eats a whole pie for like 5 minutes. Is that really needed to show that character is sad? I mean maybe I would do that but not everything is worth filming that's for sure. And that little tid bit is like how 80% of the movie is, just full of nothingness. The end kind of makes me satisfied but it wasn't surprising or anything it was kinda clear what was going to happen.",A Ghost Story
76,bregund,Slow as molasses,3,14 September 2018,"There are some compelling themes of life, death, romance, and humanity presented in this film, but the problem is they are rolled out so achingly slowly that you'll lose patience long before the film makes its points. This movie has the art-house sensibilities and pacing of a 1970s experimental film, which would have been interesting back then, but is asking way too much of modern audiences. You have my attention for an hour and a half, say something interesting or you're going to lose me; this film never gets there. It's rather amusing that actors spend their entire careers relying on their faces to do most of the work, but Affleck's is buried under a sheet for almost the entire film, and on top of that we never even learn his name, or anything else about him for that matter. This may be the point of the film, we're all just here temporarily, but surely there is a more entertaining way of conveying this idea. If you want entertaining existentialism, just watch Groundhog Day, that film never gets old and it has romance, comedy, and drama.",A Ghost Story
77,CineMuseFilms,a haunting reflection on grief and what lies beyond the last heartbeat,8,30 July 2017,"It is no spoiler to say there is nothing to be afraid of in this film. No blood to be seen, no jumps out of your seat. That could mean many supernatural and paranormal film fans will stay away, but they would be missing one of the most unusual and thought-provoking films seen in years. If you can look past the costume party white sheet with jagged eye-holes, you will find A Ghost Story (2017) to be a haunting reflection on grief and what lies beyond the last heartbeat.Although it has an unsettling timeline, the story itself can be pared down to a few simple elements. We enter by eavesdropping on a young couple who are packing to leave their modest home. Known only as C (Casey Affleck) and M (Rooney Mara), she is keen to leave, he wants to stay. What happens next messes with our notions of time, space, death and beyond. Within seconds, we see him dead at the wheel of a crashed car. We watch her identify the body then walk out of a morgue. The camera remains fixed on the sheet until it slowly sits up. We follow it back to the house where it can only watch M in her stunned grief, unseen and unable to reach her. In a series of rapid time compressions, she packs and leaves, and is replaced by a procession of other families until the house becomes derelict and abandoned. All the time C watches alone. After a bulldozer flattens the house and a high-rise is built, we go back to when the property was an open prairie where a family of 19th century settlers are slaughtered by natives. C watches them decompose, still riveted to the place he too died. He returns to the time and place of his death to see himself and M arrive in their new home.This unusual story unfolds from the viewpoint of a ghost. Once you are OK with that premise, everything else begins to make sense, depending on what you invest in the experience. When you let go of the usual paranormal genre tropes, you sense that ghosts occupy space without temporal boundaries and they do no harm. You also realise that cinema itself has conditioned our notions of linear time and physical place. Nobody has been there to report back, so who can refute the circularity of time after death? Nor do we know if ghosts can materially connect with the living or if they simply 'belong' at the place they became.This low-budget high-risk film is one of the most innovative you will find in its genre but opinions are clustered at the extremes. Despite having a stellar duo in Casey Affleck and Rooney Mara, acting makes a limited contribution to what this film achieves. The silent Affleck is mostly under the sheet and Mara is brilliant for the time we see her. There are no CGI tricks and the film is shown through a round-corner square screen that is retro low-tech with editing and pace to unnerve you. Patience and faith are both needed and rewarded. The unbroken five-minute take of M sitting on her kitchen floor devouring a pie with C watching helplessly is a painfully exquisite portrait of transfixed grief. Surviving that scene can be a portal for a tale from the timeless beyond.",A Ghost Story

Lingering on shots for no reason whatsoever.The music was so predominant and irritating. I don't want to be aware of music in films. It should blend in, but never stand out unless there is a real purpose for it.I don't know how they made this for $100,000 (I don't buy that for a second), but perhaps because they forgot to hire a sound guy since the audio wasn't good. Leaving the camera rolling for a long periods of time saved them on different scenes and locations.Like we really need to see her carry out trash for 3 minutes or eat for 7 minutes in silence. YES, 7 freaking minutes of watching her eat.I skipped until the end, and god only knows what happened.

82,WalkdenEntertainment,You Can't Call The Ghostbusters This Time...,9,10 January 2019,"A Ghost Story stars academy award winner Casey Affleck as C and actress Rooney Mara as M. It's clear from the start that C & M are in love and share a home together. We see them as a couple, having deep conversations and also falling into disagreements about past life choices.After an unexpected and tragic event, C (Casey Affleck) awakes at a hospital in a long white sheet with two holes for his eyes. He has also lost the power of speech. C chooses to return to his suburban home and tries to reconnect with his wife once again.Ghost Story is a simple film filled dramatic and beautiful visuals, but this beauty comes at a price. The price audiences must pay is patience, as you have to sit through long scenes. One such scene involved M (Rooney Mara) eating dinner while being rather emotional and C (The Ghost) watching her eat from afar. This scene alone, with no dialogue in it whatsoever, continued what felt like 5 minutes.The film doesn't have a wordy script but aims high visually, and truly takes its time to show Ghost's journey. Our Ghost (C) isn't just mopping around. Throughout the film it's obvious that he's trying to seek peace as the world around him continues on without him. It was easy to enjoy this film because it was filled with so many crafty shots and is filmed beautifully. If you're expecting a well made horror film, then you may wish swipe right again on your Apple TV remote.As I've said, because our lead is a man in a white sheet with no voice, I was amazed at how the film still managed to give the audience plenty of information so they can understand what's going on. The lack of dialogue from C made me felt that I too was watching life from the side line, perhaps a little bit like Ghost. Despite it sounding impossible to film, director David Lowery has managed to pull it off.The film also provided an unsettling audio track (this is a good thing) which is consist and timed well. So many times the basic music was able to build suspense or worse, make you feel alone.I should note too, A Ghost Story's aspect ratio is a 4:3 (square box styled format). This was on purpose and again helped with the film's tone and feeling. That's right- this film does not playback in full screen.Overall this is a film that has taken risks and delivers something very creative, fresh and different. While this film may frustrate some with its long paced shots, the journey here is well worth it and the film's ending does feels rather satisfying.8.8/10

83,trublu215,"A Bold, Powerful and Beautiful Film",8,2 July 2017,"A Ghost Story marks David Lowry's return to cinema since his 2013 indie hit ""Ain't Them Bodies Saints"". Telling the story of a young couple (Casey Affleck and Rooney Mara) who buy a home and plan to start a life together in it until tragedy strikes. The Man suddenly dies and leaves the wife to fend for herself and build a life in the house by herself instead of with the man she loves. All while she is going through this in reality, the Man begins to haunt the home in a classical white sheet donning way. Throughout the years of being trapped to haunt this home, The Ghost also has to witness the love of his past life continue on without him and experience the moments of life without him. It is a beautiful and heart wrenching film that delves deeper into what grief does to not only a person but to a ghost.Whether you believe in an after life or not, A Ghost Story isn't worried about your beliefs. It plays out like a fantasy and that's how it stays which really bodes well for it. It never reaches beyond what is happening with the Man and the Woman and, of course, the House (which becomes a character in and of itself). David Lowry does a great job at setting up a ""what if"" scenario that all you can do is ask yourself, ""what would I do in this situation?"" The scariest part of that is there is literally nothing you can do. That rationalization is probably scarier than most horror films out today. The film itself is a very digestible 90 minutes which is of a perfect length for this film because it doesn't go overboard and forget what it is. It's a horror film that is light on scares but heavy on thoughts and brains. There's no real scares. The big scare is putting yourself in the shoes of the ghost. What would you do if you had to witness your loved one go through grief and you couldn't do anything about it? You couldn't comfort them. You couldn't hold them. You could just watch. What if the person you loved moved on from you? What if they forget you? These questions are what made A Ghost Story scary for me. The level of helplessness that the film portrays is horrifying enough to remind audiences that death is still scary.Overall, the film is an experimental ghost story that shows Lowry in top form both as a writer and a director. The crass nature of reality is that death is lonely and he captures that perfectly. While many who take a look at the poster will certainly think that the film is just another horror movie trying to capitalize on some paranormal money, A Ghost Story is much more than that. It is beautiful to watch, heart wrenching to experience and an absolute delight cinematically.",A Ghost Story

It takes you on a unique journey to make some compelling points on our finite existence and the vanity of pursuing a legacy. It's one shortcoming exists in the deliberately sluggish pacing. It is clearly the intention of the filmmaker to draw out certain mundanities to the edge of good taste, which makes the decision forgivable, yet no less difficult to sit through. Nevertheless, the strong performances, awe inspiring score and clever storytelling add up to a beautifully melancholy experience.",A Ghost Story
86,TheVictoriousV,A movie about life - and everything else,10,12 April 2019,"A Ghost Story is the sort of film best enjoyed without any prior knowledge of what exactly it is and what exactly one might take from it (read this at your own risk). I am scarcely alone in being baffled that a movie about a guy in a sheet - such a simple and instantly, even humorously familiar visual - could be about so many things and say so much (while mostly being completely quiet).David Lowery writes and directs this particular ghost story, which also happens to be one of love, grief, man's ultimate ""longevity"", even time travel to an extent. We see it all (and I do mean it all) through the eyes of C (Casey Affleck), a bearded musician who perishes in a car accident and leaves behind his grieving wife M (Rooney Mara) in the Texas-based country house where they built most of their relationship.On the day of his death, C rises from the morgue, covered by a sheet of fabric with dark holes for the eyes. He returns to the house; M is still there; she can't see him. As days and weeks pass at an increasingly accelerated pace (conveyed brilliantly through the editing in ways I won't try to explain), M ultimately lets go and abandons the building. C, however, does neither. Time continues to move. Other people move through the house as C still wanders between its walls, waiting for M to come back, even as the spot begins to change.The film's depth and scope defy its simplicity, just as much in its heavy themes as its performances. Very rarely do we see Affleck's real face, nor does he speak much; he is mainly forced to emote through the ghost sheet, just by moving his head, assuming certain postures, or just staring at that which he can no longer reach. It works so much better than it ought to - one critic theorized that it is because watching C's ghost is rather like playing with dolls; we project more easily onto (literal) blank slates, and using one such character as the focalizer of such an all-encompassing tale about life on Earth may explain the film's power.I should praise the film on a technical level, as well. The music by Daniel Hart is a perfect fit for the story, images, and themes, and Andrew Droz Falermo's photography can only be described as beautiful - most notably in scenes where the ghost takes its most significant steps.What else can I say? Mara does tremendously well, the unusual aspect-ration adds an appropriate sense of claustrophobia, I've already mentioned the editing (in terms of how the protagonist experiences time), and the funniest thing about the costume might be the fact that it was apparently very hard to make. Turns out there aren't that many sheets that will cover a grown adult's entire body.A Ghost Story is not for everyone (even though it is, but you know what I mean). Some of it will be too slow to people's liking, no matter how purposeful and effective it is, and in spite (yet again) of the image on the poster, it is a damningly original film - hardly the sort of thing that gets the average audience excited. As irksome to admit as it is, ""nobody has made this film yet"" is not a succesful sale's pitch. But hey, Kesha is in it for two seconds!It is possible I've said too much; it is equally possible I haven't even started. This is a film you need to see in part because it is beautifully done, and in larger part because of the thoughts and conversations it may inspire.One of the best scenes involves a drunken party guest (Will Oldham) giving a lengthy speech about how any human being's attempt to immortalize themselves, be it through the art we create or the offspring we desperately try to produce, is ultimately futile; as it happens, the Universe and its mechanisms care very little for how badly you want to be remembered, loved, or what-have-you. Whether or not the film, judging by the inclusion of C's time-and-space-defiant situation, ultimately agrees with this man, I cannot tell you yet (I plan to see it a second time). All I know is that this prospect, that there's no point in our incessant striving, will worry many and inspire others to maybe not worry so much.",A Ghost Story

It's 90 minutes of practically zero action and a lot of drama, with very short dialogues and a monologue that is the scene with most lines and with someone actually speaking (4 minutes, more or less, I think). It is an unusual approach to how to deal with death and grief, and how loneliness can overcome all barriers, even time. It is not for everyone, it has boring moments that can make the viewer give up in the first 20 min, but I believe that the final message is well worth the time spent watching this film. The photography is very well conceived, and is a good example for the famous phrase ""a picture is worth a thousand words"". The score has some beautiful moments as well.",A Ghost Story
88,mr_bickle_the_pickle,Haunting....but not in a scary way,8,26 January 2018,"Its a very beautiful movie that explores themes of what it means to be human, the meaning if life etc. It is a bit of slow burn. I think particularly because of the way its shot at times. There are numerous scenes where the camera will linger on a person or object for a minute or more while nothing happens. So I understand for some people that it might make it a very boring viewing experience. There also isnt a lot of dialogue as it many follows the deceased husband. So that also may be frustrating to some people. I think for the most part it works. But there were some moments where I personally felt like it could have been trimmed down. Like with the infamous pie scene, I think seeing Rooney sink down to the floor with the whole pie in her hands and dig it into was enough to convey the message they were going for, without actually having to show Rooney the entire thing. In terms of plot, there was a twist if you will, that I expected to happen and did. But, I wouldnt say that the film was completely predictable. There were some things that I kept guessing about. It also is beautifully shot. Goregous cinematography. Particularly this shot of the ghost walking through the meadow. The performances were good, but I dont know if I can say outstanding, since again the movie mainly follows the ghost and hes obstructed by the sheet. The film definitely relies more on visual imagery to elicit a feeling than it does necessarily through the actors.Its a very interesting way to tell this story. But it is very much art-housey and if thats not your thing, I dont know if this movie is for you.",A Ghost Story

The only spoken dialogue a person can actually clearly hear in the whole movie is completely wrong in its ""deep meaning"", jayzus.The stuff with ghosty going forward in time, then backward in time was completely pointless and inexplicable. I guess the happy viewers tie this in with destiny of the universe for a ""deeper"" meaning.Highly overrated",A Ghost Story
90,Jared_Andrews,It's 30% Deeply Moving and 70% Deeply Boring,6,28 September 2017,"If you prefer a movie rich with dialogue, A Ghost Story is not for you.There is very little speaking throughout the movie. Only one scene features much talking and it's not even a conversation. One man launches into a lengthy, detailed monologue about the infinite size of the universe and our relative insignificance within it. The man believes that the speech is profound and laudable, but in reality it sounds like something a college kid would say while high at a party.The gist of the man's speech expresses that the universe is too vast for any of us to truly leave a legacy when we die. The ghost (played by Casey Affleck) is especially compelled by this speech because he has just died and is now especially compelled by things concerning his legacy.The ghost observes what he cared about most while he was alive. He haunts his house. He observes his wife, struggling to watch her struggle to cope with his death. He wants desperately to comfort her, but cannot. It's heartbreaking.In addition to heartbreak, this movie evokes many other feelings: warmth, humor, boredom. Boredom comes up a lot. For every genuinely beautiful and moving moment of the movie, there is at least five minutes of emptiness. The runtime is short, just over 90 minutes, but it feels longer and could easily have been trimmed by 20 minutes.One scene in particular that involves a pie seems to drag on for at least four days, even though it actually only lasts four minutes. In the moment, the scene is likely unbearable to many viewers. I plead for your patience. Do your best to empathize. Think about how you would feel in the situation. Do this, and the scene becomes haunting and powerful.That's probably the best way to sum up the movie—many scenes may feel boring if given little thought, but are actually deeply moving if given honest consideration. Not all scenes fit this description—some, no matter how much your squint, are just extended moments of vapid emptiness. The emptiness outnumbers the deeply moving by about 2:1, so this movie requires patience and commitment. The movie contains no conflict, only contemplation and some glorious music.If that sounds like enough for you, give this movie a chance.

93,gengar843,Minimalist Existential Ghost Story,8,14 May 2018,"A ghost desires nothing more than to know what his left-behind wife has written on a sliver of paper and hidden behind a wall. We follow first Casey Affleck alive, then his white-sheeted spirit as it lives through the history of the home where he died (albeit outside). The journey time-jumps with some overlapping imagery, and mixes in existential philosophy. The film does a good job with the thin material, padding many scenes with slow camera shots, moody music, and one long nihilistic monologue from a drunk party-goer who hasn't a clue a ghost is listening to him. This is actually the most intriguing aspect of the film, that ghosts may be with us at any time. There is explanation for poltergeist activity, self-haunting, and even multi-dimensional haunting and time travel. It's all done very quietly, without much fanfare, which is quite unique. Even the sentimental aspects are blunted by stone-faced lead Mara and the sad-eyed sheet. One must believe all this is intentional, to accentuate whatever subtle depth the writer and director intended over more common themes.That said, the film lacks the intellectual prowess to push the viewer beyond merely being led down the garden path. The ghost's emotional range is mostly one-dimensional, and no great revelation is extended. As if understanding this, or perhaps intentionally planning it so, the ending is a question mark rather than the period which the audience sorely deserved. Some may argue that ""the answer"" would have ruined the melancholy mood, but I think it's just that the creators had no adequate answer, drunk monologue notwithstanding.This movie *will* make you think, and possibly cry, so I give it a solid 7-8 for that ,and for the effort into keeping this minimalist.",A Ghost Story

All in all I didn't dislike it, though I'd never sit through it again and I can only think of one person I know who might like it. An unusual 90 minutes.

95,Irie212,What is the boldest aspect of this exceptional movie?,8,1 August 2017,"Making this film was an act of courage by David Lowery, and he has delivered a film that proves his worth as a true auteur, an artist to keep an eye on. The plot is simple yet ambitious: M (Rooney Mara) and C (Casey Affleck) live in a modest bungalow. After he is killed in a car accident, she returns home-- and so does he, as a ghost who rises up from a slab in the morgue wearing the sheet he was covered with (a powerful image and idea). Time passes, but he stays even after she moves away, haunting the property far into the future as well as the past, as far back as when the first white settlers arrive, and then forward again to the present, when he watches himself and M move in. This is not a conventional movie in any way. The bold strokes include:The costume. The special effect here isn't computer-generated, it's a sheet thrown over C-- but this isn't your standard white percale. This sheet has a poetic quality, the weight of it, the way it drapes and drags along after him. The eye holes are black, and they look increasingly frayed and expressive in broad fabric that stretches over the face like an immortal skin. In itself, the costume is a work of art.The dialogue. Most of the movie is silent. The conversation between M and C is sparse and enigmatic, but it suggests trouble in their relationship. The family who takes over the house after M leaves is is Spanish-speaking. The only real speech in the film occurs with the next inhabitants, who throw a party which is dominated by a pedantic nihilist (Will Oldham) who holds forth about the meaning of Beethoven's 9th Symphony, or any art, given that the Sun will eventually become a red giant. It's a monologue that the ghost of C listens to, and when it ends, the lights flicker, which is one of the ways C makes himself known. But it amounts to nothing. The next scene, the house is empty again, except for C's ghost. The music. The score by composer Daniel Hart reflects the changing mood of the story with as much variety as any film I can recall. The word, of course, is haunting.The love story. Frankly, there isn't one. You can try to read one into it, but M and C seem to be on the rocks, based on the scraps of dialogue we get. When he's killed, she doesn't break down at the morgue, she just asks for a few minutes alone. Her emotional response, however, is palpable in another scene. A female Realtor has left her a note (half sympathy, half business) with a pie. M reads the note, tosses it (pausing for 2nd thoughts), and then eats the entire pie in a single go, filmed with two camera shots, first with her standing in the kitchen, then sitting on the floor and eating forkful after forkful. It is a powerful scene if you give yourself over to it. There's a pie. Food. What do you do with food? You eat it and when you're in a state where you don't want to think, where you're overwhelmed by loss and set adrift in sudden solitude, you just take cues from what's in front of you. A pie. Eat.The pace. This is a slow movie, and I mean s l o w. I was ready to walk out after the first 10 minutes of stationary camera shots, but I soon realized that what I was watching was the deliberate work of a brave and visionary (if not yet masterful) filmmaker.There are more details to be discovered and contemplated when you see the film. Among them, the ghost occupying the neighboring house, whose decorated sheet seems to be from a child's bed. The kinetic bursts of action by C as a ghost, when he's disturbed. And there are oddities, which unfortunately don't add anything but confusion to an already mysterious story, e.g., C occupying the same space as his ghost, and a scene where the ghost observes himself as a ghost. Etc. And, finally, there are the two scribbled notes-- one secreted away by M in a door jamb, another left under a rock by a pioneer girl-- which we never get to see or read. They remain unknown, a frustration we are left with. And that, the Unknowable, is what ""A Ghost Story"" asks us to come to terms with.",A Ghost Story

While Lowery's ultimate lost love story comes across, getting there (1 hour 32 minutes) is painstakingly long. If Affleck got paid to be under that ghost sheet the entire time, he scored. If a stand-in stood in for all those scenes, he scored, and while Mara is pleasant to watch, a viewer can only be expected to watch nothing for so long. However, in every production there is always some light, and here it comes in the haunting music by Daniel Hart, the captivating ""evolution/destruction of man"" monologue by houseguest (Will Oldham), and Lowery's ability (tedious as it was) to set the stage for mystery.

But they only feel that way during the time you are first watching them. After finishing the film and reflecting on these same scenes, they take on a new elegance that wasn't there before.

To describe the ghost's psychology in this journey might be giving away too much. The plot is straightforward but it addresses themes of human existence and eternity in a way that many big-budget films don't even try.The ghost's simplistic form might seem odd or laughable at first. This was not the case with me. I found the ghost's emergence and entry into the film to be seamless and thoroughly convincing. The narrative initially dissects local aspects of the plot, such as what type of relationship the man had with his wife and who he seemed to be as a person. Then it proceeds to become something much more ambitious- waxing philosophical on how we spend our time on Earth and what meaning, if any, we should hope to derive from it. The film's augmentation in scope can be risky for a small, unpretentious work, but in the end, it resonates quite well.As for the performances, everyone here is great but Rooney Mara is exceptionally understated here, not the least for the scene where she eats an entire pie in a moment of intense pain. She is able to convey the grave reality of mourning without ever resorting to histrionics or conventional acting displays. She is low-key and completely effective here, as is Casey Affleck who portrays the detached husband. They worked with director Lowery in the lesser film ""Ain't Them Bodies Saints"", but here their collaboration reaches greater heights.As simple as this ghost appears, there is never a dearth of sympathy or doubt about its presence. The film's uses of long takes and pregnant silence create an unexpected degree of tension. It deploys a soundtrack that is alternately mournful and quirky. And for all the melancholy mood that pervades, there are discreet moments of humor, making for a bittersweet cinematic work of art. Strongly recommended.",A Ghost Story
99,rutzelb,"It's Kind of Okay, Not Scary",5,26 October 2017,"The Ghost (Casey Affleck) returns to his home and watches his loved one grieve for him and he will try to connect with his wife (Rooney Mara), but cannot. (Good luck with that. Hey, Houdini couldn't do it)Normally, I stay away from horror or scary movies – hey I want to sleep peacefully - but I had an feeling that this would not be the case here. And, of course, I was right. ('bout time) Here's the thing: there is hardly any dialogue, no action at all, the Ghost just stands by and watches his wife kind of grieve and we have no real insight to her grieving except for one scene where she eats a pie for 4+ actual literal minutes. I think the idea of the movie is to allow us time to think about death, grieving and all that. A scene can last up to 3 –minutes or more without anything happening except for the Ghost watching: his wife alone without him, his wife bringing home a lover, I guess ; a family with kids when he throws plates to let the family know the house is haunted and they leave; a party in the house when a man tells of the absurdness of everything because all will end and no one will be remembered for anything; the destruction of the house; the building of a high-rise office building where the house was; a pioneer family on the plains killed by Indians (not sure what this scene was all about except it was the place the house was originally built); and to finish off the Loop, we see him and his wife move into the house as in the beginning of all this before his death, which was a car accident not far from the house. We see the wife move out of the house to move forward with her life, but the Ghost doesn't move with her, but stays with the house. We thought something would happen when the Ghost sees another Ghost in the house next door, but nothing happens and we only learn that the other Ghost is female (flowered sheet, you see) and she says she is waiting, but has forgotten for whom she is waiting. We also thought something would help explain things when the Ghost tries to retrieve a paper his wife wrote something on and placed it in a wall and painted over it. But we are not privy to what she wrote when the Ghost reads it. The note wasn't for him. Again, the Ghost wants to communicate but cannot. I still think the slowness of all scenes after the death are meant for us to reflect on our mortality and others too although there is no following the wife to understand her grief. We kind of got the feeling there is nothing more she can do , but try to get on with her life as she leaves the house. I suppose we should all reflect upon our mortality and how death will also affect others too, so if you feel the need to reflect, then watch this movie . Otherwise skip it. Life is too short to be so involved about death and the consequences thereof. (Is thereof a word?)The music is appropriate for the scenes we see. The acting is good for the story (Is Casey Affleck really under that sheet?) I do not see any Oscar Awards in this. Maybe the title should have been Reflections as we are given really too much time to reflect on death and consequences thereof. (there it is again) You may have to ask yourself if you were overwhelmed by this movie. I was, kinda. (5/10)Violence: Plates being thrown only. We do not see the car accident. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Only one F-bomb was heard. .No soft stuff.",A Ghost Story
100,bastille-852-731547,"Uniquely Thoughtful, Experimental Cinema",8,11 July 2017,"This Sundance Film Festival hit tells the story of a couple, played by Rooney Mara and Casey Affleck. After Affleck's character is killed in a car accident, his ghost comes to life (portrayed as simply a white sheet.) The film uses its seemingly simple plot to be a thoughtful meditation on time and our lives. While the film is slowly paced and there is no doubt that mainstream audiences would likely be bored, those with the patience to watch and absorb the unique details and themes presented in this film will be greatly rewarded. The film's simplicity is one of its strongest assets as well. Even a simple scene of Rooney Mara's character eating pie for several minutes turns out to be an emotional powerhouse that is incredibly effective at creating a sense of empathy in the audience. A unique score also creates feelings of both sorrow and, occasionally, tension among the audience as well. It ends up contributing to the meditative feeling of the film, which may remind viewers of some of Terrence Malick's more recent films (in a very, very good way.)My only real criticism of the film was that it could have done a better job making the audience feel more for the ghost character. Additionally, while I liked the score overall, there were a few moments where it felt a little out of place. But other than that, this is a truly original piece of film that shows that in the world of independent filmmaking, sometimes 'less is more.' While I like a good blockbuster as much as anyone, it really--and undeniably--is great to see such an interesting movie that did not need a big budget to make. Definitely recommended. 8/10",A Ghost Story
101,quinimdb,A Ghost Story,8,14 October 2017,"Rarely does a movie with such a large scale, some scenes being hundreds of years apart, feel so intimate. But ""A Ghost Story"" is not a traditional film in any sense. It's probably the only movie about a ghost that I've seen that isn't a horror movie. The main character (only credited as ""C"") is only alive for a few scenes, then spends the rest of the film in complete silence draped under a white sheet. Time isn't constrained in any way, many scenes take place in one, long, silent, static shot, and in many scenes C stands in one place as time around him moves and his surroundings change. Yet despite C being passive by nature throughout the majority of the film, he remains a character who has desires and motives and reacts to the things around him. The title says it all - it's a ghost's story, from his perspective.The relationship between C (Casey Affleck) and M (Rooney Mara) is tested as they are moving out of their home. Then suddenly and off- screen, C dies. How he dies is irrelevant, hence not showing it in the film. What this film is about is what happens after his death.M's grief is still a part of the movie, and M is always in the foreground of what C is seeking, but the only common thread throughout the entire film is the location and the ghost. Now, I realize how strange and cliché it may seem for the representation of a ghost to literally just be a man with sheets draped over him, especially in such a serious film, but somehow the film is able to be somewhat self aware about using this goofy horror trope while not sacrificing its tone, clearly referencing certain ghost story clichés while putting an entirely different, poignant spin on it.The film's unusual square aspect ratio with rounded corners, almost gives it the appearance of an old home movie, giving this cosmic, thought provoking film a nostalgic, and personal feel. As time in the film is relative to C, all the editing feels very deliberate, apparently even mentioning shot lengths in the script. The soundtrack is used sparingly, but adds an entire new level of emotion to the scenes it is used in, even playing a direct role in the story.In the middle of the film, a man at a party delivers a long, passionate, and somewhat rambling rant about the ultimate meaninglessness of human life. It's an entrancing monologue, as everyone in the party slowly gathers near him, and for a while it seemed as if this nihilistic outlook was the point of the movie. And don't get me wrong, everything he says is true and nothing in the movie contradicts its validity, but what I failed to realize was how quickly everyone around him goes back to partying and having fun, despite this existential realization. Even though all human life and remnants of it will be completely gone and there probably won't be much closure, moments can't be erased from existence, and if you realize that then every moment of existence means something.",A Ghost Story
102,magnuslhad,empty,2,14 August 2017,"A young man dies and returns as a ghost to silently observe and occupy the home he once lived in. Time passes, his widow moves out, but the ghost waits. Very early in this film you notice how stunning the cinematography is, a sure sign that the story is lacking in depth. There are hints of Terence Malick's 'The Tree of Life' here, and some of The Time Machine's ideas on the non-linearity of time. But the film offers nothing substantial or insightful. Long takes force us to engage for uncomfortably extended periods with one frame, but there is nothing especially thought-provoking or insightful on offer. A woman gorging herself on pie is an especially egregious example, a scene that was the trigger for the series of walk-outs that took place at the art-house cinema in Scotland where I watched this. A party bore offers up a vacuous speech on the fragility and indeterminacy of existence that a literature undergrad would blush at, never mind a middle-aged man. The main content of conversation post-viewing was whether this scene or the pie-eating was more tedious. A ghost that can walk through walls spends literally an eternity trying to fish a piece of paper out of a wall. The film has one of those ambiguous endings that is the calling card kop-out of the art-house poseur filmmaker. It is beautifully filmed, exquisitely so, but it is scant compensation for the trite storytelling.",A Ghost Story
103,danielharden,In The End does it matter?,9,3 August 2017,"A24 have started to make a name for itself on the low budget, indie movie scene, distributing such great and ambitious films as; The Lobster, Moonlight, Swiss Army Man and Enemy. A Ghost Story is their latest ambitious effort, starring Casey Affleck and Rooney Mara, and written and directed by David Lowery. Just two days after he had finished the Disney Blockbuster, Pete's Dragon, director David Lowery began shooting A Ghost Story, in secret for an absolute fraction of the price of the live action, Disney feature. The film tells the story of a couple, C and M, living in their suburban home, until one day C, played by Casey Affleck, dies in a car crash and proceeds to haunt/ watch over M, played by Rooney Mara, and their house as a Ghost. If you know anything about this film, you will know that Ghost in this film is dressed as you would a child, last minute for Halloween, some might call it its 'gimmick'. However, similar to many of A24's ambitious work, A Ghost Story does not solely rest on this surreal image, the film takes something that even the director found laughable, and turns it into something emotionally profound and extremely thought provoking. A Ghost Story is an unconventional gem.When you hear 'A Ghost Story' do not expect a horror film, because you will be disappointed. A Ghost Story does play with certain horror traits such as; flickering lights and bumps in the night, but in a way the subverts our understanding of horror films Does a supernatural being have to be malevolent? No, it could just be frustrated, confused and/or lost, and that is just one small way that A Ghost Story excellently subverts expectation to provoke discussion. As I have said, A Ghost story is not a horror film, it is an unconventional drama that explores emotional and thought provoking themes such as; grief, time, space, existence and its meaning, or lack there of.Another way in which the director, David Lowery is experimental, is with his use of shot duration. Lowery, having come from an editing background in film, as well as, being inspired by the use of long shot duration's in European and Asian cinema, has taken the long take to the extreme. Shots linger for minutes at a time to the point were, as Lowery himself stated, you forget you are expecting something to happen. There is a 9 minute scene of Rooney Mara eating an entire pie and vomiting it back up That is all you need to know about how long Lowery lets the camera roll for. The use of long take is great as it does feel like you are watching life happen, due to the unedited nature of those shots, and it really does make for a truly unconventional film. I can however see some people getting bored and giving up on this film, due to this technique being heavily used in the films first act, but I do urge those people to please give the film the whole 90 minutes, as it is definitely worth your time.Now whilst on the subject of time As well as having extremely long takes, this film also has pretty much every kind of cut you can think of, fast cuts, jump cuts, cuts to flashback, intercuts, elliptical cuts spanning years, decades and even centuries, the list goes on. This film is about time and how it waits for no one, even when we die time keeps on going, and Lowery has excellently used editing to illustrate this and play with time. He has said that he believes it is time, and the editing of time, that makes film stand out as an art form. Lowery's editing is seamless and complex as he manipulates time in a varying number of ways throughout the film. My personal favourite instance of Lowery's time manipulation is C's song scene, Lowery intercuts between a warmly lit flashback and a dull and cold looking present as C's song plays in both shots. Plus the added proxemics between M and the Ghost makes for a deeply emotional scene that hit me hard.The entire film is best summed up in the films final act, with a series of elliptical jump cuts involving a little girl. This was perhaps Lowery's best use of editing and direction in the film, as it so perfectly, and rather cynically, explores its main theme of the film; does anything matter? We all die eventually, and our aim seems to be, to create something that will outlive us, but that will surely die too right? Maybe someday soon or far in the future when the world is nothing but a wasteland. And so we have gone full circle and ask again. Does it matter? As everything dies in the end, but also the Ghost sees all, it lives on so in a way things do matter don't they? It's an ongoing debate that A Ghost Story sophisticatedly explores, the answer is entirely subjective to the individual audience member.A Ghost Story is a emotional, extremely thought provoking and unconventional movie that people have to experience for themselves. With excellent writing, editing and directing from David Lowery this film will leave you utterly speechless. The film takes its 'gimmick' and makes you sympathise with it as you watch the Ghost yearn for the the business and people it's left behind. Beautifully shot by Andrew Droz Palermo and with a home movie styled aspect ratio that further elevates the Ghost's feeling of entrapment, A Ghost Story is a work of art that I truly hope means something in the long haul",A Ghost Story

Rather than having a pace that moves things along, its timing is such that it forces you to take things on an intellectual level. On a second viewing a few months later, I liked it better than the first time. With my personal life experience - living in the States and living in developing African nations under sometimes extreme and sometimes dangerous conditions - I gained a perspective that makes me think in terms of generations rather than months or years. In places where live has existed from the beginning yet left virtually nothing behind whatsoever, a place can be imprinted with a spirit or whatever - that which takes the place of structures and artifacts. On this level, I appreciate the filmaker's vision. While I find the pontificator to be rather purile and primitive, at least there is someone in the story who represents the average thinking person. Of course, the one who truly grasps the deeper meanings is the wife, who sums up the entire thing in her note to her husband.
For those who have the patience and who are willing to detach themselves from their busy little realities, this can be a very meaningful film. It's a great vehicle for Casey Affleck. But it's not a good one for the tunnel-visioned.",A Ghost Story

109,barbagvido,Almost a masterpiece,9,28 November 2017,"A Ghost Story is a movie about a man who dies and leaves his wife behind but comes back as a ghost under a sheet, silently observing the aftermath of his death. It's directed by David Lowery (Pete's Dragon) and stars Casey Affleck and Rooney Mara.It's very odd, but I like odd movies and if you like that too, you're in for a treat here. They can actually come across as a pretty nice refreshment from blockbusters and blockbusters can sometimes help as a break from art-house so I love keeping that balance, I enjoy both equally. These kinds of movies mostly stick with me more though and if you are looking for some food for thought, this is exactly what you need. There are more movies like that this year, but alongside mother! this is one of the better ones. From the very beginning, you can tell you are witnessing something unique. The premise isn't really unlike anything we've seen before, but the way it's done is. It's so slow, a lot will probably think at times it's too slow, but it sells for me because it adds up to a haunting atmosphere and later to a feeling of grief. It's filled with symbolisms while not just throwing them at you all the time, but it has that one exposition scene that should have been more subtle. I don't think it shouldn't have been there, I think it was necessary to highlight the themes of this movie, but it went on for too long and too much into details, so it felt a bit forced and out of place. Ghe second act is the reason why I didn't think it was perfect. The first act is so much heartbreak and grief done beautifully, but then it just doesn't go anywhere through the second act. It's not like nothing happens at all, it's just that there were too much unnecessary stuff that really didn't add to anything. If the second act was cut down a bit and the exposition scene wasn't so overused, it would be a perfect 10. This way, it stays at 9, but it doesn't really damage the movie too much. Third act, right after the exposition scene, is beautiful. I loved everything about the third act. Everything about it was pure beauty.Just, if the second act was any better, the movie itself would have been a lot better.

112,cappiethadog,Music of the spheres,8,20 November 2019,"The bedsheet doesn't have any holes in them. The ghost's eyes are representational. When C(Casey Affleck) wakes up in the morgue, the sheet that covers him is not the same linen he walks out of the hospital with. This is no child's Halloween costume. C didn't go into the bathroom with a pair of scissors. Those rounded apertures came with his apparitional body. This sheet exists on two different astral planes. In the spirit world, it's corporeal, but to the world of the living, the bedsheet is nothing more substantial than thin air. C walks past doctors and nurses, and patients, unnoticed. Only a ghost can see that wall at the end of the corridor transform into hot white light, a door to higher ground. C ignores it. Unlike Sam Wheat(Patrick Swayze) in Jerry Zucker's ""Ghost"", C wasn't shot in a dark alleyway by a paid assailant; he was a bad driver, or rather, he had the unfortunate luck of encountering a bad driver, that's all. There is no murder mystery to solve. ""A Ghost Story"", directed by David Lowery, could easily be called ""A Love Story"". C needs to see his ""Immortal Beloved"" again. It doesn't matter how many miles he has to walk.M(Rooney Mara) is the widow; a woman who sacrificed a lot by marrying an unsuccessful singer-songwriter. By default, M is the breadwinner. She doesn't make enough money like Sam, a banker, whose earning power made it possible to support an artist, his girlfriend Molly Jensen(Demi Moore), who could throw pottery and still live comfortably. Molly's grief was somewhat offset by her Manhattan apartment and the money Sam left behind, whereas M comes home to what C liked to call ""a house with history"", or to put it frankly, a dump. They were going to move before the fatal car accident. She hated this rundown Texas ranch house. With higher rent, more than likely, and this goes unsaid, is that C would have to quit his art and go find a real job. ""A Ghost Story"" has a European filmmaker's sensibility. In a bravura scene, M sits down, leaning against a kitchen cabinet door, and nearly consumes an entire chocolate pie, in one unbroken shot that almost hits the five-minute mark. C occupies the background, watching her, motionless, like a sentry, or a floor lamp. Patrick Swayze, may he rest in peace, gave Demi Moore a whole arsenal of longing looks, and always seemed on the verge of crying. Casey Affleck, on the other hand, is completely reliant on his costar, to fill in the moviegoer's mind, the dead husband's grief by Rooney Mara acting as a mirror. Her facial expressions are his facial expressions, too.Inevitably, M sees other men. She kisses one at the door. C knocks some books off the shelf, turning their home into a haunted house. But ""A Ghost Story"" isn't a horror movie. M knows when it's time to leave. In the bedroom, when C was still alive, he asked his wife why she moved around so much. She answered: ""Because I didn't have a choice."" In traditional haunted house movies, the people have a choice to leave, but it always takes them an inordinately long time. ""A Ghost Story"", however, rejects genre conventions. M can take a hint, as well as the Mexican family who moves in. The filmmaker repositions ""A Ghost Story"" from horror to slice-of-life. People don't put themselves in harm's way. For M, it's her emotional life that she defends, and for the Hispanic mother, it's the physical lives of her children she safeguards. The last tenant is nameless; he's a prognosticator.The prognosticator(Will Oldham) is a philosopher; he holds court at a small table of party guests, talking about art, God, and the end of the world. C eavesdrops with great interest. ""...all the best ones were written for God,"" the prognosticator says, in regard to works of art, especially symphonies, using Beethoven's Ninth as an example. Ludwig Van Beethoven wakes up one morning and realizes that God doesn't exist, the prognosticator speaks hypothetically; his music, he continues, is for people, not the spheres, ""so all the notes and harmonies that were intended to...supersede the flesh"" can be attributed to science. This saddens Beethoven; he'd rather be God's vessel. The prognosticator's words will come back to haunt C. After outliving the bulldozed house, he commits suicide by jumping off a skyscraper that was built on the very same property where he lived in relative squalor with M. As a result, the holy ghost returns him to the beginning; not of time, but the time of the house, when that first stake was driven into the soil by some early-19th century pilgrim. Maybe this is hell. It's a sin to take your own life. It's his punishment. C loved that Texas ranch house more than M. A covered wagon pulled by horses stop. The man who claimed this borrowed land as his own brought the family. He has a little girl. The child hums a melody. It's his song. No, it's her song. The prognosticator was right. Beethoven's Ninth wasn't written in vain. God heard it. God also heard C's song. As punishment for prioritizing a career in music over M, he shows C how derivative his art is. For the next two-hundred years, the ghost has to stay rooted in that spot, contemplating his irrelevance. A songwriter writes a song because he hopes that ""this is something they'll remember me for"". C is remembering the little girl. Who will remember M?The ghost transcends the time continuum; he watches his former self with M, newlyweds with their whole lives ahead of them, being shown the house by Linda(Liz Frankie), a realtor. C and M were awoken one night by a crashing piano sound. The burst of cacophony was the ghost's doing. The ghost remembers chastising M for moving the piano, a tuned piano she probably untuned. C hates that piano now. He was no Beethoven, not even The Righteous Brothers. In ""Ghost"", an orchestral version of ""Unchained Melody"" plays as Sam Wheat says goodbye to his beloved. It sounds just like heaven.As a child, M would write ""old rhymes and poems"" on a small slip of paper whenever she left a house. Something about the place she loved. It's no different with the Texas ranch house, a home she shared with her husband, as a widowed adult, when C crashes his car again; dies again. This time, C rushes to the crevice where she left her scribbled message. Whatever it was, the words help with C's ascension. The occupied sheet falls to the ground. My best guess: It's a couplet from the song C wrote for M. What he loved about the house was M.""Are you running late/Did you sleep too much?""",A Ghost Story

David Lowery expressing a metaphorical truth that isn't life actually a ""Ghost Story"".If Emmanuel Lubezki was the cinematographer of this film, you would be convinced you were watching a work of Terrance Malick in its mystical art form. Funny enough there is a lot of The Tree of Life echoed as well as Shyamalan's The Sixth Sense. This is a very haunting piece of cinematic art, which from the outset is creepy, but becomes much more in its message and values on legacy and life.Affleck under the sheet is our main protagonist, although with no visible facial performance shown, there is much emotional character brought forth through Affleck's physical movement. Through the sudden shoulder turns and slow waking brings the moving spirit alive. The very eyes of the ghost exhibit this lonely soul, and its in fact very hard to accept that there is an actor under the sheet.Rooney Mara isn't my favourite screen presence, as her lack of happy expression seems to follow her in her different roles, however now A Ghost Story seems to be the role where her expressions are most comfortable. Maybe Marr's frequent melancholy performance has been a ghost of the future preparing her for this role (no offence Marr).Andrew Droz Palermo's cinematography is additionally very evocative, adding much grey shade and ghostly life to the film. Most sequences bring a solitary but staring gaze from the audience to the screen. Every small insignificant sound effect adds even more temperament to the couple's house.A Ghost Story is a daunting piece of cinema, and if understood in one way may show David Lowery's pessimistic view of the world, but not completely to be saddened by but also admire with its quiet and metrical apparition. 9.0/10",A Ghost Story
115,youthandyoungmanhood,Interesting,6,4 August 2018,"This film will split viewers, some people will like it and some will Hate it. I have fallen in the middle. The scene at that start with the pie drove me crazy, simply no need for it to be that long. This film is extremely slow with very little dialogue. The story is pretty good and you do feel the pain of the couple involved. Overall it's far from perfect but it is worth watching.",A Ghost Story
116,RMurray847,"A brooding, haunting meditation on love, life & time. You might love it, or you might be ready to gouge your eyes out!",7,8 January 2021,"Tough movie! Tough to describe. Sometimes tough to watch. It's certainly unique. No lack of creativity. And it casts a spell, but it's a very slow one. The first half of its roughly 90 minute runtime requires some serious patience...some trust that this is all leading somewhere.If you've not seen a trailer for the movie, then this paragraph might be considered a spoiler...in fact, all the rest of this review could be. But if you've seen the previews, then you know this much: a couple (Casey Affleck & Rooney Mara) live in a humble, lower-middle class American home. The husband dies, leaving behind a ghost (which is portrayed with surprising effectiveness by simply draping the actor in a white sheet with holes cut out for eyes...amusing at first, haunting...pun intended...later). The wife eventually packs up the place and moves out, leaving the ghost behind. Why does the ghost stay? What is he seeing and thinking? What is he hoping for?I truly can't say much more, because while the questions aren't answered 100%, they are the crux of the film and its meaning...such as you can glean. It's a movie of moods, mostly melancholy. But it is SLOOOOOOW. Oh, so amazingly SLOOOOOOWWWWW. Here's an example, perhaps the most extreme. Shortly after her husband dies, Mara returns to her home one afternoon. Her real estate agent has left behind a note and a pie. Mara eats the pie. Almost all of it. This takes, easily, 5 minutes. We watch. In the background, the ghost watches. Yes, we get to see lots of emotions playing out on her face...but it's also almost maddening to watch. We don't see things like this in movies. But it's very real...it feels very much like we're peeking in on a very private moment...just like the ghost is. Frankly, you either have to go with this film and its glacial pace...or likely just give up altogether. Later in the film, things begin to speed up a bit and pieces begin to click together a little bit. There are lovely images throughout. The ghost, on whom I suppose we are projecting feelings, is in turn sad, wise, angry, peevish, and maybe even a little funny. But mostly sad.Be ready for this film to make the leap from a very tiny, personal incident (the events in the lives of this non-descript couple) to something cosmic and a bit daring and amazing. I did not foresee quite what this film would do (in terms of plot)...nor did I expect, after the slow start, to find myself almost hypnotized by the movie. It haunts you, in a delicate, sneaky way. But in a way that will stick with you for quite some time. I daresay, in a few months, I may be ready to watch it again. It worked on me in unexpected ways, which I appreciated.I did have some gripes nonetheless. The sound mix on the dialogue was pretty bad. I know lots of the dialogue is meant to be merely suggested and the specific words aren't important. BUT, when we get interaction between Mara & Affleck...it should be easy to understand. But mumbled whispers needed some help. Instead, I was left wishing I had the closed caption device at my movie seat. Later, a character appears who embarks on a long explanation of a scientific/metaphysical principle (that's all I'll say). While interesting...it's almost the equivalent of having something spoon fed to us so that we'll understand later parts of the film. It's a device that for me was incredibly awkward and costs this film at least half a star.I really am very glad I saw the film. I've sure not seen anything quite like it. A brooding, haunting meditation on love, life & time. Wow...it takes on a lot, and it's tough to watch at times...but it gripped me. That's the sign of a pretty effective film.",A Ghost Story
117,ccamp89,Shoots for the stars,8,26 February 2018,"Shoots for the stars and although it doesn't quite reach them, the end product is memorable and, at times, profound. I enjoyed how the film tackled such ambitious, cosmic themes like humanity's futile search for meaning, the desire to leave a legacy, as well as the nature of time itself, all while telling a restrained and intimate story. The philosophical tone and emphasis on visual storytelling often reminded me of Terrence Malick, and the film offers up a plethora of striking and haunting images akin to what Malick goes for. Certain sequences in the film are phenomenal, while others are decidedly less so. One particular scene about midway through the film where a random party-goer (who otherwise has no setup or payoff in the story) gives a philosophizing monologue that touches on all the major themes of the film was a notable blemish. Prior to this point the film had already been successfully conveying these themes entirely visually and with great subtlety. By comparison, the monologue feels blunt, clumsy, and self-defeating given what the film had already accomplished. However aside from this moment and a few other minor shortcomings, the film is overall quite successful, unique, and thought provoking.Decent 4/5",A Ghost Story

I was hoping that the end may answer the questions but it really didn't. Everything about this movie is about to think that you are watching a piece of art but in reality it is nothing but a waste of time.

It was like living in a bad marriage for an hour and a half suffering through it all. The supposed ""a-ha!"" moment was not only predictable, we've all seen it several times before in other movies and once finally revealed was more of a groan producer than anything else.

121,I_should_be_reading_a_book,Haunting...,5,14 July 2020,"...but then, it's a ghost story, isn't it?I cannot in earnest give a higher rating than 5/10 but then I cannot rate it lower as it has a measure of merit. However, you will have to brace yourself to invest one and a half hour watching it closely to the very end and, when you reach it, ask yourself it it was worth all your time and attention.Please bear with me and I'll try to explain why without spoilers, although there's barely anything to reveal about.Cinematography is worthy, a good effort with finelely honed photography and editing.Plot, if you expect any you shall be severely disappointed; it's all a collage of touching scenes that really don't bind together but in the end it comes to be about time and emotion. In fact, every scene is a keystone to the end.Acting --and probably directing- is good, considering the almost complete absence of coherent plot and purpose. On the other hand, the film is emotive and gripping and -maybe- will keep you focused.Production is absolutely low budget but makes use of all the elements at hand, again considering the absence of a coherent plot.It manages to keep you interested in reaching a revealing end, sadly it's not there; even so, you will leave the screen touched by the film (in my case the computer, watching the Netflix version during the peak of the 2020 quarantine, late at night, which may explain my high 5/10 rating).My summary, if you can handle experimental filmmaking in the likes of Pi and Chaos, go for it. If you want to spend a good time at the movies, avoid it. Go read a book you have abandoned for a long time instead. In any case, it will become a trial of your attention, intelligence and acceptance of a different approach, something not unlike a Rorschach test.Oh, and it is truly haunting!",A Ghost Story

Whether it moves slowly or quickly might not matter if its a good story with good acting. Thats why its so ironic that this movie, about a dead person or two, has ZERO pacing. Just like death.. there you are. Except there WE are sitting in a theater or in a laz-y-boy recliner, wishing we were dead instead of watching this movie. Maybe we're in purgatory, waiting our turn.

123,nlytnd_1,Painfully slow repetitive ghost shots in an attempt to convey a message that is later revealed anyways.,5,3 September 2018,"Dude! Where does one begin. I understand it. I really, really do, but I still found myself punching myself in the sack for entertainment throughout this life is meaningless ordeal. Actually, how could you not understand it, the movie reveals everything through that guy who gives that spiel at the party. So, we have to endure all these long slow shots, to convey the message that they will later reveal anyways, then why put us through this drab, meaningless crap in the first place? Sure, it would still be painfully boring, but at least it would make sense if they didn't reveal it anyways.I appreciate independent films, I appreciate the extremely tiny budget of this movie and under different circumstances I appreciate long extended shots in movies when you have multiple variables that have to be perfect or else the shot doesn't work, however in this instance, how can you go wrong? It's the equivalent of pointing the camera, turning it on, then turning it off after 5 minutes or whatever. I'm not going to go back through to figure it out, but I'm curious what the running time is on just the extended ghost standing in place shots. It has to be 75% of the movie. Did they really need Casey Affleck for the ghost scenes or did they exercise the most utilized stand-ins in cinematic history? On this scene we're going to need you to stand in place for a reeeealllllllllllll f_kin long time. Someone must have heard Affleck say, do I really need to be here for this, can someone else stand here in place like a jackhole, I have other better paying gigs to work on. Casey, you have the perfect timing with the way you move in the sheets, so yes, we need you for this shot.The movie lacked emotion, which was the movies intent... everything felt drab, which was the movies intent.

This movie is about grief from the point of the deceased. In this movie, the dead grieve as hard as the living, but for longer, until they can find what will free them.CA dies within the first few minutes of the film, and we are aware of the mundane questions well-meaning people may ask, such as ""are you okay?"" after RM has just viewed her husband's body. His spirit follows her in his heartache and he returns to the house. He is not really wearing a sheet, but rather there had to be a way for viewers to see him, obviously. His emotions are captured in strange flashes of colored, pulsing lights. The hated pie scene was actually very important. It is subtle, but the flashing becomes more prominent as she devours the pie, and very noticeable by the time she throws up, as his heart breaks for his widow. New tenants move in and he becomes angry and successfully scares them away. The house eventually becomes a high-rise and he looks out over the city and sees millions of the colored, pulsing lights (easy to differentiate from other lights), and he realizes how many are like him, roaming the world, looking over their loved ones and powerless to communicate with them. It is only when RM has begun the healing process that she notices one of the lights. Any paranormal article will tell you that you will be much more receptive to the dead when you are in a calm state, not when you are in the throes of grief, so it was an important scene. The movie becomes very involved and there are other ghosts, but I have to say this is one of the most emotional movies I have ever seen. It is too beautiful to be missed. If you are grieving someone, take heart - this movie will probably make you feel better, not worse.",A Ghost Story

127,trevor-82944,A Mind-Bending Study on What's Left for Ourselves,7,28 July 2017,"The art house may not always be your go-to place for a good time out, particularly amidst the summer blockbuster season, but let me say: it often draws paths to the answers of whatever life questions you may regularly ponder. Although A Ghost Story falls into the category of ""love it or hate it,"" please know that it came from A24, the remarkable independent studio which brought us life-changing works about the inner human spirit, such as Ex Machina, Room, The Lobster, Swiss Army Man, and Moonlight. Now, they did it again with this almost silent film that exploits its tiny sixty-member cast and crew.The director/editor David Lowery (Pete's Dragon) has proved his mastery over both of his responsibilities; he follows what more experimental filmmakers do nowadays, and utilizes long uninterrupted shots to its greatest power. The camera seldom moves as it lingers on the small moments for an uncomfortable length of time—the moments he chooses to linger on supposedly communicate nothing, calling us to wait in anticipation.Lowery can truly make each frame tell its own story under its 4:3 aspect ratio, the corners rounded off, as if watching a hopeless widow's Instagram story. You could literally watch it on your phone for the compatibility of its visual style! He stated before how he ""wanted to make something small and tiny and handmade,"" (Filmmaker Magazine) and he well and beyond fulfills what he hinted at, as he creates such a cold environment inside the claustrophobic house the weary spirit refuses to leave. Especially in the large-scale moments, such as a walk in the grassy plain, Lowery keeps things as intimate as possible.The ghost's simple design intrigues the senses: the familiar white bedsheet with holes cut in for the eyes creates some hauntingly surreal imagery. Nobody can see him there under the sheets from his hospital deathbed other than us the spectators, turning the already unsettling vision of a white strolling figure all the more eerie.You can for certain love the accompanying musical score by Daniel Hart, (The Exorcist TV series) whose work echoes against itself as if the purpose of music could never be understood until you croaked. I highly recommend buying the soundtrack.However, like other new directors given a limited $100,000 budget, several issues still blare hot amidst the triumphs. Spoilers out of the way, the third act features time travel elements that receive too little time spent on sensical explanations. Its ""open to interpretation"" story gets too carried away with itself for public appeal. The ethnical casting decisions also causes distance between reality, as explorations of the limited cultural space are brilliant, yet Whitewashed: an Americanized Mexican family structure comes to mind, as well as a tribe of savage Native Americans. Likewise, two White drop-dead gorgeous celebrity A-listers play the lead roles, and barely any information is communicated about what these two lovers think of one another.Rather, the aftermath of the death triggers the most empathy. If you have ever been in love or felt in love, the silent loneliness each individual faces will deeply resonate. The eerie nature of a widow being watched by her dead husband skyrockets in sorrow; you too want their wants due to actions rather than words.The two leads, both together and apart, allow you to feel as hollow as the spirit on the poster. The husband, played by Casey Affleck (The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, Manchester by the Sea) wears the cotton sheet throughout 95% of the runtime, stunningly sad in posture just by staring with his misty nonexistent eyes. As for the wife, played by Rooney Mara, (Carol, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo) you feel her pain just by her eating a full pie until she pukes. When close up, she has no need to give a dramatic cry-face to express your tears as she listens to her former-husband's original music.Lowery understands his craft in blocking actors, with strict emphasis on posture, such as when the live husband cuddles his wife in bed or strokes her sobbing body with his cloaked, disembodied hand. He can generate the most out of each performance, even if one of them only exists to spill out philosophies around the theme.Lowery has demonstrated his ultimate strength as a director in constructing this effective, nonpreachy message. It helps you reconsider the importance of letting others know the impact of their legacy before breathing one last time, so they won't resort to imagining a miserable afterlife most everyone in the world fears.",A Ghost Story
128,Jack_C_,Interesting premise painfully executed,4,18 October 2017,"The first quarter of this film is excruciatingly slow and almost unwatchable. However, once Affleck dies and becomes a ghost, the audience is challenged to a powerful exercise in empathy. Putting oneself into the ghost's limited perspective and watching the world pass him by is the key to appreciating this film. the most powerful scene is when his GF came home after the funeral and ate an entire pie by herself for seven minutes.

It's not going to work for everyone even 20 minutes in I was thinking it wasn't for me. But it slowly settles into this rhythm of: 'What is all this for?' and 'Do we need something in our life to grab onto in order to want to keep going?'The performances from Rooney Mara and Casey Affleck are fine but I don't think the movie would be any less with other people in those roles.One thing I was struck with is that basically every shot in the movie is striking. I was worried that the 'full-screen' ratio of 1.33 to 1 was going to be a gimmick and annoying but if anything is allows the frame to be filled at all times. Beautiful landscape shots, contemplating ghosts and yes grief pie eating. None of it is showy but it was always gorgeous to look at.This movie is going to stay with me for a while and I'm glad I saw it in a theatre as I fear my TV at home won't visually give it justice.As a footnote I'll say that I've been reading some reviews comparing it to Terrence Malick and specifically Tree of Life.

The soundtrack by Daniel M. Wenda is sublime and tremendous- there is a track called Safe, Safe, Safe which contains the music near the end that really depicts the meaning of the movie. I was so impressed with the design and cinematography. That ghost costume was just brilliant and elegant. Acting with that restriction and still convey emotion through movement. Very clever.Truth be told, A Ghost Story is a film that has Casey Affleck as a Ghost wearing a white sheet with holes in it for eyes and features an actual FIVE MINUTE long scene of Rooney Mara sitting on the floor eating a pie. Funny as it sounds, it did make me sad and made me think about my existence and afterlife. The pie scene gets the attention- it was uncomfortable and time seems to slow down in the banality of it but if you've ever experienced crushing grief it's like that. To conclude, this is a very weird film that touches a nerve I didn't know was there.I kind of wish I saw this during it's screening at SGIFF two years ago (2017)- it's too gorgeous and poetic on a 4:3.

I think the writer and folks involved had some 'messages' to send the viewer but it's 'pretentious' , too vane of them to think i'd 'get' or 'understand' what they want to convey. A person could project psychology and philosophy to this film but a person would have just as much right to project psychology and philosophy to watching paint dry like another reviewer said. The picture was shot in that non full screen mode to make it more artsy and 'spooky' and draw my attention to that 'this is different'. It is different. It is slow, too slow, from beginning to end. And, probably, people who believe in 're-incarnation' or 'life after (and before) death' could have fun impuning things to this film. ONE BIG DISLIKE OF THE FILM IS THERE IS NO HUMOR WHEN THERE IS, OR SHOULD BE, HUMOR IN LIFE AND DEATH. The film doesn't have to be glum and sad and so contemplative to get across the mystery of what 'is'. A masterpiece of this kind of stuff is 'INTO GREAT SILENCE' which is around a 3 hour flick with no words, low budget, which says so much more than this film. At least, i think so. This is such a 'sad sack' film and didn't do much for me. I felt the show could have gone somewhere. But, it would have to be done entirely differently. Ha Ha. 'Baba Ho-Tep' is a FILM OF GREAT DEPTH with fantastic humor, acting and creativity which says tons more about life and death and 'what is' than this glum flick does. 'BABBA HO-TEP', i think , is the top of the line that other films ought to try to grade themselves by. The thing has so much humor yet so so much more to say.

However, I have gone through some gut wrenching depression in my life and therefore feel I can try my best to try, and give an open, honest, and neutral reviewI will admit that after hearing good things and reading some positive reviews that I was really looking forward to seeing this film.A ghost story has some deep, meaningful ideas about time and existence, and if you want to watch something both spiritual and emotional, however extremely slow paced then this just might be your cup of tea.I enjoyed this film to an extent personally, but felt it had many pros and cons depending what you are into. Whatever I say from this point is possibly a spoiler but again I'll try my best to be as vague as possible.Let's start with the positives. This film was pretty damn effective on an emotional level. It was haunting, and the soundtrack was absolutely chilling and truly remarkable. The song 'I Get Overwhelmed' stuck in my head long after the film was finished.The negatives are that this film is extremely slow. I mean I'm pretty sure you watch M eating a pie on the floor for about five agonising minutes, and while I can accept what the film is going for with her longing, fear, loneliness, loss, depression. There is still an element for having to entertain your audience. And I felt scenes like this so early in the piece dragged the film along at a real snail pace, and I desperately wanted the story itself to move forward.Maybe David Lowery was trying to hard. He ended up delivering his scenes in such a profoundly unique, and intensely boring way that's it gets to a point were you could make dinner, set the table, go to the bathroom, take a shower, and come back to the film an hour later, and honestly you would have missed absolutely nothing relevant to the actually story.For me this film was decent, it had the ideas to make it a truly remarkable film if more time, and focus was spent on the chemistry and love between C and M rather than the elements of watching time go by and opening your mind to different ideas of existence.There are obvious plot holes but then again when there is so much we don't understand about the concept then it's hard to really think of this as a major flaw in a film such as this.A ghost story was original and very different. I will recommend it on the understanding that this is a film that will affect people differently, therefore it could really touch you emotionally, and you will connect deeply with the story. Or you could feel frustrated with the films pacing, and find it extremely boring. As for me it was a bit of both and that's why I'm glad I have watched this film for the ideas it presents, but in no way is it one of my favourites.5/10",A Ghost Story

In the modern age of high action adrenaline most people don't have the patience anymore. If however you give it a chance it is actually a quite stunning piece of work. Many of the long silent scenes are 'haunting' and quite beautiful. This movie is the movie equivalent of not staring at your smart phone for 90 minutes.

143,aquascape,Provokes the mind but lacks energy,6,28 March 2018,"""A Ghost Story"" strikes one as an art-house drama, it has certain elements that can tie it to that: a low budget unconventional film with deep philosophical themes.It stars Casey Affleck and Rooney Mara as a young couple, marking the second collaboration between director David Lowery and the two actors. The premise of the film speaks about the death of Casey's character, whom we barely see on-screen, and his spirit as a white-sheet ghost in search for the truth of its existence.This movie definitely makes you think about what and if there is such a thing as the afterlife and the director has his own interesting idea on what that would be like.
However it's dragging pace made it a bit hard to watch without the tendency to do something else apart from paying attention. One thing that really caught my eyes and ears was the speech a random character gave about the universe and how we came to be. I thought that was one of the most interesting monologue I heard in a movie.""A Ghost Story"" is a challenging film, but it gets the message across in a sluggish way.",A Ghost Story

I fully expected this to be slow and it was so as it started off I wasn't angry but I was getting bored, anyone who has seen it can admit that the pie eating scene is a tad too long. However as the movie progresses it becomes better or even great in places, it is slow but it explores the passing of time and mortality in such a magnificent way that it makes the viewer think and reflect on their own life and what it means. As I said in the title this movie would go really well with Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon, especially the song Time. The story of the movie is very simple but effective and the length of it is perfect. The movie is an unexpected gem because even though people have recommended this I did not expect it to be one of the most resonant movies of 2017 for me and one that would make feel so sad and thoughtful.",A Ghost Story
145,Her-Excellency,Oh DEAR LORD. A Most Awful Ghost Bore,1,23 September 2017,"To begin, let me state that I actually LIKE ""pretentious"" movies and films that speak to you on a different level. THIS, however, was pure torture and while I feel that the creators truly wanted to say something, it was MORE THAN APPARENT that they didn't have ENOUGH to say and so they filled it with mindbogglingly SLOW and sluggish scenes. SPOILERS:I see that many have already covered the scene with the pie, but I feel that they didn't quite get the point across correctly or do the utter banality of it, justice. You have a FULL FIVE MINUTES (_time them_), although they truly feel like ten or more, of the main female lead doing nothing but EATING A PIE! And yes, she does so rather well, in that it is meant to make you uncomfortable, and it does, but not in the way I imagine it was intended to do so. Trust me when I say that NO film EVER, in the history of films, needs a scene where for five minutes someone does nothing but eat a pie. Beyond that, it is not counting the ten minutes it took her to walk into the house, put her mail down, walk around, stand at the sink, look out the window, turn around and FIND THE PIE ... ... .... OR for that matter, the forever minutes earlier in the film where she literally drags a chest or box of some kind to the curbside - and I must bring your attention to the use of the word DRAGS. The scene is shot in painstaking detail and unbelievable SLOWNESS as she does this, across her ridiculously lonnnnng front yard (really, can a front lawn be that large or was it CGI?), and then does not cut while she THEN walks back across her lawn into her house. Oh! AND HOW, just how, can we forget the never-ending completely passionless / emotionless scene at the beginning where the couple is in bed? In fact, the word which fits this movie to a ""T"" IS ""EMOTIONLESS"". Trust me when I tell you that I have literally seen two Kleenex tissues at the bottom of a trash receptacle which had more chemistry and emotion and a bond than these two people had. Honestly, it is just too much ... of nothing. This film should have been a short of some kind, or else it needed more work before it was released. I applaud the creators in wanting to bring this film to the screen, BUT if you KNOW a project is not ready or not worthy, WHY do it and insult your viewers with such trash?",A Ghost Story
146,scottingram,A Ghost Story Film Review,8,14 August 2017,"The new horror film A Ghost Story starring Casey Affleck and Rooney Mara.From acclaimed filmmaker David Lowery, A GHOST STORY follows a recently deceased young man C (American actor Casey Affleck - American Pie 2, Manchester By The Sea and is the younger brother of American actor Ben Affleck) who returns to his former home as a benevolent spectral presence repeatedly trying to connect with his beloved wife M (American actress Rooney Mara - The Social Network, Lion), and over time, others who pass through the house. As time unfolds, he arrives at an increasingly deep understanding of love, loss, his place in the world, and the world beyond. Lowery crafts a soulful and romantic portrait of life after death and a beautifully intimate meditation on some of lifeas most epic and profound questions.Overall A Ghost Story is a good horror film filled with drama, some mild scary moments, sadness, love, spooky moments, flashbacks, memories, dark scenes and other things throughout the film.So I will give A Ghost Story an overall rating of 3 out of 5 stars and A Ghost Story is worth seeing if you like horror films along the same lines as this.So if you get the chance to see A Ghost Story in the cinema then you should go and see it sooner than later.",A Ghost Story
147,CinePendejo,"One of the most unique, soulfull, and transcendent films of the year.",8,3 August 2017,"Trying to explain the silent brilliance of David Lowery's A GHOST STORY to a casual film goer seems impossible. How its a movie with almost zero dialogue and an abundance of unbroken shots sounds boring. How its centered around an Academy Award winning actor wearing a Charlie Brown costume and travels through time sounds stupid. How its also a meditation about time and space and how we perceive our own existence would sound utterly pretentious. At that point, that casual film goer would never be compelled to watch it.And yet A GHOST STORY manages to be incredible. No matter who this type of film appeals to, it speaks volumes with its simplistic style of filmmaking. In the ironic sense, the fact that it does little makes it probably the most far-reaching film of the year.The story is pretty much the loosest sense of the word, in that it doesn't have much going on. Casey Affleck and Rooney Mara both play a married couple moving into this house. After a freak accident, Affleck now roams the earth in a Charlie Brown ghost sheet while Mara mourns and laments from his sad passing.And its from there where the story doesn't really come into play. Instead, Affleck wanders around his old house as he loses all sense of time, spending what might be decades mourning about what he loved most and what he desperately needs.For such an absurd premise, the whole film admittedly grows within you the more you think about it. The 1:33:1 ratio of the film gives the sense of how trapped the main character is; much like the fantastic Xavier Dolan film MOMMY, it photographs the personal shell that Casey is stuck in. Though here it's unbroken, making him unable to move on from both what he possesses most and what he's subjected to do after death. The hard cuts, scene transitions, and long takes distorts our sense of time and space much like in the headspace of Casey. Sometimes moments fly by within years, sometimes it takes one long minute. The goofy-looking ghost sheet aspires to Lowery's usual childlike innocence from his other films to evoke a sort of ironic melancholy to the story. These small details add layers to Lowery's talent and offers a perspective we never thought we'd love to see.It's also near the end of the 2nd act that pretty much culminates all of this to something even more. After a whole hour of no dialogue, we're finally treated to a hefty monologue that drives the message home. Even if our moments, our memories, would ultimately come and go - even if some day we'll end up dead - there's always something very minuscule that would live on forever. And that is what Affleck does in this movie, passing countless time and countless moments in a place that symbolizes the one person and the few moments he loved in it the most.That's what the film is in general, simple moments that molds into something special. Many filmmakers fail so hard in capturing the heart of these type of movies (more specifically late period Terrence Malick) that its kind of inspiring that a filmmaker with only two major films before this pull this off more gracefully than any of them. For a guy that pretty much aspires to Malick's style of minimalism and ambiguous imagery in Ain't THEM BODIES SAINTS, PETE'S DRAGON, and a whole bunch of shorts, I found myself in glee that he manages to be better at being Terrence Malick than the actual Terrence Malick.A GHOST STORY sounds preposterous and needs plenty of time to think through, but I'm glad to say it's grown to be an instant classic. A great film that explores our needs to cling our precious moments among the fabrication of time and space, it still heartwarming, meditative, and almost funny. For a film that sounds like it was made in a weekend with a small crew, I was highly impressed. Give this a chance, no matter how odd the movie sounds.Ready my letterboxd account for more reviews: http://boxd.it/k9td",A Ghost Story
148,ladybug2535,"Intriguing take on ghosts, with a few flaws.",6,21 January 2018,"An intriguing and fairly new take on the ghost story--I adored the quirky winding sheet. The acting was great (dialog is minimal), and the cinematography well done. The director also did a good job of setting an appropriate melancholy atmosphere, with a few unexpected jolts tossed in for a change of pace. And a change of pace was sorely needed.For those who may be confused, this is NOT a horror story, and it's definitely not an action film. This is your basic haunting on simmer instead of the usual cinematic boil, in which ghosts stick around due to unfinished ""business"". 
Compounding their tragedy is the ghost's inability to speak or interact directly with the living--which it may be said, our ghost may have struggled with while still alive. Though married, he is presented as a self-absorbed musician who seems to take his loving wife for granted (avoiding the usual cliches) though it is apparent that they do love each other--and this is likely the key point clarifying just what the film is trying to say. We only glimpse a few scenes of their lives together--and even fewer scenes of him while alive, so I admit this may be a leap on my part, but it is one of the things that struck me during those scenes--and given the ending, well...... It's a story much more about human relationships and loneliness and connections than it is about anything inherently ""supernatural""- I would argue it's far more existential. In fact---If you view the film in that light it becomes a much more interesting film. Certainly there are enough hints throughout the movie to suggest that this is in fact the real premise. This story is not just exploring a standard ""haunting""; especially as it plays with linear time, and his ultimate motive for denying his wife's desire to move from that house: Her ""Why do you want to stay?"" Him ""History"". There is no attempt to provide all of the answers, and the one (unecessarily) lengthy exposition doesn't really help--though it may have been included to lead the audience to a more existential state of mind. In fact it may be that the inclusion of this erroneous speech may be there to emphasize what we don't know and ultimately can't answer. But hey, maybe I'm reading too much into this.A very low budget film (only $100,000!), it could have benefited from judicious editing. Given the complaints (and I agree) of too many scenes dragging on too long with no action, and with seemingly no point in doing so, the editor could easily have cut say 15 minutes off (or more) without the audience missing much of anything (even if my assertion in the previous paragraph is correct). The length of these slow scenes did not add to the emotional ambience or impact--or even in the telling of the story at all, and hurt the film a great deal. They were just irritating--and I genuinely liked the movie. In fact this is the only reason my score is as low as it is--and that's still a ""6""--maybe a ""7"". I'd compromise with a ""6.5"" if that was possible. To put it bluntly, these lengthy uncut--and in at least one scene, seemingly static scene turned off many viewers, and is the number one complaint. Even many of us who liked the film otherwise didn't care for their inclusion and knocked down our scores. I disagree that they added anything as far as allowing the viewer to empathize or ""feel"" the character's state of mind. That could have easily been done in a myriad of other less irritating ways. They ultimately felt like ill-considered filler, and affected how many people felt about the movie overall.It's a shame, as I felt there was more they could have done to tell the story better--given this is a story about the human connection I am puzzled as to why they didn't show more of those interactions--their impact on him, especially after he was a ghost. The transitions from seemingly incapable of doing more than just observe to....well, no spoilers here, but they were simply out of the blue. The few flashbacks didn't help enough, though I can certainly see what the director was going for. To be fair, it would be difficult for any actor to demonstrate much acting or emotion when completely hidden under a sheet-- successfully enabling this connection--this empathy between audience and ghost is a credit to everyone involved in this project. Again though, those too-lengthy ""breaks"" in the story hurt that connection. The pacing was a huge problem with both too much and too little to allow many in the audience to see and feel what the film-makers desired in what would have otherwise been a successfully engaging experience.To put it another way, in many ways this was an intriguing story but there were missed opportunities that would and could have expanded our emotional investment into the state of being of our titular ghost, and of how he felt as he haunted his house-which would have greatly improved the film and the audience's appreciation. Again, no spoilers, but the moments up to the final scene were another interesting angle that could possibly have been expanded. Recommended if you can welcome (endure?) a slow developing and thoughtful existential take on hauntings.",A Ghost Story
149,hi_im_manic,A Ghost Bore-y.,3,4 August 2017,"A man dies in a car accident and becomes a silent ghost draped in a white sheet who returns to his home. Dialogue is almost nil. Most scenes are painfully slow and dull. I loathe that I spent 10 minutes of my life watching Rooney Mara eat a pie ad- nauseum. I had a date and was sort of humiliated that I'd recommended this movie...it's terribly slow, uneventful, confusing and disinteresting. It was tedious viewing that frustrated both of us with its lack of continuity, long pauses and incoherent story. We probably would've enjoyed ""Wish Upon"" better although it has lower ratings. The positive: If you want to fall asleep Ghost Story is a wonderfully assistive device. It never perks up and it's as dead as the protagonist. This ghost is profoundly boring and pathetic, tragic melancholy is okay but this is unbearable. The ghost just stands around silent and shuffles around one location indefinitely. Casey Afflect had more intrigue in Manchester By The Sea and that film was nearly as tranquilizing as this snoozer is. The Positive: The acting and set... is pretty good, probably because it's so minimal, there's not much going on. It makes one think about the afterlife, and can generate conversation. Numerous other films can manage that task better. It's not worth the price of watching in a theater. Rent it instead of taking Nyquil some night. It will be in a box soon and forgotten more quickly than you can say ""I paid $1.50 to watch THIS crap!?!?"".",A Ghost Story

It seems to be about the history of time, our sense of belonging and that everything in this world is ethereal. There were some touching moments like the ghost trying to retrieve the note his living wife had left hidden in a doorway, two ghosts (or same ghost?) waving and acknowledging each other among everything else, but personally I felt it lacked something more substantial.

Telling the story of a recently deceased musician who returns to his suburban home to try to reconnect with his grieving wife, the film is not even remotely scary, but actually is a heartbreaking romance described by one critic as ""a singular exploration of legacy, love, loss and the enormity of existence."" Rooney Mara plays the young widow (with a penchant for eating an entire pie), and Casey Affleck, fresh from his Oscar winning role in last year's ""Manchester by the Sea"", plays the ghost, and this minimalist short feature, with little dialogue and even less physical action, manages to move viewers in ways that are totally unexpected. There are no elaborate effects for the ghost - in fact, he is portrayed merely as a sheet with holes for eyes - but the film has real emotional power through its subtlety and deep portrayal of loneliness.

This might have made an effective 20 minute short and I would have been satisfied, but this felt like some director's infantile self-indulgent and very expensive attempt to explain some weird dream he'd had after a hard night partying back in his college days, one he just ""knew"" people needed to experience too. Well, he was wrong. We didn't and we don't.
What strikes me most of all, however, is how utterly wasted the acting talent is in this movie! Did they really know This was what they were signing up for or were they strung along by this director's deluded self-indulgent message as well? I would have loved to hear the pitch on this script. And did they actually pay Casey Affleck the big bucks to stand motionless and silent under a sheet for the best part of the filming or was it a stand-in?
I couldn't help but be reminded of my youth (in the 60's) when children, unable to afford to purchase new, and without a mother who sewed, would throw an old sheet over their heads after cutting out eyeholes for a costume and run out the door yelling ""Trick or Treat!"" on Halloween!
This was bitterly disappointing and a complete waste of my time and I can forgive much if I feel there is an honest and earnest attempt being made. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, even if the alternative was to watch water boil.

160,ReelLifeReviews,A unique approach to love and loss,8,9 August 2017,"A Ghost Story - Minimalist storytelling with a haunting score. It's not a movie you and your buddies catch on a whim. This is one you prepare to see.The film is presented in an almost square 4:3 aspect ratio, making it feel like you're watching this couple's home movies, and experiencing their memories right alongside them. It was a little odd seeing it in the trailers, and I wondered if they would really do it for the feature itself, but I honestly couldn't picture seeing this any other way.We've had some excellent scores and soundtracks so far this year, as it seems I bring that topic up quite often. Up until now, however, I've only had one choice for best original song, that being 'For Evermore' from the live-action Beauty and the Beast. I'll have to do more research, but if it's eligible, 'I Get Overwhelmed' by Dark Rooms is now the one I'm rooting for. It's beautiful in its own right, but it's used just perfectly in helping to enhance the story. Please have a listen.This might have the fewest lines of any movie I've seen so far this year. In the heart of the film, however, there is a monologue given by a side character played by no one in particular. He touches on the importance, and the insignificance, of personal legacy. It's a dichotomy that is perfectly captured.In the first act of the film there are multiple lingering shots. It gets to the point where it's just awkward how the scene isn't progressing. The ultimate example is a scene of Rooney Mara eating a pie for over 5 minutes. Yes there's emotion there, but surely there's a more concise way to portray that. The runtime is already a slim 90 minutes, but it could have been trimmed down even more.A24, the young production company behind this film, has been absolutely killing it. In their 5 year tenure they've put out wholly unique stories the likes of Tusk, Ex Machina, Room, The Witch, The Lobster, Swiss Army Man, It Comes at Night, and 2016's Moonlight, which nabbed Best Picture. These run the gamut of genres, making them all the more impressive.

162,vesil_vesalier,"Between what is and what isn't, is there something more?",8,24 September 2020,"David Lowery writes and directs one of the most creative, interesting, surprising films I have ever seen. It involves a dead man, dressed in a sheet with cut-out eyes. Halloween costume-style.I admit, when I first saw the trailer years ago, I was surprised. It did capture my interest, however, so I made sure to put it on my list. Then it showed up on Netflix.It's surreal nature and truly stunning cinematography reminded me early on of Terrance Malick's work, although there actually IS a narrative here, instead of a set of majestic shots sewn together over a period of hours (no offense to you, Mr. Malick. You march to the beat of your own drum).And I'm not going to lie and say the film is perfect, because it is far from it.Casey Affleck continues to surprise me. He plays C here, the titular main character whose fate drives the majority of the plot. If that's him under the sheet the whole way, hats off to him for managing to portray a volume of emotions while wearing it (and also being able to pull it all off without losing the sheet. That must have been tough).Rooney Mara continues to do what she does best, deliver poignant, sometimes painful performances. The first film I noticed her in was THE DISCOVERY, in my opinion an underrated gem of a movie involving people and their reactions to death. The similar veins of dealing with such a subject are explored here, albeit in a completely different (and truly original) way.The biggest plus for me in this film was the careful shots of the ghost and its eyes. Somehow the slits seemed, at least to me, to change proportionally with the emotional state of the man behind the curtain, so to speak. It's possible it was just an accident, or that I'm looking too much into it, but I want to believe that something truly magical was happening here, where what should have been really freaking difficult if not impossible to pull off was being done right in front of my eyes. When he was angry, I could feel it. When he was sad, I noticed it. The eyes (or lack thereof) spoke volumes.The film is not without its problems. In an effort to deliver atmosphere, a few of the scenes run on too long for my taste. It threatens the continuity of the film, and worse, given the wrong atmosphere, it could shift into unwanted humor as a result. To have a dramatic piece involving a man watching the world unfold around him while he wears the kind of costume you'd see a parent with little to no money throw together at the last minute for a kid's Halloween costume, trying to keep the pace going while you spend more than ten minutes without shifting the camera risks you losing the atmosphere. In the defense of the director, I will say that never happened for me.But I can't lie and say I wasn't distracted occasionally by it. Looking around the room instead of watching what was on the screen, because what was on the screen wasn't changing enough to keep me interested.So I felt the pacing is what brought down the rating for this film for me. That was the big flaw in the narrative. For me a film is all about flow, and if you lose it, the magic can be lost.All in all this film is a study in the possibilities beyond life, the consciousness of existence, with some beautiful scenery thrown it to give the narrative atmosphere and sometimes even tension. A wonderful piece to behold, all in all.If you're looking for something truly original, I recommend giving it a try.",A Ghost Story

They stretch many scenes like a rubber band to the point they become a pain to watch.The basic premise is this - a husband dies and turns into a ghost. He sees his wife moving on and later loses everything he cared about. End of story.The ghost is unintentionally funny. Whoever thought to put a bedsheet over someone and call it a ghost is a fool. It's hard to take this ghost seriously.For them to increase the running time of this movie, they even showed a scene in which this wife is just eating food, alone. No conversation. No cuts.

How is that interesting to anyone?At one place, some random guy goes into a lengthy monologue about how nothing really matters and how every thing will eventually get destroyed. It was kind of interesting but it didn't need a 5 minute long monologue.Go watch this thing if you suffer from insomnia. This very well could've been a 20 minute long short film.",A Ghost Story

Don't.,1,23 September 2019,"I can only join the voices saying ""You have been warned"".Sometimes, an idea for a film might play out nicely in your own head, but when it comes to actually turn it into reality, it turns out that your head was the only place this idea ever worked at. This film is the epitomy of ""might work, but really doesn't"".In a bore-fest that in my film watching career has beaten every other bore-fest so far, a dude dies and continues to hang around as a ghost. And that's what he does for the whole film. Yup, it's a dude with a sheet over his head. A ghost, get it? And so he watches his grieving girlfriend he left behind doing trivial, boring things. Pointless scenes after pointless scenes that are not just too long, they are painfully long, making this film feel like a plotless, pretentious eternity.Seriously, no matter how little this film cost to make - who in the world thinks ""Oh, that's a great script!1!!"" and goes on to spend actual money on something like this?Some films are bad, so bad that you can still have a good laugh watching them.

There were definitely certain scenes that could have been cut shorter (I didn't need to see Rooney Mara's character eat an entire pie, or watch her and Casey Affleck mush their faces together for so long).

172,con_au,"In the end, I loved it",8,1 January 2018,"Director David Lowery has a habit of letting the camera's gaze dwell on scenes long after the actors have departed it, or its purpose has been realised. Like a ghost, like THIS ghost, we linger in spaces, waiting for something. That being said, while watching Rooney Mara eat a whole family-sized pie, my patience started to feel challenged.
Fortunately, Lowery and the very solid cast manage to keep a momentum going that atunes us to the tragic and seemingly eternal task of our ghost, the spectre of a young composer killed just as he and his partner approach a crossroad in their relationship.
The film certainly doesn't rely on dialogue to make its mark, although Will Oldham's party scene monologue gives him a huge chunk of screen time relative to the rest of the cast, and the task of mansplaining life, the universe, everything - including this film.
A Ghost Story is the ultimate POV shot, with our ghost forced to fix his big, round, black eyes on history, progress, tragedy, comedy, love, loss, domesticity and destruction as he acts as a silent, but not unexpressive, sentinel to his own little corner of the world.
Lowery has a deft hand and achieves an incredible result in telling a vast but very personal story almost exclusively in the language of cinematography and editing, rather than speech.
This was a slow burn, but was glad I didn't allow Rooney's grief-driven pie consumption to drive me out of it. I ended up loving A Ghost Story.",A Ghost Story
173,michaelrthomson,I was excited for this.... then I wasn't,6,21 September 2017,"I thought the idea of this was interesting, then I thought the previews/trailers looked interesting.... I wasn't so sure about the cast of actors (I don't get the Roony Mara thing at all?)..... but I waited with anticipation anyway because I thought this would be artistic but entertaining...If one is to be unkind, then yes, it's kinda dull and boring with little dialogue. If one is to be a little more generous, this lack of dialogue allows the viewer to form their own opinion on what is going on without the story being told to us, rather we can interpret it as we wish. I think more important than the main character were the occasional appearances of other 'friends' who upon realising or deciding their fate, disappeared.... and the whole circle of life (or death?) thing, well it's been done before, but this was a new spin on it for sure. As has been true all too often in 2017, I found myself losing interest within about 20 minutes, and roaming the App Store or looking at twitter held more interest on and off.... but it kept me interested enough not to turn it off completely I suppose.To me, it was telling a story of seemingly obsessive love, longing and in part loss, though the loss part seemed to be moved on from rather fast. It made me wonder if this happens, you know, are there really 'dead people everywhere', and if so, then it's sort of creepy don't you think to imagine they are there, hanging about in their sheets, watching, judging..... but I digress.Is it the best art house film I ever saw, certainly not.... is it the worst, no, it's not that either. :|",A Ghost Story

OK...the story is long and hardly any type of action, drama, or suspense. I don't even know if Casey is under that blanket or someone else. How do I rate performance of acting if they are under a white blanket with two holes as the eye socket, as a ghost?
There is very little dialogue ... mostly visual. It is also hard to add to the imagination of what is really going on...
I am watching it as I review this movie, and I am almost at the ending, so maybe there is something in the ending .. so far, I couldn't turn away, and I want to stop watching.

I think they made it too long which should've been maybe a 30 minute short or a series instead. But it was very slow, and if you like that kind, you might like this movie.

179,attennessee,i think i've explained myself,3,25 February 2020,"Wow so many of the reviews that give this movie a high rating are so full of crap reasons it's hilarious. it's like ""if we make it sound like you're just not hip/intelligent enough to get it you'll stop complaining about not getting it."" but your fluffy analysis, bloated self-importance and ""deeeep thoughts"" will not save this flat flick. and i will tell you why.first let me be clear --- i love moody movies that are thoughtful, metaphoric, slow paced, artistically filmed and do not rely on dialogue, noise or action to convey a perspective or carry a message. what those kinds of movies do rely on are gestures, music, expressions, emotions, setting and effective filming techniques.this movie offers none of these. there was not one moment where i experienced even the slightest revelation about life and death or where i identified with the loss or alienation. not one moment where i was drawn in by an expression, transformed by the suffering, or inclined to feel anything from an authentic gesture of pain, despondency or distress. nothing surprised me, nothing destroyed me.just cut-out figures with vacant movements imitating the most powerful of human events and emotions -- only to be standing so far from the nucleus of the experience as to render the impact mute and numb. it all seemed so irrelevant to me. just a complete lack of nuance --- around a very nuanced subject.and while the ghost himself is cold and alienated, the film itself doesn't have to be cold and alienating. but i guess in that sense one could say it's a performative success. still, it fails to include us. it never considered me; never reached out to me. it fails to engage, to inspire compassion or to enable us to relate to anyone else in this film. but what could be more relatable than the fears around death, loss, and permanent endings??in this way i found it NOT to be profound but to be profoundly self-absorbed; too head-up-its-a** to bother taking the time to bring us in to an experience, a feeling, a transformation. i literally couldn't have cared less about these people who seemed to be as clueless as we are about this whole affair. to me it felt like everyone phoned it in and walked off. turns out everyone is a ghost in this film; everyone is dead.** a lil sidebar convo -- not a minor muddle but ghosts aren't poltergeists (those disruptive entities responsible for shaking things up). poltergeists are dangerous; ghosts rarely are. ghosts cannot interact with our environment because they're in another dimension. poltergeists are energy entities created IN our dimension and as such are able to feed off and act out the energy/intentions of the living (and, say, throw dishes) in a way ghosts cannot. poltergeists are the result of redirected intense emotional feelings and turmoil expressed/suppressed by the living beings in the home, usually those that are coming of age/entering puberty. ain't them hormones saints. **but ohh those long shots, solemn stares and pompous reviews will save this hollow forgery of an ""art film"" that only inspires our ire because it offends our intelligence (and then implies we're stupid for being offended/duped --- ""you just didn't get it, silly!"") no, you just didn't deliver, silly!to be sure, this is a film about a fatality all right. its own. 3/10",A Ghost Story

I guess I kept waiting for more of the briefly given humanity between the two primary characters, a married couple who obviously deeply love one another but see life quite differently. After the fatal accident, the spectral movements of the ghost are nonlinear, which makes no sense since scents of the afterlife we have all enjoyed--whether we believe in life after death or not--tells a chronological tale of birth, awakening (hopefully), death of the body, and then eternal life. So, what do we have here? Concepts of ghosts and time travel and bereavement and drunk 30-somethings and even the history of a pioneer family (the littlest girl we assume being the female protag's great-great- grandmother).

185,R85ALIVE,Slowly but surely it captivates you.,9,14 July 2018,"It seems this has a very polarising effect upon the general audience. I'll admit it was a slow start to establish the tone and themes. Once the plot takes effect you start to really feel the effect of time upon the protagonist. This is such a subtle film in so many ways I'm not surprised it went over many peoples heads. Everything from the aspect ratio, the lingering shots, the chunks of visual storytelling peppered throughout the film, the musical score really drew me in and deeply touched me. This is very much a story about how time can effect our place in the world, and as cynical as it might sound, time passes and we are forgotten, but the film makes it sort of beautiful and touching. Even behind the white sheet Casey Affleck has a strong heartfelt presence.I wondered why Casey Afflecks character didn't follow his partner and decided to remain in the home throughout decades/100's of years. Once I understood that the history he has in the house keeps him there and how he was determined to linger in that spot till the cyclical nature of time in this world comes around again it was quite touching. Rooney Mara's character was somewhat different in that she does not see there being much history in their home, which i think alludes to their problematic relationship. So for me the film is about the impact we have in the surroundings we live in and how it can be remembered/forgotten/discarded and how we feel the need to never let go of that. It's a poignant visual representation of that theme and the camera lingers on many of these scenes just like we as humans desire to linger on the places and people we identify with, brilliant film",A Ghost Story
186,littlemankazoo,"A film with a whole lot to say, but an inability to say it",6,16 February 2018,"'A Ghost Story' is a film that, as its tagline says, is all about time.And 'Time' is what we certainly explore in the crisp 92 minute run-time of this film that meditates on what happens after we die, what our existence amounted to, and what memories have to do with time in its influence as it passes.Much as these are weighty concepts, and ones I think could make for a spectacular film if all bundled properly together into a cohesive piece, 'A Ghost Story' seems to fumble a bit with such grandiose concepts.Much as it sports this grand point, director/writer David Lowery struggles to get beyond this one particular point he wants to make. Like a showman, as any good director could feel they are, he displays his point he wants to make with flair and passion. You can feel his love for his message oozing from this film, and the care he feels for it as the film presents itself in a cozy and warm 4:3 presentation......But unfortunately, like any one-trick pony, it eventually gets old. The point of this film begins to hit home rather quickly, and it begins to feel one-note and almost tiresome at times. There's actually a certain point where a character even EXPLAINS the point of the film, in one form or another, and it almost borders on the line of pretentious.But, just because this point feels muted and one-note, does not mean this film lacks merit. Its presentation, as I said, is unique and feels remarkably cozy, almost like the blanket of a vivid family photograph or a memory from long ago. Along with that, the score is delightfully serene and almost 'cosmic' in nature, despite this film's remarkably small scale.Certain things will work for people in this film, certain things will not. A now-infamous scene in this film involving a pie still has me questioning whether I appreciated it for its gravity and weight to its story, or whether I disliked it for feeling self-indulgent and pretentious.In the end, however, this film is indeed like the memories it stands to comment on. Some memories are good for people. Others are bad. I know people who ADORE this film, and I know people who disliked it and felt it had little to say.In the end, it is mixed for me.

188,saccitygrl,Letting Go of the Immortal Beloved,8,9 October 2017,"I will not rehash the plot as others here have. Rather I will just share my thoughts on what I think the film is exploring, whether it did so well and what I think of the filmmaker's point of view. If not interested, skip this review.First, this is not a straightforward film. Its not something we are used to seeing in terms of what its title implies, its not something we are used to seeing in terms of grief nor is it something we have seen before in terms of love or love lost.What the film explores is attachment. In this case, attachment to one's (lost) love and perhaps a place. On the latter, I think that is incidental as I think the attachment to the place in this film is intertwined with the love the main character has for his wife.In the film, the main character eschews the hereafter to remain with his beloved. When she eventually moves on, the character remains, seemingly attached to the place he once lived. However, its fairly clear the attachment to the place is merely there because of his desire to know the last message his beloved left behind in their home together. Immediately upon having that question answered, the main character can let go.Its really an intriguing exploration of attachment and I truly enjoyed the superficial story presented. However, upon giving the film more thought, I find the film's themes unsettling.First unsettling aspect to the film: the ""speech"". It occurs about midway and I presume it is put there to clue the audience in on the filmmaker's thoughts embedded into the film. As I listened to this narcissistic speech, I found myself repeatedly asking ""yeah, so, your point?"" This man prattles on regarding the insignificance of all that we preoccupy ourselves with during this short carousel ride around the sun we call life. When contemplating the vastness of time and space and the smallness of a human life in that context, he is fixated on the notion of the desire of an individual to have a legacy. In particular, he seems to think this a big motive for great works of art. If not for the glory of god, then this character believes legacy is the point to art and presumably life. A big turn off to me--seems very narcissistic to spend your time slaving away working on and worrying about what will remain of oneself in the eons that are to come after your death. So this speech is the weakest part of the film and almost made me tune out and disregard the film as a whole.However, its when I began exploring this line of thought a bit more deeply, that a more awful aspect about the film was revealed. And that is the film's take on the other more commonly believed point to life--love.The film shows that holding on, even to the things/people we love, can cause one to be trapped or at least suffer greatly. It also shows, through the story of the neighbor ghost, that one can even hold on long after one has forgotten what or who one is holding on to. And perhaps the most bittersweet part of the film, is it shows that letting go is inevitable and how long that takes is up to us.Okay, that covers the overt thoughts that comprise the movie. You could leave it there. The letting go theme is heartwarming and seems enlightened I suppose. Entire religions are centered around this notion afterall.However, reflecting on this film further while writing this review I found another perhaps covert thought in this film that is much more unsettling than the overt messages. I say covert because I am not sure this aspect of the film is intentional. When the time loop overlaps we learn something else: that his beloved did not share in his deep attachment. With the second ghost appearing in the film when the time loop overlaps, I thought for a moment that his beloved had returned in death to join him. But this is not the case. Her absence from the story says something rather disheartening. Her absence means only one thing--she in death moved on leaving him behind. He was alone in his love and attachment. That is probably the saddest part of the story and makes the entire film a rather grim, nihilistic exercise.",A Ghost Story

Using the concept of ghosts as a comment on love, loss, and existence, as well as the brilliant choice of the crudest, most unrealistic, and simultaneously most iconic/symbolic form of the ghost in the sheet, creates a very promising basis.The first part of the film really worked for me: we see a masterful portrayal of grief from both sides of a couple separated by death, while witnessing the helplessness and loneliness that each of them experiences (with the difference that one of them can and will, eventually, move on). I would have loved it if the subject of the film had remained just that (maybe more appropriate for a short film format), also capitalising on the brief but clever and poetic encounter with the ghost next door.Since it's not a short film, however, we eventually get more things thrown at us: the rapid passage of time, the various tenants (including a rather forced philosophical monologue by some random guy), time travel to the distant future and back to the distant past. It's clearly trying to make a poignant statement about the meaning(lessness) of human existence, but it doesn't quite get there. I thought that the last part of the film (especially since Ghost 2.0) was the weakest: the time-loop idea could have had a point if it had helped us explore the couple's dynamics in more depth, but it didn't really have the time to do that and instead it gave us an intentionally unsatisfying ending (i.e. leaving us hanging as an artistic choice).In all, it's clearly a case of unfulfilled potential - or rather a case of unnecessarily making a great short film idea into a full-length feature.",A Ghost Story

196,susana-c-fernandes,A story about a ghost,7,22 July 2018,"Don't expect a typical horror movie, don't expect a ghost story, this is a story about a ghost. As we follow along the ghost of a man, the movie portraits the loneliness we associate to death, both on the living, who go on, and the dead. Grief is closely observed, almost voyeuristicly, and that is scary and disturbing as hell. Being left in this world ""alone"" by the one you love is definitely one of the most horrible things one can experience. And that's what horror is all about. On another hand, we see the utter loneliness of someone who dies. We will all have to cross that final door, completely alone. I mean, while we're greeted and cheered on upon entering this world, there's that dread, specially for the non-religious, that we'll be completely alone in the end. That is also what horror is all about. We have the opportunity to understand the logic of the ghost's voyage, from the director's perspective. What the ghost had to do to move on. What we will possibly have to do. And that's somewhat hopeful, the fact that the movie hints there's somewhere to move on to. But nothing too specific. And we can never be sure, right? You'd have to be pretty naive if you were expecting the ending to give you some straightforward answers. Life and death don't give you answers. All you can do is take it one day at a time and take long walks by the sea and spend time laughing and loving. Because life will always end up against a brick wall, no matter what. That's the only clear message the movie leaves us with, told us by that random guy at the party. Other than that we can only watch and let those feelings sink in and grow up a little. Learn something. And turn tomorrow into a good day.",A Ghost Story

I have never been that bored watching a movie but I guess that there is a first time for everything. 'A Ghost Story' is simply an empty movie full of blank scenes with no dialogue or action that makes you think that the filmmakers just forgot that the camera was rolling and just left. I just gave up on believing that something exciting was going to happen after a 10 minute scene of Rooney Mara eating a pie. Seriously that happened. To be honest after a certain point I was so bored that I just stopped paying that much attention. Many might say that it had meaning and it wanted to show the audience the life after death from a different prospective but let's be honest with ourselves: Even if that was true the movie is so unbelievably blank and boring that you are going to lose every interest you had to pay attention to its secret messages. I wouldn't watch it again not for 1 million dollars and I suggest you to stay away and whatever you do just don't watch it.

201,ryandannar,An odd but charming fable!,7,30 January 2020,"I'm not sure why it took me so long to get around to watching ""A Ghost Story,"" other than the fact that I missed it when it was at the theater, and it only came on Netflix recently. While I guess I expected a rather precious musing on grief and loss, what I found instead was a charming and odd fable of a film, a film rooted in the aforementioned themes but interested in much more. It could certainly be called precious, yes - and many will find it unforgivably slow - but it also has a big heart, some real ideas, and a beautiful visual sensibility.About the pacing of this film: ""A Ghost Story"" is almost as glacially slow as a Tarkovski film, but the style and pacing suit the subject-matter quite well. It is a contemplative film; the film is unrushed, lingering in the moments ""between"" anything happening, giving us ample time to soak-in the gorgeous visual compositions, to consider the nuances of the often wordless acting, and to really feel like we are living the scene right alongside the characters.There is a name for this approach to filmmaking. The celebrated American screenwriter/director Paul Schrader calls it Transcendental Style, and wrote a book about it. The idea is not to entertain, but to use film as a medium for imparting philisophical and/or spiritual ideas. One key component of transcendental style is - yes - boredom. Transcendental films often move at the speed of life - slowly - so as to force our expectations into a different place, and to draw us into a scene in a way we wouldn't ordinarily feel drawn.Obviously, this kind of thing doesn't work for every viewer. And honestly, even viewers who do appreciate this kind of experience don't want it with every film. But personally, when I am in the mood for it, as I apparently was tonight, I can deeply enjoy a film done in this style.Moving on: The film's ghost-in-a-sheet visual is goofy, yet the film renders it beautiful and haunting by - well, first of all, linking the sheet to the morgue, so that it's not just ""any"" sheet, but the sheet his body was covered in when his wife came to identify him. So in this way, the sheet becomes linked to her memories of him. And as he stands quite still in the house, the sheet draped over him, he resembles a piece of forgotten furniture - which again says much about her feelings, especially in her attempts to recover from grief and move on with her life.I was very surprised when the film moved beyond ""their"" story. I had thought the film would be a feature-length examination of their relationship and her recovery from grief. If I had known it was going to move beyond that, I probably would have watched it a lot sooner to be honest.However, it was also in these later sections where I started having some problems with the film. I thought it was really interesting how the movie stayed with the ghost for probably 100 years into the future as a bustling futuristic downtown sprung up from where his house used to be. I suppose I wish something more had been made of those scenes, or had kept pushing forward. I just wish the movie hadn't looped back on itself.I mean, I guess, okay, I can roll with the notion that he has become an entity unmoored in space and time, and moreover I can appreciate the notion that the filmmaker wanted to extend the theme of ""forgotten legacies"" to include that which came long before the couole's brief life together. But then I felt like this necessitated some pretty silly notions in the final moments - like, ""now there are two of the same ghost!"" It was like, everything else in the film seemed very rooted in real philosophical and emotional musings, and then suddenly there was this wonky at the end that didn't seem to say anything about anything real, but only seemed necessitated by the goofy time-loop which happed earlier. And it kind of had me giggling a little bit.But overall, I liked this film quite a bit!",A Ghost Story

I understand that scenes like the solid 5 minutes we watch M sitting on the floor eating pie (plus the minute before that while she's eating before she sits down) are supposed to evoke the feelings of emptiness that come between the periods of anguish we feel after experiencing a profound loss. Unfortunately those scenes are actually just plain boring. Had this film been about 30 to 45 minutes long, it would have been BRILLIANT.

205,Smallclone100,"A rumination on the enormity of life, love and time.",8,13 August 2017,"David Lowery's latest feels like a film that will be revered in 10 to 15 years time. I enjoyed 2013's 'Ain't them bodies Saints' - but this is a whole new ballgame. It's a complex, ambitious, minimalist almost 'art-house mystery drama' take on the human condition, existentialism and lets us realise that we are each a tiny pinprick of the bigger picture. It does deal in death and grief, as you might expect. But the overall message is more along the lines of a love story, but not in the traditional sense. The way Lowery expands on the relationship between man and his surroundings and man and woman is breathtaking and just left me totally overcome with emotion towards the end of the film.This movie will divide opinions. There will be those that think it's experimental, pretentious nonsense. But if you let it take you for a ride, and let it give you an 'experience' rather than a traditional narrative, then it won't disappoint. Overall I'd describe it as a ""rumination on the enormity of life, love and time"". It's an abstract viewpoint. A visual poem. Plus, some of the photography is mesmerising, and the score by Daniel Hart is absolutely perfect for setting the tone. It's also shot in a square aspect ratio that gives you the sense that we are watching a very personal interpretation.At the theatre I was in, 3 people walked out.

Why would you give a ghost visibility with a sheet when no one could see him.

Then I waited for her to finish that bloody damn pie, which seemed to magically replenish itself, minute after minute, culminating in a barf fest I could have done without.

How did this happen? And how did this actually manage to get such great reviews?! This is an empty and pretentious movie where nothing at all happens. There are 5-10 minute scenes of a ""character"" doing something totally pointless while a ghost stands in the background watching silently while not moving. Its almost comical. A good example of just such a scene is when Roony Mara tediously comes home and does some boring things such as sorting through mail and watering a plant and then proceeds to eat a pie for 7 minutes straight without anything else happening until she throws up. Sitting through that scene was just painful. The movie is also unintentionally funny. A good example of that is when Casey Affleck first becomes a ghost. Seeing him walk around with a big white blanket over him with two eye holes cut out looks silly. Its like what a 5 year old would wear for Halloween if he was going as a ghost. The whole movie has this deathly serious tone but every time you see this you just want to laugh. Another good example of unintentional hilarity is when two ghost are talking too each other with subtitles. Neither one is moving or speaking so how the hell can they understand one another? Through telepathy? I don't know but it looked hilarious. So in summary this movie was painfully boring with nothing of significance happening in its 90 min run time.

212,dpbertrand-126-427929,?????,3,22 April 2019,"I will start by saying I am at a bit of a loss. I finished the movie a few days ago, and it is still on my mind. Not because I loved it, as you can tell by my rating, however because I don't understand it.It's about a man who dies and instead of going to the afterlife he decides to stay with his wife, as a ghost, in their house. I don't think the writer/director had enough material to make a movie. The movie has a short runtime, however manages to feel long winded. For example, we spend close to 5 minutes watching the widow eat a pie before throwing up from eating too fast,I suppose it was her way of mourning. It's not that I didn't understand the scene its that there was no real weight to it. I didn't feel the personal attachment to this particular scene, I just wanted it to end. There are a number of scenes like this which make it very slow moving.The acting is fine, probably the best thing about the movie. Having a sheet on the main characters head for most of the movie makes it difficult to judge the acting on his part, however you do have a sense of what he is feeling during certain scenes. It's my reason for the three stars as anyone can imagine how difficult it would be to portray emotion through a sheet. Other than that I don't have much positive to say. It could have been done with more weight without being over emotional. I don't think that is what the writer was going for. They set out to make an arthouse movie that will make you think. I don't mind that style of movie as long as you don't make something that has a runtime of an hour and a half but feels three hours.Watch at your own risk!",A Ghost Story

The man wakes up covered by a sheet - a ghost, and proceeds to wander around the hospital, confused as to what had happened. A light shines at him - a simile for the light at the end of the tunnel, but he refuses to go as he cannot accept his destiny yet.The film is quite slow paced and therefore not all viewers will be engaged by it, however as the momentum speeds up and the events start going further in time, it becomes more and more interesting, unravelling the concepts of space and time like they have not been seen before - from the perspective of a usual spectator, almost like the audience was put inside the film, not able to do anything other than watch. The film is about devotion and and purposefulness; how hard sometimes it is to let go of the past and how a tiny detail can stop you from moving on.The ending of the film leaves many unanswered questions, which are left to the interpretation of the audience, thus making it one of the films which engage with the audience rather than present all of the information on a golden platter.",A Ghost Story

215,Alondro,A model for the Hollywood mentality...,3,29 November 2017,"And on that point, we delve into the self-congratulatory world of Hollywood elitism (which, after recent scandalous events, must by all thinking individuals be recognized as the utmost form of hypocrisy and self-contradiction).This very drab and ponderously slow-paced film offers us philosophy... at a pre-college level. The concepts that perhaps life has no meaning and everything we do fades to nothing is a notion anyone on the upper half of the IQ charts has already contemplated by middle school.But we must delve even beyond the veneer of the film's nihilistic notions of the universe, and when we do we find the events in the film contradict the philosophy entirely! The drugged-out drunk raver who blathers on about concepts clearly beyond his actual comprehension and educational level presents us with a presupposed conclusion that his speech, being the ONLY lengthy piece of vocal narrative in the entire film, is bestowing upon us some grand cosmic truth.And yet, ample evidence exists to declare this view FALSE within the film's own universe! I present the evidence thusly: 1: If we accept that the ghost lingers through a re-birth of the universe into a repeat universe, then already the druggie Plato's declaration that all trace of us vanishes before the universe ends is clearly wrong by the film's presented 'reality'.2. The speech supposes that each reborn universe is independent of the previous loop... proved wrong when the ghost interacts with an object in the room detected by the new copy of himself and his wife. This is true whether or not it was a new universe OR a time loop. The fact remains that the ghost directly influenced events in a time stream beyond his natural existence.3. The glowy doorway... we see this for a few moments. What was it? Well, we have no idea, but given that it is a DOORWAY, we can conclude that the offer to the ghost was there to STEP THROUGH IT!! And what would be on the 'other side'? Well, obviously something BEYOND DEATH! Otherwise, what would be the purpose of the doorway? All these suggestions are there that in the film's universe there are MULTIPLE ways even the most simple and uneventful life can influence the cosmos for eons, perhaps even into the next universe itself... and yet the movie seems to contradict itself again in a pure paradox when both ghosts we see abruptly disappear when they come to some conclusion.So, in all... is the movie saying anything? Or is it merely a loose amalgamation of random bits of philosophy assembled by a pseudo-intellectual who believes he's come to brilliant insights about life because a cabal of other similarly deficient simians have told him he's brilliant? The film throws out concepts, then gives evidence those are wrong, then contradicts that idea. In summation, it ends up being a shrug and ""I dunno!"" I could go into the love and relationship angles too, but those follow much the same patterns. Attachment is good, then bad, then good, then futile, then... I dunno! Is that all Lowery is really saying in this drawn out declaration of non-knowledge, that he has no idea what the reality is? Well, did it really require so much time to say so little? The only other possibility is that it's deliberate. That Lowery is giggling to himself right now that his stealthy middle finger to the art-house crowd has garnered the pretentious praise he expected from them for a film he made as pointlessly ponderous as possible, and only we who are able to separate ourselves from the fantasy world of the film and perform an analysis not merely of metaphysics but of motivation around the creation of the film itself are getting the joke.",A Ghost Story

He leaves his girlfriend behind, and this relationship is explored in depth throughout the movie.This film is a bit polarizing for me, because the themes that it explores are original and heartbreaking, but after the film was done I thought back on and realized it didn't quite add up. I will try to talk about this without spoiling it for those who have not seen it yet. The ghost, played by Casey Affleck, exists, like most ghosts do, because there is something keeping him in this life that he can't seem to figure out. By the end, we get two answers to this problem that don't seem to coincide with each other. The movie leads us to believe one thing near the end, but then changes its mind in the two minutes, which doesn't entirely work. However, the film still explores these themes in such a unique way that despite the mixed ending, it still gives you something to think about. It has a message that resonates, and, love it or hate it, you will remember it. My biggest complaint with this film is how slow it is. There is literally a scene where a character does nothing but eat an entire pie, and the scene lasts SEVEN WHOLE MINUTES. I had to make a serious effort to not get up, walk away, and do something else with my life. There are scenes that try so hard to be all indie and ""unique,"" but they end up coming off as bloated and pretentious. There is also a scene that basically tells you what the film is about when you don't need to be reminded. This scene is very out of place and doesn't really need to be there. Overall, this film is well-made and well-shot. It is shot in a different-looking frame with rounded edges which gives the whole movie a different look and feel.

In the end I saw the pie as some kind of weird metaphor.A bit later it felt like the film was building to a poignant close so I thought it must be a quite pretentious short. I imagined how mad all those NetFlix people would be about that. So I hit pause and saw that the slider was only half way through.

So I stuck with it, and I am very, very glad that I did.My advice to anyone considering watching A Ghost Story is this.
If you are good with sitting, staring and waiting, you're gonna like this. You will be rewarded with one of the best jump scares I've experienced in a long time. If you like the 'Jupiter and Beyond The Infinite' bit of '2001', this is gonna be your bag.
On the other hand, if you don't like to wait - or you don't like left field - give it a miss. Then you won't have to go to the trouble of writing one of these helpful ""*1/10"" reviews.
But I will say this: 'A Ghost Story' is full of surprises. It's a time travel film. You will get lost and then find your way again. You will probably say ""Aha!"" at some point. You'll realise, like the party people, that nothing matters, but that simultaneously everything matters.
It's certainly not everyone's cup of tea. But it does have something profound to say and in a way I haven't seen before. So settle down on the big fat couch, put your feet up and enjoy the opportunity to just sit and stare.",A Ghost Story

Although it has always seemed stupid to think about that, since death is an imminent logical end, this film poses how this scenario would be, the ghosts roam to eternity without any sense or reason, they even lose track of time, life after death would be that sad and empty, if life itself seems empty I can not imagine if we continue to live and feel after death, and that is something that this film captures very well and transmits it with so much emotion, nostalgia and depth that will have a sharp effect on you.This movie is also a technical and narrative achievement, films that try to tell history through cinematographic techniques without resorting to silly explanatory dialogues without underestimating their audience have always seemed superior to me with conventional narrative films. This film has such a shortage of dialogues but the faces of their actors are so expressive, and even Casey Affleck's face under a sheet, and the camera moves so well that the film only uses its shots to tell the story.",A Ghost Story

I'm not sure what this movie was setting out to do but entertain was surely not it. Here is an example of what to expect in this pretentious art piece. 10 minutes of dialogue free shots of a woman doing the dishes, some kitchen chores, eating a whole pie then going to bed. None of these things are done in a way that justifies them being on screen let alone being on screen for more than one minute.This film could have been compressed into a 10 or 15 minute short film and it would have maybe got a 7/10.

I can't. To say this movie was slow was an understatement. Early on you see a simple scene unfolding and you know it's a deep movie so you wait, and wait and wait (and wait) and nothing happens then the next scene is another simple scene unfolding. Wait wait wait nothing... Like literally nothing. About 1/2 way in I started fast-forwarding. 5 minutes of a woman eating a pie. 5 minutes is a long time to watch someone eat pie.

( And one thing I hate about ghost movies in particular is if the ghost can manipulate objects in the physical world very strongly. Sure there is a real incident of a ghost doing that if the ghost has really strong connection to the physical world and powerful will but even with that, the object manipulation is just weak. Like in the old Ghost movie with Demi Moore, IMO that's how a ghost should be portrayed. A ghost that can manipulate objects in the physical world like humans do can be a perfect serial killer. )",A Ghost Story

234,bseaman-20248,Avoid This Arty Pretense for a Movie,1,15 January 2018,"As a rule, I regard reviews on the Ebert review site as fairly reliable indications of the quality of a movie I am considering watching. However that is not the case here. A reviewer for the Ebert site gave ""A Ghost Story"" 4 stars and praised the film-maker's inventiveness.I can see this movie being instructive in a course for aspiring film-makers. There would be exam questions like: ""Discuss how the use of music combines with camera work to create mood."" Students would also I suppose be told to look for examples of the effective use of the camera pulling away or of close-ups. However, for the John and Jane Does of the world like me who watch movies to be entertained and/or challenged to look at things differently and/or escape to a different world for 100 minutes or so, this is a movie to avoid. The 90s comedy series Seinfeld had the tag line ""The Show About Nothing"". The irony is it was a show about something: finding comedy and making comedy about things that happen in the run of the day. ""A Ghost Story"" could have the tagline ""The Movie About Nothing"", because throughout much of the movie, nothing happens. If you find it fascinating to watch stills of somebody wearing a sheet with eye-holes cut out sitting or standing for minutes at a time, then this is the movie for you. I paused at the 45 minute mark to see how much was left. When I saw 50+ minutes of my life that I wouldn't get back, I hiit stop and decided this arty piece of dreck was done like dinner.",A Ghost Story
235,garyprosser1,Completely original but NOT for everyone.,9,25 July 2018,"Was delighted to find this on Netflix after not making it to the cinema to see it. Last night, I watched it and it was quite unlike any other film I've ever seen. It's not a horror, it's not a drama, a thriller or a comedy. It's a fantasy but it's also completely unlike any film I've ever watched. The premise is simple. Casey Affleck (C) and Rooney Mara (M) are a couple and the film starts with scenes of their domestic lives. C is then killed (not a spoiler) and M has to identify his body. So far, so familiar. What follows is film-making of a different kind. Yes, the idea of a dead person revisiting their loved one isn't new (Ghost, for example) and neither is the idea of a film from the point of view of a ghost (The Others) but the way it's done here is completely original and brilliantly effective. It's a brave move to design the ghost as a sheet with eye holes (much like a five year old would draw a ghost) and it shouldn't work but it does. At no point is it comical or absurd; once I'd got my head around it, I accepted it completely. C's ghost returns to the home and then plays silent, invisible witness to M's life as she grieves and moves forward. There is one remarkable scene (lasting a good few minutes) that shows only M eating a pie before being sick. C's ghost doesn't move throughout, watching and observing but unable to connect. It's a scene that drifts towards being too long before becoming more powerful. The rest of the film then plays with time, perspective and every other dimension going. The idea of existentialism rears its head constantly, particularly in one long speech (especially noteworthy in a film low on dialogue) by a house member who questions just how much we have to do in life (and how we nearly all fail) to ensure that we will be remembered by more than the next generation. All the while, C is there, watching and observing. He learns to affect the material items around him but ultimately, he is trapped. C is trapped in death and can't move on, M is trapped in grief but can move on. This dreamlike, hypnotic film will be a Marmite experience. For the many who will watch it and think ""what the hell was that dull, dreary nonsense all about?"", there will be someone who just falls in love with it. There's no storyline to unravel, no dialogue to quote and requote, no action, drama, car chases or raucous laughs, just a series of scenes and images that I couldn't get enough of. It's like watching a beautiful and completely original dream and it's a dream I'll watch again. 8.5/10",A Ghost Story

238,jaeelbooks,"Not Horror, Nor Is It Meant To Be",10,9 October 2020,"'A Ghost Story' is in all regards a poetic love story, filled with emotion and intrigue. It is not a horror story, which should be obvious to those who take the time to read the blurb. It is instead the story of a couple in love, one of which is taken from this life much too early - only to return as a ghost. The film takes some heat from reviewers for the usage of sheets for the ghosts. This is due to our culture and the way that we use sheets at Halloween time to costumes ourselves or our children into ghosts. It is a form we can relate to. There is a rather long pie-eating scene in the film, and it is an important scene as it shows the distress and heartache in the female lead over the death of her lover. There is also a rather long table conversation that, if you pay attention to it, is pertinent to the film. Look for a guest appearance from singer Kesha around that time. The cycling through time and space in 'A Ghost Story' is intriguing and heartbreaking all at once. It gives a deeper insight to what it must be like for a spirit, yearning to be with the one it loves, to be kept in a place and haunting it for endless days and nights. Tragic, passionate, well-written, and incredibly acted, 'A Ghost Story' is a winner on all accounts. I hope it is never remade. I hope there is never a sequel. It would be a shame to try to top this gem of a movie.",A Ghost Story

The people sitting next to me left the cinema about 20 minutes in because it is indeed a very slow moving film and I can understand why they left but that's the point of the film.

249,karlharvey1972,An existential journey to wake you from your unquestioning state of consciousness,10,9 January 2018,"By catching a sense of the indescribable quality of life, this movie achieves magic. How much you enjoy this as entertainment is down to whether you are tuned into this frequency of consciousness or not. How much does personality determine perception... determines what we have contemplated in the past, and whether it meets up with this movies vision and intention. Just like the story itself, would you upon dying turn to comfort those you left behind, regardless of how futile it would be. Would you love for someone hold you back from ascending to heaven?We see M alone after C has died, as much a ghostly figure as C. Eating a whole pie to herself quickly, until vomiting, just we ingest as much life as we can, only to die in the end. We throw it all back up. Should we gorge ourselves whilst we can because there is no other answer forthcoming, but the ingestion of all our senses, in an attempt to fill the anxiety of the existential question mark, why? Why do we die, how can it be taken away from us so suddenly?Humour usually misfires in serious scenarios, instead this film held the delicate balance like a rare flower that needs a precise about of sunlight to grow. What grows is unique among filmmaking, a deep introspective and existential journey. And, yes, I can keep using the word 'existential' because this film takes you from the comfort zone of love to grief, questions of your own mortality, along with encouraging you to ponder the multitude of possibilities that could happen to us beyond the grave. Do we want to go there, in this lifetime, and really think about it all? Those who never have and will never want to, may struggle to 'get' the meaning, they will miss the atmosphere and intention of the longer scenes.Being alone in a house can itself feel creepy, because there is always an energy present that hasn't made itself fully known to you. Yet, you sense it is there. The long scenes contain this, with lens, light, location and great direction of actors reactions to this environment and energy. For me, this took all the elements of fear, love, hope, loneliness and desperation, depression and wonder and brought you back around in a loop to the sense of questioning it all, all over again. The vibrations of love, anguish, dramas, hopes,.. linger in the wood work. What then when the house is brought down to its bare bones, scattered on the floor, like the atoms of the earth one day, blown across the universe, where then does out love go, our history, our individual life history, and love and experience. Our history as a species? What was it all for?The energy still lingers. But where? As one ghost remarks as the house they are standing in is also demolished ""I don't think they are coming."" then disappears under the sheet (like a sad children's magic trick), and with it the reason why she was standing there in the first place, this reason we seek within and across the universe. Yet, deep this level of deep reflection isn't exactly demanded of you if you want to just enjoy the movie as a visual commentary on wonder, and the absence of it itself. I loved the cycle; a ghost killing himself, dying - what is the afterlife of a ghost? lol, of course a funny scenario.. The irony of an immortal ghost being set to re-live what it had never seen before, yet come back to the same place for the eternal opportunity of closure.The speech by the man at the party is all you need to see how little most do wonder about it all. The point, the significance of being a species that has nothing but art, music and creativity to pass on to the next generation and the next planet we could move to,.. and in the end we lose that to the sun or universes impending demise. You've sort of heard it all before, from someone, you may have thought about it yourself at length, either way, the stunned silence is always the same. What is the purpose of it all? If all matter including the matter in our bodies are stuck in a Freudian death drive? All matter seeks to go back to its relatively inanimate state, back to its fundamental elements. We were never really human after all, we were just something the universe was doing, because it got bored. It kept its secrets in the end, just like the secret of what C wrote and put in the woodwork of the house remains a secret. We never know why. We just die, as M did, for a second time, upon reading it. Not to say that he died of shock, but that the reason, that was sustaining him in that dimension, was curiosity (which killed the cat), and it was satisfied. The search of sentiment until its twisted end, complete. The cycle, of reincarnation, ended. The Mayans believed there were 9 levels of the underworld one had to go through before being reincarnated. The movie mentions Beethovens 9th symphony (his last) as the song that may be heard through the rest of human existence when all material achievements were built and destroyed by nature, someone would still hum the melody and it would instil hope,.. for long while.. yet, in full knowledge of its futility, when the universe comes to expand beyond the hold of matter itself, and retract in a final calamity. It will be as thought nothing ever existed in this universe at all. What lasts is art, right? A song that will be sung forever, but by who, if the universe is so finite? The best we can hope for in immortality is to be stuck in a temporary yet continual loop of anxiety and loneliness, to walk the earth as a ghost, seeking closure to a life uncompleted, a meaning unrealized?Affleck who plays C, sees himself near the very beginning, with an acceptance of his fate, and possibly the fate of the universe. As though there is foresight already. He knows he is going to die. Even though there are matters pressing in areas of real world finances etc.. he makes music instead, tries to leave this last breath of his soul behind. M is moved, but then in bitter retraction in the moment at his level of apparent detachment from their predicament. Yet, the song does become her comfort when he is gone. The humour points to the absurdity of it all; we may as well laugh whilst trying to work out the dark mysteries of life, like the end, what happens to us in the end? 
If you can't laugh at it, maybe you have lost the plot by taking it all just a little to much to heart?All we have left, whilst alive, is the same piece of our soul that we can leave behind when we die, if we are lucky enough to have realized that. It's all temporary.",A Ghost Story

It gains a bit of momentum, and begins to involve you, at a visceral level, you empathize with the characters, but the takeaway is difficult to grasp. It is a reflection on life and death, both of which, in this view, are complicated, and somewhat sad. For some reason I can't really explain, I rather liked it.

253,GuilhermeTeixeiraSilva1002,It's all about time,9,26 July 2020,"It's a slow movie but it's a movie who got a place in my heart. The long shots give us the opportunity to visualize everything that surrounds the scene and gives the opportunity to actually have time to think about what happen. The 4:3 resolution at the beginning gives us the false impression that the movie is about the couple that it just present to us creating bounds with them and when a certain event occurs we have the false impression that the movie it might me close to the end but it's actually just starting. The first clue the movie give to us to make the audience realize that what we are seeing it's actually more then we think is presented with an amazing long take. One take that rimes with the poster.
The option that the director took to use an blanket with to holes on the eyes area to represent a ghost was indeed very clever and amazing. Clever because it's cheeper, and amazing because if they opted for the CGI it could look like someone was stalking the living characters Wich could lead the public to see the ghost not as a friendly and lost character but instead a dangerous one. The other reason is related to the proposal of the movie. The movie doesn't want to tell the story of one guy but the story of the life of humans. This movie provide us with some profund reflection about life and how short it is. (This reflection will be done with a tremendous monologue)

You may find you have to go back and watch the movie again. The music adds just the right mood as well, letting viewers know they things menacing are just under the surface, poised to manifest themselves at any moment.And most importantly, the story is a true ghost story.

260,largu,The 1000 year itch,8,5 October 2018,"After seeing ""A ghost story"" I thought that it was a rather good movie. Nothing fancy, not too long, a bit poetic, pretentious but not overly so, but also very empty. Quite nice and quiet nice. Still,it comes back to me. Looking back on 2018 I've seen a lot of movies which I hardly remember, and to be honest I do not remember ""A Ghost Story"" that well either but it will not leave me alone. The infamous pie scene that every hater here keeps whining about? Only a dim recollection and not a dealbreaker. There is a hypnotic quality to the movie that would have worked on me no matter what age I've seen it in. As a kid I would have been mesmerized as I was by classics as ""Great expectations"" and the black and white ""Hunchback of Notre-Dame"".I like the idea a lot. A ghost which is the archetypal ""white sheet"" ghost. Not scary but very sad. Also the tediousness and impotence of being stuck in a place without knowing really why yourself. As in life, so in death. Maybe I like the idea more than I like the movie, but it did touch something in my core which is more than any other movie have done in a long time. I'm terribly impatient but I still enjoyed it, so give it a go alright? It's definitely a hit-or-miss thing as these reviews can tell.",A Ghost Story

I had heard that there were a number of drawn out scenes, so I watched this for free on TV, and was sorting out stuff to give away to the 'op shop' (charity shop) at the same time. So was able to walk around and sort through things, send a couple of emails, make a cup of tea, have a glass of wine etc when a single scene started to last a long time. Given I had this 'respite' I did not find it as onerous as I probably would have, had I been in a cinema.
I agree with those who have said this would make a good Black Mirror episode or short film. I do think the content was s-t-r-e-t-c-h-e-d to last a feature film. However the film was not without its poignant moments. Great music too. There were some absorbing scenes and a sensitive message to the film, but i think the way the story was told - ie long drawn out scenes - would have exasperated many and mitigated the poignant message.

Not Horror or even Supernatural - this is an Arthouse meditation on the Meaning of Life/Death/Immortality. An experience. So not everyone's cup of tea. Even if you like said genre, you'll need to be in the right headspace. Give it 10-20 mins to try out. Relax and let yourself drift off into a bit of cinematic meditation. You won't miss anything.There's little action or dialogue. Each scene is exquisitely composed - often agonisingly slow and the soundtrack is sublime. There's a strong sense of everything happening (mostly nothing) in real time. Eons of real time. The comic-book cliche of a white-sheeted spectre is probably the only dark chuckle you'll get - the film is relentlessly sombre and not overly interested in warmth. Zero sentimentality.

This beautiful anti-thesis of modern filmmaking made it's rounds a few years ago, and was considered the indie-darling that people, including myself, just kinda passed on. It has stuck itself permanently into my brain, and will not leave. Every frame, every piece of dialogue, every movement - all contain such grandiose themes and elements, without having to be some meandering epic.

To me the movie is an observation on the transient, temporary nature of life, love and being. Along those lines it has a strong atheistic feel. I like movies that make me think and allow me to consider scenarios from the characters point of view. The monologue by Will Oldham in the party scene to me, is the directors attempt to put the viewer on the right path. It is not a summarization of the stories intent. Take from it what you will.

It seemed like there would be some sort of interaction or progress in coming to terms with the situation, but no, just years and years of loneliness while life goes on without you.Unfortunately, for me, the movie left me wanting to fast forward. It's filled with a lot of silence, staring and long drawn out scenes. The pie scene.....ugh.

281,super-joey,How sentimental are you?,10,1 February 2018,"I have a couple songs on my iTunes that I haven't played since 2009. Not because I don't like them, but because the last time I played them was the day my dog died, with whom I was very close. I know if I play those songs again, the date will update and whatever psychological ""connection"" I have with the day will be lost. Likewise, there was a house I lived in for 4 years with a person I loved dearly. To this day I dream about that house; Peering in through the windows and saddened that I don't see her and I in there together. In the dreams, it's usually empty or occupied by someone else. I often wonder, if I ever DID go back there, would it seem the same? Or different? Did we take the ""magic"" with us when we both moved on? One more story.... I have a friend who loved the movie ""Jaws"" so deeply that he went to Martha's Vineyard where it was filmed and buried something dear to him at one of the spots where the movie was made. It meant something to him, just to know a ""part of himself"" would always be there. That friend has since passed away. Anyway, if you identify with these sorts of stories, ""A Ghost Story"" might be a poignant experience for you. Especially if you have often asked the age-old question: Does it all have MEANING? Werner Herzog said the need to tell our story is what separates humans from cows in the field. But WHY do we feel this powerful need? Why do we have such deep connections with people, places and things? Why do we keep objects (tucked away in locked boxes) that we feel somehow ""define"" us? And, in the end, does any of it matter? This movie will touch some people deeply. Others, it won't. Neither are ""wrong."" It's just one of those movies that's not for everyone.Now, a word about the infamous pie eating scene...I like the scene because the character had just returned from a funeral and was fighting tears the entire time she gorged herself. I identified with her and thought of times when I had similar experiences. It was an almost meditational scene. I was absorbed by both the movie and my own memories....

It concerns a man who unexpectedly dies and has to haunt the same place because he cannot move on. The images are gorgeous and the score is perfect. It is best left to tell no more than that. I feel as if I might have said too much with the one sentence alone and betraying the filmmaker by doing so. If you have lost someone precious in your life, this will be especially affecting.

At first, time moves slowly for him, so excruciatingly slowly that it's hard to sit through. But he has to, so you have to. But just as it does for the living, time seems to speed up, but it doesn't do so in a releaving way. It just rather seems harder to hold on.Left with the nothingness are only the memories.A Ghost Story is probably one of the saddest movies I've ever seen on such a profound level.

A indie convoluted hipster attempt at ""art"". I wasn't expecting this film to grab my attention, but was intrigued by the idea of a guy walking around in a sheet and on that front this movie did not disappoint. About the first 30 min. I got the cliff notes with the fast forward button the movie is slow here and not worth watching beyond developing the cliff notes. The movie really begins after that where the filmography continues the same tempo but the plot speeds up (or starts)and the movie starts grabbing your attention. I'm taking off a star for the first 30 minutes tempo almost encouraging you to give up on it. This is not a movie to go in expecting something, question or think about so I can see where the poor reviews are coming from.For me it was an exercise in the state of now, had a story and got my attention, distracting me. I found it more entertaining then gone girl but in the same genre of movies you catch flipping through channels at a hotel relaxing before you go to sleep. May be a bit heavy for that if it actually grabs your attention. otherwise you'll be wanting your time back spending the 20 minutes afterwards poking holes in the plot.",A Ghost Story

This film somewhat reminded me of a movie by Chantal Akerman. If anyone went to see this film expecting a scare fest (like the Conjuring), i am sure you were disappointed. This film is a study of human nature, existentialism, not a cheap matinee, drive-in scare flick. For those who thought this movie was slow, try watching ''Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles""...
But i will wager that most ordinary minds will not likely ever learn how to appreciate movies like ''A Ghost Story''....

I had to fight through some of them... willing myself to go on. Usually I try to look for what the director was trying to say with each creative decision they make, but I couldn't really find a logical explanation for why someone would make a static scene of someone eating pie 4 MINUTES LONG!

308,tomfry-10237,"A thought provoking reflection on grief, regret, love and the many mysteries of life",9,25 August 2017,"David Lowery's 'A Ghost Story' is a masterfully crafted, heartbreaking and powerful reflection on life. It conveys to us pain, happiness, regret and so much more through mesmerising cinematography from Andrew Droz Palermo, as well as symbolic Mise en Scene in replacement for the traditional extensive pages of dialogue. It takes the staple rule of show and don't tell, and executes it impeccably.The film tells the story of a couple portrayed by Rooney Mara and Casey Affleck (referred to as M and C respectively, reinforcing how the film seems to be striving to convey a message about life and humanity over having a traditional narrative, as none of the characters have true names, only titles e.g. 'Man in wheelchair'). The pair live together and have a comfortable life together despite the occasional turbulence; however, tragedy strikes the couple when C passes away in a car crash, before returning as a Halloween- esque white sheet clad ghost, in order to try and reconnect with his grieving partner.The simplistic, almost cartoonish ghost portrayed by Academy Award winner Casey Affleck, despite acting as protagonist in nature, here simply acts as a vessel for the audience to witness grief, regret and pain accompanying death, with the narrative focusing more on exploring primal human emotion through the eyes of Affleck than delivering a traditional story. This is complemented by the framing of the film which has the audience view the film as if looking through a window almost, looking in on someone else's life, evoking sympathy as we can clearly witness the pain of the characters unfiltered.Personally I appreciated the bravery shown here in the filmmakers taking this opportunity to paint a portrait of human nature. However, this is likely to turn some people away as the film is an art house film in the most literal sense. It is a reflection, a message. It tells the audience to live life to the full, but it does so through great performances and masterful cinematic technique instead of expositional dialogue, taking its time to convey these messages, which could lead to some becoming bored. However, the true beauty and magic of this film is how masterfully it conveys emotion through cinematic language. For an example, there is a cross cut in the film which reverts back and forth to the original shot, and in which the same thing is happening in both shots, yet through the use of contrasting colour and cinematography two completely different emotions are evoked in the audience. It truly is mesmerising. In conclusion, I believe that this truly is an incredible piece of work. From the masterful utilisation of its score and cinematography to a quiet yet striking performance by Rooney Mara, David Lowery has crafted a reflection on the highs and lows of life that has you mesmerised for the entire run time, and doesn't leave your mind long after.",A Ghost Story
309,mark-2705,Uninspiring and annoyingly tedious.,2,15 June 2019,At least there's a nice pie eating scene in this movie. According to the info sheet it was a chocolate pie.

The rest is filled with visual drudgery of normal life passing by. Trying to extract any kind of visual poetry out of this flick is an exercise in futility.

Not even Casey Affleck knows because the piece of paper used for when he retrieves it was a completely different piece.Honestly, what's most compelling about A Ghost Story is everything surrounding this little MacGuffin.

314,cineconnoisseur,Thought-provoking and even explains a few things,7,6 December 2017,"I went into this movie with no expectations and left filling delighted, curious and enlightened. The movie moves at a weird pace, the beginning part to the death scene moving more rapidly and then the rest of the film kind of continuing on at a much slower pace. What made it unique and good is that it's told from the perspective of the ghost as usually when we think of loss, movies are told from the perspective of the surviving person. Loss being such a relatable topic, it was an opportunity to do something different and a well-executed one at that. To all the people whining about a pie scene, movies are a form of art. These are the same people that can go see a Marvell or DC movie and give it 10 stars, although a scene showing someone in agony over loss is 'too long' and thusly unrealistic. Beyond that, there's a beautiful marriage of emotion and music - whoever did the score and picked the music did a 9/10 job. The height of the movie for me was the scene when the ghost absolutely loses it and starts wrecking the house with the family in it. There are so many paranormal TV shows and movies out there and most of the time they make ghosts look like these malicious beings that just wreck havoc and yell ""get out"" but the thing we've never gotten is a ""WHY"" - Why are ghosts like this? This movie explains that to you in a thought- provoking and believable way. The only parts of the movie that were a little weird, fuzzy or that I would've done differently are. (1) It would've been more believable that the tiny house in the middle of nowhere became an apartment complex instead of some big financial firm surrounded by a city; (2) the time jump backwards was a little weird as well and then towards the end there's two ghosts and the ending was a little weird and confusing",A Ghost Story

To hurry through them, or to expect them all to be equally deployed, is to miss the sum of them and to, instead, merely tally and rearrange the parts.Like a symbolist poem, the film expects the viewer to work a little---to bring appreciation, experience, and receptivity to the viewing.

334,estaugas,A Ghost Story,9,10 March 2020,"The film is a ghost story, in the sense that there's a ghost in it, but it's also much more: a love story, a science fiction-inflected story about time travel and or time loops, an exploration of grief, loneliness and denial, the ephemeral nature of the flesh, and the anxiousness that comes from contemplating the end of consciousnes.The film's presents ghosthood as a purgatorial in-between state, inhabited by individuals who refuse to let go of the life they can no longer have. This concept is conveyed through very little dialogue and minimalistic settings, evoking a very somber and encapsulating experience which is emphasised by the boxy ratio and bleak lighting.Due to the heavy reliance on visual story-telling, cinematography plays an important part of the film and thankfully is was executed beautifully. The film is packed with many long takes and still cameras, giving way to a very slow paced film and leaning towards the interpective feel of the movie, allowing time to truly think over what's on screen and immersing the audience into its many themes. More immersion is added by the square-ish ratio and rounded edges, constricting us to the story and giving the vibe that we're looking into a key-hole at another's journey which in turns makes us think of our own journey through life.The tracks are beautifully composted evoking a lot emotion and serving as a perfect companion to the thought provoking themes adding much more depth to the whole experience.Overall you will either love a Ghost Story or outright hate it. Questions and ideas are constantly thrown at the audience with little answers, which many will see as 'fake deep', but I loved it, this film really worked for me. The movie feels very personal due to the constant comparison of one's life and the ghost's inducing so much thought and feelings as one tried to comprehend what the movies trying to say.(Spoilers)
I also want to comment on the party scene where Will Oldham has a nihilistic, pretentious monologue about meaning and the universe. Many people bash on this scene for its exposition nature and fake depth, but I think the writer's intentionally did this purposely so that they could refute it using the ghosts story. The cynical and lasting power of human attachment shown by the ghost is supposed to serve as a counter-example to the nihilism that manifests when one considers the idea of a universe build-to-end and be forgotten, demonstrating the useless of going out of your way for meaning. Meaning is achieved through experience. And this is why despite the progression of time that sweeps up the ghost towards the future and past, the ghost ends up at the same point of attachment.",A Ghost Story
335,kindred122,For Those Comfortable with Silence,8,11 January 2020,"I truly enjoyed this movie. Actually, I enjoyed all of it with the exception of the scene where there's actually a lot of talking. One guy at a party going on and on about the futility of life and how we're all basically just dust in the wind, as if it was some unique revelation that only he had discovered and it was his duty to impart his wisdom to the masses. I hated that guy and I hated his pretentious speech. But I loved the rest of the movie. Most of the movie is very quiet and very still. l personally loved that. The parts that I loved seem to be the parts that most posters on here hate. But that's no surprise to me because most human beings can't stand silence. They can't stand being still for any longer than absolutely necessary. Just look at how many people are complaining about the pie scene! I personally felt that scene was very realistic of how some people deal with death and grief. I remember when my dad died, the house seemed so quiet even though he wasn't even a talkative man. But the lack of his presence made it quiet. After getting home from the funeral, my mother stood at the kitchen sink washing dishes that didn't need to be washed. I ate anything I could get my hands on. We did this in total silence. I now intentionally spend a couple hours a day in complete silence by myself. It is healing. But some people can't handle that in real life, let alone in a movie. If you're someone who needs excitement, excitement, excitement all the time then this movie is definitely not for you. However, if you're someone who understands the importance of introspection and that there is peace in being still, then I would highly suggest this movie despite the eye roll inducing speech by the obnoxious idiot at the party.",A Ghost Story

Most likely a ""ghost"" is seen not by the usual aspect of the eye seeing something and projecting the image to the brain but rather by an image being created by the brain; irrespective of something actually being there. Certainly if ghosts existed they would have been detected by now with the precision scientific instruments now used by researchers. Having said all that I must say that IF ghosts exist then their existence would be like what is shown in this movie. It shows how a ghost could be so determined that it stays around and instead of going to that ""somewhere else"" that all of us are destined to go to.

I believe any human who's ever wondered about life's purpose or the afterdeath felt swept off his feet by this piece. It spoke to me in particular, for it brings back the feeling and my deep beliefs after my grandmother's death in 2017 and then my father's death in 2018. I couldn't help but feel - actually, but be sure - that they were very close by. Of course there'll never (who knows?) be proof of that, but truth is I woke up to my grandmother's voice calling my name out loud. I knew where she needed me to be, and I went straight to grandpa's to keep him company, for he was crushed after her death. I felt she was around making sure we were all ok, much as she had done during chemo. I had to tell her to let go, and that's when she abandoned the threatments, for they were making her worse and she had little energy (or life) to spare at that point. As per her afterdeath, I knew there were a few words she needed to hear from me, and I waited for her tomb to be finished to tell her what I needed her to know, and what she needed to hear before leaving. I wanted her to see her final resting place and then set her free.This movie made me realize that either our ghosts are right there, or we project them, the whole of us isn't really gone after our body collapses. I also happen to love both Mara & Casey Affleck, to see them together in such a sensitive piece of art moved me all the more. I knew exactly what he needed to be free, to be gone. I didn't find the ghost funny or ridiculous - I think that's how you'd see it if you don't care to see beneath the surface. I loved the reflections the movied took me through, I suffered from them, as any other human with the sense of how unstable everything really is, how everything might be finished in a blink, or how a comet may pass by and all our daily issues fade into cosmic dust. It trully broke me, it put me into tears. I had to smoke two cigarrettes in a row and sit outside, staring at the night skies, and ask myself how much more we have to endure before finally being released into space. I love, and therefore I am not free. Much like our C. in the movie.Thanks so much, it really did add something to my life.

Have a narrator, some interviews, some re-enactments of ghosts or something similar - teach us something about your beliefs in the afterlife, etc. - but don't believe for one minute that what you did was even remotely intriguing - I don't care what YOU as a filmmaker think about ghosts, mourning, grief, etc. - you chose the wrong medium to express it.

349,AgentMosco,Official 'Mosco Mgazine' Review,8,19 December 2019,"I'll start off by admitting that I put this film on whilst in bed fully expecting to fall asleep. It starts off with minimal dialogue and a nice sombre feeling so I thought sleep was beckoning but as it turned out, it was really captivating, and I ended up watching it twice in a row.
The film takes on the lesser tackled subject of the unfathomable grief and loneliness of a ghost. It really does, and it does it well.
You'll surely know the basic synopsis so I won't waste time with that and just tell you that you really feel for this ghost. The motion and actions of the ghost are so well done that you almost see facial expressions and emotion on a white bed sheet with holes in it.
The mundanity of being a ghost too, it's something I hadn't before considered. Cutting about your own house, grieving for the life you've lost with absolutely nothing you can do about it. The sparse dialogue really gives you time to think about the emotions of the characters too which I thought was really cool.
I've saw loads of brutal reviews of this, and I can kind of get why some would say it's boring but this is superior, intellectual film making and I'd recommend this a lot.",A Ghost Story

354,keegansantiago,A Beautiful Film on the subject Life/Death,10,25 July 2017,"A Ghost Story is a beautiful and moving art film about the feeling of loss and the theme of dying. The film expresses this amazing theme, by expressing what people go through when they loose somebody and about how dying is a sad, yet a natural part of life. The film also includes amazing factors such as great directing skills, a talented cast, and beautiful shots. The thing about these factors is that the film uses them to give the message about loss/dying to the audience, but the fascinating thing about these factors is that the film doesn't heavily rely on one specific factor to fully deliver the message to the audience, because the film fully delivers the message on its own using all of these factors without relying on just one specific factor. The film was an overall great creation and I recommend everyone to see it due to its subject matter of life/death. I am also warning that the film does require some patience to watch it as shots could be long and slow, but don't let impatience ruin your time, as the film's message is just beautiful, and due to the fact that it is extremely well executed.",A Ghost Story

No special effects. I hope Casey Affleck wasn't paid much, since he's visible for about 10 minutes. The rest is somebody (Affleck?) standing almost motionless with a sheet over his head.

The only philosophical question posed in the movie was not countered with other opinions. A question or two were asked, but it didn't seize the opportunity to use the moment to really question life. It gave a single version, while perhaps not mainstream, it was also not a mind-blowing revelation. The next conundrum Is how the past and future overlap. Or did it? Did history, literally, repeat itself? Is this meant to support the theory addressed in one of the few scenes to include dialog. Does this mean all other theories are debunked? We are not given even that much from the movie. Finally, the one action that actually had some merit, the note, we are not given any answers. I waited, only to find out about the note. I realize that doesn't matter what it said, per se, just that it was written and left. However, it still became the catalyst for him leaving.

Once I had settled into the rhythm of the film, I became more and more drawn in to the concept - what if we are destined to be trapped in one place when we die?

371,smeghead-204-486695,Being a Bitter Ghost is Sad and Boring,5,10 December 2017,"This movie had so much potential in exploring a topic I have pondered over countless times: what would it be like if all you could do was observe one limited place in the world, without being able to affect anything that's happening. I have been wondering if it was possible to find meaning in living through other people's experiences, in forgetting yourself and becoming one with the inhabitants of a house/room. Could that be a means of not going insane or becoming utterly miserable? And if it could, what would happen when the inhabitants change, or the place is destroyed and replaced? How would that affect you if you had completely immersed yourself in the previous people's lives. Would you be able to recover and adjust becoming one with the new inhabitants or would that be the end and you would break, turning miserable forever or going crazy?Well, as I've learned from this movie – if you are a boring bitter ghost who does nothing but get uncontrollably angry at everything that is natural and unavoidable (e.g. somebody with kids moving into the house, your wife kissing a man and instantly regretting it), then your life will be a big mess of heart-wrenching mundanity. To be honest, I figured as much, but it's nice to see someone shares my opinion. And I understand that seeing your wife kiss a man and not being able to do anything is horrible, that he probably wanted kids and seeing them in his house was very hard, so he snapped. However, there is not even a slight hint at ambiguity, at the ghost feeling any empathy for anyone, at the ghost attempting or at least wanting to help a single person (e.g. the other ghost that is in his exact same). The ghost is just a miserable dude who's entirely fixated on his past. If he feels nothing for any of the inhabitants, for the ghost that's suffering exactly like him, for the people being murdered – should we really feel sorry for him? As funny as it sounds, we see him doing nothing but bad things after his death what an unpleasant ghost! All in all, the movie felt like a meditation on generic behavior: you had a ghost doing ghost things (hiding in the wardrobe and throwing plates), a bereaved wife doing bereaved wife things (kissing the man who consoles her, then instantly regretting it), hipsters delivering hipster speeches, and, finally, the ending was as obvious as it could be. Maybe it was all intentional, but I felt like halfway through every scene you could just write ""Simply imagine the most obvious ending to this scene and fast-forward 5 minutes or go grab a snack and leave the movie running"".",A Ghost Story

I don't know what those reviewers were on when they saw this film, but it must have been profoundly righteous. Hands down one of the worst films I've seen this year, and we've seen some pretty bad ones recently.For all of its other obvious flaws this movie commits the cardinal sin of any non-action flick: it gives you no reason to care about the characters. They are a generic young married couple about whom we know nothing and who show no glimpse of their personalities. Why were they so in love with each other? What was so special about their relationship that his ghost is compelled to haunt the house? It makes me wonder if the original screenplay was as bereft of character development as the final film, or if the producer and/or director replaced the characters with archetypes in an attempt to make this a ""meditation"" instead of a movie.

However, it seems with A Ghost Story, they went to far into art house without offering a substantial or interesting point of view on its' themes. I didn't expect to find an answer to the meaning of life but nothing the movie provided made me believe that they had a reason for telling this story. That being said, there were some great moments, specifically the ending and a scene involving listening to a song. There were some gorgeous shots during the movie but many shots held on for much too long, such as when Rooney Mara eats pie. It made me question whether or not they had to pad the running time to hit feature length. Overall, the beginning did not make me intrigued in the relationship and apparently neither was the film as Rooney Mara leaves halfway through in order to show completely uninteresting characters and a scene where the director insults the audience's intelligence and explains any themes they were trying to go for. The acting was passable, no real stand outs. A Ghost Story offers some beautiful visuals in between long uninteresting scenes for a pretentious theme that gives no unique substance.",A Ghost Story

378,samueljglyn,"Creative, powerful and unique. But it's perfectly understandable if you dislike it.",8,23 August 2018,"2017's A Ghost Story is a relatively short film at 90 minutes, but the pacing is slow - sometimes excruciatingly so. Despite this, I believe there is a tremendous amount of substance to it, and hidden beneath its solemnity and silence is a quiet beauty unlike any film I've seen before.Casey Affleck plays an unnamed musician, relatively devoid of personality, who becomes a ghost after his death in a sudden car accident. Forced to stay on this earth, he passes his time by observing his grieving wife - played by Rooney Mara - silently conversing with another ghost next door through a window and, when his wife leaves the house, continuing to quietly watch the next occupants of the house. And the next. And the next, all whilst trying to finally seek closure.Now, there are two important things to understand about the genre of this film before we delve a bit further. One, it's not a horror film, despite the poster. Two, it's not a romance, despite what several critics insist on saying, for some reason. Onto the crux of the matter. The film is not casual or easy viewing. Like I said, it's extremely slow, and doesn't have much of a plot or characters. Furthermore,certain scenes drag out for an incredibly long time. Two sequences come to mind with this comment - a scene where the couple are kissing in bed, and a scene where the ghost watches his wife literally eat an entire pie in one, static, unbroken shot. I'm not kidding. I would be lying if I said these didn't bother me at all, because they certainly do. They do get boring, and they do overstay their welcome. But with the latter of these - the pie scene - there is a real artistic poignancy in how uncomfortable the viewer becomes. We are placed in the shoes of the ghost, unable to do anything but stand and observe, totally helpless. It is also unflinching in its portrayal of a grieving partner, and produces heart-wrenching emotion without any over-the-top wailing or gnashing of teeth, like you see in so many films. Nevertheless, the film is clearly flawed. I do not deny that, I only defend what I see as a deliberate choice from the filmmaker.Other than a handful of overlong scenes, I think the quiet style of the film is pulled off incredibly well. It's not easy to make a film with little dialogue, plot or character, and make it remotely meaningful at all. The music is sombre and gorgeous, the shots are simply exquisite - I particularly love the wide crane shots as the ghost wanders, small and alone, through the wilderness, and even though Casey Affleck isn't left with much to do when his whole body is covered for most of the film, his subtle head movements add a lot to the emotions that must be experienced by the observant ghost. One must also remark on the costume, which is comically simple in design and yet adds some real mournful gravitas to any shots featuring it. But it's one thing to say it has meaning, another entirely to understand what that meaning is.Truth is, I don't exactly know. There's this idea of what allows us to keep going in the universe that the story seems to pivot around. For the ghost, observing people and their actions seems to divert him and give him some sort of meditative purpose, only for him to lose that purpose when he comes full circle and start observing himself. Another potential interpretation is the fleeting nature of existence and what we leave behind. The ghost is tethered to the world by the final remnant of his time spent on it - the house he lived in - and when it's destroyed, he wanders aimlessly and joylessly, eventually attempting to commit suicide off a roof, showing how he feels the world left him behind when his wife left the building. If I were to give a real analysis, I would say the film juggles many different themes without trying to fully analyse any one of them - grief, love, death, memory. One one hand, I'd prefer it if it was more focused on succinctly talking about one. One the other, at the very least it gets the viewer to think about these topics themselves, for which it should be commended.A Ghost Story is less a film, more a meditation. It is slow, boring, artsy and at times pretentious. This is a perfectly valid opinion to have. But allow me to provide another.A Ghost Story is pure, atmospheric emotion condensed into one film. It doesn't explain a lot, it doesn't do everything perfectly. But the film glows with a quiet and powerful belief in what it says. It's like a symphony, composed by an inexperienced but talented musician, who maybe misses the odd note, maybe holds some notes longer than they ought to be held, but can ultimately be viewed, be heard, be experienced as something beautiful",A Ghost Story

I kept thinking it would stop and it wouldn't. Kind of how I felt about the film as a whole, it felt like a two and a half hour movie.

I Thankyou.",1,7 February 2018,"David Lowery is well and truly on my Shyamalan list of Directors to avoid at all costs.I now have a fear of Pie and I can't trust the majority of 'Critics/reviewers' ever again. I certainly won't be letting the Wife pick a film for a while (please note - she wanted us to turn it off before I did, some 31 minutes in.)Many of the folks giving it 10's (or even 3's) are assuming you have to be of a certain intellect to understand and enjoy this utter garbage. I don't trust anyone of you reviewers who gave it anything higher than a 2 - and I don't trust the 2'ers very much either. I would not go to the pub with you, I would not text you, I would not go to the sandwich shop round the corner with you and I wouldn't invite you to my party. Harsh I know, but true.Some points I need to mention. The 'Masterpiece' reviewers, who assume we who loathe this twaddle are not in touch with the spiritual world or don't like Arty films, etc, have some common themes in their reasoning as to why they loved it:'The power of their love/ Love is timeless' - As we saw the unhappy couple for all of ten minutes (probably in 2 x scenes) I got no great feeling of a deeply moving love story - AT ALL. In fact, Ghostyboy just stands there throughout, how can you tell he's hurting. Looks bored and useless to me in his big old sheet, barely portrays any pain or longing.'Pie Scene' - I promise you..I absolutely promise you that I'm not kidding when I say it made me feel sick. The noise, the ridiculous amount of time it took, the pointlessness of it. the pretentiousness of it, the realization that the previous drawn out scenes were not yet done - the worst scene in movie history. 'Great performances' - Affleck is in a sheet FFS.'Looks so deeply and cleverly at life and death, our time on this earth' - No it doesn't. It's just a boring story of a ghost trapped in a house trying to get to a piece of paper his pie scoffing wife left there one time. If this film made you contemplate anything on life, love and death on a major level then I suspect you overly think things and should probably stop trying so hard.

If all you're seeing is someone eating a pie for 5 minutes and a dude with a blanket on his head, then turn it off immediately, for this is not the movie for you. However if your find yourself thinking deeply then you're going to enjoy it.

Big oval eye holes and and all the ghost is the silliest thing you've ever seen, but as he watches his girlfriend struggle with her grief and as time passes - and as he figures out he has some ability to move in time himself - you're touched.

399,lukefine2799,A Ghost Story,10,4 November 2017,"I had seen the trailer for this film on youtube some time before it was released. As someone who has an interest in artistic films, this deeply intrigued me. Before anyone reads any further, this movie is not for everyone. I wouldn't even call this a film. This movie is not a traditional film. This is an experience. I would argue that there isn't a first second or third act. It is a meditative film about life, death, time, and the soul. So with that being said, this review is my personal opinion, and how I rate this movie is based off of my personal experience. Everyone else's may vary, and I suggest that you experience it for yourself. This movie is one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen. It chilled me to the bone, absolutely floored my emotions, and made me think about life more than any movie ever has. There is very minimal dialogue, but an infinite visual story. There is purpose and meaning with every shot in this film, and there is not one shot that does not woe the eye. An individual scene that stood out was the pie scene. I read about it a few times, and the director told Rooney Mara to eat as much of the pie as she could and once she felt like she had eaten enough, they would end the scene. Well she clearly pushed herself as hard as possible, creating an emotionally and painfully draining almost five minutes. It is a disturbing, realistic, and depressing scene. But, it is pure art. A scene like this is such a rarity, and it should be studied for many years to come. The concept of time comes up quite often in this film, as we see time jump around consistently. It was an interesting decision to jump through time so much, but it definitely worked in my opinion. The only part that I thought was pretty unnecessary was when our ghost (Casey Affleck) went back in time to the pilgrim era, and when the family was killed by Indians. I think that a cut from him jumping off the building to sitting on the kitchen floor would have worked just fine. But that is such a minimal scene it doesn't affect my rating. I wanted so badly to give this film an A+ and 10/10, and I got what I wanted. This is a deep movie, that makes the viewer think about what time and love means to us. Such a wonderful experience. I absolutely recommend this film. I definitely will watch this one again, and will be one of my favorite films to date.",A Ghost Story

The slow and meditative flow of A Ghost Story is what I wanted when I was tired and bored. The nothingness gave me the space to think and to understand the characters.I feel that I appreciate A Ghost Story for what it was trying to be, and I don't think A Ghost Story was great. It's OK.

404,redeyes-00202,Mediocre... depends on your tolerance for art-house films,5,17 November 2017,"I'll start off by saying I have a pretty high tolerance for art-house, slow-moving films. But if lack of action, dialogue or story bores you to tears, you'll probably hate this film.I didn't necessarily dislike the movie, but I simply found it 'okay'. There are some nice shots, it has an interesting premise, but it simply went on too long.Basically the concept is a 'What If' scenario... what if the afterlife all one can do is observe their surroundings. Or basically observe, discounting thrown dishes and flickering lights.And the problem of course is it'll be monotonous. As a philosophical question, it's interesting... but actually watching monotony isn't quite as interesting. Very little dialogue, very little plot, and several scenes don't quite have the impact they should.The followup scenarios with the Spanish family as well as a pretentious 'philosophy of nothing matters guy' were a little disappointing. In fact, the speech of the followup tenant (again, I'll call him 'nothing matters guy') is the point where I felt the film was trying too hard ... trying to be weighty and deep, but it came across as forced and pretentious.And I'm not sure if it's just me, but I'm getting sort of tired seeing Rooney Mara basically play the same exact role in every film she is in -- the sullen, brooding girl. Here her big scene is eating a pie. And if that doesn't sound so thrilling... well, it isn't. Affleck does a good enough job, but he's barely in the movie (discounting the sheet version).Anyway, some interesting ideas, the time-loop idea wasn't bad, the overall idea wasn't bad, but it'd make a much better 45 min film than a 1.5 hr one. It comes across as if Terrence Malick was told to make a horror film... I expect this is what it'd look like, more or less.",A Ghost Story

The DP did a great job, the story is complex, and this movie can bring you to tears when you watch it with patience.
It is incredible how this movie forces you to think about life and death, and does give you a special view about death.
I also really liked the music, which wasnt used that much, most scenes didnt even had to be underlined with music because they were powerful enough without it. There is a good reason for the critics giving it a 84 total score, man if you aren't patient enough for this movie, you should not judge artfilms at all, because you are missing some very important things aspects in them.

Except here, they do these wearing the morgue's bedsheet. That's it, that is the film in a paragraph. There is also a mukbang in the film where the wife stress eats a pie her friend leaves for her after the death of her husband. Makers tried their best to initiate that feeling of helplessness of the dead and death but ended up being hilarious and bad. Three of us watched it, one of us left the movie after 30 minutes to watch some scary youtube videos in order to compensate for the obnoxiousness of the said film, the second person literally got a headache and nausea due to the movie being extremely slow and dark.

Clearly, the producers couldn't afford the star's day-rate, so most of the movie features a manikin draped with a sheet. Or at least I think it's a manikin. It doesn't move. Nor, for that matter, does anything else. The whole movie seems to be a still photographer's first stab at movies, with never-ending shots of nicely lit still life scenes, with no emotional resonance. The movie only becomes interesting 3/4 in, when at least the camera starts moving. Then we finally get the majority of the film-makers' words: an endless bloviation by a cynical hipster about something that the writer pulled from a college journal.In the end, the movie's message is that ghosts are petulant twerps, haunting is a monotonous chore, and time never ends.

The movie then turns into a ghost simply watching different people live in his house as time passes and passes with really no storyline and no connection at all to his wife. After the second family moves out the house is demolished and the husband ghost time travels?? I really didn't understand this and why we needed a history of how the house got there and what it became. This movie isn't about ghost at all it's about a house and maybe a deeper meaning of how humans never really change. It's not a bad movie just poorly described with no suspense or any thing to it really.

The sadness of it's ""eye's"".I was hoping for a 2001, or The Seventh Seal, or even Moon, I thought that's what it was kind of aiming for.

This is a just-watched-it review which feels a little risky for this movie.There is something affecting that I liked about the movie but I'm hard pressed to say what. Yearnings, loss, loneliness. Acceptance and death? After the very long journey we get to an ambiguous ending that for me was very unsatisfying. Perhaps the writer painted himself into a corner he didn't know how to get out of.There are a few aspects of the movie that scream ""low budget"" but only one involving a couple of vehicles really bothered me. The supernatural metaphysics seemed consistent. A couple of early scenes are slow to the point of feeling that the director was self indulgent. It might make a kind of intellectual sense to present those scenes so slowly but it wasn't much fun to watch.The main character's motivation remains a cypher to me. While the journey held my interest and I was very much ""with"" the main character I didn't like or understand that one very much.

All of our vaunted achievements will crumble to dust in the long run, so why try at all? Considering it's by far the most dialogue-laden scene, these words are presumably meant to reverberate through the rest of the film, but they really don't. Observing this speechifying is Casey Affleck's eponymous ghost, a former occupant of the house killed in a car accident, now a roving bedsheet with two holes cut out. Outfitting the protagonist in a bedsheet for 90% of the run time is a bold choice in a film filled with them. Many of the choices actually work. As the years pass by the ghost seems to become more and more detached from human existence and even linear time, cycling back and forth to the dazzling future and rugged frontier past. But he's rooted to the same plot of earth, woven into the fabric of the place. There may be no higher compliment to pay to a movie than to say it made me think, and ""A Ghost Story"" certainly did that. Ultimately I thought the lesson the ghost learns is about evolving beyond the comfortable and convenient, taking the leap of faith required to explore new worlds. It's a lovely film to look at and to listen to. I had no problems with the scenes that lingered longer than they needed to because I think the writer/director was showing how fractured time has become to the ghost. But the minimalist performances failed to draw me in emotionally. And there were some bafflingly wrong-headed scenes, such as the moment when the ghost throws a Poltergeist-style tantrum, trashing the kitchen. There's no need for the ghost to be that demonstrative and it's distracting.",A Ghost Story

All I could think as I tried to stay the course with this film is ""what a sad waste of talent,"" as both Rooney Mara and Ben Affleck have so much range to offer as actors and were so confined in this ""ghost story""... experiment.

It started out fine, though, I wondered why it held a static shot for so long with no action, dialog or music. I thought, okay, fine. I see it's wanting to be one of ""those"" films, which I like.But those kind of shots kept coming. Over and over again I became bored with watching nothing. I must have fast-forwarded this movie at least 8 times to get past the photograph I was watching in a movie. There was about 5 minutes of dialog within the first hour, then when the dialog did come, it was from one person who talked for 5 minutes. I liked what was said, and I thought the movie would rectify itself in the last half hour. It didn't.I know what this movie was trying to do, but for me, it failed miserably.

433,MickGuinn,"Worst Film I've Seen in a Long, Long Time",1,5 August 2017,"O.M.Ghost! This was the WORST film I've seen in a long, _long_ time!It was so bad we were giggling and cracking jokes during it (we were in an empty theatre that night—unaware of what audiences may have already known). I'm never one of those rude people who talks during a film, but we didn't know how to survive without a little humorous banter. Most frequently uttered phrase that allowed small laugh related releases: ""He's a very patient ghost.""{SPOILER—well, actually, ""RESCUER"" Alert— since you should avoid seeing this film!}During the long, _long_ scenes where NOTHING happens, we began suggesting that Casey Affleck probably had a stand-in for this ""art film"" since he was covered in a sheet 95% of the time. Apparently, Kesha (Jerry Seinfeld's pal) plays the only other ghost in the film, but she too is covered with a sheet (with a floral pattern, so we know she's female) so who's to know who's under there? This whole film feels horribly self indulgent and pretentious. It presents like an undergrad film school project where the student film maker has just studied Andy Warhol, Kurosawa, or a Jarmusch film backwards or something. The movie is littered with bad 4-5 minute scenes when _nothing_ happens. Nothing. The ghost just stands there. Okay. I get it. He says nothing, stands there for an interminable amount of time and we get to project our own thoughts and feelings on him. Done. Understood. Can we please move on now?We get to watch Rooney Mara eat an entire pie in one long shot that eats up 5 minutes of screen time, while her dead husband, the ghost, just stands there, unmoving, and watches the whole thing through a the sheet. I guess that's her actor moment when she really ""commits to the part."" After a couple minutes, it pulled us out of the film as we began to wonder about the actress and not the character she was playing with a blank face to match her ghost's. Does she throw up for real in the background?...Honestly, I feel like I'm living in Bizarro world when I read summary snippets like this one at Rotten Tomatoes:""A passionate young couple, unexpectedly separated by a shocking loss, discover an eternal connection and a love that is infinite.""WHAT?!. ""Passionate?!"" Where the hell was passion in this film? Even the 4-5 minute kissing and cuddling scene in the beginning was sterile, like an unthawed Ingmar Bergman homage. I love kissing and cuddling. We were bored out of our minds watching _nothing_ transpire between the two leads before Casey dies and turns into a ghost with that famously easy Halloween costume. Certainly didn't see ""love."" Plenty of ""eternal."" THAT's a promise the film delivers on! It's an experience in mind numbing eternity. You'll feel older leaving the theater.And with all of this ""undying love,"" why does Affleck's ghost offer zero comfort to his grieving wife? There's only one moment where he reaches out with sheet to touch her hand. The rest of the time he stands in the corner like a sad boy in 2nd Grade, shamed for some misbehavior. We see him get angry and flash the lights when she brings a new man back home. She finally moves out, and for reasons that are never clear, Affleck's ghost terrorizes a single-parented Latino family who buys the home. We're supposed to to assume he's frustrated or confused or sad because Rooney left? But he does so by hurling dishes against the wall in front of little kids and their Mom as they try to eat dinner. Assumedly it's to answer that questions that haunts us all, ""Why do ghosts throw things?"" Yeahhhhhh. Right.While Lowery's tale may be a horribly misplaced homage to foreign cinema or film school, it really felt like it robbed us of a couple hours we'll never get back. Why does it not surprise me it was made with only $100k? It could have been an interesting, half hour episode of ""Black Mirror."" There are some good shots of the ghost standing alone amidst rubble, and the strange flipping forward and backward in time to suggest a loop. There are even a couple of dry humorous moments when the absurdity of the white sheeted ghost just tickles. Sadly, these moments extend another 3-4 minutes too long, grinding all of the possible humor out of the moment like stereotypical Germans editing comedy.There are even 2 Affleck ghosts at the end of the film as if to suggest this time loop might keep creating ghosts for every one that finally translates into the beyond? Okay, that's interesting. There's the endless attempt to get the piece of paper that Rooney leaves for him in the door jam, but we never see what she wrote. Oh, I. get. it. WE are supposed to write whatever we think she wrote there! ""Hey, I'm okay. You can go now."" Can WE go now? ALL of this could have been done in 30-45 minutes. It feels horribly narcissistic and pretentious to expect an audience to sit through this unceasing indulgence. I have no idea what happened at Sundance when this screened, but it may be one of the rare downsides of legal weed. The anti-entertainment critics were in full force when they rated this film.I give it TWO, no _FOUR_ THUMBS DOWN.You've been forewarned. Please ignore the high Rotten Tomatoes rating. Something failed in the ratings system because when you read some of the ""positive"" reviews, they list these problems too. Perhaps it too reminded them fondly of film school?He's a very patient ghostit's unlikely audiences will be.Zzzzz.......",A Ghost Story

But to say that is to miss the simplistic beauty of this film.
With most love stories, confusion, a sense of loss and memories of what have been are at the forefront and this is where I think this film excels.

437,b-channell,A movie that tries to explore deep themes... but is painfully slow and unintentionally hilarious.,3,28 April 2021,"I'll be honest, I'm not sure where to start with this review. 'A Ghost Story' is one of those films where you try to follow along and understand the director's intentions and thoughts, but it's so painfully slow that any enjoyment of the film was lost to me. From shots that stay static for a full minute, to scenes that I found unintentionally hilarious, the pacing is so crushingly slow that it lost me in the first 20 minutes. There appears to be a plot somewhere in this film, and its overarching themes are ambitious. But I spent half the film trying not to laugh at Casey Affleck (presumably) hidden under a bed sheet with sad little eyes.By the end of the film, any attempt to analyse what I had just seen was basically pointless, based on the fact that I had lost interest in the first half. I can understand why some people like it (and definitely understand why people hate it.) This was just one of those occasions where the filmmaking decisions completely ruined the experience, and I ended up watching a comedy rather than some deep meditation of life.",A Ghost Story
438,maceman1220,I just don't know...,6,30 July 2017,"Okay, so this is my first review. I've been using IMDb for years now, and I've considered many times to write a review for various reasons. Finally with this film, I decided it was time. A little bit of back story. When I first heard about this film, I loved it. I loved that it was made in secret, loved the cast, the director, and I especially loved the concept. Okay I'm gonna start with the things I liked in the movie. First, the acting. Everyone all around does a great job, the stand out being Rooney Mara. She shows a fantastic range of emotion while at the same time having very little dialogue to work with. Everyone in the cast is great, but she is without a doubt who you remember. Second, the visuals. The cinematography on this film was beautiful. Simple as can be, but beautiful. And with the 4/3 aspect ratio it really added a sense of intimacy to the film and just overall greatly enhanced the feeling. Also great was the music. It was beautiful yet haunting all at once and really enhanced a great many scenes. I also appreciated the ways it tied in with Casey Affleck's character. Finally I still absolutely love the concept of this film. The simplicity of a sheet ghost is great and really grounds the film.Okay, now I move on to the trickier part. First off, let me say that I am not the kind of moviegoer who needs big bangs and lightning pacing to love a movie. I have watched numerous ""slow"" movies and loved them to death. I also have much love for art- house films. The themes they bring up and they're unique forms of storytelling can be highly intriguing. And this film does have that, make no mistake, I was very interested the entire time in what was happening and where the film was going. However I must also say, this film at times did bore me. The parts that stood out to me the most were A: the bedroom scene after they wake up from the piano. It went on for an awkward amount of time in my opinion and didn't really seem to be building to anything particular, however it was nothing compared to B: the pie eating scene. Now I understand what the film was going for in this scene, and it did pull it off. I get that in her grief she is stuffing herself, to the point of vomiting, with pie just to seal with losing him, but at a certain point, I realized that I was watching a 5 minute plus unbroken take of a woman eating pie. I think that both of those scenes could have been edited to like a quarter their length and it would have improved the pacing a bit.Also I feel like I should point out the party scene. I must admit that this is probably my favorite scene from the movie, however in a lot of ways it feel unnecessary. I think the man's monologue is really interesting, however it seems to be there mostly to explain the point of the movie to the audience, a point which is pretty clear without him needing to say it. Still my favorite scene, but does kind of stand out from the rest of the movie. Also apparently Kesha was in that scene, I had no idea, no real reason to mention that, just saw a bunch of people getting excited by it.I guess my biggest problem with the film is that I don't really get it. I went with a friend to see this movie, and he is even more into films like this than me. He loves breaking down philosophical thongs in films and finding deeper metaphors, but at the end we both looked at each other with same thought, ""I just don't know"". I'm not saying I think this film is bad. It has many redeeming qualities, but I just didn't really get it. That's probably more my failure as a viewer to understand the deeper meaning, but really I just didn't get it. I think it would be a fantastic conversation piece to discuss for a few hours, but on my own I really didn't get much out of it. I wanted to have a more emotional connection to the film and the characters, and really I didn't. I don't really know anything about them. I didn't feel that much sadness when he died, or watching her go through grief. I understood her feelings and did feel bad for her, but nowhere near as much as I wish I did.I do recommend for others to see this film. I think that many people will have many different reactions to it, and I think that a film like this has a lot of subjective levels for individual viewers to break down. I wish I could sit down and discuss this movie with the director just to get a clearer sense of what his purpose was with certain scenes.In the end I don't want to give a rating, because I don't think a number will properly reflect my feelings after having viewed it. I can't give it a high rating because I can't say that I really enjoyed it, but I can't give it a low rating because I recognize that it is well made film. I could give it a middle ground number like a 6, but I still feel like that isn't an appropriate rating. I guess to put it simply, this is a film that I feel I could greatly benefit from watching again, however at this point I have little interest in watching this film a second time. Take from that what you will, but that is as simple as I can put it",A Ghost Story

445,mpbyrne-49953,"Impossibly intimate in focus, yet infinite in scope",8,3 August 2017,"In perhaps one of the most admirable filmmaking choices of the 21st century, David Lowery chooses to creates the $100,000 budget, 90 minute ""A Ghost Story,"" after the success 2016's $70 million dollar Disney picture ""Pete's Dragon.""His 2017 effort is both thematically overwhelming, shrouded in grief and sorrow, both purely personal and comprehensively existential. It's best you approach the movie knowing as little as possible- it's simplistic approach to cinematography and composition creates and environment that is equally evocative and thought provoking. 'If the regular length of a shot is increased, one becomes bored, but if you keep on making it longer, a new quality emerges, a special intensity of attention.'Tarkovsky was the master of proving the validity of the above quote- but in ""A Ghost Story,"" Lowery takes ""long takes"" to a new level, keeping them somewhere between Tarkovsky and Tarr. His takes are never overindulgent or long for the sake of playing with time, although Lowery does plenty of the latter with such subtlety and detail that he simultaneously puts other films to shame while maintaining a personal, unique approach to the positioning and distance of the camera. He does not challenge us to contemplate ""what the imagery means to us"" on these longer takes, but rather what the scene is saying about the characters in it, what emotions they are feeling, and the place those emotions occupy in the grand scheme of things. As the relevancy of time dwindles and the scope of the film widens, we do not loose track of the intimacy which has occurred between the two (wonderfully understated) lead actors, but rather consider their relationships and our own, both our relationship to our fellow humans and our relationship to time, and the universe.Lowery's film is not meant to be subject to detailed analysis, or ""interpretation."" It is no impossibly convoluted Christopher Nolan screenplay which requires multiple viewings to truly ""understand."" His movies is not didactic, nor is it irresolute- it is expressive, in the way that only Cinema can be. His images speak clearly, occasionally punctuated by brief, ephemeral dialogue, or direct ruminations on loss remembrance, and significance. A film that as meant to be felt rather than wholly dissected, ""A Ghost Story"" presents incredibly realized film making on a small budget in an increasingly cliquish industry.",A Ghost Story

This film is beautiful. The classic sheet ghost look adds to the overall timeless feel. Its themes of the enormity of time are well stated and it's not an easy concept to put to film. Honestly, my only gripe with the movie is the first 30 minutes. It is really slow and somewhat dull for the first third of the movie, but once you get past the notorious pie scene it will pick up and the rest of the movie will fly by. It makes you think. When I saw it in theaters, I had an existential crisis for the rest of the day and I was amazed by the fact that a film was so powerful as to cause that. It falls into the more artsy category of movies so I can see why it would have a low rating on this website. Not everyone likes those types of films for, yet again, being too ""pretentious."" Rule of thumb, any artsy film that tries to teach you or make you think is pretentious, at least that seems to be the mindset of the general movie going public anyway.

Go figure.Secondly, when worded so nicely in that 'this story is about a young couple who ... (insert all the stuff they supposedly do such as buy the home and the wife experiencing the moments of life without him, etc.), it sounds great, only that's not true either. It shows none of this, but rather concentrates on the most menial of actions without ever exploring more of either their relationship with each other or with anything else. Literally, you get no back story and no ending, and even if you did, you have nothing to hold the two together besides scenes of total mundaneness and dull, boring, tediousness. I will admit that there are a couple of laugh out loud moments. The problem is that given the tone of the film, I don't believe these moments are supposed to be funny, which makes the film that more awkward.In closing, one of the reviewers before me said it best: you have been warned.

I really wanted to like this film as well, It had a talented cast of people working behind it and a seemingly emotional premise, but I couldn't help leaving the cinema disappointed. the film was full of too many scenes, where not much happened but they were stretched out beyond belief. for example, there is a certain scene in this film which I will remember for all the wrong reasons. in this scene M (Rooney Mara), comes home devastated following seeing her recently deceased partner. She receives a pie from a well-meaning friend, she grabs a fork, slumps on the floor and proceeds to stress eat until she throws up. All while this goes on, C (Casey Affleck) stands watching her. This scene lasts for about 6 or 7 minutes, which ends up feeling like an eternity. It was at this point were a few people decided they'd had enough, and walked out. This film wasted so much acting potential too, in terms of the two main actors (Casey Affleck and Rooney Mara). I don't get how people are even saying he did a great job, I mean its slightly disappointing that he went from giving one of last year's best performances in Manchester by the sea and has ended up in this film, were he is not able to show his real acting potential. Rooney Mara is wasted as well, as mentioned earlier her longest scene is when she stress eats a pie for 7 minutes. But I get it, this film is meant and wants to be different. But that's all I'll remember it by, and not the good kind of different for me either. Critics seem to love it though, as different seems to appeal to them. In fact, the split in quality between how your average viewer sees it and how critics see it is certainly present. For a film which has such a relatable topic (with the topic being about death, which everyone goes through and must deal with)the film manages to somehow make you feel disconnected from the characters. while the film had a quite serious ending, when the title card 'a ghost story' appeared on screen, people began to laugh at what a mess it was and how they had clearly just wasted an hour and a half which they'll never get back.IN SUMMARY: an excruciatingly boring plot, which is stretched, so some scenes, which in any other film would only be a minute long, are seven times as long. The plot is also told with too many metaphors because it's trying way too hard to be different. Disappointing acting performances, no development in the characters and very flat cinematography.

456,BornaTl,it's not for everyone but...,7,14 June 2018,"This movie isn't a 9 or 10, probably not even 8, but it's a well-earned 7 at least.
people are reacting somehow mean to this movie and it's mainly because as i said in the title it's probably not for everyone, it's not a every day movie.
though there are some beautiful shots and one or two spectacular scenes that make this movie worth your while.
Personally i like Casey under the blank sheet, it shows some kind of solitude and perhaps oblivion.Rooney's acting isn't something special nor bad, it's like medium 5.
I do recommend this to movie lovers.
p.s. the aspect ratio is 4:3 and makes this movie even more #not_every_day_movie",A Ghost Story

Its a story about time in the long run. Its tremendously moving and a great take on what happens after. I sincerely hope (like to think) the Prognosticator monologue is supposed to be played for the ridiculousness of how kids think they have it all figured out, too pretentious not to be on purpose, especially with this actor well in his 40-ies. ---At any rate--just skip that 4 minute scene / ignore it and this is truly one great movie.",A Ghost Story
458,DoomVlad,That one Futurama episode? They made a movie about it!,10,8 December 2019,"The episode from Futurama I am talking about is season 6, episode 7 ""The Late Philip J. Fry"" so full spoilers ahead both for the movie and the episode.
In the episode, the professor constructs a time machine that can go only forward into the future but not into the past - at one point, they go so much forward to the end of everything and witness a second big-bang and realize that the timeline just keeps repeating itself with all of its events intact.You will find that notion in this movie, at the end. But until you get there, you will be having a lot of 'aw's' and a lot of sadness to go through.
The idea of having a ghost be dressed up as a bed sheet, all white with no visible facial expressions, no dialogue, no voice, barely any non-verbal language is a definite plus in the context of this movies script. The viewer can project himself or herself onto the ghost, the ghost becomes a blank slate of an entity and you can experience eternity through it.Other people (most reviewers here) suffer from ADHD. And I mean that in the most serious way possible - there is a scene in this movie that goes on for 4 minutes of the main protagonists wife eating a pie, trying to fill that hole of sadness and emptiness after her husband died while the ghost (her husband) just watches, cannot do anything. This movie does not cut any corners in providing a glimpse of every day life and how mourning looks. There are no shortcuts, there are no gimmicks to trick you into seeing it.It is a slow-paced movie and it is not for everyone (take a look at these reviews, once again, you will see the utter anger and lack of time some people have yet they can watch a 2 hour and 30 minute movie about Space Wizards or Superheroes just fine because it has something to grab the eye, explosions and, honestly - more dialogue than this) but if you enjoy this sort of thing, if you enjoy movies that make you ponder the existence of life, our own short trip here and you like a somewhat twist at the end - I recommend you have a go at it.My subjective experience is all that I am expressing here, obviously.
I do not imagine there would be too many things wrong on an objective level, the only thing I found to bother me was the long snuggle-wuggle scene right at the beginning, I mean we get it, you two love each-other very, very much. I am not even mad about the pie eating scene which is only 4 minutes long and nothing happens besides the wife eating a pie and then proceeding to vomit because she ate too much, too quick.
But the movie is good bordering on brilliant nonetheless, I love the fact that it's so different, I love that it made me think, I love that it made me quite emotional and sad with its events, I loved the prognosticator's monologue at the party (although I did comment on this that he should've stopped and ended up on a high-note in the context of the party, right about when discussing Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, Ode to joy) I loved that this movie alludes to the theory that the Universe is so chaotic that it sort of makes sense everything would repeat itself after it died.
It left me with a bittersweet feeling and for me, once again on a subjective level, it was a wonderful experience.",A Ghost Story

Once a man started wandering around in a sheet I was a little tempted to turn off but I thought someone must be fairly confident in their filmmaking if they think they can pull this off. Alright, I thought, what have you got for me?I am glad I persevered because what followed was a slowly paced, artistic but ultimately touching movie containing some great performances and a fabulous song ('I get Overwhelmed' by Dark Rooms if you are interested).

Though it's so simple, it tells of a grande universal truth; things change, People move on and trying to hold onto the now is impossible but that dosent make it insignificant. The stunning scenes /music makes up for the lack of action in this film. It let's us get away from being overwhelmed with intense moments, fast paced stories and bask in another approach to a story. Something silently chilling and slow. My stomach dropped a couple times from the approaches of showcasing the characters.

Then, the inevitable chariot of time crushes it too. What is still there? Memories. And a small piece. A couple of words from the dearest person- they are a constant, a guiding thread along which the viewer blindly moves led by a spiral labyrinth of plot. They are a Beethoven symphony and they will remain when the Universe collapses or - much more prosaically - we - people disappear. But as long as we are here we will observe the harvest of others and our mistakes put up with the inevitable, go through the walls of prejudice until we find rest.And the film rests on this vague yearning of the soul. It is in the ghost from a house nearby and in an incomplete family and in an existentialist-minded bearded man and in a family of pilgrims that came to the wasteland to build a new life and in the rushing world of businessmen in skyscrapers and - in the end - in the hero himself with which the viewer personifies.

476,o-tipmson,A Ghost Story is the movie you've been waiting for!,7,19 August 2017,"After Hollywoods glamorization of certain themes, A Ghost Story explores grief in a creative and new light. After getting over the somewhat ridiculous sheet over Casey Affleck head for 95% of the film, you get an emotional, sensitive take on the passing of time and the place of one person in the world.This film explores a lot! If its not making you think about how your own life is incredibly valuable, its making you come to terms with your overall insignificance in the almost limitless universe, and it makes you sad, depressed, yet oddly fueled with burning passion to make your mark count and leave your legacy in time. As Director David Lowrey perfectly communicates, your legacy, as it were, will continue with your loved ones; family and friends are the center of our own personal universes.The lack of dialogue is refreshing, a far cry from exposition filled blockbusters. The pacing is slow, but dose not lack momentum and the pauses, if you take something away from reading this, its this; the pauses are where this film shines. It takes time to make you think about what is really going on, not just telling you; this story is one to think about days after viewing.So, go and see A Ghost Story, its a breath of fresh air in the best of ways,O x",A Ghost Story

It would have been interesting if we would have learned what he thought about her life and the lives of others who lived in the house; however, except for one family who had children, we don't really know.

Shallow and unoriginal.While most scenes were slow, two were achingly slow: the scene in bed at the beginning and the pie-eating scene. ""Just eat the pie, please."" There were two other scenes in which our ghost ""communicated"" with a ghost in another house. The audience I was with laughed out loud.

After seeing the Plugged In review for this film, I cautiously threw this movie in on a slow, Saturday night. I assumed that it was going to be much like the movie ""Ghost,"" and that it would be good, but not overly amazing. I was so wrong.Not only did this movie make me cry for most of its duration, but it literally made me sob so hard that I was afraid of waking up the rest of my family is I cried in my bedroom at 11:45 at night. The film just hits so close to home. Time is the enemy of everyone. There's no going back, and there's no stopping it either. People pass, relationships end, romances form and then break apart. Nothing, at least in our physical world, ever stays the same. This movie beautifully illustrates this in a way that most American audiences don't seem to be understanding, which is why I am writing this review.This movie deserves so much more recognition that it currently has; especially on this site. While this is by no means an action-packed or on-the-edge-of-your-seat film, the pure amount of artistry and raw, unadulterated emotion found in it makes stand out in my mind as one of the best films I have ever seen.It's so simple. So astronomically simple; and that's what makes it so magical. Whether it be the haunting image of a wrecked car or the heavily-spoken about scene depicting a woman eating an entire pie for over five minutes, every single shot is filmed with so much emotion, it makes you want to pause the film and reflect on every minute the story has to offer. Everything has a purpose in this film. It all ties together in this beautiful, haunting tragedy mixed with a love song.I know I'm just a kid. Yes, I may be only seventeen. But I beg you, if the reviews for this film on this site are making you think twice about seeing this, just listen to what I have to say and watch it. No, it's not for everyone. If you're looking for a horror movie or a blood-splattered motion pic, skip this one over.

""Nothing written there would mean anything to the audience at that point, and it would just complicate that moment - you'd see something, process it, and then wonder what it means."" - Now that is the official ending. Geeez, what a let down. I guess I thought ghosts (as depicted often in literature and now days in documentaries) haunted places due to tragedy and grief linked to the soul doing the haunting. In this we see a note being placed, a lover dying accidentally and another love leaving for a new life. We all know that often these events in life will pull us (often) into the thoughts of the past. So it goes without saying that the ghost should REALLY have been Mara (the wife).",A Ghost Story
500,ptzv,I can't believe the ratings,8,30 December 2019,"I know it is a slow movie, but all of the scenes are worth it. (Except maybe the scene of the girl eating the cake for like 3 minutes)
A ghost Story is a great tragic love story, which plot is both, fictional story with realistic situations and feelings. The man lost his life and stays where he wanted to stay, he never wanted to leave the house. He also, never forgot about the girl even though she had already left, and he never sees her again.
It is great how they tell a ""fictional"" story without any special effects, they just keep it simple. And the photography and image are really cool, the warm and cold colors in the sky, the house, the view to the other ghost's window, all of those have an special color palette.
Also I think it was quite cool how he only watches and doesn't say anything, he only communicates with the other ghost.",A Ghost Story

What I dislike more than some scenes being way too long (pie scene hehe) is the scene where this guy explains the whole philosophy and idea of the movie instead of having audiences take something personal away from it. It just seems so out of place from the rest of the movie. Speaking of audiences, the general movie goes will hate this movie and I can see people feeling scammed if they spent money seeing it. It has moments of brilliance but I just can't help but feel like it'd be better of as a short movie. A movie that handles death and the fear of being forgotten better in 2017 is Coco.",A Ghost Story

But this movie broke me, I watched this film and looked at how I could do things better than the filmmaker himself. Which of course is ridiculous, they know what they were going for and I dont. But I feel like maybe cutting quite a few scenes, maybe adding some dialogue, maybe cutting the cringeworthy monologue by dude whose far too young to be balding that much; would help bring up the rating of this film more.

But the reason I'm writing this review is because I'm genuinely shocked by some of these reviews giving it 1star. From reading a bunch I gather about half the people who didn't like it watched about the first 20 to 30 minutes before giving up and therefore can only reference the pie scene.

Admittedly, I am an emotional person. I appreciate movies that make you think, and I also watched this alone which I feel is best. Yes, it is slow - especially in the beginning - but so worth sticking out.I thought this film was BEAUTIFUL. The long scenes that some viewers here complain about are just opportunities for you to feel the experience of love, loss, grief, etc.FYI: The pie scene was long, yes, but moving in it's authenticity. If you've felt intense grief, you'll get it. The end is not a disappointment at all - if you paid attention and understand the message.All in all, this movie is not for everyone.

517,the_mesmerizing_mrs-meloy,Truly a Work of Art,8,1 February 2020,"This film is unexpected to say the least. It's a pensive and melancholy journey. We live in a culture where ""ghost"" naturally means horror. However, in this movie we see that A Ghost Story is sometimes not horrific, but instead more like a love story. Full of passion, mistakes, pain, great personal strides and of course death. This movie is not for everyone though, it takes it's time with scenes, leaving lingering shots before the next transition. While some label this as ""boring"" I think it was instrumental in the audience connecting with the timeline that the spirit world and the physical world alike share. Sometimes things happen in a blink of an eye and sometimes it feels like years before a moment is over. Also the main characters are not named, this helps them resonate with the audience. You can relate more to someone and fill in your feelings and experience into the plot if you are not spoon fed these things by the studio. Questions that an audience might have while watching this movie are not answered, thus giving the viewer the opportunity to come up with their own answers and debate with others about their ideas.

The film is seriously well-crafted, having a mix of beautiful and interesting imagery coupled perfectly with top-notch sound design and score. A fair warning to potential viewers, this is a slow movie, so be prepared for long, stable shots. A benefit to the steadiness of the film is it provides the audience with time to mull over the details within the shots and how they might connect to the story and themes. I personally enjoyed the space the film gives to think and reflect about my own personal connection to these themes, and the philosophical ideas explored throughout can lead to great conversation with fellow viewers!",A Ghost Story
520,cheyannembaumgart,Well. This.,6,16 March 2020,"I am not artsy or pretentious or whatever in the least bit. I am just a human being.
Let me start with the pie scene. The scene that so many loathe so much. Well, I guess I will speak for someone who has a binging and purging eating disorder which is triggered by stress. That scene shattered my heart into so many pieces. I was brought to tears if I'm being honest.
The simple sheet to me was so much more effective than any stupid cheesy CGI has been in horror movies. Although, I wouldn't really classify this as horror. Losing someone you love is horrific but this is not ""horror"" in the classic sense of the genre.
The flashback to when he showed her a certain song and then it flashes to the present of her listening to it alone now after him passing. I got choked up.
There is barely any dialogue, which didn't take away from anything in my opinion. But the visual aspects and cinematography weren't very good most of the time. Scrapped points for that. Also. The man with his speech at the end cracked me up because I have heard so many people at parties saying things just like that. My goodness. I got so annoyed by him. He seemed like a person on drugs telling a story that I've heard so many people on drugs tell so many times over. Listening to it I thought; oh yeah, I've sat through this high bs many times lmao.
The ending is truly haunting when our ghost sees their home turned into some kind of complex and attempts to kill themselves over again. They then end up in another time period. Kind of a weird cool thingamajig.
The ghost watching his lover with someone else at the very end will touch your soul. Being dead and watching them fight, have sex with, live daily life with, and everything that comes with that. With someone else.

A true auteur's film, if you hated The Tree of Life and find Terrence Malick incredibly wanky and pretentious, then this movie is not for you. There is hardly any dialogue and most of the movie consists of long static shots with (almost) nothing happening in the (reduced 1.33:1) frame. A quiet, introspective examination of existentialism and the forward march of time, this movie speaks to me on a philosophical level that very few other films (if any) ever have. Technically it is a masterpiece and I was hooked from one of the very first long, static shots, which must run about 5 minutes and all that happens is She rolls the garbage can down the long driveway and walks back to the house. For five minutes. The camera doesn't move. I couldn't look away. If you are fascinated by the camera and appreciate technical directors you will find alot to love in this movie. David Lowry found a solid place on my best directors list with this film. If you need to watch something with a plot, and characters and conflict, don't bother with A Ghost Story.

For instance, the lead character was there and then we jumped to the auto accident where he is killed, no explanation of what actually happened. The rest is just plain confusing. The ghost communicates with a neighbor ghost with subtitles. He does some poltergeist stuff when new families move into the house. He reads a note his girlfriend has left behind without showing the note to us, then he vanished. He goes back in time to watch a family get murdered by Indians and hangs around until they rot. Why?

536,steeve-520,A Ghost Story uses old plot devices and disguises them with a white sheet,6,19 July 2017,"A Ghost Story begins as mundane as any other film about a couple - the couple, Casey Affleck as C and Rooney Mara as M, lounge around the house going about their daily routines as two adults.Shortly after the film begins, C's life comes to an end. Writer and Director David Lowery ends C's life not with a murder or some sort of catastrophic event, but with a car accident outside C and M's home. C is now a ghost confined to his home under a white sheet and is invisible to those around him.Following C's death, Lowery creates some of the most poignant and heartbreaking scenes I've seen in a long time. Whether it's M eating until she is sick or trying to find some way to connect with her dead partner, the film does an excellent job trying to show what it might feel like losing someone you love.For the first 1/3 of A Ghost Story, Lowery connects with the audience by focusing M's experience as she grieves the loss of her partner. However, when M moves out of their suburban home the film starts to bite off more than it can chew.The film introduces a number of characters that begin to change the tone of the story. For the remainder of the film, A Ghost Story becomes much louder with its futuristic and existential ideas. The 2nd and 3rd act ultimately has the film stray away from its core focus: love, loss and death.The film ends with us experiencing C's journey through time with a story line with many resemblances to recent science fiction films like Arrival and Interstellar. It's here that A Ghost Story loses its impact due to Lowery's attempt to make some grand statement about how vast (or possibly minute) the universe is.A Ghost Story had the potential to be a great film about human existence, but Lowery only successfully scratched the surface. What we end up with is a film that brings the same answers to the table as so many other films have done in the past - Lowery just puts a sheet over your eyes to fool you.",A Ghost Story

538,urcustomer,"Challenging, yet for me, rewarding movie",8,29 September 2017,"My tastes in films are rather eclectic but I'm generally more satisfied with something more thought-provoking then the general banal fare. I typically find foreign (read: not big Hollywood) films more satisfying. Not that I don't like a Marvel thrill or great CG flicks...I do. But to be memorable for me I have to be intellectually challenged at some level.Think 2001, Cloud Atlas, Prometheus or even A Clockwork Orange. These all, for me, required multiple viewings followed by weeks, months, years :) of rumination to come to a conclusion with regard to a sense of satisfaction. I used to read things to help get more insight into a film...today, it's google/internet that sheds light on these things for me. So, like a dog with a bone I'll delve into a film's background/screenplay or book source for direction.This title at first put me off as *a spook story* and avoided it until I read more about its premise at which point I was intrigued.As mentioned, it took a couple of viewings and understanding the *methods* used by the author/director to present the the story. How he dealt with showing time passing ever-so-painfully slow then jumping around. Of course, for a viewer it can be uncomfortable...but then, that's exactly the point! Are you somehow intruding or seeing something you shouldn't?Where was this all going...well, for those that have not yet seen this film I would suggest viewing the trailer a couple of times. For me, after I have viewed the movie, the message is all pulled together in the trailer.Upon subsequent viewings more was revealed that I had not noticed...nuanced actions or just how scene cuts were made all play into it's message.However, even tho I think I have a good feel for the film's intended message I think the message *can* be what the viewer makes of it. Almost a personal thing...like it was for the main character of the film.Go ahead...watch..be challenged...think a little. Or, if that's not your cup of tea, go for something more *in your face*.

There are incredibly long, mundane scenes, but these scenes exist for a reason. Time is experienced differently depending on a state of mind. If you are hyper-stimulated, going through personal acute trauma, time seems to move quickly. But strip away the distractions and emotion to just witness the physical existence, and time is a tedious thing. While eating the pie, M will not have experienced it so tediously, in fact you can see from the way she eats quickly and forcefully that time is moving very fast for her, she is spinning in pain. For C, time is crawling. He can only watch as every minute goes by in a state of purgatory. The mundane crawl of time is so devastating that the ghost C meets through the window has forgotten who it is waiting for. The experience of yourself in time, and your perception of time, is meant to be considered. You should allow yourself to feel the impatience of too long a scene, whilst noting that the character you are watching does not share this feeling of wasted or tedious time progression. Because the state of existence is changing from bound to the human body to ethereal, perception of time in the state of watching/witnessing v doing is an important dimension.",A Ghost Story

Unless you speak ghost you have no real insight as to what is going through the central character's mind. I still think several scenes ran on too long. We could have gotten to where the movie eventually goes in less time.However, dear movie viewer friends out there, stay the course!This movie does pay off. I went from thinking this is a terrible peace of crap and wondering if It really was Casey Affleck under that Charlie Brown Halloween costume to finally getting it. If you've ever felt a lost loved one's silent, fleeting presence in the middle of the night then this movie will resonate with you. It really becomes quite poignant and sad as it goes on. What happens when people die? Are they really gone? Perhaps some lost souls linger. They are neither here nor there. They can't make it to the next world nor come back to the world they once knew. They see all but are invisible. They are stuck. .This is a story of one of those that got stuck. This is a ghost's story.",A Ghost Story

I just sat through an hour of eating pie and watch ghosts nod to each other, completely in the dark to what was happening.I'm a huge fan of indie movies and saving the big reveal for the end, but if over half of the movie is painfully boring, I can't call that a good movie.",A Ghost Story

549,chaselosey,You Can't Watch This Like A Regular Paranormal Movie,9,10 April 2020,"When you watch this film, have a glass of wine and the bottle ready. Sit somewhere comfortable with a blanket. This is a patient film that has all the time in the world, because it is. You're not going to take anything out of this movie if you don't put yourself into it - it's not Poltergeist nor Ghost. Allow this movie to hold your hand through its silences and bring you into a new perspective of our world and how it deals with life and death and the mundane and grief and parties - time. Notice it's congruences, what things seep from the past and into the future and back to the past. Laugh at the fact that the ghost is in a bed sheet because it is comical and gimicky, but when you judge it do so critically and ask yourself why it is and what that says about how you should treat this spectre and the concept of what this ghost is in the film.
This movie is a masterpiece if you let it tell you it's story without expecting to be thrilled and exhilarated like most paranormal movies will (or will try to). However, from its subtleties I felt afraid and I felt sympathy and grief. I'm going to be thinking about this film a lot over the next few days as it lives in my bones.",A Ghost Story

551,ckelly331,Slow with interesting bits as you go - like life,7,25 October 2019,"I don't typically write reviews, and not many will read this for a movie that came out two years ago, but oh well.A lot of people say this movie is slow and boring and has long shots where nothing happens, and they're not wrong. It shows the mundane aspects of life, grief, and technically death. Yes, Rooney Mara eats a pie for five minutes. It's bizarre, long, and a strange thing to do. But her husband had just died. Her life is in a tailspin and she wants to eat some bloody pie. It makes me think the main issue people had is that this movie is not so much trying to entertain you, as it is trying to portray something that everyone will eventually go through. She's not eating the pie to push the plot along or say anything, just like people don't do things to progress the plot of their everyday lives. It's average. So people can connect to it.People also say there isn't a plot, but that's just not true. The plot is the two sentence blurb. There's a couple in a so-so marriage. The husband dies and becomes a ghost (represented by the most average image of a ghost in popular culture) watching and waiting for his wife. That's the plot. We watch that happen. Nowhere does it claim to be exciting, or dialogue driven or anything else. This movie is exactly what it says it is.If you watched the trailer and it intrigued you, then try it. As of writing, it's available on prime video. Just know that this movie is more focused on building an atmosphere and a feeling inside or you, than it is on telling an exciting fast paced story.The shots are long, and gorgeously staged. The music is fantastic and ethereal. The acting is quiet, subdued, and moving.If that appeals, then go for it. If you think it sounds dumb, don't watch it.

565,ChrisO81,Worst film I've ever seen ...,1,25 October 2017,"Getting through this film was honestly a real challenge. About half- way through the never-ending pie scene my wife and I turned to each other and laughed, she apologised (it was her choice after all), ""something is bound to happen sooner or later, let's just wait and see"" I said. Wrong! Absolutely nothing happens of significance over the remaining 50 minutes or so. Furthermore, it transpired we were no where near 'half-way' through the pie eating, 'M' hadn't even slumped to the floor yet. As to the longevity of this part, other reviewers have articulated that well enough, personally once I'd progressed through various stages of anticipation and then boredom I ended up dwelling over her poor eating technique and the damage she may be doing to the non-stick lining of the tin, especially as it wasn't even hers to begin with.My advice would be to walk out/switch off at this point just so you can say you got through this infamous scene. Maybe you're one of the lucky ones and you experienced a kaleidoscope of raw emotions, a commentary on the meaning of loss and life, or whatever. Most of us just saw a women eating pie for an insulting length of time, she was a bit upset but between the huge mouthfuls and cheeks full of food, inconclusive whether it had anything to do with 'C' or more likely just the realisation that for this scene she had to consume the whole damn *sugar-free, gluten-free, vegan* chocolate pie.The greatest enjoyment I got from this experience was reading the reviews here immediately afterwards, especially those espousing the scope, beauty and reflective qualities of this 'masterpiece'. It would certainly be a boring world if we all thought and interpreted everything the same but in my opinion this film is an insider joke and the positive commentary is a case of the Emperor's New Clothes.",A Ghost Story

567,bredatle,Don't believe the ratings for this movie.,1,27 April 2018,"I did, and was truly disappointed. And bored. In the Trivia section, it says: ""In the Pie Scene, it takes Rooney Mara from the time she sits down and starts eating to when she can't eat no more and runs to the bathroom, exactly 4 Minutes! ""
I wonder how David Lowery stretched it from those 4 minutes to the 10 minute scene he put in the film? That was possibly the one and only SFX used, for all I know. And is there really an actor under that cheap Casper costume the whole time? What a performance !How some can rate this film above zero is beyond me, (apart from 1 being the lowest possible score to give on IMDb) because this may be by far the worst snoozefest I've ever seen. And here I was thinking Tree of Life was bad... it is a masterpiece compared to this. 
The scenes are much too long thoroughout, and when they don't even give you something to reflect upon, some deeper meaning, well... then what is the point?Granted, the filming is sometimes quite good. Having something to actually tell with it would have been just great. For the better part of A Ghost Story, I struggled to see what the director wanted to convey. When it ended it would have been nice to get some kind of closure, like knowing what the heck went on. But I guess the audience was left as unsatisfied as the Ghost was. 
And why the 4:3 format ? Mildly irritating at first until it became really annoying.What triggered the producers to make this movie, I wonder? The full script can't possibly be longer than a couple of pages. Turning those few pages into 92 minutes of film is truly amazing. Just sorry intelligent people have had to sit through this drivel. There should have been an apology included at the end credits.",A Ghost Story
568,Gregrathie,"Experimental, Thought Provoking but Flawed",7,26 January 2019,"""Dialogue should simply be a sound among other sounds. Just something that comes out of the mouths of people whose eyes tell the story in visual terms""-Hitchcock.Indulgently long frames and flowing camera work add an element of initial suspense -perhaps from an over saturation from Hollywood- but eventually change to a ruminative aura once one feels safe.Most of the film involves single character performances. Casey afflecks unblinking black-hole eyes watching his love, his home and time revolve by. The mad guy whose college-dropout-style philosophy lesson at a party fell more towards cringeworthy platitude than towards profound, perhaps this is excellent true to life writing. It's hard to tell though.The 4:3 ratio, large format camera film style (I'm ignorant of the correct terms but you get my meaning) is a bold choice but a successful one. It adds an other-worldly feel to the movie, it's a style out with time.Films should be about what you see in them, and not what they tell you. It was an existential crisis, a love story and a concept piece.However the direction was in parts, strange. It could've been equally powerful had we never met Casey affleck alive. Also the 'end' sequence where he goes back to settler time and back through to present was sort of 2001 Kubrick-esc which personally fell flat emotionally and thematically didn't add much. Seeing himself as a ghost didn't make much sense, it was only to delay seeing the note in the wall which was more of a plot device and the director/writer David Lowery frustratingly didn't show the audience the note leaving a sour taste after 90 minutes of patiently watching.An excellent score adds powerful drama to the scenes, especially as the film progresses.",A Ghost Story

I didn't even have a serous issue with the pie scene being so long; I felt it was needed to emanate the deepest sadness that can be felt by a human at the saddest time in human life: death. However, I got confused once the house was torn down and the ghost seemed to travel through time. At the very end there was two ghosts in the house - the original one before C.A died and then I assume C.A was the second ghost at the end; but which one pulled out the note?

However, I have to warn you that unless you're willing to endure long stretches of nothing of importance happening, you probably won't care for this film. This is what happens when a director decides to make a work of art regardless of what the intended audience wants. Points awarded for trying.",A Ghost Story

604,ali_king-21202,It's worth watching,7,30 November 2017,"Alright, I can see why and how people would interpenetrate this film as pretentious but bare with it. This film obviously focuses on the grieving stage but more so from the perspective of the deceased which is quite an innovative angle. Parts I liked: The film uses creative camera angles with plenty of long shots taken from still angles, and from what I've read, there were many shots that only took one take to film. The camera adds to the dreary, depressing atmosphere David Lowery wants you to feel, after all this is a film about bereavement. Affleck and Mara deliver a solid, believably performance when they're both on camera together, which is no surprise as I believe Affleck is fantastic in all of his works. The ghost itself (also played by Affleck) is an interesting character to read. When watching I did start to feel a connection to the poor ghost who is left in a time lapse. There are some tear jerker scenes when it's evident the ghost (Affleck) just want's to comfort his bereaved wife. The ghost also shows anger when it witnesses it's wife close to another man. All of these aspects added to the character development of the friendly ghostly character which kept me interested throughout the movie. I noticed a lot of people are not a fan of the long scenes (pie scene) but I felt it added to the immersion of what life is like after losing someone close to you. I liked the pie scene in particular, it's a slow burner where you can see Mara's characters emotions building up as she starts to eat more and more aggressively until she ends up being sick, all the while our poor ghostly character watches over her. I felt this captured the numbness and pain Mara's character is feeling in this scene. As a final point for the positives, I felt the sound track captured the mood of the film really well and added to my experience. Things I didn't like: About halfway through the movie I started to lose interest slightly, mainly because the story leaves Mara's character behind and focuses on the location, i.e the house. I felt this took away the sentimental value of ghosty and Mara's characters connection, I mean, surly if ghosty can walk from the hospital to the house he could follow Mara's character, right? I didn't really care about how the house was knocked down or the squatters party scene, it's like the director wanted the audiences attention to be shifted from Mara's character to the house almost? I'm sure others will disagree with me but this is where I found my attention at this point in the film. When Mara's character comes back in I was sort of like 'Oh yeah, I remember her'. I felt the film brought out more of my emotions when it was ghosty following Mara's character. Conclusion: This film captures the struggles of someone graving fantastically and offers a unique angle from the dead's point of view which I really liked. It has plenty of scenes which you may need to bring the tissues out for, especially if you have just recently lost a loved one. I felt it lost it's way slightly and became a bit boring, however the story didn't take away from the cinematography which I think is great. The film requires you to feel a certain degree of empathy to the ghost to really feel what David Lowery was trying to achieve when filming. My overall score is 7 out of 10. I don't believe it deserves to be slated, however I can see why people would dislike this film. It's definitely worth a watch, if you're 50/50 about it, give it the first 40 mins and see how you feel. Also just wanted to drop in that I thought the casting of Kesha as the other ghost is probably the most bizarre cameos I have ever seen.",A Ghost Story

610,nla-75396,The director thinks he's Bergman and he's not,1,10 September 2017,"A pretentious example of a bad Bergman movie. The publicity uses the word ""meditation"" to excuse the fact that it has no characters, action, or plot. The scenes are static and frequently the only movement is the camera slowly zooming in or out. I suppose this is to give the movie an artsy feel. The message of the movie is that people die and times moves on. That is all you will learn, and if you didn't figure that out by the time you were fourteen . . . We learn almost nothing about the characters or their context. They mostly move and talk like zombies, which is a waster of some very good talent. Midway through the movie there is a long speech by an unnamed character I call The Gasbag, pointing out the obvious about life as if it were a newly discovered insight. It is really just a voice over that leads nowhere. None of the other actors in the scene react to it at all. When I saw it I honestly thought it was ironic, and the movie was going to satirize the genre of intellectually barren self-important indie files, but to my horror I discovered that the director was being serious. There is no humor in the movie, no humanity, no spontaneous moments. When you leave the theater you are not informed, moved, or entertained, just ground down. I compared it to another movie people often walked out of, The Tree of Life, but even though Tree of Life was overlong, self indulgent and badly edited, there was a compelling story at the middle.

I was so looking forward to seeing it because through the trailer I adored the way it had been filmed with the old fashion film look and it looked naturally and simply beautiful. I was not disappointed and adored the elongated scenes because it just showed the reality of living in this world filled with love and loss. The scenes emphasized the reality of just living and spending time with someone and being in the company of someone you love and miss. The film just showed a real life of a couple soon to be split from a physical being of a relationship, into a spiritual one. The scenes where relatable and I adored every minute and made me think about some things. I think this film is for anyone, however can appeal mainly towards the deep thinkers and people who enjoy hidden messages and thinking about what the director/ creator is trying to portray and it's fun doing so. I feel sad to hear that some people didn't give this film a chance, however, directors/ creators can't please the entire world as people are forever going to have contrasting views because we are only human...

This film moves me back to the days of being in film school and the works that would come out from those student creations.With a very close standard movie run time, there was very little dialog throughout. The director and cast are telling you a story, but leaving the blanks open to your own personal interpretations as to their meanings, and what thoughts they provoke. So 90% of the art of 'acting' was done through facial expressions, body movement, pauses in any type of action. Some of the parts are not really apparent until other pieces (as the director) takes you going back and forth in time are told throughout the entirety of the piece. All in all, it was at the very least a thought provoking glimpse into our lives and asks the question 'what does all this really mean in the end'. But does so in a way I've never seen attempted.If you're a film festival type that looks for non-traditional movies fair, you will enjoy this collaboration with Marra (Girl with the Dragon Tattoo) and Affleck.I gave it a 4 out of 5 overall.

And while I'd definitely agree with the former, I found the film far to simple and mesmerising to be considered pretentious.The movies first 30 minutes or so is definitely slow with extremely long takes with nothing noticeably important happening. And while watching each of these long takes you will definitely find yourself, as I did, wondering what the point of it is. But the film won me over one shot at a time, for example the scene starts, it's slow moving and honestly boring to Begin with, but by the end of it you see the purpose in the way it makes you feel and that's really what the movies about.Anytime I found myself becoming bored I grew to trust the film to win me back and show me that there was a purpose to what I just watched, and without fail the film always kept me interested in where it was going and I new it would find an interesting way to take me there.I often find that I can be a bit nihilistic in life in general and I definitely see (at least in my interpretation anyway) there's a theme of nihilism throughout the movie which honestly is probably why I enjoyed it so much and why I found it so entertaining. After the first 30 to 40 minutes the film does know that if it wants to keep your attention it's going to have to do something different, and it does. The shots gradually get shorter, there is eventually changes in setting and people start to come and go and things that are set up earlier get to show there purpose and give context to earlier scenes that at first may of seemed pretentious.This is a really hard movie to know who to recommend to so all I can say is give it a shot.

644,sear_linda,'Ghost' It's NOT,1,29 July 2018,"I found this movie on Netflix, thinking, 'ooooh, good, a recent movie out about ghosts, something I have a keen interest in. But GOD, it's slow to start, almost every scene there's either no dialogue at all, or very little-there is very little action to keep your interest. I was hoping for a modern day 'Ghost' (Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore) movie with a main character who suddenly dies fairly young, and how the woman he leaves behind deals with her grief, while eventually realizing that his spirit is still with her. Nope...this movie doesn't go into that kind of plot line. You will be struggling to continue watching, because it's one big dull bore! I found that the pie eating scene where it shows his widow stressfully eating a pie for 6-7 minutes ridiculously long. The sequence of scenes like this takes more than twice as long as a scene in normal movie scenes does. And once he 'rises from the dead' on the hospital gurney and after his widow leaves, he continues to wear the death sheet that had covered him, all throughout the rest of the movie. It's rather reminiscent of when Charlie Brown goes out on Halloween night in a ghost sheet, complete with circles cut out for the eyes. Ridiculous! It even stands looking out the window, sees a ghost also draped in a white sheet also looking out through it's house's window nearby, and they 'communicate' via sub titles.Other scenes are rather strange and completely disconnected from the storyline. Like when he's STILL in the house, STILL wearing the bed sheet, while a bull dozer is crashing into his house, long vacant and in major disrepair after he made the previous owners, a Spanish family leave after he did the usual freaky ghost stuff- hurling their dishes and cups towards them while they're eating their dinner. Then a minute later, the house is gone and there's a giant highrise that's built there where the house was.A minute or two later, he appears to go back in time and it shows a country scene that dates back more than a 100 years, and we see a pioneer family dressed in Little House type clothing. He just sits around in the ghost sheet observing them until the scene where they're all lying around dead with arrows in them, obviously massacred by Indians. Rather disturbing. And then fast forward to him sitting on the floor in his empty house. Like, HUH??!I think I could have written a much better ghost movie than this giant bore.

The message is could be conaidered profound but it is also quite simple and obvious for anyone over 15 years of age: the futility of life, the lack of trascendency, the inevitability of oblivion. A very heavy-handed direction remarking the obvious doesn't help the film one bit. It's pretentious and overrated. Wouldn't recommend it.",A Ghost Story
648,danilogud,Some nietzschean,7,27 April 2019,"I think that the film reflects the conception of eternal return of the same, however, not in the same sense that Nietzsche thought. Is kinda sad, but makes us think. I don't agree with some of the reviews that defend that the movie is poor. Is pretty rich in details and the slow timing is intencional.",A Ghost Story
649,teemuvalle,It's all about the state of mind,9,16 March 2020,"I found this movie really touching and emotionally triggering. I would say that this movie requires a certain type of person to really appreciate this type of movie. If you are into Jason Statham movies don't watch this. This movie is among the best I've seen in its genre. It's peaceful. Characters, specifically Afflecks character is well crafted and reflecting to the emotion of losing a loved one which this movie is all about. If you havent experienced that feeling you wont get the most out of it. When that kind of a incident happens in your life, watch this movie since it offers you the feelings you cant explain.",A Ghost Story
650,basbassie,"Unsettling, moving or boring?",7,29 October 2021,"First of all the mood and atmosphere the film creates with it's focus on cinematography is truly beautiful. The music fits the scenes perfectly as well.After seeing this movie it left me confused about the point the writers tried to make. Why let that poor women, a great actress btw, eat a pie for that long. Not to mention the scene where we had to painfully watch that women drag a chest to the street...Then it hit me and came to realise that everything, every fragment of this movie is made to make the viewer uneasy. Atleast this is my take on the movie.It is portrait in a long unsettling story about a ghost watching life happening and being ennoyed he can't interact. (Judging from the scene where he threw plates on the floor). He has lost emotions physically, which gives the viewer a hard time to judge his behavior, making you on guard for what comes next. This being amplified with the unpredictable actions he showed. The ghost always being there in shots, gives the viewer the feeling of being watched all the time aswell.The history of the family being killed and rotting away, the (Spanish?) kids being scared, the cold rigid office life and everthing happening on that piece of land, makes the house or piece of land feel uncomfortable. This gives the movie another dimension to its uneasy mood.The moment where Mara moves out gives the movie a nice break from being too static and let's the viewer know she has left the sombre atmosphere, showing nicely she exits the story.Is the whole point of this movie to make the viewer uncomfortable? Is that where the horror lies.If so, they sort of succeeded. Let me explain myself. It went at a pace where you adapted to as a viewer. Because of the lack of dynamic in this pace it became rather boring above anything else.It was still a moving movie to watch with great music and cinematography. Giving it a 7 out of 10.",A Ghost Story
651,zachsoniasummers,A Wonderful Catholic Perspective,10,3 March 2019,"I don't know if the director is Catholic, or raised Catholic, but this movie hit the nail on the head of depicting Purgatory in pretty plain terms without the smoke or frills.The man had the chance to enter Heaven in the hospital with the Door of Light and turned away because he was not ready yet. This echoes the Church's teaching on souls choosing of their own free will to purge themselves before entering the beauty of God.In Purgatory, one works out the consequences of their sins. What's his? Staying in the house, so he spends a seeming eternity in the house until he learns to let go.For those reviewing this movie as ""Watching paint dry"" or ""Watching grass grow,"" you're right but walk away not getting the point of the movie. It IS supposed to be like watching grass grow: you're working out every ounce of your problems before you can leave Purgatory. It's agonizing. Purgatory's agonizing.",A Ghost Story
