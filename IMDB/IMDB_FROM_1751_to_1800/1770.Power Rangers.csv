0,Leofwine_draca,Not bad for a big screen version of a TV series,6,7 January 2018,"POWER RANGERS is a big screen outing for the 1990s TV phenomenon and much better than I expected it would be given the usual quality of a Hollywood blockbusters. It's heavily inspired by the likes of PACIFIC RIM and TRANSFORMERS and yet it has a character all of its own, and it's chock-full of references to the TV series as well as Japanese comic book creations in general. The main good thing about it is that the cast remains likeable despite being young, fresh, and too good looking by half; RJ Cyler is a particular stand-out in this respect. The film gets progressively more and more immersed in CGI as the story progresses, but it remains light and watchable and funny at times. Elizabeth Banks threatens to spoil things with another over the top performance but thankfully doesn't have too much screen time.",Power Rangers
1,SnoopyStyle,not completely bad,5,15 July 2017,"The Power Rangers led by Zordon battle Rita Repulsa (Elizabeth Banks) to protect all life on Earth and the Zeo Crystal. They send Rita to the bottom of the ocean but die in the process. Sixty five million years later, Jason Scott is the star high school quarterback in the fishing town Angel Grove. His prank turns into a high speed crash and life time of detentions. He saves peculiar Billy Cranston from a bully. He goes to the quarry with Billy and finds former cheerleader Kimberly Hart. Billy finds alien coins in the rocks. Along with Zack and Trini, the five teenagers turn into the new Power Rangers.The five fresh-faced kids are perfectly nice actors. Billy is marginally annoying at times but the kids sometimes have good exchanges. The characters should start with better chemistry. They should probably do a Breakfast Club before going off on their adventures. They need to be friends before breaking up and the inevitable reunion. There are attempts at humor and plenty of CGI action. This sort of works until it doesn't.",Power Rangers
2,nogodnomasters,There Can only be one Red Ranger,8,15 July 2017,"The film opens in the Cenozoic Era with aliens coming to Earth. In New Age fashion, a crystal in the earth creates a life force. We shift to modern times and are introduced to three of the would-be Rangers in detention. We get to know Zack (Ludi Lin) and Trini (Becky G.) a little later. Perhaps the worst thing you can do is to share your innermost secret with a group of teen peers, but that is what they did in order to become a team and save the world vs. a Gold Golem.The younger you are, the more likely you will enjoy the film. It is aimed at the teen. It had great graphics, although the Alpha-5 was as convincing as the alien in ""Explorers."" Rita Repulsa (Elizabeth Banks) was a little on the cartoonish side and I am not convinced of her alien name.I was too old to have watched the MMPR so I can not make comparisons. I will say they simplified the title by dropping the Mighty Morphin' part, making it a bit more mature. Bryan Cranston was barely noticeable as Zordon.Guide: No F-words, sex, or nudity.",Power Rangers
3,kosmasp,Teenage Mutant .. Power Rangers,6,26 July 2017,"The actors themselves may not be in their teenage years anymore, but the characters they are portraying are. This is as Popcorn and light as it gets. We have Bryan Cranston as a sort of mentor figure to our lead group. And that group is of course unwilling at first. I have to admit here, that I have not seen previous installments of the Power Rangers, so I can't really compare. Even cameos from previous Power Rangers would have gone over my head, if they hadn't been pointed out to me.So there is stuff to look forward to, but it all is very easy going. It's predictable as expected, the CGI gets better every year and it's good in this one, although there's always room for improvement. Watch it, just don't expect too much",Power Rangers
4,classicsoncall,"""I'm pretty sure I'm a super-hero.""",6,18 April 2017,"For me personally, this was a movie choice of last resort with my two pre-teen grand kids tagging along. We had to whittle down our selection to a film no one had seen yet. So I missed out on The Smurfs and Boss Baby once again; maybe that wasn't such a bad idea. Anyway, this is not a picture I would have gone to under any other circumstances, and there's no obligatory admission here that it was better than what I thought it would be. The entire story is aimed directly at the teenage market with a rainbow coalition of characters that's even referenced by someone in the story as being 'different colors, different kids, different colored kids'. So the whole multiculturalism aspect is addressed here, with a nod to the idea that autism doesn't have to be a hindrance for someone who wants to be productive and make a difference. In fact, it was the autistic teen Billy (RJ Cyler) who first attained the morphing ability crucial to the teens acquiring their Power Ranger status. With a threat to the planet and a villainess bent on global domination, the latter part of the picture turned into a garish display of battle action and destruction on a scale meant to outdo the last movie that just came out, take your pick. The young teens win out naturally, with their message of misfits sticking together for a worthwhile cause. If you catch your fair share of super-hero flicks, you've already seen it dozens of times. For this viewer, I couldn't even count on a nostalgia factor in watching this film; even though the first Power ranger vehicle came out in 1993, my roots go all the way back to ""The Adventures of Superman"" from the Fifties. I guess I'll stick with the DC and Marvel films looking ahead.",Power Rangers
5,oscaralbert,As you watch the longest bakery commercial in Advertising History . . .,6,29 March 2017,". . . ""Krispy Kreme's"" logo seems to be on-screen during POWER RANGERS for more than an hour. The main villain of this flick is shown chowing down on one of the featured KK (or is it ""KKK""?) donuts an hour, 37 minutes, and 25 seconds into this yawner. (When's the last time that you've enjoyed a GOOD movie in which a main character lingered over a pastry that close to the climax? About the only Dunker Scene of note in the Annals of Film was the infamous shootout in BOOGIE NIGHTS, and that comes at the beginning of the show.) If I want to spend an hour at Krispy Kreme, I'll drive to one. However, I'm not so sure I'll venture over there again in the foreseeable future, because my last three trips saw me arriving with KK's logo lit up, which means my car load expected the promised ""free"" treat each time. Tragically, ""fancy"" filled donuts were rolling off KK's assembly line in each instance, and they say that they will only give away the ""original glazed"" ones for Gratis when their sign is lit up! In the field of Consumer Fraud, this is what's known as a ""Bait and Switch"" Gimmick. Anyone suffering this apparently typical KK experience must boycott BOTH Krispy Kreme AND Power Rangers!",Power Rangers
6,Wizard-8,Both too slow and too fast,3,29 September 2018,"I will give this cinematic adaptation of the popular 90s kids television show this: it is somewhat less annoyingly juvenile in tone as the television show. And the young actors who play the title characters show likability and talent. However, even their charm and efforts can't save the movie in the end, for the reasons I stated in the subject line of this user comment.Let me explain. As I said, I found the movie too slow. If you are expecting a lot of Power Ranger action, you'll be very disappointed. The build-up to when the rangers get into action takes forever, about 3/4 of the running time. And when the rangers DO get into action, the mayhem feels slower, clunkier, and more awkward than the action on the television show.Strangely, the movie is also way too fast at times. There are a ton of plot points that are not defined clearly, or are forgotten about and never brought up again. Also, the villain of the movie (Rita Repulsa) is given almost no development at all, making her a really weak and colorless figure. There are signs that despite the length of this movie (124 minutes), a LOT of footage that might have fleshed out the story and characters was ultimately cut out in the editing room.Adults who liked the Power Rangers as kids will probably be let down by this movie. Kids might like the movie better, but will probably outgrow it when exposed to better movie later. I say for either age group, stick to reruns of the television show.",Power Rangers
7,Mr-Fusion,A half-hearted stab at nostalgia mining,5,7 July 2017,"Two hours long and it takes them 90 minutes to finally don the costumes. That's the essence of ""Power Rangers"", a movie that offers plenty of buildup with a clumsy payoff. A lot of money and time went into the mo-cap, but there's something to be said about the fluidity of spandex fight scenes. And strangely enough, I think I liked it better while it was a generic superhero origin story, ""Breakfast Club"" archetypes and all. Even still, these are decent actors and they breathe life into a pretty weak script.It's funny, I was never a Power Rangers fan growing up (though I certainly put in the effort) but I didn't end up liking this movie because of the writing; too much effort turning this into a serious teen drama and not focusing on the goofy appeal of the show. It was silly then and it should be now.5/10",Power Rangers
8,siderite,Wasting good actors on absolute rubbish,5,10 August 2020,"I have not grown up with the Power Rangers and so I don't have any melancholy towards the story or the characters. I can only imagine it was a children's action series or something. I expected the script to be idiotic, but I also hoped for something fun. There was nothing fun, inspiring or funny about the whole thing. In fact, it was totally depressing. I almost empathized with the psychotic villain because everything else was so boring, bland or nonsensical.Watching a Hollywood movie based on superheros that sucks was not unexpected. Using actors like Dacre Montgomery, who did a good job in Stranger Things, for a character jumping around in pointless stunts while having no shred of personality was a crime, though. Putting Elizabeth Banks in the role of the villain opened up so many different potential doors; they closed and locked them all with a character so unidimensional that it hurt. She did a good job with it, too, perhaps just to spite them. And finally, Bryan Cranston, Mr Breaking Bad himself, the ranger (ironically) who sacrificed himself to end the Shadow War... as a face in a wall acting like a sporting couch.This film deserves no praise, not even anger, just pity and oblivion.",Power Rangers
9,Hellmant,"A good movie for kids, at the very least, and it shouldn't bore adults too much either.",7,5 April 2017,"POWER RANGERS': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The third installment in the superhero film series, based on the popular kids' TV show (from the 1990s). This one is a reboot that features new cast members, playing the main characters of the original TV series, with a modern origin story. It was directed by Dean Israelite (who also helmed the 2015 teen sci-fi flick 'PROJECT ALMANAC'), and it was produced by the series creator Haim Saban. John Gatins, Matt Sazama, Burk Sharpless, Michele Mulroney and Kieran Mulroney served as writers on the film; which also features a mostly inexperienced young new cast (including Dacre Montgomery, Naomi Scott, RJ Cyler, Becky G and Ludy Lin). The supporting cast also features Elizabeth Banks (as the evil villain), the voice of Bill Hader, and Bryan Cranston (who also voiced characters on the original TV show). The film has been a hit at the Box Office, but it's also only received mixed reviews from critics. I think it's a big improvement over the source material, but it's still nothing too special.The story begins on prehistoric Earth, when the Power Rangers (Earth's protectors) are betrayed by the Green Ranger, also known as Rita Repulsa (Banks). The Red Ranger, named Zordon (Cranston), hides the Rangers' powers coins (which are their power source). He then has his robot assistant, named Alpha 5 (Hader), cause a meteor strike; which wipes out Zordon, Rita and all of the dinosaurs (although Rita survives the blast, and so does Zordon's consciousness). In modern day, five misfit teenagers discover the power coins. They're then tasked with defending the planet, from Rita, by becoming a new team of Power Rangers, under the guidance of Zordon's consciousness.The movie is the most interesting when it's developing it's five teenage lead characters; and it definitely gets a lot of points for being the first major superhero film to feature LGBTQ and autistic superheroes. The story, and cheesy action scenes, are definitely a lot less interesting, and inspiring, than the teenage drama though. Those scenes are still pretty cheesy as well; although they're a lot better done than they were in the ultra-corny kids' TV show. I'd say it's a good movie for kids, at the very least, and it shouldn't bore adults too much either.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://vimeo.com/208412653",Power Rangers
10,FeastMode,my notes,7,24 July 2019,"Ummmmm guilty pleasure? yes. very fun and awesome, super nostalgia. lots of cool action, although some was flawed and sloppy. this is a fun mindless movie. lots of flaws and things you can make fun of but they didn't bother me because i was expecting it. and also because like the ninja turtles, some things can't really be done seriously in a live action movie. but i really enjoyed it. good music too (2 viewings)

other than the little things you can make fun of, my biggest flaws with the movie are that Rita was kind of a joke, and that they only fought in their armor for like 60 seconds. i woulda liked to see more of that",Power Rangers
11,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Go, go inappropriate joke!",5,12 March 2020,"This gritty reboot of 'Mighty Morphin Power Rangers (1993-1999)' has a bit of a tonal problem. 'Power Rangers (2017)' can't decide if it wants to be a dulled-down, hard-edged action movie or a bright, tongue-in-cheek throwback piece. This is disconcerting, to say the least. I mean, the picture has both a 'Transformers (2007)'-esque, teamwork-focused ending and a subplot about the non-consensual sharing of a teenager's 'nude pics' (perpetrated by a hero, no less). There are jokes about space robots, super powers and accidentally 'pulling off' a bull, scenes centred around outlandish stunts, combat training and the murder of innocent civilians, and references to pop-culture, power rangers and the bullying of an autistic child. I think you get the point. It's just so all over the place, at once deadly serious and incredibly silly, and it doesn't always seem to know which 'mode' it's currently in. On the positive side, the focal team is comprised of a diverse set of decently developed characters; no-one is left out due to race, gender, sexuality, disability or personal baggage. The finale is also surprisingly effective, especially - I suppose - for a big CG-based battle. It's not great but it's entertaining enough. I'll also add that Banks' Rita Repulsa feels like she's walked straight out of the 90s show. It's just a shame that only a few oblique callbacks follow her. For most of the movie, I was honestly cringing. It's generic, banal and forced, bland in the blandest of ways. Don't get me wrong, it's basically passable. I just don't know who it's for, really. It's too grown-up for kids but too flawed for adults. Its best bit is when the teens finally come together, draped in their technicolor armour, and deliver the colourful kung-fu cheesiness that most people expect with the brand. Unfortunately, this only lasts for about two minutes. 5/10",Power Rangers
12,ThomasDrufke,"Nostalgic, Silly Fun",6,27 March 2017,"Power Rangers is pretty much exactly what I pictured it being. Big budgeted movie, cheesy enough to please the fans of the old TV series', but mature enough for most ages to enjoy. There's nothing new or exciting here, but the execution was about as updated as you can make a film about 5 outcasts coming together to save the world as armored rangers.Surprisingly, the one thing I think they did a good job of balancing was the tone. I'm in the minority, but the revolving tone of the movie is exactly what I think the movie needed to have, after having a chance to view it. Because of what the Rangers TV shows have been, it's hard to both recapture the tone and reinvent it for new audiences. For me, this movie did a nice job of establishing a new generation of Rangers in a more serious world, without sacrificing the goofy humor that most fans love. Did the humor hit the way the writers hoped? Probably not. The cheesy humor, or lack thereof, is in part because of Transformers-esque writing, but it also could fall on the shoulders of the directing and acting.It's difficult to cast a movie like this. People have a certain vision as to who each Ranger should be and represent. I give credit to Lionsgate for making one of the leads gay, and one autistic, but I didn't find any of the Rangers to be all that interesting. While fine overall, the acting didn't add anything to the typically generic coming of age dialogue. That is, besides a few performances. Elizabeth Banks is great as Rita Repulsa, a mixture of over-the-top popcorn fun and creepiness. I also found there to be a lot to like about Naomi Scott as Kimberly/Pink Ranger. When all the chips are down and each Ranger is breaking down their backstory, she was the only one I found myself emotionally connected to. Perhaps aware of all the hate towards the more serious DC films, and love towards the lighter Marvel films, Power Rangers saves it's most impressive action for the final 30 minutes. In all its CGI madness, there's no denying how nostalgic and fun the ride is. Sure, I'm not invested in the characters as much as I would have liked, but it's sure as heck better than the Transformers and Ninja Turtles films. Serviceable is a nice way to describe this one.+Undeniably fun+Banks & Scott-Script-Nothing new and surprising6.5/10",Power Rangers
13,ericstevenson,"Not a fan, but I'll still watch it",6,26 March 2017,"I am impressed at how ""Power Rangers"" remains popular after all these years. I think I might have been a fan when I was really little, but I barely have any memories now. There really are a lot of good things about this movie but there are some parts that are just plain bad. I admit that the special effects didn't look too good from the trailers. On the big screen, they really are quite impressive! Seeing as how the show relied on stock footage from ""Super Sentai"", it really is great to see all new footage they made for this movie. I admit it's kind of weird to have a show known for being so campy be so serious here and grittier here, but it really did work well.I have to get to one thing that just weighs this film down like mad. An important part of the plot is that a crystal is located under a Krispy Kreme shop. Yeah, the continually show the Krispy Kreme logo over and over and it just makes it seem like a massive sellout. It's really some of the most blatant product placement I've ever seen in my life. Yeah, I am kind of in the mood to go there. This didn't need to be a part of the plot. If the crystal was in just some random place it would have made as much sense.It's also disappointing that the Power Rangers in full costume don't even appear until three fourths into the movie! Still, the battle scenes they did give us are fairly nice. I like the effect with Zordon and think Bryan Cranston was a good choice to play him. They even show a version of the awesome theme song. Again, not a fan, but boy is that a great song! Alpha is designed pretty well and I like his character. Unfortunately, it does seem like a lot of it is just an attempt for a long running series to stay relevant, but at least it doesn't rely on it that much. There's lots of good and bad things, but you should see it and judge for yourself. **1/2",Power Rangers
14,cricketbat,Amazing...ly dull,4,28 December 2018,"Power Rangers is amazing...ly dull. It takes forever for the ball to get rolling, and when the fun finally starts, it's not actually that fun. I wanted this movie to be worse, to be honest, but the actors aren't that bad and the storyline, though extremely predicable, will appeal to those who haven't seen it a hundred times before. This movie just suffers from some pacing problems and a severe lack of energy.",Power Rangers
15,lesleyharris30,"A Mess that Could have been Nostalgic Fun,",2,15 April 2017,"Power Rangers is an atrocious movie with a poorly developed plot and an disinterested cast. I did not have high expectations for this film, but I was a fan of the television series as a child and thought it would be a fun tribute. Instead of that, it takes what made the Power Rangers a hit in the late nineties and forcefully updates it for today's standards, taking itself far too seriously for such a ridiculous property. The majority of the cast are uninspired, clearly only there for a pay check. The Rangers, with the exception of RJ Cyler and Ludi Lin, seem to have no desire or ambition to act. The more A list cast do not shine either, Elizabeth Banks is far too sweet and attractive to thrill us as the lead antagonist, while Bryan Cranston just seemed out of place, which was a shame, as he could do so much better. For an action film, it is not very exciting. It takes up far too much time setting up the Rangers, followed by about twenty minutes of poor action sequences that are jam packed with CGI and poor one liners. I found myself regretting my decision to watch this movie more and more throughout. Dull and poorly paced, Power Rangers is too serious to be fun, but not serious enough to be intriguing, I would avoid this one. A group of teenagers use new powers that they have been bestowed with to protect the galaxy. Best Performance: RJ Cyler / Worst Performance: Elizabeth Banks",Power Rangers
16,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,5,18 June 2017,"Power RangersThe most important lesson Powers Rangers taught children was which colour represents which race.Sadly, that useful education tool has been omitted from this fantasy.When a disgraced quarterback (Dacre Montgomery), a troubled cheerleader (Naomi Scott), an autistic nerd (RJ Cyler), a lesbian loner (Becky G) and a momma's boy (Ludi Lin) unearth ancient colour coded coins they gain unimaginable powers.Aided by their new mentor (Bryan Cranston), his android (Bill Hader) and their vehicles that morph into a mega mecha, the quintet sets out to stop a former ranger (Elizabeth Banks) from finding the all-powerful Zeo Crystal. While this update of the Japanese super-hero kids' show manages to represent all races and special interests, its inconstant tone keeps it from telling an engaging story. The lack of mega-sized monsters is also concerning.Incidentally, the best way to keep colossal combatants off your building is to install massive bird spikes.

17,851222,Not bad flick,7,17 June 2017,"Greetings from Lithuania.In order for a movie ""Power Rangers"" (2017) to work and kinda deliver i think you need three main ingredients (or at least they worked for me):1. A boring evening with some good friends. 2. A ""leave your brain at the door"" mood. 3. Some light alcohol involved.I kinda found this movie to be not bad flick at all. It had some surprisingly very nice writing (for the material), some nice acting and humor which creates this ""don't get this to serious"" type of a mood. Although you still need to leave your brain at the door when watching this movie, i found it kinda involving. Sure this movie had to bring to a great Bryan Cranston the most easiest paycheck in his life but he does deliver simply by his voice - now this is a true talent. And while the whole plot of a second part of a movie could be summed up in a ""kinds movie - VERY young kinds movie"" line - it kinda worked for me - but those three above mentioned ingredients were involved. Not bad flick overall.",Power Rangers
18,westsideschl,Power Up Those Dollar Store Crystals,2,15 July 2017,"Positive: CGI good enough to entertain any mature under 16 teen & any immature under 21 teen. Everyone else, it's hopeless for you. Negatives: 1. This, and most of the other points indicate formula, already done a hundred times, story hooks. So let's begin with  2. Crystals that rule the Universe? And, they come in pretty plastic colors. By the way, do any of these writers have any education beyond 7th grade to realize how big the Universe is? 3. We need an evil one - right! In this case her name is Rita and she's like over 65 million years old, but doesn't look a day past 35 (she's going to like that). Rita likes to wear plastic Hollywood fantasy clothing with customary makeup to look ferocious. 4. Lots of excessively rational mind blowing coincidences in this movie like the five future heroes all show up at the same abandoned mine (and other places later on) at the same time. 5. Further coincidence, autistic spectrum nerd future hero happens to have some dynamite and happens to blow up the one location on Earth with the secret crystals. 6. Rita, coincidentally, happens to be dredged up from the deep ocean after 65 my looking only slightly bent out of shape (figuratively). 7. Dumb CGI of crystals levitating and vibrating and a tiresome old hook for mystery. 8. All happen to fall into a water hole that isn't all water, but does happen to have our alien spaceship and Transformer style dinosaur bods. 9. Happens to be a dumb (but they were trying to be funny) Alpha 5 robot that speaks English and has American juvenile humor and is also 65 my old. Calls our crystals ""coins"" for some reason and reminds everyone that ""The fate of the Universe"" is in the hands of teens; also known for their poor values. 10. Writer is doing the ethnicity hook (probably to get more monied viewers) of one ethnic for each crystal, ah coin. 11. Another attempt at humor is that Rita and Goldar (made out of guess what) are looking for the ultimate crystal of life which happens to be at the ultimate source of life Krispy Kreme. 12. Final scenes with dinosaur bots, swords (all this futuristic Universe saving tech and we're still using swords?), a slap (OK!) and wrestling (wrestling??).

19,ironhorse_iv,"This movie doesn't have quite the power as the original does, but it was decent.",7,6 April 2017,"Like the highly popular 1990s show distributed by Saban Entertainment (later Saban Brands), the movie directed by Dean Israelite & written by John Gatins with story by Burk Sharpless, Matt Sazama, Kieran and Michele Mulroney, tells the story of five teenagers with attitude: Jason Lee Scott AKA Red Ranger (Dacre Montgomery), Kimberly Hart AKA Pink Ranger (Naomi Scott), Billy Cranston AKA Blue Ranger (RJ Cyler), Zack Taylor AKA Black Ranger (Ludi Lin) & Trini Kwan AKA Yellow Ranger (Becky G) being recruited by the all-powerful inter-dimensional being named Zordon (Bryan Cranston) to save the Planet Earth from the wicked threats of the evil witch/former Green Ranger, Rita Repulsa (Elizabeth Banks) and her horde of monsters. Without spoiling the movie, too much, when, first seeing the trailer, I was somewhat skeptical on how, this movie was being presented. After all, I was very tired of seeing fake-looking CGI, horrible dialogue and heavy broody teenager storyline clichés story writing, whenever Hollywood attempts to reboot a beloved, pre-existing kid's show property onto the big screen. It had all the red flags. However, after watching this movie; I can say, the film was not that bad, but not great, either. A decent film with a really cool 1980s vibe electric synthesizer mixed current popular tunes soundtrack by Brian Tyler. Plus, I like how they fit the retro 'Go Go Power Rangers' theme song. And that's coming from not a huge fan of anything Tokusatsu! Yes, over the years, 'The Power Rangers' TV series has had many incarnations, and with that, came along many big screen movies ranging from 1995's 'Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie' to 1997's 'Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie'. However, it's safe to say, this 2017's reboot of the hugely popular '90s Fox Kids TV show is probably the best of the film series. It could even be, better than the original show. I know a many of you, are thinking, how could, I say that, since I call this movie 'only decent', but let me explain. The movie will never, outdo the popularity of the original show, the kid show was a 1990s pop culture phenomenon. An enigma that help usher, more Japanese kid's shows to US audiences. Although, this movie did outdo the original, in fleshing out the character, through character development and arches. The original show is full of somewhat racist stereotypes & awful pun-driven jokes, & unrealistic goodie two shoes teenagers who look nothing like their age. At least, in this movie, the characters were all unique and ground-breaking. After all, who ever heard of an artistic & lesbian ranger, before? While, some of their actions is indeed, not family friendly & somewhat clichés; at least, they seem like teenager dealing with angst, unlike the original. I love the redemption storyline, they were forced to go through. It made, some scenes like the camp fire and dock scene kinda heart-breaking. All the actors playing the rangers were great in the roles, even if they can be a bit annoying at times. Also, the acting in this film is a lot better than the original. While, the original cast is all iconic. They're by far, worst actors, then this new crew. However, I do miss, Bulk & Skull. Don't like the generic bullies in this movie. Still, the villains in this new movie was somewhat better. Don't get me wrong, Machiko Soga as Rita was fun to watch, but Elizabeth Banks as Rita was downright scary. She really did seem like a threat to be taken seriously. She was amazing. However, I can't say the same with Bill Hader & Bryan Cranston's performance. Hader's voice work for Alpha 5 seem kinda of jarring and out of place. At least, he wasn't as annoying as the original; while, Cranston seem limited to a few facial expression due to what the animator could animate in a few short months. It explains, why you rarely see his face, but hear his voice in the dark background. That's another problem with this film, it has way too many night sequences. Even with some light & amps up violence, the fake-looking fast-motion CGI action & wired work stunt long jumping looks terrible & sloppy. While, the 1990s 'The Power Rangers' is just as infamous with its very simplistic visual effects, with people in fake-looking rubber suits, cheap fireworks and recycle Japanese 'Super Sentai 'franchise stock footage. At least, it was bright and easy to see. Other problems, this movie has is the choppy editing and lack of exposition. Some scenes just don't go anywhere, or seem abandoned. A good example is how and why everybody got near the cave site in the middle of nowhere at the time. Also, it never really explained how they got from the second car crash of the movie to back to their own beds, since the Command Center does not seem to have teleportation capabilities. Also, the movie doesn't explain, why a ranger can only morph, when only they all can work as a team, but how Rita can still powerful even after betraying her team and built Goldar!? Nor does it explain how crashing multiply cars, and blowing up your locker, led to detention, and not seriously jail time as terrorism. However, the biggest complain, I got about this movie is the blatant produce placement of Kristy Kreme. It feature so much, it borderline into absurdity. There's a certain level of cheesiness, I'm willing to take, and a goal plot of getting to Kristy Kreme is not one of them. Overall: At the end of the day, the movie is just fun. It's a popcorn flick & that's all that matters. Maybe, not good enough to watch in theaters, but good enough to rent. Still, it made me, excited for a sequel!!! I enjoyed the hell out of it.",Power Rangers
20,Reno-Rangan,The power of Cadbury Gems!,4,13 October 2017,"It was one of those films known that it would fail even before being made. I've rated the rebooted 'Fantastic Four' better than this. I am not a 'Power Rangers' fan, but I was looking forward to it. Expected to be a decent, not this low. The major issue with the film was the story. What the heck! All the superhero films have this same platform. That's really boring. Even that's how the real 'Power Rangers' is, does not matter, it should have been re-wrote completely. Just like they had updated the costumes from cloths to metal armours.As usual, the actors are not to be blamed. Those young guys did good. Direction, not bad too. The graphic, nothing new or that impressive. If we observe closely all the CGI shot, they do not look fine, especially if you know all this stuff like an animator or something. The villain was weak. But the entire film was like just an introduction. They had held up everything till the last quarters to bring all together and make a massive stand off between the good and the bad.Maybe it could work for kids. Those who liked Marvel and DC superhero films would only find it a trash. The best thing about the film is, it is watchable, despite everything are familiar and predictable. I'm not in favour of a sequel, but surely they will make one. And that's result would decide the franchise's future, which I think has a slim chance against those superhero films that already bagged the large sum of fans to its pocket. As I said, the remaining one are children, who are upcoming generation. So if the filmmakers target them, even the adults would sit quiet and watch without whining.4/10",Power Rangers

I still liked it.Despite the Power Rangers looking like jaw breaker candies it was an entertaining flick. Children should like this one.It's the typical over done power ranger story but dark. Rita returns, wants revenge and Zordon and Alpha need teenagers with attitude. The kids are summoned and the struggle at first then by the end...the good guys win.I honestly was hoping for a sequel.

22,cruise01,Go Go Power Rangers!!! A lot of fun and great development.,8,25 March 2017,"A group of five troubled high school students discovering some power coins turning them into Power Rangers. I have never seen the original TV series and vaguely remember seeing the 1995 movie which was cool for its time but cheesy now and looking like a very low budget version of an nickelodeon movie. Dean Israelite film on this Power Rangers adaptation is a lot of fun seeing these students get together from their troubled past and form a team. The modern take is a blockbuster fun type of film that follows the cliché origin story and have a better looking armor suits with the rangers, some cheesy humor, and visual effects. Like most origin stories, the plot follows these five high school students who all cross paths in detention. Jason (Dacre Montgomery) a high school football player that got into a wreck after a prank gone bad. Billy (RJ Cyler) a smart awkward student in trouble for blowing up a locker. Kimberly (Naomi Scott) who got into trouble for punching the ex boyfriend. They all run into each other in the mountains, including Trini (Becky G) who is having trouble fitting in, and Zack (Ludi Lin) a teen that is arrogant but also has a soft side taking care of his sick mother in a trailer park. They all discover these alien coins that gives them superhuman strength and abilities. Making them Power Rangers. As a threat nears when Rita (Elizabeth Banks) is preparing to summon her army to unleash a weapon that can wipe everyone on Earth. Even though the film does follow the origin formula. It is a lot of fun seeing these five teens trying to coop on what has been holding them back and seeing them cooperate with the other. Even in the second act, when they are all at a campfire, sharing there troubled past. Also, seeing these five characters learning from Zordon (Bryan Cranston) who was once the leader of his team of power rangers. These characters learn what they have to become. You get to see these characters become the power rangers and morph into their armor a little late in the movie like the last half hour as they fight against Rita's army. It is great to see these characters develop in the movie, which is a lot of fun. The action sequence was fun. Seeing the power rangers operating their own Zords (robotic vehicles). And a battle with Goldar (a giant golden monster) and the Megazord that the rangers morphed into. The action picks up in the climax with destruction and fighting. The visual effects were nothing to brag about which was okay. The humor was cheesy when it came to dialogue or a plot device that centered it at a krispy kreme building. Even, seeing Rita waiting at the donut shop and eating a donut during the climax. Yet again, Power Rangers is supposed to be family fun. I love the cast talent that I would hope to see these actors grow further into their characters in sequels.Overall, Power Rangers is a lot of fun; it has character development, exciting action sequences, great cast, and cheesy humor, which you can expect, in this type of film. I would rate Power Rangers 4 out of 5 stars.",Power Rangers
23,zkonedog,Better Than It Probably Has Any Right To Be,7,25 March 2017,"""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers"" was the first television show I remember being totally mesmerized by. I was ""of the perfect age"" (8-10) when the show aired, and it was seemingly all- consuming in my life. So, when some 25 years later I heard that a new Power Rangers movie was hitting theaters, I knew I'd be front and center opening weekend (nostalgia is a powerful force). What I didn't know is if it would be any good, or if this remake would be butchered in any number of ways. Fortunately, ""Power Rangers"" was better than it really should have any right to have been.For a basic plot summary, ""Power Rangers"" tell the story of how a group of five ""teenagers with attitude""--Jason (Dacre Montgomery), Kimberly (Naomi Scott), Billy (RJ Cyler), Zack (Ludi Lin), & Trini (Becky G.)--find five mysterious colored coins hidden in a rock quarry. The coins give each of them superhuman abilities, and they soon discover that they are humanities only hope in fighting up with the forces of evil, more specifically Rita Repulsa (Elizabeth Banks) and her plot to destroy Angel Grove and the world with it. On the side of the five Rangers are Zordon (Bryan Cranston) the disembodied sage, and his robot sidekick Alpha 5 (Bill Hader).Here's the thing that I think everyone should keep in mind when analyzing this movie: In order for it to truly be ""Power Rangers"", it has to appeal to kids just as much as myself (the nostalgia- fueled audience). This film does an excellent job of doing both of those things. While I'm usually rather annoyed at kids chattering in the theater, I can make an exception for this film, as it was fun to hear the little ones' reactions to the entire experience. I have a strong feeling that if you watch this film as a 7-10 year old today, you'll leave thinking it is ""the best movie you've ever seen"". This was ESSENTIAL in the success of the film.There are also quite a few ""easter eggs"" (lines, visuals, cameos, etc.) for the ""old nostalgics"" like myself. While I may never be able to quite experience that sheer joy of being 8-10 again and watching in complete wonder, I was at least able to recapture some of that glory this time around. The film hews pretty true to the original ""Mighty Morphin"" storyline, just adding a few little wrinkles here and there. It's fun seeing the five teens both in and out of the suits, Cranston is a great Zordon, and Banks is quite entertaining as well. It is quite clear that Haim Saban and his production crew took great care to make sure this one stayed true to the spirit of the original.Only helping matters is director Dean Israelite, who really impressed me by helming ""Project Almanac"", another teen-driven vehicle that turned into a very entertaining flick. Building a movie around teens can be tricky (many pitfalls and tropes to avoid), but Israelite really seems to have a handle on that craft.Now, is ""Power Rangers"" a bit cheesy and predictable/straightforward. Sure. ""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers"" was the most cheesy and predictable show ever made! One has to just expect that going in. Even at the very top of its game, this material will never be given any major awards or anything like that. I think the thing that matters, though, is that this won't matter to kids at all, as they will be able to take the material completely at face value (much like I did at that age).Overall, then, I enjoyed the experience of re-living my youth and seeing ""Power Rangers"" up on the big screen once again! I saw the film with a younger sibling who knew little of the franchise, and she liked it just as much as me, so it really has to be doing something right in that regard. There is also almost unlimited potential for sequels spinning off from this effort, with something to that effect even teased in a post-credits scene. So, whether you are a 30-something looking to recapture a fleeting glimpse of youth or a kid being wowed by the Rangers for the first time, there will be something in this movie for you.",Power Rangers
24,TheMovieDiorama,Power Rangers is a superhero film aimed for younger audiences.,4,11 March 2018,"The attempted reboot of another franchise...that no one asked for. In a decade where Marvel rules the saturated superhero genre, there is no requirement for more especially when it's filled with mediocrity. Having no prior knowledge to the 'Power Rangers' franchise, this is a review strictly critiquing the film alone. Five students come across strange coins that lead to an underground spaceship eventually granting them the abilities of Power Rangers. They must learn to work together as a unit in order to prevent evil forces from destroying Earth. Now, let's whip out the old ""Superhero Check List"". Ready? Alright, here we go. Origin story (or stories) where the main character(s) must harness their new found ability? Check. Evil villain wanting to destroy the world for no apparent reason? Oh yes. A CGI disposable army? Yup, rock monsters this time! Leaving the story open for countless sequels? Naturally. There is not a single original idea, even when using such rich source material. It borrows elements from various other films and unfortunately does nothing inventive with them. Four bland protagonists and one who actually has some personality (the blue ranger, but you knew that anyway) lead a boring story filled with clichés and a formulaic structure. There's a moment where our characters sit down and say ""let's get to know each other"" as if the script forces character development right before your eyes. No natural progression, it's all artificial nonsense. I did like the design of the morphing suits and the advanced technology made for some inventive gadgetry. Although, for such an expensive film I'm surprised that the visual effects were frequently poorly executed. Obvious green screen was obvious. The constant use of slow motion was jarring, particularly during combat scenes. And then we get to the antagonist...ohhhh Elizabeth Banks. What are you doing here? A pantomime villain who's motives are not explored, just destroying the world because why not! What can I say except the film is unnecessary.",Power Rangers
25,matthewssilverhammer,"Wow, this actually wasn't that bad...",6,29 March 2017,"The very concept of ""Power Rangers"" is like straight from a child's playtime: kid-aged superheroes, funny robots, dino-vehicles, creepy aliens, rock ninjas, Kaiju-Transformer battles. This 21st century incarnation fulfills all these juvenile points, with hectic editing, clichéd dialogue, bad music & convenient predictability in nearly every story beat. Yet somehow, this unexpected remake is still silly-fun for middle-schoolers, with just the tiniest amount of narrative and character weight to engage adults, especially the nerdier ones. Like The Breakfast Club with karate, five misfit teenagers in detention stumble upon some ancient alien stones, which turn them into a team of superheroes who must fight an evil alien baddie named Rita (one of the most hilarious villain names ever). Other than Billy, the genius nerd with a Drax-like propensity for being too literal, the characters sort of get lost in the noise and color, written either too specific or too vague. However, the movie experience is largely pretty fun. In the style of movies like Chronicle and Raimi's Spider-Man, we watch these youth deal with their new powers with wide-eyed excitement. The action scenes are cartoonishly intense, the cinematography moves with surprising brains, and the climax is even a mild seat-clincher. Would this have worked better as a serialized TV show? Probably. The stuff in the bones of this universe is good, but its flesh is a bit flabby in this format. Still, as an old fan of this supremely stupid property, this is a nostalgic and sincere little fantasy outing. Go-go Power Rangers, indeed.",Power Rangers
26,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Character-driven ""Power Rangers"" can't find its own balance between meaningful and fun",5,28 June 2017,"First they came for the TV shows of kids who grew up in the '80s. It was only a matter of time before they came for my shows. As for how this big-screen adaptation fairs, color me indifferent.I was 6 years old when Saban's ""Power Rangers"" made its way to Fox Kids programming. The impression that this campy show – made by weaving footage of ""teenagers with attitude"" in Angel Grove with a Japanese ""Super Sentai"" show – left on me was indelible with its colors, imagination and structure. Yet the ""Power Rangers"" and their decades of iterations generated nostalgia for a wide array of Millennials, and the oldest subset (to which I belong) is definitely not the target demographic of the 2017 ""reboot.""""Power Rangers"" takes aim at a 13-22 demographic to be sure with a story that combines ""Transformers"" with ""The Breakfast Club."" A lot of attention is paid to story and rooting these five Rangers in reality. They are outcasts and renegades who have made mistakes. They seem to be attractive and cool on the outside but all experience some kind of pain, something that will surely resonate with teen audiences in a today's era of digital appearances versus reality.But what screenwriter John Gatins (""Real Steel"") and the two writing duos who worked on the story put into character development takes away from the entertainment value. The action of ""Power Rangers"" is delayed, scarce and no more remarkable than anything seen in the ""Transformers"" films, despite director Dean Israelite's solidly kinetic direction. All the attention to giving the story some heart ends up taking away from the entertainment value.In other words, in an effort to avoid the pitfalls of a ""Transformers"" film (all bots and no emotions), ""Power Rangers"" ends up being one of those classic, overdone origin stories. A huge chunk of the movie is dedicated to the Rangers becoming worthy enough to morph into their armor, a step we know they will take. The fact that they earn it doesn't necessarily make the payoff sweeter when any fan of the movies knows it wouldn't be a ""Power Rangers"" movie if the Rangers didn't morph, or get in their Dino-Zords, or become the Megazord.The seriousness with which the film attends to character development also leaves someone like Elizabeth Banks as the evil sorceress, Rita Repulsa, out to dry. She's the only character who maintains the campy tone of the TV series, meaning that as funny as Banks can be, she stands out in a painfully awkward way when she's the only one making corny remarks – the humor among the Rangers is more modern campy (like when R.J. Cyler's Billy says ""Come at me, bro."")Camp doesn't play well in modern blockbusters, but historically it's an essential energy of the ""Power Rangers"" franchise. The movie does not embrace it, but neither can it avoid it – the whole series is about someone who just wants to take over the world and keeps making monsters to attack the same city, a plan that every time is thwarted by a group of teenagers. In approaching the material this way – focusing on character to make the ""Power Rangers"" content more meaningful yet not figuring out a way to make it equally more fun – the film straddles two incompatible tones. The film works toward and understands the value of both tones, but they only inhibit or contradict each other.On the positive side, the art direction brings the previously spandex-and-plastic-clad Power Rangers to life in a visually compelling way and the stars – Dacre Montgomery, Naomi Scott, RJ Cyler, Ludi Lin and Becky G – make the script's character work feel worth it.""Power Rangers"" is certainly not terrible, but struggles to be unique in a highly competitive blockbuster landscape. The elements of the film all feel borrowed from other superhero or teens with powers movies and not quite enough of the show's spirit makes the cut to give ample props for the nostalgia factor. Far from an embarrassment, but far from a success.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more",Power Rangers
27,subxerogravity,Impressive. Not bad at all.,7,23 March 2017,"Another installment in nostalgia.When I first heard about the Power Rangers being brought back as a film franchise I was pretty jazzed about it. It does not hurt that the closest thing to bad press I heard about the movie was that they needed to push back the filming, which only allowed them to add the star power of Bryan Cranston and Elisabeth banks.Only indifference I had towards the movie was that as corny as the TV show was the concept of a group of overachieving teenagers being selected to become the best of the best makes sense (Especially because they are teenagers, they should be the best of the best at lease). Because dark is cool these days, the Rangers needed to have more edge to them, which is why this new team is made of ""diamonds in the rough"" who society has scrub off as screw-ups. So the idea is that Bryan Cranston who plays the big giant head Zordon, has the power coins pick those who have the potential to be the best of the best.Out of all the superhero movies that are coming out, Power Rangers is not the best of the best, it's definitely a diamond in the rough that has potential, but still needs more training. I did like the cast of teenagers who had some very distinctive personalities, as they try to even out the characters. I did love the fact that the Blue Ranger was played by a black dude, and The Black Ranger was played by an Asian dude (it's less distracting than what happen in the TV show).Bryan Cranston's star power did nothing to make his Zordon a better giant head, but Elisabeth Banks was great as Rita Repulsa. In a time with Superhero movies having weak antagonist, I got to say, I enjoyed what Banks did with the character and loved to see her on the screen.So I went into this really wanting to see this and I was not disappointed. It's not really what I expected as it's not the kung fu spectacular the TV show was, but it is a good movie. Not great just good.http://cinemagardens.com",Power Rangers

The characters play there parts well and put there own spin on it. Plays like The Breakfast Club with superpowers,puts a little realism in there performances.

29,stevendbeard,Go Go Power Rangers!,7,24 March 2017,"I saw ""Power Rangers"", starring Dacre Montgomery-Stranger Things_tv, Safe Neighborhood; Naomi Scott-Inspector Lewis_tv, The 33; Elizabeth Banks-The Hunger Games movies, Slither; Bryan Cranston-The Infiltrator, Rock of Ages and the voice of Bill Hader-Popstar:Never Stop Never Stopping, Men in Black 3.This is the 3rd Power Rangers theatrical movie-the first was 1995's Mighty Morphin Power Rangers & the second was 1997's Turbo:A Power Rangers Movie-but this is actually a reboot and not really connected to the previous movies or TV shows. It has better effects-Duh!-and a couple of cameos of previous Rangers-Jason David Frank & Amy Jo Johnson-so keep an eye out during a crowd scene in Angel Grove. They are easy to spot, the camera stays on them for a bit. This movie starts with an alien team of Power Rangers, led by Bryan/Zordon, that are fighting Elizabeth/Rita Repulsa during the dinosaur age of the Earth. After the results of that battle, flash to the present, where teenagers Dacre, Naomi and three others find 5 power coins which lead them to a buried space ship. Bill voices a robot called Alpha 5, who is on board and introduces them to Bryan, who is now part of the ship and communicates as a disembodied head. The teens are informed that they have been chosen to become the new Power Rangers, super heroes that protect the Earth, and the training begins. Otherwise, the usual aspects of the Power Ranger universe are here; lots of martial arts fighting, rock-like creatures as henchmen, giant titans in battle, Zords and they do use the Power Rangers theme song-Go Go Power Rangers! As the end credits start, there is a quick scene having something to do with Tommy Oliver but there is nothing at the very end of the movie. FYI: In case you are one of those ignorant people that wanted to boycott Beauty & the Beast-for some kind of gay issues-then you might want to steer clear from this movie, too. Otherwise, you might just meet the first homosexual Power Ranger. It's rated ""PG-13"" for sci-fi violence, action and destruction, language and some crude humor and has a running time of 2 hours & 4 minutes.

30,alindsay-al,An above average more mature reboot,6,27 March 2017,"As a fan of the old TV series and the outrageously bad movie I had some excitement for this movie even though I was a little worried, but this was a pretty fun movie but with some flaws. The premise of this film sees a group of unconventional teenagers have to come together to form the power rangers. Dacre Montgomery who is new to me plays Jason /the red ranger in this film and I thought he did a really good job. He seemed like a real person that makes mistakes and I did care about him as a character even when he wasn't the red ranger which was important. To be honest I thought all the rangers had really good chemistry together and were all pretty likable, special shoutout has to go to RJ cyler who plays Billy/the blue ranger and he is easily the best character in this film, with the funniest moments and easily the most likability. Bryan Cranston plays zordon in this film and he does a good job as the tough leader of the rangers and his development throughout the film does work. However, there are a few characters in this film that come across as they are in a different film which I will mention about other aspects of the film. Bill hader as Alpha 5 and especially Elizabeth banks as Rita repulsa stand out like a sore thumb because they are imitating the cheesiness of the TV show an former movie which this film hasn't. The film is pretty real but both of these characters are ridiculously over the top and really takes you out of the pretty decent movie you are watching. The story of the film takes a different look at these kids and I liked seeing there characters develop together as people and as a team. But this film has a severe lack of stakes as it seems only a small village is in peril in the final conflict of the film, also Rita's motivations are so paper thin that it is laughable at times. The script has some real well done humour that makes you connect to the rangers, but it also has some really cringe worthy humour and one liners especially from Rita. The dramatic dialogue does mostly work in the film as well. The style of the first half of the film doesn't feel particularly like the power rangers but I found it really interesting watching these characters develop and train to become the power rangers. Then the last act of the film happens and it feels like an episode from the old TV show with all the power rangers things. The sudden shift of tones comes out of nowhere and it really feels like you are watching a different cheesy movie and it really hurt the film. Overall this film is better then I thought it would be and I think it could be worth a watch if you like the power rangers, if there is a sequel though I hope it can be better.",Power Rangers

33,rgkarim,"""Go-Go"" Special Effects... and some Comedy.",7,24 March 2017,"In the 90's Saban unleashed onto our homes five teenage heroes dress in multicolored, state of the art underwear. What followed was legacy of aspiring actors fighting men in ashen grey costumes, before turning their attention to unique costumed antagonists that tried to stop their quest. And to this day Power Rangers continues to be a hit amidst the adolescent world as Nickelodeon continues to inspire them to fight as the rainbow warriors. So of course, we needed a movie to really seal the deal, based on the original series that started it all. Robbie K here to cover another movie. Let's get started. Summary: If you were a fan of the series like I was, then you will certainly be looking for that nostalgic adventure you had as a kid. Well the movie is able to bring some of that back as traditional characters (in new, hot, youthful skins) return to fight the forces of evil. But past the new cast, you'll be go go going crazy for all the throwbacks including: Zords, monsters, Rita's dramatic speeches, cameos, and of course the suits. It's fun to relive those childhood moments, making one laugh at all the memories that come rushing back in this new adventure. But if nostalgia won't make you smile, then certainly the comedy of the movie will be an entertaining factor. Power Rangers surprisingly is funny (and not in the cheesy way the classic series was). Each of the teens has their moments where they put their foot in their mouth or get a taste of humility as they eat pavement. But it is Billy who steals the show, as the autistic youth delivers well-timed comedy that grounds all the drama brought by this new generation of rangers. Yes, you heard me drama, this origin movie has far more drama than the series had back then and with it some surprising character depth. Where the 90's was cutesy love and bullying, this movie goes deeper down the teenage angst path. It works at times and helps expand on what once was limited roles. As for the action, Power Rangers is also decent in this category as well. This film has some fast-paced karate chopping action, that quickly melds into robot on monster smashing. The special effects are semi impressive, not so much in terms of realism, but capturing the spunk of Power Rangers. The Zords in particular are much smoother, and the modern twist on their design matches the edgier theme of the movie. And of course, there are lots of thrilling explosions and sound effects to bring it all to the front. While not as cheesy as Saban's classic fights, the battles in this film still have that energy we all fell in love with. Summary: Despite the deeper lore of the series, the teenage issues were also a little eye rolling as well. I know not to expect a masterpiece, but this Power Ranger plot felt like an after school special meeting a special effects show. I'm sure this will speak to many of the modern generation, but these issues just felt out of place compared to those in the 90s. Plus, the rebellious, delinquent protagonists aren't necessarily the ideal role models for the younger generations. Perhaps it was also the darker atmosphere that also detracted it from me. Despite added suspense and danger, the darker moments made the movie less fun for me at times. And to be honest, some of the darker moments were a bit disturbing at times, so please exercise caution if your kids are easily scared. Speaking of scary, the new direction they took with Rita Repulsa was not the most comforting thing to see. This portrayal was much more nightmarish, replacing Rita's grandiosity with pure insanity and lust as she feasted on ""gold"" from every source. While the edginess wins points for danger, the creepy (somewhat adulterated) portrayal of Rita did not impress me, nor did the overacting (again dramatic) walks/speeches she made through the movie. In addition, I wasn't a fan of the new Goldar, wondering why they replaced the cheesy (yet creative) chimera design for a CGigoldenVelveeta monster? Yes, the monsters certainly lacked that design we all loved, for again darker, edgier forms. In regards to the action, well as always, I wanted more. Power Rangers runs just a little over two hours, but only about twenty minutes of that is actually action. It would have been nice to have a little more investment in the combat scenes to really deliver the promised punch the first 90 minutes promised. For one thing, it would have been nice for all the weapons, not just a random appearing sword, to make an appearance as they fought for the sake of the world. That minor detail aside, the kung Fu scenes could have been longer, and the Zords could have had a little more coordination than just one or two taking a punch. In addition, the edgier Rita needed some more time to show off her skills (other than speeches and walking through CGI streets). The Verdict:Power Rangers is certainly a fun stroll down memory lane, filled with plenty of nostalgic references to make you feel sort of like a kid again. With a new edge comes character development and special effects that for the most part work. Yet, there are still some balance issues that need work, including stepping back from the darkness and increase the emphasis on action (and story). Still not a bad origins story. Worth a trip to the theater? For the special effects and adventure, definitely, but there are other movies better worth the price of admission.

34,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,Not a bad start for long theater absence,6,4 July 2017,"In the early 1990s, the Power Rangers TV show was a big thing when it came out. With its big action set pieces and varying evil characters to combat, many kids found the show to be a lot of fun growing up. Since then the show has continued to be superseded by different kinds of rangers. The style and execution of the show very much remained the same but the difference was in the designs and settings. Every few years seemed like a new version of the Power Rangers were being made. Prior to that, two movies were made featuring the original rangers. Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers: The Movie (1995) and Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie both attempted to bring about more fans but only succeeded with the first. The show was what really kept the franchise afloat. Being that it's so popular though, producers finally thought it was time to reboot the series with a brand new film. Modernization of the characters, suits, and villains were something that was bound to happen. In the end, it was alright.Seeing that this is a reboot film, the script was handled as an origin story. Written by John Gatins, audiences are introduced to a bunch of misfits that can't seem to find a break in their lives. Jason (Dacre Montgomery) is a football player who just blew is last shot at getting a scholarship for a dumb prank he tried to pull. Kim (Naomi Scott) was once a cheerleader who made an ill-fated social media post that got her in trouble. Billy (RJ Cyler) is just a book worm techie and gets caught in the wrong situations. Zack (Ludi Lin) and Trini (Becky G.) are both outsiders who try to stay as secluded as possible from the town they live in. Before they know it, they cross paths together after discovering mystical colored coins. Upon making this discovery, they then run into Alpha 5 (Bill Hader) and Zordon (Bryan Cranston), the original owners of the glowing coins. There they learn what the power rangers were all about and that an ex ranger by the name Rita Repulsa (Elizabeth Banks) must be stopped before she destroys their world.The development of the main leads are adequate. Although they make questionable decisions at first, viewers can get attached to them. The actors portraying those characters do an acceptable job. With the cast only having big name actors as the supporting roles, this gives ample time for the lesser-known thespians to shine. Out of that group, nobody takes the spotlight more than the other. They all have their moments to grow and that's always a sign the writer is thinking properly. What doesn't make sense though is that once these individuals start to train as power rangers, everyone in school treats them exactly the opposite. That's not realistically believable. On top of that Billy is a wiz at almost everything and even discovers an important plot device that Repulsa is looking for. How he finds is not explained and makes no sense. Putting that aside though, the rest of the storytelling is decent. Gatins was also the writer to Real Steel (2011), Need for Speed (2014) and Kong: Skull Island (2017).The direction was also competently controlled by Dean Israelite. What's more surprising is that Israelite had only directed one other theatrical feature which had a much smaller budget and only made twice as much back. The film was Project Almanac (2015), which was released in late January. When movies are released then, most are because they are not very good films. But all the power to Israelite for moving up. The action sequences that begin to occur around the middle of the film are well staged. Any CGI that was used in those scenes were also rendered effectively not to look fake. One of the more unique designs was to Repulsa's Goldar. Made completely of molten liquid gold, the flow of how the liquid gold moves is not seen on many creatures. The power ranger suits was another change that was done in order to not date the costume. This worked in their favor because although it's metallic armor, it looks much more durable than to that of the older style suits. Like they actually could take a beating.Camera-work for this film was a mixed bag however. Shot by Matthew J. Lloyd, the cinematography is a hybrid of shaky cam, rotating panoramic shots and traditional shooting. The classical filmmaking parts were fine; nothing to mention there. The shaky cam and rotating shots are another problem. Shaky cam is always an issue because the motions can be nauseating even if the idea is to create realism. As for the rotating shots, it can get very dizzying. Lloyd got some professional shots but anything else is nothing to be impressed with. He also filmed for Cop Car (2015) and Project Almanac (2015). Rounding out the technical elements was music composed by Brian Tyler. In the past, Tyler's music has been used for many different action films and here it sounds very stock in its own way. For some reason he doesn't translate the Power Rangers main theme but it's not all neglected. Tyler seems to have taken an alternate approach to his music. In certain areas, cues will sound close Daft Punk's sound. Interesting.Modernizing the power rangers franchise wasn't a bad idea at all. Much of the work put into this feature manages to stand out with relatively necessary development of characters. The action is permissible and the music fits the genre to a degree. The only problem is the script misses some key points and the cinematography is uneven in presentation.",Power Rangers
35,justin-fencsak,This movie is so underrated...,8,29 July 2017,"When Power Rangers first came out on TV in the early 90s, no one never knew that it was an Americanized version of the Super Sentai Japanese TV shows from the 70s and 80s. Saban took footage from the series, dubbed it, and blended it in with American scenes to make a TV shows that became an icon of afternoon children's TV and spawned two movies, video games, and merchandise, not to mention controversy from politicans who thought the show was too violent. The 2017 version of this movie, coming out a few years after a Youtuber made a darker take on the show in a short film, is a perfect reboot in an age of bad reboots this decade. The casting is great, and the main villain is more sexier than the last time she was on TV. The visual effects are amazing, the soundtrack great, and the pacing of the movie is pretty good. There's also a John Hughes-esque feel in this movie, kinda similar to Spider-Man Homecoming, and there's a bonus scene after the main credits that sets up a possible sequel, which based on home media sales and rentals, might happen if Lionsgate has the money to make it.",Power Rangers
36,bkrauser-81-311064,Nostalgia Feigning Sincerity,6,24 March 2017,"Guess its time to whip out your old Tamagotchi and listen to whatever Marcy Playground song you've recorded on your Tiger Talkboy when you were six; because the nineties are back! Don't believe me, just check out the newest blockbuster film that's about to hit your multiplex with the force of a speeding Bronco. Yes the Mighty Morphing Power Rangers are back and this time instead of importing stock footage from some cheap Japanese superhero show, this brooding, edgier version is importing clichés from every American superhero film from the last fifteen years.Just how much edgier is this new movie? Well the story begins with three of the five soon-to-be Rangers spending their Saturdays in detention so already they're more irascible than Bulk and Skull. They're also about half as much fun as evidenced after our five teenagers with attitude meet up, discover their multi-colored power coins and proceed to stare at each other in confusion. This lasts an entire act and throughout we're only given the archetypal outlines of our heroes to play with. There's the bland Red leader (Montgomery), the Yellow outsider (G.), the Black bad boy (Lin) and the Pink Ranger (Scott) who seems to think cutting her hair on a whim doesn't make her the personification of mayonnaise.Then of course there's Billy (Cyler), the Blue Ranger. He's on the spectrum; you can tell because he outright says he's ""on the spectrum."" While this could have been a good moment to truly act upon the TV show's (1993-1995) phoned-in anti-bully, inclusion-based ""the more you know,"" pablum, the movie basically just uses him as a narrative building block. That's of course when they're not also using the Blue Ranger as a tonally embarrassing point of mirth for the sake of undermining the gritty tone. Considering that his autism is boiled down to a running joke, its a miracle RJ Cyler comes across as sincere as he does. Every time the ensemble tries to elevate him as the movie's heartfelt center, you really want to believe it's sincerity, even if it feels counterfeit.Its that faux sincerity and the nostalgia that will no doubt sell long-time fans on this new film. As much as the reboot wobbles between seriousness and silliness, the fact that there is an appearance of a center of mass, means that there's just enough here for audiences to trick themselves into thinking they saw the best version they possibly could have made. It makes a kind of sense; how can you really make a realistic movie about children gaining superpowers through alien technology to fight evil? While I don't agree with the premise of the question (I mean, does it really need to be realistic?), I also don't think the answer is to wait until the very end to introduce the franchises sillier minutia. Especially when the directing and editing would make anyone with eyeballs want to spin them back into their head. It's not Fantastic Four (2014)-level bad, but the fact that I'm bringing up that film in the same breath as this one, is evidence their both are in the same ball park and both need to answer for the millions of dollars wasted. I mean come on, the best part about this mess is the slovenly fight choreography which could have been done with a couple of costumes and a million yen.It's hard to say Power Rangers (sponsored by Krispy Kreme) is the latest victim in franchise co-oping by greedy executives, short-sighted PR experts and story-arcs by committee. While Spider-Man fans and Batman fans could argue their IP's came from some nebulous notion of artistry over commerce, Power Rangers has been a cheaply cobbled cash grab pretty much from inception. In that regard the fact that this film has any semblance of sincerity is a minor miracle. If you got to see it, focus on that and that alone. Go, go mediocrity.",Power Rangers

38,quincytheodore,"Discount Breakfast Club got superpowers, presented by Krispy Kreme",6,22 March 2017,"Join five teenagers as they embark on overly complex origin story, staggering change in directional tone, intense product placement and awkward usage of nostalgia. The hectic mess is not without its charm, the team is, at the very least, likable with more personality than transforming robot movies in recent time had, though it's not a high achievement. The best thing one could say about this reboot is it could've been so much worse.Origin story isn't the most novel idea, but it has become a necessity as of late, especially for a reboot. The Rangers undergo a series of exposition, mainly taking serious direction from other superhero themed movie Chronicle, but also translating the corny style from its original television show. It tells both the story of apocalypse and also abundance of jokes, and then it veers into the realm of heavy personal issues.The sudden shift is felt so many times that the movie feels like a robot piloted by several people. However, it's not without charm or humor. The cast might feel bizarrely put together at fight, but they do have their moments. This provides a little bit of bravado and less vanilla than the original show. If anything, they are limited only by the fantasy troupes which may seem predictable or campy, then again this is Power Rangers, not Logan.It has one edge over other superhero movies; the product placement. The trend has been done for years, but Power Rangers take it to the next level. For action, humanoid and robotic, it mostly stays true to the original source, including poses and jingles. This does feel like an afternoon show with the ad and spark of nostalgia.Many have complained that superhero movies are too gritty or too corny, Power Rangers is both, often at the same time. This is clearly not an advantage as it would have fared much better sticking to the light humor or heavy personal struggle. Still, for a movie based on 90s children show, it offers mild indulgent and barely avoids being a total disaster.",Power Rangers
39,arungeorge13,A film about cheesy high-schoolers for cheesy high-schoolers! [+36%],4,28 June 2017,"The new 'Power Rangers' film has the look and feel of a mixed bag. It tries to cram too much into an origin story which is characterized by unlikable high-schoolers who happen to meet at detention. There is absolutely zero chemistry amongst the Rangers just as Jason the Red Ranger keeps blurting all through the first three quarters of the film. The dialogues are the textbook definition of 'cheesy', while the characters themselves believe they're wise-cracking. Not a good sign if you ask me. PG-13 rating ensures negligible usage of cuss words and gore-free CGI violence. The last act appears like a Transformers rip-off. Ugly-looking stone monsters fighting it out with bots in the town centre in a badly-choreographed setpiece with some absolutely outrageous twists thrown in. Of course, I don't mean to underestimate the current generation of teens but this flick simply caters to a really small audience. None of the characters (barring maybe Billy's) even manage to evoke the slightest bit of interest (or amusement!). A short scene where they all sit down around a fire detailing some of their personal secrets was in fact one of the few redeeming factors. There needed to be plenty more Easter eggs than just the famous Power Rangers theme being played during the climax set-piece. The CGI itself looks lacklustre for a 100 million $ venture. The narrative is so jumbled and the tone literally all over the place for this film to be treated as a solid 'Power Rangers' reboot. Elizabeth Banks (under a truckload of make-up) looks bizarre and seems miscast for the character of Rita Repulsa, whose costumes appear to be unintentionally hilarious.The writing goes haywire from the moment the group discovers the spaceship and encounters Zordon, the previous Red Ranger. More light should have been shed on individual character weaknesses before moving on to bigger things like preparing to become 'Rangers' all of a sudden (just because some entity in a spaceship tells them that they're designated world-protectors!). The training scenes are a mess. Performances aren't exactly stuff to write home about. This film positions itself as harmless popcorn fun and nothing more. Sigh!",Power Rangers
40,Screen_Blitz,"Hungry for some fast, kinetic teen superhero action? This visually enthralling actioner surprisingly delivers some goods",6,28 June 2017,"Who would have expected for Saban's cheesy, yet popular television franchises to spear their way back on the silver screen? Unless you were a child growing in the 90s or early-to-mid 2000s as the fan of the one of the TV shows, chances are you were expecting the team of teenagers confined into their robotic suits to decimate into obscurity. Against those odds, Dean Israelite, the director behind the mediocre found-footage thriller 'Project Almanac', becomes the operator of the first Power Rangers film to hit the theaters since the abysmal sequel titled 'Power Rangers Turbo' two decades ago. In a shocking conclusion, this teen superhero boasts a surprising amount of competence compared to the overwhelming goofiness that defined the original source material. Tearing away from the television shows' campy style in favor of a slightly gritter approach, Israelite somewhat proves that you can uproot more competence out of a source material that is highly unknown for harvesting a lick of intelligence. That is not to say that his execution kicks off on a clunky start. This film follows a group of high school strangers: mischievous Jason (played by Dacre Montgomery), former cheerleader Kimberly (played by Naomi Scott), smart, but bullied loner Billy (played by (RJ Cyler), a social outcast Trini (played by Becky G), and a lonely Asian Zack (played by Ludi Linn). Upon coming across a mysterious alien ship underground, these teens acquire uncanny superpowers and are enlisted by a computerized-being named Zordon (voiced by Bryan Cranston) and his robotic dwarf Alpha-5 (voiced by Bill Hader) to save the world against an evil queen named Rita Repulsa (played by Elizabeth Banks). By far the easiest and arguably most predictable achievement this film acquires from Dean Israelite's direction is generating immense nostalgia for fans of the television series. The most notable element would be splicing in the theme song at the height of the climatic battle sequence. Israelite's directorial efforts on bringing the popular source material to life however, finds no escape from the flaws that riddle the final product. Rather than introducing the character as veterans of the titular superhero squad, the movie boasts an origin story follows the genesis of the teens acquiring their powers. Spending the first half establishing each of the teen's backgrounds, one of which involves the Asian kid coping the sickness of his mother, another involving a teen girl questioning her sexuality upon meeting these new others. That is right! the superhero genre has just gave birth to their first LGBT superhero. Anyway, the film does show a muscle with character development rather settling generic high school stereotypes. But what about the fun? The main problematic aspect here is the struggle to bring back the campy, if cheesy fun that made the original television franchises entertaining. Whether it is from sore lack of superhero action up until the final twenty minutes or the clunky tonal shifts, the excitement of the titular heroes fight to save the world feels shallow. The climatic battle sequence at the end is somewhat fun and visually appealing, but is nothing impressive. The performances from the cast are mostly solid, though Elizabeth Banks's hammy portrayal as the villain Rita Repulsa feels somewhat out of place. There's a few well landed attempts at humor along dozens of laughable one-liners dealing with Krispy Kreme. What is up? Was the director trying to disguise this movie into a two-hour commercial for a donut shop. Maybe not, but it almost feels like it.Power Rangers is surprisingly proficient adaptation of the source material of the same name with some goods to offer, but perhaps not much so for those unconverted to the Power Ranger fandom. Above all, it is more than likely the nostalgia of the popular television shows will triumph over the writing and direction. Entertained or not, there is a hint of a sequel lurking upon the horizon.",Power Rangers
41,Troy_Campbell,A dull cinematic episode that does little to quicken the pulse.,4,24 March 2017,"After sitting through this overlong cinematic adventure for the titular band of colourful warriors, it's not completely clear if this was made for the 30-somethings who grew up with the cheesy show or the current generation of pre-teens. Similar in tone and presentation to Michael Bay's Transformers franchise, this big screen adaptation has a healthy dose of teenage angst (and awkwardness), whirling camera-work and rapid-fire editing, suggesting the new crop of kids are the target audience. On the other hand there's a tongue-in-cheek campiness that is clearly meant to tug on the nostalgia strings; the goofily choreographed fights, the insanely hammy villain and the on-the-nose metaphors are all handed over from show to movie. It's hard to see how either demographic is going to walk away wholly satisfied though. A bloated runtime and a lack of action will surely lead to boredom for the young'uns, and the ludicrously long wait to actually see the Power Rangers in full getup could annoy the fans from way back. Waiting until approximately 90 minutes in before the new batch of heroes even suit up, the climax is a CGI flurry of underwhelming baddies, nonsensical action beats and plot contrivances so outlandish they make Vin Diesel films seem as clever as Inception. There's no doubting the noble intentions of this modern update, and Elizabeth Banks is a blast as Rita Repulsa, however this incarnation of Power Rangers fails to quicken the pulse.",Power Rangers
42,Pumpkin_Man,An Underwhelming Reboot to my Childhood Show!!!,8,27 March 2017,"Just warning you, this review will contain spoilers, mostly about the things I didn't like and how it compares to the show. You have been warned! As a child of the 90's, Mighty Morphin Power Rangers was one of my favorite shows. That was my jam. I had a lot of the toys, and my mom took me to see the original Power Rangers movie with Ivan Ooze when it was released at the theater way back in 1995. 20 years later, along comes a newer rebooted darker PG-13 Power Rangers movie. I was kinda excited, but wasn't liking the look of Rita Repulsa or Goldar from the trailers. Now, after seeing the movie, I still have very mixed feelings about it. I didn't like that they didn't start out as friends. In the show, they were already best friends. Here, they are social outcasts who try to get along with each other. There was no Bulk and Skull, no Ernie, no Youth Center/Juice Bar, I still don't like the look of Goldar. They only played the ""Go go Power Rangers"" theme song for a couple of seconds when they got into their Zords. I could probably go on a little longer, but I'll mention just two more things; they couldn't even morph til the last 20 minutes of the movie, and Zordon was very critical of them. In the series, he already had confidence in them. I understand this is a reboot and it's starting over, but as a nostalgic kid of the 90's, I couldn't help but compare it to the show.Jason is a football all-star, but throws it away when he pulls a prank and gets involved in a police chase. He's put in detention where he meets Billy and Kimberly. Billy takes Jason out to a quarry where they find 5 colorful crystals. (Kimberly, Zack and Trini just so happened to be out there too) The crystals give them superhuman strength and powers (This contradicts the series because they only had their powers when they morphed into their armor, but oh well) They go back to the quarry, and stumble upon a giant spaceship where Zordon and Alpha 5 have lived for the last 65 million years. Meanwhile, a fishing boat stumbles upon Rita Repulsa's body in the sea. They bring her onboard and she begins to resurrect herself. Rita needs lots of gold to bring Goldar to life to help her find the Zeo crystal. Throughout the film, the gang trains and tries to morph. When they finally do morph, it's pretty cool, but the fighting and action scenes were quite underwhelming. I even remember thinking to myself ""That's it?"" Elizabeth Banks did a fairly good job as Rita. She even says ""Make my monster grow!"" I didn't hate the movie, I just think it could've been done better. I'll definitely buy it when it comes out to Blu-Ray. I'll say that this film will really make you appreciate the TV series and the '95 film with Ivan Ooze better.

45,rockman182,Power Rangers (2017),6,13 June 2017,"I still remember watching Fox Five as a kid and for the first time seeing the series premiere of The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. I was amazed as a five year old seeing this show and instantly got hooked. The first Power Rangers movie was a film that definitely defined my childhood. It was instantly quotable and campy fun. When I heard about this film I had zero hopes. I haven't kept up with the show beyond the first two or three seasons as a kid and expected a reboot for the film and franchise to be a failing venture. I was actually surprised that this film was actually entertaining. There were many problems with it but I think the origin story was done quite well.The film follows five teenagers who band together one night and discover mysterious power coins at an old mining site. They soon discover these coins are responsible for giving them superhero powers. They soon discover an ancient alien spaceship where they are grouped by Zordon to become the Power Rangers and stop an ancient Green Ranger who turned rogue named Rita Repulsa. Rita is trying destroy the planet and is in search for a crystal that will do so. She's also harboring the towns gold to create a giant gold monster named Goldar.First off, the film took some liberties with the characters. Rita is now a former ranger who lost their way and Goldar is a gigantic and destructive creature (rather than the buffoon follower of Rita in the series). We also learn much about Zordon's origins. The rangers also are more socially updated. One of the rangers is diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder, and another ranger is a lesbian. They also shifted things around (finally changed the Black Ranger being Black!) None of this was problematic and was actually fairly entertaining.The film does suffer from too much inactivity where the characters try to bond together and find themselves to morph into their armored ranger selves. The main battle also is a bit disappointing as I felt it was a little too anti-climactic. Still, This exceeded my very low expectations.

47,Benjamin-M-Weilert,A surprisingly well-done nostalgic reboot,8,8 March 2019,"In one of the many gritty reboots of a nostalgic 1990's franchise, I didn't have much expectation for Power Rangers (2017). The original show was pretty campy, with a tried-and-true plot structure that didn't change much from episode to episode. In fact, I probably couldn't tell you the specific plot of any of the episodes. They'd usually follow this format: the main villain would go about trying to obtain some goal via their minions/henchmen, the Power Rangers would morph and fight the minions/henchmen, the minions/henchmen would grow large and start destroying everything, the Power Rangers would call their Zords out to battle, and (finally) the Zords would combine into the Megazord and the foe would be vanquished.While Power Rangers did follow some of the structure of the television show format, it also managed to create characters with some depth and background to them. From a disgraced football star to an autistic teen who doesn't get jokes to a cyber-bully cheerleader to a (possibly) bisexual loner to a reckless mother's boy, the five teenagers certainly have their share of angst and diversity. I do give kudos to the scriptwriters for including characters that feel distinctly modern without being too preachy about it.And yet, while Power Rangers has a lot going for it, including plenty of action and a modicum of nostalgia, there are still a few flaws. Some of the humor is a bit juvenile, especially for a PG-13 film. I also couldn't help but recognize the quite familiar setup of The Breakfast Club (1985), even to the point where I wanted the film to end with the Red Ranger holding a defiant fist in the air while ""Don't You (Forget About Me)"" plays in the background. Was this supposed to be a reboot of The Breakfast Club instead of Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers?A surprisingly well-done nostalgic reboot, I give Power Rangers 4.0 stars out of 5.",Power Rangers
48,RforFilm,"Go go Power Rangers? For those wanting some good acting and well transferred material from the show, I'd say yes",7,24 March 2017,"Anyone (not just kids) will tell you that part of the 1990s couldn't be understood without looking at one of the biggest phenomenons that debuted at the time, the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. I'm aware that the show is still on TV, though it's been a long time since I watched it. As a kid of the 90s, I can say that I liked watching it and even held a Power Rangers birthday party when I was in the second grade. Unlike Disney or the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, the Power Rangers were something of a fad that I kept in my heart for about three years before I moved on.For those that don't know, Mighty Morphin Power Rangers came from Japanese show called Super Sentai. While all the scenes featuring the rangers fighting monsters, puttys and Rita Repulsa came from Japan ala stock footage, the American footage was new and featured new teenagers becoming the rangers to stop evil. I gave the show another watch recently and discovered that it was way cheesier then I remembered. However, there is a fascination with just how cheesy it was and I had fun exploring it. Like a lot of recent super hero movies, our teenage heroes get their turn for a gritty reboot in Power Rangers. In the Northern California town of Angel Grove, young Jason Scott (played by Dacre Montgomery) ruins his football career after a prank gets him arrested. While in detention, he ends up befriending autistic Billy Cranston (played by RJ Miller) and popular girl Kimberly Hart (played by Naomi Scott). The three end up at a rock quarry where Billy is working on uncovering a mysterious object while the too-cool-for-school punk Zack (played by Ludi Lin) and quiet loner Trini (played by Becky G) happen to be at the same time. The objects are rock-like coins that change their lives forever. All five teenagers wake up the next morning to see that their stronger and more resistant to pain. They agree to go back to the site to look for answers. There they find a space ship that has been hidden for millions of years. Awaiting them is Zodon (played by Brian Cranston), a former ranger who seems to be a part of the ships power grid, and Alpha 5 (played by Bill Hader). The kids are told that the coins chose them to become the new rangers. They have to adapt to their new powers soon to stop the recently awoken witch Ritia Repulsa (played by Elizabeth Banks).I have to give Power Rangers a lot of credit for attempting to take a lot of the ridiculous concepts for the show and trying to make them more grounded. The results are mixed, even though overall I had fun. The best thing about this movie was something that the show lacked; the chemistry and emotion from the five teenagers. Not only are all five good actors, but the movie takes a lot of time getting to know them and just how they came to form their team.Even Brian Cranston and Bill Hader do well in adapting their characters to the big screen. One of the weaker performances is Elizabeth Banks. While everyone seems to be playing their parts seriously, she made her character very campy. While she can be fun to watch, it can come off as inconsistent.Speaking of which, the overall tone seems to mix fine until the end. You'll be surprised to learn that out heroes don't morph until way later. Once they do, the movie seems to have trouble sticking to it's gritty origin, especially when the zords start to fight the larger monsters. It's not as impressive as Pacific Rim, but it's better shot then the remake of Godzilla. I'd say the movie is stronger when the characters don't morph.I'll give this seven red ranger helmets out of ten. I'm surprised how much care went into the scriptbefore the characters become the Power Rangers. It seems that the movies really wants to emulate The Breakfast Club more then it does the TV show is based off of. If you didn't like the show, your probably not going to like the movie. It'll probably satisfy former fans like myself and those that want some sci-fi action. I'd say of your even a little curious, then go go see this movie.",Power Rangers

The Power Rangers franchise started when media mogul Haim Saban adapted the Japanese franchise ""Super Sentai"" for American audiences (but using footage from the Japanese original). Since starting out as the Fox Kids TV series ""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers"" in 1993, Power Rangers series have been produced by various entertainment companies and aired on various networks in the U.S. and around the world (including, ironically, back in Japan, where the concept was born). The characters have also appeared in toy form, in comics and video games and, in 1995 and 1997, in low budget feature films. The action adventure sci-fi movie ""Power Rangers"" (PG-13, 2:04) (also called ""Saban's Power Rangers"") represents a reboot and an expansion of the cinematic part of the franchise.Let's meet the new Power Rangers! Jason Scott (Dacre Montgomery), the teenager who becomes the Red Ranger (the group's leader), is a high school football star who has pulled one too many stupid pranks and lost his chance to play football in college. He's now wearing an ankle monitor and attending detention every Saturday to make up for his most recent misdeeds. Soon-to-be Pink Ranger Kimberly Hart (Naomi Scott) is a cheerleader who has committed a cruel faux pas which has led to her falling out of favor with her clique and also landed her in detention. Blue Ranger Billy Cranston (RJ Cyler) is an autistic kid who gets picked on at school and is also serving some time in detention. Black Ranger Zack (Ludi Lin) is a loner who spends much of his time caring for his terminally ill mother. Last, but not least, is Yellow Ranger Trini (musician and model Becky G), also a loner, who happens to represent the Q in LGBTQ and is an outsider among this group of outsiders, who initially refer to her as ""crazy girl"".Jason, Kimberly and Billy meet ""Breakfast Club"" style in Saturday detention and they all end up together at a local quarry, where they attract the attention of Zack and Trini (who happen to be hanging out there, individually) when Billy blows off the side of a hill searching for something that his (deceased) miner father had told him about. What Billy's explosion reveals is a sheer, glass-like sheet of rock which contains five differently colored medallions (red, pink, blue, yellow and black) or ""coins"". Each of the teens takes a coin and each wakes up the next morning to the realization that some things are different about them, not the least of which is suddenly being in possession of extreme strength. After they get together at school and compare notes, they decide to get together that night at the quarry to figure out what is happening to them and why. That's where things morph into something mighty weird.When they reassemble at the quarry, and after they discover that they can also climb really fast and jump really far, they find that at the bottom of a deep chasm is a lake which leads to an underground cavern where they find an ancient alien space ship. They are greeted by a robot named Alpha 5 (voiced by Bill Hader and looking like a cross between other-than-human 1980s movie characters Johnny 5 from ""Short Circuit"" and ""E.T."" from well, you know). Alpha 5 wakes up a former Red Ranger named Zordon (voiced and acted via motion capture by Bryan Cranston, who did a couple voices in the original TV series). Zordon lost his team and his own life 65 million years earlier fighting against a rogue Green Ranger called Rita Repulsa. (Zordon's consciousness was preserved in a computer.) Zordon explains that Rita (Elizabeth Banks) is power hungry and ""pure evil"" so he banished her to the bottom of the sea, but she is coming back and is intent on stealing the Zeo Crystal, which is what makes life on earth possible. Despite his fully articulated doubts, Zordon says that, if these five teenagers have the coins, it's not an accident and they are meant to be the next group of Power Rangers. The new Rangers also have their doubts, but they think that this is all pretty cool and they go along with Zordon's physically demanding training program as they also work to come together as a team so they can morph into fully capable Power Rangers, able to defeat Rita and her huge golden monster, Goldar, thus saving their small town.""Power Rangers"" is a worthy successor and enjoyable update to the 1990s pop culture juggernaut. Writer John Gatins (""Need for Speed"") and director Dean Israelite (""Project Almanac"") give us authentic characters, appealing visuals, good action and they strike just the right balance between honoring their source material and updating it for a new generation. Playing the Power Rangers are relative unknowns, but they are well-cast and pleasingly diverse – both as actors and in character. However, that's one of the reasons (along with an unnecessarily crude scene very early in the movie and a smattering of adult language) that makes this the first Power Rangers movie to be rated ""PG-13"" and questionable for small children. This is also the first Power Rangers movie to be (slightly) over two hours long but it feels rushed. It's an effective launch for a 21st century film franchise, but there's a lot going on (which is both good news and bad news). Plus, there are a few too many big coincidences in assembling the new Power Rangers and fueling their adventure, but this is still a mostly well-executed and entertaining movie.

51,swilliky,A decent reboot of a childhood favorite,7,26 March 2017,"Updated and rebooted, the Power Rangers return to the big screen with some solid actors and a new set of teens to play the colorful superheroes. Following the general premise of the original show yet slightly askew, Jason (Dacre Montgomery) was a star football player who is injured in a car accident after pulling a prank and running from the police. Sent to detention, he meets Billy (RJ Cyler), an intelligent savant who pursues the mining hobby of his deceased father and Kimberly (Naomi Scott), a trouble popular girl. Convincing Jason to help him, Billy heads to a nearby mine to blow up an area he believes hides something special. Jason tries to ditch him but runs into Kimberly and they run back after hearing Billy's explosion. Also watching from a distance is Zack (Ludi Lin) who takes care of his young mother in a nearby trailer park and Trini (Becky G.), a loner who practices yoga amidst the rocks. The five teenagers discover colorful rocks and flee the mine security only to all crash in Billy's minivan with a train. They wake up not knowing what happened with incredible strength. Meanwhile, a fishing vessel picks up a corpse that comes alive to reveal the nefarious Rita Repulsa (Elizabeth Banks). She is on a quest to gather as much gold to build her super soldier Goldar.

52,markthomassintek,Kids will love it but,4,17 August 2017,"POWER RANGERS REVIEWOK honestly I didn't like the TV programmes so came to the film with my mind almost made up, wrong I know because I do pride myself on being independent and impartial when doing these reviews.The film, first half where they basically aquure the powers very enjoyable actually, with each character having a back story but I'm sorry to say that once they aquure their powers and start being the Power Rangers all of the hard work previously building up the story and characters is lost.Second half corny, cheesy and actually a disappointment because....... well if you ever watched the Power Rangers you can predict what's going to happen.Kids will love it but if your a grown up who watched it as a child....... well first half great second half 😞Rating 4 out of 10",Power Rangers
53,gavin-thelordofthefu-48-460297,"While not without it's problems, Power Rangers (2017) is a fun and entertaining reboot that honors the history of Power Rangers",7,14 April 2020,"In Angel Grove, five teenagers stumble upon an alien ship and meet Zordon and Alpha, a holographic projector who was the former Red Ranger and a robot, who recruits them on a mission to save their world from an evil threat known as Rita Repulsa, the former Green Ranger. They must train and learn to overcome their real life issues in order to do so.After the underperformance of Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie, plans for a reboot lasted for over a decade while Power Rangers would continue to receive multiple seasons. Later in 2017, the reboot got released in theaters on March 24 2017 to mixed reviews and became a box office flop due to it's competition against the Beauty and the Beast remake from Disney and Kong: Skull Island from Warner Bros, thus canceling a planned movie franchise.As a person who loves Power Rangers upon growing up watching the series, I felt really bad for this reboot. Yes, it does have problems and it's not a perfect film, but I thought it was fun and entertaining. Not only that, it does honor the history of Power Rangers to those who grew up with it.(Warning, this review does contain some bits of spoilers)The story does a really nice job in expanding on Power Rangers. There's a backstory to Zordon and Alpha and their connection to Rita Repulsa during their battle at the Cenozoic Era which is done very well in the beginning of the film. Also, the Power Rangers group including Jason, Kimberly, Billy, Trini, and Zack have been fleshed out as actual teenagers with attitudes when compared to the non-realistic goody good personalities of the original Mighty Morphin group (which isn't a bad thing mind you as it worked back at 1993, but it's understandable while many people who watched Power Rangers didn't like the Mighty Morphin group as time went by). And most importantly, Rita Repulsa's motivation in this reboot as to why being rejected her Green Ranger powers gives her a reason as to why she's evil and how she plans to conquer the world. Not to mention it references the Zeo Crystal became very relevant to the film's plot as it was supposed to set up future films which became very unlikely due to the film's failure at the box office.That being said, there some other things I liked about the film. The cinematography is very nice as is the look of the Command Center and Angel Grove, the darker tone is very welcomed while not without some bits of humor which for the most part is really hilarious. Also, the look of the Ranger designs is actually pretty good as it retains the same mouth pieces and animal-like helmets while fitting the tone nicely. Brian Tyler's score is riveting. It retains the same ""Go Go Power Rangers"" theme while giving itself it's own identity and gives the intense moments of the film some atmosphere. And last but not least the acting. Bryan Cranston (who voiced the two monsters of the week in Mighty Morphin Power Rangers) does a great job as Zordon, Bill Hader is very funny and yet very poignant as Alpha 5, and Elizabeth Banks is great as she gives Rita Repulsa a sense of menace and complexity. The actors who played the Power Rangers also did a good job too. Dacre Montgomery (who would later play Billy Hargrove in Season 2 of Stranger Things), Naomi Scott (who would later play Jasmine in Disney's live action remake of Aladdin), RJ Cyler (who starred in the Scream tv series), Becky G (a singer and guest star from Austin & Ally), and Ludi Linn (from Marco Polo, Aquaman, Black Mirror and the upcoming Mortal Kombat reboot in 2021), shines in their chemistry and like Rita, they also give some complexity as they explain their real life issues with each other thus making them very believable.However, there are some problems that needs to be addressed. First, there's the CGI. Now, I've seen films that have handled the CGI way better, but in this reboot, they look pretty much off especially the look of Zordon and Alpha 5 despite the 100 million dollar budget of the film. Second, the rangers themselves don't morph until the third act of the film which is very disappointing considering the posters. And also, in the third act of the film, the location of the Zeo crystal that was revealed felt pretty dumb to me (go watch the rest of the film and you'll understand why).So, overall, the Power Rangers 2017 reboot isn't perfect and it could've been much stronger, but it's still a fun and entertaining film that respects and honors the history of Power Rangers. It's a shame we didn't get a planned movie franchise since there's another reboot in the works, though. So, to those who haven't seen the film, this might worth watching. :)",Power Rangers
54,Snootz,Power Rangers lives up to its name,4,16 July 2017,"While not a ""bad"" movie, one has to realize that a movie named ""Power Rangers"" isn't going to appeal to much of anyone over 10 years of age. But beyond that, this flick is a slow-moving, anti-climatic, dull and insensible let-down of both scripting and directing.On the one hand, unlike Transformers one can always tell what is going on. But that's mainly because very little is going on. From the poorly-choreographed fight scenes to the lame dialog, Power Rangers is a yawner from beginning to end.On a positive note the armored suits were a step-up from the series. No more latex and spandex sissy-suits here; this is some decent (if colorful) battle armor. I would give them thumbs-up on the CGI but face it... at this period of time, basic CGI is old-hat and cliché. Booorrinnng. Not because I'm an action junkie but rather the exact opposite: action without substance is pointless (which is one reason I can't tolerate Transformers).The only thing that could have saved this movie would have been choosing another theme entirely. Then start with a story that's beyond the trite ""bad person wants to destroy everything"" plot, and some characters that are more than 2-dimensional attempts at failed sympathy votes.I would have given this 5 points except for the innuendos that children likely didn't understand and adults would consider and juvenile and offensive bathroom humor. That lost them one star that would have graded the film as ""mediocre"". As it is, 4 stars is generous. Next time people, find a better-quality outdated theme to re-hash. Or at least make a movie that doesn't drive even existing fans to wrist-slashing despair.",Power Rangers
55,CANpatbuck3664,Power Rangers Isn't Mind-Blowing but Its More Entertaining and More Ambitious Than I Expected,7,25 March 2017,"*Minor Spoilers Ahead* After a brief vision of some Rangers past in the Cenozoic Era (describing that scene would give too much away) we meet some of our current Power Rangers. Jason Scott (Dacre Montgomery) is pulling a prank by leading a cow into a locker room but he's interrupted by the police showing up to the school. He tries to drive away but he ends up causing an accident. He wrecks his knee in the process (prematurely ending his football career) and earns house-arrest and detention in the process. Also in that classroom serving detention are Kimberly (Naomi Scott) and Billy (RJ Cyler). Billy is autistic and is getting bullied by some other kids when Jason steps into protect him. To thank him, Billy offers to throw off the signal of his anklet and let him borrow his van. They venture out at night to a mine that Billy used to frequent with his dad (who is unfortunately deceased). After bumping into Kimberly unexpectedly, Jason is about to leave when Billy sets off an explosion in the mine. Two other teenagers Zack (Ludi Lin) and Trini (Becky G.) hear the explosion and come running. Under the rock is a thick glass-like substance with 5 different coloured stones buried beneath it. They hack them out and then flee the scene to avoid being caught by security.I watched the Power Rangers show when I was a kid but I was so young that I don't have finite memories or details from it. For a show that was known for how cheesy it could be, I was impressed with how they modernized the show for audiences today. Sure, this version was heavy on the CGI but the designs were a good mix of the familiar and the new. They put a lot of detail into story elements like the Ranger's backgrounds and while the tone of the movie fluctuates a lot (more on that later) I think they tried really hard to be innovative and bring fresh ideas to this potential franchise. I really liked how characters like Zordon, Alpha-5 and Rita Repulsa looked and the designs of the suits and even the Megazord were impressive.I mentioned character development and although the Rangers were all mildly annoying at different points in the story, (that's not the movie's fault, they're moody teenagers) Power Rangers gives each of the central cast strong motivations and a reason to yearn to inclusiveness. Their interactions with each other are relatively strong and their treatment of subjects that can be considered taboo were actually admirable (Billy being ""on the scale"" and Trini being LGBT). They don't skate over this stuff but they don't make a big deal of it either. They hit you over the head with how much these kids our outsiders but other than lacking some subtlety, Power Rangers treats these teenagers with respect and gives their actors/actresses the material to succeed.The Power Rangers themselves were all played by actors/actresses I hadn't heard of. I think they all do good work, I'd give the nod to RJ Cyler for being the standout. He would have been the comedic relief in any other movie but he's a nice balance of being funny and genuinely emotional. There wasn't a weak link among them. The movie also benefits from appearances by Bryan Cranston and Bill Hader. I was surprised Cranston would join this project but with his history in the show, he showed up to work and held up his end. Bill is always funny and Alpha-5 is a decent side-kick character. The actress I liked best in the movie was Elizabeth Banks as Rita Repulsa. She seemed like she was the one who really understood what the movie was going for. I'm a fan of hers, she has both comedic and dramatic chops in spades and she walked a delicate line between being a menacing villain and a scenery-chewing bad girl.I've had a lot of praise for Power Rangers so far but the movie does have a couple of problems. The first and probably the most important is that it can't escape how cheesy the show's subject matter was. They try to create realistic characters but the more fantastical elements of the show come off as corny. There were some times that I couldn't help but roll my eyes or laugh even sitting around serious fans. It stopped me from completely getting into the movie. The other thing is that Power Rangers might have the most obvious and ridiculous bit of product placement in a wide release movie that I've ever seen. It was actually jarring and impossible not to snicker at (I won't say what the company was but they must have paid a serious portion of the budget).The subject matter of Power Rangers seemed suited for younger kids but with how dark the subject matter is at specific points (there are scenes with Rita Repulsa that almost seem like they were lifted out of a horror movie), I wouldn't recommend it for really young children. This movie will play really well for fans, I saw it with a friend who was a big fan of the show and he left the theatre ecstatic. This movie was better than it had any right to be and I could easily see it jump-starting a franchise. I can't say I loved it but I would give it a solid 6.5/10 rounding up to a 7.",Power Rangers
56,destroyerwod,"Much better than expected, still has some flaws tough, but fun !",7,27 August 2018,"So i decided i was gonna go full spoiler for this review cause lets face it, if you watched the show in the 90s you already know what Power Rangers is. I would like to start by the negatives and finish on the positives. So first of all i am not a fan of the race swapping they did for the main characters. I supose its to please the SJWs and commit to our ""political correctness era"" wich i am not fond of, but in the end it just make the movie a bit weird without a good reason. So right out the bat Jason and Kimberly are done right. There a bit more flawed than the show happy goodies version, but they are close enough. The problem comes with the yellow, blue and black rangers that they race swapped. So basically Billy is now african-american, Zack is asian and Trini is hispanic. Its kinda funny how they mention Jason, Kim and Billy's last name but never do it for Zack or Trini. Lets just say Trini Kwan does not sound very hispanic and Zack Taylor does not sound very asian either. When it comes to Billy his genius persona is kept but for Zack and Trini they go opposite direction. Now i think changing them a bit to make a more original movie is fine, but they didn't need to race swap them for that. Zack could had still be african-american and act differently. Anyway rant on this is over. When it comes to the other changes like for instance having Zordon as the original Red Ranger and Rita as the original Green Ranger, i think it worked very fine. The movie set up a possible sequel to introduce Tommy and they could do the geen ranger saga perfectly that way. Rita's new appearance didn't bother me either. On the other hand i wish Goldar would had been closer to the show version, as in a monster in a gold armor instead of just a faceless gold monster. Also another issue i had with the movie was that despite being called Power Rangers, they barely are in the suits only for the final act and most of it happen in the Zords. I would had love to see more hand to hand fights in there power suits and maybe show there unique weapons for all Rangers and not just Jason. But despite all i just said, actually the movie is fairly entertaining. I wish i would had seen more ""rangers"" but the character developement and the bonding between the characters was actually handle well. Instead of being all friends like at the beginning of the old show, they are all different and come together due to circonstances. They get to know each other with time and develop there friendship and eventually realize they need each others. I enjoyed that aspect. The final act was also very well done, i love seeing the Zords fight individually as we saw very few of that in the show. The new Megazord was cool too. In the end i actually had more fun than i tough i would with the movie and despite my negatives wich seem bigger than the positives in this review, i would rate the movie positively. As a fan of the show i actually enjoyed the new looks of the rangers(even if so few of them), the new zords/megazord, Ritas and even Alpha wich i was not fond of in the first promo photos, i think he came out very ok in the movie. I really hope they eventually do a sequel. Especially since they set it so well. I recommand that you watch this with a few beers tough (if you are of age obviously) and it made me got more into the movie that i think i would if i didn't drank.",Power Rangers

59,LloydBayer,Power Rangers is nothing but a silly attempt at grabbing a slice of the market share in superhero films.,4,22 March 2017,"You know Hollywood is running out of ideas when a hallmark TV series is made into a big screen production, and then recycled and redecorated with a bigger budget for a new generation. That's perfectly acceptable with franchises like the Jurassic Park films, where sequels are released every decade or so and aimed at a specific cluster of the audience. Power Rangers, on the other hand, has no idea who its target audience is and here's probably why: a suit from Lionsgate (yes, Lionsgate) green- lit the reboot even as the TV series is still being aired, hired screenwriters who wrote superhero films like X-Men: First Class and producers from the Transformers franchise, then hired unknown actors and a newbie director before ending up with a PG-13 fiasco that's neither here nor there. At just over 120 minutes, it's highly unlikely this film will grab and hold the attention of children, whereas anyone over 40 expecting a glorious heist or scandalous bachelor party is in for the wrong film. This leaves us with older teens widely known as the YA crowd (young adults). Now here's the caveat: Back in the early '90s, superheroes films were limited to one-off appearances a year. 25 years later and there are no less than five superhero films a year (this year we have six including one animation) from stalwart studios with an ever increasing budget and fan base. Yet as a superhero origins film, the new Power Rangers film simply doesn't stack up to the expectations of the general audience, let alone teenagers who expect nothing but cutting edge effects in a mega bucks franchise. So while lacking a target audience, the bigger question is why a reboot after more than 20 years? Cashing in on the current superhero culture seems like an obvious motive, but the disparity in production quality is even more obvious from the opening scene right through to the end. Except for some campy moments from Elizabeth Banks as a gold digging alien witch (How's Rita Repulsa for camp?) there is no other character worth caring about, not even the titular high school misfits who discover extraordinary abilities but are too dumb to figure out their purpose as a team of intergalactic warriors. Sadly, Power Rangers turns out to be a cinematic misfire that should have gone straight to TV. But even then, titles from Netflix and Amazon Studios far outweigh this debacle whose only purpose appears to be a disappearing act in your wallet.",Power Rangers
60,p-jonsson,I am surprised to say that it was actually watchable,6,31 May 2017,"Buying this movie was of course pretty much a request from my kids although I have to confess that I, as a Science Fiction geek, was at least a tiny bit interested in seeing what they had managed to cook together on a big budget. For the record I find the television show absolutely awful. Therefore I am quite surprised that I found the movie to be not exactly good but at least watchable.Make no mistake, it is indeed a silly and simple plot, teenage wet dream, stupid and illogical kind of story that you would expect. However, it was actually mildly fun to watch. Most of my enjoyment came from the special effects and action sequences of course. The dialog and behavior of the teenage heroes were as stereotyped and generally awful as one would expect.This of course means that the first half of the movie is less interesting than the second half when the action picks up. Actually, although there are some fun moments during ""training"", I felt this entire idea of them not being able to use their powers before they had gotten into the right ""mental state"" to prove that they were actually Power Rangers was just a rubbish one.Once things started to pick up speed it became more interesting. The different means of transport of the Power Rangers was absolutely silly but still great fun to watch.Well, I really do not have that much more to say. The last parts of the movie was one big special effects feast with a few comic elements in it, most of them rather  teenage. Fun to watch for a science fiction geek like me.So, the verdict? Was it a fun movie to watch? Yeah, it was pretty okay. Was it a good movie? Well, that is probably stretching it.",Power Rangers
61,EthanBJones_03,Mmm... Krispy Kreme Donuts; Recommend just for the product placement alone.,4,21 May 2017,"Power Rangers(2017) was directed by Dean Israelite and stars Dacre Montgommery, Elizabteth Banks, Krispy Kreme Donuts and RJ Cyler. Five ordinary teens must become something extraordinary when they learn that their small town of Angel Grove - and the world - is on the verge of being obliterated by an alien threat. Chosen by destiny, our heroes quickly discover they are the only ones who can save the planet. But to do so, they will have to overcome their real-life issues and before it's too late, band together as the Power Rangers.I won't claim to be a Krisp... Power Rangers expert but what I will say is that this movie blows. I mean the acting was competent and it was well shot but I mean it's got no substance and too little Krispy Kreme Donuts. If you are a long time fan of Power Rangers, you may very well like this movie. I have watched Power Rangers but I know enough about it to make an educated review but I just cannot say this movie is even remotely good. The story is bad. 'Nuff said.All of the actual 'Power Rangers' did good performances(much to my surprise) and thoroughly impressed. Despite this we all know that Krispy Kreme Donuts were the best actors in this movie. I mean they are chameleons. They didn't even need to be on screen for that long and they stole the show. They blended into the background like a dog blends into the road(If this offends you then I'm sorry but I actually don't care). Elizabeth Banks was awfully cheesy as Rita Repulsa and really didn't fit with the tone of the movie. Rita Repulsa was an extremely weak villain and was just plain boring.Technically, this movie is fine. It's a well shot movie and the way they blend Krispy Kreme Donuts into the background was pure artistic genius. The effects were really unbelievably but ultimately looked pretty cool and the costume design was also pretty decent.This movie's main two areas of focus are the action and comedy. It provides good action which is childish fun for the eyes but lacks any good comedy or real jokes. If you proof of that then keep in mind the first joke of the movie is about 'violating' a cow to be 'polite'. In conclusion, I imagine true fans of Power Rangers will enjoy this movie but aside from that I don't see this movie getting much critical praise and I don't really recommend it.4/10",Power Rangers
62,Mike_Devine,Someone forgot to power up these 'Rangers',3,31 March 2018,"Long ago, the Power Rangers were an insanely popular force to be reckoned with. Nowadays, they're only really good for 30-something fanboys who are feeling nostalgic, despite the fact that there have been iterations upon iterations of series developed to keep interest alive.In 2017's 'Power Rangers,' Lionsgate aimed to recharge the aging franchise by injecting young up-and-coming actors and a healthy dose of CGI in the hopes of capturing success a la 'Transformers.' Unfortunately, the quality here fell way short of expectations, with cheesy dialogue, cheap action sequences and poor acting. From an acting perspective, the young troupe of actors deliver boring performances as misfit teenagers turned quasi-superheroes. The only real bright spot is Elizabeth Banks' portrayal of the alien witch Rita Repulsa, who has been reimagined to be a fierce killer bent on destroying Earth. The vocal talents of Bryan Cranston (as Zordon) and Bill Hader (as Alpha 5) are pretty much throwaways and don't amount to much here,Another flaw in 'Power Rangers' is its pacing. The film starts out very slow, then seems to sprint through the rest of the sequence of events in the blink of an eye. The little character development that happens is focused on the imperfections of each ranger's life and why they want to escape their struggles for something better. Sure, it's fair to say there are a lot of social and societal lessons and commentaries baked into 'Power Rangers,' but these do nothing to elevate the film as a whole. Even the final moments of the climactic battle are underwhelming.While credit is probably due for making another attempt to breathe life into 'Power Rangers,' the execution here is poor. When it comes to making movies about well-established pop culture subjects, that really hurts.",Power Rangers
63,James_De_Bello,5/10,5,7 April 2017,"When five teenagers get lost and find themselves in the midst of a gold mine they discover something special: five colored coins in the middle of the rocks. When they start experiencing out of the ordinary events they come back together and figure out that there might be something special to what has happened to them.Dean Israelite clearly demonstrates a passion for this project and I must admit that how the whole thing came together with Lionsgate behind made me actually curious to check out this update, I was somewhat intrigued by the voice and style they were putting behind the film and I, in a way, was right to do so: the first 50 minutes of the film gave me something special, it is sad that they had to be lessened by another hour of complete tonal shift.When I say I was into this film for the fist half or so I mean it literally. This film really surprised and got to me up until then, Israelite was doing some really solid directing, the action scenes were visceral and done in one shot, almost all of the fluff was absent and it left space for some solid and effective character development. I remember having a moment in the theater where I thought that this was actually very solid writing: there were different thrusts being developed efficiently and the screenplay was carrying out smart character touches.The editing was sporadically jarring, but the use of the camera was definitely making up for it: the first five shots of this film have two long takes of action that were genuinely stunning and absorbing. The characters come together in an organic way, defying genre clichés and making for a group of quirky individuals that have an identity and a place with one another, they are all outlined with personal characteristics and become instantly recognizable.Unfortunately after the very inspiring first half there is not much to add here. It seems like they just forgot what movie they were making in the second half. The characters loose grit by being put on a journey that isn't interesting and does not develop them. Tonally the film enters a big shift and starts going for fluff out of nowhere. Israelite seems to forget how to direct interesting action and the whole last act is a disaster of fast paced cutting, not understanding what is going on and overall total loss of affection for anyone involved.It is sad that a film that started out with such a bang in action and character becomes a totally different one by the end and leaves me with so little to add. There is no silver lining, it's just a very disappointing first half that completely undoes what the first one did, it changes in every aspect from the characters and the the tone to the how the action is shot and the CGI is used making ""Power Rangers"" all in all an average effort with a very promising start.",Power Rangers

This was PR, and based on the original classic TV show that has millions of fans and a cult like following.PLOT: Five Teens with too much attitude and zero likability and no real reason to be liked become heroes. This is what this movie was. It was jumbled mess and poorly written and acted. When you saw Elizabeth Banks cast as Rita, you knew it was already a shiitshow! ACTING/SCRIPT: The unknown actors couldn't really act and neither can Banks. Well at least as Rita. Besides the terrible script, the line delivery was a mess. The Teens had problems, but nothing that made you feel sorry for them. Each teen seemed to be awful people, and at no point does the writers attempt or at least succeed in making you like them. Everyone is a rule breaker, a bad boy or a bad girl.WRITING/CASTING: It felt the director and studio simply wanted diversity of cast rather than actors who can act. No one really fit their role outside and that includes miss banks. The studio seemed more interested in diversity and political correctness than the script.CGI/ACTION: The biggest flaw was the CGI. It's the easy way out and always seems to be the downfall of modern movies. The fight sequences were poorly done and hard to follow but. This was a bad movie without the heart of the original TV show and a jumbled mess. The music score also deserves a nod for how terrible it was.This Version of PR is a Bay-esque, poorly written, shot, acted and CGI-ed mess. Fans deserved better.",Power Rangers
65,kermitkid,Live-action Saturday Morning show perfectly met expectations,7,30 March 2020,"To be honest, I got pretty much what I expected with this movie. I thought at best it would be average, and at worst it would be a dumpster fire, like ""Fant4stic"". And yeah, it was perfectly average. A lot could have been improved, changed, and taken out, but at the end of the day, I was entertained. I wasn't checking how much runtime was left, or praying for the sweet release of the end credits, but I wouldn't exactly recommend this film to anybody either. It's entertaining, but not exactly a film I'm clamoring to watch again. The film did suffer from a lot of problems. The chemistry between the 4 leads was awful. The runtime is 2 hours and 15 min, and for a movie called ""Power Rangers"" and it takes almost 2 hours of that for them to actually become the Power Rangers. Instead, they fill up the time with teen angst and drama. It felt like I was watching a Disney Channel movie or something on Freeform. There was one part where a character supposedly died, but I honestly didn't care because not enough time was spent on their character development. I was indifferent to what happened to these characters. Also, they hired Bryan Cranston, but just like in 2014's ""Godzilla,"" he's barely in it, and his talent is wasted. Bill Hader got more screentime. Bill Hader! I like Bill Hader, but in small incriments. He was in this wasy too much. By far, the best part of the movie was Elizabeth Banks' performance as the villain. She went over-the-top without overdoing it. Just a classic Saturday morning cartoon style villain who enjoys being evil for the sake of being evil. The first half of the movie did give me a sense of deja vu, as it felt a little too much like someone was trying to do a remake of ""Chronicle."" There are very few times where I praise the score of a movie, but I have to here. I loved the score. It sounded like the soundtrack to ""Tron: Legacy."" I'm glad I didn't pay to see this in theaters, but it was worth a rent. If you're at Redbox, and this is in stock, and there's nothing else you want to see, it's worth at least one watch.

67,ayoreinf,Way way better than the original,8,27 March 2017,"Being all grown up when the original hit the TV screens, it soon became one of my silliest guilty pleasures. I did like Amy Jo Johnson, who probably launched her career with the series, but she was the single redeeming element in a real stupid series. No real characters, so obviously no real character growth, stupid methodical breaks for morphing time at every stage of morphing they went through, and the lame lame jokes with Bulk and Skull. Still I had to see what they made with the original, so I went to see it on the big screen.This is so much better in comparison with the original I should have rated it off the chart. But even as stand alone movie, it's not a bad one. To begin with we get real characters here, and they do go through some real character growth. It does include some cheesy moments, but as rule the actors are all doing their job well, some even better than well. That is R.J. Cyler and Becky G and Naomi Scott. So the Bulk and Skull jokes are gone, replaced by some real live bullying. The detention room does feel a bit like a recycling of The Breakfast Club, but it's a real minor issue. Rita Repulsa is a real villain here. - Elizabeth Banks is really super in this role, I wish they gave her more screen time.So this is my bottom line. It's definitely a decent fantasy comics action movie, just please don't call it sci-fi, simply have fun watching it.",Power Rangers

70,shobanchittuprolu,"Power Rangers really makes us question ""Who the heck asked for this crappy reboot""?",5,24 September 2017,"Power Rangers (2017): A whole generation of youngsters will never forget watching Power Rangers which has lot of iterations inspired stupid children everywhere to karate chop their friends and enemies. Naturally, it was only a matter of time before it was reconstituted into a feature film and inflicted upon the poor old unsuspecting world.But unfortunately, this reboot strains so hard to distance itself from the original TV series, it could spoil your childhood memories.Plot: High school outcasts Jason Scott/Red Ranger (Dacre Montgomery), Kimberly/Pink Ranger (Naomi Scott), Billy/Blue Ranger (RJ Cyler), Zack/Black Ranger (Ludi Lin), Trini/Yellow Ranger (Becky G.) stumble upon an old alien ship, where they acquire superpowers and are dubbed the Power Rangers. Learning that an old enemy of the previous generation has returned to exact vengeance, the group must harness their powers and use them to work together and save the world.My Review: To go through everything wrong with Power Rangers will require more typing than there is time in the world. Its most unforgivable sin is that IT'S SO BORING.It really should not be that hard to inject life into a story about five high school kids with superpowers.Yet, it takes 90 minutes for the heroes to get suited up - which for anyone hoping to see a film about Power Rangers will not seem fair and to make it worse a theme song plays in background ""Go!Go!Power Rangers""(Should I have to go away and quit watching this?). Even then, they almost instantly get into their dinosaur-shaped Zord vehicles for the remainder of the film. That means we get to watch the actors reacting in cockpits. We watch them making ""Wow"" faces. What... a... thrill.And the major problem is that it seriously tries to impress adults by some crude remarks which are totally out-of-place and the movie was supposed to be PG.Well the female rangers' suits are worse – the whole focus of the women's costumes becomes their breasts (when the original didn't even have this sort of sexualisation).The only pro of this movie is its cast.The ace of the five is Cyler (eternally great in Me and Earl and the Dying Girl), who brings a manic energy and big heart to the picture as Billy. Even in such confused trash as this, he's a bonafide star.Others are also very good.So,Power Rangers really makes us question ""Who the heck asked for this crappy reboot""?

71,Quebec_Dragon,Power puttering out after a promising start,4,22 March 2017,"I'm a guy in his early forties who usually loves (good) superhero movies. I've only caught a few episodes of Power Rangers here and there over the years, found it campy, predictable fun, but wasn't really a fan. I write this so you know where this opinion comes from. So after a promising start in the distant past and some high-school hi-jinks with a bunch of misfits/rejects, something strange started happening. As more and more fantastical elements were introduced, the more I felt underwhelmed and doubtful. Not quite sure when it started, but it was particularly obvious with the introduction of the Zorgs (robot-dinosaur vehicles) that was very lacklustre. The Zorg designs might have been too ""detailed"", but I even had trouble making out what dinosaur they were supposed to be. To be fair, I love the new Ranger outfits although, once again, their first appearance was kind of muffed.The plot that seemed not so bad at first with actual character building got stupid and corny pretty fast with dumb decisions from both the heroes (yes, let's all jump) and the lame main villain (let's end all life on Earth with me on it, because, uh...). The actors certainly tried hard, were probably better than standard TV actors, but they didn't sell the touching or dramatic scenes to me. Then again, I also blame the script. However, the highlight acting-wise was the young black man called RJ Cyler in an autistic role (despite too much makeup). But beyond the plot and acting, kind of secondary in that type of film, there should have been a building sense of wonder and excitement that wasn't really there for me. The visual effects were hit (Zordon on the wall) and miss (the Zorgs). The fights that should have been thrilling seemed mostly unexciting and uninspired to me, especially the last one. So without the nostalgia factor in its favour, this big-budget remake didn't make a Power Rangers fan out of me.Rating: 3.5 out of 10 (mediocre)P.S. A really obnoxious product placement actually got some of the few good laughs.",Power Rangers
72,SyoKennex,Did the director watch any Power Rangers media before making this?,4,7 January 2020,"I was just going to leave a half funny comment on this and leave but I can't.First of All, Zordon being a dick? Bryan Cranston did an amazing job as Zordon but being a twat to the Rangers because he's grumpy about being locked up? That's not Zordon. That is everything Zordon is not.And Kimberly????? Kimberly is a kind hearted girl who would babysit disabled children, learned and taught sign language for her deaf cousin and taught kids gymnastics even when she was busy. Sure she can be a bit stuck up at times but Kimberly is NOT the type of girl to send someone's nudes around school? She's a very rarely sometimes sort of stuck up popular girl but she's NOT the kind of girl to do that? At all? She's the kind of girl who would defend whoever this happened to. She wouldn't ridicule someone like that.The suits??? What the hell was the suits???? They were using everyone's original suit designs so I don't get why they had to sci-fi/cyber them up? The original suits in slightly off colour (darker pink, lighter yellow, etc) would have worked just fine. Also why are their faces reveleased in the Zords? The Rangers never had their face on show incase of emergency, ie their zord got wrecked, leaving them without a helmet covering their face.
Also Kimberly's Zord burning and her struggling? It's been proven in numerous form of the PR universe that Zords have mechanics incase of this? It was a pathetic call back to Kimberly being a damsel in distress.Did the director see a single piece of the Power Rangers verse before this film? I see the way he was trying to go for this film but it fell massively flat.The 2 stars are for Ludi Lin and RJ Cyler, the original theme being used when they first the Zords, and for the Megazord not looking like crap.The fact this is some kids first ever viewing of the PR verse breaks my heart.",Power Rangers
73,FallenEye,Go Go and Come Back Better Power Rangers.,5,22 January 2018,"The story never needed to be unprecedented or filled with twists, it just needed to be a simple ""kids turning into superheroes and saving the world"", and I'm glad that that's exactly what they did, however still in taking that simple route, Power Rangers was missing texture and focus.That simple story with magnificent execution would've turned this movie all the way up, but Dean got lost in trying to draw emotion, create a connection, add humour and showcase spectacular action sequences, and frustratingly kept falling short every time.The sound mixing, sound editing and score were almost amateur, and the direction and cinematography (especially with the final battle) was, terrible really, and the combination of all I just mentioned created these awkward gaps throughout the movie.The beginning of the movie is pretty fun though. These kids who don't know each other from a bar of soap, discovering a new world and powers while living our childhood fantasy of heroism and secrecy... It really just needed to be that simple.It sucks that this film wasn't as good as it really could've been, especially because Power Rangers has all it needs to be an epic series. Perhaps if we're lucky, Lionsgate may want to give that sequel a shot, because our interest is still there, but they'll have to bring it twice, three times as hard this time around. 5.4/10.",Power Rangers
74,austin0731,The modern rendition of the world's favourite Mighty morphers,6,30 March 2017,"Power rangers is the modern rendition of the classic TV series of the same name and reimagines the cheesy franchise into a modern more serious version. It stars 5 teenagers, 'outsiders' and 'misfits' as they are joined together by fate and are tasked to become the 'Power Rangers' a superhero team tasked with protecting these 'Zeo crystals'.The movie really was building up to be a very well done and emotionally investing superhero origin story but everything really goes downhill after the team 'suits up' in its final act to battle the villain played by Elizabeth Banks, the evil Rita Repulsa hell bent on destroying this small town and eventually the world? So as I said, I really liked the first half of this film where we really get to sympathize with these characters, they were both likable and relatable, especially the blue ranger who I was really afraid would reel towards the annoying side, I am glad that it didn't go that way. The film had a more serious tone and had real emotional moments which I as one who has not seen the originals suspect was not a theme in the originals at all. This was all great and all and I really wished this trend had carried through the entire film. However once we are introduced to Rita Repulsa who acts as this over the top and ridiculous character the film starts to go down hill. The power rangers battle these golem things that she summons and that fight choreography is seriously flawed and uninspiring. You could argue that this was trying to stay true to the series' over the top cheesy aura but then why would you build up the first half to be such a more mature film?So to finalize, I must conclude that this is a pretty good attempt to revive the franchise and is a solid first film for potential sequels. I really enjoyed what they did in the first half of this film so I do hope that this is what they stick to in the future.",Power Rangers
75,asifahsankhan,It's Morphin' Time. . .? (Really?),4,2 June 2017,"Whenever Hollywood attempts to reboot a beloved, preexisting property on the big screen, it always feels more or less reconstructed in a way to be more accessible for all kinds of audiences, and less specific than the original incarnation may have ever been. The best thing that can be said about 2017's Power Rangers then - Saban and Lionsgate's new attempt at bringing the iconic title back to life as a large scale blockbuster - is that it doesn't ever feel like it betrays the core values of the Power Rangers franchise.First things first: Elizabeth Banks. She all but guarantees ""Power Rangers"" will not quite be yet another CGI special-effects franchise nostalgia superhero extravaganza. In her characterisation of alien vileness Rita Repulsa, she goes far, far over the tipsiest of tops, showing splendid awareness of how far-beyond-stoop-id the movie is.That's a complicated way of saying Rita has no eyebrows, and acts like people with no eyebrows in movies often do, i.e., a total meanie.Bless Banks for cutting a campy swath through a movie that very much needs it. Otherwise, ""Power Rangers"" is a mess, unsure whether it should be a kitschy throwback romp or ultramodern emo-reboot. A person could pull a groin jerking from tone to tone. I will say the film's visual palette, a convincing blend of CGI and practical effects, is distinctive, ambitious and sometimes impressively weird. It's just too bad such creativity is at the service of this dumb movie. For an early action sequence, director Dean Israelite (""Project Almanac"") employs a swivelling POV camera in the back of a speeding truck; employing this type of virtuoso technique for a ""Power Rangers"" movie is akin to carving SpongeBob SquarePants from a block of Italian marble.The film begins auspiciously, with a subtitle reading ""PLANET EARTH: CENOZOIC ERA,"" and Bryan Cranston grunting impenetrable dialogue from behind heavy alien makeup. I steeled myself for the worst. It gets worse before it gets better: Cut to the modern day (what, no subtitle reading ""65 MILLION YEARS LATER""?), when small-town high- school football star Jason (Dacre Montgomery) admits to milking a cow, although he didn't realise it was actually a bull until he examines its undercarriage, its genitalia photographed in disturbing close-up.So immediately, this ""Power Rangers"" establishes its audience as grown-up kids who played with the toys and watched the television show in the 1990s, not the eight-year-oldies currently trawling the Target aisle for branded laser swords. Notably, it's also rife with scenes of pervasive violence, a criticism frequently levied at the ""Power Rangers"" franchise in its heyday of popularity. But in that sense, it's similar to the recent ""Transformers"" and ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" movies, which also reconfigured youth-culture franchises into ugly displays of digital Noe-realist carnage. Power Rangers likely won't do much for those who never liked the property in the first place. But for those who grew up with it, or found it through the many different incarnations throughout the years, it provides the kind of passionate, loving reboot that we very rarely see from the studio system nowadays - one that goes deeper into its mythology without ever losing the camp element that made it so much fun in the first place. While it doesn't quite pull off everything it wants to, but it's a fun time at the theatre nonetheless.",Power Rangers
76,FelipeCarrillo,Substantial Opulence & Thin Tangibility,6,20 July 2017,"It's clear that with the passing of the years our sphere is transfigured and our outlook on life is attached with the presented updates. The 1990s supposed a range of cinematographic parables and personalities with mere budgetary intentions, however, these products built infancy and youth of men and women with a mixture of eyewash and absurdity dressed up in laughable clothes. In simultaneous, these ones established the foundations of contemporary pop-culture by means of certain patterns and artistic commercial manifestations. Haim Saban created, set up and distributed a show intended for young audiences with the verbose title ""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers"", a series based on the Japanese saga ""Super Sentai Series"" and won an incredible success not only in English speaking countries, but around the world, achieving the status of popular icon. Later, there were two more rounds of episodes and two audiovisual productions inciting the fervent appreciation for the the quintet of teens who fought in Japan but resided in the United States. Today, Dean Israelite presents the third in the franchise, which is an installment that feeds American leisure to create modernizations of films which generated a determined impact in past ages, only this time, curiously, the process is reversed: The 2017 graphics aren't the most important renovation in the story are the treatment and conception of the coming-of-age characters which stand out on screen, where action/adventure sequences, by which the most avid spectators attended movie theaters (adding a dose of pure nostalgia around the series and original film), are placed in the penultimate position in order of importance, anomalous statement keeping in mind Hollywood's cinematic predilections.First and foremost, the weight of transforming a visually cartoonish concept into an interesting and coherent plot falls on screenwriter John Gatins, undeniably. Gatins doesn't shake off giving stereotyped profiles to the leading roles, but he gets rid of showing them in a methodical and jerky way, he provides sketched characters to the indicated interpreters, in addition, keeps a surprising fidelity leaving intact the basic components. It's a shame that this fierce and warlike harmony of introduction isn't injected into all the feature film. The various situations that it inserts around the characters, which serve to reveal who or what they're, are known, but acceptable, and in certain instants are enjoyable such as the campfire scene or in which knacks of the young cast are evidenced, not in overblown effects or plot twists, circumstances where the soul is naked and the ears are wide open. Second, the film falls on the shoulders of Dean Israelite, not very frequented filmmaker to direct a blockbuster of that caliber, but he's an expert executing a carefree tone. Perhaps, Lionsgate made this signing as an incentive, in order to the director, provides part of tone and form of the story of travels through time to the idea. It's clear, Israelite doesn't possess the required acuity to express with panache and subtlety the key action sequences, therefore, he prioritizes the characters, which is an appropriate determination. However, when you're responsible for carrying out a mega-production, you must lead every minimum job with a successful tact. Abrupt pace changes in certain scenes, hand-held shots, and fast cuts make it intelligible and unenjoyable what should be enjoyable; the visual effects are decent and the new designs of the costumes, the Zords, and the Megazords aren't entirely bad.Last but not least, it's the heterogeneous casting. Israelite and his the crew took their time to find the favorable actors, and they found them. They opted, thank goodness, not to select a rubicund stereotyped woman or American husky heartthrob, the chosen ones are facing favorably unknown, unknown but with many talents to explore. Dacre Montgomery, Naomi Scott, RJ Cyler, Ludi Lin and Becky G. are officially the new Power Rangers, those that could be the popular icons of the post-millennium generation, although it's an uncertain future, with Marvel and DC monopolizing the sector at present.In addition to the newcomers and their laborious performances, it's only two great stars are meddled within the novice cast: Elizabeth Banks, trying to replace the new Teffie from ""The Hunger Games"" and Bryan Cranston, who runs a fascinating prolog but a bittersweet appearance on a wall.Everyone feared with what Dean Israelite could do, who could destroy a franchise and a pop icon in pieces with the fire of his ambitions or could expand the radar and get a handful of fans who support the invention of more adventures with Saban's team. The director is placed in the middle of the bifurcation. Visually, it doesn't take advantage of all its possibilities, being severely affected by the dizzying frenzied scenes, however, we can affirm that the area of characters is as well sketched as presented, successfully introduced, opening the door to a couple of doses more of Morphin' Time. With two unforgettable scenes and the interesting new Rangers, Dean Israeli's ""Power Ranges"" isn't the hollow popcorn movie we expected, however, it's not what we weren't looking forward to; a super production that falls in certain details with what failed in ""Fox's F4ntastic"" in 2015, but surprisingly gives the protagonism to those who really belong it, the heroes.",Power Rangers

78,PetarNeo,Big flop,3,4 April 2017,"There was a huge anticipation for this movie and considering there was a 20 years between first on screen Rangers this was a potentially big hit but things went really in bad direction from the beginning. Dean Israelite gets a chance for his big directorial debut in this large scale movie but drops us a C-movie with not so good directing, which is choppy and doesn't gets us sucked enough to consider it to be a really enjoyable movie. Movie feels completely stolen from the writing forward and it there is a huge resemblance to other movies which starts to feel annoying and there is a constant pursuit for characters which could possibly add something good the movie. Jason Scott/Red Ranger (Dacre Montgomery) is the problematic star of them all and his effort in uniting and starting to matter again is well done. Kimberly Hart/Pink Ranger (Naomi Scott) is probably the weakest part of movie because she tries matter in movie but her scenes are easily forgotten. Billy Cranston/Blue Ranger (RJ Cyler) was better part and there are quite few mysteries that resemble with him but RJ kept us interested in him because of his charisma and likeness that he brought with his character. Trini Kwan/Yellow Ranger (Becky G) was the most random character and everything about her feels artificial and she was a really bad add to the crew. Zack Taylor/ Black Ranger (Ludi Lin) brought some story with him that was actually helpful in his representation but it was all in vain because of his irritating and badly written actions that he featured. Alpha 5 is the best part of the movie because he was funny and always on high note with his actions and he stole every scene that he was in. Zordon (Bryan Cranston) was as good as was bad but he also lacked a importance and that resulted in meaningless scenes that weren't quite good. Rita Repulsa (Elizabeth Banks) was quite good in her portrayal and it was interesting to watch her but her character looks very funny shown on screen and there looks like she hasn't much power. Story behind whole Power Rangers looks ridiculous and there are large issues with many scenes that were shot and without many explanation. It felt like a bad movie with some cool tech but bad directing and probably good story that featured not so good acting and not giving us experience that was looked for. 1.5/4",Power Rangers

If you don't know what Ultraman is look it up its the same thing but in Japan. Saban's Power Rangers follows five ordinary teens who must become something extraordinary when they learn that their small town of Angel Grove — and the world — is on the verge of being obliterated by an alien threat. Chosen by destiny, our heroes quickly discover they are the only ones who can save the planet. But to do so, they will have to overcome their real-life issues and before it's too late, band together as the Power Rangers. I was mainly watching this for the action and fight scenes which they're very little of in this movie. It does have a cool opening sequence with Rita killing the other rangers on some far away planet, I'd like too see that movie instead of this one it looked a lot more interesting than the actual movie itself. Jason is getting into trouble by stealing a cow(what the heck) and ends up in detention meets Billy, they find the ranger crystals with three other teenagers on the mountains Zach, Trixi and Kimberly. When they decide to go back because they become super strong after having been in a car crash they soon discover a spaceship underground where Alpha five voiced by Bill Hader is there to greet them. Zordon is awaken and tells that Rita Repulsa is coming to collect gold to build Goldon(I think it was called) and will destroy the earth. I liked some of the actors like Bill Hader as Alpha five was cool and Bryan Cranston but not the main squad. They just seemed forgettable the only memorable one is Trixi and that's just because she's played by Becky G who's just hot. I liked Elizabeth Banks costume and performance as Rita Repulsa, even if she was one dimensional as a villain I really didn't care. I don't know anything about Power Rangers except that was stupid cheesy and fun, this movie tries to be that but fails. I mean it should have been forty to fifty minutes in and see the suits and I mean all of them not just one but no we got wait through teenage bull that looks like Chronicle.

82,tr91,Power Rangers,7,22 June 2017,"Most people had already decided that this film was going to be bad, so you knew it would get panned either way.I liked the original show as a kid in the 90s but with the numerous spin off shows and movies that followed, I never really stuck with the series. I got older and simply moved on to different things. Apart from the basics, my memory of Power Rangers had pretty much faded. This isn't exactly a film that we needed but I thought it's 2017, it probably has a big budget so it may well be fun. While I found it to be watchable, there was plenty of faults that even a casual viewer will notice. The story is simple but takes way too long to get going. There is simply not enough material here to warrant a 2 hour run time. There isn't really anything exciting about any of the characters and the first half just shows them meeting each other. I liked Billy (pretty funny) the most. OK so an hour later and a lot of talk about nothing, we learn that there is a villain who wants to destroy the world and the Power Rangers are the only ones who can stop her from doing so. Obviously. Then we have some failed Morphin and finally they suit up (with like 20 minutes left of the film). The action scenes were good but nothing special. The suits were kinda weird and the Red Ranger looked more like The Flash. I would say the thing that annoyed me most about this film was the dialogue. I can honestly say I think they spoke more about Krispy Kreme than being actual Power Rangers. Too much unnecessary build up and the action scenes at the end just weren't spectacular enough. Despite all the faults, I still found it to be watchable. I don't think it is really aimed at fans of the old shows/people wanting nostalgia. It is more about gaining a new set of fans and it wouldn't surprise me to see more films/shows following on from this one.",Power Rangers
83,MinistryofDoom,The Breakfast Club with Super Powers,4,29 June 2017,"The Jock, the Nerd, the Outcast, the New Girl, the Edgy Loner....stuck in detention hell for the rest of the year, forced to put up with each other and learn that they each are more than their stereotype, as the become more self-confident and joint together to become (cue fanfare)...THE POWER RANGERS. This film goes into great detail explaining each of the main characters and their person struggles, mostly about being misunderstood by their parents or society. However,....they coincidentally happen to be at the same location at the very same time on the very same day to discover that they were chosen to be the Power Rangers. How convenient.This film is 3/4th teen angst drama and 1/4th super hero action. While it goes to great lengths to explain each character's backstory, when the action superhero portion of the film starts, it fails to feel the urgency of the conflict that they are made to resolve. It doesn't explain who the villains are or where they came from or who the Power Rangers' mentor is for that matter. The most that we're given is a few blurbs here and there. The actual costumed Power Rangers in all their colorful glory do not even show up until very late in the film.In this regard, it feels like the Director isn't sure if his aim was to create a standalone superhero action film or a two hour segue into an inevitable Power Rangers sequel. While most of the performances are OK, Brian Cranston as the voice of Zordon and Elizabeth Banks as Rita Repulsa stand out. Banks in particular is every bit as crazy and demented as you'd expect Rita Repulsa to be. To be honest, I was skeptical when I heard that she was up for the role. The only performances I've seen of hers were in Judd Apatow- style comedies but rest assured than in Power Rangers, she really delivers.For those in doubt, this film definitely takes it's cues from the campy TV show of the 90s. There's a big emphasis on ""morphin' time"" and certain characters and references taken directly from the show indicate that the writers and director were definitely trying to woo the dedicated fans of this brand.In the end, it's not a bad movie. It just seems a little confused about what it wants to be and that confusion ultimately hurts this reboot.",Power Rangers
84,jephtha,A Surprisingly Encouraging Upgrade,7,8 July 2017,"For those that knew it as their first big franchise, Power Rangers will always hold some appeal. I happen to fall into this camp. Though a lapsed fan at best and fully aware of the series' constant dismissal of conventional critical standards, it brings a distinct, Saturday morning feeling that perhaps we'd all like to rekindle on occasion. With numerous old properties being re-launched, and often being botched, it really is about time this one got a shot at the modern age. The result is the first worthwhile adaptation of its type in a long time, and perhaps a little more.It's important to keep in mind that this film was made primarily for those at least passingly familiar with the series. I don't see it drawing in too many new, serious-minded followers; it won't serve as the crown-pleasing introduction that Star Trek (2009) was. But this should in no way denounce what the movie has accomplished. Admittedly, there are many bothersome things scattered throughout. I'm not a fan of Dean Isrealite's semi-hand-held camera-work and multiple plot elements don't add up, but these things don't significantly mar the proceedings. Compared to the stuff in the original series, this is a notable step in the right direction.In addition to providing recognizable new iterations of old faces, ""Power Rangers"" shows effort in bringing substance and dimension to its key players and a distinct visual flair for its fantastical elements. For a film tasked with establishing five key players, it does a commendable job of distinguishing each one, and the cast infuses them with more than enough humanity to keep us engaged; redefining them as misfits and screw-ups was an inspired decision. The story of how they become heroes is fraught with clichés and conventions of the superhero genre, but the good news is that this is one of the better applications of the formula. The team building segments are better than those from ""The Avengers"" or ""Guardians of the Galaxy"", possibly because the group is actively working towards a goal rather than just waiting around for the big push at the end. Simple actions like speedily passing notes during detention or sparring over the last café pastry add much.There seemed to be much fuss over the film's take on Rita. While Elizabeth Banks does go over-the-top in some scenes and there are multiple hints at a backstory that is never explored, the villainess serves her purpose adequately. She lacks substance, but she's intimidating and formidable, two qualities that the original version of the character badly needed. I was actually surprised by how much I enjoyed Bill Hader's take on Alpha 5. While the robot's new CGI look is not very appealing, has some genuinely funny lines, and even delivers some brief action. Bryan Cranston provides a suitably sullener take on Zordon, though his voice is a little too recognizable.Action is mostly limited to the final half-hour or so, which may understandably irk some viewers. The ground combat sequence with the Rangers taking on the golem-like putties includes a cool skirmish through a suspended lake, but leaves one wishing for more. Initially, I found the designs for the Zords to be off-putting, but I've gotten used to them, and actually found the scenes of them in action to be more enjoyable on repeat viewings. However, those machine-gun weapons are uninspired. As for the suits, they've got a nice alien quality, particularly from those galaxy-like displays and lights. Angel Grove provides an unusually small backdrop for the climax, but this was probably a conscious decision to avoid collateral damage based criticisms. Regardless, the sequel needs a bigger setting. That's where these types of characters can truly thrive.This is a time of franchise reboots and resurgences. While that's often not the best thing, it's always exciting to see the return of a beloved property. For the longest time, projects such as ""Digimon Adventure Tri"" seemed like an impossibility, and certainly no one expected another Power Rangers feature. This upgrade leaves me optimistic for once.",Power Rangers
85,autisticreviewers,Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.,5,23 March 2017,"For all those people that aren't aware this is a reboot of the Power Rangers. It has nothing to do the original ones. The Power Rangers have been around now for a long time and only 2 of their movies have made it to the big screen ""Mighty Morphin Rangers Movie"" and ""A Turbo Rangers Movie."" This is the third Power Rangers movie brought to the Screen. Also being a PG-13 Rated movie really says a lot. It's obvious to expect a bit more full on action and violence.First of all the acting was not that great. But that's not too surprising as the Power Rangers series and movies were never about great acting. Elizabeth Banks and the voices of Bill Hader and Bryan Cranston really did steal the entire show. While it didn't save the film they were definitely the highlights. The CGI was pretty bad. We both imagine that some scenes would look great in 3-D, a lot of it involving slow motion and car crashes. But the CGI was not really an update to the year 2017. it's obvious they were trying to also keep it like the good old Fox Kids days, but it it looked like it was trying to look good at the same time.If you really are looking to spend a weekend out with your family or grew up watching and loving the Power Rangers there is a chance you may feel like a good kid again, but all in all while the movie did have its moments of good it just really isn't worth seeing in the cinema. Maybe try renting it on Netflix when it's out. That's not to say other people will love it and enjoy it. We're sure others will adore this film, but for us it didn't quite hit the mark. The Autistic Reviewers give this 2/5 stars. 5/10. Check us out on facebook or Instagram. Jay And Nick- The Autistic Reviewers.",Power Rangers
86,afijamesy2k,Power rangers flounders badly with this mess.,2,23 March 2017,"You know when I was 12 years old, I saw power rangers, I thought the first 2 seasons (1993-95) represent splendid action, suspense and real characters, but once season 3 came it all went downhill and this movie is another example at how jumped the shark the power rangers franchise has become, the performances are awful, the story is completely and absolutely confusing, the screenplay is a mess and the editing is a trainwreck, now I love bryan Cranston he's always been a wonderful actor, but he is truly wasted in this one as zordon, a man who help 5 teens with their magical powers and their customs to save angel grove from monsters and the evil rita repulsa (played terribly by Elizabeth banks) and other nonsense, this is just a pathetic and useless attempt to revive the power rangers franchise, it is just awful, this is one of the year's worst films, no offense to my friend who is a power rangers fan, but this movie stinks.",Power Rangers
87,danielharden,It's Morphine Time,5,1 April 2017,"Based on Haim Saban's campy, B movie styled kids show, comes an attempt at a more realistic and darker (in colour) version of the Power Rangers. Directed by Dean Israelite and starring RJ Cyler, Bryan Cranston and Elizabeth Banks, this Power Rangers movie tries to be different and have substance, distancing itself from the campy fun of the original Rangers. But the end result is quite bland and cliché with few new aspects working.The best part of this film by far is RJ Cyler's performance as Billy, an autistic boy who lost his dad and who becomes the Blue Ranger. Following his brilliant role as Earl in Me and Earl and the Dying Girl, Cyler is yet again likable and funny but in a completely different way. Billy is the only ranger you particularly care for and I credit this to Cyler's great performance.While on this topic it's worth noting that the other ranger's don't act particularly badly, they just aren't given much to work with. Red Ranger Jason and Pink Ranger Kimberly are really bland characters and unfortunately they get the most screen time. These characters are nothing more than archetypal straight couple leads in many a film before this, and won't be remembered in any way after the credits role. Also Zack and Trini feel as if they are only there for the sake of numbers, they are given a bit of development but they are clearly ranger number 4 and 5.As well as their being good acting on display by RJ Cyler, there is also some below average acting in this film mainly by Elizabeth Banks. Elizabeth Banks plays antagonist Rita Repulsa in a rather over the top performance. Although being loyal to the source material by doing this, it does however go against the more grounded and realistic approach this film aimed for, and thus the conflict between whether the film should be more realistic or unrealistic begins.For the majority of this film it focuses on the bonding of the Rangers. This could have been done a lot better if the characters written were more compelling. This is also why I rate RJ Cyler's performance so highly, because he had to carry the majority of the film for me. The best scene in the film was the campfire scene as we actually get offered some substance, but unfortunately it trails off when it gets to our two boring leads. Zack, Trini and Billy are given a moment that allows the audience to engage with them whereas Jason and Kimberly remain boring by being tight lipped and this annoyed me.Once Morphed the film takes a nose dive, descending into a cheesy final act with some less than stellar visual effects. The visual effects didn't fit in with the real surroundings at all and made the film look fake and cheap. Also I have to mention the world's most subtle product placement that Krispy Kremes was given. If you aren't laughing right now then you clearly haven't seen the film. The product placement for Krispy Kremes is almost as bad as McDonald's in Mac and Me. There may not be a dance number in a Krispy Kreme, but Rita does take a break from the action to enjoy a good old donut.Overall, Power Ranger's is contradictory in what it wants to be. Director and studio obviously had different ideas, but in the end the studio won as evidenced by Krispy Kreme's role in the film. With a strong performance by RJ Cyler and no one else, the film struggled to keep me engaged even though attempts were made to make the film interesting. Now set up for a sequel as all blockbusters are nowadays and all I can say is, ""NO NO POWER RANGERS!""",Power Rangers
88,thepriceofpayne,I got the Power!,7,17 June 2018,"Power Rangers is already a tough film for me to review, see I grew up on the Power Rangers and have always been a HUGE fan. Thanks to Power Rangers I was introduced to many comic book characters, which in turn introduced me to comic book films, which in turn introduced me to Film in its own right, so I've got a lengthy history. Also when I say I grew up on Power Rangers, I didn't grow up on one particular incarnation, thanks to cousins and brothers who grew up in the 90s I had tapes and DVDs of almost every season of Power Rangers. One of my favorites being the original of course. So going into this film I had seen the entire original series as a kid as well as all of its other incarnations. That said this is a good film. To begin the Performances are fantastic the entire group of Rangers give some well rounded three dimensional characters even more depth, which brought me a lot of surprises. The film has since had me following the careers of Montgomery, Cyler, Scott, Gomez, and Lin and they've just continued to evolve as actors. Next the suit designs are great and the action/visuals are great as well. Thanks to a nice story and Israelites direction. However that doesn't excuse other moments. Bryan Cranston and Elizabeth Banks are fantastic actors, but Cranston is just given exposition lines and Banks is acting like she's in another film completely. Also the film didn't really mix the strong character moments well with the Power Rangers moments. It's like you need to watch the film as two halves not one whole. There are moments where the dialogue is off and the soundtrack (while good) distracts from the film, and it's very nice score. All in all the film has much more heart and love than the Ninja Turtles and Transformers films, but you can tell someone just wasn't too sure of the direction, and with the origin story it's harder to delve into greater moments. I personally love the film and hope it garners a sequel, but I can see why someone wouldn't like it that much. Especially some of the original fans, a die-hard ranger fan such as myself might like it more due to the many incarnations of Power Rangers, but for people who grew up on the Classic MMPR series, you may have a harder time. But if you look past nostalgia you'll find a fun Power Rangers film.",Power Rangers

I grew up watching the Power Rangers cartoons, so this movie is an upgrade for me.Of course the movie had flaws was not perfect, my detective eye detected some ""bad things"" here and there during the movie, but still I enjoyed every single second.Not to mention that Elizabeth Banks played the role of the villain Rita Repulsa, and played flawlessly.The actors were good, even if for me they were new, the acting wasnt bad at all, the story is pretty good, the villain was perfect, the figh scene with Goldar was very weak all screaming for nothing, but the huge power ranger compensate.",Power Rangers
90,samyoung-82648,Surprisingly enjoyable popcorn flick,7,31 March 2017,"I've been waiting a few years for Hollywood to introduce some diversity back into films. Female ninja warrior & CEO & scientist & hacker in 1: done to death. Idiot male cast : done to death. Black infallible hero : done to death. This movie is none of those.We've got a black computer nerd who is also autistic. Awesome! Progress. We've got female bullies. Awesome! Thought Hollywood banned them. We've got a reasonable male lead who is strong and not stupid. Progress!None of the characters is especially strong, they depend on each other. The females aren't arrogant, each of the characters feels sincere (except the female villain who is somewhat silly).If you're looking for a fun flick that avoids the usual sexist politics, go see this movie. It won't win any awards and it will be forgotten in 2 years. However, they shook off the usual stereotype you've seen in the last 50 blockbusters.Well done to everybody who made this movie. It was radical (ie. avoiding sexist stereotypes). I'm glad someone had the courage.Highly recommended.",Power Rangers
91,vasco_cid,How to fully satisfy a fan 101.,10,24 March 2017,"High on the heels of frantic superhero revivals of past, Lionsgate acquired another niche property of the 90's in hopes of launching another multi-million dollar franchise. Luckily enough for me, being a long time hardcore fan, Power Rangers was the chosen product. I realise the cynicism of my over excitement for this film and my overwhelming praise for it, being a detractor of the Marvel cinematic universe, but subjectivism and personal nostalgia end up playing a big part in relating to these films, so... tough luck.Power Rangers is not and was never a franchise for everyone. Its sole selling point was a very childish one, that you either related to or not. The story lines and plots were recycled, thin and repetitive and it's very cheesy and campy nature was never shed under a rug; it was always thrown directly into our faces. Nevertheless, the ""narrative"" potential of the series was hinted on some occasions and was only sporadically developed either because budget constraints held it back or because it never HAD to.What Dean Israelite did here was nevertheless smart, sensible and necessary: adapting the property into the 21st century, focusing and developing characters (that were never), taking creating liberties that were harmless and present us a full-fledged nostalgia punch, armed with heart, humour and excitement. The same as the original series, the film knows it's cheesy. It knows the premise is far-fetched. But the source material asks that of you; and the reason why we escape to movies (these genre specifically) is not to find some way to fit the story into our world. It is to find escapism, fun and entertainment - and this Power Rangers (film) delivers just that and then some. Power Rangers is not a perfect film. It will not please everyone, it will (sadly) not gross obscene amounts of money to launch the very optimistic plans for multiple sequels; but today I woke up with a wide grin knowing that this property was adapted and honoured so well despite its shortcomings, so sensibly to its publicised characters backgrounds and, most importantly, so respectfully to its legacy and fanbase.",Power Rangers
92,joshbarton15,It's poor but it made me feel like a kid in the 90s again,6,26 March 2017,"With the major box-office success of something like the Transformers franchise, I'm surprised that it's taken until 2017 to reboot the Power Rangers franchise for a modern audience. An avid viewer of the original television series back in the 90s, there was no way I was going to miss their first big screen appearance in twenty years.When a group of high-school kids; Jason (Dacre Montgomery), Kimberly (Naomi Scott), Billy (RJ Cyler), Trini (Becky G) and Zack (Ludi Lin), uncover an ancient spaceship, they discover the power coins they stumbled upon have given them superpowers. Meeting Zordon (Bryan Cranston), via his consciousness that has been uploaded to the ship, they learn that they must harness their new abilities and become the Power Rangers, before the evil Rita Repulsa (Elizabeth Banks) destroys all life on Earth.There is no denying that Power Rangers is cinematic trash and the film's biggest flaw is that it doesn't fully embrace the fact that is what it is, leading to the film becoming a complete and utter tonal mess, unable to decide whether it wants to be an edgy superhero film full of teen angst or an all out cheesy superhero film. In the end it chooses to be both and the film really does suffer because of it.This is Power Rangers for crying out loud so I expect the over-the-top cheesy finale that unfolds once they morph for the first time however, when this finale comes after ninety minutes of semi- serious build up, it just doesn't fit together at all. That's another problem this film has; it's way too long, clocking in at just over two hours.The semi-serious side is weighed down by backstories of these misfits who meet while attending Saturday detention but The Breakfast Club this is not. There is way too much baggage attached to these characters, including Billy's autism which was in danger of becoming a gimmick. It's commendable to include such a thing, as well as one of the characters being gay however, there's no need to make such a song and dance about it.There is fun to be had with Power Rangers mind. From the moment they fully become the Power Rangers right through until the end I felt like a 90s kid again sat in front of the television on a Saturday morning. I did find the build up to all of that tolerable it's just I wish they'd have settled on making the rest of the film as batshit crazy as its final act.There isn't really much that can be said about the acting in this film other than the five playing the Power Rangers aren't all that bad and Elizabeth Banks has an absolute ball hamming it up as Rita Repulsa, a villain who has nothing about her except being pure evil, which makes a change for once.Power Rangers didn't disappoint me at all because I wasn't expecting it to be anything but a poor film. My suggestion would be to switch off all brain cells, get the biggest tub of popcorn and just let the insanity take over.",Power Rangers
93,barbagvido,It tries to take itself seriously then goes a completely silly route,5,27 April 2017,"Power Rangers is a sort of anticipated movie based on the popular kids show all 90s kids grew up with. I wouldn't really call myself a 90s kid since I was born at the end of the 90s, but I did watch some of the show as a kid. And while it wasn't a crucial part of my childhood, I remember watching it occasionally, so I was interesting in how this would turn out. And I'm not sure what I think about it.It tries to balance the light silly tone and the dark, more grounded approach. Does it manage? Nope. It tries to take itself seriously (while some really, really, REALLY cringy jokes are thrown into the mix) and then it goes full ""Screw it, this is based on a kids show!"" mode. And it just doesn't go well together. It's like they couldn't decide what movie they wanted to make. The acting has isn't very good either. Some actors tried, bit still didn't really stand out. But one bad performance stands out and that's Elizabeth Banks. I usually like her as an actress, but she was so over the top here that I sort of loved it. You can see she's having fun in this role and you are having fun watching her. She's definitely the most memorable part of the movie. And she's not the only unintentional laugh here. The whole movie is full of those (or sometimes just cringes). Especially if you're a bit dirty minded, a lot of lines will sound so, so wrong. But what lifts this movie up is that its fun, the actors have a lot of chemistry even though the acting is not much and the whole team and their relationship is very well established and it's probably the strongest point of the movie.Overall, I guess it's passable, it's fun. But I really don't know by what kind of standards and expectations one should watch the movie because of the tone issues.",Power Rangers
94,Minus_The_Beer,Ranger Things,6,31 March 2018,"With the seemingly endless popularity of superheroes, robots, dinosaurs and gigantic monsters on the big screen, it was only a matter of time before a franchise where superheroes transform into gigantic robotic dinosaurs to battle gigantic monsters would be resurrected. That's right: everyone's favorite half-hour toy commercial from the '90s is back to kick nostalgic butt! The ""Power Rangers"" have been re-booted with a slickly made, big-budget popcorn flick that wants to remind you of your care-free childhood days spent in front of the TV. It also probably wants you to forget the atrocious 1995 film.
It almost works.
With a gang of fresh young faces in place, the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers get back into action, sans the clumsy Mighty Morphin title. Also missing in action is a great deal of the trademark humor and inherent corniness that made the original series so much fun to watch, even long after most of us had grown up and out of it. In place of these elements are a stronger focus on character and backstory, as we not only get to know more about the teen titans, but also about their allies and enemies. Yep, even the Rangers' big-headed mentor Zordon and his haywire sidekick Alpha (played by Bryan Cranston and Bill Hader respectively) get some time to shine, as we learn more about how they came into contact with the power of the Rangers. Likewise, villainess Rita Repulsa (Elizabeth Banks) is given ample time to roam and wreak havoc, as she murders her way across town in search of gold, all the while jamming some Social Distortion. We're a long way from after-school Fox TV, friends.
The kids all play variations of the characters we came to recognize in the original run. Here we have Jason/The Red Ranger, the natural leader and jock with a heart of gold, as played by Dacre Montgomery. Stealing nearly every scene is RJ Cyler as Billy/The Blue Ranger, a brainiac who proudly confesses to being on the spectrum. Naomi Scott steps into the role of Kimberly/The Pink Ranger. This version of Kimberly is a rebel and a frequent target of bullies (haters gon' hate). Rounding out the crew are Becky G as Trini/The Yellow Ranger and Ludi Lin as Zack/The Black Ranger. These characters feel slightly under-cooked in comparison to the three ""leads."" Trini and Zack both appear troubled and withdrawn, proud conformists who are tough as nails. A glimpse into their respective home lives gives each character a little more dimension. Together, the five teens must learn to work together if they are to stop Rita's plan to end all human life. In spite of the film's short-comings, all five actors are on point and keep things are lively as possible, even when the script fails them.
Most folks are going to come into a film like this expecting a super smash of monster on robot action, and although the back half of the film makes good on that promise, the hour and a half (!) that leads up to it might leave some viewers (especially the younger ones) a bit cold. While the increased focus on character is more than welcome (given how shallow the original series was), it gets a bit redundant a third of the way in. The new characters are established firmly from the start, but the story doesn't quite know how to advance from there, leaving the middle piece of the film a little laggy and repetitive. A lot of the story beats we've seen from other (and better) superhero films are repeated and to be quite honest, it gets hard not to tune out. When the slam-bang finale comes crashing down, it (mostly) quenches the thirst for big, goofy fun but not quite. The end result is a film that feels a little muddled, as if the committee that pieced it together didn't quite know what target audience they were trying to reach. Not as dumb as ""Transformers"" but not as fun as, say, ""Guardians of the Galaxy,"" ""Power Rangers"" straddles the middle a little too comfortably. Or maybe these characters and their accompanying concepts work better in smaller doses. There's still some fun to be had here, make no mistake, but more often than not, it feels like these Rangers are operating with slightly diminished power.",Power Rangers

96,reddragonhero17,The Power is on!,9,25 April 2017,"I got my wish to see this movie yesterday since I was an on-off fan of Power Rangers (Zyuranger, In Space, Lightspeed Rescue, and Megaforce), and boy did it not disappoint! I actually felt for the characters since they had a lot of depth to them as teenagers with social problems. Jason who made the mistake with the Bull, Kimberly for bullying, Billy with his autism, Trini's identity problem, and Zack's Bravado, all had their moment to redeem themselves. Alpha is WAY more pleasing than his TV counterpart, and Zordon (played by Bryan Cranston who played the monsters Snizzard and Twinman from the series) is more interesting as a holographic head than a floating head in a tube. Elizabeth Banks is a deliciously evil Rita Repulsa (looks kind of like Divatox from Turbo, but no matter). The story has some depth and direction with coherence compared to the childish first two movies. You don't get the real action until much later, but when it starts id doesn't let up! Even better is they play the movie theme from the first movie; good move it really gets you pumped for excitement. Glad Jason got his cool Power Sword, but the Megazord is way cooler than Michael Bay's Optimus Prime and the final battle against Goldar is outstanding.

97,moviemattb,A Morphinominal Experience,10,27 March 2017,"It has been three years, since this was first announced as Lionsgate and Saban teamed up to do reboot of ""Power Rangers,"" and now it is finally here for the time in 2017. This movie came out on my Birthday, and got to see it the day after it came out, and all I got to say that ""Power Rangers"" was a morphinominal experience. I had such a fun time with this movie, and really had the pleasure to see a ""Power Rangers"" movie on the big screen like I never had before. I will not spoil this movie for you, because I want you to be surprised by it. Pressing on, the movie tells our five teenagers with attitude as they all come from different backgrounds, when they stumbled across as they found these power coins that gives them their own strengths and found a spaceship as they meet their mentor Zordon and his robotic assistant Alpha 5 as they are chosen to become Power Rangers. While that's going on, we have Rita Repulsa as she has come to Angel Grove to wipe out humanity as our five main heroes must come together as a team in order to save the world. It may be your typical origin story like you have seen a million times before, but it works on its own level. With that said, this is a darn good looking movie, and this does not look like a Michael Bay movie. This is definitely Dean Israelite's movie, the director that brought us ""Project Almanac"" which I really enjoyed that movie, and he really does care on making this movie as he knows how the fan-base really loves ""Power Rangers"" and never acting as a director that really wants a paycheck. I give him huge props for putting a lot care into making this movie, and his direction is absolutely wonderful. The way the movie opens, which I can't spoiled has made my jaw dropped and it was an incredible way to open. The movie's tone is dark, but it still retains the essence of ""Power Rangers,"" where it never forgets the cheese factors. This movie is like a cross between ""Chronicle"" meets ""The Breakfast Club."" I really do love the look of the movie as it is beautifully well filmed, and really has that the kind of atmosphere as it does look gritty, but still has the colors. Brian Tyler's music is epic, and I loved that kind of vibe as it really sounds very sci-fi, but for a coming of age superhero movie. You do hear, the ""Power Rangers"" theme song which it does make it a treat for fans that grew up with the series. The cast in this movie are just fantastic. Bryan Cranston as Zordon is really remarkable as he embodies the character as not only he plays as a wise mentor, but very complex as he is trying to get our heroes to become Power Rangers. Bill Hader as Alpha is really funny, and enjoyable to watch. I do enjoy the redesign of this character as he looks more like an alien robot, instead of some actor in a suit. No disrespect on the original Alpha, just like to point that out. Elizabeth Banks as Rita Repulsa is really funny, but quite menacing at the same time. This Rita does a whole lot more, than just sitting at her palace doing nothing and she really does fight the Rangers. As for our heroes, Dacre Montgomery, Naomi Scott, Ludi Lin, Becky Gomez, and R.J. Cyler have all done such a superb job to have great chemistry together as their acting is very natural and they all do have a charisma. They played flawed teenagers, as they go through real life issues instead of just being goodie goods from the show. They really are the Power Rangers for this generation. I am very pleased for this movie to go deeper into the mythology of Power Rangers as opposed to what the show couldn't do. The action in this movie is pretty good, and so does the special effects. The pacing is never slow, and really does keep me invested with the story, and as well with its characters. The humor, thankfully, doesn't have any of the burp or fart jokes like what happened to the recent ""TMNT"" movies. This has the right kind of humor like what Marvel Cinematic Universe movies have, and it knows when to have fun. I did cry during that one moment in the movie, but once again, cannot spoil it for you. Can't forget about the Zords and the suits as they look really cool in motion. Love them very much. Any flaws? Yes, but they are minored. As much as there was character development for the Rangers, but we kept getting more from Jason, Kimberly and Billy. Sure Zack and Trini do have moments to shine, but you wish there was more to them. Nevertheless, there was enough to care about them. As for Goldar, I thought the design of him looks interesting, and can see why they went with it as it fits within the context of the movie, but you wish he had more of a personality instead of being a run of the mill monster. Sure he is intimidating, but really wanted more from him. So I find this Goldar both good and bad at the same time. I really love this movie, and really do enjoy the aspects of teamwork as it does add to the heart of the movie. ""Power Rangers"" is a loving tribute to the series, and you are going to have a wonderful time at the movies as it appeals to the old and new generation of fans. Kids can enjoy it, and so can adults. This was the best Birthday that I've ever had, and I am giving ""Power Rangers"" a 10 out of 10.",Power Rangers

99,Brevin_Campbell,"It not great, but it works",7,29 March 2017,"I have been very worried about Power Rangers ever since the press release came out. While I was looking forward to it I wasn't sure how dark or cheesy it would be. But what I didn't expect was it to be a little bit of both. The Power Rangers movie is a cool and fun with its plot and has a lot diversity in its cast. Everyone here seems to be having a good time in some way. The film doesn't have many big name stars in it and yet still finds away to be successful. Why Power Rangers hasn't been the critical hit that critics wanted and the box off juggernaut the studio needed it still was fun and that is all you can really ask for with these types of films. If I were to give a negative it would be Rita Repulsa. She seems to be in a different movie entirely as while all the other actors feel a bit grounded her character feels completely over the top to the point where it is almost laughable. She simply doesn't seem to have the charisma and the groundedness to fit in this slightly darker world they have built.That not to say Power Rangers itself is really that dark. It has many darker elements within it and it does go further than the show, but I would say its about as dark as Hunger Games of Divergent. The film feels very much like a teen film made for the same demographics that went to see Twilight, Hunger Games and others. But unlike those films it not afraid to have a little bit of fun with itself. Overall Power Rangers is a film I would highly recommend people to check out.",Power Rangers

This Power Rangers movie however had everything Power Rangers has, except of course Goldar was a giant metamorphosis of gold without that wolf like face. lol. Also Rita Repulsa is way more evil in this then she is in the actual show, since she was just a character swiped from an old Japanese show. lol. Also the Blue Ranger is my favorite. Always has been and always will be. The Megazord in this was wickedly awesome too. We also get to see a cameo of Kimberly and Tommy from the original series. This film had a great cast too. Bryan Cranston as Zordon even. I also like Alpha 5 in this better then him in the old show, cause the old Alpha is kind of dorky. Also Elizabeth Banks was fantastic as Rita Repulsa. It's also nice to see Zordon having a backstory of when he was a Power Ranger. I also know there's gonna be a sequel to this cause we all saw Tommy's jacket at the end. Also the Putties were more intimidating in this then they were in the original show. Yep this movie has everything the Power Rangers should have.

103,byson5186,"Entertaining, But Prefer Original Effects",6,27 March 2017,"A lot of T.V. shows Millennials grew up with as kids, are getting made into PG-13 movies with 21st Century CGI, and Power Rangers is no exception. This movie was entertaining, but it also felt pretty cliché. The action felt like nothing we haven't seen from other movies like Transformers or Avengers with the CGI we have nowadays.To start off with the Rangers cast, I'm sure all of us can agree they weren't as good as the original 6 Power Rangers including Tommy, when the show first started. I'm amazed years later that they could have such a good cast of the original Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. Even if they weren't the best at acting they were perfect for their parts of the characters they played. Naomi Scott doesn't even come close to how awesome Amy Jo Johnson was as Kimberly. Amy Jo Johnson is immediately still recognizable as Kimberly over 20-years later.Another thing about the characters, is even in the trailer, I've seen people compare this movie to The Breakfast Club with characters in High School getting in trouble and having Saturday detention. In the original series, the characters were good friends hanging out throughout the series. They were good kids and present themselves as role models for a kids show. In this movie, they were more like rebellious kids, especially Jason. The movie could have at least included Bulk and Skull in detention as Bulk and Skull were a main part of the original series, and always in detention.I also ought to mention that in Mighty Morphin, the characters were martial artists and gymnasts. It was cool to see martial arts in the show, and martial arts fights. Most of the episodes had unmorphed fights with the putties where we didn't see their super strength, but natural abilities. I ought to say the putty fight in episode 3, ""Teamwork"" where Trini and Kimberly were fighting putties at the dumpsite was amazing and the hitting was on sync with the music on that scene. You hear the beating sounds at the proper time when there is hitting. That small scene from the one of the first ever episodes of Power Rangers, has in my opinion more entertaining action than the action in this movie.The zords in this movie felt like what we'd see in a Transformers movie. In Mighty Morphin the dinozords were easily distinguishable. We saw them get called in most of the episodes and saw them come out from their hiding places, the Mastodon coming out of the Arctic, shooting cold blasts. The Pterodactyl coming out of a volcano. Sabertooth Tiger running really fast and jumping over a bush. In the movie the zords just felt like something they could each command with no individuality, and I thought seemed less realistic as CGI than how they filmed them in the original series.Rita on the other hand seemed better on this movie than the T.V. show. In the show she mostly resides on Moon Palace trying to come up with a diabolical plan to take over. In this movie, she was truly presented as an evil character. I feel like this Rita could kill the Power Rangers way more easily than Rita from the original series. So yeah, I'd say Rita was the one thing the movie did better than the show.The putties weren't as good. Not like stuntmen from the show where we again see actual martial arts without the super powers in action. I prefer the original effects as I think they seem more realistic especially movement. These CGI effects are cool, but mostly feel like something you'd see on a computer with fast movement that doesn't look as realistic as when the zords and Power Rangers morphed, are men in costumes. I've mostly complained and compared this to the series. It was still entertaining. I liked the scene where the characters get to know each others, which felt reminiscent to a scene in Breakfast Club. I also like the scene where they jump in the water and we see what's below it!! That scene was cool!! But, overall while an entertaining movie, it feels a little cliché to what we're used to seeing in cinema nowadays. I think the biggest flaw in the movie was not having martial arts like the show. But, it is still an entertaining movie I'm sure you'll find interesting. I'll give it a 6/10.",Power Rangers
104,drawlife,"Has an identity crisis, but sporadically enjoyable.",6,24 March 2017,"When I heard this movie was being made, I was optimistic and cautious. While following the hype train, I was happy to see that the film was being taken seriously. The only aspect I really disliked from all the announcements that were being made were the Power Ranger outfits themselves. Aside from that, everything else was pretty much on point. Power Rangers isn't the disaster I was hoping it wasn't going to be. For the original fans out there, this movie just was not going to work with that campy tone similar to the television series. It worked for what it was as a television show for children such as myself back in the day. That just wasn't going to translate well on the big screen, lets not kid ourselves. Plus the previous Power Ranger films that came out in the 90's weren't met with acclaim or did big numbers at the box office. The film's main problem is that it has an identity crisis, trying to be serious teen drama to an adventure filled sci-fi action film. Moments work here and there, sporadically. RJ Cyler is the bright spot as Billy the Blue Ranger. He's the only one that really gives the group of teens a lot flare, and his autistic side is portrayed with respect. Dacre Montgomery, Naomi Scott, Ludi Lin, and Becky G are all given something to do. Montgomery's Jason is the once promising athlete turned screw-up and the team's leader. He almost finds redemption in the film given his responsibilities as the Red Ranger. Scott's Kimberly finds a new home when she's kicked out of her own click in school. Lin's Zack is an outcast who acts tough, but that's just to hide his fears and insecurities. Becky G's Trini is also an outcast loner who comes to accept herself, her coming out is handled with care and treated with respect like Billy's autism. The cast actually is not too bad either and for the most part deliver with their performances. The film tries to give them all layers and it can be engaging, even if it is a Breakfast Club ripoff.Bryan Cranston and Bill Hader are great. Even as a child, I've hated Alpha-5 since the original show premiered and here he's a little less annoying thanks to Hader's performance. Cranston's Zordon has more to do that tell the Rangers who their up against. He's got personality and also has ulterior motives. The weak link is Elizabeth Banks as Rita. She looks like she's having fun and cutting it loose to portray her, but she doesn't do much outside of conquering the world like all typical villains do. We don't really learn anything about her and why she's doing what she's doing. More screen time to develop her would have been nice. At best the film plays out like an episode of any DC/Marvel superhero show on the CW or abc. The origin story is exactly what anyone would expect in an origin story. It can be tiring to sit through as the familiar tropes are extremely apparent and can get boring from time to time. Once it goes into high gear it gets fun. This is where the identity crisis also comes in play as it becomes a CGI, over the top action feast for 15-20 minutes. Despite it being fun to watch, it really never felt completely earned, the story never really positioned itself to actually feel earned. Also bare in mind there is a lot of Krispy Kreme promotion in the film. I've never seen a movie put that much promotion and devotion at all to any product. Being a former Power Ranger die-hard, I cannot watch a single frame of any Power Ranger episodes at all, they're all so terrible, but the nostalgia always stays. For a reimagining/homage it's a step towards the right direction. But it's also a jumbled mess. Should there be a sequel, I would hope it figures out what it wants to be. Also redesign the damn outfits they're an eyesore. Less is more. All in all I'm happy that the filmmakers took the property seriously and I'm open to see what's next. 6.8/10",Power Rangers
105,mjplysaght,"Has pacing issues, but overall a good take on the cheesy 90s show",7,5 January 2018,"Fun fact: the original Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers TV series first aired the day after I was born, according to Wikipedia (This was August 1993, although they probably started airing it in Ireland a good bit after). Nonetheless, I saw bits and pieces of Power Rangers throughout my childhood. The original series was very much of its time: incredibly cheesy and definitely appealed to kids.Obviously I grew out of it as time went on, with the numerous iterations of the series that followed. They were obviously doing something right because after nearly 25 years, the franchise seems to still be going strong.And then it was announced a few years ago that they were doing a film reboot with a more serious edge. I initially batted it off but then I learnt Bryan Cranston was going to play Zordon. When I saw the trailer, I laughed so hard when I saw Cranston's CG face as the character.I didn't go out of my way to see this film. In all honesty, I caught it on Netflix on an idle day during the Christmas break. My initial expectations would be that they were going for a run-of-the-mill Michael Bay style action movie. While there are elements of this, there were other parts of the film that actually caught my attention.My rough analysis is that it's basically if they mixed The Breakfast Club with a superhero movie. A lot of time is dedicated to the character development of the five heroes. Each of them is from their respective 'social stereotype' but they've added a few twists to be more progressive. Jason (Red Ranger) is the star football player put under house arrest after a prank went horribly wrong, Kimberly (Pink Ranger) is a popular girl, haunted by her actions of cyberbullying, Zack (Black Ranger) is an outlandish teen of Asian descent who secretly cares for his sick mother, Trini (Yellow Ranger) is a Latina closet lesbian struggling to come to terms with her identity, dealing with her overbearing family, and my absolute favourite of them all, Billy (Blue Ranger) an African-American autistic boy who is loyal to his friends.Rita Repulsa (played very hammily by Elizabeth Banks) is the villain of the piece, hoping to restore her power from the prehistoric war fought on Earth in the prologue. A former Power Ranger, she goes rogue and vows complete domination.It's then a pretty formulaic sequence of events where the Rangers need to put aside their differences and team up against Rita. It takes a while for the action to finally kick off but the character development is done very well. As I mentioned earlier, Billy is my favourite character because the mannerisms of autism are portrayed spot-on. As a lifelong advocate for awareness on autism and Aspergers, I have deep respect for RJ Cyler who portrayed Billy.The flow of the movie is fairly predictable but I appreciated what they brought to the table, being as inclusive as they could, with a multi-ethnic ensemble of Rangers, with social issues such as autism and LGBT stigma.This film was overlooked by a lot of people but I'm quite fond of it.",Power Rangers

Five Teenagers become Super Heroes and fight a Giant Monster while riding in a Humanoid Giant Robot, which is made up of Five Smaller, usually animal themed, Robots. That's Power Rangers. It's cheesy. It's campy. It's nostalgic fun.
This movie is banking on you being familiar with the franchise.
(Pros: )
I liked the teenagers. Their acting was pretty good. Trini was quite underdeveloped though. I liked that Rita was the Green Ranger, and Zordon was the Red Ranger. It makes sense that Rita COULD kill everyone. The original Green Ranger was always the Strongest/Best Ranger. In the 90s TV show, the Green Ranger leaps into the Megazord and kicks all the other Rangers out of it.

The zords and ranger suits are hideous. I do not see those toys selling well at all. They look like Transformers meets Iron Man.",Power Rangers
108,mickdansforth,This movie gives us Breakfast Club instead of Saved By The Bell,10,12 June 2017,"I was a young adult by the time Power Rangers started broadcasting on Fox. I enjoyed the Toei footage that Saban interwove with their newly shot footage for the show. By the Saved-By-The-Bell type footage of the American kids in Power Rangers made the show unwatchable to me. In the 00's, after buying Godzilla vs Megaguirus from Hong Kong on Ebay, I started buying Hong Kong DVDs of Ultraman, Masked Rider and eventually, semi-reluctantly some of the Super Sentai shows. And I found the Super Sentai shows, minus any US shot footage, to be really great. Absolutely nothing I heard or saw about this movie before seeing it appealed to me in any way. I don't trust Saban as a creative force, and none of the gritty reboot talk, or reveals appealed to me in any way. And Bryan Cranston in blockbusters is usually him cashing a big check for as little screen time as possible, and I have no idea if he was actually on set with his costars or not, but if he was not, you can't tell from the performances because the ""teens"" sell it. But once we start meeting the kids, I found them and their stories very compelling. It quickly became obvious that instead of retreading Save By The Bell of the teen drama, they were using The Breakfast Club as source material. And it works. This movie makes you care about these kids and their struggles. The exploration of their power is fun, and the all out action is great, if short, but the heart of this movie is the team learning to love themselves and each other and how to work together as a team. David Denman from Traffic Light (who was also Skip on Angel) was great as the Red Ranger's father. They used him a lot and he played his part well. Erica Cerra from Eureka has one short scene as the Yellow Ranger's mom, where the camera never rests on her long enough to recognize her, but she did her part great. Elizabeth Banks is awesome per usual and Bill Hader doesn't ruin anything. I hope this movie pulls in enough money to warrant a sequel because I definitely want to see more.",Power Rangers
109,liam_nb,A solid watch,7,7 April 2020,"If your expectations are low you'll probably enjoy this movie as a standard action flick with decent characterization but if I took a deep dive into why i think it doesn't live up to the Power Rangers name it would of course be the fact it tried to be way too dark in some parts and Elizabeth Banks terrible villain also the cuttaway everytime she does something I know why they did it but at the same time it's a practice in movies I hate, basically this movie tried to modernize power rangers and do a marvel approach to it it still had some of that classic ridiculousness but not enough to get a 10/10 so if your a fan if say your more likely to hate this if you've never seen power rangers this will probably be alright for you.

110,Oberrated,"Good fun entertainment, flaws can not be unseen though.",7,25 March 2017,"I was hyped to see this movie. My childhood was going to be relived with this new take on the original series and to be honest, I was pretty satisfied with what I saw by the time the movie came to an end. Characters I loved in new form, a dope new style of armor (which has been hotly debated but how is that a turning point for a movie being bad or not? P*** off), and quite an entertaining bit of material throughout the film in regards to comedy and action. So no doubt, 'Power Rangers' was an entertaining film from my perspective. However, everything was not all rainbows and butterflies. The story progression was sporadic throughout the film. I felt as if the film had a hard time balancing the whole serious tone and the imminent Earth's destruction between the OhEmGee teen drama that was supposed to instill a deep emotional heart-string pluck (although I did feel for Zack (Ludi Lin) the Black Ranger because I'm a mommas boy). Let us also not forget the music video film constantly blaring out mainstream tunes at inopportune moments. Sorry, the last thing I want to listen to is Kanye West's ""Power"" while an intense battle scene is going on.So beyond all that and other personal gripes I had with the film, I do want to bring focus to the characters. I had no previous knowledge of any of the actors and actresses besides Becky G (Trini/Yellow Ranger) being a musician and me loving RJ Cyler (Billy/Blue Ranger) in the film 'Me, Earl, and the Dying Girl'. RJ Cyler easily stole the show. From the moment he entered the screen, I loved every moment of his screen time... Discount Zac Efron aka Dacre Montgomery (Jason/Red Ranger) was a solid player in the film. I was not entirely thrilled with his role of the leader but I hope to see better from him with the expected coming sequels... Naomi Scott and Ludi Lin (Kimberly/Pink Ranger and Zack/Yellow Ranger) were average for me. I was not a fan of Kimberly's story and Zack was a bit of annoyance but they were nothing perspective altering for me... Lastly, Elizabeth Banks as Rita Repulsa was actually impressive for me. I enjoyed her quirky persona and was actually shocked by the way they presented her at times through almost a horror type way. Very cool for me...

They always forget that the audience has to be invested and to care on everything that is happening, so that it can be successful and everyone be excited for future installments, but every studio doesn't care at all. The only thing that they care is making money and art doesn't bring them that and that's why we get bland, boring, messy and broken products that are disguised as films.Saban's Power Rangers is just a bad film with many aspects that just don't work or having things that we've seen a thousand time before. I watched Power Rangers many times as a kid (DinoThunder, Mystic Force and Operation Overdrive) and while the TV franchise that the 2017 reboot is based on is very corny and cheesy, the film still had potential and opportunities to evolve into something special and different, but i didn't expect to become a very uninteresting and generic superhero film.",Power Rangers
112,seige-hound,A Decent and Fun Action Film,6,28 March 2017,"I liked watching Power Rangers. It was a good time, but I feel that the actual 'Power Rangers' part of Power Rangers was a missed opportunity. Let me explain.So, the film is about five teenagers (17-18 years-ish) who all have their personality quirks. Jason is a jock who gets busted for stealing a cow(?) and is under house arrest. Billy is an autistic guy with a knack for explosives. Kimberley is a mean girl cheerleader who was disowned by her friend group. Zach is a guy who skips school and is overly outgoing to compensate for the dread of possibly losing his sick mother. And Trini is a weirdo outcast who is implied to be a closeted lesbian.So we got this ragtag group of kids, all pretty likable with room to develop further, and they discover an alien spacecraft buried under hundreds of metres of rock, and five coloured 'coins' that give them superpowers.And for the first hour and a half or so, we get a pretty neat 'Chronicle meets Breakfast Club' high school drama going on. We get Bryan Cranston as Zordon, the spirit of a past Power Ranger, some robot thingy, and the villain Rita Repulsa, an ex-ranger who is hellbent on destroying the world, as per usual.Rita is pretty good, if a bit cheesy. She isn't quite as over the top as the original Rita from the show (at least from what I've seen) but she's in a similar vein, albeit a bit darker in tone. She's still crazy in a cheesy sort of way, but she is much more violent, and she is shown killing innocent people to get their gold tooth fillings (she's collecting gold to build a giant creature called Goldar, who is made of gold. Just go with it) I think that even through the cheese, she came across as a formidable foe for the teenagers.My main issue with this film, and the reason I rated it a 6/10 instead of higher, is that the climax is severely underwhelming. When the rangers finally morph into their suits, they look cool, but the action itself is boring. There are three major fight sequences in a 2 hour action film. One without their costumes, one in, and one with them riding the Zords, the latter one being the largest. I'm familiar enough with the show to know that this is pretty much how an episode is formatted, but the balance of action is a bit off for the average movie-going person.Now the character development is pretty solid, and I'll give them credit for actually developing the characters instead of assuming the viewer knows enough about the show to fill in the gaps. But I think they should have tried to strike a better balance between character and action. I'm not sure how they would be able to do that for this film, but my feelings remain the same.It is a good film, don't get me wrong. It's not an amazing film, but it's good, and I hope that they consider making a sequel with more, better action.",Power Rangers
113,TheMovonka,I want to be the red ranger...,6,29 March 2017,"...words I haven't said since I was 8 or 9 years old, but what a surprisingly good reboot of the Power Rangers reminded me of. In times of reboots and remakes, the classic 90ies TV series about clumsy Kung Fu fighters in spandex suits earns its screen time too to show us the modern newbie rangers challenging Rita Repulsa under the support of Alpha and Zordon, played by Brian Cranston.When 5 young problematic teenagers come together like the breakfast club, easy storytelling and old fashioned individual issues with friendship, gossip and being different bind people to become friends and a team. When they discover 65 million year old stones that chose the kids to be the new Power Rangers, the world has to be saved by them.So far, so uninspired. But the good thing is that the movie knows that. Taking it not too seriously, the characters are more likable than maybe assumed by the trailers and entertainment sets in very soon. Not that we see a good movie here in terms of high class film making, but we see an entertaining, definitely funny kids action movie also reaching out to us 90ies fans smiling at the moment dinosaur robots fight to ""Go Go Power Rangers""-music.For all out there who were like me, thinking this cannot be good and will be a Dragonball Evolution disaster, it is not. Nobody is as surprised as me, but it reaches more Tennage Mutant Ninja Turtles reboot level and so I am fine with more movies here to come.

116,DBLurker,Another politically correct Hollywood garbage..,1,29 June 2017,"Instead of creating any new unique characters, they went for same old PC garbage with generic character templates. Not a single interesting Power Ranger but I guess for Hollywood, being ""lesbian"" or gay these days is interesting enough. The actors are god-awful, especially the Chinese guy.The fact is, we used to watch the show as kids because of creatures and fighting, not because of generic Power Rangers (PRs) as normal humans since they had a personality of a potato. You'd think that a movie focusing so much on normal PRs would come up with better characters than generic troubled teens with autism and lesbianism as their special power (when no in suits).The worse part is that the action is so.. boring. The creatures they fight are so awful that most of the time you don't even care that the creatures exist (funny enough, creatures have same level of personality as the PRs). Then there is the terrible Goldan special effect and hilariously awful Rita. In shows, Rita was just crazy fun, overacted and funny. Here? She's trying to be serious and all sinister and it's just so cringe-worthy seeing the actress trying to act that way.Coming back to special effects. They are just terrible. Robots look like they are made of plastic, Goldan looks like terrible pre-rendered CGI from those old PS2 CGI before the games. Everything looks so fake and considering how fake the PRs shows looked, this is just amazing. At least in shows you can suspend disbelief knowing the limitation of a budget.. here? They spent $100 million dollars on this garbage CGI with robots that look like plastic toys.Anyway, there is going to be a sequel apparently.

The problem with this movie is that the action scenes have very little screen time and gives more room for character development and also the zord fights have more screen time than the normal fights and the megazord wasn't too impressive , it looks like optimus prime from a Michael bay movie. The best character in this movie is billy the blue ranger and putting everything aside , Bryan Tyler composed a great music score and even remastered the original theme song. So in the end , power rangers is not wearing tights and posing at explosions , it's a perfect summer movie which brings back memories and revives your childhood. Oh and don't forget to stop by at krispy kreme .",Power Rangers

I liked Billy's character the beat and I even like Aplja . For people wanting something fast pace this is not that it honestly SIG's into the characters and makes a real story line. I was less that the gay character was very out spoken and etc not so much there is a scene where we speakers about it.but to be truthfull unless and they won't kids are deeply listing then they won't catch it. I really loved the darker feel of this and how the characters did not already know everything and had to learn unlike all the shows where they go all seem to already know how to fight and etc even though most od the power rangers shows not all they are pteenagers with no previous expirence. I did not like Gordon kind of annoying but other wise good movie . I think a second could be even better now that we know their back story's.",Power Rangers
119,slicedbread117,"Exceeds, Yet Falls Short of Expectations",6,7 June 2017,"We've seen a huge string of 80's/90's kids cartoons re-imagined into modern movie blockbusters recently, ranging from pretty good to worse than could possibly imagine (Transformers 4). Power Rangers is next in line for a big movie remake, and while definitely far from perfect, its nostalgic influence and surprisingly character- development-heavy story gives a better than expected film. Okay, yes the plot is as generic as anything you'll ever see; it's predictable and cheesy, as expected from a film like this. What you don't expect from said film, however, is for it to focus more heavily on strong character development. To my pleasant surprise, I found myself enjoying each Ranger more and more as their interactions continued on, as extra emphasis is definitely put into each Ranger's individual story arc. By the time they were all teamed up and ready to go go (pun), I felt that they were more of a team than if they had just been thrown together meaninglessly. Some Rangers stand out more than others, but each was written to try and accomplish a meaningful team-up, which gives you something in the movie to connect with, which proves vital since the overall narrative suffers pretty heavily.Unfortunately, the extra time spent of character development leaves some aspects of what makes a complete film behind. The pacing is way off balance, often going too slow to stay intrigued through the first two acts, and subsequently rushed to almost an extreme in the final act to make up for the lost action time earlier on. There is an alarming lack of action sequences, and while deeper story arcs for the Rangers is welcomed, at the end of the day, you want to see them in action! There's way too much build up to them finally acquiring their armor, teaming up and fighting to keep you excited and entertained. All of this is so unfortunate, because the action really is fun to watch. The CG visuals aren't Avengers-esque, but when the Rangers are finally battling together, it's honestly pretty cool. The choreography is respectable, and the Rangers' Zords are also pretty sweet, but criminally underused.The cast chosen to portray our favorite Mighty Morphin' Rangers isn't half bad, with some more inspiring performances than others. RJ Cyler easily stands out as the Billy the Blue Ranger, while Becky G. is noticeable for her portrayal of the Trini the Yellow Ranger, an openly gay character in the film, a choice I give props to the writing team for deciding upon, as it gives the Rangers a unique, less generic chemistry. The other actors, Dacre Montgomery, Naomi Scott and Ludi Lin as the Red, Pink and Black Rangers respectively, are all passable for a film of this caliber. All of the main cast is young and inexperienced, so any award-winning performances were not once expected. Bryan Cranston, Bill Hader and Elizabeth Banks fill out the supporting cast as Zordon, Alpha 5 and the villain Rita, respectively. Cranston is fine as Zordon, though underused and underdeveloped. Hader does well voicing Alpha 5, and provides most of the film's comic relief. Then, there's Elizabeth Banks' Rita, who was absolutely horrible. The performance was poor, bland and uninspired, add to that the character's abysmal writing and you have by far the worst character in the film. All around though, the main cast was solid, and each give a little extra personalization to their respective characters.When it comes to these types of films, old kids cartoon remakes, I often say that you can't go into the movie expecting anything revolutionary. Power Rangers may go for a serious tone and fall short in some areas, but nonetheless, it stays standing by providing a deeper element of character development than expected, and exciting, while underused, action scenes. This film most definitely works best as a rooting project, planting the seeds for a franchise that will hopefully produce more intriguing stories and more action, but with the box office sales in the dumps that may never happen. So, it may not be gold, or silver for that matter, but Power Rangers is still a fun pop-corn flick with some room for enjoyment if you dig down deep into your childhood memories.6/10",Power Rangers
120,amichnea,"It is a Kids movie, origin story, so please calm down",10,27 June 2017,"Anyone that was a child when the Power Rangers was on TV will be early 30's to late early 40's. Writing a review based on your memories stating that this movie destroyed the Power Rangers of old time is just sad.I actually liked it and yes I am one of those kids. The movie is very simple. They are building up the characters, each being a misfit, they are teenagers so YES you will get a lot of the teenager drama that comes along with being a teenager. It is pretty much an Origin Superhero movie, slow at start but ending with a Bang when the heroes discover their full potential.Why would anyone compare this to the Transformers? It is filmed the same way, the special effects are pretty much the same but this is because at the end of the day they have similarities (robots, transforming) and they can only show them one way. Bear in mind that Power Rangers type of series have been around since the 70s and 80s especially in Japan and China. So NO they did not copy Transformers and the first Power Ranger movie was actually done before any of the Transformers movies. Unfortunately any movie that shows big robots and morphings will be compared to the Transformers.The movie does keep true to the original series and I have enjoyed it. I also liked seeing some of the original rangers in the crowd.Does it deserve a 10? Probably not but neither does a 1 nor do other waste of time movies/series deserve a 10.

121,Badmoviessuck,wE ShOUlD BuILd a bANd,3,14 February 2019,"This movie is a complete mess.DIALOGUE
The dialogue has a bunch of cringy one liners and it's not good at all.
They have a tendency to explain everything to us instead of showing us which is stupid.CHARACTERS
It feels like they tried to give the characters depth but during the production they just ignored it.
Jason has daddy issues and that gets ignored through the rest of the movie, Zack has a dying mother and that gets ignored as well, Trini has strict parents and that gets ignored, and the pink ranger has some school drama and that gets ignored (probably for the better).
None of them have true desires and motives and they dont change and grow and how they got together was stupid.
Jason protected black boy and pink ranger conveniently swam in that place were black boy explode stuff and Zack is just conveniently sitting somewhere and star power shows up from nowhere.
There was this scene were trini ran away from the others for no reason and i was confused.VILLAIN
The villain wants gold and she is stupid
first she has no real motive than to get kristalls cause of power which is really bland.
And also she is stupid.
She attacks Star power for no reason and explains were she is headed and then leaves her and dosen't even kill her which is very stupid.
And once they found the villain cause she explained were she was to Star power then they all go there get captured and then the villain explains her freaking plan which is really cliche and stupid.ACTION
The action is bland and there is nothing special to it and the final act was worse than black panthers final act.
How could they now that the megazord had wings that could be used as daggers when they have never even seen how the megazord looks? I'ts stupid.VERDICT
This movie is a cliche mess that should have never existed.
There is already tons of power rangers series and movies why make another? Oh right i know, money.",Power Rangers

123,bodhi-13262,How late is Morphin' time?,6,15 April 2017,"Haim Saban's 'Power Rangers' return to the big screen for the first time in twenty years. Headed by director Dean Israelite (Project Almanac) and with a script by long-time writer John Gatins, does this film produce enough fuel to successfully morph?1. I suppose I'd start off on a good note and say that the story is pretty well written and has a nice flow to it. The credit really goes to writer John Gatins who's biggest screenplay credit is the 2012 Denzel Washington drama 'Flight'. The initial setup of all five characters was surprisingly well done. From Jason's (Dacre Montgomery) first interaction with Billy (RJ Cyler) in detention, to them all coincidentally running into each other at the quarry, everything has a nice organic feel. I didn't expect them to flesh out the main characters as much as they did, but somehow they pulled it off. Even the film's opening sequence gives Zordon (Bryan Cranston) a decent enough backstory which sufficiently explains how he becomes what we all know him as.2. As a fan of the 'Power Rangers' since birth, I was especially excited to see my favorite (Jason/Red Ranger) back in action. Assigned as the leader of the Rangers, I think newcomer Dacre Montgomery was an excellent choice for the part. Not only does he reflect qualities of a leader as he mingles with the others, but his story seems to be the most developed among the rest. The three guys on the team undoubtedly have the better story arcs while the two girls felt a little lazy to be honest. I use the word ""lazy"" in regards to the problems the two face, because in actuality, they aren't really serious problems at all. Kimberly (Naomi Scott) is dealing with the sudden excommunication by her cheer-leading squad, while Trini (Becky G) is just distraught that her parents aren't in tune with her rebellious lifestyle. 3. All in all, there just wasn't a solid or believable enough stories to follow Kimberly nor Trini. Also, not only are the guys given better and relate-able stories, but their acting feels superior than the girls'. However, that can be overlooked as it's not that big of an issue. Bryan Cranston and Bill Hader voice Zordon and Alpha 5 respectively, and of course, when Bill Hader's part of any cast, humor always follows. I must give a round of applause to the make-up artists on this film, because it takes a tremendous amount of effort to make someone as beautiful as Elizabeth Banks to look ugly as Rita Repulsa. Banks' appearance as Rita is (of course) a swift departure from that of the TV show, but it's for the better. Let's just say she gives new meaning to being a space sorceress.4. I honestly was in love with this movie for the first two-thirds, but the biggest problem hits at exactly the 90th minute. I'm not spoiling anything, but as a fan, there just wasn't enough screen- time when we finally get the team as full-on 'Power Rangers'. The film's running time is exactly 120mins, and we don't get to see the Rangers morph as a team until exactly 90mins in. At this point things are utterly rushed as they face-off against Rita and the giant Goldar for the climax. Even though the CGI could have used a little more rendering on the Zords, I was thoroughly impressed by them as well as the new Ranger suits. If the film-makers were to draw inspiration from movies of Michael Bay and Guillermo Del Toro to make the perfect blend of the fantastic Dino- Bot CGI and action of 'Transformers' together with the terrific giant Kaiju & Jaeger fights from 'Pacific Rim', this film would have been made awesome. Dean Israelite does the best directing job he can, which I give him kudos for. I don't regret seeing this in theaters cause I do give this film lots of praise for successfully rebooting a franchise that was decades out of date. Had it not been rushed near the end with a better balance of the action against the drama, 'Power Rangers' would have a higher rating than I'm giving it. I still had a fun time and would recommend it to younger audiences despite the lengthy wait.",Power Rangers
124,NewDivide1701,"Excellent reimagining, lousy execution.",4,11 July 2017,"Bottom line there is hardly a plot nor any real character development where everything that this movie could have been seemed to be sacrificed for a forced ""must work together"" movie that seemed heavily clichéd and not able to find its own identity as 5 misfits find their way to become the power rangers.Sadly neither of the rangers, especially Zack and Trini, don't really stand out in comparison to the original 1993 Power Ranger where the new rangers are about as 2 dimensional as they can get with a story that is easily forgettable with action scenes that is nearly as forgettable.But all was not was lost as the whole re-imagined world of the origins of the conflict between Zordon and Rita has a level of intrigue that grabs your attention as well as why Zordon is now a floating head on a wall. The new Goldar, the new putty like troopers, even the new Rita took away the childish campiness and replaced her into someone who is a bonafide threat.But poor story and forgettable rangers really hurt the reboot, where not even the new Zords could save. But it was still better than Turbo: A Power Rangers movie.",Power Rangers
125,scottingram,Power Rangers (2017) Film Review,7,26 March 2017,"The new action film Power Rangers the newly rebooted film based on the hit and hugely popular 90's US TV Series about a group of teenagers superheroes who have to keep the planet Earth safe from the forces of evil starring Bryan Cranston and Elizabeth Banks.In Power Rangers Saban's Power Rangers follows five ordinary high school kids Jason Scott (Australian actor Dacre Montgomery - Safer Neighborhood, A Few Less Men), Billy Cranston (American actor RJ Cyler - Me And Earl And The Dying Girl, US TV Series Vice Principals), Kimberly Hart (English actress Naomi Scott - The 33, TV Series Terra Nova), Asian actor Ludi Lin (TV Series Marco Polo, Monster Hunt) as Zack, American actress Becky G (US TV Series Empire, House Of Sin) as Trini who must become something extraordinary when they learn that their small town of Angel Grove – and the world – is on the verge of being obliterated by an alien threat led by the evil Rita Repulsa (American actress Elizabeth Banks - Pitch Perfect films, Spider-Man films). Chosen by destiny by Zordon (American actor Bryan Cranston - US TV Series Breaking Bad, Total Recall 2012) who is a big talking face on a computer screen and his trusty sidekick Alpha 5 (voiced by American actor Bill Hader - Trainwreck, Men In Black 3), our heroes quickly discover that they are the only ones who can save the planet by becoming The Power Rangers with Jason becoming the Red Ranger, Billy becoming the Blue Ranger, Kimberly becoming the Pink Ranger, Zack becoming the Black Ranger and Trini becoming the Yellow Ranger. But to do so they will have to overcome their real-life issues and band together as the Power Rangers before it is too late.Amongst the other actors / actresses in Power Rangers include American actor Matt Shively (Paranormal Activity 4, April Apocalypse) as Damo, Cody Kearsley (TV Series Riverdale) as Hawkeye, American actor David Denman (13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers Of Benghazi, After Earth) as Sam Scott Jason's dad, Robert Moloney (Random Acts Of Romance, The Revenant) as Ted Hart Kimberly's dad, English actress of Indian descent Anjali Jay (The Age Of Adaline, Blind Dating) as Maddy Hart Kimberly's mum, Canadian actress Sarah Grey (TV Series Legends Of Tomorrow, Cinemanovels) as Amanda, Canadian actress Morgan Taylor Campbell (Sadie's Last Days On Earth, No Men Beyond This Point) as Harper, Canadian actress Caroline Cave (Saw VI, One Week) as Beverly Scott, Canadian actress Kayden Magnuson (TV Series Chesapeake Shores, Monkey Up) as Pearl Scott, Canadian actress Lisa Berry (The Colony, No Stranger Than Love) as Candace Cranston Billy's mum, John Stewart (US HorrorTV Series Fear The Walking Dead which is a spin-off of the US Horror TV Series The Walking Dead, Walking Tall) as a detention teacher, Fiona Fu (TV Series Blood And Water) as Zack's mum, English actor Garry Chalk (Godzilla 2014, Freddy vs. Jason) as Captain Bowen, Canadian actor Patrick Sabongui (TV Series The Flash and Homeland) as Trini's dad and Canadian actress Erica Cerra (TV Series The 100, Percy Jackson & The Olympians: The Lightning Thief) as Trini's mum.Power Rangers was filmed on location in the province of British Columbia in Canada the second largest country in the world.Overall Power Rangers is a good action film filled with action, violence, shooting, fighting, battling, explosions, things getting blown up, wrecked, destroyed etc, team work, togetherness, problem troubled teenagers, sci-fi, science, incredible technology, weird bizarre things, quarries, stunning scenery, crowds of people, fall outs, disagreements, loyalty, family, friendship, on the edge of your seat stuff, waterfalls, rain, trains, cars, zords, incredible powers of strength and many other things throughout the film.So I will give Power Rangers an overall rating of 3 out of 5 stars and I will say Power Rangers is worth seeing if you are a fan of the Power Rangers TV Series from the 90's and the two Power Rangers films that followed suit in 1995 and 1997, Chronicle, Project Almanac, Avengers films, Transformers films, X-Men films amongst others. So if get the chance to see Power Rangers in the cinema then you should go and see it sooner than later and I should mention that I watched the Power Rangers TV Series from the 90's when it use to be on the TV on Sky One on the DJ Kat Show and just on its own and I was a big Power Rangers fan growing up and I was addicted to the TV Series which ran in the UK from 1994 until about 1997 which was titled Mighty Morphin Power Rangers which I watched on the TV day in day out week in week out and I had all the toy zords like the first Megazord which was made of the dino zords, the thunder zords that made up the Thunder Megazord, the ninja zords that made up the Ninja Megzord, the shogun zords that made up the Shogun Megazord, the Power Rangers figures, some of the monsters etc. The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers TV Series ran for three seasons before it became Power Rangers Zeo which I watched in 1997 then it became Power Rangers Turbo which I watched for a bit but I couldn't get in to it and then I lost track of Power Rangers after that. But I do still have fond memories of watching Mighty Morphin Power Rangers and Power Rangers Zeo but nothing the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers TV Series that ran for three seasons from 1994 until 1997 when Power Rangers Zeo came in to force on UK TV screens and so on.",Power Rangers

With a threat, that will help tear them apart, played seductively and beautifully by the one alien woman that would be the breaking point of the Rangers – Rita Repulsa (Elizabeth Banks – The Hunger Games franchise), she will stop at nothing to take over the world.

132,MichaelNontonMulu,The 21st Century Reboot of Popular 1990s Kids TV series,7,22 March 2017,"My wife and I were pretty entertained with this movie. It was quite  full of humor and fun all around. Watching the new Power Rangers suits  were also pretty cool, especially if we compared against the suits from  the original TV series back in the 1990s. Of course the special effects  in this movie was pretty amazing. The CGI was done pretty nicely and  neat. Loved the action sequence in the last part of the movie during  the fight between the Rangers and Goldar. Sound effects were good, and  maybe would be more amazing if you see in Dolby Atmos theaters.  After watching it for full 2 hours, the movie duration seemed to be  just nice. It was not too rushed in the process of characters  introduction and the time spent for the training to become the Power  Rangers felt sufficient. It did not take too long or too short, and  still have enough time for the big finale. Overall, the pace of the  movie felt just perfect. The movie had brief moments of jokes that felt  more appropriate for teenagers and not suitable for children. So I feel  that the movie seemed to be aimed more for teenagers rather than for  children, although the original series were actually shown in kids TV.  This is also the reason why a lot of adults also watched this movie to  reminiscent the good fun time when they watched the series (my wife was  a great example of this audience).  In addition, the movie also had some cheesy moments and felt very  light. There was no over-complication of plots, just a simple good old  fashion pop corn movie to be enjoyed without over thinking. For this  kind of movie, people should not expect a deep conversation and various  twists. This is a movie that I feel would provide the fans of the  original series satisfaction. Almost all the characters were there in  the movie, with of course other characters that might join the sequels.  This movie also had some brief interesting scene during the mid end-  credit part. But there was nothing at the very end. So there is no need  to wait till the very last scene if you are in a rush to the wash room.   So if you are looking for a fun light team of superheroes movie based  on the popular 1990s TV series, then you would not be disappointed and  you would be entertained by this. But if you are looking for a heavier  super hero movies from popular comic books like Marvel comics or DC  comics kind, then this might not be your thing.

133,walkingwithprimeval,"No, No, Power Rangers",5,1 July 2021,"When I first heard that a new Power Rangers film adaptation was going to get made with a more lavished and sophisticated Hollywood makeover, I thought to myself; ""Seriously? You've got to be kidding me."" When I eventually saw the first teaser trailer, I wasn't the least bit excited for its release. I kept thinking to myself; ""You know? This doesn't look like Power Rangers, at all. Looks way more like Josh Trank's Chronicle than anything else."" When the movie first came out and I got around to seeing it with some pretty low-expectations, it still managed to be a major let down and I was disappointed (but it's been several years since then and I've gotten over it). Now that some time has passed after all these years, I've decided to go back and try to rewatch it over again in an attempt to better evaluate my thoughts since I'm able to properly articulate my real honest feelings on the movie as a whole and see whether or not my opinions on it have changed at all (so it's all fresh in my mind, once more). The film as a whole is filled with so many contrivances that none of its story beats flow together naturally and the humour doesn't always land for me, either (except for Bill Hager's Alpha 5, who did give me a good chuckle from time to time).At times, I felt like I was watching a coming-of-age teen movie and not Power Rangers, and I admired those aspects of the film. But it has such an incredibly jarring tonal shift halfway through, acting like a little small-scale quirky indie drama about a dysfunctional group of social outcasts one minute, and then going all-out into full-on tentpole summer blockbuster mode with the cheesy sci-if concept of intergalactic super-beings who battle against evil forces by controlling big robot dinosaurs (you see the clashing of tones, here?). It's almost like the filmmakers didn't really know how to handle, or even approach, this sort of crazy-but-cool material and so they decided to try this awkward mishmash of different genre elements that don't quite fit. Moments of the journey these loner high-school youths go on can be mildly compelling, like with the campfire scene that happens at the midway point. Each one of them is shown discussing their own personal turmoil that they have to overcome and watching the emotionally-vulnerable ""teenagers with attitude"" open up to one another about the everyday adolescent problems of growing into maturity is admittedly kind of charming, as is seeing them all unite together in the third act (and their whole team-dynamic was also fairly well-developed).Nowadays, I often find myself bored senseless by most modern large-scale movies I see as they're too reliant on CGI-heavy sequences (example; fully CGI characters fighting in a completely CGI environment, which was all the elaborate creation of a VFX team rendering their CGI work on hundreds of computer screens). After a while, it just leaves my brain feeling numb from all the big action set-pieces and lengthy scenes of mindless destruction, which SHOULD be epic and NOT dull (I'm tired of always staring at a longwinded video game cutscene). Marvel Studios are the only ones who've managed to keep the utilisation of photorealistic-CGI visual-effects feeling fresh due mainly in part to them hiring the same VFX companies over and over again, so they're pretty much pros at this point in time and know what they're doing when it comes to seamlessly compositing every digitally-created background shot together in the same scene (not to mention, they have way more money put into their mega-budgets along with the extra time and resources to properly render everything out).And by the way, whatever happened to the colour-palette's bright vibrancy that the Power Rangers franchise has always been predominantly known for? (not to mention, where've all the exciting flashy sparks gone?). After Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy, suddenly everyone wanted to get in on the whole ""making superhero films all dark and serious"" craze (and that includes having muted colours). Reimagining the fun-loving upbeat tone of the original colourful source material isn't clever writing, it's just copying what everybody else is doing and reinventing the playful tongue-in-cheek brand for edgy teens and cynical adults to enjoy (much like with the travesty of Michael Bay's Transformers). There's nothing inherently wrong with this practice of business model per say, but there's a limit to how far you're able to ground something like this in total realism (I mean, seriously now). I'll say this in the film's defence, at least it's darkened aesthetic isn't as ugly for my eyes to look at as let's say the murky cinematography of Zack Snyder's movies are (I've just never enjoyed the man's ""artistic vision"").Getting into Power Rangers fan-mode for just a bit; I have very mixed feelings on the Rangers' Zords. On one hand, I like the fact that these powerful alien fighting machines actually appear to be of a somewhat techno-organic nature. But on the other hand, some of the robots are designed in such a bizarre way that it makes them look kind of silly. I mean, the T-Rex, Pterodactyl and Sabretooth all look fine to me (as far as ""Bayformer"" Dinobots go). But what's up with the Triceratops and Mastodon having additional pairs of legs, huh? (I got to say, it's a downright weird stylistic choice to do that). The idea of these colossal assault vehicles taking on the giant molten Goldar monster in their individual metallic beast forms first is neat, but I wasn't too thrilled with the way in which they executed that whole half of the end battle. And the entire Megazord transformation sequence for the final climactic one-on-one brawl could've been shown in much greater detail than it was, being mostly obscured by fiery digital-effects.Rita Repulsa's actress was practically chewing the scenery and hamming it all the way up with her villainess performance, tipping over the acting scale and pushing the dial far past 10 (Elizabeth Banks appears to be the only cast member who's actually having a blast in their role). Bryan Cranston returning to the franchise in a more prominent capacity as wise mentor Zordon was respectable fan-service and an honourable tribute, it seems. And the famous original ""Go Go"" theme song was also a nice inclusion, too (that was a real treat to hear). But with all that Power Rangers nostalgia put aside, is it a good movie on its own for non-fans to watch? Well, now... I'm going to say no, not really (it isn't). The general moviegoing public may find it to be a stale cliched superhero film, about the ancient search for a mystical artefact that's existed since before time began, and will most likely want to opt out in favour of waiting for the next Marvel or DC movie to come along. And the actual diehard purists won't like many of the changes it makes to the long-running series' lore and mythos. And so after numerous compromises by the clueless filmmakers (and possibly the meddling studios, as well), there might not be that much of an incentive left for people to actually WANT to watch this and before you know it, you end up with an unsatisfactory subpar movie that's made to please no one (a lose-lose situation for all parties involved).",Power Rangers
134,WhenAmyMetSalad,Mighty Morphin with SPOILERS at the end.,2,21 April 2017,"TL;DR - Slow, boring, not entertaining, Fant4stic was better. I followed this movie around the time it was first announced and even partook in the boards and seeing all the news and leaks about the movie. I was not too fond of certain things about this movie especially certain casting as I felt it wouldn't fit. I honestly really wanted to enjoy this movie but when the trailer hit I had a bad feeling and should have stuck to it. My friend dragged me to go watch it with him and I hated almost every minute. After reading mixed reviews the ones that resonated with me are the ones that shared my same opinions. The movie lacked good comedy, needed to improve on action. It dragged and dragged with these poorly acted characters and mundane character development for our protagonists. The only fun character was Rita. Elizabeth Banks did a great job making that character hers and making her feel more menacing than she was in the show. I've only ever liked her in one other franchise and that was The Hunger Games so to be honest I am surprised I liked Rita as much.--- ***SPOILERS BELOW***---The movie started off good with the ending of a battle scene which introduced our antagonist and the seriousness of a threat our heroes will encounter down the road. Rita literally kills the previous Ranger team and is the ever so loved Green Ranger which was teased and theorized throughout set photo leaks. This scene and the final Battle where Rita gets B-chSlapped to the moon was the only entertaining thing in this whole movie. Everything in between was utterly boring. You will seriously have a more fun time watching the Ghostbusters Remake or the Fant4stic reboot.",Power Rangers
135,ReelLifeReviews,A fun ride for fans,6,25 March 2017,"Power Rangers (2017) - Dust off your Mossimo t-shirts and JNCO jeans, everyone, because if the Power Rangers can make a comeback, anything is possible.I had a lot more fun with this movie than I thought I would. Australian actor Dacre Montgomery led the way as the red ranger and was the standout overall. His role lent to this, but he very easily could have fallen flat. I would expect to see him in more films going forward.There weren't any big names in the new crew, and while some were stronger than others, they did quite well as a whole. They played well off of one another and I bought the group dynamic early on. It did have a few big names in other roles with Brian Cranston, Elizabeth Banks, and Bill Heder. Brian Cranston played a giant head in the wall that is basically just a surly old man the whole time. Elizabeth Banks seemed like she filmed all of her scenes before the producers decided to actually take the project seriously. And Bill Heder does the voice of a cartoon robot mascot that just did not work for me on any level.There are definitely some campy moments and a plot hole or two, but they don't undermine what ends up being a satisfying trip down memory lane. If you weren't a fan of the TV show or had never seen it, this probably isn't the movie for you. But if you are a true kid of the 90's, then Go Go - 6.5/10",Power Rangers
136,DJKwa,The Power Rangers reboot gets the job done,6,12 June 2017,"The inherent silliness of teenagers in colourful suits fighting rock shaped monsters is not lost on the filmmakers of 2017's big-budget Power Rangers reboot. As a more grounded, realistic take on the franchise, the action is frequently broken up by jokey banter between the characters, who display a keen sense of self-awareness. As a group of high school kids who suddenly become alien fighting superheroes, the self-awareness goes a long way in keeping the film palatable for those unaccustomed to the series' brand of over the top action. Even so, the film doesn't hold back embracing the craziness that's part and parcel of being a Power Rangers movie, making for a film that will likely appeal to both newcomers and long-time fans alike. Power Rangers is quick to establish that it's not going to be your garden variety, Saturday morning cartoon kind of adaptation. It opens with a dramatic car chase with protagonist Jason Scott (Dacre Montgomery) trying to outrun the police. With the cops hot on his tail, the camera whirls around the interior of the car – between Jason in the driver's seat and the sirens chasing behind him. When he looses control of the vehicle, we witness the crash from the cockpit of the car, in a slow dramatic shot that lingers on Jason as the crash rattles his body. It's a well-directed scene that sets the film's grittier tone from the onset. These minor moments of inspiration lend the film a surprising gravitas. Director Dean Israelite (Project Almanac) does an admirable job of balancing the drama with the action. Make no mistake, this is an origin story and the first half of the film effectively acts like a John Hughes coming of age drama; giving us insight into the troubled lives of the teens both at school and at home. While the film's characterisations never rise above the usual high school movie clichés, it's at least commendable that they put in the effort to develop the characters before their suits supersede them. When the teens finally gain their powers, the film does a complete 180 and turns into the cheesy 90's superhero adaptation fans would expect. I couldn't help but laugh when Elizabeth Banks' hammy villain, Rita Repulsa, first appears on screen and yet her gleefully overdone performance is only the tip of a cheese iceberg. The finale embraces the series' kitschy roots to deliver a succession of over the top, CGI fueled, action sequences that seem to have come from the mind of an 8-year old high on a sugar rush. At first the shift from drama to camp is quite jarring, yet by the time the teens are all suited up and the Power Rangers theme kicks in, it's hard not to give in to its shamelessness. The arc of the story in Power Rangers is so bizarre that if someone where to watch only the beginning and end of the film, you couldn't fault them for thinking that they were watching two completely different movies. While the film struggles to reconcile the darker, grittier tone of the first half with the campy, cheesy second, it does manage to provide enough substance to keep the audience invested when the crazy action kicks in. It may not break any new ground but as a modern update, Power Rangers gets the job done.",Power Rangers
137,adam111111,A surprisingly solid teen action flick.,7,28 June 2017,"I was expecting very, very little from this movie. In addition to the Michael Bay-style CGI extravaganza that I was thinking was going to be there, there was also a great deal of other stuff going on, like some stock-issue teenage drama and extensive promotional materials from Krispy-Kreme. That last note was particularly weird, and the fact that the secret to preserving the entire earth was under a Krispy-Kreme. Incidentally, there were at least three extended shots of people gleefully eating doughnuts from, where else, Krispy-Kreme.This is not a particularly original movie. It does not stretch the limits of film as art, nor is it particularly funny or exciting. It is a solid movie though, and one that is worth watching, if offered.",Power Rangers
138,TharsheyN,A Wonderful Movie That Hits Just Right!,8,26 July 2021,"So before I even start my review I will say that I've never watched anything Power Rangers before. The most I'd seen is maybe an episode or two of the show when I was like 8 years old.The movie starts off pretty interesting though it does take a bit long before any of the action. However I don't mind this at all, as they take time to setup the world and the characters and I would honestly not have minded another 30m or so off world building and character building if they had gone that route.The storyline is nothing special and is pretty basic, however what brings me back to this movie every time, and I've watched it like 5 times now, is the relationship that's built between the Rangers. It's the best part of the film and each time I watched the film seeing the Rangers becoming friends and then family is really amazing. The best performance while everyone did do a good job goes hands down to A. J. Cyler aka Billy Cranston. He does an amazing job with his role and steals the spotlight every time.I know there was a general hint at the red ranger and pink ranger aka Naomi Scott and Dacre Montgomery having a romantic relationship at some point. However it was mostly cut from the film besides the slow building of their relationship throughout the film. However I disagree and actually would prefer to see Dacre/Red Ranger do his whole solo leader stint and allow Billy and Kimberly to get together... I know probably everyone reading this will disagree and that's fine but that's how much I liked the Blue Ranger/Billy.The rest of the cast as said before do admirable jobs and the special effects while not anything mind blowing are also pretty great.All in all the movie is fun to watch and I'll be rewatching it soon as well, just because I like the family (laughs in Dominic Torreto) dynamic they have going on between the Rangers, even I I don't agree on all the relationships they try to set up.8/10 from me and if you're a fan of the old PR series I wouldn't recommend this to you if you thinking nostalgia before watching, I would recommend this to anyone wanting to see a Power Rangers reboot or Origin story as this is pretty much what it is!",Power Rangers
139,SamALMan,Power Rangers in 2017,2,27 May 2018,"This movie is good if it is compared to power rangers TV series. Very simple and into the point. I expected lengthy teenage conversations but surprisingly they were short but still there was lot of talking in this movie and less meaningful and more predicted scenes. The modern visual techniques just added more fun to the work. It ""could"" be enjoyed by power rangers fans. I've never liked power rangers so it is not a good movie to me!",Power Rangers
140,smetin,A Nostalgia Trip...It's Morphin Time!,8,24 March 2017,"When this movie got announced, I was immediately excited. I hadn't watched Power Rangers since I was maybe 10 years old. I still remember coming downstairs on a Sunday morning to watch it. The original movie also sticks in my mind as one of my favourites in my youth. This movie had a lot riding on it, considering so many people like myself would watch this purely for nostalgia's sake.The movie starts in typical Power Rangers style: with some action in a jokey style. As the plot progresses you begin to meet characters who you know will become Power Rangers. They are introduced well and are given a fairly decent backstory, most of which you learn as the movie progresses. I felt as though I knew a little about each of the Rangers before they morphed, although most of it was somewhat of a cliché.I thoroughly enjoyed the training segments, along with the introduction of alpha-5 and Zordon. It really took me back to my childhood, but with a modern spin that I felt was not too drastically different from the original. The villain in this movie was creepy though. Far creepier than she was in the original. I can see why this film was given a slightly more mature rating, because I can see how it would not be suitable for younger children. In this sense, I am slightly annoyed as Power Rangers is in essence a children's thing. By giving it a more mature slant to appeal to the masses, you are depriving the true target audience. But that is just my opinion. It is only in the last 45 minutes where the true action begins and we see our characters morph for the first time. The new suits look awesome and I was impressed with the fighting sequences. When the Zords came into play I actually got goosebumps. The ""Go Go Power Rangers"" song playing the background may have been what caused this, because I truly felt like a kid again. It was great. The final battle scene was excellent; you certainly get enough bang for your buck here!In summation, this is certainly a film worth seeing amidst all the superhero films currently our there. If you are of my generation then I urge you to see this in the cinema, rather than watch it on DVD/Blu-Ray/digital later on. The big screen in addition to the Dolby surround surround sound made this an experience I am so happy to have had.",Power Rangers
141,TheJediWay9,"A Fairly Enjoyable ""Power Rangers"" Movie Completely Falls Apart In Its Clunky Third Act",4,23 March 2017,"""Power Rangers: The No-One-Gives-A-S#!t Edition"" is directed by Dean Isrealite on a screenplay from John Gatins, Mark Sazama, Burk Sharpless, and Kieran & Michelle Mulroney and focuses on a group of teenagers who are screw ups. They are outcasts in their school and society until they stumble upon these power coins and a spaceship and its there that they learn they are a new generation of Power Rangers.I was born in 1994 and was quite familiar with the Power Rangers when I was a kid. Whenever they were on TV, these were the superheroes my brother and I looked up to. Watching the god-awful but somehow hilariously bad ""Might Morphin Power Rangers"" movie from 1997 where every time they kick a monster into a wall it explodes into purple goo (no joke) from a very young age somehow told me that I wanted to be a Power Ranger. then I grew up, the Power Rangers weren't popular anymore, and now I am in college.Enter 2017, where studios try to make everything a ""thing"" now, and that is the case with this movie. I had a slimmer of hope that this movie would be good. And if it wasn't good, I was hoping it would at least be enjoyable in that fun, cheesy, goofy, entertaining type way that the show was back in the 90s.I'm not gonna lie: for the first two-thirds of this movie, I found what I was watching fairly enjoyable. Was it ground-breaking? No. It seemed like they were going to finally get a Power Rangers movie right for the first time. I was supporting these characters the whole way. There's a scene in the middle of the movie where they have a heart-to-heart with one another, and that scene actually provided some nice character depth and backstory for those characters whose backstory was completely glossed over at the beginning of the film. All of the actors playing the Power Rangers were also really good. Naomi Scott, RJ Cyler, Dacre Montgomery, Becky G, and Ludi Line. all five of them did a good job in their roles. The movie really hinged on them and if they ended up sucking, this movie would have been a complete failure.Elizabeth Banks was just a cartoon copy of herself. She was so over the top in such a serious movie that both her plan and her character became stupid after awhile. She was a definition of a cliché villain, showing up only to pose a threat and not really do much and then be at the center of the final throw down. Bryan Cranston as Zordon... pretty good actually.Aside from Elizabeth Banks, everything leading up to the climatic showdown was actually pretty enjoyable. Watching the Power Rangers train was actually pretty cool, and seeing them stumble upon their Zords for the first time was quite the site. But then the third act happened, and it completely derailed the movie. Everything leading up to the point at the beginning of the third act where a Krispy Kreme Doughnuts became a plot device was fairly good. Once this plot device is introduced, that and everything after it is a complete waste of time. It's all bad. There's nothing good about the third act of this movie. Sure you have the Power Rangers kicking ass, that's what we all wanted to see, but it looked really sloppy. This movie fell into the habit of having its action scenes filmed in what I like to call ""Slow-Fast-Mo,"" which is a style that was cool ten years ago for one movie then everyone started doing it and it began to suck. Things in this third act happen that don't make any sense. How are they flying their Zords if they haven't flown them before? The special effects are really terrible. The CGI looked like it came from a Playstation 2 game's cut scenes, and of course there's a giant monster....that they have to fight...and it's gold... and gigantic. There was nothing exciting about this fight. I didn't care about this small town and whether or not it got destroyed. It's in the middle of frigging nowhere. It's strange to think that this movie is fairly enjoyable for the first two acts and makes you believe that you are watching a good movie. Once that third act pops up though, it really just becomes what the TV show was. Bad. But unlike the TV show and the 1997 movie, this was bad in bad way.I am going to give ""Power Rangers"" a 4.2/10.Check out my video review of ""Power Rangers"" here: https://www.youtube.com/watch? v=ckFQeFdsIv0&t=25s",Power Rangers
142,MikeC19,"Not a good film, not at all.",3,11 May 2017,"I was never a huge fan of ""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers"", but I went in, open to trying this film. I was sorely, sorely disappointed. I left this movie thinking, ""This was a *bad* movie!"" Now, there are movies out there, that are absolute garbage, the acting is bad, almost everything is bad. I admit, this is not the worst movie I've ever seen, however, there's a lot wrong with it! The Bad: There's crude humor, lame and dated jokes we've heard in hundreds of other movies, some bad language and dozens of tired movie clichés. We've seen it all before is what I'm saying. There's is very little to be enjoyed in this movie. It's an origin story, that kind of lags a bit, and then the action is cranked up near the end, but it's not really that exciting. We've all seen the ""misfits who learn to work together"" story line, and that's all this is. I'm surprised that the creator of the original ""Power Rangers"" OK'd this version. It's pretty terrible for the most part.The Good: Bill Hader's character was amusing, Bryan Cranston brings some levity to this, and Elizabeth Banks does a great job of making you hate her character, which proves her acting is good. The main cast is a bit annoying, but they're OK at playing their stereotypes. Also, the score by Bryan Tyler was very good.So: This is a not a movie I would recommend. It may appeal to some teenagers, and it's not the worst thing they could be watching. Overall, it's just a bad film. Case closed.",Power Rangers
143,NotAnotherMovieCritic,Nostalgia at it's Best,6,9 September 2020,"Back when the original Power Rangers was on television I was glued to the TV and was entranced by the entire show. Of course as I have grown much older and going back to visit the original Power Rangers has sort of the opposite effect. I knew it was cheesy and fun as a kid, but as an adult I cringe but have fond memories.When I heard they were rebooting Power Rangers I wasn't really nervous about it. I figured it would be a cheesy fun reboot, instead what I got was nostalgia at its best. They took what was kind of a goofy premise into something really big, giving it a much better story line and in a lot of ways made it way more adult than it used to be. The characters have depth, but a few of them lack the things that makes me care. I liked what the did to Rita Repulsa, Elizabeth Banks was a lot better than I could have imagined. Bryan Cranston did an excellent job as Zordon. Alpha 5 was a bit of disappointment, but not as bad as I thought it would be.The one thing that had me cringe, yet smile about was the brief moment when the original Power Rangers theme played. Of course and for those of us 90s kids, if you look closely you can catch the original Pink Ranger and Green Ranger briefly, I had to rewind it just to enjoy it again.All in all this film was pretty good and I look forward to any more of the new Power Rangers.",Power Rangers

The Non-Power Rangers Scenes are also very enjoyable and NOT just the Scenes with the Power Rangers. 2. The Pacing is Very Smooth 3. I like The Idea that The Power Coins have more than just Morphing Powers. 4. I thought all of the individual introductions to each of the Ranger Teens where solid and enjoyable, which also includes Alpha 5 and Zordon. 5. The Teens were really likable and enjoyable to watch from the start, despite of there past or present actions. 6. The Teens Feel like real teens from real life. And in addition they are so relatable in one way or another.7. Alpha 5 is much more likable and improved in the movie as to oppose to the 90's TV show. In Star Wars Terms this Alpha 5 is more like R2D2 while the MMPR (Mighty Morphing Power Rangers) 90's TV show Alpha 5 is more like C3PO. 8. I loved the Soundtrack to this movie I found it very fitting in some parts. And while we're on the subject I thought the Soundtrack that went along with the Megazord V Goldar/Reta Fight was Really epic. You or at least I could feel the weight of these Giants and at the same time I could feel the impact of each blow. Unfortunately for me at least, it should have been longer. I wished it lasted for the rest of the climax fight and not just the first three minutes of it.9. Every time when I caught an 'Easter Egg' in the film I felt like my viewing experience was improved by that much, manly because I know what that those 'Easter Eggs' are and how they are referencing the MMPR 90's show. Cons = HIT and/or MISS=1. I have to admit the Opening Intro could be improved slightly, but on the other hand I understand why it was the way it was. 2. I loved the 'Camp Fire Bonding' Scene I found it very touching and fun. I just wish it was a little longer. Or at least long enough for everyone to share. 3. Although Fun and Exciting to hear the Go Go Power Rangers MMPR 90's TV show Theme, I thought it was missed used and too short. That is one Song in the movie I wished they included the entire theme of. But I guess it's better than nothing.

Starring: Dacre Montgomery, Naomi Scott, RJ Cyler, Ludi Lin, Becky G., Elizabeth Banks, Bryan Cranston Director: Why are more people using just first names or names with one letter last names now? I know this has nothing to do with the movie, it's just bothersome to me.With that out of the way, let's get to the movie. Awesome. Well, almost. If it didn't take an hour and a half to get to the teens dressing up it would have been better. As it was, there were still a few other things that hurt the movie. A couple of times, they went back to the childish dialog from the show. Granted, that was more nostalgia than anything, but still. It shouldn't have been in there.The movie does have some great parts as well. The lead up to them donning their suits is quite amazing. Unlike the series, the internal turmoil was something that was needed. When they used the monsters to make turmoil in the shows it just didn't work. Here it was more natural.And the fighting with Zordon was needed. You can't have teens be the main characters with them not having problems with authority. It's just not commonplace.Let's get to the actors. I cheated. I looked up the actors playing the rangers. The youngest one is 23. They couldn't find anyone younger? Make it bit more believable? I would sure as hell try.Final Thoughts: This is the right way to open the new movie series. Is it going to mend with the TV series? I hope not.

147,pokedom,The most unintentionally funny movie of the year!,4,29 July 2017,"Let me start off by saying: I have never, ever, been a Power Rangers fan. Never. Not even as a little kid. It just seemed dumb. So here's this movie trying to cash in on the still popular series. It was never going to be fantastic, but by God it could try. And... I burst out laughing at least 5 times. On complete accident, I should note.I should probably skip talking about every problem before the last act and go directly into talking about the ""final battle"". I use quotes because it's not a battle, it's a product placement. The most shameless and saddening product placement I've ever seen. And I thought Guardians of the Galaxy 2's Dairy Queen product placement bugged me! Anyways, the first 2/3rds of the movie are just training and character development. Which would be fine if it was handled well, but its not. The ""mentor"" character (wall) tells them the world is going to end in 14 days. 14 days and a 5 minute training montage with terrible music later and they haven't learned a thing. So I'll just skip it.The ""final battle"" starts with the blue ranger dying... only to come back to life 5 minutes later. Pretty pointless, but he did tell the main bad girl where the all powerful crystal of life giving energy was, so he had it coming.So at this point no one is asking where this crystal is. I can tell you... you are not ready. It's not at the heart of the town (STORYBROOKE OHMAHGAHD), it's not under the house of a ranger.It is... underneath a goddamn Krispy Kreme.I gave up on the film after this. I was willing to look past the awkward dialogue and acting before and accept this as a nostalgia pander to a crowd I was not in. But this right here got me bursting with laughter. And the final battle is just the power rangers in dino- bots defending a Krispy Kreme. They say it multiple times too, ""We have to protect the Krispy Kreme!"" The main bad girl looks at a cup with the Kreme logo and says ""The crystal..."" and I just burst out laughing again. Really? REALLY? The all powerful crystal of life, the thing that allows the humans of Earth to exist, is underneath a donut shop in Storybrooke. It's so incredibly dumb.The next scene is just the main bad girl eating a donut. YOU CAN'T MAKE THIS STUFF UP! There is a movie based on a nostalgic property that a lot of people love, and their using this lure to show off Krispy Kreme! The movie was iffy before, but this? This feels wrong! No one should willingly sit through this! I did because I figured it would just be generic boring stuff, not a commercial for a donut shop!The movie just kinda ends, after Satan rises from Hell and grabs a bite from Krispy Kreme... sorry, I meant the Megazord rises from the crystal and grabs the main bad girl and blasts her off into space. Then the innocent bystanders, who have just kinda been background noise until now, only NOW whip out their phones and take pictures. Wait, they weren't before? When the main bad girl was destroying the town you weren't livestreaming it to 15 people on Instagram? What kind of town is this?Ultimately this movie was pretty bad. If you're looking for Power Rangers, watch the show instead. It's not worth all the stupid stuff in this movie for you to sit through just to get maybe 20 minutes of the Rangers. I will say this: after this film I said ""Down with the establishment!"" and got Dunkin Donuts instead.",Power Rangers

How good is it going to be.The nostalgic fun was awesome. I used to watch the power rangers back in the early 90s when I was about 9 years old, it was the best thing ever. If I was that age now I'd be giving it a 10/10. A pretty good casting and they hit all the right spots with the action. Still dont understand why the blue ranger drowned in 20 seconds but other than that things made sense and there was lot of comparisons to the original. They included the original ""go go power rangers"" song which was awesome. I would be lying if I said I didnt get a little bit excited about the mega Zord.Give it 6/10. I was going to be 5/10 but the mega Zord and the original theme song pushed the score up a bit.

I only watched Power Rangers a little bit when was younger and was never really into it, but, I got to say I was pleasantly surprised with this movie. I loved it, I think everyone involved did a very good job. There was a good mix of comedy, action, drama and even some sentimental moments.In the Cenozoic-era, six interplanetary warriors, the Power Rangers, are tasked with protecting life on Earth and the Zeo Crystal. The Green Ranger, Rita Repulsa, betrays them and plans to dominate the universe. Red Ranger orders Alpha 5 to perform a meteor strike that kills him and sends Rita to the bottom of the sea, foiling her scheme.In 21st century Angel Grove, high school football star Jason Scott is dismissed from the team and placed under house arrest after a failed prank. In school detention, he defends Billy from a bully, Billy offers to deactivate Jason's ankle monitor for help at an old gold mine that evening. Billy detonates explosives to break some rock, attracting the attention of Jason, Kimberly, and nearby students, Trini and Zack. The five discover the Power Coins and each take one. While escaping mine security, their car is hit by a train. The five find themselves at home the next morning and discover they have been granted superhuman abilities. Elsewhere, Rita's body is found. Waking, she goes on a rampage, hunting pieces of gold to raise her minion Goldar to find the Zeo Crystal. The five teenagers return to the mine and discover an ancient spaceship where they meet Alpha 5 and Zordon's consciousness. They inform the teenagers about the Rangers history and Rita, warning that they have eleven days until Rita has her full power, finds the Zeo Crystal, and uses it to destroy life on Earth. The five leave the ship with no intention of returning until Zordon pleads with Jason to convince the team.The five returned to train the next day, but they cannot morph. They spend the next week training against simulated Putties and trying unsuccessfully to morph. To inspire the Rangers, Alpha reveals the Zords. Zack takes his Zord out for a joyride and almost kills the other Rangers when he crashes it. This angers Jason, and they fight. While trying to separate the two, Billy spontaneously morphs. However, when he becomes conscious of it, the armor disappears. Angered at their lack of progress, Zordon dismisses the group. Jason returns to the ship to confront Zordon and discovers that once the Rangers morph, it will open the Morphing Grid and allow Zordon to restore himself in a physical body. Feeling betrayed, Jason accuses Zordon of using the team for his own benefit. The team camp at the mine and bond with each other.Later that night, Rita attacks Trini and orders her to bring the Rangers to the docks. Trini informs them about Rita and they arrive to fight, but are quickly defeated. Rita forces Billy to reveal the location of the Zeo Crystal, kills him, and releases the others. The Rangers take Billy's body to the ship and ask Zordon to resurrect him. The Rangers agree they would give their lives for each other and resolve to defeat Rita. In doing so, they unlock the Morphing Grid. Zordon revives Billy, sacrificing being able to restore his physical self. With the team restored and confident, the Rangers morph into their armor.Rita creates Goldar, raises an army of Putties, and attacks Angel Grove to find the Zeo Crystal. The Rangers battle the Putties and head to Angel Grove in their Zords. After the Rangers destroy the Putties, Goldar pushes the Rangers and their Zords into a fiery pit. In the pit, the Zords combine, forming the Megazord. Rita merges with Goldar. The Rangers battle and destroy Goldar. After refusing Jason's offer to surrender, a defiant Rita tells the Rangers that more will come for the crystal. In the end, Megazord slapped Rita into space. The Rangers are praised as local heroes, and with Rita's threats foiled, they return to their normal lives.",Power Rangers
150,cujoe_da_man,"Not terrible, could have been worse *minor spoilers*",7,30 September 2017,"Starting out, this is not me trying to convince other reviewers that they are wrong/right, I totally get where some are coming from. I actually picked this up for $3 at one of our local re-sellers and figured for that price, I would give it a try to at least say I watched it, that way I could justify my disgust for what they were doing with it.I was hyped to see they were going to do a bit more serious take on the Power Rangers, but when the first trailers came out, I was dead set on the idea that this movie would be a two hour 'teen angst' movie with maybe ten minutes of actual Power Rangers and five minutes of that ten would be them training.When I finally watched it, I actually found myself enjoying it.You have to look at it from my perspective, the trailers made it look like something straight out of a 90s teen movie and then suddenly you see them in their power suits. To say the trailers were cut terribly is an understatement, Jason especially. He's made out to be some dead beat jerk who doesn't give a crap about himself or others around him when the complete opposite is true. He was getting in trouble, but there is actually a reason for it.While I thought they could have found a different avenue for backstories of each character, I can definitely see why they went the way they did and to a point, it actually worked.A lot of people complain about the length of time you have to wait before you get to see any real action, but if they were true fans (as they say they are), they would know that is exactly how normal episodes were. You spent the first 3/4 of the episode setting up some plot with a possible subplot and the last 1/4 is a huge battle. It's just here, you have a much longer time to wait.The look of the Zords were OK, I still don't get why some had six legs, but I'll chalk that up to alien tech. It would have been nice to see a bit more traditional Megazord instead of a larger version of a Power Ranger, but it could have been so much worse.Overall, if you're just looking for a popcorn movie, this is certainly it. If you can look past some of the glaring plot issues (I'll get to that below) and just have fun with it, I recommend it. I can't say for certain if there will be a sequel(s), but I hope if they do that they learn from some of the mistakes and make it better. Besides, who doesn't want to see Lord Zedd on the big screen, aside from 1995...Ivan Ooze... bleh. -------Rant review (please take with a grain of salt):While I did, for the most part, enjoy watching this movie, that's not to say that it doesn't have its issues. The first and foremost is the cast itself. Some of the acting is kinda ""meh"", but considering how the original series went, I looked past it. What is worse is the HUGE amount of SJW/PC crap they had to throw into this. *Sarcasm Start* The black actor can't be the black ranger because that would be racist. The Asian character can't be yellow because that would be racist. The Asian character can't be female because, reasons. The black character has to be the smart one because it would be racist not to. Two female characters have to give off subtle 'lesbian' tones because that's how things are in the real world. Male characters have to be touchy-feely because gays need to be represented. I've seen much worse choices in movies (2015 Fantastic Four, anyone?), so it really didn't bother me too much, but it's definitely there. *Sarcasm End*The plot itself isn't too bad, but has some loose ends that are never tied up. They never truly explain the connection between the crystal and life and why it's important. They never explain how no one has ever found the coins or the ship OR the crystal, even though they're all only about ten feet underground. There's others, but I would be here all day writing about them.There is one scene in particular where Jason and Billy ""borrow"" borrow his mother's van and end up getting in a huge wreck. Later we are shown as the van is loaded onto the back of a wrecker, but you never find out if Billy's mom knows about it. They also never explain how they got home after the accident.Goldar's look was just absolute crap. It looked like gold crap, literally. Someone, when designing things, actually said ""we need Goldar to look like a jello mold with wings"" and others agreed. Goldar has been reduced to nothing more than a minion rather than a key ""sidekick"" character.Rita's back story is that she is a former green ranger, this does not sit well with me and many others because there is no reason for this. Had she killed the green ranger and taken his coin, I could definitely see a need for that, but I also figure that the coin should have rejected her because she is no longer ""worthy"" of the power, which is why the kids were chosen in the first place.I will give this movie credit for one thing, it's a step above Bayformers in that you actually feel a bit of a connection with the characters and you want them to succeed so they can win the day.These are my own personal opinions on the film and I hope they are treated as such. Be your own judge in the end and enjoy if you can.",Power Rangers
151,florisklaver76,A movie that could do no good.,5,30 June 2017,"We have to be realistic here, we all loved the Power Rangers when we were kids. But that's where the problem is as well, we liked it because we were kids. The show itself was actually very bad back in the 90s. For me, it has this cult status and I went to see this move expecting to see just that, a good action movie with a lot of cheesiness and cringe moments. For my personal taste this reboot is a bit too American Teenager. The build up is way too long, before they are actually the Power Rangers, there's only about half an hour left. The acting is quite bad at times but that does not come from the actors who play the Rangers. Overall it is enjoyable to watch and I think people scoring this lower than a 5 are not getting what the Power Rangers are about and have unrealistic expectations.",Power Rangers

Ahh the rose tints...It's actually a fun reboot. Solid effects across the board which you can't say of most of the current crop of super hero movies.There's some sludgy dialogue supporting the 'outcasts' for various reason ie your typical teen stuff.However, it mostly achieves its aim, admittedly a rather simplistic one, to entertain and it does that!

153,dothancore,"This ""movie"" remind me of the reboot of The Fantastic 4, only even worse",4,6 August 2017,"These are the ""Power Ranges""? LMAO ... I can only wish I have never seen this show. For straight two hours, what was shown on screen are not super hero stories, just 5 confused teens wandering around a small town doing a fight. There is not much a story line to begin with, awful acting all-around, no on-screen chemistry, not a single good fight scene. The dialogues were mostly at elementary school level, and the whole thing falls under typical Hollywood stereotypes. Neither the heroes nor the villain were convincing.I mean, there are plenty excellent super hero movies, Dark Knight, Deadpool, Wonder Woman, etc. A good director with creativity and imagination can create the dramatic effect in a super hero movie as strong as any other genres. It doesn't have to be shallow or dumb. But this ""Power Ranger"" movie has failed to present any shred of intelligence, dramatic scenes, or touching story. You simply can NOT relate to any of the characters. I can see the director was trying to be sleek (trance music), funny (talking robot), but he has achieved none of those. It really reminds me of the disaster reboot of The Fantastic Four, same BS straight out of studio with no imagination or too timid to try. I feel sorry for the true Power Rangers fans - what should have been a heroic story was turned into crap. Anyone over 14 years old with above average IQ should not have given this movie more than 4 starts.",Power Rangers

Billy made the scene funnier and livelier, while Zack brought element of surprise for every scene with his wild and crazy attitude)and how they introduce each one of them. I wish they can dig deeper of the character's background story. It was interesting and made me wonder what's next. What could they bring on to the table. Well, in the end i have to gave the score quite low because of the several scene and the ending made me so upset. Some of it is hardly acceptable not only because it's illogical but also silly.It seems forced and the story doesn't really well written, rushed, the problem (objective) in the movie was not clear, half- cooked if i may say. Also, you will find the product placement is strongly incorporated in this movie, it's kinds of annoying. I will say no more, since it's only my personal opinion and everyone has the right to indulged themselves in nostalgia (esp.for those who was born in 90s). I watched it with my friends and not everyone had the same opinion as mine. Some of them said it's quite good & entertaining.",Power Rangers
155,xgray-03873,Morphinomal!,8,9 April 2017,"Finally got a chance to watch this movie and I have to say, I'm actually impressed with this new revised beginning for the Power Rangers cinematic universe, hopefully. I don't see why anyone else can't actually enjoy this movie and have fun. Now, if I were to gripe on some things about the movie that I didn't like, besides the aesthetics of the ranger suits' designs, is the fight scene before the final showdown with Goldar, I feel like the moment was kind of ruined once the suits were reveal and when they played the Kanye West song during the fight scenes. Should've done better than that, Lionsgate and Saban. That and Kimberly's backstory in the movie. But yeah, acting-wise....this definitely a far better improvement over the acting from the TV show, especially with Elizabeth Banks as Rita Repulsa and the five main actors that were selected to play the iconic roles of Jason, Zack, Billy, Trini and Kimberly. These guys were literally nothing like the TV show counterparts at all, so there's absolutely no reason to comparing both version or the original 1995 movie to this movie at all. And I do mean that there are literally no comparisons at all. Bill Hader's Alpha 5 is actually warming up to me, but no one can top that of Richard Horvitz's Alpha 5, in my opinion. Same with Bryan Cranston's Zordon. He's okay, but honestly, Zordon's character in the show is much better.Overall, I actually had fun watching this movie and I believe that it's definitely worth a watch if you're a fan of Power Rangers or if you would like to see a newly revitalized version of the classical Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers TV show, but with a new twist. And it's definitely worth the watch.Thank you, Power Rangers and may the power protect you!!",Power Rangers

157,MaxHaydon1994,6/10,6,21 July 2017,"Like many I was excited for the Power Rangers film for nostalgic reasons. I did however have many reservations about the quality of the film. Was it going to be as cheesy and corny as the power rangers we saw as kids? the short answer is no. This film try's to mature with it's audience. Given the subject matter you'd have to say it's a tough task but if this film achieved anything i'd say it firmly achieved that.Having said that... the one place in the film we could have done with some immaturity was the humour. Something that fails miserably. There are many reference points, one of the main reference points being Marvel.Ironically it's a bit of that Marvel humour that was lacking. Now I'm not saying this should have been a copying anyone... but if we had just had a writer with a great sense of humour this film would have felt much more authentic.The sad thing is, the film started out interesting as well as funny. Billy (The Blue Ranger) was clearly the intended comic relief..and he was succeeding. But as the film went on... Billy's lines were drowned out by the rest of the characters who were too . It pains me to say that the blue ranger was the only character that had enough depth to like... the rest were either not likable by default/you weren't meant to like them. Or they were too basically written to feel a strong liking or disliking for them.The only possible exception to Billy as a source of comic relief was Bill Hader as Alpha 5, a clumsy looking robot. But again there were no real laugh out loud moments for me.Another strong appeal for me to watch this film was Bryan Cranston, who didn't disappoint in his role as Zordon. He gave the film a recognisable face, along with Elizabeth Banks who played Rita Repulsa. It was these noticeable faces that carried my interest for long enough to let the story take over. Unfortunately there's a lot of problems with the production of this film, many things could come under scrutiny. However there are many positives too and I would attempt to recommend this film without mentioning too many of the negatives. I give the film a 6/10 but would urge people to watch this film if they loved power rangers as a kid. because they'd probably take value from it as I have.",Power Rangers
158,luke_bale,Ignore the 1 star reviews,10,8 August 2017,"This movie does for Power Rangers, what the Xmen movies did for yellow spandex, or Batman begins did for the Batman movie franchise. It took something that worked on a campy comic book level and made it believable, no longer just aimed at children or teens. The character development for the first hour and a half makes the latter action and effects that much better.For those that moaned about a lack of action, my three year old stayed engaged throughout the character stuff at the start without whining and because it isn't done in the normal typical way the characters are actually engaging and fun to watch.I was blown away by the effects and the way they made brightly coloured suits and silly monsters look so good.The only thing I would agree with in some of the negative reviews is perhaps the film doesn't always convey the best messages for kids but that said I don't expect every teenager to go out and copy everything they see in a film.Take a chance on this, I had the lowest of expectations but was so impressed I hope this gets the recognition it deserves and a sequel to match!",Power Rangers
159,rs403404,Mighty Morphin' Krispy Kreme Rangers,6,8 April 2017,"By the time ""Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers"" went big, I was teenager. I have seen random episodes, but my primary takeaways from the series is that the characters don't have discernible personalities beyond being either the good guys or the bad guys, the Power Rangers are incapable of doing anything without a sound effect, the town of Angel Grove should be a battle ground-graveyard from all the Godzilla style battles, and, finally, the Pink Ranger is hot (highly important to teenage me).It's important to understand that I'm not approaching this movie with fond memories of the original. I try not to enter the theater with preconceived notions. However, I did not look forward to this movie- -at all. Bearing that in mind, I was shocked by how much this movie worked and how close it was to being something really special. I say close because some glaring issues held it back. First, the movie's few attempts at humor are cringeworthy. After a solid intro, we soon cut to a beastiality joke. It's a similar joke that worked in ""Kingpin"", but is out of place in this movie. Sadly, the remainder of the jokes play about as well.Second, when the Power Rangers actually become Power Rangers, the movie takes on the feel of a formulaic episode. They fight putties, then a big monster attacks Angel Grove which allows for a big mech vs monster battle. What's interesting is the movie is at it's strongest when we spend time with the title characters. The rangers are portrayed by likable, talented young actors. Consequently, what was a huge weakness for the source material is a strength here. Nevertheless, once the characters morph, that quality mostly disappears inside their costumes.However, that brings us to the third and most glaring major issue and it's not something I usually care about, but it's intense here-- product placement. Comparatively, ""Man of Steel""s placements of IHOPs were downright subtle when viewed alongside the appearances of Krispy Krème in this movie. The product placement first appears about halfway through, starts obvious and quickly becomes obnoxious throughout the remainder of the film. There's even a moment when the villainous Rita Repulsa takes time out of her battle to destroy the world to lovingly eat doughnuts. One can't help but wonder how much Krispy Krème paid for this? Is it possible they are the sole sponsor?These glaring flaws in the midst of what could have been a credible movie make ""Power Rangers"" feel like an opportunity lost. Still, the fact that it is as good as it is when it's based on a series like ""Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers"" must be viewed as something of a minor miracle.",Power Rangers

167,tyleramato-28680,Power Rangers v. Tone: Dawn of Inconsistency,4,25 March 2017,"""Power Rangers"" is yet another product of Hollywood's reboot machine which aims to take something silly and turn it into something grounded and gritty, but if you're gonna take something in a more serious direction, you damn well better stick to it, and tonally ""Power Rangers"" is a gigantic, if not somewhat enjoyable mess that tries to bite off more than it can chew. Power Rangers' biggest draw is easily its young and talented cast of colorful characters, including the once High School Football prodigy turned hooligan, Jason Scott played by Dacre Montgomery, the socially awkward Billy Cranston played by RJ Cyler, the mysterious Trini played by Becky G, the reckless Zack played by Ludi Lin, and resident bad girl, Kimberly Hart played by Naomi Scott. The five young actors have instant chemistry together and all have something different to offer to the film, Bryan Cranston also turns in a fantastic portrayal of Zordon, Bill Hader provides solid voice work for Alpha 5, and Elizabeth Banks chews up the scenery as main baddie Rita Repulsa, whose diabolical plan is to build a giant monster out of...gold? Called Goldar? To find a crystal buried under a Krispy Kreme in the town of Angel Grove? Sounds grounded and serious, doesn't it? And yes, you heard right, Krispy Kreme is an integral part to the film...totally not joking here, folks. It's a shame how well the first half of the film worked in contrast to its second half, but that's what happens when you have five different people working on the script.

172,nickijjohnson,Blast from the 90's Past,6,25 May 2017,Frankly I find it hilarious that this movie is getting such bad reviews. I didn't think it was any worse than the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles remake though I hated that remake because I loved the original so I suppose I could understand how die hard Power Ranger fans may have not liked it. I watched the show when I was little and I have to say quite frankly it was the updated version of the same crap to me. It was a little more Breakfast Club than the TV show was. In fact when I first saw the trailer I thought it was going to be a remake for The Breakfast Club. I've also read reviews with people complaining about the acting which I find even more hilarious because the acting in the TV show was so over the top overacting that I found the movie's actors to be the toned down versions. Even the over- acting of Elizabeth Banks was nothing compared to the actor who played her in the TV show. In the end when they all synced up is when it really reminded me of the show. It's unfortunate though that there's already been Transformers and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles because it comes off as a wannabe even though none of these movies are original. They're just regurgitated shadows of their former selves. Next up is Baywatch. Why don't they just do I Love Lucy while they're at it? Anyway entertaining enough and to me just the updated version. A more pleasant blast from the past than that Ninja Turtle or Ghostbusters crap.,Power Rangers
173,ddangtruong23,A Very Pleasant Surprise,7,3 August 2017,"Let me start off this review by admitting that I have never been a fan of Power Rangers, despite being a 90s kid. I started watching the show kind of late, and by then I was already old enough to realize that it was very repetitive and predictable. However, I'm actually glad that I am not a fan because it allows me to come into this movie with an open mind and not let nostalgia affects my review.And the reason I think it's important to keep an open mind is because this movie will not be what you expect it to be. It strays quite far from your typical Power Rangers shows, especially in terms of characterization. In this movie, the whole saving the world thing isn't the central point. Instead, the movie spends most of its run time on the teenagers themselves, exploring their personal lives and their relationships. And it didn't do a half-arsed job at that either. There are actually moments of clarity and connection that feel sincere. In fact, this one movie has more character development than hundreds of episodes of the show combined. And with that, the Power Rangers world suddenly becomes more realistic and interesting without having to go grim and dark to the point of ridiculousness like the new Fanstastic 4 did.On the other hand, it still manages to somewhat maintain the cheesy aspect of the original show. The main characters are still teenagers that do dumb teenage things every once in a while, and the giant robots and colorful armors that people love still remain intact, they just don't take center stage until the final third.Acting wise, I think the cast mostly did a good job. My only complaint is Elizabeth Banks's portrayal doesn't seem as complex and interesting as it should be, given the character's background. But maybe they was saving it for future sequel.All in all, I like the direction the franchise has taken and I really hope to see its sequels get made.",Power Rangers
174,submitme,"Decent start, and downhill from there. Bad CGI effects and not even funny.",4,10 July 2017,"The original cartoons from the 90's were bad, but this is sadly no better. Sadly the whole basis for the Power Rangers movie is awful, I mean, dinosaur like zords, combine into one megazord? If the story line and such had been tweaked to fit into a more modern movie age, I think that would have been better. But then of course you alienate any die-hard fans and wouldn't probably still have ended up with a bad movie. But I will say they were fairly true to the original cartoons, as far as I remember them.The movie started out ohkay, but it got progressively worse. I sort of liked the start and how things were introduced, but then as soon as they got their powers, literally hours after they woke up, they instantly changed their mindset, and threw them self of cliffs and what not. Having basically no regards for what could happen or if they would survive any mistakes if they fell. Seemed unrealistic, in a bad way.All the effects in the movie are really quite poor, the slow-mo, the zords looks like they don't fit into the environment in the movie. The other CGI in general never seem to be ""in focus"", maybe that's a cheap and easy way to skimp out on the quality by having the camera fly all over the place every second and be blurry to look at. The acting and the jokes/humor are just not quite there. And it were convenient that the big golden monster were just the same height as the megazord would be when combined.I didn't expect much from the movie, but I were still let down, and a bit over half way through, I started to feel like I just wanted the movie to be over with.

My wife told me that is the theme that was played in the old show. I was a power ranger toy boy not the show man so I didn't know. And for those of us out that both fan and casual viewer alike. This is exactly what you would expect from a TV show power ranger movie. I will start by saying all of the rangers, none of whom I have seen before, were great. As was Bryan Cranston as a hologram on a wall and Bill Hader as a robot. While I am a big fan of Elizabeth Banks, she was a strange choice for the bad guy. Also a shout out to Roy from the office as an angry dad who has a heart of gold and is just trying to do his best on deadliest catch.As a movie, it was nice to see something that could have turned into a punch fest as more of a character driven film. The rangers don't even get into their suits until almost the last thirty minutes of the film which would make sense since I think I heard they are planning five more movies after this one (something that makes me want to have a power ranger punch me in the spine). All of the characters are easily likable, and while a few of them don't get the same attention as the others, it is still a great team that is gathered.The action scenes were pretty cool but nothing we have not scene before. Again, this movie was obviously made for the same fans of every other reboot of that generation and I am sure many of them liked the movie, but when the rangers are just karate hi ya'ing around it doesn't impress me the same way as some of the better choreographed fights in other movies.Another issue I had was that I wish I could say this next sentence was a spoiler. All of them ride in dinosaur machines that then morph into a giant machine. This could have been a super cool scene but they show that in the trailer and take away any surprise that might have been there. Look all I am saying is if I had to choose between watching the Texas Rangers or the Power Rangers I would pick the former. If I had to choose between watching Walker Texas Ranger and the Power Rangers, it would depend on the episode. If you think I didn't try morphing all my neighbors power rangers trucks into one giant vehicle while they asked how I got into the house you would be wrong. This was an enjoyable movie, if you are a fan go see it. If you need a date movie I hope both of you are fans. If you need your Elizabeth Banks fix until Pitch Perfect 3, then go see it but just be warned she looks more like an Mayan Mummy or the Enchantress from Suicide Squad than anything else.",Power Rangers
176,pailoong,"People upset with a beastiality joke in this kids film, but...",8,23 March 2017,"... they're totally okay with ""Beauty and the Beast"", a movie where a girl falls in love with an actual beast. Also, to the tool who said that this film was made to jump on the Marvel superhero bandwagon: yes, I'm sure it has everything to do with that and not the millions of dollars that two movies that were rebooted from a cheesy 90's kids show made. Whatever. Anyway, got back from seeing this movie tonight and it was good nostalgic fun. It IS a Power Rangers film so if you're familiar at all with the source material you know to expect a little cheese. The liberal Hollywood crap is kept to a minimum (a character is made gay but this doesn't impact the story at all, so one can assume it's done only to put butts in the seats and not actually do anything meaningful or different with the character). There's a few instances of meta-humor which I'm a sucker for and I always enjoy (one such joke is in the previews). The action is exciting and the effects are top- notch, although I question some of the choices, namely the idea to turn Zordon into some kind of giant pin art toy. I felt longing for the giant head in the tube. Anyway, it's an entertaining film. If you're into pseudo-artistic Cannes Festival stuff, stay away from this film. If you want to go out and have some fun - especially if you were a fan of the show as a kid - then you'll enjoy this film.",Power Rangers
177,pefre-19402,More work,6,22 September 2017,I expected more from this movie but it didn't go so. The plot was centered too much on the teens that we forgot is a power rangers movie.The action scenes were little. We got to wait an hour or more to see our heroes in their suits only to are them fight briefly before activating their robots. It would have been beautiful if there was a stronger content.The movie would have been great if we saw more action scenes with the power rangers kicking tons and tons of the minions even before fighting the giant alien.,Power Rangers

179,LovecraftLass,I Loved It,10,3 January 2018,"I have to admit. I was a Power Rangers addict in my early to late teens. I first got hooked on it when I watched it with my nephew...and then without. When I had my son I refreshed my love of it. I don't pretend to be a Power Rangers expert but I have an abiding affection for it. So, it set my geeky little heart all a-flutter when I saw the trailer for it. It was also a good trailer. It showed just enough to make you want to see it and not too much.Power Rangers started in the early nineties (1993), ran for quite a few seasons and with different variations. The show itself was pretty basic. Some kind of monster would show up, the Rangers would morph, kick some bad guy butt, rinse and repeat. They did start adding a bit more story as the show went on but the formula remained pretty much the same. It caught some flack because some kids were trying out the moves on each other and it was ""extremely violent"". Never mind the fact that the show stressed teamwork, friendship and loyalty. I really wasn't expecting much, to be honest, even with the cool trailer. I was very pleasantly surprised. More than pleasantly surprised.I loved it.The story starts out normally. The usual detention Breakfast-Clubbers are thrown together by chance and after a mis-guided explosion at a gold mine they find the Power coins. That's when the fun begins. Afterwards they start noticing they've changed. They discover a buried spaceship, which tells them their purpose and what they've become. They are now the Power Rangers and have approximately eleven days to save their town (and the world) from Rita Repulsa, who (coincidentally) has also been re-awakened. Then the fun really startsThe acting was quite good, much better than I expected. The relationships were pretty realistically portrayed. They weren't instant friends nor instant antagonists. There was also no insta-love or love triangles for which I was profoundly grateful. There was also no petty bickering or cattiness between the two female leads which was very refreshing.There were a few cheesy moments but I expected a little cheese and it was good cheese. The difference between generic slices and real chedddar.There were some very unexpected twists and parts that actually surprised me. I mean, really surprised me. I'd love to say more but why spoil it for you?One thing I'd also like to mention is that the PG-13 guideline is well-earned. There were some moments that were very intense and one or two made me cringe a bit. Not cringe, as in it's terrible and hokey, but a cringe as in it was a little hard to watch.And the villain? I'm not going to say much but don't go in expecting the doofy Rita Repulsa of old. This chick is scary. And pretty awesome looking.There were many a part that made my geeky little heart flutter. There were a few in-jokes here and there that were balanced perfectly. Not too many, so as to make it nothing but referential humor. The dramatic parts were balanced quite well with the more comedic and action parts. I was afraid it would go 'Godzilla' on me. Too many people, not enough action.I was a tad bit leery early on with the way a couple of the car chase scenes were shot. They were very choppy and quick so I was worried that the action sequences would be the same. I needn't have worried. They were great! I loved The Zords. If there hadn't been people sitting in front of me I may have squeed a bit. I may have anyways.In wrap-up it was an awesome nostalgia to indulge in with my son. It's always nice to have a nerd-out together every now and then. For younger viewers some of the scenes might be a bit too intense, though.",Power Rangers
180,Skaigear,"If you are a Power Rangers fan, you should still check it out, it is not perfect movie, but it was fun.",7,17 June 2017,"Power Rangers is the latest movie reboot of a property from the 90's following Transformers, G.I. Joes and plethora of others. It is directed by Dean Israelite and written by John Gatins. Israelite's last film, Project Almanac was an okay movie, but I felt he nailed something really well and that was the chemistry between its teenage protagonists. He once again was able to get that right with Power Rangers as the Rangers themselves here are the best thing about the movie. All of them were really good and charismatic, including someone you would not expect like pop star Becky G who plays Trini. My personal favorite was Zack the Black Ranger played by Chinese Canadian actor, Ludi Lin. I felt he had the most screen presence and charm out of the five and was the most interesting character-wise, even though he by far had the least amount of screen time. Not sure if it was only me, but Ludi Lin seemed like he did not get much close-up shots in the movie, like the editor was afraid of showing an Asian male face to an audience. As filmmakers, we know that close-ups can connect the viewers with the character further, and Ludi in spite of not receiving much of this in the film, was still able to become the most fascinating character in my opinion is simply remarkable.This is a movie I truly wanted to love, as I am someone who loved Power Rangers as a kid and waited a long time to see a masculine Asian American male superhero on screen. It succeeded somewhat on both. The truth is the film is very uneven, with lots of contrivances and conveniences to get from point to point. You can call it fate, but I do not like how the five heroes were able to meet one another and find the coins just because they were in the right place at the right time. Because literally anyone could become a Power Ranger if they just happen to stumble across a coin. Jason, just because he picked the red coin unknowingly becomes the leader of the group, despite displaying no leadership skill on screen. His relationship with Kimberly and Billy is solid, but he has zero connection with Trini, and his rivalry with Zack was half-baked, and could have been expanded upon more before the tension-boiled fight they got into. The reason they all agreed to train as Power Rangers was also not very convincing. Instead of just a vision of an impending attack, I believe they should have awakened Rita earlier in the film to wreak havoc in Angel Grove to bring tangibility and gravity to the protagonists' choices. Rita being fished up by the fisher boat at the same time the teenagers find the coins, waking up Zordon to inform them they need to train for Rita is just way too timely in my opinion. The movie is filled with these dumb plot points that at first viewing might be okay, but on repeat viewings you start to see how bogged down things are.As I mentioned, the best thing about the movie are the characters, particularly the Rangers before they morph. You can really feel the young cast members are friends in real life because it definitely shows on screen. My favorite is the Zack-Trini relationship even with given limited screen time. Bryan Cranston was good as a floating head Zordon, lending his voice and likeness to the film brings some prestige to the picture. Bill Hader as the voice of Alpha-5 was funny, but not much else. The best of the well-known cast is Elizabeth Banks, who in her early scenes was scary and intimidating like something out of a horror movie. She chews up the scenery every moment she gets, and I loved it.The last act of the movie we finally have the Rangers morph into their armors. This was the segment that was marketed a lot in the advertisement campaigns, but if you are going into the movie looking for that crazy Transformers-action, you will be sorely disappointed. The Rangers only morph once, and they stay in the suit for a total of five minutes, before getting into their Zords and fighting the rest of the final battle. I really want to love this act, but to me, it was kind of empty. The build-up to the morphing scene while long-winded, was a bit unearned and artificial. It was like the movie was staring at its watch and realized ""Oh crap, we only have 30 minutes left till the credits, quick get the kids in the suits!"" The CGI for the final battle while good, was not great either. And the tension was non-existent because we all know Goldar was not going to kill any of the Rangers.Power Rangers overall is a fun movie, but I wish it was something more, as it was my most anticipated movie of 2017, instead it was just good. Stifled by plot contrivances and uneven pacing, the script could have used some doctoring by a more singular vision. What we got here is in the first two acts, a superhero version of Breakfast Club, filled with characters who are likable and charming with chemistry with one another, and a final act for the young children in the theater who did not give a darn about character development. If you are a Power Rangers fan, you should still check it out, it is not perfect movie, but it was fun.",Power Rangers
181,Bosco-HK,How True is this Long-Awaited Reboot,5,26 March 2017,"I grew up watching Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers! Ever since the several ""movie versions"", I was waiting for this reboot as a movie from the Original 1993 TV Series. If I remembered correctly, this reboot was even ""slightly"" delayed. This review contains spoilers, kindly continue at your own discretion. ---Pros:I appreciated the portrayal of ethnicity (as many as possible), gender, (and even included orientation in the essence of the characters).Starring Dacre Montgomery as Jason/Red, Naomi Scott as Kimberly/Pink, Becky G. as Trini/Yellow, RJ Cyler as Billy/Blue, and Ludi Lin as Zack/Black. From one end of the world to the other, covering several different continents.I most enjoyed is Naomi Scott. Even as Pink, I felt like she played ""the backbone"" of the team especially during the handling of the Zords. Despite as much as having some cultural diversity, with the actors and actresses representing, the attempt to portray ""physique"" was probably too tough when comparing to what I remember from the Original 1993-96 TV Series.The next favorite of all the characters, is Rita Repulsa (Elizabeth Banks).What I mean by ""physique"" is not just trying to match ""body type"" to be just like the Original 1993 series. Over the course of training, we can see that Kimberly (Naomi Scott) showed more ""artistry"" and ""put effort in training"" from her ""cool tough shoulder-to-headshot"" which I really liked. I think it is due to Kimberly, bringing out her gymnastic background to show signs of physique or an all-around athlete. And even Trini was the next quick learner even though she was the one to show her speed in climbing from the side effects (a reference to Sabretooth), and then Kimberly caught up and even beat Zack to the top. Most likely intentional that the ladies were presented to be better than the guys (yet to see their stories for physique), which gets my thumbs up!This is not a con of the movie but the ability to do that ""huge leap"" was a little bit awkward but a reference to ""Superman/Hulk/Spiderman/etc""? I must say though, portraying the two ladies (both Trini and Kimberly) to be awesome at their landing. I laughed at the three guys who had their ""trouble"" with their ""leap"".I like how though that ""the battle phases"" were short sticking true that good vs evil, it is always ""practically easy for the good"" to win. However, as far as ""origins"" or ""starting from fresh"", I think the battle phases could be longer or put more difficulty. We cannot forget about cameos! Amy Jo Johnson (Kimberly/Pink) and Jason David Frank (Tommy/Green/White, or later Red and ""Professor"" at one point in each respective TV series).On the other side, Elizabeth Banks as Rita, indeed quite marvelous. Of course, her tag line ""Make My Monster Grow"" was included in an okay fashion but I guess the original was just an exaggeration and ""perhaps the final decision"" was just to go with ""a literal aspect?""---Cons:I feel like the cons in any review should first be reviewed based on the limitations of movie length. By that, movies have been gradually reduced in duration, now almost all of them vary between 1 hour 20 minutes and 2 hour 20 minutes, or otherwise taken to ""Part 2"" rather than ""sequel"".Before I really go ""in somewhat order of occurrence"", I guess they tried to do it like you know ""when after several episodes you don't really need to see the entire Megazord transformation"", this 2017 reboot did that for the ""Go Go Power Rangers..."" song. I was actually very happy that they brought it in but then decided to use ""a technique in TV Series"" rather than playing the entire thing out and jump ""almost straight into action"" which is another film technique. Still, I would have preferred to have heard the entirety of the song, since they obviously took out the ""cheesy Morphin'"" with the ""Morphers"" or ""some sort of hand-held equipment to morph"". Another very notable downfall was ""using techniques"" to save a life. I think I don't have to say much more about that. This is before going back to HQ.What I felt was ""the meeting of characters was too rushed at the ""Saturday detention"". Detention, I believe it is a reference to ""The Breakfast Club"" (1985), by all means not even close, I found ""The Slap"", extremely funny, clearly girly for an outstanding quarterback (QB).I understand that each character was showcased in a rather stereotypical manner from the beginning, I still think we can have more character focus. Perhaps, kept for sequels to tie in ""friendship"" or ""history of connection"" for future characters who will become Rangers or ""fit for being a Ranger because they were, for example, training partners or like a father's friend's son or like someone who long disappeared or that they left behind after ""moving"".Back to the battle phases, perhaps length-limiting though unsure, ""the discovery of combining into the Megazord"" was ""way too rushed"" just as they are about to lose. And then that ""backdrop suplex?"", not a ""special move"" at all but simply from ""training"", as ""the surprise factor"" over an opponent now wielding a long-reach weapon. Anyway, for better or worse, all the ""cheesy"" stuff made it ""rather adolescent"" resulting to a ""degrading effect"" in terms of ""what is known with a reboot"". From ""The Slap at Detention"", to ""Trini's water bottle"", to at the very end where Rita exclaimed ""How?!"" was extra comical, bringing back the exaggeration lost in ""Make My Monster Grow"", perhaps ""The Second Slap"" turned out to reference ""why Rita and Gang were to be at the Moon Palace""?I think it is good to stop here, to avoid seeming as though I am a 110%- perfect writer or director. I hope some of you may find the above long- windedness ""up to standard"".",Power Rangers
182,darkguardian-99861,Better than I expected,7,29 December 2018,"I watched recently this movie and I have heard that it wasn't that good. However, upon watching it I was surprised; The movie is based a bit more on the drama of each character's everyday life, as well as the interactions between the group rather than the fighting. There is action in the movie and it's got quite good choreography.If I have a grip with the movie, is that it's called ""Power Rangers"", meaning it's based on a show known for its fights and this movie's action comes quite late and at a small amount. Also, the timing of some stuff, like the arrival of the Megazord is weird.To conclude, the movie is quite good with solid acting and pacing, but it loses points due to the fact that it's based on a TV show.

I love the twist, and the signs of positive diversity with switching around the races of the characters.

190,zordmaker,"Dragged, Screaming, into the 21st Century at last!",7,25 March 2017,"OK. First lets set the stage. I worked on the first (1995) Power Rangers movie, creating the zords and a fair bit of the art department wizardry. Power Rangers goes back a long way for me, having not just been a mad fan of the show but also having been given the opportunity to shape and mould that PR universe of long ago.So it was indeed with apprehension that I entered a darkened theater 22 years later to sit and watch what they have now done to our little baby that started it all. Along with my 13 year old daughter who'se name is unashamedly Kimberley.Right away the opening scene had me hooked. This film is very much a complete re imagining of the concept from scratch. It has little to do with the past. It's dark and gritty.. but not too dark and gritty. It goes to great lengths to explain character back story which is something most MMPR fans would know featured as a glaring absence in previous work with this property.There were a lot of our original rules that this film breaks. Initially I feared this would doom Power Rangers, as it has done many other superhero film ""reboots"" of late who chose not to stay faithful to original concepts and designs.Our rule about not seeing the face of morphed rangers - broken. But in it's place, finally.. an explanation as to what ""being a Ranger"" really IS all about.This film is daring in design. It will delight ALL traditional fans AND new viewers. In many ways this is the Power Rangers film we always wished we could have made back in 1995 had we been given the chance or the time.This film works. It makes sense. Before long I stopped caring about the differences between new and old and became immersed in this 21st century version. Yes Alpha looks terrible - but sounds fantastic. And yes, the 21st Century rangers DO look much better than our 20th century attempts.Yes I had to pinch myself a few times when the third act played out almost exactly the same way as our original did.""Power Rangers"" is a great film for today. It stands on it's own feet. I am happy to see that Junior has finally grown up. Anyone who knows me will tell you I'm a hard nut to crack, especially when it comes to something as close to me as Power Rangers.However this film cracks that nut with ease. It sets us up for multiple sequel opportunities and no doubt will spawn a new found interest both in new and old by most who see it. There's some genuinely new concepts in there and finally, some respect for the strong characters that captured so many fans of the original both young and old.The only thing missing from this film is (perhaps) more of the morphed Rangers, which we don't see until the third act begins. The villain (Rita) is perhaps a little too dark and no match for Paul Freeman's delightful and witty ""Ivan Ooze"" in our original. Her minions (affectionately known as putties) are little more than copies of our own ""rock creatures"" from 1995 and really not much of a match for the new Rangers.The opening scene (set in the distant past) clearly show both Zordon and Rita are naked after their armor is released and yet for the Rangers we still see the armor built over the top of their street clothes. It's a shame this mystery of the ""morphing process"" built into the opening scene couldn't be extended into the all important creation of the new rangers a millennia or so later.Ultimately and despite the radical departure from our original designs, I enjoyed this Power Rangers reboot, as did ""Kimberley"". I find my old ""ranger fandom"" given a new boost of energy in this version and look forward to the next chapter in the MMPR story.And finally, I sit satisfied that the new film dared not to create a new Megazord Cockpit, choosing instead to leave the rangers in their own zord cockpits when the giant is formed.I guess they just can't improve on perfection, eh?",Power Rangers
191,adean81,Power Rangers Review,7,15 April 2017,"Since I was a big fan of the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers as a kid, I was super excited to see the new movie. While this movie does change a lot of things from the original TV show, it creates a new mythology of the Power Rangers that is refreshing and well explained. Even though the rangers don't get their suits until the end, the movie does a great job at setting up the characters.Most of the movie is establishing each of the rangers and the issues they are struggling with as individuals. It takes a surprise twist towards the end of the movie to bring the team together and gain their power suits. Which look pretty great in the action scenes. A few of the zords are hard to make out what they are supposed to be, the best one is the pink rangers pterodactyl zord. The big battle ending was a pretty good fight and there were a few great nods to the original series, that made the kid in me squeal. Although the movie wasn't all good, there were a few weaknesses. While the action sequences are great it doesn't occur until late into the film. Some of the jokes are kind of tasteless and don't land very well. The last thing is the villain, Rita Repulsa. In the beginning, she looks very creepy and the movie uses elements of horror. Unfortunately, this tone is not consistent with the character throughout, and not really consistent with the tone of the movie. While this isn't a great movie, it was pretty much what I expected and did what I wanted it to do. The opening scene was a pleasant surprise and most of the movie is good. This movie sets up everything perfectly for a sequel, that hopefully will have the rangers uses their suits and zords more often. If you're coming into this looking for the show then you're going to be disappointed. However, if you can get over that idea, then you might be surprised by some of the original aspects this movie has to offer.",Power Rangers

194,BrBaFett,Had me on an emotional roller coaster.,10,24 March 2017,"I grew up a die-hard Power Ranger fan. I thought at first it was cheezy with the story behind the Power Rangers, Zordon once the Red Ranger and the fictional language that was being spoken. Liked the idea of detention, but I feel they could've done better introducing the Rangers before hand. Wasn't high on the casting choices either; my favourite was RJ Cyler as Billy because I think he portrayed it so well, liked the version of Trini, but still think casting could've been better. Didn't like the version of Rita Repulsa because in the show Rita is a witch with a team of villains, but all she has from them in this movie is-- literally--GOLDar... which is probably what else made me mad. Alpha, I could live with, kinda liked that version. But still wish they had the actual Command Center as a headquarters. Like Bryan Cranston as Zordon was awesome. But later towards the end is where I started to tear up. I liked their morphing sequence--that was my favourite part of the entire show. Then after seeing the zords was just unbelievably awesome while playing the Power Rangers theme song. If you watch the show, you'll understand these 100%. I liked how they had all the Power Ranger cameos, such as Jason's dad saying, 'Mariner Bay and Reefside.' Old ficitonal cities from the TV show in other seasons: my jaw dropped. The fight scenes with the zords and Goldar were so well done, just would've rather seen a megazord transformation and although was impressed with the morphing sequence, I wish they did it better. I cried towards the end when I saw (Jason David Frank and Amy Jo Johnson) Tommy and Kimberly's cameo, then seeing after the credits hearing the name 'Tommy Oliver,' my mind officially went super positive.

Bryan Cranston is reduced as an pixel heap on a screen and came only for the paycheck I guess.
Don't expect some good characters developments, after all it's the director of Project X. Concerning direction, a lot of scenes are filmed too close to the actors.
We have to wait until lhe last fourth of the movie to finally see the heroes wearing their armours. Until then, it's quite boring. I laughed at one scene at the end of the final battle (which reminds me of Pokemon the series), then it's followed by a cringeworthy sequence which is meant to be cool, but fails I guess.Verdict : 4/10

197,edgeoflight,A Pain to Watch,1,22 July 2017,"I shook my head so much in this movie that I began suffering from wry neck. The movie is unbelievably painful to watch. The beginning seemed good to be honest, but as the minutes went by and the plot unraveled (like a thread) I found myself disturbed and feeling uncomfortable watching the movie.The acting goes from acceptable but nothing more to incredibly dull and B-movie status.The CGI is ugly and overused, even the people fleeing in the finale were green screened cgi. They could at least have made it seem more real. The Power Rangers series was 0 CGI at the time. This movie is a fraud as a Power Rangers movie.The pace is horrible; they talk 90% of the movie and when they do nothing interesting, challenging, emotional (not cheesy) or sensible comes out of their mouths. Only pitiful lines, blank-filling idiotic screams, or obvious remarks.The villain overdoes it and is really pathetic. The costumes are nothing like Power Rangers, and the Zords were dull.Honestly I don't even want to go on with all that's bad and disgraceful in the movie. I could mention the horrible finale, the appalling soundtrack (Kanye West please), and so(ooooo) on but I will leave that to other reviewers. I just cannot.This movie had no colors, no fantasy, no nostalgia, no creativity (imagine). It was distilled ugliness. Watch at your own peril, but you'll need therapy afterwards to get rid of the memory of such a flop.",Power Rangers
198,dietaube,Shallow but entertaining,6,6 November 2017,"Those who just want to see Power Ranger Morphin Time and some action will be fine with this. I certainly was very entertained. And they even tried to give each of them a backstory and something unique - except the yellow ranger girl, who is so amazingly plane with no real issues or character trades except to be the gay one. Having a loving family must be hard on her... The girls in this movie are really left out and even totally look the same. The first 20 Minutes I actually thought they would be one and the same person. Both dark hair, same length, same eye color, same pretty face. I was actually confused when the five of them stood together and asked myself ""Who is that other girl!?"" She just appears out of nowhere without character introduction whatsoever. The movie does a good job combining cool looks and usual Power Ranger cheese. No masterpiece but quite entertaining.",Power Rangers

With that being said, I'll get straight to the review.Whether you are ""young"" (people ranging from toddlers to 20+ year-olds), or an adult who watched Power Rangers with their kid, you will probably like this movie! Is it anything ""new"" or special; no, but it's an entertaining movie all the same. It's a lot like the first installment of most Marvel movies: Iron Man (1), Captain America: The First Avenger, Ant-Man, etc (roughly the first half of the movie is all about the superhero(s) learning to use their powers/learning to BE heroes). It's mainly story-driven, but it's got plenty of action! If you're looking for an Oscar-winning movie (like Lincoln, King's Speech, etc), you're not gonna find it here; however, if you're into action-packed superhero movies with (dumb teenage) comedy sprinkled in, AND you grew up with Power Rangers, you'll love this movie!",Power Rangers

202,jasonsharden,If Michael Bay Had Heart,6,9 April 2017,"Dean Israelite's ""Power Rangers"" reboot is a worthy addition to the ""Power Rangers"" saga despite its flaws and shortcomings. It stays true to the spirit of the series, and allows itself to be serious during certain aspects of the film in order to have a deeper look into the Rangers lives as teens. It takes maybe TOO much of its time building up the characters, but it's worth it in the end since it allows them to get to know each other, thus making their bond believable as well as relatable. If you're worried the film tries to take itself too seriously, worry no more. It has plenty of cheese reminiscent of the series in regards to the jokes, the acting, and situations. The casting is fresh with its array of new talent playing the Rangers, accompanied by Bryan Cranston's solid portrayal as Zordon, and Elizabeth Banks' near perfect performance as Rita. It's campy, it has lots of heart, and it makes for a fantastically fun and nostalgic cinematic experience.",Power Rangers

It genuinely made me laugh at points, sometimes intentional and sometimes just because I couldn't believe what was happening on screen.

204,recca01982,A complete and udder (but NOT!) let down. Avoid it.,1,30 June 2017,"I will be completely honest here. This movie,... I went into with little to no hope for. I've seen the trailers, seen the leaks and heard friends who saw it in theaters. This movie was garbage. Going into it expecting the awesome rangers I grew up with, was my own fault, I will freely admit that.But let's start it out with how they started the movie. Within the first five minutes there's an implied moment where a GENIUS of a friend to Jason ""milked"" a male ""cow"". Let's go ahead and ignore that the supposed leader of the power rangers was committing a crime. Then proceeds to follow up said crime by running from the cops in a twisting camera of nausea. He then avoids the police and gets into a car accident, and proceeds to blame the freaking world over his issues by,.... BEING ANGST FILLED.To be honest, around this time I wanted to turn it off. The acting was pretty poor in terms of quality, and the interactions if you could call it that, were few and far definitely meant only to try to make a sense of teamwork that wasn't there.I could go on and on to nit pick this whole movie apart with how poop filled it was. But I'll simply leave it with these points.Action 1.5/5 - Few and far between. There's maybe two action scenes,... one in the ""pit"" (a safe place for the teens to train against things that would otherwise KILL them), and the end of the movie where it's painful to even watch. The CG of this fight is cringe worthy for 2017, and their one liners are completely ridiculous.Comedy 1.5/5 - This movie tried to make humor in EVERY situation it could. Which lead to some seriously bad timing in terms of lead up. Such as fighting for the life of the universe. It was unnecessary considering it TRIED to make itself super dark in terms of the movie.Plot 2.5/5 - Typical plot, not good or bad, it's power rangers.Overall, a complete avoid. I'm kind of upset I paid $4 for this movie, and it isn't a rental so I can't get rid of it from my digital library.",Power Rangers
205,CallMeAi,Never been into Power Rangers,9,30 May 2019,I wasn't into Power Rangers growing up but I decided to watch this. And I really liked it. Surprisingly more than I would have thought I would. I think this is a very good movie to watch if you're a new fan. This movie is so emotional and it's really good. I especially love the character developments and I just wish there was a second movie.,Power Rangers
206,jaidanh,Not the ideally Power Rangers movie any fan would want,3,3 March 2021,"The majority of this Power Rangers movie is just some teen angst drama. Now I have nothing against teen angst being portrayed in film and TV. But we're talking about a Power Rangers movie. This movie tries too hard to be serious and mature. There's humor every once in a while, but it doesn't fit with the serious tone. And while we're on the subject of seriousness, the color palette used in this film is very dull. It's the same washed-out color palette used in Man of Steel and Fantastic Four, which has been used in so many movies, and it's completely outdated.The script is quite bland with several pop-culture references. Some of the dialogue can be inappropriate for the kids that watch this film.The acting is okay, but the characters have feeble character development and can be very unlikeable. The most likable characters I can think of are Jason and Billy. Other than that, there's not a lot of characterization for the heroes of this movie. I wouldn't consider them fit to be role models. The Rangers don't have strong chemistry with each other. In the original TV show, they were already friends before becoming the Power Rangers. In this film, since they're only meeting each other for the first time, they fail to build a connection and understand each other. Even Zordon can be seen as unlikeable. In this film, he can sound irritable, whereas Zordon in the original show was more optimistic.Some aspects in this film are just stolen from The Breakfast Club. I'm not saying that because the film opens with a detention scene. There's way more than that. For starters, the Power Rangers all follow the same character traits as the main characters in The Breakfast Club: The Nerd (Billy), the Jock (Jason), the Outcast (Trini), the Princess (Kimberly), and the Rebel (Zack). The campfire scene where the Power Rangers reveal bits about themselves is similar to The Breakfast Club's circle confession.One of the BIGGEST issues I have with this film is the mass product placement from Krispy Kreme. My god, it's everywhere between the middle and end of the film. The final battle literally takes place at a local Krispy Kreme.Speaking of the final battle, it's the ONLY fight scene in this 2-hour movie. If you were expecting this movie to be packed with fighting sequences, get ready to be disappointed.So yeah, I wasn't entirely pleased with this film. It doesn't have much replay value, and I wouldn't recommend this film to kids. I liked the visual effects and the soundtrack, but yeah, that's about it. This film was just very uninteresting. Hopefully, the next reboot does something much better.",Power Rangers

My siblings and I grew up with Power Rangers, we were so hooked up on them to the point that our parents found it to be a serious issue but Power Rangers was a great childhood experience.This reboot movie is long, boring and not nostalgic. OK, I get that they were doing a ""re-imagine"" version of the kids show but it was poorly executed and the movie is dark and serious?? Gtfo with that sht! The characters: Jason is a reckless loser, Kimberly is a secret btch, Zack is...I don't even know, I'll give Billy a pass since he's autistic, Trini is a troubled, angry, lesbian/bisexual punk, *sigh* whatever and Zordon is a DICK! These characters are uninspiring. The actors had no chemistry, they were bland, boring and ungathered. The movie spent most of the time introducing the characters who/what they are and then in the last 30 minutes of the film for their first battle as the Power Rangers everything is rushed.""Oh but this is an origin film"" I Don't CARE!! Guardians of the Galaxy was also an origin film for the team and they were written properly.Power Rangers suit looked cool but the Zords? The only zords I noticed was Jason's and Kim's but what are Zack, Billy and Trini zords suppose to be? And the zords assembled out of nowhere with the Megazord looking like Optimus Prime and the CGI sucked.The putties looked like ""The Thing"" from that crappy reboot Fantastic Four 2015 film, Goldar looked like a walking golden liquid T-1000.

This movie was beyond corny and with an extremely unorganized plot. I found all of the Power Ranger actors/actresses to be horrible at acting and shouldn't quit there Day jobs. I found the whole movie just really bad and that was extremely disappointing to me. I really was hoping to be blown away and that definitely did not happen...

THis seemed like one long Krispy Kreme commercial so that's where the budget came from for this mess. If I were them I would ask for my money back. Yuk. Some of the kids had acting skills and a great look but beyond a video game like look and feel it was just a video game that you are not allowed to play in or a marketing ad that just runs continuously as a marketing ploy for toys maybe? It missed the mark as a movie by as much as a movie could miss the mark. I was excited to see it and then in short order I regretted the choice. Stuck in there till the end but it was not fun. This may be a fun escape for young kids but as a movie it seems like a group of different people with differing views on how the story should go were involved. Instead of breaking out a list of flaws and errors lets just say this was not for me and I just don't see how these people that made this thought they did it right? Sad.

211,Sabre-El,Quite an amazing movie for what it is,9,25 September 2019,"This is one of those cases which shows that movie ratings do not represent reality. To me, this movie offers so much given the type of movie it is meant to be. It's not meant to be serious, it's not meant to be dramatic. It's just meant to be a renewed version of the old TV series. And it delivers on that.The movie follows the protagonists' to becoming Power Rangers and almost two-thirds of the movie is dedicated to that. The pace during this time is quite good. Everything, from the graphics to the directing and acting (not so much, but it gets a pass as these aren't well-known actors) is top notch.The last third of the story is a bit rushed, but is still fulfilling. The villain's motivations are not so clear, and the same can be said about their powers. But this is Power Rangers; what do we even expect?All in all, a very decent modern take on the Power Rangers. One can see that the film-makers have tried their best to add as many throw-backs as they could. I'm not that big a fan of them, but I got to say that this actually ranks as one of the movies that I had fun watching this year.

The Power Rangers movie is meant to be colorful, fun, cheesy and action packed. This one takes itself way too seriously and does not work. The characters are all boring and so stereotypical. The zords, costumes, Alpha are all poorly designed and terrible. The Krispy Kreme product placement is way over the top, you think Krispy Kreme funded this movie.

214,blueclementinex,it's what you've already expected....,6,26 March 2017,"so, i just watched power rangers movie, and i say that all my expectations are fulfilled. to start it off, as a kid i love power rangers, and i almost watched every episodes of it. as a teenager, however i love to make fun of how campy and ridiculous it is, and when i first heard of this movie, my expectations are pretty much low. i mean, come on, just based on the source material which is a very dull (yet funny in a way) it's not like i'm walking to the movie expecting a cinematic masterpiece. first of all, i'm just going to say that, yes, the CGI is no better than what you've seen in the trailer. it's that stupid, but as in what the movie is targeted (which are for the younger audiences ) it's pretty forgivable. although i'm not that sure because sometimes the scenes are way too creepy for the younger audiences, and some of the jokes are pretty mature as well. but it's not the main issue though, because i think it's trying to show that the movie is trying to entertain everybody (which often fails, though).but one of my main issue with this movie is the performances. i'm serious, it's so bad that it becomes an entertainment. there's this particular scene that supposed to be sad and emotional yet somehow left me laughing because the actors literally show no expression to show so but only teary eyes. some of the actors's line delivery are so forced that it came out very funny. Elizabeth banks is so bad that it's embarrassing to watch her. and this bad acting doesn't stop there, it is completed with bad script. i mean, sure i guess you want to make a script that is easy to understand, but it doesn't mean that it has to be that dumb. i mean, seriously, the combination of these two disastrous elements somehow remind of SUICIDE SQUAD. at first, i'm not that sure then there's this scene where they talked about their feelings and their stories but it's so forced, unrealistic, bland, and bad-performed, that suddenly remind me of that bar scene in suicide squad- where every character tries to talk their insecurities and stories to developed the characters but failed, and it happened in this movie, but worse because the actors are way worse than suicide squad. but, rather than trashing this movie, i would like to say a few good things about it, like the score and soundtrack . i mean i'm not saying it's a good score (trust me, in the battle scene where the climax of the movie happened, the music plays the power rangers theme song for a second, cut to a new shot, a second or so after the new shot they played a tense music all of the sudden (which not just bad-placed but very hilarious) , but i really appreciate that the score and soundtrack's shows some similarities with what the show's score and soundtrack. because at some scene, it felt pretty nostalgic to the show. the fight scene is also very ridiculous, but it's ridiculous in a way that we can appreciate it, especially the fans of the shows because believe me, if you watch this movie and thought the fight scenes are dumb, you clearly haven't watch the show's fight scenes. overall, i really recommend you to watch this movie if you're just looking for a popcorn fun, blockbuster movie but don't expect anything bigger than what it's already appears to be.6/10",Power Rangers

I didn't expect it to be any good, but this was way below my expectations. It was basically a ripoff of an episode of the original series, although drawn out to feature length it followed the exact same pattern:1. Some backstory 2. Go to Zordon's and get a mission 3. Fail mission due to being tricked by Rita 4. Back to Zordon's and moan a little, have a deep talk etc. 5. Get strength from Zordon 6. Fight 7. Get Zords 8. Fight some more but still not good enough 9. Transform to Mega Zord a.k.a. OptimusEven as a kid I was annoyed that pretty much all the episodes followed this pattern, and seeing it now for two hours was not only a waste of money (I rented it), but a waste of all I can think of really. The ""action"" sequences seemed like they were cut directly from the TV show, and although the CGI is way better than it was in TV back then, by today's standards it's awful.And.. why devote 1,5 hours to a backstory that is not even well written? And.. why did the movie lose all of its remaining dignity once they finally were able to morph? Oh, yeah! They threw the Power Rangers theme song into the action sequence.................

I am 21 years old Born 1996, And i grew up with power rangers from Mighty Morphin all the way to Mystic Forces only ever skipping Spd (idk why) But i Love them even now i still watch the older ones from time to time. i have read some of the other comments and yes i do agree that some aspects of the movie are not ideal for children, because thats what this movie is, just like the superhero genre older people who grew up with them are saying that it's too childish, while other (that i agree with) say some scenes were really thought out for this particular genre e.g Cow,car chase, ankle bracelet etc but, i honestly was so keen for this, but after a few trailers i kinda lost hope, i finally got around to watching it, and although at first i was a bit Effie on some particular scenes and changes but i found myself loving the movie, it brought back old memories of when i first watched them, the graphics were great, the characters/actors were great, rita was so different but awesome and i would love to see more, lord z, Rito, Bulk & Skull! Tommy's transaction from evil green to good green to good white,the ninja zords, Ivan ooze, the swap to rocky, adam ,aisha and eventually kat, even if they carried over to Zeo, turbo and space (as my favorite apart from MM) i know its has a lot of differences from the original some good some bad, and if they stopped the inappropriate scenes, i really think in time it could end up being a great movie series for a new generation of kids to watch and for older people to bring up old memories, as that i have tried watching the new TV power rangers but in my opinion they just aren't as good as the older ones but hey, the kids must still love them, i know this wasn't that much of a review on the movie itself but i think there was a few good point, sorry if i offended anyone p.s gotta love Amy and Jason's appearance at the end, 5 power rangers and 2 appearances as rangers in super power beat down and Jason is still hanging on gotta love it :)",Power Rangers

Like I said, not a fan, the series missed my demographic when it came out but I knew the gist of it. The movie gives some back story as to how the Rangers came to Earth and also to the individual characters which gave the movie some heft. The Rangers alter egos have personality instead of the squeaky clean drones on the TV show. Also, hits all the buttons-training sequence, bonding scenes, slow mo hero walk (I think we get two). Brian Cranston has a good, almost cameo, essentially a face on a wall thru' the movie. Violent fights but no blood and the characters stop just short of vulgar language, had no problem letting my son watch.

219,crazybilby,Fun but stupid,4,10 January 2018,"There's a certain struggle when it comes to adapting children's media for an audience that has all grown up and willing to indulge in some updated nostalgia. This film will satisfy some and annoy others because of how it tries to capture this nostalgia.My favourite part of this film is Billy - the black autistic Blue Power Ranger. His autistic tendencies aren't shown as a burden, he's accepted by his team, and overall he's a loveable and endearing character. It's so good to see such positive representation in a blockbuster film.Let me say that the initial set up of the film is a good reason to force a writer to think about characterisation. The film forces the characters to reveal things about each other to overcome their inability to function as a team and we see them flesh them out a little - but only a little. This is a good idea done poorly.Now there are moments that are genuinely really fun. You need to go into this movie expecting some silly action adventure because... well it's Power Rangers. This isn't art cinema. This is people in suits attack faceless monsters. And that's part of where it also dips down in enjoyability. The villain has all the same corny two-dimensional silliness of the children's show origins. That's what I meant by nostalgia dragging it down. The first act seems to all about putting a modern look and feel to the main characters and setting, setting up plot and characterisation, and then the subsequent acts go ""eh, whatever"" and it devolves into this increasingly poorly written mess of bad dialogue, uninteresting villain, and over simplistic conflict resolution. It plays out how you'd expect it to play out: like a Power Rangers episode stretched out over 2 hours. In trying to remain faithful to the corny feel of the original it splits itself tonally between the serious first act where troubled teens are conflicted about being thrust together and the final stages of a maniacal cartoon villain (who the actress I'm sure is thankful her face is covered in prosthetics so she isn't so easily recognised and won't have her career dragged down by a ridiculous performance).That's the issue with this film: it has sporadic moments of fun and good ideas but gets progressively worse the further into it you go. For some fans it is a worthwhile watch. But I feel the amount of fans who think its worth a 2nd watch are noticeably fewer.",Power Rangers

I thought the actors were alright, and did OK for a bunch of mature teenagers. BUT the story was a bit sloppy. Background knowlage on characters was a bit poor and many random characters would often randomly pop out in the film, such as the Father, a few random police men, The old Red Leader, and the robot (Its bad when you can't remember any of their names). In all honesty Transformers is better. The graphical quality is NOT as good and it has a very Spy Kids kind of feel 2001 PC Graphics feel if I am honest. Many things in the story are NOT explained clearly either. Not saying due to spoilers, but big things that make you wonder why they are so important, or how something happened. It genuinely could of been such a better film and it really missed a good opportunity. If you want to see this film I STRONGLY recommend borrowing it off a friend or rent it out. Not really worth £10 in my opinion.",Power Rangers
222,jvm0393,"A forgettable film based on a stupid kids show, advertising donuts.",4,14 April 2018,"The 2017 Power Rangers film based off the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers TV show which in itself is based off the Japanese TV Series (Super Sentai) is a bit of a letdown to say the least. The film is partly inspired by the 2015 short film of the same name which was a gritty and dark retelling of the classic TV show. The 2017 version does start pretty similar to the 2015 with nearly all of the rangers getting killed off by Rita Repulsa with Zordon hiding the power crystals from Rita's grasp. This scene is then ruined by the next scene when our main hero (Jason later the Red Ranger) sneaks a cow into his school only to then realize it's a bull and then shows us (the audience) that yes this is indeed a bull by flashing the light at its genitals. The indecisive tone of this film is one of the many problems it has, in one moment it's trying to be serious but because it's aim towards kids as well as a PG-13 rating the seriousness of the scene is altered. Not only that but the Power Rangers are barely in the film, you only see glimpses of them until the climax of the film, most of the time we are focus on five teenagers whom stumble upon five glowing rocks things which will morph them into Power Rangers (once you get past the boring training montage). The only redeeming quality that this movie has is the cast, they do pretty well with what they are given however their backstories slow the film down to a snail's pace.It doesn't get any better once the five of the main protagonists become power rangers, as the next 20 minutes becomes a commercial for Krispy Kremes as Rita Repulsa is creating her giant monster made out of gold using a power crystal conveniently located underneath a Krispy Kremes store. I was struggling to hold back laughter hearing the rangers along with Repulsa repeatedly saying Krispy Kremes. You know this film is bad when the film becomes a commercial. I wasn't expecting a masterpiece when I watch this film at the cinemas last year but I was expected this to be at least entertaining. Say what you like about the Mighty Morphin TV show but at least that had more to do with Power Rangers then this film and also didn't become a stupid donut ad at the end. The film fails in every single way, from the confusing plot to the bad pacing to the clunky combat scenes. It's trying to appease to both Children and people like myself who use to enjoy the TV show, however I don't think anybody would enjoy it, as one Reviewer puts it ""Too stupid for adults, to boring for kids."" In conclusion if you're a fan of Power Rangers and want to see, watch the Mighty Morphin TV show it's dumb but it's charming unlike this which is forgettable.",Power Rangers

One thing I have loved about Mist if not all films is those films who make one patient for the action. One that takes time in character development, story, etc. when the rangers finally morphed it felt like I was 6 years old again watching the various power rangers series and movies. The films made one care for everyone who was tasked with being a ranger. That way when they finally have to fight Rita you feel as though you are there fighting right along side them.",Power Rangers

The fact that a movie has action in all the scenes does not make it good, on the contrary, it makes it monotonous, so it should have more dramatic scenes to make the thrilling ones more exciting.To conclude, as part of the '90's generation that looked at the original version, isn't a bad movie, has entertaining moments and is good option to relax.",Power Rangers

I remember watching the trailer for the original MMPR as a child, hooked immediately as everyone else was. 3 things sold this. Teenagers that become super-hero ninjas, giant metal monsters the size of Godzilla and heavy metal.If you are into music at all you have come to grips with what is the most intense music, so be it, heavy metal.The film is about kids that are outcasts. Um, have you seen a meme with a heavy metal kid? Who is more of an outcast than one of these kids? By the time they are in their giant metal monsters aka Zords, we are presented with a very cheesy version of the original theme, that is much more awesome and intense than what we were given. What was that? It comes across as a slap in the face more than a 'shot out'.Taking away the metal is like taking away the armor and the giant metal monster battles. It didn't intensify, it watered it down. I don't know what kind of suburban mom music qualifying group you have behind this, but it's time you fire them.I would like you to check out an example of what this could've been like by looking up the score for Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance or Doom (2016).I would've given this thing a 10 had they paid any attention to what they were hearing whilst taking notes on the show, just as much as they did when they watched it with their eyes.",Power Rangers

Not everyone is a melodramatic whiner that has these Hollywood cliche problems. (He said after whining about the movie)All that aside, it took forever for the real power ranger action to happen. The movie was like; 1hr 45mins of teenage drama then finally some power ranger action which did not follow the same serious tone the rest of the movie had.

232,NewGirlNickMiller,"Fun, but not great.",7,30 November 2018,"Everyone that is writing a negative review of this film is saying that it didn't live up to expectations, ruined their nostalgia, was boring, was stupid, etc. So let's address some of that.Didn't live up to expectations:
If you're going into this movie expecting something amazing and ground-breaking, you're going to have a bad time. If you're expecting something more like Transformers, you'll have fun.Ruined nostalgia:
Nostalgia is a self-ruiner. Nothing ever lives up to what you remember when you were a wide-eyed child filled with wonder. Let's face it. Power Rangers was a really dumb kid's show even back then. We all just think it was baller, because we were kids when it was airing.Boring:
Some say it was boring, and I'll admit it was slow to start. It took a while to get it's stride, but if you can stick it out, it's a pretty fun movie.Stupid:
This movie has all the teenage high schooler tropes. I mean, you would almost think it were a modern day John Hughes film in the first half hour or so, because god is it tropey. That's okay though. I feel like the production team did this on purpose. This film doesn't take itself that seriously, really.My take on it is that it was fun. There were parts where I cringed. There were parts where I wanted to just shut it off. I'm glad I stuck it out, because it's not a terrible film as long as you're not expecting something on the level of Hitchcock.

235,AlexFalzon,Power Rangers - Can't decide whether it wants to be taken seriously.,4,23 March 2017,"The new Power Rangers film features very little morphin' and is not exactly mighty.I should mention that the ""original"" (virtually all of the action sequences were actually stock footage from the Japanese Super Sentai) Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers was my favourite show between the ages of two and five. Believe it or not, though, I actually haven't watched this children's show in many years, so I can't really speak as to the film's loyalty to the source material.What I can say is that liberties have been taken with the characters' backstories, but the main personal attributes seem to be intact, and I had no problem with the changes. Trini (the yellow ranger) is gay, now, and Billy is ""on the spectrum"", but these changes merely gave depth to characters who really only existed as obvious stereotypes in the original series, and I liked that.I have to say that I did find it quite amusing that they make a big deal out of announcing every single character's full name in the final scene, but omit Trini's surname. Billy's mother calls out all of the other rangers' full names, and ends with ""and Trini!"" I can only assume that it's because in the show, her last name was Kwan, and the new actress, Becky G, is of Mexican descent. Just call her Kwan or give her a different name, good lord. Even funnier, in the end- credits every single actor playing a ranger's parent is credited with their character's name, except Trini's parents, who are credited as ""Trini's Dad"" and ""Trini's Mom"".The film stars the aforementioned Becky G, as well as her four team-mates played by Dacre Montgomery, Naomi Scott, RJ Cyler, and Ludi Lin. I assumed all five were American (only two are), so flawless were their accents. They all deliver solid performances, with Montgomery and Cyler the only ones required by the screenplay to do any real acting. Bryan Cranston and Elizabeth Banks join the cast as the team's mentor and antagonist, respectively. Both are great, obviously, though seem to think themselves in an entirely different film than the main five. The tone of these two characters, both in dialogue and delivery, clashes crazily against the other five. It was probably intentional, but it was weird. There are certain extreme moments of melodrama sandwiched between scenes of cheesiness that just feel out-of-place, too.So in the movie the five teenagers with attitude (sadly, or perhaps thankfully, they are not referred to as such in the film) come across a mysterious rock and a strange cave, waking up the next morning with superpowers. They reunite and try to work out what's going on while familiarising themselves with their new abilities. If this sounds familiar, that's because it's basically the plot of Chronicle. Funnily enough, the writer of that film, Max Landis, was actually at one point attached to this movie, but is no longer credited. Weird.Five writers (count them), however, are credited. As often happens with films with a large number of writers, the script feels somewhat off. We begin with a coincidence that feels more lazy than anything; at the exact moment the five obtain their new powers, the antagonist's ""dead"" body is accidentally caught in a fishing net. For an even worse coincidence within a coincidence, the captain of that boat happens to be the father of one of the rangers. Of course.It's director Dean Israelite's second film, and I don't think his direction left much to be desired. His first film was Project Almanac, and I preferred Power Rangers over that one, The score is solid, the soundtrack pretty hit-and-miss. The editing is a little disappointing at times; we only see the rangers morph once, and it's not a very comprehensive look that we get. Also, Jason appears to pull a sword from nowhere and then we get a scene of him returning it to the space-ship later. Not sure what happened there. The action's decent, but we only get to it in the final twenty minutes of the film, and I mean that literally. There's no end-of-act-1 skirmish; the bad guys simply attack at the end of the movie.One other thing I find mildly irritating was the rangers' helmets retracting around their faces whenever they spoke. I guess the intentional might've been to make them feel more like relatable people and less like faceless drones, but it just came across as a lazy way to give the actors more face-time – which is silly, because, as I said, they only morph the one time. We've seen their faces plenty.The red ranger drives a red Ford Ranger, that was kind of cute. Certainly more subtle than when that same ranger hurls a Camaro at a bad guy and yells ""sorry, Bumblebee!"". Man, that moment was a funny little jab at the Transformers franchise; why'd you have to go and ruin it by playing Captain Obvious? The first song over the credits is the same as in the original film from 1995, so that was a nice reference, but I think I would've preferred the opening theme to the television show. That theme only plays once in the whole film, and is horribly misused. It only plays for a few seconds, and only the main chorus. Where's the build up!? You need to work up to it, you don't just blare it out for a second and then end it before we even realise it's playinghttp://alexfalzon.com/power-rangers/ - for more reviews.",Power Rangers

237,Damien_King86,"Not a brilliant reboot, but pretty good nostalgic entertainment.",7,29 June 2017,"I am rating this movie as an adaptation of a popular kid's show, keeping in mind the demographic and source material. The Pros: - The actors all fit their roles well, and the acting itself is mostly solid, which makes for likable characters. The Power Ranger suits and Zords are pretty awesome. Somehow the designs are both modern and retro in one package. The original theme song is included in an epic scene of the Zords headed out to battle. Also, the music in general is really cool, especially the synth-heavy tracks. The rangers themselves are mostly developed characters. The ""Breakfast Club"" dynamic of having troubled teens befriend each other really works for this story. I dig it. Bonus but unimportant: both female rangers are exceptionally attractive. The Cons: - It does take some time before the Rangers go into action, but that's not uncommon for an origin story. Rita Repulsa's character is not that effective. She is not villainous or interesting enough to be a compelling threat to the Rangers. Which leads me toElizabeth Banks does not have the bearing of a villain. Her voice and mannerisms as Rita do not elevate the material to any degree. This character is obviously a challenge, but I think another actress would have done it better.The action scenes range from pretty cool to a bit iffy, especially near the end. It's not a consistent quality of action compared to Transformers (but, my god, who can compare to Michael Bay's one-note brilliance of destruction?)The script could use a little Marvel magic. It has a few witty moments, but it falters into triteness pretty often. Also, why does Rita use modern idioms when she is not steeped in Earth culture?What Could Have Made It Better?A more mature script. Sure, there are curse words aplenty, but the actual conversations need improving, especially in the first scenes with Zordon and the rangers where Alpha 5 tries to explain how they are ""teenagers"", as if the obviously anthropomorphic Zordon would not realize this. The action and editing need improving quite a bit for a true blockbuster feel. Ironically, the old shows have some pretty dynamic editing and scenes given their resources, and that over the top feeling is part of the Power Rangers which needs to be incorporated.",Power Rangers

And...Krispy Kreme?,5,2 April 2017,"I went in to the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers reboot with trepidation as to how my beloved childhood property would fare in the hands of Hollywood, as there have been many franchises of late that have been rebooted to dismal failure (I'm looking at you Transformers). Despite this concern, I left the theatre uplifted that I had seen a very good film, not a groundbreaking one, but certainly an enjoyable ride. The vast majority of this 120 minute picture is essentially a paint by numbers origin story, however, this is exactly what we were all expecting, and the producers knew this as well, refining the tropes of an origin story to mould the films greatest strengths. For example, the characters are successfully introduced and well developed here with standout performances from RJ Cyler, Dacre Montgomery and Naomi Scott giving their A game, who along with the other rangers grow together as a family throughout the course of the film, leading to a believable dynamic between them and no ridiculously undercooked dialogue (I'm looking at you Diablo from Suicide Squad) when emotions expectedly run high. The CGI isn't revolutionary, but serves its purpose well enough, and the action is fast, fluid and engaging when it arrives. However, Inevitably I also have issues with the film, more specifically with how there is a significant lack of story here, seemingly sacrificed for a focus on character development; Rita Repulsa, the main antagonist, being torn straight from the original TV show and distractingly juxtaposing the other characters' grounded realism, the many mindless, faceless foes the Rangers battle through, laughably in-your-face product placement, and the film's abstinence from action set pieces relived only during the final 30 minutes of the film that seriously impacts upon its rewatchability. However, in conclusion, despite the film's many mishaps it is still an extremely fun time with great action set pieces and performances, which awoke all of my nostalgia and had me leaving the theatre singing the original Power Rangers theme song all day long. ⚡️",Power Rangers

I will admit right now, if you have ZERO EXPERIENCE with power rangers in any way, shape, or form then there might be some slight confusion. But, honestly the movie I feel does a great job of explaining everything! It's just, if you have the experience it greatly enhances the movie viewing experience.Now, I have read some movie reviews of this, and one reviewer in particular lamented (hated) the fact that the characters don't morph until the last act. Like, this is legit an over two hour long movie and it shows. But, at the same time the pacing is done extremely well! Hell, the beginning of the movie we are introduced to Jason, who is apparently pulling a prank involving a cow? Because LOL Who knows why. Best funniest scene in the movie to me is this, but specifically when the cops show up they all are like OH CRAP. Yes. EVEN THE COW PULLS AN OH CRAP LOOKSee, because this is a movie (one with a long run time which helps!) we, as a viewing audience, are allowed to experience more of the backstory of these characters. They are fleshed out, some more than others. (cough billy cough) Actually right now I'm gonna point out two gripes I have with the movie. Really the only two I have.1: The characters that have ""issues"" (trini being gay, billy being an autistic) aren't actually Referenced in the movie. Its as if they show evidence that ""yes"" there is something going on here, but its not DIRECTLY pointed out. I mean okay yeah, one of the characters being bi/lesbian/whatever should probably be kept more on the down-low, lest we get complaints from parents. But why not Billy? Why not have him explain what he actually suffers from? Because, if he is autistic? Dudes the highest functioning autistic I've ever seen. Personally, I believe he suffers from something else. Similar to autism, but different. Maybe Aspergers? 2: HUGE Deus Ex Machina. Basically the entire thing with the zords randomly becoming the megazord for seemingly no reason? Idk i guess the zords maybe did it themselves out of self-preservation.So, besides that this movie ticks off various boxes for current gen action/adventure films WITHOUT being boring.Basically to more fully understand it, watch the movie.

Scarlet Johansson/Black Widow (which I really like as an actor) and Jeremy Renner/Hawkeye? Have you seen any of the actors/characters of Suicide Squad (except maybe Harley Quinn) ?

246,Jarl86,Loved it!,8,31 March 2017,"Disclaimer: I'm 30 years old, grew up with Mighty Morphin PR, but the TV channel that aired it took it off after the first 3 seasons, I never had experience with newer iterations of the show until this year, in which I watch the entire marathon that Twitch was streaming. I owned the Zord play set that combined into the Megazord and everything. Actual die-hard fan.Going into this movie, I had a little prior knowledge. I knew it was an origin story, so I did not expect it to show a lot of suit/zord action, and from the trailer and spoiler-free reviews I saw, I did not expect it to be as campy as the show was. First of all, the Rangers themselves impressed me a lot, all of them. There's enough family drama there that I hope modern kids can relate to, especially peer expectations and even those with disabilities. Billy having mild autism was a pretty brilliant move on the writers part. But what sold me on them was that I knew nothing about any of the actors. All unfamiliar to me, and it made it a lot easier to let the movie sell their personality traits to me. I always identified most with Jason as a kid, not his physique or looks, but his attitude. Protective, caring and responsible. My current self likes this Jason a lot more. As the movie developed though, RJ Cyler steals every scene with all 5 on screen. He's lovable, dorky and heartwarming, and every bit as excited about being a Ranger as any kid would be. The ladies I struggled a bit more with. I didn't really feel they got the same family portrayal that the guys did. I hope as we get more movies (and we know we will get more), they build more on the less showcased Rangers Zack, Kim and Trini. I assume if they introduce Tommy in the next and keep to the character development from the show, we'll learn more about Kim through Tommy.When it comes to Rita, I have mixed feelings. She started out legitimately scary, but devolved into semi-comical as the movie went on. Show-Rita was never a ranger, and Rita being the earlier Green really ties into the creation of Tommy, versus the candle-magic we're accustomed to.Once the Rangers actually get a hold of their zords, man does the movie kick off into every nerd fantasy a MMPR-fan like myself could have. The fighting choreo is clever, each of the Rangers have their own style that matches the zord-characteristic. I still wonder what kind of zord Zack has. The other 4 have the same ones from the show, but that really did not look like a mastodon :p And my god the Megazord. It was everything I always wanted the original to be. Instead of all 5 suddenly appearing in a shared control room, each cockpit was strategically placed to the limb each controlled. And the Pterodactyl turned into useful swords this time, instead of that chest plate I always felt was a little weird.As for plot execution, already in the mention of the crystal Rita is chasing can you tell Saban has planned for many future movies. I've heard the script for 6 movies are mostly finished, but the fact that the Zeocrystal is already mentioned hints that they are aiming to carry the Ranger legacy on, maybe even past these 5. I feel they could have been a little more mysterious as to Ritas plans beyond assembling Goldar. And thin as it was, I did not mind the way they played off the look of the zords. The show never told us why they were mainly dinosaurs, so the ""they take the form of the most powerful animals on the planet at the time"" thing was a clever one. Also might hint that they evolve in later movies, rather than be replaced.What pulls the movie down for me.. PRODUCT PLACEMENT! Goddamnit Saban. I think the movie aimed to make us all fat, stereotypical cops the way they literally showed Krispy Kreme down our throat. The number of name drops, glaring neon signs of the logo or Rita literally eating a donut as Goldar is tearing up the building around her. It took me out of the movie every time and annoyed the hell out of me.I would also have appreciated them paying more respect to the original soundtrack. The themesong for MMPR the series is one of the most iconic for 90s TV, and the movie treats us to a remix of it.. for barely 10 seconds, the first time we see the zords in action. If you are going to be campy with one-liners (""It's morphin' time"" ""Make my monster grow""), please be campy and blast the theme song during combat. The soundtrack was far from bad, a lot of radio hits and familiar tunes that I bet kids/teens today are really into, but the old ""Go, go Power Rangers!"" is still very much popular.In conclusion: I had a great time. I enjoyed most, if not all, characters, the combat was solid. Solid character development for the Rangers, although there's a lot more to be shown there. if you are a fan like me, you will appreciate the nods to the show (Cameo by OG Kim and Tommy after the final fight), if you are not you might just appreciate it for the action-drama it is, though the action starts a bit later than most movies in the same genre does.",Power Rangers
247,Stootomlin,A fun and silly film. It's just what you expect it will be.,6,27 March 2017,"Remember I'm reviewing the film, not the memory of your childhood!!I'm struggling to pick a 6 or a 7, it's somewhere between the two, so I'm going to err on the side of caution and say it hasn't quite made it to the heady heights of a 7 out of 10.Let's start with the fact that I never watched Power Rangers. I was born in 1981 and when Power Rangers came over to the UK in about '95-'96 I was more interested in girls, and getting drunk (yes, I know how old I was). That being said, I was aware of it as a phenomenon, just not one I ever engaged with. I have a very similar relationship with Pokémon.This film is almost exactly what you'd expect from throwing $100,000,000 at a Power Rangers movie. You have some good actors, some pretty good effects, a better quality of costumes, but, an average script and story.The one thing I will admit, is that in not knowing Power Rangers all that well, there may be some inside jokes, or hat tips that I missed. I needed my wife to explain the little post credit scene, so I'm fully aware that my knowledge on the subject is limited.I'm also not sure if this film is supposed to be taken seriously or not. Is it poking fun at itself? Does it think it's a 'proper' superhero movie? I've seen it, and I honestly don't know.I will say that I loved the Blue Ranger Billy, played by RJ Cyler, he's on the autistic spectrum, and in a similar way to Sheldon in The Big Bang Theory, he's the constant flash of humour, he changed the flow of scenes in a wonderful way, he said inappropriate things at inappropriate moments, I don't know if he was like that in the series, but either way he was great, and I enjoyed the character and the performance.As for the other Rangers, the leader Jason (Red) was a little dull, they tried to give him a bad guy image but I don't think it really worked, and if he had gone missing after an hour I'm not sure I'd have missed him all that much. Zack the Black Ranger was quirky, a bit of a loon, yet at the same time rather sweet. Then we have the two female Rangers Kimberly (Pink) and Trini (Yellow). These two probably had the best back stories. I felt their faults were real, they were interesting. Kimberly is a typical popular high school girl, but one who's hurt some of her fellow students, and is struggling with her actions. Trini's had a tough home life, moving around a lot, never being able to fit in. I liked the fact that they tried to make these characters real, tried to make them relevant.Elizabeth Banks plays Rita Repulsa our baddie. I'm a fan of Banks in general, but this was a pretty crappy character. Saying that, from what I'm told, crappy bad guys is a consistent theme for the Power Rangers, so perhaps it was befitting. I don't think she herself was at fault, I just don't think she had a lot to work with.This is a fun and silly film. It's not hard to follow. Don't worry if, like me, you weren't a fan of the series, or again like me, you don't really know that much about it when going in, the story isn't going to be so complex that you feel lost. If it is? I suggest that you never vote, have children, and think about taking some night classes. I'd also suggest that you don't use any sharp scissors.If you grew up with the Power Rangers, you'll probably love this, and if that's the case I don't really feel that I can write a fair review for you guys. I guess, the people I'm writing for are people like me, who are judging this on its own merits, as a standalone film, and for you guys, it's okay. I'm not going to tell friends and family to go and see this like I have with other films, but, at the same time, if they're going to see it, I wouldn't tell them not to. It's not awful, it's just not great either. It's exactly what you'd expect a silver screen version of the Power Rangers to be like.",Power Rangers
248,Lord-Bigglesworth,For a minute there I thought it was going to be a good movie,5,10 July 2017,"The dramatic elements of this film, the character development, the dialogue, and even the acting were all surprisingly great. The issues the characters had with themselves and with each other were believable and very well-developed. Dialogue was a surprising strength, as was the acting. The actor playing Billy was a particular stand-out. Rarely do we see the highly intellectual character, with some form of autism and inability to socialize normally, to be portrayed so convincingly without over-doing it.However, by about the half-way point of the film, the developmental aspects of the film start to overplay their hand and you find yourself wishing the film would just get on with it. Yes, the character building is intriguing and well-done, but... this is film about giant robots fighting giant monsters. Frankly, all that exposition and build-up would've been worth it if the third act had been better handled. The director's strengths become obvious once the action lets loose. His/her strengths are in drama, not so much in handling large-scale scenes of mass- destruction. (I'm purposefully not looking up his/her film history until I'm done putting my thoughts out here.)I'm also a little mixed on Elizabeth Banks. I'm a huge fan of hers but her performance felt a little off-base; however, I'm not sure that's entirely her fault. This film wants to play the whole thing pretty seriously. Which worked with the Power Rangers, the super powers, the robot, and the talking head in the wall. But Rita seems to be uncomfortably stuck between the gleeful ridiculousness of the show and the ""dark and serious"" tone the movie is going for. The film clearly wants her to be treated as a legitimate threat, but it's hard to take anything she does seriously.All in all, a film that started off promisingly but ended without fulfilling any of those promises. Not terrible, but not good either. Like Rita, this film is stuck between the two.",Power Rangers
249,AaronDSimpson,Rangers Reborn!,6,3 July 2017,"It has been a long time coming in contemporary film, but we've finally arrived at a point where directors no longer feel the need to cast baby-faced thirty-somethings as high-schoolers. Despite concerns from producers over the decades that younger actors are less experienced and might not act as well as their older counterparts, it seems that someone in Hollywood has realised that they aren't convincing us that any of them are under thirty-five. Power Rangers, however, boasts an average age of twenty four and, even then, it is only Black Ranger, Ludi Lin, throwing off the statistics at age thirty-three. If there is nothing else about this film that you could take away and tell your friends, at least you've got young-adult acting done by those that know it best.Often when films are remade and franchises are revived it can turn out badly for the original, as Clash of the Titans (2010) and Carrie (2003) can attest. Yet, in other occasions it can turn out brilliantly and revive latent passions and childhood excitement, such as with Rise of... and Dawn of the Planet of the Apes in 2011 and 2014 respectively - ignoring, of course, Tim Burton's hash in 2001. Going into Power Rangers, knowing the thin line between failure and success and looking forward to reliving the experience of Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie (1997) and Might Morphin' Power Rangers: The Movie (1995), I found the reboot to be the perfect blend of cheese and modernisation. After all, it is a great strength of a remake to honour the legacy that precedes it whilst taking the franchise forward into a relevant direction.The rangers; Jason, Kimberly, Billy, Zack, and Trini meet one another during detention where each of them are revealed to be troubled and, partly, misunderstood teens. Red Ranger, Jason, has ruined his chances of a football scholarship when a prank involving the school's mascot goes wrong. Blue Ranger, Billy, is struggling with Autism after the death of his father, and the Yellow Ranger, Trini, struggles with sexuality and identity under the pressures of her normative family. The majority of the film is spent nurturing their character arcs and developing, what appears to be, an origin story for the rangers. Whilst dynamic characters are always cherished in films, it is slightly to the film's discredit that this process takes so long as action scenes are rushed into the ending almost as if Israelite were trying to fill Saban's quota of heroism. That being said, the interpersonal relationships that dominate the early parts of the film are what make it unrecognisable from a Power Rangers movie and this isn't entirely a detriment. There are no cringe-worthy martial arts, power stances, or badly sewn costumes, instead - meeting with the new requirements for superheroes - five regular kids that stumble across their powers. Whilst Billy is messing around in the gold quarry, a detonation goes wrong and the explosion reveals an alien rock from which Zack extracts the power 'coins' whilst attempting to find something valuable.After meeting Alpha-5 (Hader), a robot much like B.E.N. from Treasure Planet (2002) in both mannerism and appearance, and a digitised Zordon (Cranston) beneath the quarry in an episode of upside-down water reminiscent of Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007), the pace of the film quickly increases. The transition from rangers who were struggling to morph and couldn't defeat the simulated soldiers in training were suddenly fully-suited and riding Zords into Angel Grove to defeat Goldar. All of the success in creating a modern and respectable Power Rangers, impervious to instant dating is slightly reduced at the appearance of Rita Repulsa (Banks), who's make-up is an insult to make-up artists everywhere. You might argue that her static character, simplistic villainy, and antiquated costume is an aspect of the original that demands a place in the remake, her character is something of an eye-sore compared to the refreshing rangers. Considering the lengths gone to humanise the rangers and, to some extent, Zordon, it is disappointing that Repulsa has been neglected in this respect. The reality is that her only saving grace is her unawareness of Krispy Kreme - a brand that appears so centrally you might wonder about their contribution to the production - which offers a cheap comic thrill throughout.The crowning moment of the film, and the final nod to the original, is during the action sequence where the rangers are racing in their Zords back to Angel Grove and the original theme tune occupies the channels. For some, this is an act of unforgivable cringe but, for me, I was privately filled with child-like wonder and an overwhelming wish that I could be a power ranger - Any of the colours would have done in that moment. Even the 'boss fight' between the Rita/Goldar hybrid and the Megazord did not compare. The process of the Zords becoming the Megazord a little too similar to Transformers, which Israelite must of realised considering the Easter egg which features Bumblebee parked in the street during the battle.The film can be considered a success for the hardcore fan-base of the Power Rangers series as it does a commendable job of modernising the franchise and making it relevant to a new audience. However, for new viewers, there are going to be moments of confusion as to whether you're watching The Avengers, or Transformers and poses the threat of being a flash-in-the-pan, definitely entertaining during the two hours you're watching it, but not something that you're going to remember the details of two weeks later.Despite institutions like Forbes reporting that a sequel is unlikely, the plot has been engineered with a follow-up in mind.

250,kunal_0019,Could have been better,5,22 June 2017,"They had a very nice platform and with the current advancement in graphics they certainly had an advantage over the predecessor. That being said, the movie was poorly executed. Yes, they stunts are good, fx is amazing but there was a lack of story altogether. It's like things were not in a thread, they were all over the place. Well for a one time watch for a fan its not bad. But I expected something more this time. Hope this helps :)",Power Rangers
251,joelhbk,"Fun, exciting and fairly satisfying",8,24 March 2017,"Don't go in expecting top notch acting, effects or writing. This movie was never meant to be an example of film making excellence. It's a great teen movie. It combines elements of the drama kids go through nowadays and of course heroism and supernatural fiction. It's like Breakfast Club, Chronicles, Pacific Rim and even a bit of Toy Story 3 all combined. I laughed, teared up, threw my hands in the air, and even though I acknowledge it has its issues I enjoyed the heck out of it. The kids have to work on their acting, tho. The comedy was cheesy here and there but it's Power Rangers so what you expect? Also they touch very relevant issues, like mental illness, peer pressure, bullying, etc. And the importance of friendship and unity. It gets pretty emotional here and there. And it doesn't really piggyback that much on the nostalgia element, but when it does it hits you square in the Yay! bone. Go watch it. It's silly entertainment and cheesy fun at its best. Like the first Transformers. I even like it more than the first Transformers actually.",Power Rangers
252,and-charalambous,It was great!!,7,20 April 2017,"In short, it was amazing and I am really sad it's not doing good at the box office which means it probably won't have a sequel since the studio won't make money off it. Anyway, I have been begging some of my friends to go and watch but I ended up going alone because they are losers but whatever. I am SO glad I went to watch it because it was freaking awesome. It gave me a good dose of nostalgia, awesome visuals, great music/soundtrack, good cast and OK story. It had the potential to be a franchise opener but people just missed this chance.",Power Rangers
253,arogalsky79,"pretty decent, but wanted more 'morphin time'",7,2 July 2017,"When I first saw the trailer I expected it to either be really awesome or really terrible. I was betting on the latter. Ultimately though, it was actually somewhere in between. More updated than maybe the 90's child would have liked, but still plays homage to the original series without destroying it. I am a 90's child and was in love with the original series. That being said, had this movie been exactly like the original I would have hated it. It is beloved and has its own awesomness surrounding it being so 90's, but by today's standards it is outdated and overly cheesy. So if the movie copied the original it would have tanked, guaranteed. For this reason I am glad they took their own spin on it and adapted it to be a little more modern. But the inner 90's child in me giggled with glee when the classic ""its morphin' time!"" line was used and megazod appeared, all the classic moments in the TV show. My biggest complaint and main reasons for giving it a 7 out of 10 is I would have liked to see less teenage drama and more ""morphin time"". They didn't morph until the last 30 min of the movie, and although the end fight was everything I hoped for it to be, I would have liked to see more of power ranger mode sprinkled throughout the movie. Besides that, the cast was decent, Bryan Cranston as Zordon was perfect, and Elizabeth Banks made an even better Rita than in the series (I know I'll get chastised for saying that, but she was the one character on the show I hated. So I thoroughly enjoyed Banks' portrayal) and the power rangers moments when they finally came made me miss the good ole days. I hope if there is a sequel they'll try to add more in and build on the green ranger that they tease in the end. Overall not too bad!",Power Rangers
254,afjmf,Why was this movie made?,4,4 April 2017,"This is not a Power Ranger movies. You can see the title and think ""Go, Go, Power Rangers!"" in your head, but there the similarities end. I will break down what this movie is by percentages: 5% Pacific Rim, 15% Power Rangers, 40% Chronicle, and 40% The Breakfast Club. All the race changes do not make a cool movie. It makes the First five look bad, Alpha-5 look stupid, and Zordon look self-serving. Goldar is totally wrong and Rita was designed after a Power Rangers in Space villain. Zordon does want to stop Rita, who had Been a Ranger (?), 65 million years ago with Zordon (?)and was trapped in a cave or something, while Zordon was trapped in the Morphin Grid. I say Zordon is self-serving because the only reason, initially, is so the Morphin Grid will open and he can reenter the world a living being. The part that gets me is when Billy (now a black nerd with weak hip-hop moves ""dies"", Zordon has the chance to become ""alive"" again, and brings him back to life. This irks me as Zordon as the Blue Ranger would be most interesting, and would Billy have been stuck in the wall? Poor Zack is the most pathetic though. Now an poor Asian with a sick mother, he is so bland as Billy got the dance moves. This movie is Voltron meets Chronicle, and it is mostly boring trash.",Power Rangers
255,micahbundy,Better Than Expected,7,28 January 2018,"Power Rangers is directed by Dean Israelite and follows some troubled teens that find themselves brought together by fate when they find stones that give them superpowers that they use to fight a greater enemy. As this plot progressed, I thought this film was going to be rough. The teens felt cliché and the dialogue between some of the rangers was awful, but after the fist act, the film began to take off.The film moved smoothly and never seem to bog down. The action sequences were nothing special, but were entertaining and were executed pretty well. The film definitely could have just tried to stuff humor in each scene, but the humor and lighthearted moments felt natural and appropriate when these moments happened. The character development is surprisingly good and the film does a great job of growing the bond between the rangers in a very believable way. Although, some of the characters don't feel as fleshed out as others do. One of the rangers had autism and the film didn't go over the top with this. It was approached in a rather subtle and realistic way that I really appreciated as someone who has a brother with autism. The acting in this film was good, but nothing great, which is kind of expected in a film like this. The lore of Power Rangers is used effectively and that's why the moments in the film that paid homage to the franchise felt like they worked. This film had multiple target audiences. With all the target audiences, came multiple tones during the film, which made the film feel all over the place at times. Overall, I thought this film was good. It brings a fresh and welcomed twenty seventeen feel to a film that has decent acting, solid characters, good effects, and manages to portray autism through a main character in a very realistic and effective way. This film definitely has some negatives. It has an extremely rough first act that accounts for most of its moments of pure cringe and suffers tone changes. Everything was just good and nothing really stood out to me as great and that's why I would give this movie a: 7.2/10",Power Rangers
256,akilianetc-23277,Great Updated Twist,8,28 June 2018,"As Zordon said, only find those who are worthy and strong. So I think the cast did a great job at portraying that with this modern updated storyline. I remember watching the original TV series when it first debut as I was just a kid then. I felt like the chemistry between all of them could have been a little more natural but in the end it's about being a team and only 2 hours doesn't do so much justice to that. I really hope to see what they do with the sequel.",Power Rangers
257,pianotm-58404,If Breakfast Club was a Superhero movie,9,26 March 2017,"Many of the bad reviews that came out for this movie make some good points, but a few are obviously pretentious, and are badmouthing the movie based on film snobbery and have little to do with the substance film. The film itself does not match the verdict of these pretentious reviews, all of which fail miserably to address any points of the film. It's as if these people expect even the lowest children's to have the same artistry as a Ridley Scott or an Orson Welles piece, and it begs the question, if these people demand such a high quality from their films, then why are they watching kid targeted superhero movies? Power Rangers starts out weak, with relatively poor cinematography in a chase sequence and an overall uncomfortable introduction to three of our heroes. It takes them awhile to start to have chemistry, but 15 to 20 minutes after the opening logos, they're starting to play well together, and the film starts to be enjoyable. Once they discover the coins and begin to develop their powers, it quickly becomes obvious that this movie was made by fans of the show, and while this is certainly a cash grab, it's anything but soulless. It's genuinely funny for all of the right reasons (and some of the wrong reasons). It has a few moral messages that don't quite hit the mark, but it's obvious what they're trying to say. Elizabeth Banks has the camp turned up to overdrive. This movie isn't Shakespeare and she knows it. She is totally not taking this seriously, and honest to goodness, I love her to death for it. She completely owns Rita Repulsa. She does over-the-top beautifully.The movie adds a bit of unnecessary angst. The Rangers aren't friends to start since they don't know each other, but for the most part, they play well together and most of their interaction is totally Breakfast Club, and they do it so well. Zordon has got the Rangers together for totally selfish reasons, and throughout the movie, he isn't the most likable character.Alpha 5 is perfect in every aspect. He's totally the Alpha 5 you remember but he's nicely refined and his place in the movie makes him irreplaceable.The film takes more time with the Zords. In the show, the Zords would immediately form Megazord upon being summoned. Here, it spends time showing us the individual Zords in action before showing us Megazord.It's true: this movie doesn't superhero quite like it's flashier competitors. It's action set pieces, except for the last one, aren't as big. Surprisingly, it's actually a little less flash and takes more time with the characters on an interpersonal level. Somehow, at the same time, it absolutely succeeds in delivering everything you expect from a Power Rangers movie. From morphing, to battles with enemies made from clay (fans will know the Putty Patrolers only too well), to robot battles, and finally to the giant Kaiju battle at the end. Even the theme is well represented. The movie has a multitude of obvious weaknesses, but it hits all of the right notes and it's exactly what you want from Power Rangers.",Power Rangers
258,hristogbalabanov,Loved it.,8,12 April 2017,"The movie was cheesy, but good. I was honestly not sure what to expect, going into the theater. A part of me expected something akin to a joke of a movie, another part expected something super edgy and dark akin to things like Transformers and Pacific Rim. Instead it was a good, solid comedy with fleshed out action scenes. To be completely honest, there were a lot of cliché moments and I feel something could have been done to limit them, but maybe they were a call back to the original series, who truly knows. All in all, it was awesome, funny movie and I smiled half of the time and when they played the original theme, I lost it. A solid star up just for that.",Power Rangers

260,Akwel,A convoluted way of selling donuts,5,10 March 2018,"Going in I had no nostalgic connections or any sort of prior knowledge of the ""Power Rangers"" aside from a few clips online, I hadn't even seen the trailer but that's mostly because trailers spoil to much generally. Taking that into account I'm confident in saying I went in from an objective standpoint, I didn't have any built up expectations that it would have to live up to, no childhood memories it had to reflect, all in all I was in a good state to enjoy a movie.All that being said it was obvious from the get go that it was gonna be a cookie-cutter hero origin story. The lack of fleshing out characters I guess is reasonable considering there's 5 different backstories to take care of in its 2 hours of runtime which for example Marvel took independent movies to do, therefor I'm not super mad about that. I just wish they could have found a way to steer away from focusing on the most boring character, the red one, there's been tons of reiterations of the jock with a bad knee that's not a newly invented trope and they didn't have a new twist on it either aside from maybe him being less of an asshole than the norm. When it comes to the Villain, she's very meh. Elizabeth Banks does a great job being a whimsical snob in ""the hunger games"" trilogy but as a villain or rather this particular villain she does not shine, she's in fact very, very dull. Her every line could be taken out of a children's TV show, and not a good one like I'm sure ""Power Rangers"" was, the bad kind that is clearly directed towards younger children that likes likes shapes and shiny things. I wish the writing was better so that I could actually judge her acting but the movie just didn't give her an opportunity to do so.One thing that I actually loved about this movie is that the 2nd act so blatantly becomes a very high budget Krispy Kreme commercial, I'm a big fan of Krispy Kreme so I didn't mind but that may take away from the overall ""Power Rangers"":ness of the movie for those who have fond memories to compare with. 5/10 is all I can give this one, for you movie goers it might be more enjoyable but my experience did not amount to more than that.",Power Rangers
261,puertorricanhealingtouch,This movie is awesome,10,2 September 2019,"Listen people, first of all, this movie is the best power ranger movie out there! If you're stuck in the 90's version of it, snap the hell out of if, this movie is not for you only, it actually has elements of the old and the new stuff. It is NOT sexualized like someone said, just like the power rangers, it deal with real life situation and how to over come them, in a more modern way, so get over your old mentality self, and yes! I adore the 90's power rangers, I grew up with them.It is sad that people review a movie and make it sound so bad, because it doesn't suit their ego. That's just bad reviewing, get a grip, and stop living in the past.As for the second part, I'm looking forward to it coming out!Rita looks SUPER AWESOME in this movie! And the Goldar, it is awesome.

262,dahmenjudith,"Loyal to the Original, just better!",8,4 April 2017,"This movie was quite a positive surprise!I had expected a modern version in the style of the 1993 original series, just with the advanced CGI technology of the 21st century. While the original still holds an iconic status among fans, it was pretty ridiculous at the same time (which is probably a reason for it being so iconic ;-) ), and I'm happy to say that the new movie is a lot more serious. Not serious in the way of ""nothing to laugh"", there are plenty of jokes, mostly good ones actually. They simply left out things like the exaggerated ninja poses, Rita's shrieking laughs, and Bulk & Skull. Also, the movie shows us a lot more of the heroes' character backgrounds. Instead of being the most popular gymnasts and martial arts champions in the high school, the five each have their own personal problems to deal with, and some of them are not even popular at all to begin with. I love how their characters have more depths than in the series and how they develop along with the storyline. It's not just an action movie with a lot of fighting, on the contrary. Way more than half the movie deals with the five developing their characters, learning, accepting, and some very nice bonding moments. The actors are perfect for their roles, really. I needed some time to get used to Kimberly with dark hair because I kept mixing her up with Triny at first, but the dark hair really suits her. Concerning Billy, I was a bit sceptical when I saw they had casted a black actor and also seemed to have made Billy the comic relief. I don't like it when Black people are only casted to be made fun of, but luckily, Billy has some amazing character traits which make him an important piece of the story. I must admit I've really enjoyed this movie, and I'm looking forward to the sequel.",Power Rangers

264,Justin_Shanahan,Honestly a good film,10,25 March 2017,"Yes, it is very different from the original but bares some similarities. I didn't like the zords that much, only because they look extremely different. I couldn't tell if the black ranger was driving a mastodon, or some unknown creature zord. The zords were hard to recognize. I like that it is all modern, but at least make the zords recognizable and the suits. Don't get me wrong, the suits were nice, and I did like them a lot, but I wish they were more recognizable. I thought Elizabeth Banks did a great job. She did play a villain role well and I'd like to see more of that. Although, I was disappointed that she was in green clothing. She is bringing Rita to a new level and that is good. At least she had Goldar with her. He was updated, nothing wrong with that but at least have him talk and have a face. The putties were good, again, you couldn't tell what they were. What I am trying to say is that changes are always good, and I am all for it, but if you're going to update a character or zords for that matter, at least make it recognizable. Like the Mighty Morphen Power Ranger Movie back in the 90's were updated but recognizable. It really does suck that her goons weren't in the movie and speaking of goons, I'm sad that they didn't have Bulk and Skull. Just like Rita and Goldar, they will always be apart of the Power Ranger universe. It just wasn't the same without them. Alpha's voice should of stood the same, seeing as he was Alpha 5. Again, there was a lot of changes to the film vs The Original.The sound effects were good. The music was good. I hope to see more of the morphin sequences and Zords transforming into the Megazord. Overall, this film is good and I am gonna watch it again.",Power Rangers
265,Nintendo600,An absolute cheese fest of outdated madness,3,24 March 2017,"Power Rangers was an easy 2 hours of my life and $22.95 ill never get back. Origin stories tend to be good, and also sometimes not so good. This one falls into the latter, with a solid 75% of the film setting up the final 20 minutes of the film and leaving the main villain who is very two-dimensional (not to mention Elizabeth Banks' terrible, terrible fake accent, sorry). With bad narrative, an unfinished and poorly written script/dialogue, there really isn't to go off.Some characters and series' are very outdated, (Superman, Green Lantern, majority of DC and their cartoon costumes that were bad enough in the 40's) unfortunately, Power Rangers is just one that belongs and needs to stay buried in the 90's. Seeing those costumes and hearing ""its morphin' time"" in the mid to late 2010's just sounds awfully outdated. PW has had its time, hopefully Lionsgate will be more smarter not to continue this franchise and ruin the memory many of us millennials had of the suited heroes.",Power Rangers
266,dimskodras,Not awful but not great either.,7,5 January 2020,"I went in the theatre with low expectations. I really thought that it was gonna be just mindless cgi fest with a stupid forgettable plot. I have to admit I was wrong and I am glad I was. Power Rangers actually invests more to the human side of the Rangers than their superhero side but it does not overshadow it. Needless to say that Billy is my favourite character of the flim because he's so unique. I was a little mad at first because they changed Billy from a nerdy guy with glasses to a black guy and they made Zack an asian but in the end , I found myself not as bothered from it as I thought I would be. Elizabeth Banks makes a great Rita Repulsa too with her superb acting skills. I also found Zordon's origin story (the intro of the movie) really interesting and I would like to know more about that era.
The cons of the movie is that they messed up almost all of the helmet designs and some of the zords for no reason , they made Goldar a giant gold mess without a shred of personality and Megazord's face looks like a cloud and that sucks. Yeah , I know that doesn't make sense but if you see it then you'l agree.
The last con is that the movie could include some better acting at times to make the plot even more solid. If you are a fan of Power Rangers , you already have watched this but if you are not , I wouldn't recommend it.",Power Rangers

268,rtwerk-36870,Simply awful,2,26 June 2017,"I will admit right off the bat that this movie is a perfect example of a pet peeve of mine: sloppy writing. Although it is not entirely the writers' fault. There is only an hour's worth of movie and the rest is padding. We don't see actual Power Rangers until an hour and a half into a two hour movie. If their target audience was 15 year olds, then the crappy story isn't so much of a problem. By the time the Power Rangers finally show up... I've stopped caring. And I didn't think it would be possible, but Elizabeth Banks is totally miscast and downright horrible. I had 15 minutes left on the movie and gave up. Didn't even care how it ended.",Power Rangers

Well I am not a big fan of PR due to those old TV show action scenes but this was better than expected. Although some scenes were cringy (no spoilers) and the monsters could've been different (like the gold one) and more presentable, it was still good to see.... now i don't know if the monsters were like that originally (cause, not a fanboy) but the main villain could've fought better for someone who took down tougher rangers.

271,batmanjokercatwoman,"Transformers, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Fant4stic if they were done right!",8,12 April 2017,"Following on the footsteps of Transformers and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, this is the latest film adaptation of a children's TV show and toy franchise. Unlike the former two, I actually like this one. Not the biggest fan of the original series, as a kid I only watched the Mighty Morphin-era up until the 1995 movie, it has been over 20 years so I don't remember everything about it.The plot of this film in a nutshell similar to the pilot for the original –Villainess Rita Repulsa has escaped imprisonment, five teenagers were selected to become the next team of Power Rangers, they meet Zordon and Alpha whom tell them their new gifts, they are sceptical but accept when danger arrives, they morph into their suits, gain their Zords leading to a battle in which the Zord form to become to the Megazord. In the pilot episode, that was 20 minutes long and this film expands it to two hours.They use that time to develop the characters, which I greatly appreciate because the Rangers in the original weren't really complex or realistic, they were more archetypes for how you want teenagers to be not what they actually are. Here they written to have story arcs to make them more relatable, some even have their character traits from the original and are given new twists to them. Jason is a sports star like in the original but has gone off the rails when a prank goes terribly wrong. Kimberley in the original was a valley girl, here she was part of the 'mean girl' cheerleader crowd whom also has gone off the rails when she's excluded for sharing a secret photo. Billy is a socially awkward nerd in the original, here he's a genius who is struggling with autism. Zack is a truant who is an adrenaline- junkie, struggling with a sick mother. Trini keeps herself to herself as she struggles to make friends due to her family moving a lot and possibly struggling with her sexuality. I don't remember much about Zack or Trini in the original, I do know they received quite a bit of criticism of being possible racist stereotypes – black guy in the black-suit and Asian girl in the yellow-suit. Their ethnicities have been changed as Zack is played by Chinese- Canadian actor Ludi Lin and Trini is played by Latina-American actress Becky G, in fact the cast is pretty diverse Dacre Montgomery whom plays Jason is Australian, Naomi Scott as Kimberly is English and RJ Cyler as Billy is African-American. All five of these actors deliver excellent performances and make you relate to characters you'd probably hate.Bryan Cranston plays Zordon, whom original provided some voice-work in the original series and the character Billy Cranston is named after him. I like what they did with the character, instead of just being a God-like mentor to the Rangers he has his own character arc. I like that he was former Power Ranger along with Rita and she betrayed them (I don't think that was the case in the original). Elizabeth Banks is greatly over-the-top as Rita, rightly so as Rita was ridiculously OTT in the original that she was dubbed with a shouting- voice. Thankfully they never go that far with her, there are times where she seems to channel Glenn Close's Cruella De Vill, however they are moments when she can be quite intimidating.What also makes this film work is it's sense of humour, despite grounding the main characters it doesn't forget that it's based on a cheesy kids show. So it doesn't go all too dark, it knows not to take itself too seriously, it has it's silly moments and is even self-aware at times. Of course it has the most blatant product placement for Krispy Kreme ever, even they have fun with it I remember that getting a lot of laughs in the cinema.In a lot of ways this is what Josh Trank's Fant4stic should have been like, Fantastic Four was a cheesy comic with a great family dynamic and the 2015 film took away all of that. This film has a nod to Trank's Chronicle when they first try out their new powers, which made me realise how darkening up a cheesy story can work and not work.This a perfect popcorn movie (or should I say donut movie?) it has great characters, over- the-top action and special effects, as far as I can tell respects it's source material and more importantly it's fun.",Power Rangers
272,mayurrajbagul,Not that bad,8,16 November 2019,This movie has good origin story good acting performances great soundtrack it has a very good build up sequel,Power Rangers
273,zoliking,Not worth the time it takes to watch,1,18 June 2017,"Rating: 1/5 What earned the film the rating: Absolute lack of any originality, banal story-line, a conflict built on unbelievable coincidence and 0 effort in trying to make any sense.Comments The characters: There is 1 character in the film, Billy. He is a shallow character whose interestingness is derived from his mental condition which is never used by the writers in any meaningful way, but at least he can pass for what we would call a character. The rest of the people in the story are vanilla clichés with less depth than graphine. The other four rangers are attempts to pander to age/gender/racial demographics, Zordon is the stereotypical pretends-to-be-a-hard-ass-but-he-really-cares mentor stereotype and Rita's entire personality begins and ends with her quest for world domination through the destruction of Earth.The performances: As you can infer from the types of characters in the film, there weren't much room given to the actors to shine the mastery of their craft, but there are two notes worth mentioning: RJ Cyler's performance of Billy pretty much single handedly made it possible to bear through this thing while surprisingly enough Elizabeth Banks's attempts at being menacing came off as comical.The plot: It starts with a pile of coincidences where Rita happens to be discovered just as exactly 5 people randomly pop upon the 5 magic ranger crystals. Then it has a flat and almost conflict free build to the final battle which is a straight up face off with no tactical nuance that ends with an giant robot pulled straight from the writer's ass. Granted, bitch slapping the villain into space could have been a bad-ass end, but the amount of randomness, silliness and emotional emptiness that surrounds that moment takes away its edge.The lack of any sense: Just a few of the major plot points that are left completely unexplained: Where do the rangers and their magic stones come from? Are there more like them in distant quadrants of space? If so, when Zordon's group disappeared, why didn't anybody come looking for the magic crystals? If not, then are the 6 of them responsible to guard every life crystal in every inhabited planet in the galaxy? If Rita can come back to life then how does being sunk in the ocean prevent her from doing so? Why did she sink in the first place? If she sank how could she have been caught up in a fishing net submerged to a depth where schools of fish swim? If Rita is the green ranger turned evil, then why are her powers completely and radically different from the others'? Why would the rangers morphing allow Zordon to come back to life? Why does it allow Billy to come back to life? Why is there a limit of 1 on coming back to life if the rangers can morph more than once? What are all the mundane authorities of the USA doing while a weird looking alien is killing people and blowing stuff up in small town America? When Rita captures the rangers what makes her spare the life of 4? How does the robots combining increase their power rather than simply limiting their mobility? If pulling the crystal unleashes a devastation of multitudinous nuclear explosions, and Rita is happy to stand in the epicenter of all that does it mean she could withstand that force?",Power Rangers
274,Randomgirl111,Enjoyable,7,9 July 2021,"I'm gonna get the best thing about this film out of the way first and why the rating isn't any lower (since this character was quite prominent): the autism representation! As an aspie myself, I applaud the writers for actually creating such a likeable character that I could connect myself to. Unlike other representations, Billy (the aspie) isn't one-dimensional. The writers actually realised that autism is a mental condition, NOT a personality trait. Yes, Billy is autistic. But that doesn't mean he lacks empathy, courage, maturity, patience or teamwork skills. Autism also doesn't stop him from being a power ranger. What makes Billy a really believable representation of autism to me is, unlike Music where Sia used autism as an excuse to not develop Music's character and personality, Billy's autism gave him not just some of the challenges of autism (difficulty in understanding sarcasm and jokes, repetitive behaviour, lack of social skills) but also some of the positives of autism (high intellect, great imagination, he's brilliant at the hobbies he's into, like making gadgets and adjusting them etc) but he also has other traits which show that, even if autism is part of who he is, it doesn't make up 100% of who he is. Traits include: great mediator, great team player, great team leader (why wasn't he the red ranger), great friend, passionate about superheroes, completely selfless, curious, super epic fighter, caring and so on. Billy is literally not just my new favourite aspie in any type of media. But he's also one of the most likeable and well written characters I've seen in the last 10 years. I can literally see him a role model for aspies to either look up to or relate to. I would say that every other character in the movie was kinda dull. I honestly think 98% of the time, Billy was carrying the all of the heart or the movie. This brings us to one problem I had while watching this film: the rest of the main cast. Why? Because the rest of the main cast are either unlikable, stupid, bland or all of the above. And no. Then quickly explaining their sob stories does not give them any depth. Yes, Billy's dad died but he had a likeable personality and layers to his character. No other character has that. The rest of the cast is so unremarkable that I've already forgotten their names. The red power ranger is an idiot who does reckless, stupid stuff without a reason (e.g. Steals a cow, crashes a car), is angsty with his dad (who is rightfully upset with him) for no reason at all and is overly aggressive for, again, no reason, the yellow and pink rangers are just bland and under-developed and the black power ranger is so annoying, stupid and stubborn (in a bad way) that I wanted to knock some sense into him by punching his smug face. Like, why did he hop into the obviously dangerous-looking, enormous, robotic dino when he knew he was still training to be a ranger? I was also kinda disappointed that the power rangers didn't get their armour and stuff until the finale of the film. Luckily, there are still good things about the film, besides Billy, that made it engaging enough for me to keep watching. I'll admit the suits themselves (apart from the out of place mouth pieces), the effects, the action, the zoids were cool though. I also think the story structure itself was executed quite well and engaging to watch, the humour was funny, the cheesy tone was true to the original tv shows, the villian is entertaining and threatening, and the acting was fantastic. Anyway, yes, this film has flaws and it's lack of fan service might be a little disappointing to a lot of power rangers fans. But I definitely cannot call this a bad one. If you're looking for a decent action film with a good amount of cheesiness, you'll probably like this film. And I would especially recommend it to aspies, if they need a cool one to relate to and look up to. I seriously think this film would be 10 stars to me if Billy was the main character. But as it is, it's fine.",Power Rangers

276,alecfrazier,"Autism Can Make You a Better Superhero: A Film Review of Power Rangers (2017), by Alec Frazier and Autistic Reality",10,9 April 2017,"This review would like to focus on Billy Cranston, played by RJ Cyler.The very first thing we see Billy doing is arranging colored pencils quite meticulously. I immediately thought, ""Ooh, I used to do that!"" And in fact, it is very true. I used to be absolutely obsessed with coloring in floor plans with Crayola colored pencils.Billy is excellent with gadgets, and when he mentioned that he is on the autism spectrum, I in the audience said, ""DUH!! Of course you are!"" We are treated to a view of Billy's sanctuary in the basement of his house. It looks like a dream come true for an intellectual individual. There are tons of gadgets, often cobbled together by Billy's own invention from items that he has salvaged from various locations. The thing is that in real life, as opposed to the stereotype, autistic individuals do not tend to be absolute wunderkind savants. This results in a number of hilarious moments throughout the film when Billy accidentally makes things blow up, slip, trip, sproing, fladap, shtoink, and just about every other word invented by Don Martin. (Look him up. One of the greatest cartoonists of all time!)All of the five are somewhat hesitant to explore being a Ranger, except for Billy. He is extremely excited about the entire thing. During the whole film, he talks a lot, and he sometimes divulges inappropriate information. That is par for the course with autistic individuals, including myself. Luckily, Jason will sometimes politely remind him that his cup runneth over. I would like to reiterate at this point that friends are amazing, and that autistic individuals should never be afraid of socializing. Billy is also sometimes hesitant to engage in physical stunts, and in real life many autistic people are more involved in the intellectual than in physical activity.When most of the team is unable to generate their armor, suddenly, one of them does. Billy becomes the first one able to do so. They later discovered that, because the unit is a team, their ability to generate armor depends on their ability to know each other. This is actually tremendous news for Billy, and the autistic community. It is frequently said that we autistics do not get the rest of humanity. However, Billy clearly gets the others better than they get each other. Many autistic individuals are incredibly observant of everything and anything, including other people.At one point, Rita instigates a fight, and the team gets thoroughly thrashed. In fact, Billy ends up getting killed. They take him to Zordon, who was planning on using the Rangers' power to regenerate his life. Before he plans to do so, the rest of the Rangers speak of how they would all give their life for Billy. For autistic people to find real, tangible friendship, the kind which involves self-sacrifice, is a gigantic triumph. As mentioned before, autistic people are not always the best at interpersonal relations. However, with proper time and effort, we can form wonderful friendships. In the end of this scene, Zordon decides to regenerate Billy's life instead of his own, and they go off to fight Rita.Billy is the first definitively autistic superhero in an A-list Hollywood film. Based on criticism of The Accountant, various members of the autistic activist community may point out that it is not realistic to portray an autistic person as a superhero because we autistics are not special, but rather a naturally occurring subset of society. To this I say, ""WTF!?"" This film has dinosaurs, ancient aliens, giant robots, a humongous golden monster, and a woman who comes back to life after 65 million years at the bottom of the sea! I think we can learn to suspend our disbelief a little bit.In addition, it is noteworthy that the Blue Ranger is autistic, as the color blue is symbolic of autism awareness. Although many autism activists do not like the color blue standing for autism, they should recall that the color predates any of the harmful efforts by Autism Speaks. The autism activists would point out that the color blue was chosen because it was initially thought that was prevalent mostly in males. Once again, may I point out that perceptions and symbols can change and adapt. What was once thought of as mostly male is now known to be spread more or less evenly between genders, although autism sometimes manifests slightly differently in each gender. Although the blue color was initially meant to reflect the male gender, the intent was not sexist, and the color can be perceived as applying to both genders.A word about Trini. There is a wonderful scene where they are all getting to know each other better, and someone mentions boyfriend troubles, and she hesitates a bit. Person that mentions girlfriend troubles, and she also hesitates about that. You see, Trini identifies as a female in terms of pronouns, but she makes it clear that she does not let conventional definitions apply to her. Trini is queer, and may be the first big-budget superhero in the Hollywood film to definitively have that identity.As an autistic person with autistic friends and acquaintances all across the autism spectrum, I do not think I have seen a more accurate depiction of autism in popular culture, except for possibly the character I review in my first book, Without Fear: The FirstAutistic Superhero. Both myself and my firm, Autistic Reality, would like to fully endorse this film. We will attempt to get in touch with Lionsgate Entertainment and Saban, to make that endorsement official. Both myself and my firm give this amazing wonderful film ten out of ten stars, or five out of five. It is very rare to see a good, high profile film that so flawlessly embodies diversity.

277,crakatoot,I'm not sure what the critics were expecting but this was pretty good,8,23 March 2017,"I remember watching the premiere back when I was six years old, and... I thought it was idiotic. The original show was always to goofy for me, even as a little boy. But I had nothing to do and I had some movie passes so I decided to check it out. It's actually pretty good. A lot of critics are going into this expecting to hate it and their reviews reflect that. In the reviews I've read or seen, I keep hearing things like ""Well its not as stupid as it could have been"" or ""Some of it wasn't so terrible"" or other equally back handed compliments. The reality is, the Power Rangers is an inherently silly idea. But once you get past that, this is a pretty fun movie. You know the drill, five kids get together in Angel Grove, a much grittier Angel Grove than I remember. They get their hands on some power coins, Rita Repulsa shows up and some over the top action ensues. So yes, it is just a bigger version of what we saw on the show, but still effective. It takes itself more seriously than the show did and it is much darker. But it doesn't go to far, it still feels close to the original and it does have its lighter moments. Its biggest strength though was the chemistry between the leads. The five kids really worked well with each other. And they did spend time developing each of them. They definitely worked well as a team. And Elizabeth Banks killed it as Rita. I've heard some reviewers complain that she was to over the top, but no way. Rita is supposed to be over the top. You can tell Banks was having a lot of fun. She had a particularly brutal scene with the Trini the Yellow Ranger. And needles to say, the climax was awesome. The new Zords, the new costumes, they looked great. If I had one complaint, and it is a bit odd, the two girls are a little to similar. The three boys are all distinct. But the two girls, they even look way to much alike. Once the costume are on, then it's easy to tell. And if your a big fan of the series, pay attention, there are a few references here and there.",Power Rangers

279,jswacker,"Doesn't deserve ""all"" the hate.",7,3 August 2017,"So for starters, I'll say that this movie isn't a 7, it's more like a 6.1, where it had a lot problems, but was just fun enough, and had just enough nostalgia factor to make me remember the good ol 90s. The reason I gave it a 7 is because it doesn't deserve all the hate it's getting from a generation of cry babies, and giving it a slightly higher rating won't really hurt.The problems of the movie: The editing seemed a little choppy, and it often felt that they skipped over some things when cutting to a different scene, making me wonder how much of the movie was left out to shorten the run time. The C.G.I. at the end of the movie was lacking, as if they had to cut the budget towards the end. And the acting could have been a lot better = Elizabeth Banks's performance was just plain weird, while Naomi Scott (the pink ranger) and Dacre Montgomery (the red ranger, or as I like to call him, Zach Ephron's younger brother who can't act) were horrible.The pros of the movie: There is a lot of potential in this world that they have built, and it is definitely one of those movies that the sequel could be better, especially now that the orgin story is out of the way. The movie was a lot of fun, even despite its flaws. And despite the bad acting from a few of the cast, other actors like RJ Cyler (the blue ranger), Ludi Lin (the black ranger), and Becky G. (the yellow ranger) shined when they actually got the screen time they deserved.To wrap it up: This is definitely a movie worth watching. You can have a lot of fun if you don't try and hold it to some ridiculously high standards like a lot of the cry babies growing up in the 90s did. Just sit back, turn your brain off, and enjoy the movie for what it is = Silly Cheesy Fun.",Power Rangers
280,koffeekupkriminalk,View Through Hollywood Colored Glasses,2,8 July 2017,"It sure would be nice to see a movie about teenagers where the teenagers aren't self-centered, narcissistic half-wits. But that seems to be the consensus as seen on both the small and big screens. And teens seem to think that is an accurate portrayal. The most ironic scene in the movie is when it is explained that these particular teens were chosen to be Power Rangers because they possess the purest hearts. Just minutes before, they were engaged in a high speed chase from police, in a stolen vehicle because they set off a bomb in a restricted area. Then, after failing in their PR training, these teenagers of the purest of heart, decided to camp out that night and sulked around a campfire drinking beer. Apparently, their parents are of the purest of hearts as well since this seemed OK with them. Aside from that, the movie unsuccessfully attempts to sell a complicated original story but these pure hearts just couldn't close the deal. Muddled, messy, often incoherent, the movie was too long, but that might only be because it moved too slow. There was surprisingly little action for a Power Rangers movie.",Power Rangers

I find the plot unconventional and certain scenes were simply off. The first half of the film was entertaining despite the plot, filled with action and funny moments. I expected to see more fights with the Power Rangers' suits, but unfortunately the fighting scenes were considerably short. The Rangers' enemies were poor looking except the main villain which was supposed to do something that didn't. Why wouldn't they give the people what they really want ? It reminds me of those films where the best parts are saved for the last minutes. At least films like Transformers and Pacific Rim pleased the audience with more than 1 Sci Fi action scene and things felt more balanced. It's like the director focused on the real life of the young super heroes and didn't know how to handle the action scenes. Overall the film is fun, but they didn't give us much of the rangers it felt more like Transformers in the end, but with cheaper looking giants fighting each other. I hope there is a sequel and the director handles the things better.",Power Rangers

It is understandable that after being renewed for FIVE sequels - that some background set-up is required, and trying to establish character background would be important (although this film falls far short of making the characters have any emotional pull).When the movie finally gets rolling - that is when fans of the franchise can sit back, and really enjoy the show. For those who are seeing this movie as long-time fans of the Rangers - get ready for the nostalgia trip of your life. As a fan of the series, I left this movie satisfied and smiling after the final forty five minutes of pure enjoyment.

Also one track in particular sounds like an Trance remix of the Hans Zimmer soundtrack . 6)You kinda wanna see the rangers and their zords in the movie...but prepare to be disappointed Is it completely trash ? No, CGI and Product Placement will make it watchable for your kids . Looking for nostalgia ? Too bad ..Keep on searching you ain't gonna find it here .

I was a fan of the original power rangers when it aired, and only that show. Never watched any of the series beyond that. First of all, tons of back story and it takes forever for the good action to actually happen, thats fine and well, but I wasn't super interested in this particular backstory and when we finally got action it was underwhelming. Don't really care for the new treatment of the Green Ranger and Rita Repulsa being merged. The zords looked dumb and need to look more reminiscent of the original ones that actually looked like dinosaurs. The suits are dumb and look too alien. Alpha 5 drove me nuts, super annoying and, again, too alien and not enough robot. I felt like it couldn't decide what it wanted to be, some groaner jokes and then tried to be serious, but at the same time its supposed to be kinda corny... it always was and it's not realistic in any way. Look at the original Rita Repulsa, SUPER over the top. I feel like the teenage melodrama is just always difficult to watch. Super cringe, thats where I feel going less serious would have helped this move. Maybe more of a Scott Pilgrim vibe, balanced funny and awesome with a fun use of cgi.I could go on, but no need. I was initially really excited for this, the trailers started the scare me off, but I eventually saw it... unfortunately.Dumb, stupid, yuck, NO NO POWER RANGERS!Reboot... take 2 please!",Power Rangers
288,griscowsky,Enjoyable and Fun,7,13 January 2021,"After seeing the 5.9/10 rating on here, I was worried that this movie would be a waste of my time. So I hesitantly started watching it, with low expectations.And now I remember why I loved Power Rangers so much as a kid! It was soooo good! I'm late to the game (watched in last week in 2020, when it came out in 2017) but I'm glad I made it! The acting was phenomenal and the casting was well done.It was cool to see Naomi Scott (who plays Jasmine in Aladdian) and Dacre Montgomery (who plays Billy in Stranger Things) excel in these roles.I do have a few critiques. I wish there were more ""training"" scenes. I love seeing characters explore their new powers and come together as a team.
I also wish they would have explained their new found ""superpowers"". It seemed like some of them had super strength or speed or agility, but that wasn't focused on much.
And I wasn't a fan of the villain or the actress that played her. I just couldn't connect unfortunately.I would watch a second movie if they make one.",Power Rangers
289,peterfbrand,Brilliant take on the Power Rangers,9,31 July 2020,"I do not know why this movie has been rated so low!!! It's The Power Rangers! It's going to be a little cheesy. I loved how it includes all the various ethnicities and the character who's ""on the spectrum"" my son loved that and it fits really well.
A great feel good movie, great acting, great specials effects, great story line, i loved the extra cheese towards the end with the ""Go-Go Power Rangers bit""
I really believe most of the bad ratings for this movie were from people who have no idea what The Power Rangers was.
Brilliant movie. I HOPE they make a sequel. The lead reminds me of a young Zack Efron.
Thumbs up from me.",Power Rangers
290,daniv1,"Don't judge it based on the earlier ""movies""",8,29 March 2017,"I went to watch this movie to see how much of a joke it would be and I have to admit I was feeling like a jerk afterwards because this was a genuinely great attempt at this kind of movie and you can really feel how much heart and effort went into making it. Though in my defense if you saw the previous attempts at a Power Rangers film you'd have been a skeptic too with their awful sped up fight scenes, ridiculous lines and rubber/foam suits. So its utterly incredible that they were able to step up to the level of something like Pacific Rim or Transformers 1 with a hint of Chronicle for the origins story. Knowing that films with WAY better source material have failed dismally (Dragonball Evolution, X-Men Last Stand) you have to really applaud what the Power Rangers creators did and also withing a PG rating.Its fun, has great slick visuals and never feels strained or boring. They also touch on a few teenage subjects like Cyber-Bullying, conflict with parents, peer pressure, pranks that go too far, and accepting people that are different (such as gays or people with psychological conditions like OCD). It was admirable to see them put these messages in, without being too overbearing/preachy. It also has a great soundtrack which really kicks the action sequences up a notch (including a very brief but awesome rendition of the original theme). Elizabeth Banks and Bryan Cranston also played their roles very well, one cannot accuse them of a cash grab or phoned in performances here.Its great fun, the kind of movie that parents and children can enjoy together, and adults who grew up with the show can watch without feeling embarrassed that this came from their childhood era. Against all odds this movie turned out good..very good.",Power Rangers
291,larry-degala,why it isn't a Transformers blockbuster,3,10 May 2017,"If Saban is going to spend $100 million on ""Power Rangers"", why did Dean Israelite only make $135 million back in the box office? ""Transformers"" made $708 million in 2007. The producers had a strong film budget, so what could possibly go wrong? Watch the midpoint on ""Transformers"" and the midpoint on ""Power Rangers."" I won't spoil it for you. You might get a good hint. Josh Trank of ""Chronicle"" could have done a better job. He made $168 million over his $126 million tent pole ""Fantastic Four"" in 2015. At least he made $42 million over the measly $35 million. Granted that Josh Trank and Dean Israelite are not Michael Bay, Joseph Kahn (another Generation X-er) made a superior version that was mature and well-developed, with chemistry and heart, and a intertwined story line that pulled the audience in, wanting for more. It had action like ""The Matrix"" with gritty drama like SyFy's ""Battlestar Galactica"". I felt his version moved the franchise forward from the small screen to the big. However, the trend is to hire Millennial filmmakers over Generation X filmmakers for budgets over $100 million because (and I quote) ""Millennials can only relate to Millennials."" Really? I mean REALLY? Forgot about Good Story-telling? Hello??!! It is not about one generation relating to another generation. Alfred Hitchcock even kicks butt in the post Millennial era. And so another franchise died as quickly as ""The Last Airbender."" Saban, try again please. Take my Alexander Hamiltons from these dying hands!",Power Rangers
292,franciscofernandes36,The power is on!!!,10,25 March 2017,"First, movies do not all have to be ""dark"" or ""gore."" There is already too much darkness in the world and plenty of blood needlessly spilled. So I liked the comic tone and the energetic rhythm of the movie.In addition, a group of Power Rangers never had their personalities so exploited. The new Jason is a disgruntled hero quarterback who loves to get into trouble, the new Billy is a little genius who misses his father, the new Kimberly is a spoiled girl and plagued by a childish error, the new Zack is an impulsive shelves who is afraid of losing her mother and the new Trini is an outsider with some relationship problems. And what perfectly connect them? The loneliness that the five without exception feels in their hearts. This is the bond that unites them and forms them as a great group.We also have an introit with the story of Zordon's downfall - quite funny the way he and Jason both made mistakes as leaders - and the aiii! aai! aaai! ff Alpha 5 as comic relief.The weaker part of the film is evidently the third act and everything that concerns the villain. The suits / armor are cool and the zords too, but the villain Rita Repulsa, perhaps more for lack of script and ideas than for the demerit of the actress, does not really scare or pull our empathy. It's just one more that wants a crystal to dominate the world and the universe. Still, nothing that can not be remedied in a future sequel...However, for me, the essential thing for this film was to create a true Power Rangers team with a lot to explore in future films.And that was achieved, well done.The kids are very strong ... the power protects them.",Power Rangers
293,MarioSync,Great Movie!!!,10,3 April 2017,"I watched Power Ranger when I was young, and it feels like it was yesterday I saw those dino zord become the Megazord. When I bought the ticket for this movie at first I was quite skeptical since I am wandering how is the writer going to evolve the story about a bunch of teenager getting together and become something else, something bigger than themselves, but I am really happy and glad that my skepticism is not founded. I really like that the movie brings humanity part as well, friendship, trust, the fear of finding something out of this world, and the pace of the story also enough in this time frame. The actors and actress are also good, good casting guys!!! haven't seen Naomi Scott since Terra Nova, and everyone manage to gel the character together well, great job in playing each of your character as well.

I went into the theater not expecting much from this movie but I was wrong, it was a good movie. Not great or OK it was simply good. It had great CGI and the acting was good for a young cast. I loved the first 2 acts of the movie they were really strong and had good story telling. But act 3 in my opinion seemed silly and sort of rushed. The first 2 acts were great because of 2 things. Great characters and a steady pace. The character development was great and I liked how the writers really stuck to making them interesting so that the audience would care about them, especially RJ Cylers character. Nothing was rushed and was going at a great pace and then all of a sudden act 3 came into play and it turned into a mediocre action film and wasn't very exciting and I believe that is due to the villain. I was not a fan. Her motives are too over used and simply a lame character. The actress was fine but the character it'self wasn't anything special and made the action scenes dull. Other than that the kids will love it and if you are a power ranger fan I think you will be pleased. It's fun for the whole family.",Power Rangers

The characters don't feel important to me. The baddies are terrible. The now-typical learn all superpowers on the fly is omnipresent. Etc.The reason I give this an 8, however, is because I enjoyed the comedy, the effort in trying to add some spizazz while maintaining what the original series was about (and that series was terrible but as a child it was oh so good), and the fact that it did actually hit my nostalgia button near the end. I got to relive, albeit terribly, my childhood TV show.",Power Rangers
299,andrebonavita,Better than TV series and 1995 movie. But still a median movie that loose the chance to recreate the worldwide known characters,6,21 November 2017,"I saw this movie without expectation, only waiting a film better than the one made in 1995. The first half-part of the movie is really good, mainly with the rereading of the classical Saban's characters. The 360° rotation camera used in one scene was great. This first part remember me the 2012's movie ""Chronicle"" where young discover their powers. The soundtrack works nicely to introduce the characters and along the movie. Contrasting with the 1/3 part, from 2/3 to the end the director Bryan Spicer gave to us only a median movie with clichés used in TV series an 1995 movie but with extra visual effects. So the great begging was lost and a this median released movie.I like Bryan Cranston as Zordon but as I said before, the director loose his hand at 2/3 part to the end so Cranston could be substituted by anyone with no difference.I think the producers loose a chance to create a bigger cinema franchise and the Pacific Rim.Pros: some fan service and nice soundtrack Cons: median screenplay and chance to produce a better movie.",Power Rangers

The movie is not a proper representation of Power Rangers, it just has so many flaws. I like the special effects, but their armour sucks, their civialian powers suck, it's bot something that was present for the first 8-9 seasons of the show.

306,bigzach2008,Mighty Morphing fun for a new generation!,8,16 June 2017,"This movie really surprised me with how fun, entertaining, and engaging it actually was. It takes the simple premise of having a group of teenagers being selected as guardian warriors who are sworn to protect the Earth from an evil space witch, and elevates it to unexpected new heights. While I most certainly enjoyed the Power Ranger action sequences near the climax of the movie, the parts I enjoyed the most were actually the first and second act. I really liked how this movie took its time to set up and develop the main characters as well as how much it actually dared to get surprisingly emotional at certain points. Each character felt like a unique and believable person, especially the Power Rangers themselves. I enjoyed how they played off of one another and how the relationships between them were given the time and effort needed to make us care about who they are and what happens to them throughout the movie. While I will be the first to admit that the very idea of Power Rangers has always been a silly, corny, and cheesy premise to begin with, I really like how the makers of this movie took the source material seriously and made it into something that has just the right amount of action, comedy, drama, and story to make for an enjoyable film. I really hope they make more sequels and keep pushing for new heights and possibilities. As for all the folks who are hating on this movie, please stop being so ridiculous and closed minded and enjoy it for what it is. It's not perfect, but I highly recommend it for those who are looking for good entertainment as well as those who are longtime fans of this franchise. On a final note, GO GO POWER RANGERS!",Power Rangers
307,seag1508,Poorly paced re-imagining of the classic. Little kids won't like it and not cool or funny enough for anyone else,1,5 December 2017,"It takes OVER 40 MINUTES before Zordon and alpha show up. Worst pacing of any ""action"" movie ever. It plays more like an episode of Friday night lights. The mood has no relation to the original series. Even once Zordon shows up it has too much exhibition and weird flash backs to catch us up with the stories, which might have been fine if it had happened a half our earlier. An HOUR in before the villain even shows up.. whoever cut this movie should be flayed. also the attempts at humor completely fail. Why?!",Power Rangers

It was definitely fun to go back down memory lane. The biggest problem I had with it was the dialogue and character progression. It seems like I'm the only person who wasn't impressed with RJ Cyler ... most of his lines basically consisted of ""Hey guys"" or ""Ummm guys"". While I thought it was good to show ASD, I didn't really buy his performance of it, it only seemed to be shown as a plot device. The relationship between the teenagers was also progressed waaaay to fast. It went from I just met you to- sharing deepest darkest secrets(except Kimberly, who only shared with Jason)in what felt like a matter of minutes. Finally, just a bunch of bad dick jokes ... like a putty getting hit in the genitals, except it doesn't have any. Or the ""milking the cow"" part. Just no.

312,Extragorey,"No, not the Krispy Kreme!",9,11 July 2017,"Full disclosure: I've never watched the Power Rangers of the 90s, but from I've seen they wore cheesy like a glove and it's how most people remember the series.This movie is good. There are plenty of movies where the underdog(s) gets superpowers and saves the day, and this could fall into that category too. But it's a shining example of why that trope works so well.We don't get to know the whole cast of Rangers that well, not really, but we're shown enough to know that they're all broken people. Unhinged, or crushed under the expectations of others, and generally misunderstood by those who should understand them best. But they're thrown together and forced to work with their brokenness, accept it, make it part of them, and grow as a team. It's a reminder to all of us that no one has it all together, but that shouldn't hold us back.The new suits look great (speaking as someone who found the original ones cheesy as hell), the campy dance routine where they all jump into position with weird hand gestures is gone, though a shadow of that camp emerges now and then, accompanied by the classic music. The electronica in the score reminds me of TRON: Legacy's soundtrack, which I loved, so it gets points for that. The CGI works, though unconvincing at times. The movie actually feels a bit rushed, which is an achievement for any movie over 2 hours. It could have fleshed out some of the Rangers more, and the villain, but then the movie might have dragged for some viewers so it's probably best they decided to keep it to 2 hours.At the end of the day, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. It inspires me to push past my own issues and refocus on my goals, which is a great legacy for a movie to have. And it tells people it's alright to be different. Hurrah for weird people!

It had many scenes to bring nostalgia while still doing what a reboot should do, reboot it in a completely different way. The interesting and heavy/dark take on it made it perfect for teenagers today. It's definitely not for kids, and adults who loved the original series will not like this movie because it is nothing like the original, and is oversexualized and too heavy for the fun loving original story. However it's not for that demographic either. The demographic this story is speaking to and meant for is middle schoolers and high schoolers who watched the show when they were kids, such as myself. The topics and struggles every characters goes through are true to the struggles of everyday teens in this day and age. So saying this movie ruins the original or isn't kid friendly, it's kind of a no brainer, because it's telling a new more relevant story for teens who struggle with these issues all the time. This is why I loved it and felt this movie spoke to me. I feel this movie is a must watch for those who are in their teenage years.

315,moninsak-70078,A Welcomed Kind of Different,8,31 May 2017,"I'll preface this review by stating my extreme bias. As most of you know, I am somewhat a Power Rangers fan. So, let's go: I've been waiting for this movie for most of my adult life so even if I was insanely excited that this film was being made, I had my doubts.The film has a lot of the elements of the original series – cringe-worthy one-liners, mid- fight banter, stating the obvious – but there is a new depth to the characters. While definitely not anything exceptionally new, seeing these characters being regular kids is a nice touch. There are some really great moments in this film, most of which takes the audience by surprise, but wholeheartedly welcomed. Performances are solid all-round with this new cast, and Elizabeth Banks takes Rita Repulsa to an entirely different level. Her take on Rita is chilling as it is threatening. The film has a darkness to it and not in a Christopher Nolan kind of way. Instead, it plays on emotions and the consequences of decisions. When we were kids, every decision seemed like it could mean the end of the world. Now? Possibly still.Visually the film plays it safe, though there are some really well-crafted sequences that really make you realise, ""Shit, this isn't just made for kids."" They actually don't spend that much time in the suits and their reveal is a little lame. The music is also a little distracting, but the solid pacing of the film makes it all forgivable. Also Angel Grove is pretty much turned to rubble (of course).You should see this film. I loved it.",Power Rangers

They are only upset because it makes their PRs look bad. And all of the other bad reviews are from religious nuts who don't like the very subtle reference that might mean the Yellow Power Ranger may be questioning her sexuality. Not once did they say it but the reviews would have you believe animals are having sex, kids are doing drugs and gay porn is taking place throughout the film, which it isn't. I'd wager that most of the negative reviews never saw the movie. This movie was good with special effects, background story, acting and more. It wasn't Oscar worthy, don't get me wrong but it was fun, action, sci-fi movie. If you like the original Power Rangers and think they are the best then don't watch this.

The basic storyline is true to the franchise, the action sequences and special effects were well done minus the cheesiness of what made the Power Rangers so painful to watch.",Power Rangers

324,dislexicreading,Great film totally undeserving of the negative press,8,3 July 2017,"Alright, lets start by saying that if your looking for a faithful adaption, look elsewhere. This is not the same 90s cheese from our childhoods, but that doesn't mean its not great. If you go in expecting it to be the same as the original, you WILL be disappointed and, frankly, doing the film a disservice.This film is not simply a modernised rehash of the original, instead it takes the concept and makes it into a decent flick about characters I actually believe are real. True, the formula is somewhat typical of these teen superhero flicks, but at least there was no falling out bit to waist our time. The characters are interesting, although the only things they have in common with the originals are their name and a few minor bits about their personality. Still, despite the changes, I liked them.One of the best differences though is the new design for Rita and, frankly, I loved it. She was genuinely scary and intimidating and I really hope more of these get made so we can see what the creators do with some of the other nasties from later on.",Power Rangers
325,ilike_panama,I didn't feel nostalgic... but it had its highlights,6,26 March 2017,"After watching this movie last week I felt I needed to review it as soon as possible. I was expecting to feel nostalgic with a family oriented movie but it didn't happen. There were many factors like the PG-13 content, something you wouldn't expect in your childhood show. I should have checked the classification before going to the cinema. But anyways... let's start.The music was not that great, maybe just in that part the zords are heading to Angel Grove to save the date. That part was epic. The Fx were pretty decent to me. Some of the action when they discovered their powers reminded me of some teen vampire movie I watched in the 90's. Just that in this case their powers came from the coins provided by the aliens. They did so many risky thinks that you could swear that had to be on meths or something.Zordon was an interesting character, more modern than the old days Zordon. Alpha was not so impressive to me. The villain Rita was really scary so I would not recommend this movie to little kids.I did like the way she delivered her lines.About the Power Rangers, in this version they are so different to the originals... I remind the Red Ranger being a well behaved boy in the 90's show. In this version he is Jason the juvenile offender. Maybe he had some kind of redention when he saved his father's life but I think I would have loved to see some kind of reconciliation.Billy, the black guy, portraying the Blue Ranger's uniform definitely stole the show. He was a very likable character, and his lines were the best.My English is not very good so I had some problems to understand the lines that were given to the Yellow Ranger. Was it a problem of script redaction? I don't know but I could swear I heard she said to her little brothers why not they would like to be the Yellow Ranger and she asks how do they know that Ranger is a make. I was like do she wants them to be the Ranger with boobs? Or does she consider herself a 'he'. Really confusing to me so I thought she was some kid d of Trinny the Trannie.Did you see that episode titled Kalamity Kim? Kim's character was always so cheerful in the TV series that I didn't find a connection between the old and new personality. Save for that episode where she was like having a really bad hair day. But at least the new Kim looked pretty excited and happy when driving her Zord.And last,but not less important let's talk about Zensational Zack, the Black Ranger. He was as cute as a Korean drama actor taking care of his ill mother that it made me feel a lot of tenderness and a tear could have fall from my eye if it had had turned more dramatic.The movie has his ups and downs overall but I wouldn't recommended it to you if you were dreaming about a version true to the original and kids-aimed show.",Power Rangers
326,banditgeneral4,Not as bad as I thought but could've been better,8,9 July 2018,"I've read several reviews and see people complain about how this film is nothing like the original Power Rangers. That's a good tjing.Every version of the Power Rangers is different than the last. That's what makes it unuque. I'm a child of the mud 80s and early 90s. I was 9 when the original show aired. I couldn't wait to get home from school and see the adventures of the Rangers. I would rent episodes on video every week with my allowance. The action could've been better and the plot a little more thought out but overall it's a film worth seeing. It's far different from any of the other shows or movies and that's what's great about it. It also broke all the rules. The smart kid is now African American and not the ""black"" ranger and the black ranger is now Asian American.If folks don't like the movie they are certainly entitled to their opinions but as for this reviewer I would definitely watch it again and it's going in my video collection.",Power Rangers

With them having problems with morfing, we hardly got to see any real Power Ranger action.Why the producers figured we rather watch faces than masks I don't know, it came across as them wanting to promote the actors rather than give us a spectacular fight.I turned the movie off because of this, it really ruined it for me!",Power Rangers

There was basically absolutely no point during the movie where I felt enjoyment.
First of all those dialogs; who is writing this? The dialogs felt so unnatural and out of place. Throughout the movie I felt the dialogs were flat and absolutely irrelevant.The characters; oh my..., I don't remember a single name of any of them, they desperately tried to add depth to each one but failed miserably, partly because of the cast maybe but mainly because of the rubbish called Skript.
We have this typical American high-school movie feeling. The beauty, the misunderstood, the quarterback, the nerd and the misterious. Like common guys, this is so damn boring.The movie keeps going round and round, one scene worse than the other. Honestly I was tempted to just quit watching because I physically couldn't handle the cringe of absolute horrible ""jokes"" and ""coolness"". At one point I lay at the ground in embryo pose, because that last boss fight...i already tried to erase this from my mind.
Because who where they fighting again? Ah screw it...i forgot it already because this villian character was absolute brutally flat and boring with no backstory whatsoever.1 star is too much already to be honest.",Power Rangers

I have always had a grudging liking of the campy and slightly cheesy style of the Power Rangers and while I'm not a massive fan of superhero/comic book themed movies I can usually watch them just for the pace and fun but this movie had none of that. Nothing. OK so it gets a couple of points for having as its heroes a slightly autistic kid, another who brings in a LGBT aspect, and a brief look at the issues of bullying, of both the social media and standard varieties, which is great for a movie aimed at younger audiences, but these positive points are lost in the interminably lackluster entire rest of the movie.",Power Rangers

333,nenadperovic-1,Great remake of a kids classic!,10,16 June 2017,"Seeing how insultingly low rating this movie has I gave it a 10 and I stand by it. Having watched this movie and having read the reviews for it I feel compelled to say something. This movie was never supposed to be serious or ""what is the meaning of life deep"". This is an excellent retelling of a classic story that some of was followed when we were kids. Granted the original was far far faaaar more ridiculous than this but it didn't matter when we were little kids. All we knew was, Rita-bad, rangers-good. So if you are going to watch this movie with the expectation that it will somehow change your view of the world or make you think, watch Life of Pi or something like that. But if you want to have a nostalgia moment and see your favorite childhood heroes kick some butt then I highly recommend this movie. It was great fun watching this on the big screen with a better script than any of the original rangers ever had. So if you want to have some fun, enjoy. If not, don't compare it to Schindler's list and tell me it sucks. Compare it to Iron man, Pacific Rim and then tell me how it good/bad it is.

No kid who sees this for the first time is gonna fall in love with it like they did the original show.They blew it. They had the opportunity to make something that could stand on its own against big robot movies like The Transformers or superhero ensembles like The Avengers but now won't even be noticed alongside these movies.

As for the people who are complaining that it's not the 90s or the humor is too grown up, they are just being to critical and flat out picky; honestly, if it even resembled the 90s stuff I wouldn't have even given it a chance.I say watch it, it won't disappoint but if it does well it's you because it is a ""Power Rangers"" movie so how high was your bar really set in the first place??

339,metalcactus667,Not a bad start.,7,20 August 2017,"Super hero origin films need to introduce you to both the origin of the hero as well as the origin of the villain and come up with a finale. Most super hero TV shows, cartoons and comics are simply good guys vs bad guys via fighting it out, these guys have giant robots as extension of that. So what were you expecting with this one?Rather than like the TV show where evil is unleashed and the good guy mentor summons an unlikely team, the movie fleshed out a random group of people who aren't initially friends, who come together by chance and discover something long buried away that leads them to gaining enhanced abilities. Upon further investigation a potential purpose is then discovered.This team is recruited and tasked with saving the world in a matter of days but they find they must grow as a team in order to earn the worthy right to unlock the full potential of being a ranger. So don't expect them to jump straight into being seasoned heroes from the start.As a fan of the original series I was open to an updated movie version that I knew wouldn't be the same, and for the most part it was fairly entertaining as things kept moving. It wasn't perfect, but it was a fun exploration movie. I'd sooner watch this again than Batman v Superman.If they do a sequel it won't be bogged down with origin story and can focus more on the plot of the threat.The ranger suits looked good, but they could have done with more, or a longer scene of showcasing that section. The zords were a lot better than the CGI zords in the original movie. Though they did look a bit small at times. Goldar was probably the only real bad design in this remake, but mainly if you were a fan of the original. I think Rita could have done with a normal Goldar to have some dialogue with before sending him on a giant rampage.Expectations are what ruin anything, especially if you are hung up on the original source. It's not too serious and not too silly. From the studio that it came from I'd say it wasn't a bad effort. Certainly better than any over blown over expensive transformers sequel film.",Power Rangers
340,jonpat94,Breath of new life in a classic franchise,10,6 August 2017,"A thoroughly enjoyable re-imagining of the classic cheesy power rangers. Rather than rely entirely on dusty nostalgia for its appeal, 2017's Power Rangers brings the franchise into a new era, for a new generation of young people to enjoy. The inclusion of several difficult themes, such as unhealthy home life & familial relationships, single-parent homes, and parental illness, is a bold statement that sends the message ""you can be a hero no matter where you come from"". Outstanding even above the film's portrayal of difficult home life and the difficulty of the teenage years is the film's portrayal of Billy Cranston, a young man with autism. His autism is directly addressed and is never shown as a weakness or a fault - indeed, Billy is the uniting force that pulls the team together on multiple occasions throughout the film. For a major Hollywood film, with such a cherished history, to show an openly neurodivergent character and not portray him in a negative light, is a dramatic and bold move on the part of the filmmakers - and one that is extremely welcome in a world where neurodivergence is treated like a dirty word.With a cast of well-acted and well-written characters, tremendous CGI, and just enough references to the original series and films sprinkled in, 2017's Power Rangers is a fantastically fun and often emotionally stirring film.

My favorite part was the character development between the five leads. All five actors were excellent especially Billy played by RJ Cyler. I like how most of the movie was about them earning their powers rather than just having it handed to them. I also have a few minor nitpicks though.

Yes, they could have done a better job, but considering this so called 'director' is in play, they did a bang up job. I wish them the very best for any future roles they may star in.Now onto the movie itself. The story was limited and disappointing as they have a history with some of us fans and many a story in the history of the Power Rangers. They could have picked any of them and considering we have CGI at our disposal, they could have dreamed up something with much more impact. The Power Rangers are an iconic super hero team from the 90's and we expected much more from this movie. It was supposed to bring our memories of the Power Rangers back to life with a much more realistic adaptation of the 90's TV series. Sadly they have gone down the Green Lantern road and totally butchered our expectations of a 2017 Power Rangers adaptation.I cannot recommend watching it, without preparing you for disappointment and wanting your money back.

I mean, it's like being handed a winning recipe, the ingredients, step-by- step directions, and a multi-person team to cook it.... and still fail miserably at it.Bottom line... There is really no excuse for a studio and/or director to produce trash like this. It's almost having to go out of your way to make it so awful.I don't want to give any spoilers, so I can instead say this honestly- It's just all bad. Dull actors to which we feel no connection, more annoyed by them if anything. Horrific CGI, yet almost all of the 2 whole fight scenes that amount to about 15 minutes of the film are that crap CGI. Yes, you read correctly, this movie is almost over before they even become power rangers and have their ""final (only) battle""... the ending of which is SO stupid, it makes you wonder if this movie is really a satire or parody than an actual, serious movie. It's more like a horribly cheesy teen drama that is trying WAY to hard to be cool. It reminds me nothing of the series at all other than retaining the names and using terms like power rangers and zords... Alpha, Zordon, Rita, the putties, and the Zords are almost unidentifiable... It's hilariously pathetic, really. Rita and Zordons ridiculous new origin stories are an example of the studio trying too hard, but just digging the hole deeper. The 5 minutes of screen time for the Mega Zord is a total let down because it doesn't even show it come together like the TV show and it doesn't look like a mega zord, but way more like one of the Transformers. There is no climax, tension, or suspense... most of it is hearing lame one liners from the cast, or watching them try to be extra cool. That mixed in with every one of them wanting to show us they are ""badasses"" by being rebellious teens who are too much for normal school, so they have to stay in detention all year, also by breaking the law repeatedly, underage drinking, using every cuss word they can think of, trying hard to play that sex appeal angle, and actually describing a bestiality scene that just happened off camera... WHAT?! However, the power ""discs"" (that are definitely not morphers) chose them because they are ""pure of heart"" lolololol... and that's the 1 thing the studio got right (at least in their minds they think it's getting it right) which is using all kinds of tired movie clichés and absurd, out of nowhere plot devices that both progress the story AND miraculously saves them a couple of different times from what appears to be certain death. Of course, these devices and plot holes are barely even mentioned, most times there was no bother to explain these select impossible moments to the audience..... It's like there were deleted scenes in a couple of parts almost, missing info.This MOVIE is a JOKE!It's an insult since it's an obvious cash grab, sponsored by Krispy Kreme. I cant remember how many times the words ""Krispy Kreme"" were said in this movie, and the krispy kreme building had more screen time than the action sequences. It was also central to the plot of the entire movie. Its clear the studio didn't even try to make it half way decent, they just wanted an ""Insta-Blockbuster/Franchise""",Power Rangers

361,fzhu-96180,Better than expected,9,11 October 2017,"I didn't hear much buzz about the movie before I saw it on Blu Ray, thought it would be a below par reboot but it actually turned out to be PRETTY DAMN GOOD. This is a well directed movie, quite a few long takes, sharp visuals, got the vibe that it was made with love. Whoever made this went well above the standard that Hollywood usually maintains for movies like this. The cast is charismatic and I found myself caring for the characters and their relationship to each other - probably because there was no one obnoxious/arrogant/apathetic main character. I assumed Jason was going to be the typical arrogant jock turned hero but his first scene in detention where he meets Billy makes him instantly likable and a sort of person you would want to befriend in real life. The female cast is great, Naomi Scott reminds me of a much better/sane version of an ex and quite happy to see so many fresh faces (have never seen any of the 5 in anything before) - these big budget movies usually have at least one big face to draw in audiences so nice to see risks being taken in both the director + actor roles.Overall, pleasantly surprised. I regret not catching this in the cinemas. Decent music to boot.",Power Rangers

365,Daniels_review,The Review,6,4 March 2021,"What do we have here...?
To be honest: Nothing special. This movie can be split in two parts. In the first part you see the Teenagers becoming the Power Rangers, in the second part the fight.The first part is more interesting then you would think for a superhero movie. It shows you the life of every single character and the struggles they have to deal with. All of this is needed so they can finally form up to a team and become the rangers. This part is good if you like stuff like this. Its about teenagers so it come a bit cheesy. (Every single one of them is a misfit and they open up about it.) The big problem is, that even in one and a half hours you can't fit the story of 5 people AND the story of the whole power rangers thing. So even if this is an important part it falls a bit flat. (And you end up with a hard time remembering even all of the five names.The second part is about the fight. And sadly it looses everything for me. Im serious, the fight scenes are just not good. Started interesting when they fight in their suits but goes downhill when they got into their zords.Watching it you could thinks that this is a movie for children/teenagers (I mean.... You know...?) What really bothers me about it, is the first scene where you find a joke about one guy jerk off a cow. So is it for kids? Or not?Conclusion: If this is for children or teenagers the film in it self is ok (just the first scene...) if this is for adults, then it is actually bad. So you can watch it, just don't expect too much from it. The character part is good, the fight part is really bad. So don't go for the fights, go for the story. If you don't want this, then better don't watch it.",Power Rangers

368,timfongmk,Donut Rangers,7,25 March 2017,"I went into the theater expecting a gritty reboot, but the film surprised me with its lighthearted humor and characters who wear their hearts on their sleeves.I am glad, that, unlike other reboots of beloved franchises in recent years, Power Rangers 2017 never pretentiously strives to be more than its source material, or reinvent the wheel. In doing so, it manages to capture some of the spirit of the original series, although there were times the lack of gravitas gave me the feeling of a made for TV movie. But alas, the cheesy set up, the straight forward storytelling, and unlikely friends overcoming the odds was part of the charm of the original power rangers, and retaining these elements is no sin in my book.Despite the main cast being teens, I felt the camaraderie the humor (especially from Billy, a subdued, modern day Steve Urkel), was just believable and entertaining enough to shape the rangers into likable characters without too much annoying angst or soap. Breakfast Club Lite, if you will. The trade off is its all a bit cloying and somewhat limited in its exploration of the team's individual personalities.To balance out the feel good teens, Elizabeth Banks is fabulously fun as the nasty (literal) golddigger vilainess Rita Repulsa, straddling the fine line between gross, evil, and over the top corny, with a bit of sexy thrown in. Almost any scene in the movie with her involved is a highlight.But alas, for the nerd in me, this movie's biggest sin is that there's not enough ranger action. Or any action, period. With a training montage and a few brief fights sprinkled in between, the movie only brings out the big guns for its finale. The Power Rangers in their suits barely get any fighting in against poorly designed enemies that block out much of the screen much of the time. And when it all finally goes to hell, the final setpiece is disappointingly on the generic side, in a post Michael Bay Transformers sort of way. Large CG metal and rock pieces flash across the screen without the viewer really able to distinguish the details, a far cry from the low budget but excellently choreographed sentai action sequences from the original Japanese production.Ultimately, Power Rangers 2017 is the most expensive made for Saturday morning TV movie you will ever watch. Those looking for deep world building, a sharply written script, or jam packed back to back action scenes will not find it here. But those hoping to relive their childhood for a couple hours, and maybe introduce their little on to it, might find a lot of heart and a silly fun time to be had.",Power Rangers

377,ksuever_009,It's not like the 90s kids show... and that is a good thing!,8,24 March 2017,"Before I begin, I must tell you one of the biggest spoilers of this movie. IT'S NOT LIKE THE TV SHOW FROM THE 90s! If you grew up watching it like I did, this will be a little different than the one our generation grew up with. Trust me when I tell you, that's a good thing. Imagine if Batman movies still had the likeness of Adam West's portrayal of Batman from the 60s! It would be lame and people would get sick of it! That being said, let's dive in!THE TV SHOW VS THE MOVIE This movie still has the core values that make up the lore of the Power Rangers: They still morph. They still have to join forces as a team to stop evil. They still need to call on their Zords when they need more power. Rita is still out to destroy the world and take over. Goldar makes an appearance, but he doesn't speak.The things that separate this movie from the TV show are: They don't have fighting skills starting out; they have to train. They are given super powers like strength and speed that let them punch harder, jump higher and so on. They can't morph at first because they don't have the skill to do so. They need to draw the power out that exist inside of them. Zordon even makes them feel bad about it by saying ""If you can't morph, you aren't rangers."" What a jerk! LOLTHE PLOT The movie opens up with Zordon (Bryan Cranston) fighting Rita, and losing. In his last attempt to stop her, he knocks her into the ocean and she is in a state of hibernation until present day. Zordon, with his last breaths, seals away the power coins, or rocks if you'd prefer, for a future team of rangers to find. Skip ahead to present day and you see Jason, Kimberly, and Billy all in Saturday morning detention. They all made mistakes, and they all are paying for it. They eventually meet the other two members of the team, Zack and Trini at a digging site. Billy's father died and I assume he was a scientist of some sort. Billy has a fascination with rocks and blows into some rocks and the team discovers the power crystals. When he blew the rocks that exposed the crystals, security forces were called in to find out who was playing around with explosives. The team escapes in Billy's mother's minivan. As they approach a train crossing they attempt to make it but don't. Oddly, they all wake up at home but notice they have powers. They all meet up at the site again and find the secret lair to Zordon's fortress. They encounter Alpha-5 (BTW HE DOES SAY ""AYE, YI, YI, YI, YI!"" He says it once, and it's not annoying!) They are introduced to Zordon's essence; which is another way of saying the original Zordon is gone, but he can still come back. Zordon wants the new rangers to help him come back, but to do that, they need to prove they are capable of morphing. Morphing, apparently comes from the inside out. It sounds cheesy, but it looks awesome! The group cannot do it and so, Zordon makes them train without armor. They get the snot beaten out of them! It makes it more realistic from the viewer's standpoint. They didn't ask for this, they didn't want this, they are just kinda rolling with it, and they eventually earn the role. (It reminds me of Spider-man, the Toby McGuire films.) They were gifted powers they don't know how to use because they never had them before. It makes you want to see them toughen up and grow as super heroes! After going through that process, Alpha-5 shows them the Zords ""when you're ready, you will pilot these,"" he tells them. Zack can't wait, and he steals one and drives it, horribly. Later that night, Rita visits Trini at home and threatens to kill her if she doesn't tell Rita where the Zeo Crystals are. Rita mocks Trini because she cannot morph, and then offers her to join Rita against Zordon. She gives her an ultimatum, and requests that she meet her to make her decision. Rita threatens that ""tomorrow I will destroy your city."" Trini meets with the other rangers and tells them about the encounter. They meet Rita and try to fight her without armor and get their butts handed to them. She kills Billy after finding out from him, where the crystals are located. The team take Billy to Zordon and then, because of their efforts, acting as real rangers, Zordon can return. He doesn't. He uses that power to bring Billy back to life. The rangers morph and then head out to stop Rita. They use their skills and armor to beat down Putties, and eventually call on their Zords. They stop Rita by combining their Zords. When they defeat Rita, she tells the rangers that ""others will come, it won't be just me!"" (I hope she means Lord Zed!). Jason asks her to give up her power crystal and staff, and surrender to Zordon. She refuses, and they literally B!@CH SLAP her into space. As she ascends into space, she hibernates again, turning to ice.FINAL THOUGHTS This movie is nothing like the TV show I grew up with in the 90s. I have fond memories of that show from when I was a kid, but it matured. For that I am thankful! It was fun to watch, and it brought the little kid inside of me out. My kids loved it, and I can certainly say it exceeded my expectations! It's not like the show I remembered, but that's okay. It's actually better IMHO.

Sheldon from Big Bang, Shaun from The Good Doctor...if they can show ASD properly you could have, too.You had an incredible opportunity to show inclusivity for people with real traits, but you squandered it. Even worse though, while shows like BBT and TGD make real efforts to show significant traits so that the general public might come away with some idea of the real life issues ASD people contend with, you instead marginalized it and trivialized it.On top of all this, many of your hardcore fans are on the spectrum. Shame on you. I'm very grateful my son went the Transformers route so he would not have been let down but your utter disregard for people with this disorder. As an aside, my 20 y/o ASD son, who personally connects with Sheldon but to a much higher degree with Shaun, watched this movie recently.

Is it for someone like me in his late 20s-early 30's, a long-time Power Rangers fan, and someone who grew up on the original Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers? No. The only thing that nods it's head at us is a brief 1-second cameo of the original rangers at the end. There is no classic over-the-top action, no martial arts motiff, no swift and rhythmic hand gesturing, no announcement morphing (or hardly any morphing for that matter), and no cool, stellar combat scenes. Not even a flip or an extreme sports sequence. Lastly, they never played the power rangers theme song. Instead, the theme consisted of long, synthesized space riffs. It didn't fit for Power Rangers at all.Then is it for kids, a younger, new generation? No way. It's terrible. It has no plot. The characters are brash stereotypes, the dialogue is awful and it's not even kid-appropriate.Is it for action fans? Again, not a chance. This movie had maybe two minutes of fighting, I want to say. And it's not even like Wonder Woman or BvS, which were both short on fighting sequences but what they had were pretty good. The rest was....I don't know, teens trying to ""find themselves"", and they do that by finding each other, I guess? And becoming Power Rangers?To sum up, this movie had no right to be produced. At the pre-production phase someone should have asked: who is our audience? In fact, it's a very simple question that should have been asked by the person doing the screenplay, the director, and the producer. It could have saved a lot of agony and a classic brand and franchise from becoming a heap of garbage. The original Power Rangers didn't take itself too seriously. It was about being cool and being bad-ass, flipping around and fighting bad guys, and at the end of the day, jumping in a gigantic robot and taking part in a Godzilla-esque duel in downtown Angel Grove. This one is too touchy feely and not enough kung-pow!A proper Power Rangers reboot should have over-the-top action, classic branding, and be a tribute to the classic Power Rangers.

I liked the whole backstory they created with Zordon and Rita and this movie had interesting interpretations of them. I think keeping Rita closer to the way she was on the TV show would've worked also rather than this version who was much more sinister and out to kill, but this version of Rita did work pretty well for the movie. The ranger actors were all great, and I liked that they were given more dimension than they were on the show. I liked too how they showed them becoming friends and learning to work together, when in the show they're one-dimensional and they kind of just come together out of nowhere just because they were chosen to be rangers. I do think Billy should've been more like how he was on the show though, I didn't get enough of a nerd vibe from this movie's version. Alpha 5 had a few funny lines, but I don't think Bill Hader's voice worked for him.My biggest issue with the movie is that it was too much about the civilian teens and there wasn't enough Power Rangers action. Far too much of the movie is about the rangers as civilians, and they only morph an hour and a half into the movie. There should have been some battles against some of the show's classic monsters leading up to the big one against Goldar and Rita. Instead they go right to big battle, and even that it doesn't last long enough. They go from struggling to control the Megazord to destroying Goldar and sending Rita into space. Overall I will say it's a decent movie, but it needed to have more... Power Rangers in it. It should've been a little closer to the show, should've had more morphed action. The Power Rangers loving kid in me is pretty disappointed, but it was a good enough effort to turn the franchise into a big budget superhero movie with more character depth set in today's world.",Power Rangers

386,segasonic015,Go Go to your local Cinema.,6,28 March 2017,"Power Rangers isn't a ground-breaker in the superhero genre. But in an era of Hollywood rebooting properties from our past, most of which being plain and lackluster, it shifted my expectations into turbo, coming off as a heartfelt and fun surprise. The best part about this reboot of the cheesy 90's phenomenon is that it adds more depth to the lore and characters of its franchise. Dean Israelite, who previously directed the indie sci-fi flick, Project Almanac, managed to add his greatest strength to the rangers; making their personalities and situations more believable and realistic. Each of them are misfits, having their own little quirks and stories that they must venture through to become the team they were meant to be. The solid acting from the main cast helps as well, with additional shout-outs to the hammy and deliciously evil Elizabeth Banks and goofy Bill Hader.I'm also appreciative of the film's tone. Some say it's uneven, and while there are some unexpectedly dark moments in the film (most involving Rita, who is more of a threat this time around), there's still plenty of chuckle-worthy moments of humor and fun. A lot better than just being dumb or overly dark/gritty. My only real complaint is that the film doesn't fully embrace Power Rangers' silliness at times. Some of the fan-service (like the original theme) is neat, but other times, it can feel forced in for the sake of it. The Rangers don't morph until the last act of the film, a move that I'm not particularly angry about since it feels earned, but I can imagine some would be really bothered by this. It doesn't help that, aside from a few moments here and there, the action sequence between the Rangers and Rita's fleet can go into Transformers-levels of mindless CGI sewage.Aside from that, I believe that Power Rangers is a fun time at worst, and a surprisingly good superhero origin at best. I'm having a hard time believing that I'm saying this to a Power Rangers movie, but times change, I suppose.P.S. There's a massive plug in this movie for Krispy Kreme Doughnuts, so much so that it's integral to the film's plot.

I have never been happier to be proved wrong.She played the role of Trini perfectly and made her character someone that, I think, a lot of people can relate to. Naomi Scott as Kimberly was perfect casting. I loved her in Lemonade Mouth when I was younger so I was excited when I heard that she was cast in Power Rangers. She played the role of Kimberly very well and I definitely will be looking for her more in the future. Everyone did very well in their roles but to me, and I'm sure a lot of you, RJ Cyler stole the show. His portrayal of Billy was perfect. Billy was a very important character being the first superhero to be on the autism spectrum and RJ Cyler absolutely nailed it.Something that I personally am not a fan of in movies is a lot of CGI but, I got to say this movie pulled it off. It wasn't cheesy and went with the movie very well. I also have to mention the soundtrack in the film. every song fit the moment perfectly and added that extra bit to the movie. This movie was about all the characters becoming the Power Rangers and evolving. It takes a long time before they actually become the Power Rangers. The reason for doing this is to show how all of the characters develop throughout the movie which I think was a very dog move. Every character develops really well personally as well as a group. I really hope there is a sequel as the end set it up perfectly. At the end of this movie it shows the teacher at detention introduce a new character, Tommy. Introducing this character would be a good fit for the next movie (if there is one.) If they do decide to do another movie we will be able to see the rangers more experienced and, if they do decide to make Tommy a ranger, we can see how they adjust to the new addition.",Power Rangers
392,PowerRangersAreSTOOPID,An awful reboot of an already awful television show!,1,22 March 2017,"Before I review the film, lets go back to the beginning of the awful television show.Mighty Morphin Power Rangers started airing on Fox Kids. Its true genesis was as an Americanized version of a long running Japanese kids show called Super Sentai which premiered back in 1975.Mighty Morphin Power Rangers (with its bad 1990s haircuts, fashion, and earrings) merged original Japanese footage from two Super Sentai shows called Zyuranger and Dairanger with absolutely horrid American footage that was a bad Saved By The Bell knock off which eventually joined Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles as the latest craze on Fox Kids. The third season, which ripped off Kakuranger, had the power rangers turned into children and replaced by ""ninja"" aliens. (Are you kidding me?!)Fast forward to 2017. Power Rangers has lost most of its former popularity, so greedy plagiarist Haim Saban decides to reboot ""his"" power rangers (which was never ""his"" in the first place, it belonged to Toei who originally created Super Sentai/power rangers) the same way Ninja Turtles was ""rebooted"" for the big screen a couple of years ago.This time, the new cast is completely dysfunctional and the first 90 minutes are a real DRAG ripping off other teen angst movies so much that many kids will undoubtedly find it BORING. (Which they did in my screening!) Its far more Chronicle/Fant4stic than power rangers.Elizabeth Banks is the only one doing decent work as the new Rita Repulsa, a former Power Ranger looking to revive her giant monster Goldar. Even Bryan Cranston is miscast and looks lost here as Zordon!The ending does finally bring the audience its goofy power rangers (in the last ten minutes!) with even more ridiculous plastic costumes than the cheesy Zyuranger spandex on the old show and bargain basement, combining video game CGI visual effects for the end battle which really DOES looks like another Playstation 2 game.The word CHEESE cannot describe how eye rolling and preposterous the ending is. (A megazord slap into outer space PUL-EEZZE)!Not to mention the endless Krispy Kreme references/placements are downright embarrassing.Do the world a favor watch a far superior comic book movie like Logan instead and save your money!Power rangers was a HUGE disappointment, its poor box office worldwide proves it. (A sequel is VERY unlikely now!)A one on a scale of 1-10.Power Rangers is another box office BOMB for Lionsgate, which was on a roll after the great John Wick sequel.",Power Rangers

394,ssingh-50552,Just plain and utter garbage.,1,13 June 2017,"The thing I found the most annoying about this movie was the fact that even after being a big budget movie the CGI was worse than I could have ever imagined. The big baddie at the end and the megazod looked more like old video game characters.However, it is not just the CGI. It seemed like the writers and director just wanted to cash in on the name and didn't work at all on the script as well as acting. The rangers were plain bad actors portraying mediocre acting skills at best. The script was floozy and it is only after the entry of Rita Repulsa (Elizabeth Banks) that I thought that maybe this movie will turn out to be good.The film takes too much time to build up and we have to sit through the bad acting, boring dialogues and what appears to be The Breakfast Club reunion. The middle parts feel good at some points but are too dragged out for the viewer to care. Although there are some effective scenes but they are not enough to save the whole movie. The rangers spend at max 10 minutes in their suits after which the zords come into play. The last half hour which should have been explosive action (think Transformers) was dialed down to a stupid fight which didn't seem as threatening as they wanted us to feel.The only saving grace come at the start of the movie which I should say hyped me for a real bad movie. Elizabeth Banks shines in the beginning but seems to be over acting for the rest of the movie. It also doesn't help when your villain isn't seen fighting in the end and is just seen as a moot spectator.In my opinion, Power Rangers is what Transformers would have been if it had the bad CGI. The movie battled between being darker and grittier while simultaneously trying to be like the old power rangers. An amateur cast, the bad CGI and the lousy script make up for a really bad movie experience.",Power Rangers

It is exactly the right blend of fun and exciting, while being dark and challenging at the same time. It is also LITTERED with fan bait with original theme song and all. Absolutely loved this movie and will be seeing it again before it leaves cinemas. Hoping it makes enough money to warrant sequels (opening weekend suggests it will) because they have such a good grounding here to just go to town on all the sequels (7 as reported earlier) they have planned. 9/10 for me.",Power Rangers

Where every single episode was formulaic and the characters were 1-dimensional. They fixed a lot in this movie, making the Rangers powerful and keeping it funny at the same time! I think it's Patton Oswalt that does the voice of Zordon's helper robotand they kept the Aieee aie yaie yaie yie (spell? Lol). They kept all that was good and got rid of what was bad, and even poked fun of it, in the reboot. I need like two more sequels, please!",Power Rangers
397,crafterj,It was a great movie all around,10,25 March 2017,"For a guy born in the late 90's I caught the tail end of the original Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, I've seen it all by now and I have to say this movie does a great job representing the original feeling it gave me as a kid. It also had really deep character moments and so much amazing character growth. The representation of both the autistic spectrum and the LGBTQ spectrum was beautiful and suited the rangers great. The Rangers have always been diverse and now it's in more than just race. The costumes were amazing and the zords were even cooler. If I had to gripe about anything it's the way the rangers were inside the megazord but I can live with that no problem. Seeing what they did with Rita was pure gold and the two cameos in this film was fan service at its best. They felt like power rangers and the way the movie made it fit in with the times was perfect. I want to go back for more of this movie, can't wait for the sequel!",Power Rangers
398,deanooax,Great start for the new generation of power rangers,7,29 March 2017,"I have to say I was looking forward to this movie ever since it was announced and it met up to the expectation I had. The acting from MOST of the cast was extremely good and they had some passion which payed off on there part. The movie had humour and it had familiarity to the rangers. As they are all misfits it gave them more of an edge which made you connect more to them and it just worked well. The cgi on parts wasn't all so great though, it was like watching scenes from gods of Egypt it was that bad but some scenes where OK and it wasn't that bothering. The biggest disappointment was Elizabeth banks. She should not of Been cast for the part of Rita as she fetched way too much cheese to the role. she lacked the passion in here role and it felt like she was just doing the film for a quick buck. Sometimes comedy actors do play good villains and sometimes they just fail tremendously and she failed. The end verdict is go see it as it is worth a cheeky one time watch.",Power Rangers

400,georgeskoufezis,Spoiler Free Review: SABANS' POWER RANGERS (2017),8,25 April 2017,"SPOILER FREE REVIEW: 25/04/2017 SABANS' POWER RANGERS (2017) I thought I would get this off my chest while it is still fresh and imprinted in the memory. Last night I was lucky enough to see the newest installment of the Power Rangers phenomenon with some close friends and better company. I proceeded to purchase my tickets online and book my spot in the cinema (as I usually do), boy I'm glad I did that as good seating was hard to find. I represented my strong liking to the franchise by wearing a custom made Red Ranger tee and even brought with me my Legacy Red Ranger helmet and Morpher. Enough about the lead up and its proceedings, now to the movie...Before watching a film like this, with such a large and multicultural fan base you can't help but have preconceived opinions and thoughts. Director Dean Israelite, who previously directed ""Project Almanac"" chose to go with a cast that didn't necessarily have the major Hollywood power compared to your Marvel or DC Films.Did this work? Would a well-known Hollywood actor suit the role better? Simply put, no.I think that the young, fairly inexperienced cast of Power Rangers worked extremely well together and were one of the key highlights to this movie. Dacre Montgomery (Jason Lee Scott, Red Ranger), Naomi Scott (Kimberly Hart, Pink Ranger), RJ Cyler (Billy Cranston, Blue Ranger), Ludi Lin (Zack Taylor, Black Ranger) and Becky G (Trini Kwan, Yellow Ranger) almost seemed to possess that misfit persona that seemingly worked for the movie's plot. Each of them has a different personality and this is shown by their corresponding Ranger colour. The manner in which the cast plays off one another feels almost natural, to see on the big screen and after a rocky start, they soon become a family.The movie does provide a viewer a slight backstory on the lore of Power Rangers, their wise and selfless mentor, Zordon (played by Brian Cranston), the everlasting evil and manipulative Rita Repulsa (played by Elizabeth Banks). This ensured that if you were watching Power Rangers for the first time (apart from the endless catalogue of TV series that exist) then you were catered for.Director Israelite spent a fair chunk of the movie working on the Rangers' relationship with one another and their connection to the Power Coins (the colour coins that grant them power) and the Morphing Grid (the process in which they Morph into their warriors). This was definitely done so that viewers, new to the franchise would be caught up and can enjoy the rest of the film.Once the movie did move on to the villain development and the Morphtastic fighting sequences, it felt kind of rushed, especially the last stanza between the Rangers and Goldar (Rita's monster creation). Perhaps this is to blame on the 2 hour duration of the film, having to try and wow viewers in such a short time, but albeit I think it was done well. The Rangers had an opportunity to show off their fighting skills and Zord abilities (mechanical animals they pilot) and bid perfect nostalgia to people like me. This fighting, accompanied by the cliché humour and poking jokes throughout the film make the latest installment of Power Rangers an enjoyable ride while it lasted.Was this a Hollywood blockbuster, primed to win multiple awards? Probably not, but was this a good introduction to a modern Power Rangers franchise? I definitely think so.Putting all biasness aside I have gone with the following score.8/10",Power Rangers
401,tharungs,Good one for Time pass !!,7,18 June 2017,"The movie sometimes uses the Marvel template but I would say that it still manages to be fun and bold at the same time.

402,sdonancricchia,It was a bit on the meh side,4,19 June 2017,"I liked the beginning 3 minutes and kind of liked the development of the kid's personal life, but we could have carved a bit of that down. For a movie about martial artists and fighting and all that stuff, there was very little fighting. The emphasis on training should have been moot. The suits and coins should have implanted all that in their brains. I mean, if there is a part 2, possibly could be a better flick. I think today's movies spend way too much time telling the story. We all know who the Power Rangers are and honestly, it could be explained much quicker. I found the movie to be OK, probably will never watch it again and quite boring.",Power Rangers

I'm only 19 and I hate to say it but this new generation isn't like the 90's. There are more kids know that are into this new behavior that you saw in the movie. For example with the cursing and dirty jokes and other things like that, is what kids now a days are into. I just graduated high school so I know a little of how the kids in this generation react to and what there into. I really think they should continue with the next seven movies if it actually comes to that many because know that the first movie with the introduction is over there may also be more action and more things that will make the series more popular with the next movies. I am a little interested in what they plan on doing with people that were in the original TV series and movies. For example Bulk and skull and others.

409,odin_leonhart,Not disappointed at all,7,26 May 2017,"Alright, the 2017 Power Rangers movie that half the internet was waiting for, a reboot that is based on the first season(s) of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. After seeing the first trailer I knew that I needed to watch this movie. While friends kept saying that I shouldn't get my expectations high up. After seeing the first trailer and the first pictures of the suits, I felt it was going to be more serious than the series. Nice upgrade of the suits, while I thought that they could've made the helmets more recognizable. Anyway; seeing the movie gave me a satisfied feeling. The ""stereotypes"" were still intact (high school football player, cheerleader, nerdy tech guy, the daredevil etc), the diversity of ethnic backgrounds was still there like in most of the Power Rangers series. Even what I thought was lacking in the series in general, was put in the movie in a good way. A 2 hour Power Rangers movie sounded good, but I thought that the first half was going a bit too slow. You want to get to know the characters, but it was a little bit too long. The second half was better, with the final 15 minutes being really packed with action. Unfortunately the movie was pretty much over after that, but I think that a sequel would be in it's place as they can skip the introductions of the main cast and focus on the story. I didn't expect the movie to be on the action level of something like the Avengers and the MCU, but it was good. With a lot of things still not done yet, they can use a potential sequel to answer the things fans still want to see. At least I would go to a sequel of this. The main story of the Power Rangers compared to the MMPR series is pretty much in tact, the upgraded setting did pretty well, but there is room for improvement for everything. To be fair, it could've been worse. I would've rated it 6,5 but since we round the ratings, it gets a 7 from me.",Power Rangers

But but this movie in 2017 is extremely dumb, has no logic-you can't find it even if you try hard. The rangers are some lame kids that want to look like they have so many problems, they don't know any martial arts since the beginning and voila they are fighting, the girls are fat and short and lame. Zordon makes no sense, so powerful and lost and this new facebook kids destroyed Rita???!!!

414,TheBowmanDude,An Enjoyable Modern Take On The Classic 90's Show,7,25 March 2017,"Like pretty much every other kid that grew up in the 90's I watched the crap out of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. Between the series itself and 1995's Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie, Power Rangers was a huge part of my childhood so going into this movie I was cautiously optimistic and I'm happy to say that while its not a perfect movie it completely exceeded my expectations and was for the most part a pretty good movie.The Main Cast of this movie all have fantastic chemistry with one another. The rangers them selves all deliver very good performances and we get a really good look into each of their characters. Dacre Montgomery, Naomi Scott, and RJ Tyler, who play the Red, Pink, and Blue Ranger respectively definitely stood out the most.. While the Ludi Lin and Becky G, who play the Black and Yellow Rangers, also do a great job the other 3 really get the most development out of the 5. Now one thing I always thought was funny about the original series was that the rangers were supposed to be ""Teenagers with Attitude"" but since at the end of the day it was a kids show the rangers were all model teen students that would routinely help with food drives and any and all other community service projects. They were basically these larger than life role models for kids to look up to, However this time around we get characters that actually feel realistic. Throughout the movie each ranger is dealing with his or her own personal issues. They're not perfect by any means, they are a group of Misfits that barely know each other and are just trying to figure out their place in the world and this approach to the characters really adds some depth to the movie. Basically if The Breakfast Club and Chronicle had a kid that movie would be Power Rangers.Supporting cast wise Elisabeth Banks does a great job as the villainous Rita Repulsa. In the series she was an over the top space witch and while the movie does make a change to her back story some of that over the top cheesiness remains and its entertaining to watch. Bryan Cranston as Zordon was decent, like Rita there are some changes to his backstory that I think worked very well and while his main purpose throughout the film is just pretty much for exposition he still gets a decent bit of character development and growth. Then finally there's Bill Hader as Alpha 5, Zordon's robot assistant. This time around Alpha has a lot more personality than he did in the original show and its definitely for the better, Hader's portrayal of Alpha reminded me a lot of K-2S0 from Star Wars Rogue One, he's very matter of fact and speaks his mind with a good amount of deadpan humor mixed in.Now I do think there were a couple of missed opportunities during the movie primarily that one of the biggest changes to the Rangers Characters is that unlike the original they are given powers that are present even when they aren't in their Ranger forms. Unfortunately though we don't really get to see these powers put to use beyond the reveal that they even exist and one or twice during the rangers training sequence. Now pacing wise the movie as fine, I didn't think it really dragged anywhere but I do think the inclusion of an unmorphed fight scene somewhere in the second act would have been a nice as it could have showcased the rangers enhanced abilities and also could have given a look into the progression of their training before the final confrontation with Rita.As far as the movies action scenes go there really isn't anything until the third act. Everything up until is basically world building and character development which I was actually very OK with, considering the fact that this is a very different take of the Power Rangers and that should this movie do well enough there are plans for five potential sequels. As I mentioned before I would have like a little more action in the movie but once the action does starts its nonstop till the end. Visually all the CGI looked great, from the Rangers in their suits fighting Rita's legion of Putties to their Zords and the eventual Megazord fight it all looked fantastic. There is a mid-credits scene that sets the stage for a sequel should this movie do well enough. So be sure to stay for that.So at the end of the day while Power Rangers isn't going to be winning any awards it was still a very entertaining movie with some great characters and a good action packed third act. If you were or still are a fan of Power Rangers you will definitely want to go see this movie and even if you're not a fan this is still a entertaining movie that's totally worth the ticket price.Check out my video review of ""Power Rangers"" - https://youtu.be/9QcpvwreQTw",Power Rangers

It was awesome that they added a power ranger with autism and made alpha to be more than an aye yay yay! robot. I think it was an above standard reboot, who ever thought they would cry in power rangers movie? When I went to see this in theaters it was full of adult coming back for the nostalgia and was buzzing with energy in the room. When the credits rolled there was clapping and buzz words left and right. I hope they do make this into a series. It was cool to see the kids progress and grow and finally morph. Bad ass fight scenes and great graphics were also a great touch.",Power Rangers

First off I should mention I am a HUGE die-hard fan of the MMPR. I grew up in the 90's and I spent my days pretending to be a power ranger. This movie just brought back so many memories and was very emotional for me, especially with such a powerful anti-bullying message (I wish there was more of that when I was growing up!) The acting was excellent and believable, compared to a lot of other teen movies and shows this one was a big win for me. The amount of references to the franchise was very cool, and any true fan will spot them all. The updates were fantastic and needed, it got less corny and much more realistic. I laughed hard, I teared up a couple times and I had a really, really good time. Win, win win. Can't wait for the next one!",Power Rangers

And i still can't realize: WHAT THE **** DID YOU EXPECT?!This is a REBOOT. A completely new story, just like director said. This is the first movie in a new superhero franchise, and it needs to have a focus on the story and its characters, not on battles and morphing sequences. It's made for everybody except kids, because it's dark and much more serious than the TV show which was made mostly for kids. We have five teenagers and each of them has his own issues he needs to solve himself in order to become a hero (Power Ranger) and save the world. Every next situation in the movie makes our heroes closer to each other and stronger as a team.I personally enjoyed watching this movie because it is dark, amazing, emotional, funny(of course not that much like the TV show), and has AWESOME introduction to the whole story and its main characters. I can only imagine what's planned for the sequel. CAN'T WAIT FOR THAT!!! #GO #GO #POWER #RANGERS",Power Rangers

435,ctowers21,Power Rangers is good for all types of fans,9,24 March 2017,"Power rangers does exactly what it sets out to do. This origin story feels like a breakfast club reboot where the kids get super powers. The relationships in this movie are rarely seen in superhero movies and the actors knock their performances out of the park. All of the story feels real and the audience feels emotionally attached to these characters. The movie is very well directed by Dean Isrealite with all the CGI and background settings looking unlike the power rangers of past. The movie features star like performances from the relatively new faces of the five power rangers with Dacre Montgomery (red), Naomi Scott (pink) and RJ Cyler sticking out. Most of the story is genre defying and sets a tone for the movies to follow,However, Elizabeth banks seems to be completely over acting her entire part. Her cheesy, almost comical representation of Rita make it seem like she is in a different movie and with a completely different tone than the five power rangers along with zordon (played by Bryan Cranston). Her cheesy dialog and facial expressions bring down this movie and makes the audience think what could have been.Overall, this movie has a great amount of heart and tremendous performances from some soon to be stars that leaves the audience craving sequels to this could be great franchise, even with the miss by Elizabeth banks. Whether you were a fan of the original TV show or have no prior knowledge, people will get what they are hoping for out of this potentially massive success of a franchise.",Power Rangers
436,crsimons14,A Fresh Reboot,6,2 January 2019,This is not a masterpiece or an Oscar worthy piece of filmmaking. It is what it was meant to be. A retelling of a 90s era mega hit for all ages. Cheesy at times. Perhaps a little slow for children. A couple of the rangers seemed to be out of place (Black and Yellow) but all in all this was an entertaining reboot for anybody who was a fan of the Mighty Morphing Power Rangers. The movie achieves its number one goal in my opinion. It's actually entertaining. For a Power Ranger Reboot that was good enough for me.,Power Rangers

The way this movie introduced the characters was great, the story was excellent, and the action and humor was masterful to me. I grew up watching the Power Rangers series.

440,JimmyTeller,Coming of age story done well in a CGI fest that fans would approve.,10,23 March 2017,"Power Rangers succeeds as a film that actually cares about character building, unlike the typical Transformers movie that throws you right in the middle of numbing explosions and special effects, or getting too caught up in it's lore. It is never easy to make a character driven movie for an ensemble cast, but director Dean Israelite chose to gamble a majority of the runtime on fleshing out the characters, and it pays off. We are in turn rewarded with an effective, even if somewhat flawed storyline that warms us up to the heroes and allows us to establish an emotional connection with them, from their struggles to their triumph. And the film's climax, non-stop action backed with great music, becomes a hugely rewarding payoff.Israelite, a professed fan of the series, really does get it. He uses reliable tropes of a coming of age, underdog story, and litters the film with the right amount of nostalgia and cheesiness, in all the right places. The film is ultimately funny, nostalgic and uplifting, even if predictable. Fans of the series, watch it with your friends and go in expecting nothing. You just might be overwhelmed as I was.",Power Rangers

And for being a fan since the first day, I'm very happy at the end result if you don't like this movie and your a fan since the beginning as well then you'll be no stranger to the comedy and weirdness/awesomeness that comes from power rangers, for blank sake they meant the teenage mutant ninja turtles But as I sat there in the theater I was just stuck watching the movie and I loved and everything about it I really hope for A lightspeed rescue",Power Rangers
442,theblindkid325,As is the case...,7,4 October 2021,"...with most movies that have Elizabeth Banks in it for more than 5 minutes, it's a stinker. I actually loved this movie until the very moment she appears. He performance is way too over the top and that's considering how ridiculous of a villain Rita was when we watched the 90s version. I think Liz is probably a great human being but there is something that happens to a movie when she's in it for too long (ex: Pitch Perfect vs. Pitch Perfect 2 & 3). Stay behind the camera, or on Press Your Luck. Everything else about this movie went exactly how it should've. It was a complete story, did feel like the budget ran thin towards the end, but they were seeing if they could jump start the franchise. Unfortunately, we may never get that Green Ranger story again, and I think it would have been told splendidly with this team.",Power Rangers

It has a old-timer story with Rita and good fighting the evil with some cool Zorgs. :) It really took me back to childhood, and that cannot be a bad thing. The old Kim and Tommy at the end got me even a bit emotional. :D Just kidding, I am really not a critic and it takes for a movie to be a really big piece of s*** for me not to like it.

Instead what you will be treated to is a movie with a good range of fresh actors, a well-written uplifting story, colorful action and at times slightly funny(not for lack of trying) film. You may be bewildered reading this. Some of you may call it a cheesy, unrealistic, childish pile of crap filled with teenage drama.. well guess what, this a movie remake of a 90's children's TV show about teenagers who are chosen by aliens to defend the earth with suits they can summon out of thin air and giant mech-suits they can drive into battle that are modeled after dinosaurs... its bound to be a little cheesy. That said, I didn't find there to be any unnecessary drama as all of it further developed the characters or plot.I have a lot of respect for the director and writers for staying true to the feel of the old TV show. Being a director in 2017 its much too easy to make another transformers clone with mind-numbingly stupid dialogue and boring exposition which they try (and fail) to compensate for with great action scenes. The actors are written fairly solid, though a little too charismatic for my liking, however their relationship to each other feels like a genuine friendship which could have easily been overlooked and made more ""like transformers"".I would gladly watch a sequel should there be one.",Power Rangers

450,j_costa1985,nerdgasm!,10,18 June 2017,"First I have to counter all the reviews complaining about how this movie is ""not made for kids"". 1.) Its a PG-13 rated movie (not PG) 2.) I saw it with my 8 year old, and didn't find anything wrong with it at all (especially since any of the dumb things the kids did in the movie resulted in actual consequences, so it can be great for teaching your kids life lessons). Unlike all the other movies (even PG ones) where kids do things they shouldn't and get away with it. 3.) The target audience is those of us who grew up with the power rangers (upper 25-40 year olds). Now for MY review: I'm a true rangers fan, even have all their signatures from comicons. THIS is seriously my new favorite movie! It was the most realistic movie so far out of any and all ""super hero"" type movies (they messed up a LOT, first mission was an epic failure, High school kids doing stupid crap actually resulted in REAL consequences...). I also enjoyed that they didn't sexualize the teens, or throw in unnecessary relationships or stupid crap.They didn't white-wash the characters (casting was PERFECT), and even added an LGBT and autistic character into the main crew without it being the focus or a limitation or some political commentary, they just were (OMG! wait for it) NORMAL PEOPLE!! THANK YOU!!It stayed true to the original rangers, but I loved that they modernized it (otherwise it really would have been super cheesy and terrible) and they gave it something new. The effects were AMAZING! I also LOVED the throwbacks they threw in there, so cool! When they said ""it's morphing time"" and later when the original music started playing I was dying! The 90s kid in me was nerdgasaming everywhere Dude seriously!

453,m_kelava,Unbearably hard to stay awake during the entirety of the actual movie,2,17 April 2017,"The whole experience started kind of good. The first 20 minutes were mostly alright, but in my mind what the movie failed to capture as a whole was that the fact it is not the 90s anymore and even tho CGI was decent I failed to find that nostalgia feel that I was in search of when I heard the new Power Rangers movies was coming out. You do not feel anything for the characters and by the end I had felt that it was only starting to get good. It mostly feels like an elderly man tried to make something teenagers would find interesting, but the problem is, that elderly man is stuck in the last century and most of us had moved on. They forgot that kids of today couldn't care less about Power Rangers and that only people like me who used to watch the shows as a kid would be interested tho laziness added to it not being interesting and in my opinion pretty dumb. Characters are stereotypical high school kids you cannot relate too because I guess the writers couldn't bother or were afraid of any backlash had they done anything mildly interesting with them, as we see in all sorts of media today. There are certain points where you can feel what it could have been but those moments drop off pretty quickly and you find yourself either mocking scenes or plainly not caring for the characters or anything really as I did. Overall I cannot give it one star because I had paid to see it, which in my opinion is already too much for something like this, but I think had the characters been interesting as individuals and if the story hadn't felt rushed by the end it might have even been a good movie worthy of my time and nostalgia.",Power Rangers
454,Noahflanny,"A great start, but the film unfortunately begins to show its faults later in the movie",5,23 March 2017,"I didn't come in to this film expecting much, but I was pleasantly surprised when the film began with a very nice start. The build-up and introduction of the first few characters was very well paced and I started to become more interested in the movie, even if it was a generic ""outcast is special"" scenario. Unfortunately, just as I was starting to gain interest, the film started to lose its speed. As I mentioned before, the first few rangers introduced were done very well, and I even felt a bit invested in these characters. The remaining rangers, however, seemed to be awkwardly shoved into the plot. With little to no background given other then that they just happened to be in the right place at the right time with the other characters. The acting was also not that great in some areas either. Especially Dacre Montgomery as the Red ranger. Don't get me wrong, he wasn't a horrible pick for the leading ranger, he just could have done better in some moments. You can definitely pick out the times when the acting was very poor. Another thing to note is that the pacing felt off at times. The first half was set up very nicely, with good introduction to the world we were being introduced too, but what the film does wrong after that is it takes the audience's new knowledge of this world and shoves the climax of the film in our face. One second the protagonists are on their knees clearly defeated with no real answer on how to win, and then, in what feels like less than a minute or two, they're an unstoppable force that no one can defeat. My friends and I were laughing the entire duration of the climax, it was just so ridiculous and off paced we couldn't help it. Overall, not the greatest movie. I could go more in depth about the action and antagonist but that just reaffirms what I already said. I will admit that the film it had its good and funny moments, especially the first half. Go see it if you've got nothing else to do and want to laugh at some corny jokes. Otherwise I'd recommend seeing or doing something else with your free time and wait till it hits redbox.",Power Rangers

456,hlazox,Pays Homage To What Made Power Rangers Fun For Us As Kids,7,27 March 2017,"From a power rangers point of view, I think this movie was a 10 on 10. People who are interested in watching this movie, must go into the cinema with the right expectations.Please don't expect this power rangers movie to be as deep, as a movie like 'the dark knight', 'batman v superman' or 'shawshank redemption'. Historically speaking, power rangers had a corny production vibe to it, especially visually and this is one of the reasons kids fell in love with it. Kids at a young age, aren't as could as they are when they get older at interpreting deep philosophical messages; which is why power rangers in general isn't the type of show/movie you watch, expecting to leave the theater with a huge epiphany about life.I'd class this movie as overall fun and entertaining to watch. What I loved about it is the was never a scene whereby I felt bored. Though let me not exaggerate things and make you feel like every scene has got action in it, which is obviously not true. The point is the movie manages to keep an audience who walks into it with the right expectations, actively engaged in it.The were moral lessons one can learn by watching the movie. Issues like how to work as a team, how to be a leader, human mortality, opening yourself up emotionally to your friends, resisting conforming to societal expectations and having an open mindset.A few downsides to this movie were the graphics kind of looked cheap -- as in the visual effects weren't as real-like, like a movie like star wars the force awakens in my opinion. The villain came off as corny and audiences who like serious movies, probably won't like this movie. Though keep in mind -- the cheap looking graphics, corny villain and sometimes lack of seriousness in this movie is what makes power rangers the franchise it is today.So don't go into the theater expecting a movie with extremely deep philosophical points, that tells us humans are ultimately self-serving individuals etc.",Power Rangers

A lot of people outright hate the movie for not putting in much action but the end fight is worth it.Not spoiling anything but i would like my action scene to be well earned.An area in which this movie doesn't falter.By the end you will know(not only see) these characters and when they are put into zord fights you will care for them.UNLIKE THE TV SHOW.

Overall there were some really cliché lines and some that were even a little cringey.What made the movie good however, is that you can relax, have a good time, and not take it seriously. Have a laugh, enjoy the action.With all the ways this project could have gone wrong, the team behind it did a remarkable job returning with this. So the harsh reviews aren't necessary.

However, the Ranger suits, Zordon and Alpha 5's designs were a bit disappointing, which is why I gave this film a 6. If you do a reboot, at least try to keep the original aesthetics!",Power Rangers
464,besasquotch,Better than I expected,8,13 June 2017,"When I saw the trailers for the movie my initial thoughts were that it was cool they were making a Power Rangers movie but the music was horrible, the CGI was just bad, and the alien power ranger suits that reminded me of Venom from Spider Man 3. This initial reaction kept me away from seeing it in theaters. However now that its available to watch digitally I thought I'd give it a watch and damn was I in for a surprise.So spoiler alert, if you went into this movie wanting non-stop action then you were probably disappointed. This movie follows the formula most first movies in the superhero genre. Unlike the sequels where the heroes have their powers you need to spend time on getting to know the characters, how they get their powers and in this case how they come together to form the bond that leads them to become a true team. After they form the bond and get used to their powers they face the enemy that has been gathering power throughout the film and end up saving the day and proving themselves as heroes to the town. And I liked how they implemented it in this film.The suits ended up not being too bad. They explained the suits well enough and they grew on me after watching the film. The one thing I wasn't a fan of was Goldar...instead of a monkey creature wearing gold armor you literally got walking liquid gold. Ummm...yeah. Granted the monkey wearing the gold suit makes even less sense but I dunno seeing the zords fighting the liquid gold monster just didn't look right. As far as the zords themselves go they were decent enough. The designs were alright. I liked how they interacted with each other and helped each other out but the CGI was almost as bad as the original power rangers movie with the ninja zords. I don't mind CGI when its done right but this missed the mark a little.So overall not a bad movie. Its not going to win an Oscar anytime soon but I definitely can see a sequel happening. I liked the cast and thought most of the actors did a decent job. My gripes are not with the story, which I thought was pretty dang good. I just wish that if the production team was aiming for a more realistic version of power rangers they would have put a little more effort into making the visuals more realistic. Instead you got a serious movie with passable CGI at best. If they were going for a campy movie than we would have been than happy with a man in a mech suit. And stick with more remixes of the power rangers theme next time and drop whatever crap they had playing during the finale.

The one thing I can give to this movie is the CGI. I really like those and they were pretty damn well in my opinion, even though Alpha was... weird and Zordon in the wall, well... I have one of those things decorating my room. And I don't even like it. Plot wasn't there, script wasn't there, music was kinda there, but not really, and acting... Man I'm sad. I have to admit though that the one thing that really pushed me to write this ""bad"" review is the fact that I kept hearing a bunch of teenagers, that happened to be the Power Rangers, say ""kill"" all the time. Really script writer/director? You liked that? Turning heroes into murderers by using only one word? And repeatedly too! What happened to the word ""stop""? Couldn't you just say ""We have to STOP her""? Always kill, kill, KILL! And the ""FINAL BATTLE""? What a letdown. A almost 2-hour movie to see the bad gal get b-slapped into space? OK I have to admit that was pretty funny and the reason I gave this a 3 star instead of 2. The 2nd star was for the CG. Man... Did I say I am sad?",Power Rangers
468,flavio-84398,Just what I was looking for,10,25 March 2018,"I remember watching the trailer for this movie and thinking how cheesy it looked. 5 teenagers with teenager dramas and no real plot. After watching I can say its is exactly that! Let's be honest here, power rangers were a crap series. Yes we all loved it as kids, but it was just a way to sell toys to kids. But this movie takes all those rotten lemons and make a pretty average lemonade. There is a great mix of action and comedy, and even if some parts dragged on, it really get that teenager feeling. The ending is more focused on the action part. I'm sure it would work better if they made the part with the zords shorters because they just didn't have a good enough CGI animation.",Power Rangers
469,Psycher64,Surprisingly Good,7,1 April 2017,"I went into the movie with relatively middling expectations. I mean, it's a Power Rangers movie, and I could only expect so much quality to go into it. However, I came out of the theater very surprised how much I enjoyed it.Each of the five leads really brought their a-game and were believable in their portrayals of each character. Each Ranger even got their own moment of sentimental depth. Also, each Ranger truly is a ""teenager with attitude"", as opposed to the original Mighty Morphin' team. For example, Jason (Dacre Montgomery) was a star football player who played a prank that cost him scholarship offers and also causes him to be placed under house arrest.I was especially surprised (and impressed) with the direction they took Rita Repulsa (Elizabeth Banks). Rather than being the flamboyant, loud-mouthed interpretation that the fans have known her to be, she is portrayed as a power (and gold) hungry psychopath who has genuine shades of horror to her.Zordon (Bryan Cranston) was fleshed out as a lot more than just a giant face on a screen. The film gives him a truly engrossing back story that connects him with Rita.There was even a scene early on that reveals that Billy (RJ Cyler) is autistic, but the film didn't make a huge deal out of it, which, honestly, is the best way to go about it. Things like this aren't supposed to be taken as a huge reveal, as there's a good chance that you know a few autistic people in your life and don't even realize it.They do something similar with Trini (Becky G), except rather reveal her as autistic, she is revealed as gay. The team doesn't make a big deal about it, and accept that she's different. Bravo to the writing team for that.In the end, I was really impressed with Power Rangers. I didn't grow up with the franchise (I saw the original series when I was a young teen), but I'm genuinely excited for the many sequels planned.",Power Rangers
470,raileybetty,Could have been so awesome...,2,14 June 2017,"This could have been an awesome summer blockbuster. It just fails on so many levels. I'm not a 90's kid and I didn't grow up watching power rangers. I went into this movie with an open mind and expecting a sci-fi/fantasy action type of film.. something exciting and fun.. or at least a decent popcorn flick, if nothing else. That's not what I got! It's just plain bad. There were problems all over this movie, but I'll try to address the main issues i had with it:1. Boring - It just felt like it lagged on an on, I kept waiting for the action to begin and it didn't come literally until the last 15 minutes of the movie. It was basically like a teen drama that you'd see on Mtv or the CW... they didn't even turn into power rangers or use any of their robots until the very end. Their megazord reminded me of something off the last Transformers movie.2. Mediocre Production - The little amount of action that finally came was poorly executed (boring action, if you know what I mean) and there was a lot of atrocious looking CGI. Think about the quality of CGI you might see on a TV show, because they don't have the budget of a major film... It's like that, but a little worse. The whole plot is dumb. Then there are plot holes that go unexplained, miracles that inexplicably happen just in time to avert death, and at one point the characters do something incredibly stupid and moronic that would have killed them all, but the scene just suddenly ends and skips to the next day where they are all fine without a scratch, yet offers no explanation as to how this happened...wtf?! However, the worst of it all is the way the actual final battle goes and how they defeat the villain, because it was almost unbelievable. It was like comedy, as if that whole sequence was a prank and Ashton Kutcher was going to come on screen and tell us we were punked. The movie was also a giant advertisement for Krispy Kreme.3. Subpar Acting/Script - the characters are bland and just not good at acting, with maybe the slight exception of the blue and yellow rangers who seemed to actually put forth some effort into their performances. Granted, the script was ridiculous to begin with. Things became predictable, you already knew what they were going to say or do before it happened because we have seen it all before -it was all unoriginal. All the clichés were used in this movie. All the characters had the usual ""life struggles"", though most of those ""struggles"" were so shallow and superficial, that they couldn't be considered struggles to begin with... so feeling any connection to them was impossible. The craziest part is that it appears that this movie was made to be watched by middle school aged children, yet the movie goes out of its way to repeatedly show us how the characters are ultra-cool and unique, and are fearless, unruly rebels who commit crimes and break the law over and over. They cuss throughout, they drink underage, they say lame one liners and try to act so hard. Still, though, they are unimpressive and end up being annoying.. like we get it, you're 16 and you are top dog bad asses in your small town.. now let's move on.The only reason I gave 2 stars instead of 1 is because it's not the WORST movie I've ever seen, but it still sucks pretty bad.",Power Rangers
471,gdelisa,Phenomenal. I want more!,9,5 April 2017,"Growing up and loving the cheesiness of the original series, I went into this film with an open mind. Needless to say, my mind was blown away. It's perfect! And yes, it is an origin story which means that it focuses on the characters and developing their relationships with one another. The morphing sequence towards the end of the movie was a perfect payoff to a wonderfully timed story. I really hope we get to see a sequel, if not several sequels.

Honestly weren't expecting much from the movie but only the first scene was enough to glue us to our seats, ZORDON (Red Ranger) v RITA (Green Ranger), what else do you need!! The 5 actors were phenomenal especially Darce, Becky G, Naomi Scott and RJ Cyler, well RJ Cyler was outstanding. The character development was amazing, which we never got to see in the 1993 series. All the rangers had a strong emotional back story which quickly attaches you to them. The only weak part of the movie was the ending which I think was too rushed but it too had it's charm (the morphing, Zords and the MEGA ZORD). It's a must watch for all the fans and those who aren't fans can also give it a shot. Definitely gonna watch it again and can't wait for the sequel!",Power Rangers
474,zanman-77261,A New-Nostalgia Blast from the Pa....Future,10,28 March 2017,"It's Morphin Time! At least that's the case for superhero movies as this particular flick surpassed every expectation i had (and believe me, they were high.) Not to give away anything about the plot, we get some much desired backstory to the delight of Fans and new comers everywhere.With the new rebooted feel, but keeping true to the classic cheesiness of the 90's this is a combo unlike any other i've seen before. Familiar characters, names, zords and colors bring back a joy (movie wise) in which i haven't experienced since the warehouse scene in Batman vs Superman (BATMAN RULES!!!).Now with the name ""Power Rangers"" you don't expect a whole lot when it comes to characterization, but in a mind blowing fashion this turns out to be one of the best characterized movies in the past few years. They create and bring to life lovable characters, including the most lovable character in recent memory, The Blue Ranger Billy.You may be wondering about the action and believe me, it doesn't disappoint. Hand to hand combat that would make some kung fu movies blush, complete with clashing of Giant mechanical dinos and even some exploding puddies (watch to figure out that word if you don't know what i'm talking about)It is a constant change from slow to fast paced, in a way that is completely tolerable and constantly engages you in ways that keep you captivated by this amazing, yet simple, plot. Not only is it a must see for Power Rangers fans, but Super Hero movie enthusiasts everywhere! It is in my top 3 superhero movies of all time. No joke.I grade this movie an EASY A+, and with my fan boy adrenaline pulsing am tempted to give it an extra ""+"" But one thing is for certain, as soon as this movie comes out, it will takes its place on my shelf along with all of my other favorite movies. You can be assured that if there is a special edition, that i will be purchasing it.Rating: A+",Power Rangers
475,reubenwarnerolson,"A great Power Rangers movie, but maybe not a solid film.",8,24 March 2017,"It's hard to screw up the Power Rangers when the original series embraced its campy origins in Super Sentai. This film takes itself as both a serious reboot with a lot of underlying cheesiness. Some welcome inclusions widen the Power Rangers typical story line of acceptance to relevant themes in our current generation. The first act starts off really strong, seeing a darker-tone set up our cast of heroes. The second act starts to dwindle off and waste time before finally revealing each heroes' backstory and making them bond together. The third act is (unfortunately) rushed but still an entertaining and satisfying final fight. If only the film shortened the second act and lengthened the third would it have solidified its existence as a strong film. Sadly its flaws detract from it becoming a relevant movie in the year 2017, but it will make history with the first gay superhero and the (first?) autistic superhero as well. As a Power Rangers entry though, oh boy, is it exciting. Far better than the other Ranger's entries into film. Sadly, the one crucial element to nostalgia — the theme song — is clipped to FIVE seconds in length. If it had been spread throughout the final fight it could have fully embraced its origins.",Power Rangers

If you are an original fan please DO NOT watch. The film was sexualized and at times a little disturbing. This remake is for a whole new generation. If this is what we are producing for the next generation then this is unsettling. The audience In the movie seemed to enjoy this movie but as an original fan I had to walk out half way. The actors performed more on a chessy, no acting skills level. The villain was a tormented individual with no talent. Zordon was completely different, more of an aggressive angry frustrated personality. That alone made me walk out, original Zordon was patient, wise, and kind. I believe we got 15 minutes of fighting if that in this 2 hour movie. Everything that was once positive about the series, was completely missing in the movie.

491,jpgames-38356,Don't have your hopes too high,7,29 March 2017,"The first installment of the Power Rangers series, was very well done. The movie was mostly back story and character development, which did make some fans upset with the movie, but there are five sequels planned. So have faith.I only noticed a few problems right off the bat, but otherwise the movie was just fine and enjoyable for an entire family to see. It had it's childish aspects, with childish humor at many points, but it also had a dark side to it. It had a deep meaning to many parts, such as Zach's mother being sick which you learn quickly on through the movie. As I stated, there was a lot of childish humor, but even adults can enjoy some of it. Such as one of Jason's friends attempting to milk a male cow, not realizing that it was male. Or the nick name that students gave to Billie when he was a child, I'll let you watch to see that. Even at those points, they're enjoyable for everyone(unless you don't have any sense of humor).This installment was completely opposite of what the T.V. shows and old movies used to be, as it was more realistic, less cheesy, and much more dark.Rita was vicious in this movie as she hunted for gold so she could build Goldar, and there are many jump scares that come with her. There's no doubt in my mind that a child would truly be afraid of her. Even with Rita and all, every character has a deeper side and they can connect quite well. Like in this installment, Billie has a form of autism, and Trini is a lesbian. They explore these, and show how people think of them because of it. There were only a couple of cheesy moments, such as Jason giving the classic line, ""it's morphing time"" but how could he not say it. Then there was the classic song that had to be included, ""Go! Go! Power Rangers!"" It had a beautiful nostalgic feel to it that made every fan of the shows sit up happily. Otherwise there were situations like the Zeo crystal being under Krispy Kreme and the metaphor of it representing life of America, and Rita eating a doughnut while everyone else fights. Even then it made me laugh at the pure silliness of it.The CGI in the movie was absolutely beautiful, with Goldar looking like a monster. Even the Mecca Zord (not a spoiler, look at the trailer) looked amazing. The action scenes were very good, even if there weren't many of them. It was fast paced, but had slow motion moments to show how powerful they were hitting, they added in CGI when Rita hit very hard just to show the true impact. The fight scenes were funny at some points, and very fluent. They were rather easy to keep track of.There were many moments that drew out emotions, such as Rita being good at drawing out fear, and the movie might even make you tear up at some points. It did a very good job at making you connect with the characters and really feel for them.I think that Power Rangers did an amazing job with it's camera angles, and having the idea of ""showing, not telling."" There was lot of exposition as the characters got to know one another, but all the other information was set up in showing us what happens. There weren't too many problems with Power Rangers, but some people didn't like the camera angles they used which I personally enjoyed. It was something new and fresh, and reminded me of someone following them with a camera at some points. The acting was off at some points with a couple lines being delivered weirdly.I don't blame the actors all too much, because I believe they're all relatively new and they're young. Besides a couple lines being off and facial expressions, the acting was done very well for children their age.Some people didn't like the fact that the Ranger suits formed toff so it would show their faces. It did kind of upset me, as we don't get to see much of the suits through the movie, but it helped the audience connect as the suits didn't have moving mouths since they aren't CGI.As i stated earlier, we don't get to see much of the Rangers themselves but that will come soon enough. The action was very good for the time it had, and we should appreciate that.The movie did feel rushed and hard to keep track of at points, such as the beginning when they introduce Jason. It's very fast paced, but after that scene it slowed down and really introduced them. Then the only other scene that was hard to keep track of was when Zordon woke up.I thought that Power Rangers was very good, and was much better than i had excepted because i didn't expect much. So if you're going to go see it, I recommend not getting your hopes up because it's not a block buster. But it's definitely a must see.",Power Rangers
492,asillett-57045,This is not a good movie (SPOILERS),2,29 March 2017,"This movie is boring, poorly written, and stupid. It's not stupid in a fun way, either. I went into this movie with expectations that I would have for a Transformers movie; I hoped for explosions, fun action scenes, and cool CGI. Guess what this movie had? NONE OF THAT. Because it was so boring, I was forced to sit through boring scenes of people talking about boring back stories.This movie suffered from the same problems that Superman v Batman and Suicide Squad suffered from: they tried so hard to fit so much stuff in, that the pacing is terrible and nothing feels like it goes together. The whole movie is very forgettable except one scene... (Spoilers, kinda)The opening scene, when the Red Ranger (who's character name I can't remember and can't be bothered to go back and look) gets into a car chase with the police after pulling a prank at the high school. The cinematography and camera-work is fantastic and really got my hopes very high for the rest of the movie. It's reminiscent of the tank scene from Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. It's a little difficult to pay attention to everything that's going on, but at least it looks cool and keeps you engaged, UNLIKE THE REST OF THE MOVIE. Overall, I would say that no matter what reviews people read, they're going to see it no matter what. Also, (spoilers again) when they finally morph into the animal robots (I never watched the show much, so maybe I just don't get it) they play the original theme song from the show for no reason other than to force nostalgia. At least the original show, from what I did see, was campy and fun. This movie can't decide if it wants to be serious or funny (just like Suicide Squad). Come to think of it, this movie has a lot of similarities to Suicide Squad, except with Suicide Squad, it had more than THREE ACTION SCENES IN THE WHOLE MOVIE. This is a bad movie.

The character's private life outside of school had me filling up a few times, each different and enough to make me sympathise with them and wish they'd become this group of Rangers. It was surprisingly funny, cheesy as well at times but I think it was very much intended. ..Just a tip of the hat to the original TV series.It had it all, I nearly cried, I laughed, it was cheesy when it shouldn't have been which had me linking it back to 'the good ol' days'. Action packed, not enough to bore me like anything Bay related but enough to keep me zoned in. I hope to god this makes enough because I want to see a second, I really do.

I didn't know any of the 5 people they picked to be the rangers, it worried me but they all were SO GOOD! They did all of there characters so much justice. Bryan Cranston and Bill Hader absolutely hit it out of the park with Zordon and Alpha 5. I've heard some people saying they weren't a fan of Elizabeth Banks as Rita Repulsa but I have to whole heartedly disagree, I thought she did a great job of bringing Rita to a modern day film but still giving her that great sense of nostalgia. This movie is a little dark at some points, but it isn't a depressing movie to watch. It has a lot of humor and goofiness that will make you reminiscence of your old days of watching power rangers. This movie was also surprising in the aspect that it has a lot of curve balls and surprises. They would have a lot of parts where they would make you think they were about to have a very cliché movie scene. But then they would completely take you in another direction. There is also a nice little mid credit scene so stay tuned for that. This movie felt a lot like if you take the good things that Marvel does with there movies, and the good thing DC comics does with there movies, and used those aspects to make a power rangers movie, this would be the result. If you were a fan of power rangers, you'll love this. If you weren't, I still think you would have a good time with this movie. My favorite movie of this year or last year!!!",Power Rangers
496,drvyj,"A great deal of depth, very refreshing",10,1 April 2017,"Questions centered on CGI, special effects or the tech used in the film can be quickly answered with 'yes, yes, they are done well,' and 'oh, you will have an enjoyable ride, particularly in the third act, or the final 40 minutes,' and yet, people who go to see Power Rangers again may be doing it for more than just the armor and the zords. For once in a twenty-year-long (and expensive) barrage of costumed-hero trilogies, alliances and big versus-showdowns, we finally have a breather in something that is really quite serious, quite grown-up, and nowhere near childish.Power Rangers points the camera at people, and admittedly, holds it there for a somewhat protracted period of time, but much good comes from it. Before this film, you will never imagine being privileged with the opportunity to actually feel for a Power Ranger character on a deep, existential level. These people begin to matter to you very quickly, and at no time during the movie are you made to feel that their stories are a receding tide written to be gotten over with – obligatory backstories conveniently swept away so that action can commence. Power Rangers has come into a league of its own, and the broad majority of entrants in the superhero genre will struggle to even remotely compare.Comparisons will be made by some with the Warner Bros. picture that emerged several years ago – Pacific Rim – but there are important differences between the two movies. Pacific Rim is a robot movie oriented on giant monsters, with personal stories enmeshed in the script to serve as girding for a loud action movie. What Power Rangers has pulled off – and this is very surprising to say of a Power Rangers movie – is a coming-of-age introspective, almost art-house-y piece of youth literature cataloging the stories of young people who face dark prospects in their own lives, but happen to come across robots and giant monsters. The literary direction of the Power Rangers movie is extraordinary, given how the formulaic comfort of hi-tech action over character development seems to be the go-to for much of the superhero fare churned out in recent years.Watching Pacific Rim, or any Avenger movie, always feels like guilty pleasure, and we always stop short of feeling too much for the characters, because the characters are not well-built anyway and there is always this detachment we sense – this disconnect that these characters carry about themselves that set them apart from reality. Throughout a lot of the modern superhero clash-and-bang we treat ourselves to, we retain a helicopter enjoyment of such characters, watching them move as pawns across the chessboard. The worlds in which they operate are quite independent of our own, even if locations familiar to us are used. This is not to say that there is no merit to such movies. Rather, they make up the bulk of what we have grown used to, and in the void hence, Power Rangers has managed to bring us a new way of stringing together a superhero movie.Power Rangers fills an important gap – the wish for characters that, outside their powers, resonate in empathic symphony with our own challenges, aspirations and fears, and when in their powers, retain a discernible humanity. The individual is not subsumed by the superhero power; the Ranger identity does not take over and does not render the person the mere flesh that lives underneath the garb. Even better, the Ranger power is not even an extension of the individual – as though the young adult him/herself wasn't enough and had to be given upgrades. It feels strange that we now look to a Power Rangers movie to remind ourselves that we do not have to become someone/something else in order to come into our own. To become powerful, we do not need to shed ourselves. Rather, we need to know ourselves, be ourselves and use that to our advantage. And when you rise powerful and confident, your self isn't eradicated. You are not lost. Those Ranger powers come from within these young people, and the gemstones they found were no more than conduits.The sense of ownership of power that this film conveys is radical in the industry of story development today. Power Rangers refrains from aggrandizing the role the machines have, or the fact that there is an otherworldly spacecraft, or the place the suits have in making the young men and women ready for combat. Like we said, the camera's eye stays on these troubled, unique individuals, and they are allowed to define the story and carry it all the way to the finish line. Indeed, the technological implements that occur in the film are treated so matter-of-factly, that they melt into the background of the narrative and become united into the fabric of the story itself: you are being given a chance to break out of debilitating despair – are you going to make good of it?Power Rangers is a movie that lets you keep all of the film and have nothing to be ashamed of. Pick a T-shirt or an artefact attributable to any other superhero/giant robot movie, and you may find yourself wincing at the elements of hilarity that stick around and haunt that T-shirt, weapon or figurine. Power Rangers in its 2017 movie composure is a success for having ripped its way out of this paradigm to transcend it; and now, anything related to this movie comes with a tinge of forlornness borne of real struggles we can identify with. That such maturity arrives in our time on the saddle of a Power Rangers movie is astonishing in itself without thought for what other franchises should have done. And when you do think about the deluge of action vomit that has ruined the dignity of film in the last decade or two, you will find these Power Rangers to be a hearty godsend.",Power Rangers
497,kuno_stars,Developed characters taking on social stigmas while also banishing evil on the side.,8,2 April 2017,"Leadership. Teamwork. Friendship. Good vs evil. Surface level themes. Power Rangers is a movie about being honest with oneself and others, accepting your own flaws, and taking responsibility for your actions. The spectrum. The importance of communication (especially within the family unit). The value of kindness to strangers. The weight of familial responsibility. Gender equality. Selflessness. While the movie does not fully address these issues, it does shed some light on them, and given proper space for open dialogue, you can push those discussions further. Power Rangers shows the audience that it is okay to be human; that it is okay to make mistakes; that atonement is possible, if you learn to not only forgive yourself, but to also believe in who you can become.This movie let's the moment breathe, and allows characters to develop, revealing pieces of themselves to each other and to the audience, so that you, as the viewer, are a part of the bonding process. There is a bit of you in every character: the unfulfilled potential, the regret of an action, the feeling of being misunderstood, the view from the outside looking in, the anger from feeling helpless, the want of something better, the unrelenting goal-oriented fervor, etc. Plus, (minor spoiler) the opening car chase sequence was totes awesome.",Power Rangers

499,saulalfarosc,Power Rangers Movie Review: It's Morphin Time,7,6 April 2017,"Saul Alfaro English 121 Dr. MillsIt's Morphin Time (Power Rangers Movie Review)Without any hope for this movie to be critically successful even for the long time fans, Power Rangers is a pleasant surprise. Before the movie began, I had in mind what the majority of people thought before it was released. This movie was not only suppose to be bad but terrible, but as I like to do with every movie I see, I go in with an open mind regardless of anyone's expectations including my own. I really liked Power Rangers because I thought the movie was very well character driven and not heavily reliant on the Power Rangers brand or name in any way and expecting people to enjoy this movie simply because of that. This is key because all of these characters do not ""morph"" until later in the third act of the movie. The climax of the third act was very powerful because the Power Rangers are finally ready to morph after all of their hard work and training. I am also sure that all of the long time Power Rangers fans also got a little misty eyed when the colorfully yet realistic battle Armour covers up them all up and officially become Power Rangers as Brian Cranston's character Mordon says the iconic words every Power Rangers fan will know ""It's morphin time."" In the third act the Power Rangers gore is felt with the main villain and antagonist Rita striking fear into the new Power Rangers by uttering the words ""I've killed Rangers before!"" The third and final act of the movie truly does feel earned by fleshing out all of the characters and building them up from the start which in my eyes made the movie work in the end. Power Rangers was a pleasant surprise because just like the vast majority of people I expected a bomb but I will give Power Rangers three stars out of five.",Power Rangers

However, I have not seen a movie this bad since the 3rd Spiderman Movie and Avatar The Last Air Bender live action that no one speaks of. Now I can't say its the worst cause I have seen worse, but its not worth the time to even watch it let alone pay to see in any theater. If you want something that is power rangers and okay, watch the original. The only things honestly good about the movie were their progressive inclusion of a LGBT and a young man on the Autistic spectrum. Thing is having these things does not make a movie good and though they are trying to keep their characters and ideas up today with changing culture. The movie concept was outdated to say the least and has been way overdone not just by every single series of the power rangers, but also every hero/action movie made since the 1990s. Stay at home, don't waist your money. Go watch Beauty and the Beast if anything.",Power Rangers
502,robertjeffrey-24307,OK. But cld of been better,5,9 April 2017,As my summary says. It could off been better. I am a big fan off the original power rangers and I so wanted this to be great. Sadly it was just OK. Not enough fighting in this. We all know the original cast were great martial artists. But after watching this film. I can't tell you if any of the cast can do martial arts. Story was OK. Just took ages to get to it. Was not impressed with zordon. Feel the casting was wrong. The one who stood out for me was R J who played the blue ranger. He was great. One last thing I was disappointed with is the fact there's no ... morphine time and the rangers holding the morphers.For the next one of like to see Jason Frank as a ranger.

Producers did the best bringing Power Rangers to big screen again, making the movie more dark, more realistic, more authentic. The direction, set design, photography, the cast and the script are memorable.

Always had been a fan of the original show and this movie perfectly re-introduces the franchise to a new generation. The movie felt like it was aimed towards millennials (since the fans of the original were born when the show debuted). I love how the producers wanted to focus on the characters and human aspect of the Power Rangers. The characters were very well developed and the actors had extreme chemistry with each other. I love movies where the viewers become invested into the characters and the story takes time to tell the stories of the characters. This movie isn't without flaws. It takes the same approach as Edwards did with Godzilla in 2014: the movie is called Power Rangers but said Power Rangers are not in the film for a long time and only appear in the climax. Some of the dialogue is cheesy but what can you expect for a Power Rangers movie! There were a few scenes where ""the feels"" really hit, and if a movie does that, then the movie did its job. I was expecting a Transformers ripoff but this movie is far superior than the Transformers movies (sorry Michael). I recommend this movie to everyone, Power Ranger fan or not!",Power Rangers

I grew up watching Power Rangers (not the original but the following series on nickelodeon) and this movie had everything that made me love the show when I was a kid. But my personal Highlight was the movies diversity of characters (spoiler ahead): Almost all the Teenager had different ethnicities and backgrounds, one of the girls was struggling with her sexuality, one boy was autistic.

The cgi looked great, the story behind each character was quite deep and relatable. Also, there were many clips that explains the story of why the power rangers are formed and why the villain is attacking the city. The movie was not nostalgic BECAUSE it's a reboot, it's meant to create nostalgia for the new generation of fans, not us 90s spandex fanboys.

This movie isn't REALLY good, for sure, but I genuinely had fun watching it. The characters are fun, almost equally developed over the movie, and the fight scenes (at the end, halas) were cool too ! It's a shame there isn't more fights, yeah, but that does NOT justify a 2/10 review if you knew what you were going to watch. If you've watched Power Rangers as a series, and enjoyed it, you will enjoy this movie for what it is ; a really fun adaptation. I hope this gets a sequel. Had a great time.",Power Rangers

Secondly, everyone on screen does a great job with their characters. The kids in the movie are fantastic actors who will have many big projects in the future.There are scenes that are intended for teens rather than kids, but if you can get over that and just enjoy the movie, you will be pleased. They are looking for a 15-35 demographic here.The main issue is that there is a lack of memorable scenes and the movie needed more action spots. Maybe even dug a little deeper into the mythology behind the Power Rangers. Explain why they exist and who the dangerous people in this world is.I believe the studio and producers were thinking that this would be an origin story and there would be many movies. But it did not do that well at the box office. New ideas are needed, maybe even doing a little more over the top stuff from the TV series. Something is missing here, which is why it got a 7 out of 10 for me. There's so many places that future movies can get to, but not sure if we will get sequels.",Power Rangers

515,destinymckenna,Pleasantly Surprised.,8,17 June 2017,"**CAUTION: CONTAINS SOME SPOILERS** The movie definitely surpassed my expectations. When the trailer was first released, I thought about going to see it but was not truly interested. When it was released to the public, I bought it and was surprised to like it as much as I did. Though it won't be up for any awards, it was enjoyable and fun to watch.If you want to see it because you were a fan of the old television show, be prepared for disappointment. This movie was not made to appeal to the previous generations. It has elements of nostalgia, but if you go into it expecting what you watched as a kid, you will not like this movie.KEEP IN MIND PEOPLE that this movie is PG-13, so if you have KIDS, you might want to look out for cussing, sexual innuendos, rebellious behavior, and scenes that IMPLY things of a sexual nature. It's a film about teenagers, so what more could be expected? Tapping into the teenage world, it was refreshing to see teenage drama play out in a way that is true to the real world.And the characters are truly everything people have been asking for and a major step in the right direction for the film industry. You have black, white, Asian, Indian, and Latino characters all sharing lead roles with one being apart of the LGBTQ+ community and another with Autism. And both aren't shoved into the background at any point. There is even dialogue in the movie referencing their different colored Power Ranger suits and their different ethnicities: ""Five kids, five colors, five different colored kids!""Problems I had with the film include CGI not being the best at times and the characters taking quite a while to mesh together and become a team. You also don't get to see them in their armor until the ending of the movie, which I can understand they tried to build up for suspense but didn't work the way the crew wanted it to. The movie wasn't as action packed as you expect a superhero movie to be. While I liked the fact they incorporated the ranger colors into the costume design, it seemed to me like they tried to overcompensate for the bland armor of the TV show by creating something shiny and new, but that just fell flat in my opinion. They just looked awkward to me in the scenes where they finally had morphed. WOULD RECOMMEND.Despite some points, this movie is overall a great watch. The ending does hold a cliffhanger with the role of the green ranger in the next film, but with how this film did in theaters, I would say do not watch after the credits unless you want to be taunted with the idea of a movie that may not be created.

However, as a kid who grew up in that exact time it was fantastic. And to see a series such as Power Rangers being revisited and updated to the current time it makes sense for it to be a bit darker, grittier and happily with a much larger budget and special effects team. To understand the movie you would at least have to be familiar with the original series to a sampling extent.

I wish there was another hour to allow more backstory but in the end their teenagers. How many teens do you know that have a life story that's super interesting?

All of these shows have that cheesy feel to it but it's what made us all love it and still do. You all are just hating so bad on this movie because these kids don't fit your expectations of what a power ranger should be from the beginning. The directors are trying to tell a different story, yes in the beginning these kids did some bad things & made bad choices. But they start to realize what it is become a true power ranger. Who go from selfish teenage misfits to teenage kids who care about the world and saving their home and the planet. And the sexuality you all are crying about don't remember the original movie where Kimberly practically threw herself at Jason every chance she got & then there was Dulcea who was an almost half naked woman. Yet I see no one pointy that out. Oh that's right its because this is 2017 & a little sexual jokes is like someone just walked around fully naked down the road.

526,jhaddan,Good Job on Reboot! Watch it.,9,20 July 2017,"Warning: Spoilers! First off, I can remember when the very first episode of Power Rangers came on. I grew up with the original and following versions of Power Rangers. I loved it as did most kids I grew up with. I'll be honest; I did not want to watch the movie. Or maybe I'd watch it once it casually came out on Netflix or Hulu. However, my younger brother talked me into watching it and I wasn't disappointed. It felt like the original Power Rangers movie but they said, let's take out all the child like moments and reinsert young adult moments/reactions into, which made sense to me. After all, the power rangers where in high school. Is it a safe clean kid's movie? No, it isn't. But it made it better. Changes to the Franchise.I was on the fence about Alpha-5. He looked awkward to me. The voice didn't work for me either. I guess I was still expecting to see and hear the original Alpha-5. They could have at least left him the same. However, Zordon and Rita, being former rangers, was great. I don't remember any backstory, for them in the original show. Both were more relatable. Even though the original Rita was iconic, with her annoying voice and elaborate costume, the new Rita nailed it. Elizabeth Banks version was fantastic; completely unrecognizable. For once, it seemed Rita was in control and a total bad a**. Zordon to me, took a little time to warm up to. I did. I love how they explained why he is stuck inside the crystals and how he didn't have total faith in the new team. The rangers also had their backstory told which I thought was great. I didn't realize that until this movie; we really had not been told their story. The costumes in all the promotional material looked like crap. They honestly reminded me of the CGI effects from the original Power Rangers movie. Way too shiny! However, in the movie, they looked great. No complaints. The Zords felt like the old Zords. Still great! Overall, I think this reboot did a great job! They even snuck in the original Power Ranges theme song, lightning bolt and even set up Rita to live in outer space in the next movie; which I hope they make! Now, how anyone can give this movie one or two stars, I'm not sure. Unless they were paid to do so. I'll give this nine stars because they kept intact the original, iconic material, while making it more grown up which is essentially all any Power Ranger fan wanted. Just take the cheesy-ness out of SABANS Power Rangers and make it more real. Watch it and enjoy the movie for what it is.",Power Rangers
527,whitegoodman-15872,Boring movie.,1,4 August 2017,"This movie was garbage. It was boring from start to end. It just kept dragging on and on and on and finally morphine time and it was also a huge let down. What was it 2 hour movie? And small BORING battle at the end. I mean this movie had no fire, no energy, no nothing. BORING! I liked the Power Rangers series as a kid, but this was nothing compared to that. Suits were pretty cool and droids, but you hardly even see them. HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!!!",Power Rangers
528,micamecham,"I mean, come on, it is Power Rangers.",8,12 August 2017,"I thought it was pretty good. Let's be real, Power Rangers was impossibly cheesy and hard to watch in its original form. So you can't expect this to be Oscar worthy. I liked the background. Loved the Billy character and inclusion of someone on the spectrum. I thought Elizabeth Banks, who I LOVE, wasn't as awesome in this as she was in say her Effie Trinket performance, but she was no more cheesy than the original character in this role from the original movies. I do think it took a little long to get to the actual morphing suit wearing part. Additionally, I think for a kid movie, it could have done without the cursing. You have to know kids are going to watch it. Other than that, it was entertaining enough to watch with family on a Saturday night. My kids liked it. Overall, it was entertaining in a ""hey let's watch a movie that is light in thought and entertaining in a predictable but still pretty good for a laid back night"" kind of way.",Power Rangers
529,arisbalu,I cant believe i cry while watching a power ranger movie,10,27 August 2017,I have a really low expectation when I came to watch this movie.. I thought it was going to be awful but it's actually pretty good.the characters back story was so much worth exploring in a sequel. the acting was pretty solid. it may not have a good action sequence but the story was pretty much spot on. and that one part when one of the Rangers died was pretty well done. I am a grown man but the atmosphere of that one scene really make me cry. this movie is worth your time and definitely worth your money.,Power Rangers
530,anarabanimelover,What is up with the low rating?,10,26 April 2018,"I went to see this movie on my 16th birthday, and, unfortunately, movie going isn't exactly an easy thing to obtain where I am from. My brother, who doesn't like movies, went with me only because this was Power Rangers, a franchise we both love. I get it, the Krispy Kreme thing is ridiculous, but both of kept laughing the entire way through. We both loved this movie, definitely my favorite movie of the year behind Spider-man Homecoming. It deserves something like a 7 or so.",Power Rangers

And i hope to the good of all mankind they make sequel's( more than 1)... I like the old, love the new even more!!! Dumb ass negative people's",Power Rangers
532,mrsfontenot,Do not let your children watch this,1,22 November 2017,"First off, I consider myself a pretty easy going young parent. I'm 27 and while I try to keep my child innocent I'm far from living under a rock. OK so, my son recently turned 6 and has taken an interest in the power rangers. I was so excited to share something from my childhood and had high hopes for this movie. Unfortunately, this movie is absolute garbage. It's clear that Hollywood is trying to poison the minds of our children (surprise surprise, with all their vile pedophilia coming to the forefront). The first scene was literally a joke about jerking off a bull. It added nothing to the movie, tied into nothing else in the movie, but they just had to include that perverted joke. There were many sexual references through the movie, foul language, and the characters were horrible role models. Nothing like the power rangers when I was a kid. If that wasn't bad enough the movie is SO BORING! It dragged on for nearly 2 hours then ended with a weak fighting scene. Luckily my son lost interest within the first 15 minutes so he didn't catch all the filth in this movie.Save your self money and 2 hours of your life that you can never get back and avoid this lousy movie.",Power Rangers
533,jonwycoco,"Not bad, but not great.",6,14 December 2017,"Acting is a little overdone, but then again so was the original. As a person who grew up with the show when it first aired, this rendition is meant to be another genesis story. Provide a little more background and bring it up to today's technological specs. While I think it tried too hard and perhaps did try to take itself a bit too seriously, if you come in with an open mind about it, you'll be somewhat surprised and may find that you enjoy it. I found that the camera angles and cinematography was okay, but it had moments where it felt very cheesy. If they could have picked up a really good director for action / sci-first (eg Whedon), we could have had a really excellent and fun movie. Alas, it falls slightly short of good. If you're looking for a bit of a campy movie with some good cheese factor, check it out. Otherwise, perhaps pass this one up.",Power Rangers
534,graphicsamdalton,"Much better than I anticipated, worth a watch, don't expect to be blown away.",7,5 January 2018,"While stumbling through Netflix I saw this film advertised and was surprised to see a new full feature Power Ranger film had been released. I decided to give it a go and was honestly very pleasantly surprised.Power Rangers was never my favorite show as a child. I was always more into Transformers and Dragonball Z; they were always darker, the fight scenes 
were more intense and less ridiculous than a group of teenagers in silly looking colored coded suits; like a selection of angry crayons fighting against disabled monsters. Being born in 1990, alot of my friends would watch it when I went to their house though so I still feel like it's not only part of my childhood but also something I remember fondly on the whole (although I definitely don't have the same level of fandom some people writing reviews here seem too). The action is good, the Zoids are pretty amazing and I have to agree with another reviewer I actually preferred them to the Micheal Bay Transformers. They are clean and simple, not overly complicated and difficult to distinguish making the fight scenes in them clearer and easier to watch. The Megazoid transformation is great and I thought the level of CGI was quite impressive throughout but not mind blowing. But what made the film great to me was the general moral code of the Power Rangers. It was just... nice. Perhaps this narrative is slightly cliche now, it's a fairly standard action film but I felt it sincere. Troubled kids meet each other by chance/fate/destiny and would sincerely die for each other only after a few days of knowing one another. They love each other and want to do right by each other as friends and as people. They genuinely do not hesitate* to take up the mantle as save others lives like heroes. I think that is admirable, and a great role model for children to look up. The Rangers are also quite identifiable as people, with real teenage troubles that cover a wide spectrum that kids and teens will relate too. The whole lesbian thing with Trini (Yellow Ranger) was very briefly delved into and although Billy (Blue ranger) didn't feel autistic if I'm honest he was still one of the best characters, outside of Alpha.I would give this movie a shot. Try not to be crazy disappointing when you realise this is not a nostalgia trip but more of a reboot and re imagining. There is one nice scene with the power rangers theme that made me smile but outside of that, I don't think you'll get a warm fuzzy buzz from remembering and comparing it to the original Power Rangers. Which is a good thing because the original Power Rangers is terrible and a cheese fest. Enjoy it for what it is; a pretty good action movie for teens, with a feel good message about teamwork, friendship, self-love, personal healing and the power of cooperation.
* Well slightly at first, but they have alot to digest and I'm unsure if I would trust a giant talking head and a strange but very good humored robot. Why they know English is beyond me. But they build robot dinosaurs so maybe instantly picking a language and knowing the personal details of peoples lives is childsplay.",Power Rangers

Mighty Morphin Power Rangers is okay.I can tell everyone 3 THINGS. 1.) The Power Rangers always win the wars and battles. 2.) The Megazords look like they are toys and the background are so dumb. 3.) They say things when they want to do a move (watch Sumrai, Ninja Steel, and Dino Charge if you want to see).Never watch Power Rangers. Watch Avengers or Marvel movies.This movie sucks.",Power Rangers

540,katiehobbs,Power Rangers for adults,10,10 November 2018,"I grew up watching Power Rangers as a little girl and loved it. I am now 18 years old. And the Power Rangers have taken a more mature, modern and darker tone. Which is great. The target audience for this film is the kids who watched it when they were younger, who are now ADULTS. It is literally targeted to all of us who are between 16-21 years old. To make it more appealing they had to make it more mature. I also thought the cast was great and I loved the diversity of the rangers themselves. Plus there was a great cameo. I really hope they decide to make a second one as the talent from every actor in this movie was superb. Overall, I thought it was a brilliant remake of Power Rangers. And I also dont feel bad for watching ""a kid's movie"" bc its truly targeted for the kids who watched it when they were little. The new generation of Rangers are way more badass than the original and everything is insanely realistic. Great film. 10 out of 10 would recommend.",Power Rangers
541,jordan_g,Epic,10,16 November 2018,"First scene is epic. Its just epic onwards. They took the formula and made it. Actually made a proper film with the exact formula that lots of us watched as kids, this is far greater than any of the other power ranger movies, it has great cast, feel good quality, amazing effects. The only way this would get a bad review is if you dont know the source material and you expected this to be a modern scifi war film. Its not and its epic. All the characters are great, somewhat more modern, they love each other and I love them. Cant wait for the next one. Im going to tell everyone to watch this. It is absolutely great. Aye aye aye Zordon!",Power Rangers
