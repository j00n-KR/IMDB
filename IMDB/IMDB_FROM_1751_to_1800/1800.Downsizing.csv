0,TheLittleSongbird,Sizeable potential downsized too early,5,17 February 2018,"There was a lot that drew me in to seeing 'Downsizing' in the first place. The trailer looked good, the concept was one of the most fascinating and ambitious ones of the years and for any film seen in a while, there are some truly talented actors on board and really like Alexander Payne's previous work (especially 'Sideways').'Downsizing' is far from being one of the year's worst, in a year with a fair share of bad films. Certainly didn't think it was that bad. At the same time, a huge part of me was expecting so much more. It looked so good and the potential was enormous, but it is one of the year's most disappointing (one of those films that should have worked) and one of the biggest wastes of potential in recent memory. As far as Alexander Payne's films go, 'Downsizing' may be his most ambitious and conceptually original film but it's also his worst by quite some way.It's not all bad. The film looks great throughout, being both stylish and audacious. The first half is very promising and well done with some fascinating ideas. There is Payne's trademark wit and warmth evident, and there is some nice insight and satirising and human relationships and real world issues. Matt Damon carries the lead role well, not one of his best performances but he is well suited to the material and engages nicely with it.Christoph Waltz (in a departure role) and especially Hong Chau bring fun and energy to the pretty much only colourful roles of the film, sadly that is saying a lot. It is a shame that 'Downsizing' didn't live up to the trailer. As good as the trailer was on its own it was also very misleading, and made the film much more interesting, bold and original than it actually turned out to be. The first half was promising and good, the second half takes a complete 180 with a jarring change of tone that abandons the concept and completely forgets what was set up before. Wit is replaced by clumsiness and a preachy tone and warmth is replaced with a clinical coldness and dumbing down. It no longer becomes insightful or fun to watch, and the talking down to the audience feels completely misplaced and leaves a bad taste in the mouth. The more melancholic edge in other places is cloying and doesn't connect emotionally. The story badly meanders, both in increasingly sluggish pacing and coherence where things get confusing and increasingly nonsensical.Of the supporting characters, only those of Waltz and Chau are memorable or used well. The others have far too little screen time in sketchily developed roles, Kristin Wigg, Jason Sudeikis and Udo Kier were on paper perfect for this film and should have worked here but their talents are completely wasted as characters either underwritten and underused (Wiig and Sudeikis) or just off kilter strange (Kier). Payne's direction is uneven, the first half is distinctive Payne while the second half could have easily been mistaken for any other director. To conclude, not awful but a big disappointment. Potential was enormous, the execution downsizes even more than its shrunken characters far too early. 5/10 Bethany Cox",Downsizing
1,SnoopyStyle,bloated downsizing,6,21 July 2018,"Norwegian scientist Dr. Jørgen Asbjørnsen invents miniaturization of human beings, shrinking people down to five inches. It is sold as environmental altruism and a way to live big on a budget. Married couple Paul (Matt Damon) and Audrey Safranek (Kristen Wiig) decides to do the downsizing but at the last minute, Audrey backs out and the couple eventually divorce. Paul is bitter and alone. He befriends his noisy neighbor Euro-playboy Dusan Mirkovic (Christoph Waltz) and Dusan's maid Ngoc Lan Tran, famed Vietnamese activist who was forcibly downsized.Ngoc Lan Tran says something compelling about facing death in the ending. That's the big point of the movie. Director Alexander Payne certainly takes his sweet time. There's no reason for this movie to be more than two hours. The point can be streamlined without Audrey. The first half is really bloated. Matt Damon's everyman does not help. His lack of drive infects the movie. He makes the first half aimless. It should have been a fifteen minute introduction and then get to Dusan and Tran quickly. She's a breath of fresh air and actually gets a few laughs. The Norway part is lacking something and the ending premise is also lacking. I would rather they do something with the slums outside the dome for the ending. There is already some rooting interest built up with the inhabitants of the slums. Going to Norway is a distracting side trip. There is a lot of world building that I question in this movie. There is a compelling movie inside this bloated film somewhere and I enjoyed that movie.",Downsizing
2,Horst_In_Translation,It definitely had its moments,6,18 January 2018,"""Downsizing"" is a new movie released here in Germany recently and after accidentally missing out on Matt Damon's other new release ""Suburbicon"" recently, I had to make sure the same won't happen to this one. It is the newest work by 2-time Oscar-winning filmmaker Alexander Payne who directed this one and also came up with the script together with his longtime partner Jim Taylor. The result is this pretty long 135-minute movie we got here that features the aforementioned Damon in every scene and he gets support by Christoph Waltz, Hong Chau, Kristen Wiig and a few others. Cameos include Jason Sudeikis, Neil Patrick Harris, Margo Martindale and Laura Dern. Payne worked with Dern's father Bruce on Nebraska not too long ago, but we talked about that one on another occasion. Now as for this one here, it is clearly more about the script and story all in all, not an actors movie and still Hong Chau seems in a solid position to sneak in at the Oscars as she did at the Globes and SAG Awards. A win seems highly unlikely though. I personally am not sure I'd nominate her. Unlike Waltz for example, she also has dramatically relevant material that could path her the way.As for the film itself, I enjoyed it and it basically never dragged, which is of course a huge success given the running time. It was at its very best the moment it enters the small world as we experience it, but also experience the protagonist's personal moments like his pain connected to Wiig's character's last words. There was foreshadowing we won't see her again as we see Damon's character move away from her for sure, even if I somewhat expected differently. It was probably necessary to move the story into the direction they wanted to eventually to have her out of the picture. The moments of greatness, like the rose, the butterflies near the end and some others were not frequent enough though for me to give the film an enthusiastic recommendation. Waltz makes the most of his character and provides some really nice comic relief at times that takes a bit away from the more serious, environmental messages. This film is perfect to discuss how far you would have joined the protagonist yourself and I think most would have made the same decision like Wiig's character. It is also interesting how the Norwegians are seen as a revelation early on, but just as some deluded cult in the later stages. Another thing I liked is that it is everybody's financial decision to go small and even if the decision is promoted from the environmental perspective, this is really just a side effect of it all. Aside from that, I liked the visual effects part when big meets small on several occasions. They did as good there as I'd expect from a big Hollywood movie. And yeah, if you are a Damon fan, you need to see it in any case. I know I am. Still, I must admit that this one is inferior to some other stuff by Payne, especially his recent works Nebraska and The Descendants and maybe also to Election for example. But that's just because some of these were really great and this one is just good. It is also debatable if it was a good decision to take the film into the exact final direction they did back in Norway with the new idea of living under the earth. Personal approach will decide how you think about it and if it could have been better to end the film earlier or differently. But I have no doubts when it comes to my recommendation for this one. It's a positive one easily and there wasn't a second of hesitation here for me while watching this one where I would consider giving it something other than a thumbs-up. You really wanna check this one out. One of the better 2017 films and maybe one of the best at over 130 minutes. Recommended.",Downsizing
3,Prismark10,The incredible shrinking man,6,17 January 2019,"Downsizing is a satirical movie about consumerism, the underclass, looking out for one another, ecological disaster and even cults.After a Norwegian scientist Dr Jorgen Asbjornsen invents a process to shrink humans down to five inches. People take up the idea this radical idea. It is good for the environment, little people and little animals need less resources and they create less waste.It is good for the environment. More importantly your $ goes a long long way in a miniaturised society.Once downsizing has become more popular after a number of years. Paul Safranek (Matt Damon) and his wife Audrey (Kristen Wiig) decide to go for it like a few of their friends.They figure that once they sell their house and with their savings, they could live a very comfortable life in a palatial home at a small society. After the procedure, Paul finds out that his wife backed out at the last minute. Alone his life goes through a downward spiral in this new environment.However once he makes friends with party loving neighbour Dusan (Christoph Waltz) his sailor pal Konrad (Udo Kier) he looks at life differently. Especially when he comes across their maid Ngoc Lan Tran, a Vietnamese activist who was forcibly shrunk, injured her leg and who lives in a shanty town. Even in this new society there are the have nots.Director Alexander Payne took a creative risk with Downsizing. It is less about living in a minituasied society more about the new hidden problems. People who are the underclass. Those that were downsized involuntarily or where the procedure went wrong or just [people who run out of money in their new utopia.Paul's life does no go according to plan and it takes a left turn thanks to Dusan and then Ngoc. Dusan and Konrad are wise charming spivs who have spotted an opportunity to make money. Waltz and Kier are like a veteran comedy duo.Ultimately it becomes a story of a growing bond between Paul and Ngoc. She is a busy bee, working, finding food for her little community and helping out people in pain. She is practical and unsentimental.The trouble with Downsizing is that it is too long and the first half of the movie should had been cut down to size.",Downsizing
4,nogodnomasters,Don't get short with me.,3,7 January 2018,"Paul Safranek (Matt Damon) and wife (Kristen Wiig) opt to shrink themselves in order to live the lives of millionaires. Norway came up with the technique as a way to save the planet by reducing our use of resources. Paul's wife backs out at the last minute, leaving Paul to live the small life. The film reminded me of a Steve martin bit, ""Let's get small."" It is supposed to be a satire or statement on materialism and maybe saving the planet, but all I got out of it was the seven forms of sex from a badly stereotyped Vietnamese woman (Hong Chau). I thought her portrayal was pathetic and in bad taste. The statement wasn't succinct. The film bounced between a serious drama and a comedy with poor timing. Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.",Downsizing
5,kosmasp,Problem(s) ... solved(?),6,17 October 2020,"The movie really means well ... and I know just saying that will make some peoples eyes roll. I don't mean any offense by that, it is just that the movie seems so aimless while trying to hit so many things ... talk about so many issues. Be it in our society, enviroment, relationships and love lifes in general.There are quite a few nice set pieces and the actors are amazing overall. But just as surprising (at least for me) the departure of one main character early on was (without a comeback, which I somewhat expected to happen), as surprising but without the impact they could have are the story developments. Everything flows in a weird way and rhythm ... tone wise and otherwise it is all over the place ... for better or worse. You can make of that whatever you want ... and maybe you will get a clear message out of this or maybe you won't ... the latter is more likely unfortunately. Because production values and everything are really good ... and the idea is quite funny - as it is problematic (which also gets mentioned in the movie) ...",Downsizing
6,lee_eisenberg,some problems don't go away,9,3 December 2018,"One of the many environment-themed movies, Alexander Payne's ""Downsizing"" depicts a process by which humans can shrink to an ecologically sustainable size. After one man in particular does so, he learns that the smaller world actually isn't much different from the big one in terms of class structure.Part satire on society in general, part warning about ecological collapse, the movie is a good one. The people who didn't like it must've been expecting something completely else, because I got a pleasant surprise from it. I recommend it.",Downsizing
7,jboothmillard,Downsizing,4,4 February 2018,"I really enjoy movies that mix the big world with the small world, e.g. Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, The Borrowers, the trailer for this new one looked good, so I went to see it in the cinema and hoped for the best, directed by Alexander Payne (Election, Sideways, The Descendants, Nebraska). Basically in the near future, at a research facility in Bergen, Norway, Dr. Jorgen Asbjornsen (Rolf Lassgård) using lab mice is carrying out experiments, and rushes to his colleague Dr. Andreas Jacobsen (Søren Pilmark) when he makes a breakthrough. Five years later, Andreas speaks before a group of people about the dangers of overpopulation, including waste disposal, thus they reveal the drastic solution, called ""downsizing"", a non-reversible process that shrinks a person down to a height of five inches. It is revealed that Jorgen has been shrunk down, one trash bag brought out contains four years' worth of wastage, the doctors then bring out a community of 36 volunteers who have gone through the process, including Little Robbie, the first ever child born small. People around the world watch this amazing scientific discovery, including Paul Safranek (Matt Damon) in Omaha, he looks after his mother (Jayne Houdyshell) who suffers from fibromyalgia. Ten years later, people all over the world have already gone through the downsizing process and are now small, meanwhile Paul's mother has passed away, he is now married to Audrey (Kristen Wiig). At a high school reunion, Paul's friend Dave Johnson (Jason Sudeikis) and his wife Carol (Maribeth Monroe) have been downsized, Dave boasts the benefits of how great things are living in the small community called Leisureland, which offers a life of luxury that would not possible in the big world. Paul and Audrey express their interest in downsizing, they are surprised by the benefits, including the increase in the value of their money, they agree to go through the process. Paul is seen going through the stages before being downsized, including having all body hair shaved off, being heavily sedated, and having his teeth removed, he then wakes up in the small world, a nurse presents him with a huge cracker pack. However, Paul is horrified to find out that Audrey has not been downsized, she is at the airport and got cold feet during the shaving process, claiming she wasn't ready to leave her family, friends and old life behind. Paul is taken to his new home in Leisureland, a large mansion with many luxuries, including a big TV and a pool, but he is depressed over being left alone, and this is only increased by the arrival of his now giant wedding rings. One year later, Paul is finalising his divorce from Audrey, he now works as a telemarketer, Dave tries to console Paul as he regrets his decision to become small, he now lives in a smaller apartment building, below noisy neighbour Dusan Mirkovic (Christoph Waltz). After an unsuccessful date with single mother Kristen (Kerri Kenney), Paul joins the party upstairs, he enjoys the atmosphere, and someone slips him a drug, whilst there he is stars truck meeting the now grown-up Little Ronni (Cameron Geddes). Paul wakes up is Dusan's apartment, just as the cleaning crew arrive, he recognises one of the cleaners, Ngoc Lan Tran (Golden Globe nominated Hong Chau), a Vietnamese activist involuntarily shrunk and smuggled to the United States, she now has a prosthetic leg. Paul tells Ngoc Lan he used to work as an occupational therapist in the big world, she brings him to the slums of the small city, there lives a community of poverty-stricken people, including cancer suffering Gladys (Rose Bianco) who lost her husband during the downsizing process. Paul accidentally breaks Ngoc Lan's prosthetic leg, so helps her in her work to make up for it, cleaning Dusan's apartment, he offers them the chance to get away, joining him and his friend Joris Konrad (Udo Kier) travelling to Norway, where the first small community was created. Ngoc Lan is allowed to come, despite Dusan saying she can't, on the journey, Paul and Ngoc Lan give into their mutual attraction and make love, they reach the community, and Paul is again star-stricken meeting Jorgen. It is revealed however that the constant production of methane emissions in the world mean that humanity is now on the verge of extinction. A vault leading to a colony below ground has been established, this will preserve humanity for the foreseeable future, until things settle, Jorgen and the community see this as the only means of survival and plan to go. Paul is eager to go into the vault, but Ngoc Lan doesn't want to go, the community watch the sunset for the last time before heading down the long tunnel into the colony, Paul says goodbye to Ngoc Lan, Dusan, and Joris, but heading down the tunnel, he changes his mind before the vault door is sealed, in the end Paul returns with Ngoc Lan to Leisureland to help in her work throughout the slums. Also starring Ingjerd Egeberg as Anne-Helene Asbjørnsen, Dawson's Creek star James Van Der Beek as Anesthesiologist, Neil Patrick Harris as Jeff Lonowski and Laura Dern as Laura Lonowski. Damon is reasonable, Waltz is maybe a questionable choice, and I suppose Chau is good. The initial setup is really clever, the mix of the big world and the small world, it is not long after Damon enters the small world that the premise is almost completely ditched, it instead turns into a preachy melancholy affair. Uninteresting global and poverty issues are explored, you almost forget that the characters are small at all, and it goes from funny and smart to almost depressing, it is so disappointing to see a movie like this go the wrong direction in its format, only the first half is worth bothering with, the overall result is unfortunately an unsatisfying science-fiction comedy drama. Okay!",Downsizing
8,zardoz-13,A Small Movie With BIG Ideas!!!,8,9 January 2018,"The best thing about director Alexander Payne's science-fiction, social satire ""Downsizing"" is Matt Damon. Damon makes such a friendly, sympathetic, but average protagonist that you're willing to identify with his plight and amused at the bizarre twists and turns his life takes in this unique comedy about human miniaturization. This isn't the first time that Payne and scenarist Jim Taylor have collaborated on a film. Earlier, they co-wrote four of Payne's films, beginning with the controversial abortion satire ""Citizen Ruth"" (1996), Reese Witherspoon's high school comedy ""Election"" (1999), the Jack Nicholson character study ""About Schmidt"" (2002), and the Paul Giamatti & Thomas Haden Church wine-drinking hysterics in ""Sideways"" (2o04). Payne and Taylor tread a thin line between comedy and tragedy so neither approach overshadows the other. For example, they presented both sides of the abortion argument in ""Citizen Ruth"" and still wallowed in comedy galore with a hopelessly irresponsible heroine who sought to exploit both sides with little success. Basically, their satiric approach softens the sting in their often politically-astute, anti-capitalist rants. ""Downsizing"" adheres to this formula. However, Payne and Taylor have done something far more ambitious and speculative than ever before that may prompt you not only to think, but also laugh when you least expect either in this 135-minute, R-rated epic. Ostensibly, the first hour of ""Downsizing"" delivers knee-slapping hilarity that never degenerates into a stupid lowest common-denominator comedy of errors. Payne and Taylor engross us with the eccentric procedures that our protagonist must face to be shrunk, so he can realize his new dream, brought on by the anxiety that our consumer-based society has induced. At this midpoint, ""Downsizing"" shifts gears from our hero's plight to the plight of an unfortunate heroine, whose own struggles enable our hero to put his own woes into greater perspective. Essentially, ""Downsizing"" qualifies as an art film that doesn't pander. You know when you're watching an art film because you cannot as easily anticipate where the filmmakers are going. ""Downsizing"" complicates matters, and these complications makes its unusual shenanigans about shrinking people to the size of toy soldiers seems even more striking. ""Downsizing"" opens with Norwegian scientist, Dr. Jorgen AsbJornsen (Rolf Lassgård of ""House of Fools""), discovering he can shrink people with a laboratory procedure that has few side effects. Ultimately, Dr. AsbJornsen has a greater agenda than just making people smaller. His quest is the save the planet by reducing the toll that humans exact on our ecological resources as well as the pollution that mankind has made. Earlier Payne movies dealt strictly with characters, while ""Downsizing"" deals not only with characters, but also the greater scheme of things, primarily the environment. AsbJornsen believes an apocalypse is inevitable, and this dread fueled his research. Ten years later, after he astonishes his fellow scientists with his revelations, the rest of the world climbs onto the bandwagon. Now, people are embracing downsizing. However, they aren't doing so for the sake of the world, but for the sake of their wallets. They're discovering that they can enhance their wealth by decreasing their physical size. Communities spring up to accommodate these finger-sized humans. Now, lower income families can afford many of the advantages previously reserved only for the affluent. 
At a high school reunion, an Omaha, Nebraska, couple Paul (Matt Damon of ""The Bourne Identity"") and Audrey Safranek (Kristen Wiig of ""Bridesmaids"") meet classmate Dave Johnson (Jason Sudeikis of ""Horrible Bosses 2""), and he convinces them that small is smart. Paul and Audrey learn they can turn their $156-thousand savings into $12 million and live like royalty. They head off to Leisureland to have themselves minimized and embark on a new adventure. Unfortunately, Audrey gets cold feet about the procedure. Each downsizing candidate must have their bodies scraped clean of hair and undergo a dental procedure. Once they have completed the shrinkage, they can grow their hair back, and dentists can restore their teeth. Audrey backs out after they have shaved her head and one eyebrow. Imagine Paul's hysteria when he awakens on the other side to the news that she has abandoned him. Inevitably, a divorce ensues, and Paul winds up in a luxurious apartment complex rather than the sprawling mansion. An occupational therapist before he downsized, Paul toils as a telemarketer to supplement his divorce settlement. Things take an odd turn when he contends with an obnoxious neighbor, Dusan Mirkovic (Christoph Waltz of ""Django Unchained""), who loves to party. Although he lives in Leisureland, Dusan has normal sized friends on the outside, and he runs a bootleg business in anything he can resell to his own mini-mob. Initially, the two aren't amiable. Paul abhors Dusan's rowdy parties. Eventually, after Dusan and he become friends, Paul meets a Vietnamese protester, Ngoc Lan Tran (Hong Chau of ""Inherent Vice""), who was imprisoned and then reduced for her anarchic activities. She escaped Vietnam in a television box. Now, she runs a cleaning business in Leisureland. She has organized the less fortunate, third-world residents, and she accepts food and medical contributions from the elite to help the downtrodden. Paul tries to fix her prosthetic foot, but breaks it. As a result, he winds up serving in one of her cleaning crews. Incredibly, this Vietnamese anarchist with her charitable attitude wins Paul's heart, and he finds new meaning in life after his series of setbacks. 
 
Payne and Taylor prefer smirks to belly laughs. They maintain subtlety throughout it. For example, after the inductees have been reduced, attendants scoop them up off their gurneys with spatulas as if they were baked goods. When Dr. AsbJornsen presents his initial findings, he speaks into a lavalier microphone clipped onto a miniature podium. One of Dusan's friends, Konrad (Ud0 Kier) jokes that FedEx can deliver his yacht faster to the coast than he can get there. The ironic thing about Paul's troubles is that they get bigger as he gets smaller. ""Downsizing"" is a small movie bursting with big ideas.",Downsizing
9,grantss,"Great, novel set-up but remainder is incredibly dull and disappointing",4,23 February 2019,"Scientists have discovered a way to miniaturise life, including humans. This is seen as a solution to overpopulation and people start to voluntarily be 'downsized', forming communities of downsized people. Paul and Audrey Safranek, an average suburban couple, decide to take the plunge.Incredibly disappointing. This not due to being sucked in by the trailer and then getting something different. On the contrary: the trailer made this movie out to be a silly hijinks-filled comedy, so I immediately disregarded the movie. It was only when I discovered that the movie was written and directed by Alexander Payne, who gave us such superb offerings as Sideways, Election, About Schmidt, The Descendants and Nebraska, that I decided to watch it.Initially I was very glad I had changed my mind. The downsizing concept and plot around it was highly original and ambitious, making for an excellent Act 1. The set-up was superb: very engaging and interesting and I was eager to see where Payne went with the concept he had created.Unfortunately, the answer was 'nowhere'. Having created this world, Payne doesn't know what to do with it. The plot just drifts, has a dull storyline and ultimately makes no point or provides anything to care about. There's no focus: one moment it's a character-drama, next it's an eco-drama, next it's a romantic drama, and ultimately it tries to be all three, unsuccessfully. From a point I just wanted it to end, as soon as possible.I guess Alexander Payne had to make a poor movie eventually, and this is it.",Downsizing

As the top-billed cast member in DOWNSIZING, Mr. Damon stands AT LEAST five inches tall. Like Jimmie, I've seen Mr. Damon in Real Life. A few years back at a Major League Baseball playoff game, I witnessed him strutting along the Warning Track near the Visitor's Dugout prior to a game co-starring the Fat Cat New York Yankees. Hardly a tall figure, he was dwarfed by most of the Yankee players (not to mention the Yanks' bat boy). However, even at five six or so, it was not hard to see the validity in Kimmel's accusation of space-wasting. DOWNSIZING begs the question, ""Would the World be a Happier Place IF there were only five INCHES of Mr. Damon on-board?"" I suspect that even half a foot of MD still might prove too much for Jimmie. Fortunately for DOWNSIZING viewers, actress ""H. Chau"" clearly earns a ""Best Supporting"" gelded statuette nomination, if not the coveted prize itself. Equally certain is the fact that the Cinematic World is doing its best to address Kimmel's Complaint, first exiling Matt to the Fourth Planet in THE MARTIAN, and now lopping off 61 inches or so in DOWNSIZING.

Initially a drama, it becomes a comedy. Then we have straight sci-fi coupled with some social satire. Finally we have romance mashed up with ecological commentary.There is no reason why a film should not contain multiple elements. But, in this case, the elements don't work well together, and this is largely due to the writing. This is - or ought to be - a classic nerd film and, being a nerd, I was really looking forward to it.

13,AlsExGal,I feel almost alone in the world in liking this satirical sci-fi comedy-drama,7,14 September 2020,"When Norwegian scientists develop a means to shrink living things down to miniature size, with the average human standing only 5 inches tall, the world sees it as great new opportunity. ""Downsized"" people use less resources, take up less space, and have a smaller impact on the environment. As an added bonus, their ""full-size"" bank accounts translate to vastly more wealth at smaller size, since less material is needed to build dream mansions or create fabulous jewelry. Within a decade, ""downsized"" towns are springing up around the world, and middle-class Nebraskans Paul (Matt Damon) and Audrey (Kristen Wiig) make the decision to join the ""little people"". However, when complications ensue, Paul finds his worldview shattered, and he's left looking for new direction in his life.Director Alexander Payne (Election, Sideways, The Descendants, Nebraska) has a knack for character and the human condition. This movie, easily his biggest budgeted effort due to the special effects involved, loses a little of that thanks to the film's ambitions and the overreaching scope of the story. Payne seems to making some points about the lengths people will go to in hopes of achieving the upper class dream of many Americans, with the big house and country club aesthetics. Payne also spends time on the danger of climate change, and the last section of the film takes this to apocalyptic levels. Whether he's exaggerating for effect, comic or otherwise, he doesn't make clear, but it's also possible that he's being sincere in his fears. Damon serves his purpose well, as he's called on mainly to be a blank slate, a rather empty man looking for meaning in the world.The stand-out performances are from Christopher Waltz as Damon's obnoxious neighbor, and especially Hong Chau as a one-legged Vietnamese former political dissident turned janitorial worker. She's phenomenal, and should have nabbed a supporting Oscar nomination. The movie was a flop with both critics and the box office, but I liked it, and continue to look forward to Payne's work.",Downsizing

Add to this some really uninspiring and boring long speeches about our duty for the planet and other high brow things like that and you get a rather tepid movie.

Having delivered back-to-back films that offer heart, soul & humor, its only sensible to expect the best out of him. 'Downsizing', his most expensive film to date, with A-Lister Matt Damon in the lead role, surprisingly enough, belies all the expectations.The problem with 'Downsizing' is its Screenplay, Written by Payne & Jim Taylor. It has big ideas, despite being a story about going small, but ends up saying nothing, while trying to be everything. Let's get into that in a bit..'Downsizing' tells the story of a couple (Matt Damon & Kristen Wiig) who undertake a procedure to shrink their bodies so they can start a new life in an experimental community. When the wife refuses the procedure at the last minute, the husband has to reassess his life and choices.'Downsizing' begins as a film about a middle-class Omaha couple deciding to shrink themselves for a better life in dreamy land called Leisure Town, where shrinking yourself make your troubles & size, smaller. Now that's interesting! And 'Downsizing' works wonders until it works on the premise it promises to be.BUT, 'Downsizing' only flirts with the idea of going small, it instead, becomes a tonally jarring film, whose narrative is as broken as america's current political scenario.Right after Damon's passive protagonist hero shrinks himself, the film shifts gear into another rhythm that is surprisingly ineffective. So when Hong Chau (sensational & the best thing about this film) shows up as another tiny one, you are assured that 'Downsizing' isn't headed the way it started off. And just when Chau becomes the character you begin rooting for, the narrative suddenly turns into something catastrophic. By the time the 3rd plot kicked in, I had given up!Payne hasn't made a bad film, he has clearly made a confused film. Or is this 3 films into one film while being 3 in 1? Its this simple: It was about shrinking yourself for your own good. And it remains that for 45-minutes. But the rest of the 90-minutes, are nothing of what it was meant to be. The other track involving Chau's scene-stealing performance, is interesting for a bit, but it doesn't last beyond 25-minutes. And the last track involving a catastrophe, is devoid of any emotion. By the time 'Downsizing' ends, you'll be confused what too feel for it. And what was it trying to say? Shame, because Payne is a master at his craft.Barring Chau, No other performer really stands out. Damon is barely at his best, while Waltz at least has some fun. The rest are strictly okay.On the whole, 'Downsizing' aims big but falls pretty short. Ouch.",Downsizing

18,lasttimeisaw,a food-for-thought premise undermined by its inborn corollary,7,13 March 2018,"Adding to the sub-genre of body-shrinking Sci-Fi cinema, like Marvel's ANT-MAN (2015), Alexander Payne's long-in-gestation passion project DOWNSIZING emerges as a damp squib since its premier in Venice as the opening picture, both critically panned and tanked in the box office front, adding insult to injury by Matt Damon's inappropriate opinion apropos of the raging MeToo movement, it is a pity Payne's grand design is so scornfully overlooked. The central concept here is at once scintillating and grandiose, an irreversible ""downsizing"" process that compresses a normal human being into five-inch high, with its perks both humanistic (an eco-friendly last resort to earth's overpopulation quandary) and pragmatic (drastically increasing the value of one's money), you can see the appeal which drives the Omaha-resided Paul Safranek (Damon) and his wife Audrey (Wiig) to take the option on board, only the latter balks at the last minute to impel a downcast Paul to push that reset button in a mini-sized yet not very much different society, where social hierarchy takes its shape with a less costly criterion. From hobnobbing with his jet-setting neighbor Dusan (Waltz. hilariously obnoxious or vice versa) to dancing to the tunes of a Vietnamese political dissident Ngoc Lan Tran (Chau), who is downsized against her will, and the sole survivor of a smuggling attempt inside a TV set, which cost her one lower leg, and now works as a menial house-cleaner but still devotes herself in helping those who are less fortunate, Paul hits the whole gamut. So, what downsizing substantially alters is neither his milieu or the quality of life, but proffers an opportunity for Paul to meet new acquaintances, and in particular Ngoc Lan Tran, through whom he finds an elusive connection mingled with compassion, admiration and affection, and realizes what is the right thing to do when a second irrevocable option beckons. That said, Hong Chau's live-wire versatility is moderately crippled by Payne and his co-writer Jim Taylor's hackneyed treatment of Asian immigrant (coarse, bossy but not surprisingly with a heart of gold), and the short end of the stick she receives from a white-skinned middle-aged ordinary Joe, who patronizes her with a resigned obedience, and their ensuing romance is pointedly cringe-worthy under its context. On the other hand Damon is exceptionally nondescript to a point that we reckon even a one-legged Ngoc is too good for him, alas, a film with the same idea and production value can never veer its focal point to the minority character, which might reflect DOWNSIZING's retrograde core in the face of a futuristic conception.A food-for-thought premise undermined by its inborn corollary, DOWNSIZING only touches on the resultant strife between the big and the small communities (through a cameo from Patrick Gallagher), a topic has much more potential to burrow into than the simpler do-the-good-things boilerplate which we are received after its third act steeped in a Nordic Noah's ark evacuation, a missed opportunity nevertheless, Payne's film still can comfortably appease a none-too-judgemental soul with its eye-pleasing visual snappiness and a never-too-late message that is anything but vacuous.",Downsizing
19,Hellmant,"I enjoyed it, as I do all of Payne's movies.",8,4 January 2018,"'DOWNSIZING': Four Stars (Out of Five)A sci-fi comedy about a couple that takes part in a society experiment, which involves shrinking their bodies in order to fight climate change. The movie was directed by Alexander Payne, and it was scripted by Payne and Jim Taylor (the duo also teamed together on the screenplays for 'SIDEWAYS', 'ABOUT SCHMIDT', 'ELECTION' and others). It stars Matt Damon, Hong Chau, Christoph Waltz, Udo Kier, Jason Sudeikis and Kristen Wiig. The film has received mixed to positive reviews from critics, and it bombed at the Box Office. I enjoyed it, as I do all of Payne's movies.The story takes place in the near future, when scientists have came up with a revolutionary way to fight global warming, and over-population, by shrinking people to about 5 inches. Much of society rejects the idea (as they currently reject the solution of veganism), and the ones that do take part in the experiment are harassed and criticized (much like vegans are now). Paul and Audrey Safranek (Damon and Wiig) are one couple that decide to volunteer for the experiment. The film then follows their story. I love the premise for the film, and it's quite amusing to watch at times. Damon is good in the lead, and Chau is fantastic in her role. Payne is a very talented director and writer, and I love that he's willing to experiment (with mainstream filmmaking) by telling stories like this. It's a little too odd, and quirky, for most people, so I can see why it's failed at the Box Office. It's always interesting to watch though, and it had a lot of potential to be a great film, it's just a little too uneven in the end though. It's still a great filmmaking effort (even so) though.",Downsizing

21,bowmanblue,"Big concept, downsized execution",5,31 January 2018,"'Downsizing' looked really good from the trailer. Yes, don't all films? It's about - believe it or not - a world where, if you want to decrease your carbon footprint and get more for your money, you can be shrunk to a mere five inches tall and (effectively) live in a doll's house-like world with your friends and loved ones. I know the premise is a little 'out there,' but Matt Damon is the lead and it looked really funny. And it nearly was. The film had two major stumbling points for me. I was quite happy to suspend my disbelief in order to accept the plot. However, the first fault came because I'd seen the trailer. The film almost feels like two stories rolled into one. The first half is basically the trailer, only full-length. Therefore, if, like me, you've seen the trailer, then you've basically seen the entire first half of the movie - i.e. no shocks, surprises or new gags to come.Then, at roughly the halfway mark, it feels like a completely different writer took over control. The film ditches ninety per cent of its established characters and brings in a load of new ones. Not only this, but the whole film feels weirdly-different from everything that's set it up beforehand. The first half is like a quirky romantic comedy and the second turns into a deep drama with heady political messages about the environment.Matt Damon is likeable enough in the lead and if you're a huge fan of his then you'll enjoy it. The supporting cast all do their best, but it's the writing of the secondary characters that lets them down - they individual character arcs all seem totally unbelievable. It's like Darth Vader suddenly turning good halfway through the first 'Star Wars' film.Also, was it just me or did the special effects seem a little on the cheap-looking? With a story involving tiny people interacting with normal-sized people you'd expect them to blend the two seamlessly. However, much of it looked very 'blue-screen' esque.I know I'm sounding quite negative about it all, but, believe it or not, it is quite fun. There are definitely good jokes that land in there (well, mainly the first half) so it's not all bad. I just wished that it had chosen one particular genre and stuck with it, rather than trying to be everything all at once.",Downsizing

But when his wife backs out at the last minute and files for divorce, the pintsized Paul is left to languish with the other single little people (Christoph Waltz, Udo Kier).Highbrow director Alexander Payne's sci-fi satire on the current state of our social, environmental and economical woes, this wonderfully rendered lampoon lacks decent laughs and a sufficient climax to justify its politicalized POV or its pricey SPFX.Lastly, even though you're relatively the same height as one, never date a praying mantis.

23,851222,Highly enjoyable movie,9,22 April 2018,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Downsizing"" (2017) could have easily been made by Charlie Kaufman and Spike Jonze. Yet it was directed and partly written by one of my all time favorite Alexander Payne. I was kinda expecting to be this movie great, and i highly enjoyed the final production, yet if they could have gone trough a bit different pat near the ending, this movie could have been brilliant. Christoph Waltz stole every scene he was in. I also liked casting of Udo Kier (such a cult actor). Others were good, but except of Hong Chau as well (great performance) - nothing that memorable.The premise of this movie and story along were really original and fresh. The story is probably not for everyone, you kinda have to leave your disbelieve outside before watching this movie.Overall, ""Downsizing"" in my opinion was highly underrated movie. It flopped at the box office, and overall reactions were mixed. But if you want to see something made ""outside of the box"" yet very entertaining as well - ""Downsizing"" won't disappoint you as long as you simple go with it.",Downsizing
24,westsideschl,Thoughtful Message,8,8 April 2018,"I can see two major issues that might lend itself to so many one star ratings which are: First, it's an allegory which often requires thoughtful energy to process - not something most movie viewers are looking for. Second, it deals with a not so popular or discussed personal subject of over population, and its effects. The movie begins with this thought: ""overpopulation as mankind's (note: better humanity) single greatest long-term threat."" ""The cause of all the catastrophes we are seeing today, extreme climate & weather events... food & water security."" 
I guess they didn't want to mention the 8 million tons of plastic going into the oceans each year, and effects; accelerated extinction of species coupled w/loss of habitat; air, land, water pollution, waste buildup; loss of resources leading to conflicts, wars; altering millions years old Earth's biological balance w/consequences; the list goes on. If God is still looking down I'm sure he/she is wondering what is going on with the edict to multiply & master.
So, as for the downsizing effect my first reaction on CGI was ""How are they doing that?"" The miniaturization was so real, it was just bizarre & captivating to watch. Creative storytelling w/an interesting twist or two; OK acting w/the exception of Hong Chau who came close to Academy nomination for her role, and I couldn't tell if she was truly missing a lower leg.",Downsizing

Where a person is shrunk down to 5 inches in size and lives out there life in a miniature town/settlement. Because of the decreased size they receive increased wealth and live in luxury while leaving a smaller carbon footprint.Fantastic idea, both for a movie and perhaps the real world. I'd be interested in seeing a poll on the subject to gauge how many would be up for doing such a thing. So with such a genius concept the film will be great?

26,The-Sarkologist,Don't Expect Much,3,4 January 2018,"Honestly, I'm not really all that sure about this movie. In a way it is one of those films where they have this strange idea that changes the world, a random person decides to take advantage of it and discovers that it isn't all that it's cracked up to be, and then it basically degenerates into what is in effect a rather boring romantic comedy, and one that isn't all that funny. In fact, about it being funny, most of these films turn out not to be all that funny either, and this film is no exception.
 Anyway, in Downsizing, we have the discovery of the ability to make humans, and other animals, really, really small. The idea is revolutionary in that it means that people no longer consume as much and that it is going to be really great for the environment, and the Earth as a whole. Of course there are problems with it, namely that it isn't reversible, and that small people really don't help the economy all that much. However, there is also an upside in that the people that downsize suddenly discover that they are much more wealthier than they were when they were of a normal size.
 So, in comes Paul, who is an occupational therapist at a meat factory, and has discovered that his life really isn't going the way that he wants it to. So, he decides to convince his wife to downsize and take the plunge. So, they sell up, say their goodbyes, go in for the procedure, are separated because there is a boy's room and a girl's room, and when he wakes up he receives a call from his wife to learn that she has decided not to go ahead with the plan, and that she wants a divorce. So, all of a sudden he realises that his great plans of living the good life have all gone up in smoke. To make matters worse, he let his license expire so he can't even practice as an OT anymore.
 Well, I guess that pretty much describes what the film is about. Here he is, substantially smaller than your average human being, trapped in a strange world all alone, and to make matters worse, the millions that he was supposed to have had has suddenly all disappeared. Then again, to have his wife come along probably would have made a pretty short movie, and one as equally boring. Yep, when it comes down to it, if there is one thing that I can say about this film is that it is boring. Sure, he tries to get his life back together, and even goes on some dates, but in the end it seems to just end up the way it was before. Okay, it does end up having a happy ending, but then again it is a romantic comedy.
 Mind you, there are some interesting aspects to this film, such as that it is not all beer and skittles in this new world of the downsized. The thing is that unless you come here with money, then it turns out that it isn't all that great. For instance, it is much cheaper to employ a downsized person than it is to employ a full sized person, so suddenly all of the call centres end up here. Well, I really can't sympathise with Paul all that much since he is a fully qualified OT, and he could easily get a job doing OT stuff that does pay quite well, so him ending up in a call centre really is just another case of a person complaining about the state that they have ended up in, and doing nothing to change it.
 The other interesting thing is that there is a suggestion that the downsizing method is used to deal with people's enemy's, and there are much cheaper options that end up being a lot riskier as well. Also, there happens to be ghettos here as well, and we are taken into one to see the life that they live. The interesting thing is that people seem to be a lot less wasteful, but then again the person that collects food and medicines not only is very persuasive, but also quite well known.
 In the end though, there really isn't all that much about this film to make it stand out, and, as I suggested, I found it pretty boring. Okay, they do address some issues, such as climate change, and human rights abuses, but it seems more like a sledge hammer approach, and quite defeatist, than anything else. Oh, and if there is one thing that comes out of this film, and that is the idea of running away and hiding as opposed to at least attempting to make people's lives that little bit better by attempting to relieve their suffering. Oh, and if there is anything we have learnt from Biodome, and that is that when you cram a bunch of people into a small space, they will inevitably end up tearing each other's throat's out.",Downsizing
27,cruise01,Downsizing really downsizes on plot and maintaining a straight focus with its storytelling.,6,23 March 2018,"Downsizing (3 out of 5 stars).Downsizing is a science fiction drama comedy movie about an invented procedure to shrink people and living in new communities. Paul (Matt Damon) and his wife Audrey (Kristen Wiig) both see this as an new opportunity to start their lives after struggling with debt and trying to afford a new property. Downsizing was going to help them financially as they live like kings in these communities. Downsizing is an okay film. It has a good concept but the script and direction does not really know how to maintain a proper focus with the story. It was all over with its theme that the movie was trying to convey. What worked with Downsizing? It does have its decent performances from Matt Damon, Kristen Wiig, Hong Chau, and Christoph Waltz. Damon was good playing a occupational therapist, who is eager to help anyone to make better decisions with their lives. Wiig had more of a smaller role; playing his wife but she was also okay. Waltz plays Pauls neighbor, who throws big parties and tries to live a king lifestyle. The concept started it out neat. Inventions were people could downsize to help out with the rest of the worlds problems from consumption. That is also were the film struggles with its themes. The script had problems trying to solve the issues with the concept. Basically, were people are divided with the idea of downsizing. Normal size people see this idea of getting small is a cheap way out. Were questions like, do they get the same equal treatment with voting? Is downsizing a solution to saving the planet from its own consumption on resources? In the end, the film loses the answers to all the questions it begins with. Paul and his friends come across a Norwegian colony where they built an underground community that can last for hundreds of years after the world has fallen apart from pollution. Especially, when they discuss about the polar caps melting and affecting the ocean water. The script still does not know how to handle on answering any of these questions.Another bad thing about the film. The film is also kind of boring after the first hour. Were Paul is trying to find himself through this self discovery phase. On were he fits in this huge world. He is such a nice guy that puts everyone else before him by helping them out. Overall, Downsizing is a fair film. The cast is okay. The concept is interesting and could have been so much more. But it falls short with its storytelling. The script fails to answer its own questions that it opens up about society. And it does have its satire of a theme that is poorly put together. Also, the movie gets boring and for a running time of 2 hours and 15 minutes. It feels overly long and drags on which they could have trimmed the movie down.",Downsizing
28,Floated2,Interesting concept of ideas,8,5 September 2018,"Downsizing may have seemed as a flop at the box office, due to its high budget expenses but overall the film is a lot better than several reviews and its IMDB rating shows. Much of the criticsm comes from people apparently being mislead by its trailer. Several of the trailers make it seem as if the film is a family friendly comedy, which it may sort of starts that way then descendes into a further interesting concept and thoughtful drama.Matt Damon is great as usual as one of his better roles portraying a charater in which he has played before. Though the other supporting cast whih enter in the second half of the film steal the show, Christoph Waltz and Hong Chau.Downsizing is a lot better than expected and for a film over two hours, it doesn't quite drag on as it may seem. The film is filled with a very interesting concept and ideas that keep the film engaging throughout. Their is a strong message in the film about finding oneself and living for the better, as showed throughout. It is a shame the film was such a flop since this was one of the better films to come out last year during the holidays. Perhaps had they scheduled this film for the summer or earlier in the year, and not in December around awards season, Downsizing could have seen a bigger raise in profit. Highly recommend, give the film a chance.",Downsizing
29,TheMovieDiorama,Downsizing shrinks its intriguing premise into a story of minuscule proportions.,4,7 July 2019,"There's nothing more infuriating then observing a genius concept become mere waste. It's like staring at a light bulb as it flickers for two hours, waiting for its filament to burst. Downsizing offers so much promise. It grants the audience a new smaller perspective on life (literally!). However the disappointment rapidly kicked in as soon as our leading man undergone body reduction, to which the script must've been reduced with him. Overpopulation threatens humanity, and a new scientific breakthrough in shrinking fauna and flora has just surfaced, persuading an American couple to change their lives forever. Except, rather predictably, the wife decides to change her mind last minute. Oops!There's a message hidden within these small societies. Humanity's environmental impact is destroying the planet. Overpopulation results in a rapid increase in climate change and pollution levels. So, theoretically, shrinking life on Earth would result in more space for everyone and less detrimental effects to the environment. Right? Well, that's what the first act brilliantly carved. Director Payne focuses the story on the building of this concept. The economical, societal, and environmental changes that would occur. Residential paradises being constructed to safely house ""small"" people. The arguments of having equality with ""normal"" sized people, such as paying taxes and the right to vote. There's a subtle commentary on racial divide, by using body anthropometrics instead, and the first act gently touched upon these themes that really the entire film needed to address.Unfortunately, once Matt Damon becomes Mini Damon, Payne loses all control of direction. The proceeding hour and a half is an absolute shambles. Aimless, flat and bordering on boring. The intent focus on the concept is sidelined for a story about life reassessment. Seeking purpose, love and happiness. It unfortunately doesn't work. There's not enough substance in the meandering plot to keep audiences invested, as we observe raucous parties and house cleaning. The second act seemingly follows Paul follow an impoverished activist follow sick people follow death. The third act then randomly turns into a cult apocalyptic event that came out of literally nowhere. And that pretty much sums up the screenplay. It's purposefully unpredictable to the point that it itself becomes pointless, losing all vital substance from the first act. Attempting to maintain a light tone, Payne is unable to retain purpose, as if trying to appeal to mainstream audiences and awarding bodies simultaneously. Such a shame.Miniature characters are tossed around as if they were in a suitcase at an airport. A talented cast including Waltz, Wiig, Sudeikis and even a cameo from Dern, were utterly nullified by a flat screenplay. Damon holds the film on his shoulders as much as he can, and Chau gave a decent performance despite her character almost being viewed as a caricature of Vietnamese culture. But it's not enough to bypass the flimsy story. Even the superimposing of miniature humans against the backdrop of the world from our perspective, which was surprisingly well executed if mostly noticeable, cannot overlook the snooze inducing last hour. I found myself slowly falling asleep to the lack of direction, and that's not like Payne considering his past directorial efforts.Like I said, I despise fantastic concepts being wasted. I haven't felt this disappointed with an innovative societal-changing idea since 'In Time', and even then at least that film had a direction. This film will keep shrinking in my mind, to the point that it is purely unobservable and completely forgotten about. Shame.",Downsizing
30,southdavid,Downscale your expectations.,7,19 February 2018,"Expectation might be the deciding factor in whether or not you enjoy ""Downsizing"", the latest film from Alexander Payne, of ""Election"" and ""Sideways"" fame. The trailer presents the film like a broad comedy with some science fiction elements, when it actuality, ""Downsizing"" is a meandering but likable tale about personal happiness and sacrifice, where the shrinking concept is largely irrelevant after the first third of the film. In the near future Scientist have perfected a method of reducing living people to a fraction of their size, in order to save the planet (given the significant reduction in resources that a smaller human race would require). Via the conduit of Paul Safranek, a compassionate but dispirited occupational therapist, the film explores the issues that surround the noble but controversial procedure. As I said above, the film takes a meandering path through a number of topics that might surround this procedure if it was really to happen. Discrimination, smuggling, exploitation but environmentalism is probably the key one - and the one that the films comes back to at the end. At heart, it's a social satire - no matter how things change, they ultimately stay the same and even being given the key to saving our planet, we'd be too lazy or frightened to do anything about it. Another misleading aspect of the trailer was that it increases the significance of Kirsten Wiig and Jason Sudeikis and barely even shows Hong Chau despite her character really being the second lead and her performance being the most memorable aspect of the film I can understand the disappointment that is reflected in some of the reviews on here. The trailer promises things that the film doesn't even try to deliver, but rewards do come with patience and thought and it has stayed with me, long after the credits have rolled.",Downsizing
31,imseeg,"Expect a caring, satirical story about saving humans from extinction caused by global warming. It is NOT a movie about funny miniature people.",7,29 May 2018,"After seeing ""Downsizing"" I now understand where the bad reviews originate from. This movie was marketed to the masses as a funny miniature movie, while it's message of how to deal with global warming, is probably only engaging for an arthouse movie crowd. It is truly an intelligent, righteous, thought provoking and caring movie. Like ALL movies from director Alexander Payne are. But however good (7 stars) this picture might be, lots of people went to see it expecting something entirely different. Just to avoid more frustrations based on the wrong expectations, I have made a short list by which you can check if this movie will annoy you depending on your expactations. You probably WONT be pleased if you are someone who doesnt believe global warming is caused by oil and coal companies that burn fossil fuels in massive quantities. It is though. 98% of the climate scientists say so, based on decades of research. You WONT be pleased either if you are expecting a fun movie with Kristen Wiig because she only performs a meager 10-15 minutes. You WONT be pleased either if you expect a straight story with Matt Damon whom you so admire from his Jason Bourne actionhero movies. Because in ""Downsizing"" Matt Damon plays a humble and sensitive normal person, who wants to take care of poor and foreign people in need. You WONT be pleased either if you are expecting a funny miniature movie. It is NOT about that at all. ""Downsizing"" is ALL about global warming and the dangers it exposes to us as humans. And it is about the choices we can make. It truly is a unique piece of work. Hilarious at only a few moments, because it is not a real comedy. Jokes are made tongue in cheek, in a satirical way. That sort of humor/drama isnt understood by the masses. This movie is really intelligent and heartwarming. But what it really is, is baffling. Because ""Downsizing"" depicts OUR world. We live in it. We have responsibilities to act upon the dangers global warming exposes our children to. We can choose to make a difference. Or we can stay indifferent. ""Downsizing"" is a mirror to our consumer society which runs on oil and coal and if we dont act soon the CO2 emissions will destroy the world as we know it through global warming. I love people who dare hold up mirrors to our society at large. Most people dont like to be told something is wrong with the way we live nowadays however. Alexander Payne is one of the very few directors who dared to try to hold this mirror up to our way of life. I recommend this picture VERY MUCH to all those who DO wanna care about our children's future, who DO wanna care about stopping global warming. These pictures are very rare nowadays, but we need them NOW more than ever before...It took Alexander Payne 10 years to get this movie made, because the subject of the story is not very popular. It is certainly not his best work, but it is his most RELEVANT one. Because in the end we all have to ask ourselves the question WHAT we can do to guarantee a prosperous and safe future for our very own children and grandchildren. This picture was director Alexander Payne's most personal one. He dedicated it to his late father George, who died on the very day this movie premiered...",Downsizing

This is a mess of a movie. It's not just a straight comedy, although it does have a few comical scenes. It jumps around from one topic to another without finishing what was started. It just seems like they weren't real sure in what direction they wanted to go in. Anyway, the plot goes something like this: Norwegian scientists develop a safe way to shrink people down to about 5 inches tall, saying that it is to save the planet's overpopulation problem. Small people take up less space, use less resources, etc. Matt and Kristen play a married couple that decide to do their part and shrink-there is also a nice perk that their money goes a lot further as little people, making them millionaires. In a politically incorrect moment, a normal sized man asks Matt-in a bar-if little people should have the same rights as him. Then, a big left turn with Kristen out of the picture and Matt is now working with Hong, a Vietnamese woman that was shrunk down against her will, as a punishment-She now cleans houses for the little people. Christoph plays Matt's neighbor in Lilliput land and he likes to party a lot. Of the 4 main actors, Hong was the best one to watch. She had some of the funniest lines but she was hard to understand sometimes-her accent.

If hair must be removed because it won't miniaturize, what about nails? While the small-town had its slum-dwelling servants, it had no ""heavy"" industry to make the tiny cars and buses, and the tiny wrenches and appliances, etc. Did they have to depend on the big people for all of that? Sounds expensive, and risky, especially since so many of the normal people deeply resent the downsized. And why would anyone risk making themselves so vulnerable? One drunk or out-of-control motorist could lay waste to a small-town, with mass casualties. Or a small tornado, etc. And although they tried to gloss over it on the Norway colony, they would be at extreme risk from insects, birds, small snakes, crows, foxes, etc. 
And the Ngoc Lan Tran character was an extreme stereotype. If a conservative studio (assuming that there was such a thing) had made this, they would be ruthlessly excoriated for their ""insensitivity"". Nothing against Hong Chau, who basically stole the show. But the double standard is breathtaking.

37,Pairic,Surprises abound in this thought provoking film.,8,25 January 2018,"Downsizing: Science-Fiction/Satire/Serious Comedy. Hoping to save the planet from depletion of resources, global warming and overpopulation a Norwegian scientist (Rolf Lassgard) invents a process to reduce humans to 5% of their normal height and a tiny fraction of their mass. Years later Paul (Mark Damon) and his wife Audrey (Kristen Wiig) decide to downsize to take advantage of the more affordable lifestyle in Leisureland and live like royalty. Audrey backs out at the last moment (after Paul has been shrunk) and the resulting divorce leaves Paul living in ""reduced"" circumstances in an apartment rather than a mansion and working at a call centre.Things pick up however when Paul's becomes friends with his new upstairs neighbours, Dusan (Christoph Waltz) and Konrad (Udo Kier). After one of their wild parties, Paul meets cleaning woman Ngoc ( Hong Chau) who had come to the US as a downsized refugee in a television box. We then see there are even more layers to the Downsized world.The downsizing process is presented in a comic manner and the script keeps the laughs going throughout the film but this is very much a serious comedy and social satire. Paul is reduced in status (even after downsizing) from upper class to middle/working class but then encounters an underclass which carry out the menial tasks. Whilst Leisureland is high-tech (climate-controlled under a dome) and even Paul's apartment faces a marina the casual workers live outside the walls of Leisureland in makeshift accomodation under netting. Ngoc is a local leader who looks after the sick and old inhabitants of this favella and co-opts occupational therapist Paul as a doctor. After that things get even stranger as Paul and Ngoc travel to another downsized community with Dusan and Konrad. Surprises abound in this thought provoking film.

Instead, the stage is set for a near-future society that, in order to help ""save the Earth,"" shrinks people down to five inches. When certain characters bring this environmental message up, it's usually with shrugged sarcasm - as if to get that out of the way in order for the Matt Damon Romantic Comedy to begin...Yet even the first act isn't funny, and unlike Payne's road movies ABOUT SCHMIDT, SIDEWAYS and THE DESCENDANTS, it's not one bit interesting either.Imagine a plotless theme-only story about a kindhearted man living in partial wealth until becoming concerned with a lower class community, and then deciding whether to join a European hippie cult to live underground in order to preserve the human race for the Climate Change apocalypse that's not only around the corner, it's heading right for us (just like Hollywood predicted Nuclear War was eminent, especially during the 1980's... until exactly 1992). Without the title ingredient that's supposed to make this an ironic and quirky, what-if semi-satire, DOWNSIZING would be a bleeding heart without a body. Yet there's still no pulse or purpose here at all. With an annoying love-interest (a Vietnamese actress who will be nominated for an Oscar), a dull leading man, and a buried social message (more obvious than even TOMORROWLAND), let's hope the otherwise brilliant director Alexander Payne got all the Left Wing sermonizing out of his system, and create more indies about people to care about instead of what feels like an overlong first chapter of a Global Warning disaster film.

It is a film big on issues and small on ideas. After a promising start that spoofs America's obsession with fads, corporate corruption, and personal greed, the film takes a surprising u-turn and veers into preachy ecological territory, losing its comic edge and becoming a overwrought parable about self discovery. Matt Damon plays Paul, an Everyman looking for the best in all possible worlds and the actor is well-suited for this role. This modern day Candide thinks he has found a utopian world in Leisureland, a Disneyland paradise that miniaturizes people and transports them to a world of wealth and pleasure. At least, that is the message worth believing to these elite few.The premise for this pre-fabricated gated community for the under 5 inch community has many comic opportunities in contrasting our big vs. small universes and much of that goal is incorporated in the film's first half. But then the tone of the film sifts dramatically and gets more serious about poverty, class warfare, environmental issues, and immigration. It is at this midway point that the film loses all of its sense of humor and slogs its way to an absurd finish.The scattered screenplay by the director and co-writer Jim Taylor goes wildly off track. The plot becomes convoluted and exasperating, in need or major rewrites. Characters are introduced and lost midway with less interesting ones added. One such role, , an annoying Vietnamese housekeeper is well played by Hong Chau, who makes this part far more appealing than it deserves. The actress steals the movie cold and makes this poorly written stereotypical harpy role memorable with her acting choices. However, one never believes any attraction or chemistry between her and Mr. Damon, who suddenly goes from idealistic hero to helpless doofus for no real reason. Fine actors such as Christoph Waltz, Jason Sudakis, and Kristen Wiig are wasted in smaller or ill-conceived parts. Other characters played by Laura Dern, Neil Patrick Harris and Margo Martindale who become cameos in need of more screen time.Visually, the CGI is mostly effectively done, but the props and production design have a problem with size proportioning that is glaringly off and inconsistent when it should be more accurate to make the film concept resonate. Mr. Payne may have let his ego and oversized imagination get the best of him. In the case of Downsizing, this usually strong director loses his focus and his vision, entirely missing the big picture. Let's hope he will grow from his small missteps like this wonky film.",Downsizing

-Cinematography
-The Acting
-The MoralsDISLIKES
Pace
-Aimless Plot 
-DepressingSummary: Depending on the trailer you have seen, Downsizing may be a different movie than you expected. The film is a brilliant display of cinematography, blending special effects and scenery to create a world that feels a merge of both small and big people. These artistic visuals are one half of the heart of the movie and a beautiful representation of the world Hollywood can create. In addition, the acting helps portray a real life discussion on key issues with Damon, Waltz, and Chau playing an awkward triangle that spreads across the emotional spectrum of ethic code of humanity. And it's through these characters and movies that you will get to take sides and develop your thoughts on a plethora of political issues that plague the world, only rather than it being a documentary it's a Hollywood drama so a little more fun. 
 On the downside though, the movie mainly suffers from what seems aimless direction in terms of developing an evolving plot. The film's number of political issues are crammed tightly into the 2 hour run time and many never really take off before migrating to yet another issue to discuss. Eventually a few common themes take root, but by this point the movie is nearly over and these moments (including a romance moment) fizzle out into wafting embers. Because of this indecisiveness, the movie feels a little slow and boring at times, which when mixed with the crushing weight of the issues, leaves one a little tired than entertained despite the clever writing and comedy. 
 Overall, the movie is an award-winning spectacle in terms of presentation of moral integrity vs. the temptations humanity presents itself. However, I think the movie misses the story telling, fun element the first trailers promised because it tried to cover too much in one movie. Many of these moments almost didn't need to exist in the grand scheme of the tale leading to unnecessary length. In addition, the depressing food for thought may not have been timed well for a holiday movie, but hey got to get it in for the Oscars. While not the most entertaining, this film is a beauty in its own right as a dramatized documentary on life itself. Worth a trip to the theater? Can't say yes during the holidays, but you might think of going at the start of the new year. Otherwise rent this bad boy for a conversation starter.",Downsizing
44,richard-1787,An interesting fantasy,7,23 December 2017,"This is an interesting fantasy: what would it be like if some people agreed to be shrunk to just 5"" tall and communities were built just for them?We soon find out that most of the individuals who decide to get downsized do it not out of any altruism, but rather because at 5"" they can have the sort of McMansion they were lusting after while they were living in their perfectly decent middle-class homes. Most of these people are frustrated consumers.Not surprisingly, their downsized worlds are very bland. The American ones look like retirement communities built around golf courses. The homes are full of reproductions of van Gogh, Klimt, and other great artists, but it's all very antiseptic.Then, about half-way through the movie, Matt Damon's character sees that there is a different small world outside the walls of the perfectly manicured one into which he bought, full of the same sort of slums the regular-sized world contains. He meets a social activist, and from there on the social satire gets more and more preachy.And then, in the end, it becomes a chick flick, and love triumphs over ideals.Damon does a fine job with his part. He is perhaps the best thing about this movie. Other than that, the characters are pretty thinly written.",Downsizing

It was comedy like & had a light hearted, quirky tone to it. But sadly that wasn't the case after I watched the film. Glad I'm not the only one who thought the exact same thing about it derailing & losing it's way after 30 minutes in... & I'll tell you why...The film, is basically about a couple who decide to be shrunk to 5 inches after an experiment in downsizing is recently on the cards for those wanting to live a better life. The 2 minute & 30 second trailer demonstrates the first 30 minutes of this film perfectly, but misses out the boring, ugly parts which came afterwards.Now, it might've been me, but I almost forgot that this film had to have a story-line & a twist of some kind to it, all films do, but I never thought that, thinking that be the misleading trailer, it was going to be a funny, light hearted comedy about downsizing & that the whole film was to be centered around that concept alone with the little guys doing some funny things in the real world/own world they lived in! But that sadly didn't happen.So, although the film demonstrates that 30 minutes in, it begins to derail & lose it way. It goes from being light hearted to a serious, bland, boring & pretty grim film with no resolved ending of any kind. There were parts which seemed off, in fact quite a few parts & very few of which I found amusing! Which is a shame considering this film could've been a hell of a lot better!The mean spirited part of the wife leaving Paul while he was 5 inches was just plain mean to him & the viewers! And to make it worse, we don't ever see her again throughout the film, no resolution no revenge, nothing! The film I also felt went nowhere & simply didn't have anywhere to go after the first half hour! It was ridiculous! The film forgot what it was suppose to be about & from then on, except shots of them shown on planes & buses being super small, you forgot just that, not other obvious signs they were 5 inches small, another reason & big part of the film which was clearly lost & forgotten!The rest of the film was a bland, dull blur & simply had a every vague & subtle point/twist, then it just ended! No resolved ending, nothing! That was make whack! Done! Boo! Overall, a disappointing film which could've been far better! Less serious & dark, not to mention dull, bland, boring & grim! And more, light hearted, quirky, exciting funny & just a great film living up to its concept! Sadly, the film lost its way & forgot what it was supposed to be about! So disappointing!

50,bkrauser-81-311064,Bewilderingly Bad,2,25 December 2017,"Downsizing is what happens when you have what you think is a killer script and instead of fast-tracking it you tweak it and tinker and move things around, forget about it, dig it back up, tinker some more and repeat for about a decade. I'm still processing what I had to put up with in order to finish this drab, sanctimonious little bait-and-switch but I tell you what, if the goal was to leave audiences depressed, angry and bewildered, good f**king job!Downsizing starts on the heels of a startling, earth-shattering discovery. Scientists in Norway have developed a method of miniaturization that can shrink most organic matter including humans to 0.6% normal size thereby creating a safe, practical solution to overpopulation. Seeing the process of downsizing as a way to start over, Paul Safranek (Damon) and wife Audrey (Wiig) decide to retire in a Sunbelt mini-community where they can theoretically live like kings.As you can imagine things don't entirely go according to plan but don't expect the highfalutin high-concept of the film go anywhere beyond the first thirty minutes of the movie. For Downsizing isn't about ambitious sci-fi technology or for that matter economic, social or political satire. No this is a movie all about how to find piece-of-mind and self-identity. And what better way to portray that than having a thankless, rudderless, middle class white dude played by Matt Damon mulling about for two hours and fifteen minutes?This movie is the perfect storm of simpering self-righteousness, wafer-thin plodding and meandering false bravado. It takes the usual Alexander Payne, man-on-the-edge setup, arms it with an environmental message and a bullhorn and proceeds to rebuke its audience for being alive. It thinks it's being clever; it's really just taking the banal and making it insufferable.The unfortunate and uncomfortable part of that banality is it comes at the expense of one decent and true performance on the part of Hong Chau. The demure Thai actress plays a miniaturized Vietnamese refugee who more-or-less becomes the angel on Damon's shoulders. There was much controversy in early screenings concerning Chau's accent but given that the choice was a well thought out and actually quite touching decision on the part of Chau, it becomes clear that the problem isn't really her. It's everything around her that turns the vibrant Ngoc Lan Tran into a cartoon character; the best comparison I can come up with is it's like putting a Jane Austen character into a Todd Phillips directed sex comedy - you'd notice, and you know it wouldn't work.Had we started everything from the point of view of Ngoc Lan Tran or at the very least shifted the story to the 40 minute mark...it'd still suck but stop just short of being a catastrophic misfire on par with Exit to Eden (1994). But instead we're stuck with a milquetoast, well-meaning but complacent ""everyman"" whose fatal flaw can be corrected thanks to a manic pixie dream exile and his vaguely European upstairs neighbor (Waltz).All this is punctuated by some of the most flaccid, cloying and obvious moments of social satire ever put on film. Half the time I was convinced the script was written not by director Alexander Payne but a precocious ten-year-old who suddenly found out how the other half lives. The other half of the time, I sat with my arms folded bracing for the next sermon on humanity's inability to merry selfishness with virtue - the film seeming to smile in a smug grimace every god***n time. There's even a particularly tasteless and preachy thread taking place on the wrong side of tiny town that was one Sarah McLachlan song away from making me want to strangle a pelican.And of course I can't end without restating the sad fact that the high-concept; people deciding to be mini, is incidental to the plot. You take that aspect of the film away and almost nothing would change. Perhaps that's part of the point thematically, but those looking for a grown-up version of Honey I Shrunk the Kids (1989), i.e. most everyone who saw the trailer, will instead need to get themselves a tank of sea monkeys.Downsizing is the most disappointing movies of the year by far. It writes a check it has no intention of honoring then chastises its audience for falling for the ruse. I long for the days when Alexander Payne's misanthropic worldview informed his films with wit, irony and a sense of dour humanism. For now when we need it most, Payne has instead retreated into his barrel and left this tiny little turd on our doorstep.",Downsizing

59,sharky_55,What a waste. What a dreadful waste.,5,11 May 2018,"I should feel a little more sorry for Paul Safranek, shouldn't I? After all, that is how Alexander Payne's leading men operate, as pity projects that gradually expose a side of humility through mishaps and misfortune. Their epiphanies usually lie near the end of the film, not afforded a conventional three-act structure to train up for their eventual redemption; that's just the cards that life has dealt them. And yet Paul's moment of realisation comes not as an eventuality of his faults but rather as something that the plot demands must happen. It's sparked by some vague notion of true love and true calling in a murky tunnel (further undercut by the fact that it's almost like he only turns around because he doesn't want to make the 11 hour trek). Instead of character growth, it's deflation. That Payne has already pulled our protagonist through the usual markers of middle-aged monotony sours it further. After Paul is unceremoniously dumped by his girlfriend he shuffles upstairs to the party, and lo and behold, some exotic pretty young thing is there to dispense (via tongue) illicit drugs. The visuals then collapse on themselves in a hallucinatory daydream, urging Paul to ... do absolutely nothing. This is a different kind of pity from Payne's usual leads; while previously we hope for a glimmer of redemption but also acknowledge the long and difficult (if even possible) journey there, here it's just pathetic. Paul is utterly inert, the kind of guy whose idea of fulfillment is handing out sandwiches to the poor and making romantic passes at women he hardly knows. Downsizing never grows beyond its promising opening, where it flashes social satire in the premise of minute, sustainable living, but then descends into cheap visual gags for the sake of it (giant rings, giant roses, giant pens etcetera). The entire final third of the film seems to take place in a shrunken Norway, complete with mini fjords and vistas. It's as if Payne simply forgets the revolutionary technology that he opens with (framed through a realist lens with press conferences and breaking headlines) and reverts to a watered down version of his middle-aged coming of age narrative. There may be some sort of hidden wisdom in there; even something as drastically life-changing can't alter the biases and prejudices that are inherent in human society, but Payne brushes that political aspect off for a pedestrian romance. It's not only that Ngoc Lan Tran's the 21st century equivalent of Short Round, with a heavy Vietnamese accent automatically puncturing any serious moment (the romantic confession scene is the worst passage of dialogue that Payne and Taylor have ever written, bar none), it's also the fact that her origins resemble little more than backstory padding. There's an entire world of ethical and moral dilemmas that downsizing technology raises, only for the film to sharply swerve into mawkish territory. Has Payne ever delivered such a tonal disaster? Even the resolution of The Descendants, precious as it is, knows how painfully unfinished the King family's mourning period is. We sit with them on that couch.

62,rockman182,Downsizing (2017),6,31 December 2017,"What an interesting concept for a film. Its incredibly creative and it makes you think about how the world would be if downsizing was actually a plausible thing. Healthier for resources, spacing, agriculture, and you could live more lavishly with less money. I would probably consider it. Getting back to the film though; it was unfortunately quite disappointed. A film of two halves with an entertaining first and a boring tepid second act.The film follows Paul Safranek (Matt Damon) who decides that becoming smaller would be suitable for him and his wife, especially because he's in a pinch for money and is looking for change. On the day of the procedure his wife chickens out, leaving him alone to try out the massive change in lifestyle. Everything seems great at first, until Paul notices the underbelly of downsizing and some of the negative consequences involved.I thought the first half was very intriguing. The concept, as mentioned earlier, is innovative and left me curious. The film does a good job of showing the procedure and how life is once you are downsized. Its quite good until the time Matt Damon takes drugs at a party and is passed out on his neighbors floor. Then the film just changes. It becomes too politically charged about differences of social classes and how the other half lives. This is fine but it didn't work in this film. The last act is going to make your head scratch and you will wonder how the film even got to that point.Brilliant idea, poor execution in its finale is the only way to describe this. Hong Chau is quite great in this, and deserves her praises but once her character gets involved the film has much less to do with downsizing and more to do with a film that means to well and is trying to wrap things up in a cheery way filled with love and togetherness. I know Alexander Payne is capable of better which is why I'm disappointed with the writing in this. The film is overlong especially with a second and third act that seems bizarrely placed and is not as interesting.5.5/10",Downsizing
63,Benjamin-M-Weilert,A semi-comedy that is probably too smart for its own good.,6,8 March 2019,"In the last decade, I've come to appreciate Alexander Payne's films. From The Descendants (2011) to Nebraska (2013), it was clear he was improving as a director. I had high hopes for his latest work, Downsizing (2017) since the premise seemed interesting and ripe for social satire like his previous films. For a movie about becoming small, Downsizing certainly had big ambitions. Unfortunately, it means that this film was kind of all over the place. Sure, there was a somewhat logical progression of events, but even the main character was flabbergasted at the coincidence of it all.While I would fault the movie for Hong Chau's clipped English, as it almost seemed culturally insensitive at first, eventually the character grows on the viewer. This leads to a very touching ending. Instead, I will fault the science behind this science fiction. I was half-expecting a lot of sight gags on how ordinary objects are much bigger with shrunken humans (a la The Borrowers), which Downsizing delivered on a couple of times. However, if inorganic material cannot be shrunk, then how are there whole communities with small-scale items (like lightbulbs, prosthetics, etc.) that would need to be manufactured in the smaller scale?I'm still trying to get my head around how cerebral this movie was. With no clear focus (and a few sequences that were a smidge too long), I had trouble determining if the satire was on the contrast between rich and poor (paralleled with big vs. small), or if it was a statement about human interaction with the environment. I get that the term ""downsizing"" is applied in many aspects of this film, from the actual shrinking process to shedding all the meaningless materialism of our existences, but even the open-ended ending left me wanting just a little bit more closure on everything.A semi-comedy that is probably too smart for its own good, I give Downsizing 3.0 stars out of 5.",Downsizing
64,RforFilm,It's ironic that a movie called Downsizing doesn't have something bigger to say.,4,22 December 2017,"What is the American dream? For a lot of people, it's simply to be wealthy for the sake of their family. But as we're further influenced by the media, the definition of wealthy becomes skewed. What should be a simple dream to be sure that your family is never too worried about money, suddenly becomes bigger with fantasies of mansions and private jets. There's nothing wrong with dreaming big as people are free to do what they wish with their earnings. But consider how a lot of lottery winners lose their wealth; they'll go out and buy everything they've ever wanted, but never dig into their own personal problems that have prevented them from becoming rich in the first place. It's all design, but no substance. Money has been proven to solve some, but not all problems. Anyone can just throw money to make a quick fix, but what about permanent solutions? Isn't that another definition of acquiring wealth? To finds ways to figure out what makes us unhappy? As life has shown, easy answers are rare. Whether a problem is a society one or a personal one, that requires a different kind of work that no money can fix. Downsizing cuts into that factor.In the near future, scientists have fostered a way to shrink humanity to not only solve an environmental crisis, but to provide a new gateway to riches; smaller people means smaller usage of resources, therefore, a dollhouse can now become a mansion. This has lured a lot of people into ""downsizing"", but of course there is a catch; it's irreversible. So those that go in are staying that size. This doesn't seem to bother occupational therapist Paul (played by Matt Damon) and his wife Audrey (played by Kristen Wiig) who are financially strapped and want an easier life. Though Paul goes through with it, Audrey backs out and files for a divorce, leaving the poor guy in the same boat he was at full size; unhappy.Now living in an apartment, he's taken a call center job for Lands End while trying to figure out what to do with himself. Along the way, he encounters a party animal neighbor Dusan (played by Christopher Waltz) and a Vietnamese housecleaner Ngoc Lan Tran (played by Hong Chau) who was once a political prisoner, shrunken against her will. These people put Paul to the test on whether ""downsizing"" really does fix humanities problems.I have to give Downsizing a lot of credit for ambition. It's a good setup that could be examined heavily. Director Alexander Payne (Nebraska, The Descendants) certainty knew that and tries to examine a lot of issues like climate change, refugee crises, and class separation. Rather then crafting a flow and mixture, the script seems to throw everything into a blender, hoping that part of it sticks. This results in not only a clunky narrative that can't seem to pick a plot, but tone that's uneven, trying to mix Midwestern dilemma to science fiction to fantasy-like utopia. Alexander Payne is better at directing his actors, as everyone feels right at home. Matt Damon does well as an ordinary man whose trying to find purpose. Christoph Waltz again plays eccentric and goofy in a playful manner, even if we've seen it before. My favorite is the one that people will be split on, Hong Chau. One the one hand, she plays a stereotype of an Asian immigrant who speaks broken English. I should be angry at this,,, but not only is she great playing that stereotype, but she's heartfelt in a way that we really root for her. So why couldn't Alexander Payne had taken the same care with the script as his other movies? It seems that he should have either picked one of the many issues he brings up and go at it or really work on the script to craft something bigger. The story that is presented just seems to bring up an issue, drop it, go for another, maybe return to an old one and... that's pretty much Downsizing. Without giving anything away, the overall moral seems to be ""Love thy neighbor"". Not only does it feel very redundant and a rushed answer to everything, but other movies like It's a Wonderful Life have tackled that philosophy better. I'll give this four yellow roses out of ten. Downsizing in an unfortunate dud from one of my favorite directors. It's ironic that a movie about shrunken people couldn't have said something larger. It's dull and rambling...a lot like that great uncle relative you have whose nice, but lacks anything of true worth. Let this shrink into nothing.",Downsizing
65,cultfilmfan,Downsizing,9,27 December 2017,"When, I first read that Alexander Payne, a filmmaker I have come to really admire and also enjoy the films of over the years was going to make a film about shrinking people and putting them into miniature societies, the whole thing sounded off to me and like it could not be any farther than his usual fare which for the most part is expertly done satires, or great characterizations about human beings in general to what can make them great, but mostly I think Payne likes to portray them more in a realistic light showcasing their warts and all and totally not shying away with showing the things that are downright unlikable, or even loathsome about them. Downsizing sounded to me more like an idea of a television sitcom that I would never even want to bother to sit through for 22 minutes plus commercials and the fact that the reviews coming out of various film festivals were for the most part pretty negative even more soured my opinion of the film and I more or less just thought that I would skip it when it came to my local multiplex theatre and maybe not even bother with it when it came to streaming. As the release date of the film came closer and closer, the reviews in a strong majority were mostly negative and I would have gone with my initial impulse to skip the film entirely, but then I read in a small blurb where Jonathan Rosenbaum (one of my most admired and also most influential film reviewers in my opinion) had posted earlier reviews of Alexander Payne films that he had seen and for the most part would give them a mediocre, or even a scathing review when it came to something like Payne's first film Citizen Ruth, as well as Sideways, which was a film I could not warm up to when I first saw it and although subsequent viewings have enhanced my overall opinion of the film, I would still consider Election, About Schmidt and Nebraska to have been his best work to date and his film, The Descendants, was to me a very immature and at times ridiculous film that I would consider his weakest, if not worst film to date and please keep in mind that I have never seen Citizen Ruth, in it's entirety, but I know Rosenbaum found it to be overly cynical and was overall offended by the film and it's crass depiction of subject matter considering whether to be pro choice, or pro life when it comes to a woman's pregnancy. Rosenbaum said in a quick little blurb that as of now, he considered Downsizing to be Payne's best work to date and as I usually agree and respect his opinion very much I overall gave in and decided to give Downsizing a chance even though I expected it to be more or less a sellout picture by Payne by giving in to Hollywood demands and standards and yet pleasantly I could not have enjoyed the picture more, or have been more wrong about it. The plotline about shrinking human beings and placing them into small communities just seemed to be a basic outline of the film that I would say does not even cover about fifty, or more percent of the film's plot, or running time. Instead we are given a film that gives us a lot to think about, be in some ways encouraged by and also a film that is as far from a commerical film that you could want and thankfully steers away from any and all sitcom like material. The film asks big questions about one's own meaning in life and what our actual purpose here is on this earth. Payne presents us with a character who has lost a lot in the process of becoming small, but at the same time by helping others by donating not just his time, but putting others instead of himself and overall showing great acts of love and charity, he not only discovers how good it makes him feel inside, but perhaps he has a bigger purpose in life than just looking after his own needs, but instead helping out those less fortunate than himself and this is what will truly anchor him in life and give him happiness. The film at times has some good laughs, but really it is more of a thinking person's drama which addresses the issues I mentioned above about own's own destiny and self worth, but it also takes a look at the environment and just how as a human race we truly do in a lot of ways need to focus less on ourselves and more not just on other people, but also where we live, breathe and call home as well. This is a film that tackles a lot of big questions and does it's best job to answer them, but in the end I found myself deeply moved by what I saw as well as thinking that although this is not marketed as a Christmas film, it perfectly fits the bill of a film dealing with one who gives selflessly and to help others and also just a celebration of who we are as human beings and the overall message to love and how giving is so much better than receiving. If you look at the real meaning of Christmas this is what it is all about and I don't know what Payne personally believes faith wise, but he has constructed a thinking man's film that as well as giving you much to reflect upon will also touch your heart and may just inspire you to do more with your life as well. I was so glad this film was entirely different from the trailers I saw and I hope people will give it a chance and see where this film will take them.",Downsizing
66,bankofmarquis,Wish it was more like the trailer,5,6 January 2018,"From time to time I'll head into a cinema to watch a film and discover that the film I am watching is a much, much different type of film than the marketing campaign leading up to it has led us to believe. Mostly, it happens with a Director that doesn't quite fit a mold. For example, this past fall, the Darren Aronofsky film, mother! was billed as a horror film - which it most certainly was not, (I'm still not quite sure what it was that I watched then).Same can be said for Alexander Payne's DOWNSIZING. If you see the trailers for this film, you'd think it is a Matt Damon light comedy - with Kristen Wiig and Jason Sudekis - doing a modern take on Gulliver and the Lilliputians. However, that is NOT what this film is. It is a serious study of a man trying to find his place in the world. He uses the downsizing to escape his life, only to find out it helped him find a life.See...movie studios...it's not that hard to describe.Consequently, my enjoyment of this film was tapered somewhat by me needing to adjust my mind to what I was watching. Once I did, I could enjoy the film for what it is - an interesting character study with a few interesting characters. I could also focus on the flaws. It is not really one film, it is a series of 5 or 6 vignettes strung together to form a film.Unfortunately, these strung together scenes don't really coalesce into a cohesive whole so the film, ultimately, doesn't work for me.There are quite a few things that work - Matt Damon's sympathetic performance in the central role of Paul Safranek and once he is teamed up with Hong Chau (as Ngoc Lan Tran) the film seems to find it's footing - for awhile. Christoph Walz is winning as Paul's upstairs ""downsized"" neighbor who is unabashed in his ability to bootleg ""normal sized"" things (like a bottle of vodka) into this little world. I could have used more of this.I also could have used more Wiig and Sudekis - as it is, they were in extended cameos.Unfortunately, Director and Writer Payne seems more interested, and consequently spends more time on, the problems of Global population and Global warming, so the downsizing plotline seems to be tacked on (and shoehorned back in at the end) - you could have easily had a film of someone who just moved (and not downsized) and you would have, essentially, the same film. I also must confess that Payne's films (most notably SIDEWAYS and THE DESCENDENTS) have left me somewhat cold and this film has done nothing to change my mind about him.There are some good elements in this film, but not enough for me to recommend it.Letter Grade: C+5 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)",Downsizing

68,spookyrat1,Downsized Satire!,4,7 September 2020,"Alexander Payne's Downsized is certainly one strange movie. Promoted as a social satire, it remains that way for no more than around 45 minutes before diffusing into more of a social commentary on capitalism and consumerism, before making another turn into a bugged out apocalyptic feature, that doesn't really make a lot of sense. Like many other reviewers here, I think Payne should have stuck with his original idea; that's the one the trailers promote, generally ignoring the add ons.The first act is indeed quite creatively clever and rather funny. It's actually a really good set-up for a different, shorter, funnier movie in which the now 5 inch Paul has to adjust to his new life in Leisureland, without big wife Audrey who's remained on the outside. Instead all of a sudden we're introduced to this underclass living in squalid slums outside Leisureland and expected to accept that no-one knew anything like this was occurring. There's very little exposition and what we get comes from Tran's almost cartoon - like, Asian accented delivery of her lines, which makes it somewhat difficult to fully comprehend. But I gathered that the downsizing industry is being rorted by countries using the technology to exile undesirables, such as Tran.Once again, there may have been the makings of a semi-decent conspiracy film there, but no, then Payne decides to dally with the end of the world. What was he thinking? Plot holes begin to open up like huge fissures across the narrative. The action switches to Norwegian fjords. And all of a sudden the little people are piloting miniature boats across the fjords, whereas in previous scenes adjustments have been made in normal - sized planes and buses to accommodate their tiny size. Fjords are the ocean for goodness sake. Toy boats plying the ocean? And then we find the ""original "" tiny village, built right down on the edge of a fjord, apparently unaffected by tides, swell, inclement weather and animal life. By this time in this overlong film, I was laughing again, but not at the film's content, rather its shoddy narrative construction and failed, attempted genre mix.Payne's earlier low to medium budget films are definitely worth a look. But no one in their right mind should have waved a $100 million budget in front of this fellow. Downsizing is an example of what misguided satire can result in. What starts as a decent idea is ditched less than halfway through its runtime. The experience feels like three different movies, and all of them startlingly disconnected from each other.",Downsizing
69,MihaiSorinToma,Yet another fail of a great concept,3,19 September 2018,"After an unprecedented discovery which can shrink people to approximately 5 inches tall, Paul, a young and helpful man, decides to go small as there he could live the life of a rich man, without any worries or troubles. Soon, he discovers that not all is as he hoped, especially regarding his wife, so he'll soon have some other problems to face once in the land of the small people.Although it sounded like a great idea, with the whole downsizing discovery and also with the new cities for small people, this movie managed to create an incredibly boring story. Although very linear, it also tends to be unpredictable, but unfortunately not in a good way, as the characters have a tendency of making very questionable decisions, to say the least. It presents a course of very boring events which always seem to point to nowhere, completely missing the idea of the downsizing. Furthermore, it almost doesn't have an intrigue. You're eager to find out how it is in the small world, which also seems to take forever without any reason, but from there on, it's just plain stupid.The characters are completely forgettable and dull, not to say that they can become pretty unlikeable, making the already bad and uninteresting story even worse. The actors don't do anything special unfortunately, even if they really have the skills to do so; not that they could do something to such an awful plot. The simple fact that they accepted roles in such a movie raises some serious questions, at least from my point of view. You could have easily replaced them (the main ones at least) with anyone as unknown as you wanted and still get the same result.This movie is supposed to be a drama but I would blatantly lie to you if I say that I found something even remotely dramatic about it. It's just about a man which simply doesn't know what to do with his life and as a result, he seems to make random decisions, hoping that all will miraculously become better overnight. As a result, you get not emotion, no suspense, no nothing...I know I keep repeating myself but I become more and more tired of seeing movies with such good or even great ideas which don't have any idea what to do with them. You have the downsizing concept, you have a couple of very good actors and you still aren't able to come with at least a decent plot which to keep the viewer even a bit interested in what you're presenting to him. I go so bored that I almost fell asleep many times, even getting to the point of wanting to skip ahead.

72,bob-the-movie-man,"Tiny People, Big Mess.",4,26 January 2018,"From the trailer this film looked quirky, funny and interesting and has been on my ""looking forward to"" list for many months. Oh dear, what a let down.Matt Damon (""The Martian"", ""The Great Wall"", ""Jason Bourne"") and Kristen Wiig (""mother!"", ""Ghostbusters"") play Paul and Audrey Safranek. Paul is a laid-back and hardworking occupational therapist; Audrey has materialistic ambitions over and above their available finances. The two decide to ""downsize"" making use of a revolutionary Norwegian invention that reduces humans, and most other lifeforms, to a fraction of their normal size. This offers huge wealth to the normal American, since the cost of living in downsized form within the mini-estate called LeisureLand is tiny in comparison to ""big folks"". But all does not go well in the transition (unlike the trailer, no spoilers here) and Paul needs to find a new purpose in life as bigger problems loom.It's clearly written to be a social satire, and there are some clever angles to be explored here: everyone publicly positions their downsizing based on 'environmental issues' and 'saving the planet', but most everyone's real reason is the lifestyle benefits. Also lightly touched on, but never deeply explored, are the impacts that the downsizing initiative is having on the broader American economy and property markets, with the 'big people' questioning why small people should have the same rights and votes as them. But the film never really gets into the meat of any of this. Worse than that, the movie never settles on what it is trying to be. I think we can write off ""Sci-Fi"" pretty early on. But is it a drama? A comedy? A love story? A socialist rant? An environmental cri de coeur? The film jumbles all these aspects together and treats each so halfheartedly that none of them get properly addressed.Not only are the audience confused: none of the actors seem to be too sure why they're there either. Damon - never Mr Personality - should have been able to develop some chemistry with the feisty and dynamic Ms Wiig, but even these early scenes plod along with you thinking ""what a dull film"". Things perk up slightly at the LeisureLand sales fair, where Neil Patrick Harris (""Gone Girl"") and a naked Laura Dern (""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"") glibly try to sell a luxury doll's house to the assembled crowd. American consumerism in miniature.But post-downsizing the film crashes back to 'Dullesville Arizona' again, but with added depression, requiring Christophe Waltz (""Django Unchanined"", ""Spectre""), as a dodgy Serbian entrepreneur Dusan Mirkovic, to over-act manically to try to add any sort of energy into the film (which he is only mildly successful at doing). There's a rather bizarre supporting role from Udo Kier - looking for all the world like Terence Stamp - as Mirkovic's ship-owning pal, and an almost cameo performance from Jason Sudeikis (""Colossal""). Enter stage-left Thai-born Hong Chau as Ngoc Lan Tran, a Vietnamese cleaner. There's a clever angle here: where ""average American Joes"" like Safranek can live like kings, but the poor still have to scrape by, living in 'skyscraper Portacabins', as the menial classes: there's no escaping class structures, even when 5 inches tall. Chau sums up the uneven nature of the film, as she mostly plays her lines for laughs but then (in a spectacularly good bit of acting in the midst of, I have to say, some pretty poor hamming) bursts into uncontrollable tears.Just when you think things are going to limp to a unmemorable close, the film ups and leaves LeisureLand to add a completely bizarre final act. (It's pretty unusual in the UK for people to walk out of a cinema mid-film, but a couple did so at this point). This segment bears no relationship to the downsizing theme whatsoever, since all the players at this point could be full-sized. Aside from an amusing ""50 shades of f**k"" speech from Ngoc Lan Tran and a ""massive explosion"", this story goes nowhere, says nothing (at least not to me) and merely irritates. Throw in a completely anti-climatic non-ending and I genuinely shared a ""WTF look"" with the stranger sat next to me!This is all very strange, since this comes from Alexander Payne, who also directed and co-wrote ""The Descendants"", one of the most impressive films of the decade. Jim Taylor co-writes (as he has co-written numerous other films with Payne). I note that in this morning's London Times that their film critic, Kevin Maher - someone who's views I am generally pretty well aligned with - gave it 4 *'s out of 5. I can only assume that he either saw a completely different cut of the film, or he is a lot cleverer than I am and understood amazing sub-texts that completely passed me by! Maybe... but I have a sneaking suspicion that the general viewing public will more share my opinion on this than his.I was tempted to give this just one * as it was such a disappointment to me, but the underlying concept is a good one: it is just one that has, in my humble opinion, been implemented in a bizarrely slipshod manner. Definitely not recommended. Go and see ""Coco"" instead!",Downsizing
73,kjproulx,"Original, But Poorly Executed",6,22 December 2017,"From Sideways, to Nebraska, to The Descendants, and even Paris, je t'aime, I've pretty much loved everything that I've seen from director Alexander Payne, making Downsizing one of my most anticipated films of 2017. Having heard so little about the film aside from its concept, I went into the screening fairly cold. Sadly, the film doesn't have a whole lot more to offer than its brilliant concept and exceptional first act. I must admit that I left feeling disappointed, thinking they could've made this a better movie in many ways. When a film has so much promise and doesn't exactly deliver on much of it, I feel as though many people would be let down by that. Here is why I believe everyone should see Downsizing, despite it being slightly too mediocre as a final product.In this dramedy, which also in part a social satire of its own genre, Downsizing follows a couple who believes their lives would be better if they were to shrink themselves and be transferred to a new world called Leisureland. This place exists to conserve the Earth and save the environment, by these shrunken people needed much fewer resources. With multiple meanings to the title, this is a concept that sounds incredible on paper but doesn't exactly translate into that great of a movie. Throughout the first act, I found myself immersed in this world and couldn't wait to be taken on its journey, but I soon found myself losing interest when political and religious elements began to take over. This is a movie that could've done so much more with its premise.Without giving anything away, there are many characters that come in and out of this film in a heartbeat, pretty much leaving them in the dust, when in reality they were actually interesting and added a layer to the overall story. It felt as though Alexander Payne wanted to focus so much on the idea of the Downsizing concept, that he sidelined quite a few characters along the way. His films have always been about characters, and while Paul (Matt Damon) and Ngoc (Hong Chau) share some great chemistry throughout this film, it's hard not to wish that all of the characters throughout the first act were present throughout the entire film. This was a very curious issue I had while watching and definitely upon reflection.As soon as you're brought into this other world that has been built for those who shrunk themselves over the years, you will find yourself kind of transfixed at how interesting the visuals are and how well the comedic aspects come into play, but what you don't expect is for the film to take a dramatic turn and really have you thinking hard about the world we live in and whether or not certain lines of dialogue are true about society in general. This is an eye-opening film in that regard and the third act is incredibly ambitious, but I just don't think it really sticks the landing that it strives to achieve.In the end, this is one of the most original ideas I can recall in recent memory, but an idea doesn't make a film great. It's the film itself that needs to win you over as a whole, and Downsizing just didn't do that for me. On many accounts, this is a very impressive movie from a technical standpoint and it takes risks that I didn't expect it to, but the risks it takes will only work for a few audiences members that can relate to it.This is a movie that promises a lot and tries to deliver on all of those promises, while also shoving in side plots that make this film too emotionally complex to really be invested in the satirical aspects by the end. I wish this film went through a few more rewrites, because there is a satirical masterpiece of a movie in here somewhere, but it's just not the product that you'll be seeing in theatres soon. Downsizing is worth your time in terms of originality, but I wouldn't get your hopes up on it being a favorite of yours.",Downsizing

I liked the idea and the trailer makes it look like a comedy. It should be a comedy, but don't expect it to be or you'll be disappointed, the ending is full of environmental messages and warnings!We already know that the human race is destroying the planet. The answer is to use a pioneering process to shrink people to 5 inches, so that they need fewer resources and generate less waste. The clear message delivered was that mankind will soon be extinct in its current state. A possible answer is provided in the utopia of Leisure Land in a miniature state. The concept is an interesting idea that Matt Damon and Kirsten Wigg's character's take up. They separate since they need to progress through separate male / female treatment channels. However, Damon goes through with it, but Wigg gets cold feet and changes her mind. Their marriage cannot survive and Wigg soon abandons their seemingly happy marriage.Damon meets a one-legged Vietnamese house cleaner, who has been downsized against her will, her contribution to this film is a highpoint, and she steals every scene, most of my 6 stars are awarded to her! Unfortunately, humans tend to find a way to abuse any environments they inhabit, we see that corruption finds its way into Leisure Land as well before the abrupt end.Finally, Matt Damon was completely miscast!

77,Headturner1,Hmm,5,29 August 2019,"I saw the trailer for this while back and thought it looked cool. I'm surprised everyone thought the first half of the movie was so great. The fist 15 ( I think) or so minutes all about the downsizing stuff could have been left out. And I agree after he downsized it basically was just like watching a movie with regular sized people. I didn't see anyone comment on the irony that is most people did out of greed, not to save the environment and now are probably going to be the first to go. Anyways it was ok. I thought the story was fine. I did lol at a few scenes and when they got to Norway the visuals were beautiful. Matt Damon really did look so average and not his hunky self( not that I think he's so great looking) but you can tell they tried to make him look like an average pot bellied kind of balding with wrinkles 30 or 40 something. Now my review makes about a much sense as the movie. Lol. All and all it was ok but downsizing had nothing to do with the movie really.",Downsizing
78,SameirAli,"Not the best, but, Awesome.",8,20 December 2017,"Alexander Payne and Matt Damon, these names are enough to make the movie ""A Must Watch"".Highly recommended that you just watch the movie without doing any research. Because it may spoil all the fun :).It's a science fiction movie. But, it's from Alexander Payne. So, it is different. In a society where the over population is killing the earth, a man discovers a new technique, to shrink the people into almost our inches. Thus reducing the pollution and wastage of the resources. The process is called Downsizing. As the process is a huge success, Paul Safranek and his wife are attracted to this process. They decide to undergo Downsizing. But, if everything goes right, there is no more movie. Yet, expect the unexpected, because as I said it's a Alexander Payne movie.It's an amazing social satire, that starts in a normal pace, then makes you laugh a lot, and then into drama.Excellent performances from the cast and crew. Cannot conclude the review without mentioning Christoph Waltz. He gave enormous energy to the film. His role was amazing and he nailed it.Do not miss it. You will love the movie.

He promised the idea a lot, but he stayed on the surface",5,2 May 2018,"Y es que cuando vi el tráiler en el cine, pensé, que idea más estupenda, a ver luego hacia donde la lleva. Como no, cuando la ves, pues se cae. Es raro que la haya explotado, en los días que vivimos hoy en los que la venta de cambio climático vende mucho, pensaba que iba a aprovechar para vender su idea, pero no, se decanta por ser más comercial y superficial.
El caso es que la estoy viendo y me empiezan a surgir muchas dudas y preguntas que os diré en la zona spoiler. Los actores están bien, si están bien, aunque hacia el final, se estropea todo.La fotografía está bastante bien. Es agradable de ver.La dirección debería haber sido más espectacular. Sería lo suyo en esta película, aprovechar la ocasión para hacer planos bonitos. A medida que avanza se va cayendo y se va hacia comedia tonta.Si la hubiese hecho en plan crítica seria, seguro que habría sido más interesante, estuvieses de acuerdo o no con sus postulados.And it is that when I saw the trailer in the cinema, I thought, what a great idea, to see then where it leads. Of course, when you see it, it falls. It is rare that it has exploded, in the days that we live today in which the sale of climate change sells a lot, he thought he would take advantage to sell his idea, but no, he opts to be more commercial and superficial.
The fact is that I am seeing it and I begin to raise many questions and questions that I will tell you in the spoiler zone.The actors are fine, if they are fine, although towards the end, everything is ruined.The photography is pretty good. It's nice to see.The address should have been more spectacular. It would be his in this movie, take the opportunity to make beautiful shots. As it progresses it falls down and goes towards silly comedy.If I had done it in a serious critical way, I'm sure it would have been more interesting, whether or not you agreed with its postulates.Spoiler:
Por ejemplo, ¿si se hacen todos pequeños, quien va a producir ciudades y cosas enormes después? Antes sí, claro es fácil pero luego. 
¿Hay ya tiendas y fábricas de todo tipo de cosas para ese tamaño?
A medida que avanza la película y veo gente trabajando en ese mundo, pero ¿Cómo es que hay gente que trabaja, pero es que no es un paraíso? ¿Por qué hacerse pequeño antes de conseguir algo de dinero para no poder ser rico? Que es una crítica al capitalismo está claro, pero ver a la gente apilada en ese mundo me extraña, en ese mundo todo el mundo tiene mucho más.
¿Por qué Matt de repente es pobre? Un divorcio sin hijos no te hace pobre. Y ¿porque alguien que llega sabiendo lo que Matt sabe, porque no lo aprovecha para vivir mejor aunque ayude a los demás?For example, if they are all made small, who will produce cities and huge things later? Before yes, of course it's easy but then.
Are there already stores and factories of all kinds of things for that size?
As the movie progresses and I see people working in that world, but how is it that there are people who work, but is it not a paradise? Why get small before you get some money so you can not be rich? That is a criticism of capitalism is clear, but seeing people piled up in that world misses me, in that world everyone has much more.
Why is Matt suddenly poor? A divorce without children does not make you poor. And because someone who comes knowing what Matt knows, because he does not take advantage of it to live better even if he helps others?",Downsizing
80,MrDHWong,"An interesting, yet underwhelming satire about humanity's impact on the environment and the desperate urge to correct it",6,28 December 2017,"Downsizing is a comedy-drama starring Matt Damon. Directed and co-written by Alexander Payne (Sideways, About Schmidt), the film is an interesting, yet underwhelming satire about humanity's impact on the environment and the desperate urge to correct it.In the not-too-distant future, scientists in Norway have invented an irreversible process where humans can be shrunk down in size to just five inches tall. The process, known as ""Downsizing"", is considered environmentally friendly and also comes with several financial benefits to those who go through with it. A married couple from Omaha, Paul (Matt Damon) and Audrey (Kristen Wiig) Safranek, decide to undergo the treatment in hopes of a better life away from their monetary issues in the real world.While there's no doubt that the subject matter and premise is solid, the execution feels weak and mediocre, likely because the film overstays its welcome. There was no need for the film to run for over two hours, and in doing so, the tone is constantly and confusingly shifting between comedic and emotional without warning. However, the great special effects and unique charm are enough to keep one's interest for the most part. Matt Damon gives a nice performance of someone adjusting to life as a five inch tall man in a big world, but it is Hong Chau as Vietnamese activist Ngoc Lan Tran who stands out the most.",Downsizing
81,Alexander_Blanchett,Downsizing ended after 30 minutes.,5,31 January 2018,"What a wasted potential. The plot outline was brilliant and it offered a great concept for a very interesting movie that makes you curious to watch. Then you have a mastermind like Alexander Payne behind the camera and a great leading actor like Matt Damon, so what could possibly go wrong? Well ... losing ideas. Because this is what happened here. The first 30-45 minutes were great and full of energy and great ideas, then it feels like Payne abruptly ran out of ideas and just created a new plot, which is more than the second half of the film, that doesnt really have much to do with the original concept anymore. That is what went wrong and it is a shame. Maybe it would have worked as a short film (no pun intended). Matt Damon sleepwalked through the film and probably didn't really know what to do with that thing either, I don't think he handled his character very well or rather did not really care for it. Christoph Waltz was irritating and unfortunately gave a very disappointing performance. Also what was this accent?! Same goes to Udo Kier. Kristen Wiig was built up well, but just like the prime plot motive she just disappears. Some nice cameos like from Laura Dern and Jason Sudekis. The best part of it was definitely Hong Chau who delivers a fantastic performance full of energy. She is really the only reason to watch this film. She does so much with so little and puts so many different emotions and facettes into her character. Its great. Next to her, Damon appeared to be even duller. The soundtrack was a bit annoying at times, but at least it had some nice images. Still, kudos for the first third but Payne really needed a script doctor for this.",Downsizing
82,CANpatbuck3664,Better Than I Thought it Was Going to Be,7,4 January 2018,"I didn't circle the release date for Downsizing on my calendar. I thought the trailer looked cheesy and not being an Alexander Payne fan, I was willing to just wait for it to come out on Netflix. But I ended up going to see it anyway and I came away pleased with the movie. The first thing I want to talk about is that the movie covers more angles of the fallout of downsizing then you would think. Should these people have equal voting rights? Do they pay income tax? What happens to the areas that people vacate to downsize? Could you really leave your family and friends behind? They answer these questions and many more. This might make the movie seem boring but it was interesting to me. It gives you room to imagine how radical and shocking it would be for this process to suddenly come available.Downsizing is billed as being heavily comedic, does the comedy work? I don't think the movie is ever gut-busting funny, but I did find myself laughing here and there. Some of the gags they do with the difference in size are interesting and I was wasn't groaning because anything fell flat.Downsizing features good performances from both the main and supporting cast. Matt Damon is painted as the every-man with dreams of a better future and to his credit, he navigates the rough seas this movie puts him through to deliver a solid performance. Hong Chau is impressive as Ngoc Lan Tran. I bought into her relationship with Matt's character more than some other reviewers did. This was also a difficult character but she made it work. I would mention though that while her accent is close to being authentic, I still would have dialed it back a little. That's not her natural dialect and I could see some people being offended by it. Christoph Waltz is good, he's better in the dramatic bits, I just don't think he's particularly funny. Kristen Wiig is fine, she's in the movie less than you would think but she's solid. I get why people didn't enjoy this movie. For one, the marketing is very misleading. The trailers are selling you a comedy with a heart. Downsizing has those moments, but it lacks any kind of consistency in tone. It jumps from goofy to extremely dark and back again. You can split this movie into parts. The first part is more like the trailer, its not slapstick comedy but it sets up these ideas and it tries not to get bogged down by giving you some levity. The next part is more of a commentary on our current economic system. In the final part, they transition to be an environmental message movie. This didn't bother me as much as it did some of the other reviewers, but you have to hold the movie to task for promising one thing and then not delivering on it. It also makes the movie frustrating to view as it toys with your expectations.A lot of people really love Alexander Payne's previous movies. I'm not one of those people, I think he's talented, but he doesn't make movies that I particularly gravitate to (I've only seen Election and The Descendants but I still didn't like them). But even knowing that, I still was pleasantly surprised by this. Sure, the movie is heavy-handed about what its trying to get across and the tone wanders like someone who is new to the Downsizing community. But it does have a lot of interesting ideas, there's some good commentary on how things work in our world today and I enjoyed the performances enough to go along with the movie. I don't think its a must-see movie in theatres but if you're open to its message, I think seeing Downsizing on Blu-ray or Netflix would be absolutely worthwhile.",Downsizing
83,cliftonofun,"Small people, oversized plot",5,22 March 2020,"I did not have many expectations here, honestly. Yes, it was Alexander Payne. Yes, it was an intriguing concept. But that's literally all I knew. In the end, I felt like the first half worked way better than the second half. The introduction of the characters and world really pulled me in initially. Plus, the sense that human problems and inequity could not be easily escaped really resonated. But the story definitely felt uneven from there, and...odd. It seemed like a couple different movies crammed into one. As a result, the stakes never felt that high, and I never cared that much. Also, there were a LOT of plot holes that I found almost as distracting as the strange sense of humor. So you end up with a mixed bag. It isn't bad. But it isn't good either.",Downsizing
84,apryla-58795,Downsized the thought process here,5,4 January 2019,"This would not have been all that bad had the director been able to figure out what kind of movie he was trying to make. It's certainly not the worst movie I've seen. Its just that you feel duped after you start watching it. This was marketed and portrayed as a comedy so that's what I was expecting. We get a little bit of comedy at the beginning, then it turned into a romance and then it finally ended as a drama. Was that the point? Or did the director lose focus? I mean I guess this movie kind of follows how the downsizing was presented to Matt Damon. He went into it thinking it was gonna be one thing and it turned out to be very different than what he was expecting. Was that deliberate on the director's part or did this movie just go off the rails?I knew this was a political film about a half hour into it; but I could not figure out what side, issue or cause they were trying to promote. After awhile I think the point was that no matter where we are we harm the environment. Also Americans are greedy and wasteful. We want to live in luxury and not work so badly that we will actually shrink ourselves in order to be able to have more. In one way that's true but aren't we all a little bit tired of being portrayed as terrible people? We've progressed in life and we like our modern conveniences. That's why we aren't a third world country and everyone wants to come and live here. What should we do? Give up everything in order to redeem ourselves? That would present a whole new set of problems.Maybe I'm reading into it too much or assigning meaning to something that wasn't meant the way I took it BUT I thought that scene where Matt, Christoph and the ""yacht guy"" were trying to extricate Matt from his situation with Hong was a reference to how Americans insist on sticking their noses in everything and then when the object of their ""dogooderism"" becomes too demanding we just leave after we muck everything up. It bothered me that Matt insinuated himself into Hong's life and then breaks her prosthetic so she can't get around. After helping for a couple weeks he is getting tired of helping her so he concocts a story in order to be done with her. Seems like something political was going on with that scene.Matt Damon was very meh in this. He was reduced to being a supporting character. Christoph Waltz and Hong Chau stole the show BUT her voice was annoying and her ears were so BIG that I found it difficult to focus on her performance.A few questions why was Margo Martindale and Mary Kay Place in this? They were wasted and their parts were so unnecessary.Who ran the ""small"" community? Were regular sized humans tending to it? Or did they just build it and then turn it over to the little people to run and maintain?Why did everyone seem to not care for the Norwegian blond woman who greeted them? They never explained why? That was random.Why are they going underground right then if the human race won't be extinct for another 100 years?There are a lot more questions that I have but it's late and I'm tired and quite frankly this movie wasn't worth my time so I think I'll just leave it at that.",Downsizing

This is, as far as I know, an original idea and Hollywood rarely comes out with something truly original.But once that happens, it becomes just a regular, boring story with some cool effects. It's like once these people are ""downsized"" it's your standard Hollywood fare. Whole swaths of the movie could have taken place in the normal sized world and it wouldn't have made a difference. I felt there really needed to be a comparison as to this wonderful life the downsized had compared to their big people. Things like Matt Damon enjoying his new downsized life, living it up, occasionally interacting with really big things and getting some humor out of it.

Why do I get the feeling that these pint-sized people are just one rabid pit bull away from annihilation, in a world where giant things are always victimizing small things, it even somehow seems unrealistic that the giants wouldn't smoosh one of the tinies once in a while when they're having a bad day.

90,ethanbresnett,A fun concept which never really got going,4,7 March 2020,"The premise of Downsizing was very intriguing, and had all the necessary parts to become a great sci-fi film. However the result was just a bit of a mess. I think the more interesting issues to explore would have been between the small people and the normal sized humans. A character raised it earlier about whether small people should retain the same rights as other humans. The issue of abusing the technology was touched on but never fully explored either, and I think either of these would have made much more interesting central issues to focus on.What really disappointed me about this film was its lack of direction in the plot. It took far too long for this film to get going, with perhaps a third of it taking place outside of small world. That's the attraction of the film so all of the faffing around before hand felt drawn out and unnecessary. Once we were in small world the Downsizing couldn't seem to decide what sort of film it wanted to be. I found myself rather lost with what they were trying to achieve and so much of what happened in the small world seemed inconsequential or overly ridiculous.As I mentioned earlier what would have been interesting would have been if there were a conflict between the small people and regular humans, and the film focused around that. Instead it found itself bogged down in a relatively mundane story, nothing out of the ordinary other than the fact that they were small.The characters were largely uninspiring and could have been used much better. There was a criminal waste of Christoph Waltz, and Matt Damon felt like he phoned in his performance. Hong Chau was the saving grace that managed to bump Downsizing up by at least a star, with her performance adding comedy and emotion to an otherwise flat experience.At times the film dragged, particularly in the sequence demonstrating the Downsizing process which seemed to last an eternity. This whole sequence could have been cut as the film was far too long for what it was.Ultimately Downsizing was a waste. A waste of acting talent, a waste of a promising concept, and a waste of my time.",Downsizing
91,bbewnylorac,Downsize your expectations,6,29 December 2017,"Downsizing is a disappointing execution of a brilliant idea. This movie reminded me a lot of La La Land - great set design, good acting and painstakingly slick scene set-ups. But it left me strangely unmoved. The script, especially in the second half, feels like it was written either by committee, or by someone more concerned with visuals than with a plot or narrative. After the amusing and very interesting depiction of Matt Damon character's life in the normal world, followed by what he has to go through to be shrunk and live in Leisureland, the movie becomes quite bland. It can't decide whether it's a light comedy, or whether it's a serious comment piece on refugees and on the Western fixation with consumerism.
There is not enough action (i.e. things happening) in this movie. The creators choose to go with a small number of slow and elongated scenes, instead of snappy and exciting plot developments. I was interested in the plot of the Vietnamese political activist who has been forcibly shrunk, and then has been the sole survivor of a smuggling attempt to America that killed all her co-voyagers. She is now a fierce aid worker for Leisureland's under-class, and she enlists Matt Damon's character to help her. This plot had great potential to highlight the plight of refugees in real life, and also it touches on how shallow many of us are - worrying about having more space and acquiring material things, when they're not the things that matter. But instead of exploring this, the movie segues into blander things, such as Matt Damon going to a rave party, befriending some eccentric neighbours, sailing (interminably) in a Norwegian fjord, and hanging out in the idyllic original Norwegian 'small people' community. It's all very nice and picturesque (shades of La La Land again) but what does it all mean? 
I was offended by a bizarrely crude exchange between the couple involving multiple utterances of the ''f'' word towards the end - it was as though one of the movie's committee of writers or producers said, ""hmm, this movie is a little slow, how can we fire things up""? I.e. it came across as a cheap trick, a cheap attempt at humour.

And then the hard art of fashioning an actual plot after the world-building is complete became a long, circuitous slog with nearly no payoff.The events leading up to and including the process by which Matt Damon's occupational therapist character finds himself alone in the downsized community suggest a fascinating plot ahead. And it never comes. Damon dates but that doesn't work out, he parties with his upstairs neighbor, finds himself working as a house cleaner after he becomes dissatisfied with a call center job. None of these threads is interesting and dialog as sparkling as tap water provides no help. The intriguing parts of the cast receive little screen time in favor of non-native English speaking actors whose accents are too impenetrable to be entertaining. The 2 hour, 15 minute run-time also does the movie no favors with long interstitial shots of scenery which worked effectively in ""The Descendants"" given it's more emotional and flat-out interesting subject matter. In short (get it?!), avoid.",Downsizing
93,LloydBayer,"While the satire hard to miss, Downsizing suffers from too many ideas confined to a small space.",4,17 January 2018,"For those unfamiliar with his body of work, Alexander Payne has made just six films, and as the writer/director, all these films are social satires penned with sharp wit. His social commentary is usually about mid-life crises, personal tragedy, dysfunctional relationships and pretty much life's difficult moments, which almost always lead to a breaking point that has the impacted character in a better or worse situation. This transformative period, which comes standard with dark humour, is usually the make or break point in Payne's films. Which is why Downsizing - in theory - is Payne's most ambitious film yet. The concept is brilliant, to say the least, and deals with multiple issues on a global scale - over consumption, global warming, prejudice, poverty, crime, and even the future of human existence. These are addressed very early in the film followed by an astounding solution. What if we could all live a very lavish life (think fully loaded eight bedroom mansion for life) for less than $60 a day, and in the process, eradicate all those aforementioned problems? The fix-it-all solution is a ground breaking discovery where humans are shrunk to 0.4 percent of the body mass, or about five inches tall. Although irreversible, the titular procedure is a huge success that gives rise to entire communities around the world, where each 'community' is roughly the size of a regular theme park. One pool party scene has a large group of 'small' people sharing a 'normal' sized bag of potato crisps. So instead of plundering resources that are already depleting at an alarming rate, downsizing requires only a tiny fraction of what we would normally consume in a day. In terms of numbers, that's almost a hundredth less of everything consumed, including trash and our carbon footprint. So when Matt Damon's therapist and wife (Kristen Wiig) are influenced by their small sized friend (Jason Sudeikis) to take the plunge, their savings of $150,000 nets them a whopping equivalent of $ 12 million, much more than required for some prime real estate at Leisureland, a downsized community. The downsizing segment is perhaps the best part of the film as it is funny and strange at the same time with creative attention to detail. At this point, Payne is clearly having fun with the story and the satire is unmissable - Size doesn't matter when you're rich. But there's trouble brewing in paradise. Soon after Damian's Paul is taken under the wing by his mysterious neighbour and party animal Dusan (a comfortably eccentric Christoph Waltz), the story takes a ninety degree turn with the arrival of a Vietnamese refugee (Hong Chau in her breakout role) in Leisureland. Although wonderfully played and through no fault of Ms Chau, her character becomes a mashup of several ideas Payne is playing with all at once. At first her accent seems genuinely funny, and then it lingers to a point of becoming exotic, all the while taking its toll on Paul, who now appears to have become a lost puppy. And then, out of nowhere, the film takes another turn and sprints towards an apocalyptic conclusion before offering a very unimaginative and thoroughly hackneyed ending. Yet much before we get to that ending, the inevitable question will be - what exactly is going on Mr Payne? Did we just sit through a film full of original ideas, only to watch those ideas shrink into thin air? Sadly, and after all this film has to say about the current state of socio-political and environmental issues, visual effects with convincing sense of scale, strong performances from the leads, Downsizing is equivalent to a marksman firing dead centre at a target, the bullet hitting the bullseye, but falling to the floor without penetrating. Not even a scratch.",Downsizing

This must be the reason the movie did not do so well, I think people were looking for The Incredible Shrinking Man again.It seems like just a comedy from the trailer but it's Alexander Payne, so you know it will be more introspective than most movies.

95,coreyjdenford,"Big ideas, left short",6,24 January 2018,"This review of Downsizing is spoiler free*** (3/5)ALEXANDER PAYNE IS a man of ideas both of big and small proportions, by looking at his brilliant filmography you would see that he's been at the helm of three great American road movies; Nebraska, About Schmidt and the Oscar winning Sideways. Essentially he's Ant-Man, a small man working in a big world - the world is his Oyster and he is the big shiny pearl at the center. On the subject of smell men working in a big world, his latest has moved away from the aforementioned sub-genre in Downsizing. Through the film the evidence of his big heart clearly shows, in large doses his brain is pulsating with big ideas, like a city for small people. In the end it all sounds clever but the result is an overly-ambitious endeavour that produces many big ideas that are sadly small in execution inevitably leaving it squashed. 
 
Matt Damon plays Paul Safronik a man working in a dead-end job, living with his wife Audrey (Wiig) in the same place where he grew up. They dream of moving up in the world, of having a better that's better for them in the long-run. So they decide to go under the completely irreversible process known as downsizing where people are shrunk to just 5 inches (12cm) tall. Here Payne introduces a stunning selection of images going through the extensive, painful looking procedure; he's shaved bald, his teeth are removed, he's put on a bed where he's then put into an industrial microwave (get it?) and he leaves at about the same size of a peanut. Then he's moved to a new dream-like mansion that looks like one of those very expensive dollhouses from Argos. And it's here where Payne's biggest ideas are unearthed he beautifully explores the city of Leisureland, a large city filled with dream-like manors, several fitness suites, pools, hotels etc. Complete with a dome-like net protecting the city from the bigger things outside. And the film looks dazzling while doing so thanks to breathtaking visuals and stunning cinematography making the town as beautiful as possible. 
 
There's a big heart, a big premise and some big talented names here such as Damon, Wiig, Christoph Waltz and Hong Chau working together at the helm producing brilliant performances. Sadly Downsizing's overly-ambitious exterior falls to Payne's editing techniques i.e. the pacing, at 2 hours and 15 minutes the story often feels stretched as Payne tends to linger on a couple of shots, granted they're stunning but they ultimately end up empty, which also impacts on the film's central heart. Sure this may pass through some thanks to Payne's hilarious light-hearted writing but to others the big premise isn't all it's cracked up to be. Still that said Payne's latest is a beautiful and ambitious idea that's filled with heart, packing heaps of hilarious light charm and hearty warmth.

96,jamiedarlow-37510,Not Alexander Payne's finest but an honourable effort,5,27 February 2020,"A brilliant premise and interesting setup leading to a sweetly done but strangely unsatisfying payoff. 'Downsizing' is a new medical phenomenon taking the world by storm in which by shrinking down a human being to 5 inches tall, all money troubles quickly dissolve and happiness is statistically increased. Paul and Audrey Safranek (Matt Damon and Kristen Wiig) decide to undertake this life changing procedure and the world very soon is seen through fresh eyes. It's the latest film by writer/director Alexander Payne (About Schmidt, The Descendants) who has produced great work and has brought a lot of ambition and good will here along with his frequent collaborator Jim Taylor. It's a script that is massive in scope and the film aims to balance many different philosophical points while also keeping its science-fiction theme in check but the philosophy and sentiment does take over; which wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing but it does lose the element that made this story so interesting in the first place and sadly the last third in particular becomes a bit full of itself and boring. It does still manage to have a sweet and good natured streak underneath it all though thanks to the relationships between the characters and I think that's what will keep a lot of viewers, including me, staying to the end. Performances are pretty great including a stand out one from Hong Chau. Overall, a bit of a disappointment but an honourable effort",Downsizing
97,Cinema_Fan,Ignorance is no excuse.,5,24 January 2018,"Downsizing is more of a film that centres on and around the concept of less-is-more, but a film that shows us that the pysical size is totally irrelevant to the fact that it is how much, as human beings, we are prepared to put into the world that we share. From the onset we are told that if we were to downsize not only would prosperity and happiness become an instant trait that would deliver direct economical and social benefits it would, in turn, save the world from implosion via the effects of global warming, pollution, overpopulation and indulgence. More to the point, the narrative here is a parallel universe that is simply a carbon copy of the larger world that some have chosen to readily except, and some to escape. The creation of downsizing, originally, was souly for the intention to benefit the planet and in turn to save the human race from its impending, and inevitable, doom. Human nature is never too far away.What is interesting here is that we quickly see that no matter what lies upon the new tiny surface we are still prone to social etiquette, a class system of rich & poor, haves and have-nots and with it a shallow and cold society that carries an air of material indifference rather than a union of a new Brotherhood and new world order. The dream is rather fleeting to those here who have to cook, clean and toil to survive in this decadent world. We see the hard-sell and in the background the hard reality of those who truly live it, truly experience it. This is very much a film that is pointing us in the direction of salvation, if we choose to take it, if we choose to see it; a warning shot over the bow, but still a choice. Wisdom over ignorance. Passion over apathy. Responsibility over indifference. Downsizing works on many levels, what with its message of the dying planet, its humanitarian slant and the unenlightened populace, all done with a serious, but dark comidec manner. But, the overall picture, the overall blame and the overall consequence has always been down to how we see and participate not only with the planet in which we cohabit but, too, and just as importantly, each other, as a human race.",Downsizing

It is about a man coping with the many changes in his life following his divorce (which takes place shortly after his downsizing) which includes being exposed to aspects of society of which he has no experience. Woven into this is an important warning about the dangers to our environment. Unfortunately the trailers for this film give a completely misleading impression of what type of movie it would be.

But wouldn't expect less from the creators!",7,4 February 2018,"Alexander Payne is known for intelligent and intriguing movies which reward patience and immersing oneself into the character's lives and personal journeys.His works may feel slow and relatively uneventful for some but offer memorable characters and excursions into modern life's uncomfortable shadow side - loss of purpose, search for redemption, loneliness, fitting in...The man also has a sharp sense of humor, mainly in the form of (social) satire, so if one prefers more mainstream or less biting humor, then his movies are probably not for one.""Downsizing"" is all that and more. The ""more"" part is down to the story being built on sci-fi-ish concept of the world fighting the overpopulation with making people literally smaller. They move into special communities where, due to consuming less, many more can enjoy the good luxurious life previously seen in movies and media.The main character (Matt Damon) decides to try that life, and finds that despite the wealthier lifestyle, the world hasn't really changed - and he still doesn't know what he's living for.Payne hasn't produced a script with his earlier constant writing partner Jim Taylor for a while now - they did ""Election"", ""About Schmidt"", and ""Sideways"" together.""Downsizing"" comes also from this fruitful era, the screenplay was ready in 2009, but Payne disregarded this for other new projects.I sure am glad that Payne has chosen to return to this story, for the result is more compact and exciting than the movies written without Taylor, such as ""The Descendants"" or ""Nebraska"".""Downsizing"" is unconventional even by Payne's standards, but it's also surprisingly mainstream-friendly, watchable both for the man's fans and those just for looking for entertainment.The relative general audience friendliness is a notable triumph for a project that could have ended as an obscure niche movie, even with the stars attached to it.There are many reasons the movie could have turned into a bit of a bore:* relatively slow tempo,* the author's usual somber topics of loneliness, seaching for purpose etc.,* the rather old-school approach when science fiction was a thinking person's movie genre, not for mainstream (the amazing people-shrinking-section even resembles the old movies' style visually),* quite a big reliance on social satire which is probably neither that interesting nor funny for general audience - topics such as white guilt, social inequality, modern human's selfishness and inability to see things in big picture,* unexpected and major tonal shift in the end which brings forth some obscure developments,* despite the very attractive trailer, ""Downsizing"" is actually more character- than event-based movie, so the makers have not felt the need to feed you ""interesting"" events or adventures just to keep you interestedLuckily, the characters and the performances are so colorful and relatable that it's a joy to watch.Damon plays the ""straight"" man clashing with other cultures and mindsets, but the people he meets are interesting on their own, well developed and sometimes bordering on tragicomical.The cast includes Kristen Wiig, Hong Chau, Christoph Waltz, Udo Kier, Rolf Lassgård, and some exciting guest parts from Jason Sudeikis, James Van Der Beek, Neil Patrick Harris, and Laura Dern.The actors have captured the weird and wonderful atmosphere of the story effectively - Payne has always been great ""actor's director"" - and there's lot to like about the performances.The best find is Hong Chau, an actress of of Vietnamese and Thaian background, who received Golden Globe nomination for her work.The human activist and peg-legged immigrant worker is already amazing and well-written character by herself, but Chau brings something unforgettable out of the material.There are different sides to her character - tough but tender, spontaneous and unexpected, bossy and vigorous - so it's a constant joy to watch what she does next. Not to mention her accent that makes her funny in a good way. Intentionally funny, I presume.Chau's charisma and screen presence are comparable to her two famous and distinguished co-stars, Damon and Waltz (who are really good too).But her's is an Oscar worthy performance - here's hope that she will not be excluded in nomination's list which will be made public soon.All in all, there's a lot to like about ""Downsizing"" but it's a difficult experience as well. Do not expect the same kind of experience as in trailers, the real movie can be slow and a bit depressing.It's not comedy in more conventional sense, but rather bizarre, disquieting and sad cautionary tale about where we are now - as species and as spiritual beings.Even many critics were not ready to truly appreciate Payne's newest awesomeness, but many of them will, after the second viewing, probably.",Downsizing
103,WalkdenEntertainment,Great Things Come In Small Packages...Not This Time,4,10 January 2019,"Paul (Matt Damon) is a kind hearted man. He works daily as an occupational therapist and comes home to his wife Audrey (Kristen Wiig). It's shortly mentioned that as a married couple, the two are struggling in life, particularly in regards to finances and overall happiness.In order to achieve their dreams in life (big house or a more suitable lifestyle), Paul and Audrey decide to undergo a procedure that will result in them being shrunk to the height of five inches tall. Paul and Audrey are not the 1st ones to venture into this new type of lifestyle known as Downsizing. In fact, Downsizing has been becoming rather popular, as it has been proven to be more beneficial for the world's environment.If you've seen the film's trailer, forget them. I feel as though the marketing for this film is sadly misleading as to what the film's actual plot is truly about. The trailer would lead you think this is a comedy. In fact, it's more of a depressing drama...As the film Downsizing begins, we understand the process and lifestyle of it all, but after this introduction, I found the film became completely different and continued to change the plot's theme over and over again with multiple sub- plots. At times, after I became invested in a sub-plot, the film would suddenly change paths yet again. I also found myself forgetting what I was actually watching because of this. As a story, the movie is confusing, random and slow paced. Granted, the 1st 20mins is genuinely what I was expecting based on the film's trailers and marketing. Not only this, but multiple times throughout the film, you will even forget that these characters are actually Downsized, because many of the film's shots appear normal. This meant the film missed many fun and creative opportunities it could of had.Matt Damon once again delivers a character that is gentle and kind-hearted to others around him, but is this a role for Matt Damon that is new or pushing his limits as an actor? Sadly, not really. And the worst part is, his character is rather depressing to watch. Other characters surrounding Matt Damon are forgettable and at times can be somewhat annoying and cheesy.Overall, this is a film that has far too many elements crammed into one film. As the audience, we see the film begin with a pleasant introduction but sadly move on and take a completely different direction over and over again. No matter happens here, Downsized is dull, odd and uninteresting. Characters here are also forgettable. I'm left overall feeling shocked and saddened by what could have been.3.8/10

106,dallasryan,The Overall Concept is Pure,7,6 January 2018,"I always like Alexander Payne movies. He always has the self-referential humor in his films that I love and Downsizing has plenty of that humor as well. Downsizing isn't Payne's best and the viewer will have to let their suspension of disbelief go out the window on this one because even if something like this were ever possible, nothing could be ready in 5 to 10 years, it would be more like 50 to 100 years, if that. But the acting is great, the comedy is funny, and the overall concept is pure. Matt Damon's character is able to have financial freedom when he downsizes ergo he meets Hong Chau's character (she is fantastic in this), and Damon's character learns a powerful lesson from her. Chau's character has downsized yet she still has to work full time, live in the slums and she still finds time to help people everyday. Damon's character helped his mom, and felt he missed his calling-his purpose, his character helped people as far as his job went when he was in the normal size world, but when Damon has financial freedom from downsizing he learns that he wants to help people even without it being a job. And for a while Damon wants to help all of mankind, on a monumental scale and maybe be famous from it, but Chau's character shows and tells him he can help right here, right now on a smaller scale, even if it is thankless and he doesn't become remembered for it. Just to help people selflessly as he has always done before. Damon learns all this from her, and that's really the overall message. What would you do if you had financial freedom?

So what's this film all about, other than 'save the planet and its natural resources by making yourself tiny thus consuming less'? And of course you stand to get rich in the process. If this were a 70's movie, the company behind the process would be a shady, billion-dollar scam and our hero Paul (Damon) would be on the run while trying to expose it all, but that's not the case here - what we seem to get is the juxtaposition of those who would shut themselves away in order to survive versus those who remain behind to help those who cannot help themselves. Which is pleasant enough I suppose, but there's no 'big moment' when all becomes clear and you suddenly see what's going on, because (AFAICS) there really isn't anything going on apart from Paul's journey from an ordinary American man who cares mostly about money and lifestyle to a far more caring person who genuinely wishes to improve the lives of others.

119,hunter-friesen,The trailers bait and switch you into this overlong and boring mess,5,18 March 2018,"Alexander Payne's Downsizing looked like a promising film when it premiered at Venice in September 2017. It had an interesting ""What if"" premise about shrinking the world's population down. Unfortunately, this premise is barely touched on and ditched within thirty minutes, leaving us with 110 minutes of a boring Matt Damon being enlightened the most annoying way possible. Downsizing wants to be many different things, but it couldn't even do the most important thing right: be interesting. Set in the modern day, the film follows Matt Damon and Kristen Wiig as Paul and Audrey Safranek. They're a middle-class couple that needs something new to happen in their lives. News breaks out of a Swedish procedure called ""Downsizing"" that shrinks people down to 5"" tall. The purpose of the procedure is to eliminate human waste on the planet and protect the environment. Paul goes for the experiment, not for the environment, but for the luxury small people live in since everything costs so little. Audrey backs out in fear, leaving Paul to fend for himself in a new world. Based on the description I just gave, the film sounds pretty interesting to watch and think about. But, like I said before, the shrunken people story is only central in the first half hour. After that, we get bombarded with themes of environmentalism and materialism. Now we have a film that is trying to send multiple messages at once. None of them mesh together well as the writers, Alexander Payne and Jim Taylor, have each fight the other to see who becomes the main theme. The film also suffers from being slow and boring. It takes close to forty-five minutes for Matt Damon to be shrunk, and then another half hour as we are given a middling tour of small America. Payne, the director as well, also takes too long to introduce our unspecial supporting characters. Christoph Waltz appears as Dusan Mirkovic, a Frenchman who shrunk himself to live the high life of partying and women. Hong Chau appears as Ngoc Lan Tran, a Vietnamese cleaning lady for Dusan who shrunk to escape the tyranny going on in her home country. This felt like Alexander Payne trying to give society a lesson on selfishness. Payne has subplots that indulge in helping the less privileged, protecting the environment for the future, and being happy with what we have. It's very preachy and by the end of it, I just wanted it to stop, mostly because nothing about it was interesting or original.Aligning with the same quality of the rest of the film is the actors. Everyone except Hong Chau gives lackluster performances. Matt Damon is the least compelling as the ""Everyman"" character as we watch the film from his point of view. Paul is a boring and self-centered man that carries no interesting or desirable traits. About every other side character is more interesting to watch than him, and about every other actor does a better job than Damon. I'm not saying that Christoph Waltz or Kristen Wiig did a good job because they didn't, I'm saying they did a less poor job. Waltz does his usual gimmick of being the eccentric European who talks a little differently. He's done it countless times and its worked wonders before, but here it's unwelcome and annoying. Wiig gets caught playing too straight here as her comedic capabilities are left untapped. The one decent thing you can pick from this film is Hong Chau. She's bold in her role and steals the show from Damon, who she's constantly paired up with. Her character is a saint to the less fortunate shrunken people, bringing them food and tending to their physical ailments.I would like to congratulate the marketing team behind Downsizing for selling this film to me so well. If they had shown me snapshots from the entire film, I would have never seen it. I was baited and switched, but only after I had given them my money.

It is something new for them, since their previous flicks have mostly been grounded in middle class American reality. This begins very much that way but eventually spins off in a completely unexpected direction, and ends up someplace unique.The premise is interesting - imagine a technology that allows people to shrink themselves down to a fraction of normal size. What would humanity do with that? Well, use it to stretch the family budget and retire to gated communities and lives of leisure, of course! Your dollar buys a lot more when you are 5 inches tall. Alas, the same problems that plague the regular world (e.g. Poverty and illness) reappear in this one. An impending environmental disaster rears up, and our average guy hero (well played by Damon as always) ends up heading off to Norway and an encounter with the second coming of Noah's ark.The visual effects are very interesting, but some of the characters are not exactly a pleasure to spend time with.

A lot!Kristen Wiig is in this film too, and Jason Suedeikis, and others. But you'd barely know it, because they are in the film for about 3-5 minutes each, total. Obvious cast padding.
Beyond those minor annoyances, once we get to the meat of the plot I enjoyed the film, briefly.
The whole shrinking process was kind of cool / funny, along with seeing Leisureland for the first time, but as the story shifts to life as small, it starts to feel more like a bland, normal plot line.See, there seem to be oppressed minorities in this small world, for seemingly no reason, and Matt's character gets paired up with a Vietnamese woman in some of the worst romantic casting in a film, ever.Seriously, no one, not even the characters themselves, would put each other together, but every film has to be everything to everyone nowadays, so we get a nice, incredibly forced romance shoved into our faces right near the climax of the film, and it completely destroys any momentum, due to its absurdity.Speaking of the climax, like most aspects of this film, major plot lines are introduced, then quickly forgotten. For one thing, the protagonist sure forgets he ever had a wife in about 3 seconds, and late in the film the fact that the world is nearing its end is dramatically introduced, then quickly discarded again.
Sure, the world might be about to end, but our ""hero"" decides maybe he can spend a few decades fixing wooden legs, before he chokes to death on pollution.Happy ending?",Downsizing

Good times!,4,31 March 2018,"Matt Damon-the human embodiment of white bread-mugs his way through this awkward box office bomb that doesn't know where it's going, and has several conflicting ideas about how to get there. He is supported by Hong Chau (reduced to a painfully outdated racial stereotype, complete with excruciatingly affected accent and an insultingly limited 'me love you long time' vocabulary) and the irrepressible Christoph Waltz (a classy Austrian playing a filthy Serb) who steals the show in every one of his scenes, and is easily the most likeable and relatable character.The film starts off as a social commentary on over-consumption, and attempts to follow this through into the 'downsized' world, but doesn't seem to know what's mean to happen next, and takes several sharp turns in unrelated directions as it tries to re-establish what might be generously described as the vaguely salvageable remnants of an otherwise incoherent plot.The third act informs us that the Antarctic ice caps are releasing too much methane so of course, tough decisions need to be made. A tiny handful of sensible people respond accordingly, while the rest of the world (including Damon and his 2-dimensional mail order Vietnamese girlfriend) just continues on its merry way as if nothing has changed.And then the movie ends.I rate Downsizing at 13.32 on the Haglee Scale, which works out as a shockingly racist 4/10 on IMDB.",Downsizing
128,hjalsayegh,Too slow and rather empty,5,20 January 2018,"'If you don't turn your life into a story, you just become a part of someone else's story.' Terry PratchettSometimes when you read a book the main character is left a bit blank so you could insert yourself into the tale. This happens in this movie, It's attempting to be an Alice in wonderland but with a miniaturization concept.What actually happens is that the main character (played by Matt Damon) ends up as a drifter. Someone that has no life or choices of his own and instead just follows others or sees how wind is blowing at that particular point in time resulting in a slow and rather dull movie. The sound track actually added to this. looking at a screen that is nothing but white, people doing nothing and soothing music just made me sleepy. The sad part is, This would have been ten times better if they decided to commit and follow any of the other characters. They were all given a very distinct personality and life. Why not let us see this tiny world from their eyes? Even the ending left you with the feeling of something incomplete as Matt Damon is still not making his own choices, just following someone else around. Trying to be a part of someone else's story.This movie got an extra two stars for the amazing Hong Chau, she gave a great performance and I just couldn't help but wonder why we had to wait to the second half of the movie to follow her around. Her character is interesting, motivated and very expressive.",Downsizing
129,justinwfirestone,Not very fun or insightful,5,5 January 2018,"It would be easy to make a joke, like: ""Let's get small. I mean it. Let's shrink and be small.""Despite leaving your brain at the door, which might facilitate a deeper understanding of how those little people would have been squashed like bugs by a bug, or sliced apart by the metal spatulas used to scoop them off medical gurneys, it is very difficult to avoid wondering about the physics of getting small. It's even enough to keep you from wondering whether Christoph Waltz will get cast as a normie anytime soon.This all ruins the point of the movie, of course, which is to posit that humanity will never change, even if we get small, because we come with innate flaws like conspicuous consumption, even though some of us can live together in harmony, but only if it's in a cult with a strong leader. Or maybe the point of the movie is that no matter what humans do, and no matter how innovative we become, no matter how much science we can science, we are all going to die, probably sooner than later, and generally for the best.With nearly eight billion of us stinking up the planet, the message from Downsizing is muddled with unfinished threads, like run-on sentences, nothing satisfying about how any of it might or could end.",Downsizing

132,intrepidami,What a mess!,3,25 December 2017,"OK so the previews see a fun movie about people shrinking and adventures that ensue? Instead we see a pretty depressing movie about a poor sap who has no idea how to stand up to women who are walking all over him. Guy's like this who try too hard and throw themselves desperately out there might as well have a neon light that flashes sucker over their heads. At first it's his mom, suddenly she's gone and it's his wife, we're quickly shown how she's trying to drain him financially, and then the alleged plot about down sizing kicks in briefly. Of course she let's him go through with the procedure and leaves him tiny, and alone. Within 5 minutes she also divorces him and drains him in the divorce.There's a brief set up scene TO HAMMER HOME HE'S A SAP where he rushes a date into meeting her kid the woman of course says it's too soon. Within five minutes he meets the woman who will cartoonishly use him the rest of the movie.However, there is a plot twist! She treats him like dirt, orders him around endlessly, and verbally abuses him constantly...yet she's somehow a wonderful saintly women???Then there's a scene where she falls asleep and he kisses her without consent?

133,Richard_Alex_Jenkins,Not quite comedy gold but still worth the trouble,7,4 April 2021,"I watched the credits all the way through while enjoying the lovely music and trying to summarize the experience: bizarre, although not quite top-notch material.Like many people, I suppose, I thought this was going to be a novel twist on the apocalyptic moment of going into space to seek a new world because the one we live in is no longer viable, which the movie was in an overly nice and almost TV-special kind of way for the first hour. Nothing very surprising and it was far too sanitizing and decent for my tastes (actually quite boring).Until things gradually take a turn into the bizarre, and definitely for the better! Although Downsizing failed to tug on my heart strings in the way I think the producers were hoping for, the change in focus was really welcome and almost sinister, somehow able to completely turn tasteful utopia into a not so agreeable dystopia in which everything we strive to rise above through material gain in the real world is spookily mirrored in the brave new world: the same degree of corruption and power, countered by humility and poverty on the other side of the fence.Although the moral aspects of human society aren't properly fleshed out in Downsizing, the way the movie becomes dark and adult through the introduction of new characters helps to make a rather average movie turn into something harder to grasp or define, especially through the comedy aspect of the strangely compelling three-legged Vietnamese activist and the European nightclubbin' high society in the apartment just above.Actually, much of Downsizing fails to spark into real life or gel in a cohesive or interesting enough manner, but I enjoyed having my mind sent out on a tangent instead of remaining in a closed loop of moderate content or boredom.",Downsizing
134,bernie-122,Ignore the other reviews,6,18 March 2018,"This marks the end of my reliance on amateur movie reviewers in making a decision about whether or not to watch any given movie. Because of them, I almost didn't watch this one. I will say this: Ignore everyone who bagged this film. They don't know what they're talking about. After reading endless 1-star reviews, and even some 9- or-10 star ones, I see that none of them got it right. Of the bad things I might say about this film, the worst would be that the science is just terrible. I don't blame this on the filmmakers directly, rather on the average american being so ignorant of things scientific that the makers know they can get away with almost anything. In large part, I can live with this. The requirement to suspend disbelief is very common for moviegoers, and for a lot of reasons. But, when it comes to science, it is different. A lot of us know pretty much what is possible and what is not. The science in this film failed when it came to scaling everyday big-people's objects to the small world. It just doesn't work. The small world looked just like ours. In order to have fridges, ovens, toasters, televisions, etc. that look exactly like the ones we have, there would have to be massive miniature factories with hordes of miniature robots building these devices from impossibly tiny components. A whole manufacturing economy would have to be in place. I saw no evidence of this. All the little peoples' needs appeared to be provided by big people. None of the reviews I read noted that a shrunken person would necessarily have a very high, squeaky voice. They all sounded exactly like lower-volume big people. Of course, that would ruin the whole film, so best to just ignore it.Nowhere in the film did I see any reference to shrinking any beings other than humans. Yet, in Norway, we see horses, sheep, dogs, all suitably miniaturized. The first thing that struck me when I saw the miniature yacht in the Norwegian fjord was that the thing was only about 3 feet long at most; the fjord was glassy smooth, but I'm quite sure they're not always like that. The weather can get very nasty, and if it did, a 3-foot boat would have no chance at all.Leaving all that aside, things really weren't that bad until the silly climate lectures started, and it really fell apart with the methane revelation. Talk about bad science! And if the earth did get enveloped in the biggest methane bubble that it could produce, would it really take 8,000 years to get over it? I kinda doubt it.Much has been said about the nonsense of Mrs. Safranek getting cold feet at the last minute and bailing out of the whole thing. It almost looks to me as if they had already partly shot the film and she needed to be hastily written out of it, for reasons we wil never be party to. That would be consistent with her sudden disappearance. Then again, it would make sense to shoot the scenes of the actual shrinking at the very last, because they involve shaving everybody's hair and eyebrows off. It wouldn't do to have to wait for Matt's hair to grow back.Anyway, the science of the shrinking process isn't much better than the rest. But, so what? Is it a good watch? Yes, up until the last half hour, when the wheels fell off. So, I suppose it could be recommended, with the warning to disregard the silly ending, but you'd realize that, anyway, albeit too late. But I wouldn't spend a lot of money on it. As for the satire, I didn't see any. At least, not the American kind, where they rub your face in it to make sure you got it. But I didn't see the other kind of satire, either. Not much of any kind of humor.Finally, I would say that this isn't really Matt Damon's kind of film, so I don't know why he did it. Needed the money, perhaps. Not that he didn't do alright with what there was to work with. I'll give it a 6.",Downsizing
135,rmarkd,One more type of f--- I can think of. Waste of my f___ing time,3,29 June 2020,"There's a scene in this movie where the girl says there are 8 types of f___. I thought of a ninth. Granted, it's not the same thing (and, admittedly, it's a nice line), but this movie was a waste.It had such a great concept. Matt Damon plays Paul Safranek and Kristen Wiig plays his wife Audrey. In this universe, people have developed a way to shrink people down to 5 inches (freedom units!). Paul goes but Audrey has a last minute change of mind. The process is irreversible. Cool! What they could have done:*Follow Paul as he learns to deal with his new bachelor life in the mini-world and a wife who is hesitant to go. Maybe they end up together, maybe he realizes they weren't meant to be.
*Movie about how things seem better mini-sized, but really aren't.
*Social commentary on how, even in a world where you're apparently 100x richer, inequality creeps in
*Fun comedy about living in a small world (80's kids remember The Littles)Instead, we get a movie that starts off as a comedy, but ends up being a social commentary but doesn't do either of them very well. Actually, the comedy was working, but the social commentary was pointless and stupid. It was a classic bait and switch movie, with the switch being awful.The social commentary portion of the movie isn't well established. Yes, there are some throwaway lines about how people are being forced into the mini world, but it's never developed. We don't see how or why this happened, which would have been an interesting concept, but they didn't do that at all. We just got thrown into it. The movie took an interesting concept, then did nothing with it for the other 3/4 of the movie. And the 3/4 of the movie they did focus on carried absolutely no weight.Now for some social commentary ranting. I gave my 3/10 rating before stewing on these thoughts, so I'd like to think this was outside of my dislike for the movie:
So yeah, in this world, everything seems to be great except if you're brown (Latino, Vietnamese, etc.). Didn't see any poor white people, so I guess this movie is saying white people won't take advantage of each other that way, only the non-whites would put each other in poverty situations. And there are poor white people. In this world though, they're all rich, or living in harmony with the token non-whites. As a non-white myself, I get sick of these universes.There are, of course, the kind rich people who help these mini-poor by giving them their leftovers. So nice! Hey, I'm going to throw this away anyway and it's probably old, so let's just give it to the poor and I have more room in the trash.
end of rant.Bottom line, this movie had such a great concept, went nowhere with it and decided to bash us over the head with ""poverty exists"" and an even stupider subplot of ""this group thinks the world is going to end in a few hundred years, so let's lock ourselves in a mountain *now*"". And while that alone is a bait and switch, I might have been okay with it if they made some sort of point and somehow connected it with the downsizing concept, but they didn't. Just a complete waste of something that could have been so good. 3/10.",Downsizing

139,AJ4F,"They should have strengthened the environmental theme, or made it a comedy",6,23 June 2018,"The overpopulation message was well stated at the outset and they could have gone where few movies dare to, but it digressed into an implausible solution with meandering story-lines.The fundamental concept of shrinking people that small seems ridiculous and physically unworkable. Who would truly want to become so fragile and be forced to live out of proportion to the rest of the world? The wife who bailed seemed like the only sane character. Too many technical aspects went unexplained. How did they deal with things like the surface tension of water and the relative damage it does to small objects (the nets created torrents of it), plus scaling down food for digestibility and intricacies of building machinery at a watchmaker's scale?The shrunk guy who first gave Damon advice annoyed me with his glib comment about the environment, as did the noisy neighbor, played by an actor who specializes in deception. The Vietnamese lady came across as shrill and unlikable, though portrayed as a sympathetic figure. I found that subplot largely unnecessary, but it was probably meant to show that being small doesn't solve fundamental problems of wealth and class.Hollywood often delves into environmental themes but doesn't take them far enough, loading them up with public apathy. The plight of nature often becomes a backdrop to human interest stories, e.g. the infamous ""Deliverance"" scene overshadowing the loss of a major river. Another 1972 movie, ""Z.P.G."" missed a similar chance, focusing instead on rebels against a sound concept. The theme tends to be that some people are wise and recognize Earth's limits but it's ""unfair"" to ask the rest to care because they have ""lives to lead.""I think this movie tried to do too many things with wandering subplots. I'd have rather seen it as a dark comedy that treated smallness as a fantasy, or a film devoted entirely to Earth's carrying capacity with a more practical means of reducing our footprint (like a pill that creates personal restraint). ""Soylent Green"" was one of the few films that actually faced the music. It's far more plausible to recycle people than to shrink them!",Downsizing

With the content they had, they could have split the movie in half and made them into 2 separate movies.

141,eve_dolluk,Excellent funsized Drama about humanity and planet Earth,7,1 January 2018,"This is a well put together Drama, its not a comedy. I was expecting a comedy but it like to say that this Is not a comedy although it does have a few quirky moments. To prevent the huge amounts of pollution and global warming as well as other human made world problems a scientist comes up with a way to make people small. This enables less waste and usage which in turn will help save the planet and also prevent human extinction. Its pure Sci Fi of course except the human extinction and environment issues which are all there in science fact. Once we get away from the environment issues there is also the human element and where we see they highlight society in this small world where it would seem its not as perfect as its made out to be. Poor people still exist in the small world and capitalism is still high on the agenda. There is some good performances, Weiss plays a smarmy guy looking to capitalise on this new small world. Matt Damon plays the guy who always makes a mess of things and believes that downsizing will sort out his problems. The rest of the cast has much smaller roles with little screen time but the stand out performance here is Hong Chau who plays a Vietnamese immigrant who find her self struggling in the new small world after losing a leg. Her abrupt nature and pure honesty is refreshing to see on the big screen. This is definitely a film that Yanks will hate as they all seem to live in this bubble and believe that they can carry on like they have for the past 100 years forever. The realities is different and it is now said that we have gone past the point of no return. This film is a little preachy but maybe that is needed ?? Otherwise its a solid film and quite heart warming with romance elements that focus on more than just materialistic asthetics.

To me it was the most disappointing film of 2017 and having given it a second chance just now my opinion hasn't changed.

Because small people takes up less space, eat less food and need less money to get by. For them 1 dollar is the same than 1000 dollars. The procedure is however irreversible.

Here he makes new friends and find new love in the very annoying Vietnamese woman Ngoc Lan Tran, played by the appaerently american actress Hong Shau.The whole idea of being downsized is ridiculous and would have worked as a very dark comedy. Instead it tries to be this big intellectual drame disguised as a scifi movie. And its very boring and very long.I don't know if the message is that even if people are downsized, they are still a-holes. And the problems they try to escape, by downsizing don't go away, just because they become small.Either way, this is a typical Matt Damon movie. Had it been a dark comedy, Matt Damon wouldn't have done it. Because for some reason this discount version of Tom Hanks, will only do these types of movies. Maybe he still hopes to win another Oscar or maybe he thinks he's a shakespearian actor. Matt Damon is not a shakespearian actor however.

I can remember one movie that had a funny great trailer.. and the end result (""end"" because I didn't see it to the end) in a super lame and cringy movie. They used Jennifer Aniston.But I like Mat Damon.. ok. Let's keep watching because while I'm at, I'm embroidering, so I won't be as boring as many here...It was surprising that his wife left him... but in the end, I didn't like it. It sounded like movie makers do in horror movies when they want you to scare you. It is cheap.
In this case, I didn't expected that, but either way, I didn't feel that they were a couple.. the characters didn't have chemistry between them... so it was almost like a couple that they just met and decided to do the downsize together but she cheated on him, leaving without telling, which is more believable than a married couple.. so, it had some kind of impact, but not enough.Mat Damon character was too mellow, a pushover. It would have been better to be more strong.
The Vietnamese woman.. was super annoying. Hated her st*pid voice all along the movie. And I don't know how someone living in the middle of a vietnamese jungle can speak english.And talking about other nationalities, does the US citizens think every foreign in US is mexican?? really?? Every time....
And of course, every non US citizen lives in a poor place, and clean houses!! don't forget.
I say ""US citizen"" because I don't call them ""Americans"" because those are the one living in the American Continent. In my country we call them ""estadounidenses"" (for ""United States"")
And I could go on on the stereotypes...I kept watching the movie because it was on Netflix, inertia, and Mat Damon. My stars are for him.Some said here that had a premise about how the human beigns are ruining the earth but end up betraying that.. I think It was on purpose. That may be the message.
New agenda: pollution, end of the world, too much people in this world.. I think the solution could be that the ones that hold the power in this world that are just a few die, and then, countries like mine would live free without corruption.

With that being said, he encounters relationship problems, new faces and even a Vietnamese celebrity.Despite the mixed reviews I was kind of interested in this film because I found the concept very interesting as the idea of shrinking a person down for the benefit of the environment. I'm majoring in environmental studies and just like with film, the environment really interests me. With this, we do get some nice shots of the environment during the third act. The actors really try with the script given to them, which brings off some interesting chemistry. Matt Damon was great in this movie as well as Hong Chau and Kristen Wiig. Again, the big strength of this movie is the idea of shrinking down to benefit the environment.In spite of this, the execution could've been a lot better. The second act especially proves this to a t. The second act of this movie was nothing short of a jumbled up mess. I won't spoil any events, but there is one event in the beginning that feels pointless and tries to force an emotion out of its viewer. Directly afterwards, there is a small subplot that becomes irrelevant by the third act. As one last example, there is a party scene that just dragged. Even at that, I wish they would've given more focus onto Earth as it is more scaled down for those that were downsized. Instead, most of the movie takes place in a small, scaled-to-size city. If anything, something like A Bug's Life, even 20 years later, has more to offer with its visuals of a scaled down world than this movie does.Downsizing manages to take a brilliant concept and execute it fairly poorly.

It's interesting how even in the movie it doesn't provide the ultimate solution, perhaps because the chief motivation for doing it is selfish, to provide material luxuries inaccessible in one's ""big"" life, rather than an altruistic desire to save the environment. When the Antarctic methane burst brings the end of the world near, only 3 % of the world has chosen to downsize.I thought the way ""downsizing"" was implemented was realistic in timescale and detail - good old-fashioned real-estate project villages, spreading slowly across the globe, as would have to be the case due to the ""no going back"" nature of the process and the personal commitment required. I liked the attention to detail: When a couple of proponents are introduced to an audience in their small case, they are standing up holding onto vertical rails like you do in a bus, though this is only seen from a distance. The implementation of LeisureLand with its giant net to exclude weather and insects is a thoughtful and essential touch, though in reality the worst thing to fear would be some big person running amok and trying to destroy a small village through some irrational motivation which seems to readily grip humans.So far so good, but it's the second part of the movie which many seem to be put off by. Hong Chou's character is no doubt meant to be humorous though I found her voice and manner irritating. A meaningful relation should involve both parties supporting and respecting one another, not seeking to dominate (however subtly - though HC is not at all subtle) or ""boss"", even for good causes. It's funny to see Paul - aka Jason Bourne - acquiesce so meekly.The ""cult"" going down the hole to a sequestered world where they can ride-out a coming catastrophe is not without potential problems, but the motivation and the reasoning is clear and sound. The world might not end for a few centuries due to climate change (we wish), but it could be over in less than an afternoon if a full blown nuclear war were to erupt. I cannot but feel that most people have forgotten the nuclear Damoclean sword hanging over our heads. Likewise if a rogue AI were to takeover - I know many feel this is impossible - it would be took late to seek cover. The wannacry virus which crippled the UK health service about a year ago was a faint precursor of what might happen. That was just some dumb robot seeking to encrypt as many computers as possible, but what if it advanced to be much more directed - shutdown human society, power stations, banking, all communication - for the ultimate good of ""reforming"" humanity? Such a being would act at lightning speed and essentially be immortal.Anyway these are just a few random thoughts on a movie which will probably remain unique...Only people ""down the hole"" or perhaps on Mars as Elon Musk is attempting to get-up, would conceivably be safe.",Downsizing

As in this movie, the ""poor people"" are always non-white so there's clearly a subtext here. I unabashedly would prefer to live in a nice clean home so I must be one of the evil overlords.

153,ElliesWonder,Dark Humor,7,6 April 2018,"Might contain personal over interpreting.This is not a Sci-Fi movie, the science downsizing is just an outerwear. It is about life choices, social phenomenon, and of course, some drama is needed. It classified as Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi, in fact, the movie is not funny nor entertaining, it is quite dark humor.What is the movie about 
Scientists developed a new technology that can transform many living things into small sizes, to help global overpopulation issues. This is a one-way transform, after a painless surgery, human will convert to only 5"" small. Small people require less land and necessity to live, money becomes valuable, like a mansion, that is only a dollhouse-size in big guy's world. After 10 years development, there is 3% of the world population had practiced in this transform. Matt Damon casts a middle age guy named Paul, has a little saving, he decided to downsize with his wife to have a better life that can enormously reduce their cost of living. Unfortunately, the wife regretted and the downsizing transform is permanent. Paul needed to live alone in the small world.Sonn after, Paul became a phone customer service in the small world. This part is one of the interesting screens for me because I thought people will become generous when they are rich. Like the nurse and lead guy that bought Paul out of the hospital, they all very friendly. I thought the small world is a utopian city, zero crime, no works needed, everybody is having a party. People still work because they like to help and feel needed. HOWEVER, when I recalled this details later, I found Paul was forced to work because he is poor. His divorce property was divided and had no money, and his medical license is expired. Paul thought he could change everything by downsizing, unfortunately, nothing change, and the situation even get worse.What I think about this movie:
This story is more about middle age crisis and the unrealistic utopia world. People spent their saving to buy a ticket to the small land. Yet, rich still rich, poor remain poor, this utopian world does not exist when the poor Vietnam girl shows up, it brings us the view of the poor world. It sent out the message that poor exist everywhere, they leave in the corner where many people won't see. They are ignorant, rude and not living decently, but they also have an honorable kind heart.The Vietnam girl is a humorous character, yet the scriptwriter put a lot of stereotypes and political correct concept into this character, they made her so contradictory. She was persecuted politically and abused into small size; speaks terrible English, never smile, never says thank you to Paul, and acts like she desired all the help. But on the other side, she lives independently, not willing to live w foster families, and always helping around in her poor community. That is so contradictory, I can't believe a girl who has a kind heart would have such ungrateful attitude, isn't the scriptwriter wanted to show us a dramatic contrast? That is too stiff.Lastly, the main character, Paul, a mid-age greasy doormat, that even a single mom doesn't want to date him. He is not old, but he is boring, 'he laughed outside, but he is pathetic inside,' just like many adulthood is like. Hence Paul wants to live like others, like Dusan's business experience, the Vietnam girl's volunteering, and the Doctor's human survival plan experience. He wished he can have a different life because he wants to live meaningfully. In fact, that is his self-comfort, just like the Vietnam girl said, he is crazy to not living in present, but daydreaming a better world.This is not a thrilling sci-fi story, and I don't even see the global warming concerns a lot. This is just a life choice of a middle-aged ordinary man, an Alice's wonderland talks about real life conflicts. Many might not like it, to me, fair to middling, not bad.",Downsizing

It takes a pretty deft film director to relay these themes with comedy. Matt Damon is excellent as this hapless fellow aimlessly wandering through life until he meets Hong Chau's lovable character.

RomCom drama lacking romance, comedy and drama(as well as chemistry between the leads).What works at least a bit-The leads played their parts well enough.Cinematography and special effects were passable.What doesn't-Pacing is horrible. Not sure if this is more a poor job of directing or editing. In either case they should cut an hour or so of snoozefest.Writing for the most part is subpar(though there is a mildly memorable moment here and there).Included with your Hulu subscription and still a bit overpriced.

Global warming alarmist movie. This movie pulls an Al Gore and tells you that the earth is going to be underwater in a few years. Time and history have shown this is not true. Ice caps are melting in some places, yes, but they're also growing in other areas. I'm not denying a certain man-made aspect, but this movie goes over the top. The ""overpopulation"" is a global crisis shtick is brought out... Nevermind that Nazis and Stalinists used that as an excuse for eugenics to kill millions of people. Apparently, minorities are not allowed in leisureland, especially Mexicans. Only rich, white men are allowed in leisureland. How many stereotypes can this movie play on? Ridiculous.

And the editing leaves you wondering who or why parts of the movie weren't edited out completely or edited to build the story line in a clear direction. Damon's acting was great.. no problem.. as well as some of the supporting cast. But it simply seems like the editing, script and directing left these actors thinking that somewhere it would all be put together to make a great movie.

Then it dramatically shifted to how the world was going to end because of methane gas melting the polar ice caps. But the end does not come.

At the beginning I realized there was an environmental theme to this; thought I'd enjoy it more because of that. Boy was I wrong, this was not about shrinking or the environment... By the last 80 minutes I had no idea what direction this movie was taking. I believe had this film stuck more to the environmental theme or had it taken a deeper look at how human didn't change despite their size it would've been more resolved. The relationship between Paul and the maid was not believable and was extremely quick paced. The ending made no sense to me either;what was the point of Waltz, Paul and the other guy (forgot his name) going to Norway? They didn't join them in the underground ""Arch"" so why were they there? They talked about the world ending, yet nothing happened.

166,sildarmillion,This movie has an identity crisis,8,18 May 2020,"This movie has an identity crisis, but I did actually really like what it had to say. In some ways, it's understandable why it was poorly received. This concept has great potential in many different directions, but the movie doesn't go in any of those directions.The movie has a sci-fi premise and a comedy marketing campaign. But it is neither of those things, thus the movie's marketing mismanaged audience expectations. The movie also only lightly brushes over the many many many implications of downsizing (social, economic, geopolitical, etc.), which probably left many viewers dissatisfied. This movie is mostly a social satire, but even then, it could have pursued the satire from many different angles, but goes for an angle that probably didn't fly with many people.It did fly with me though. See, the movie is a critique of the American suburban ideal. American suburbanites are portrayed as basically small-minded self-obsessed folks whose aspirations involve living in oblivious luxury. Downsizing to them isn't about saving the world, (although they constantly remind themselves that it is helping the world to make themselves feel better), it's about living a life of wealth and luxury and leisure. And they turn a blind eye to the exploitation that happens in order for them to have this life.Paul is a great example of them. He is basically a nice guy with a good heart, but his world in suburban Omaha is rather small and his aspirations are similarly small, and thus when he does get small, he is left feeling empty. His encounter with Ngoc Lan only goes to show how small Paul's world really is and how much he really struggles to see beyond it. I was afraid there would be a forced romance between the two, but while they do get together, it's not really a romance, and it's not forced. By that I mean, it wasn't sentimental. They're not really a well-matched couple, but Ngoc Lan would give Paul an opportunity to start to grow his horizons and find purpose in the world by giving back. And Ngoc Lan, well, I guess she does deserve to be with someone who helps and supports her even if he isn't philosophically compatible with her. Anyways, Paul is such a blank slate, it doesn't matter. He basically goes on to adopt her outlook on life.There is a little bit of critique of Europeans too, specifically the Scandinavian colony. Maybe they are stereotyped somewhat by showing them to be hippies more focused on saving the planet and human race but in a very idealistic way. While they're more aware of their human condition and their place in the larger question of existence, at the same time, they don't seem to be the ideal community either - as Dusan notes, they're kind of a cult.Then there are Dusan and Konrad of course, who are critiques of opportunists who take advantage of the Americans' obliviousness and the Scandinavian's' idealism. They exploit the world, but do it with their eyes wide open.Finally, there is Ngoc Lan. She could have easily been a severely annoying character with her saint complex. But it works, mostly because she is such a b***h. But in a good way. Ultimately her life is empty too, but she finds purpose by serving the underserved and bullying others into helping her. She ended up being the most intriguing character out of them all.Anyways, I enjoyed these critiques that the movie explored. But I get why it's not satisfying to so many. The premise lends potential for exploration of so much more, but the movie was very focused on only one kind of critique. At the same time it wasn't very cinematic or structured and at times gets very boring, so it doesn't work that well. But I enjoyed what it had to say nonetheless.",Downsizing

The film has been accused of many things and, sure enough, it wanders awfully close to all of them, but Payne stays masterfully in control. It avoids being too full of itself, gets to each point slow but steady and it´s funny all the way.It´s a weird film indeed. I don´t mind the political implications and see it as a fairly straightforward fairytale, a hero´s journey or a search for destiny or identity.

Matt Damon brings his usual top shelf performance, and Christopher Waltz is brilliant as a character we have all crossed paths with. Kristen Wiig wasn't given enough screentime or lines to be fully understood in her reservations, and the later relationship between Damon and Hong Chau seemed forced or uneccessary as there was no chemistry leading up to it. The storyline takes on a different direction two thirds of the way through, - an obvious effort to bring it to some kind of finale.

The movie shifted gears into a rather depressing state and then moved in an entirely different direction than expected. Now, I like complicated story shifts if there is a point to them. But this meanders so much that meaning, purpose or even entertainment get lost. There may have been some messages which were intended but the story seemed so clumsy that I don't see myself watching this again to try and figure it out. Speaking of clumsy, some of the dialog and actions of the characters make some characters who are supposed to be good seem rather bad. I don't mind the portrayal of complex characters but this is another area where things are sloppily done. Matt Damon goes on a date with a woman and then gets mad when she declines to bring her son for the next date. This could have shown that Damon's character was feeling desperation for a relationship but it made him appear like a sleazy person. Another character who is later supposed to be a good guy completely disrespects his neighbors with no consequences.

174,dutchs-1,And then it gets weird,7,10 January 2018,"The first third of this film rolls along smoothly. A size reduction technology allows people to become 5 inches tall, with the result that modest wealth in our world becomes vastly multiplied in the miniature world. Before downsizing, people have to have all foreign matter, like tooth fillings, removed. (We find out later what happens if they're not.) Matt Damon and his wife (Kristen Wiig) decide to transform, but his wife, er wiigs out at having all her hair removed and chickens out. Matt gets miniaturized, and how do you get miniature people off the gurney? With a spatula, of course. He comes to and gets a call from his wife when he leans that she's still normal sized. Matt moves into his mini-home, which in his world is a mega-mansion.And here's where stuff starts getting weird. Suddenly he's living in an apartment building with upstairs neighbors. I must have blinked because I have no idea how that happened. His upstairs neighbor is Christoph Waltz. I'm so used to seeing Waltz in sinister roles I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop. Waltz is indeed a scoundrel, but he never does Damon any dirt.Repressive regimes, it turns out, find downsizing very handy for getting rid of dissidents. Damon encounters a Vietnamese activist who smuggled herself into America, after being imprisoned and shrunk, and discovers there's a dark underbelly to miniature Utopia, shipping containers turned into mini-slums. Because somebody has to clean the houses and do the dirty work.Lots of movies have a ""Deus ex machina"" to steer the plot. This one has a ""diabolus ex machina,"" (devil out of the machine), in this case a massive release of methane in the Antarctic. So do we suddenly have catastrophic warming? No. Mega-storms? No. Catastrophic social upheavals? No. Pandemics? No. We end up at the first tiny-people colony in Norway, which is preparing to take refuge in an underground vault to ride out the extinction-level event. Damon decides to stay outside and go home.It's awful hard to get excited about an extinction centuries in the future, especially when we're told it's an ""actuarial certainty"" but nobody has a clue what the actual cause will be. It's far easier to sympathize with Damon's discovery of the mini-underclass. But this film jumbles these themes around and pulls them out at random, like lottery balls.",Downsizing
175,soundoflight,Downsizing: Social Justice Lessons,5,28 January 2018,"In the two minute long trailer for this movie, we learn about what the downsizing procedure is all about and that Matt Damon's character gets downsized while he wife bails out at the last second. It literally takes the movie 40 minutes to explain all this (again) to the viewer. This cues the next act of the film, where the viewer is presented with some quite clumsy and ham-fisted social justice lessons. We learn (again) from Hollywood how rich white people are bad, and poor minorities are being downtrodden, and how the environment is being raped. And don't get me wrong: I'm not saying these aren't issues in society, but I'm getting tired of being clubbed over the head every time I want to have a bit of fun watching a movie. Amidst this backdrop, we follow the Matt Damon character around has he meanders through life as a small person. The story feels aimless. There was a hint of something interesting in how the character was a prototypical downtrodden ""nice guy"" male, but they never went anywhere with it. Damon's character just bumbles along with very little change in his self-awareness or behavior. If he were to have found some inner courage and started living life on his own terms and changed his fate this way, there might have been an interesting story there. But that's not the kind of story Hollywood is interested in these days. So all we have is laughs derived from how pathetic he is, and the only chuckles this film generated from me were in that context, which felt a little mean spirited at the end of the day.The positives of the movie were the special effects, which were done masterfully, and some interesting ideas that never bore fruit.

I found it to be a very good piece of film-making and entertainment.Do not be deceived by its sci-fi nature. The premise is just background to a greater story. It is a question asked ""What if people could shrink themselves to the size of a pen?"" and the answer is given in a low-key and grounded manner. We are exploring this question alongside the protagonist.However, the movie quickly strides into territory where it explores a variety of social issues: Debt, increasing poverty, environmental catastrophes, materialistic way of life, how technology can be used to both help and harm us, love, failure in life, commitment to others, etc. And it does what it does quite while, albeit not subtly at all.You won't find crazy action scenes, fast-paced car chases, evil robots or grimness. You will find a well-acted, well-filmed soft-toned drama/comedy.Highly recommended 8/10",Downsizing

The trailers for ""Downsizing"" are totally misleading. As the other reviewers have stated, the actual downsizing is only in the first half of the movie. The last half is a bizarre Austrian ""hippy"" like experience.Also, a very strange thing about the last half, the characters are floating through a river in the Austrian Alps on a boat and everything appears to be normal size. But in the first half of the movie they were supposedly downsized to 5 inches tall. That would mean their boat would be tiny and the slightest wave would flip it over....which never happened. And the mountains were in scale with the river and boat.

At first you get to see how the world is set up for the little people and how their money and material goods from the large world will work out to allow them to live a wealthy live when they are small. This in itself should have been explored more but many holes in this issue were not addressed. The plot then lost it's way as the story turned a few corners and we ended up in a disaster movie with the immanent end of the world. I understand when you are asked to suspend belief for a good story but this was not a good story or well told. Matt Damon has come a far way from his role as Jason Borne where he shone. His decision to be involved in this crap has me questioning who's advise he is following, and to ask him to stop listening to them.",Downsizing

191,wilsr,Truly dreadful,1,3 November 2019,"I can't believe I'm wasting my time talking about this movie!
Like so many other reviewers I was taken in by the first 30 minutes or so - an intriguing concept: to combat the damage that overpopulation and over consumption is doing to the environment and ultimately to life on the planet, people choose to be shrunk to a few inches and live in luxury whilst consuming little.
Obviously one has to suspend critical thoughts - there are so many breaches of scientific laws - but the story fits together well and is beautifully told until that 30 minute point. The CGI and cinematography can't be faulted, if the plotline is a bit ""Truman Story"".
Then - disaster! Almost instantly the film turns into a complete shambles, with jaw-dropping inconsistencies and laughable situations. A neighbour, apparently an antisocial creep, takes Matt Damon to Norway to join an armageddon cult burying themselves away to ride out the climate apocalypse. Lots of cultist 1960s - style hippy dancing. Tunnels constructed miles into the mountains, leaving no trace of digging works. I could go on but haven't the will.
Yes, man made climate change is real and is going to have very serious impacts on the environment in just a few decades. But this movie is just a joke if it is intended to make any point about it.",Downsizing
192,GODZILLA_Alpha_Predator,An uplifting and funny shrinking movie about our flawed society.,8,17 September 2017,"This is probably one of the most original movies I have seen in years. Director Alexander Payne and writer Jim Taylor have taken something so straightforward with the idea of shrinking and brought a thought provoking and satirical spin to it. This film tackles political ideas you wouldn't expect like the environment, immigration and the class system. In the near future, Norwegian scientists have figured out a solution to help the planet sustain itself from overpopulation. The answer: Literally make the population smaller. Years after the process called Downsizing became available to the public, people have been getting themselves shrunk and living the tiny communities built for them. Here Payne and Taylor use this concept to explore the economic and political ramifications as the people and governments abuse the technology to avoid the world's problems rather then taking a part to fix it. Average middle-class citizens are getting themselves shrunk not to help the environment but rather as an excuse to live like royalty in downsized communities like Leisureland since their credit will be worth way more at 5-inches tall. As news report talk about the fear of shrunken terrorists sneaking past borders, governments in other countries use downsizing to oppress the people by shrinking human right groups so their voices will go unheard.Looking through the story is Paul Safranek, played by Matt Damon. Damon brings a lovable charm and wit to Paul who represents the middleman that dreams of something greater. When Paul gets the chance to start over thanks to downsizing, this doesn't go as well as he planned. His wife Audrey abandons him before she can get downsized, he ends up working in a mediocre job in Leisureland and begins to see how flawed and unfair the world really. The real standout of this movie though is Hong Chau. While Damon's Paul represents the average American citizen, Chau's Ngoc Lan stands as voice of the lower class. As an activist that argued against her Vietnamese government's inhuman ways, she was sent to prison, lost a leg and later downsized to no longer be a bother to the system. Chau brings what could have been a one-dimensional stereotype an amazing sense of humour, and emotional complexity. When Paul begins to look at Leisureland's flawed class system through her eyes, it takes these characters on a huge life-altering journey. Also we finally get to see Christoph Waltz have a fun and memorable as Paul's rich, contraband-dealing neighbour Dusan.Payne and cinematographer Phedon Papamichael use scale to create stunning and hilarious shots. When we start with Paul at normal height, the shots are wide and open with negative space. Once we enter Leisureland, the shots and sets become more compact to make you feel the change in size. Payne definitely takes advantage of this being shrinking movie to bring so many hilarious visual gags from having a giant rose sitting on a dinner table to beautifully directing the funny sequence of Paul's downsizing procedure. The movie however struggles a bit with the narrative. It moves from one kind of story to another as it is tackling so much political subject matter. It did feel like it was different scripts that the crew worked on before combining them all into one. Kristen Wiig as Paul's wife Audrey felt like the cast member most affected by the in-balanced plot structure, as her screen-time was so short in comparison to the movie's run-time. The third act does become a little heavy-handed about global warming leading to a bit of bleak tone. But the movie in the end redeems itself when it cuts back to Paul's character growth. Despite some narrative issues, Payne doesn't loose sight of Downsizing's uplifting message: No matter how small we are or how large our problems will get and whether it is the fear of our crumbling society, a dying Earth or death itself, the solution is to face it not avoid it.",Downsizing
193,tlooknbill,"This ain't a Walt Disney movie, folks! It's comedic social satire!",10,29 December 2017,"Downsizing shows an example of how new technological breakthroughs that seem helpful for society can actually make things worse in unforeseen comical ways. It's also a story of one man's journey to discover his identity, value and purpose in life is not defined by the things and positions he seeks and pursues in society but by how he is motivated to serve and help others no matter how small or large in social stature.He thinks things will be better, cheaper and easier while preserving resources and the planet if he shrinks to five inches tall only to find his life is made up of the same series of mishaps, unexpected encounters bumping along in his new life with every new person he meets is now pretty much the same as it was at his previous size. But now he's forced to make meaningful decisions that provide value for his self and others he tries to help that didn't require a much smaller stature. It's just that becoming small put him at the right place at the right time.I think Hong Chau should win an Oscar in her depiction of a Vietnamese dissident who was forcibly ""downsized"" pointing out the use of this money/resource saving ""technology"" isn't equally valued. I liked this movie in how it conveyed its message and story.",Downsizing

It is cool to make fun of minorities who happen to work for you? Putting a German accented guy to do might bring back some not so nice memories. How can these Oscar winners or nominated got into this? If you are, like me, a big fan of movies, Americans mostly, you know there are good ones and bad ones, but the worse ones are those that you have the feeling someone stole the original script, got other two or three and mixed them as a practical joke to the movie director.

Although I went to watch it open-minded, I have to agree with the popular point of criticism that DOWNSIZING really feels like three films crammed into one.To start with the pros, the film is beautiful to look at, it somehow never gets boring while watching it and the first act is exceptionally good. But this is where the positives end for me.DOWNSIZING mostly suffers from its non-existent continuity plot-wise. Characters come and go, like Jason Sudeikis, who just disappeares after the first act, or Udo Kier, who, for whatever reason, is just there all of a sudden and literally doesn't do anything in the movie. The only constant in the entire plot is the passive protagonist played by Matt Damon, whose motivations are so unclear that the viewer can't feel any emotional connection to him. The cherry on top of this jumbled plot is the last act, which completely looses connection to the Downsizing-topic that got the film started in the first place.To sum it up, the premise of this movie is very creative and could have turned this into a satirical masterpiece, but unfortunately it is so messy and inconsistent that it fails to convey a clear message, which makes it ultimately disappointing.",Downsizing

200,LadyJackal,I'm being generous by giving this movie 5 out of 10.,5,26 July 2021,"Watch out for my comment because it may be disturbing.You can never convince any people to be downsized. Even I wouldn't agree to be downsized to the size of an insect. Let's say that I was convinced somehow, I will have to do it at the same time as everyone else. I can't accept even one person disagreeing to be downsized. That has to happen when everyone else is downsized as well. That's Because I am so skeptical of the homo sapiens. I would believe that even one person who wasn't downsized was gonna become a dictator,and press on the downsized people..... The mankind would easily crush a downsized person, breaking his bones, making him blood. Because that's what he does to the insects every single day . When the humankind is this much cruel, I will never believe that they won't do the same to a downsized person.....If you don't agree with me, if you're saying that the Homosapiens isn't that cruel, what about the children that kill the downsized community by accident? What if they Press onto a downsized person ? What if they are crushed to death ? How can one risk to be pressed to death like Matt Damon's character?Plus, i don't even think the children would kill the downsized people ""by accident"". Look at all the animal killers outside. They are all children . Just observe the children. They kill the snails for no reason! They chop a worm in half just for fun and they know that it'll renew its body - i did that as a child with a couple of friends, I'm terribly sorry as an adult. But I was not an exception. I was the perfect example of the Freudian definition of a child that is ruled by his criminality loving nature - and that's due to his id. Such is the cruelty of the humankind.

But what was most refreshing about Downsizing was that it's a love story between 2 people (who may or may not end up together) based almost solely in the fact that they deeply admire one another. They're not simply drawn to each other because each finds the other irresistibly sexy and can't keep their hands off one other. We've seen that a million times. These are 2 people who come to have a deep mutual respect for one another by the end. It's a message that we could use a lot more of in today's stories, and might actually inspire healthier relationships between people, instead of the old, boring, ""I know he/she is bad for me, but I see the beauty inside, and I just can't quite them"" nonsense.

But, occasionally/rarely, artistic merit slips by the vast emptiness of a shallow, mass-driven market. Why? There are no insects attacking little people. There are no classic, easily defined antagonists or protagonists. The main character does not need to be played by Sean Penn, and the story depicts a gloomy future that earthlings will not find very pleasant.
So why give it ten stars? Alexander Payne. As usual he provides a mirror for humanity to gaze into, giving us something to think about.

It is defnitealy more unique and original than some of Alexander Paynes other films, such as About Schmidt and Descendants. Once again he prooves himself as extremely reliable. I would still mantain the opinion that he has never made a bad film.My only real qualm with this film would be the acting, particulay Christoph Waltz's overacted crazy neighbour. Matt Damon is reliably normal as always but his character is actually quite boring, which is for the purpose of the satire.

But in Downsizing he went for the opposite - he took a situation almost too far fetched even for sci-fi and tried to make it appear mundane. The problem is when I am asked to suspend disbelief this much, simply showing a few slices of life is not enough. It needed a coherent story or at least some allegories, a message, some kind of a payoff. And I didn't find any of that. We are never shown the dark side of the nauseating happiness of small people and there has to be one - these people are basically in prison and when they are outside, they are at the mercy of the normal size people many of whom have contempt for them. The scenes showing the poor small living literally on the outskirts of the community are great, but it is never explained how and why they went small.

But I don't think that even without warnings I would've given this film a bad grade, since for me it was delightfully positive experience. The film dives into some really heavy matters and makes all the right questions. And then here and there we get to enjoy some very hilarious scenes and - dare I say - smart kind of funnies.The only letdown was the ending, which left the story a bit flat.

She will annoy you and make you laugh at the same time and she gets better and better the longer this movie goes, which is btw around 20mins to long.The rating of this film actually depends strongly on if you want to see it as a light hearted comedy, or a social satire.

The trailer got popular for a while on the internet, with people really excited by an original idea that got them thinking - plus there was a decent cast. But director Alexander Payne's latest film doesn't quite live up to its thought-provoking premise, instead allowing the plot to go stale, the pace to drag on and not quite shaping up to size.The basic concept of the film is what people come to see the movie for, despite the established talents of the cast and director. And whilst conceptually the film is strong, the story is not. Instead Downsizing moves from one aspect of the concept to another with a few weak narrative strings. This is largely because the plot is so thin once Paul decides to 'go small' that not much really happens, resulting in slowing the pace and sometimes erring towards the boring side. Although it takes too long for the 'downsizing' to actually happen, the first half is certainly the more interesting part; one where we actually get to see what would happen to our world if something like this was in fact discovered and integrated into society. Sadly we don't see enough of this though, which is a real shame as that was the real hook that brings an audience to the film. There are some pleasant messages to the film though; we should be saving the environment being one, we should pause and appreciate what we have now being another, but these have the habit of being a bit on the nose and obvious from time to time.More than the concept, however, it's the characters within the concept that drive a film like this. Matt Damon obviously is a very capable and likable lead, though there's nothing overly special about his character to make him interesting or memorable, but Damon carries the film very well. The use of Kristen Wiig's character is too short-lived and they got rid of her as soon as it was convenient to the plot, proving to be a disappointment as Wiig certainly has the ability to lend a lot of comedy to a film, sometimes with just an expression. The real scene-stealers though are Christoph Waltz and Hong Chau. It seems strange for Waltz to be cast as a Serbian, rather than an Austrian or German, especially since it makes no difference since he plays a stereotypical European partyboy (as is too often a stereotype of Europeans in American films). Still, he's the life and soul of the scenes he's in (a trait he's proved ever since Landa in Inglourious Basterds) and makes the most of a character that is largely superfluous. The real surprise in the cast though is Hong Chau's Lan Tran. Hilariously bossy but somehow endearing from the word 'go', Chau stamps her personality on the film effortlessly and almost saves the latter half. Downsizing is a small film that should have dreamed to be bigger than it is and be daring enough to really embrace its refreshingly original concept. Instead it goes from a conceptually captivating film to a fairly generic drama/quasi-comedy whose plot plods along, quickly forgetting the central premise that excited the audience. Certainly a pleasant watch, but a missed opportunity and far from Payne's excellent 2011 film, The Descendants.",Downsizing
229,cocobinay,Downsize your expectations!,4,25 December 2018,"From the trailers, this movie promised a novel concept, with a potentially powerful social commentary, or at the very least, a laid back fun Ant-Man type comedy!
DIDN'T HAPPEN!For most of the movie, there's little to suggest downsizing other than people talking about it.
The writing is atrocious and the story cluncky at best: We go from a family that decides it's economical to go small, to a divorce, to Mr Safranek tripping on drugs, then he's off playing missionary and cleaning houses for a living, because it turns out, poverty and inequality are very real in a downzised world that was sold to everyone as a solution to both poverty and inequality.The last act , the trip to Norway, makes no sense whatsoever: we find out that the very first colony has turned into some doomsday cult, whose grand survival we are only shown ... I kid you not ... on a powerpoint presentation. Paul's motivation in rushing to join them in the bunker is also unclear (even though he changes his mind in the end), to say nothing about immigration implications (some random guy from Omaha doesn't get to stay in Norway for 100+ years just because he decides he wants to).
The film is nothing more than wasted potential, not only in terms of talent (Matt Damon, Christopher Waltz, the 10 minutes of Kristen Wiig, Jason Sudeikis and Hong Chau) but also in terms of storytelling and the fascinating exploration of the world at a different scale.",Downsizing

231,mark-durfor,Downsizing is a Huge Disappointment,2,29 December 2017,"The world has reached a breaking point with over-population. A pair of Norwegian scientists have figured out a way to not only stop the human race from completely depleting the planet of all its resources, but also to provide a better and more luxurious lifestyle to anyone who chooses to participate in his program of Downsizing. His patients are shrunk to a height of 5 inches and live in an experimental community built just for them. While they are praised for their efforts, and communities are built in several areas of the world, only a small fraction of the world actually participate in the program.
Paul Safranek (Matt Damon) is a physical therapist living in Omaha with his wife Audrey (Kristen Wiig). Like many couples today, they are struggling financially to make ends meet. And, like many couples, they have at least toyed with the idea of Downsizing. At a high school reunion, Paul and Audrey talk to Dave Johnson (Jason Sudeikis) and his wife Carol (Maribeth Monroe) who have already undergone the irreversible process. They sing the praises of the community and get the Safraneks thinking even more about the idea. But it's not until they are denied a mortgage on a new home that they take the trip to New Mexico and agree to change their lives forever by Downsizing.
And that's really all we were told about the movie from the preview. It's an original idea, sort of. Dennis Quaid was shrunken in 1987 in a movie called Innerspace. Two years later, Rick Moranis accidentally shrunk his kids in Honey, I Shrunk the Kids. It goes all the way back to 1957 with the film, The Incredible Shrinking Man. But Downsizing looked like a new and different take on the idea of shrinking. The only other thing we really had to go on is that the movie is rated R, and there was absolutely nothing in the preview that even hinted as to why that would be. 
 
First, the R rating. There is plenty of full frontal male nudity in the film. It's completely unnecessary and used purely in a medical sense. First, a nude man is pictured to show the before and after effects of Downsizing. Then, a group of men are shown disrobed on tables undergoing the process. Again, it's not used in a sexual way, and there's really no reason we need to see everything they show to get the idea of what's going on. There is also one psychedelic party scene at Paul's neighbor's apartment that involves some drug use and brief nudity. And there are some F-bombs that, again, didn't really need to be in there. However, when there's no real substance to a movie, you tend to resort to things like that just to reel in some audiences. 
The people responsible for putting together previews really did their job well. I had no idea what this movie was about, except the basic premise, but I was very excited to see what it's all about. And those people deserve a raise because they not only hid any hint of why the movie would be rated R from the previews, they also concealed the fact that there's really no plot or substance behind an otherwise original idea for a story. Paul and his wife Audrey are separated at the Downsizing facility because men and women go through in different areas. When Paul awakes after the procedure, he gets a call from his wife who has changed her mind and leaves him alone in the shrunken world that he cannot come back from. After the divorce, Paul must sell the mansion that his modest earning afforded him in the Downsized world, and he moves into an apartment. He works at a call center and is pretty much miserable. One night, he decides to join his upstairs neighbor Dusan Mirkovic (Christoph Waltz) at one of his lavish parties. The next morning, he meets Ngoc Lan Tran (Hong Chau). She was a protestor in Vietnam who was imprisoned and Downsized against her will. Paul befriends Tran and quickly becomes her errand boy as she cares for those in the ""slums"" of the Downsized world. Paul and Tran join Dusan on a trip to Norway, the original colony. It is there they are told the methane gases released from the arctic snow caps have reached a level spelling eminent doom for the planet. So they have carved out an underground safe haven where they can live and repopulate. Paul thinks this is finally how his life will have meaning, but changes his mind realizing his love for Tran. They go back home and the movie abruptly ends. 
 
There were a couple chuckles throughout the movie, but it felt like watching an amateur comedian bomb on stage, or a magician who's tricks just aren't working. The idea was there, the actors were there, but there was no substance to this confusing, no point, slow-paced, unnecessary downer of a flop. I gave an initial cautious and curious 3.5 Star rating with so little to go on. But the preview for Downsizing certainly fooled us all and that rating will plummet to 1.5 Stars. It was not worth the price of admission in the theatre, I'll most likely never watch it again, even for free on cable, and I'll definitely never own it.",Downsizing
232,VHSdynamite,A meandering story abandoning premises,5,12 February 2020,"If you look at the journey of Matt Damon's Paul Safranek in this movie, it's really nothing much. He doesn't have that much problems to begin with, and then his wife leaves him, and then he meet a bunch of people and finds his calling in helping others.As other people have noted, the whole downsizing thing is unecessary for the story that unfolds after Paul's wife leaves him. Also, would it be better if she died? After all, the film is not a comedy, so whimsical events like his wife leaving him out of nowhere seem out of place.Anyway, the divorce lays the premise for exploring how it is to be stranded alone in an alien world that's perhaps not as rosy as promised. How would you cope? Would you try to make your way back into the normal world? No, Paul just gets a job and dates and everything goes on as normal. So what was the point of introducing the downsizing element at all?The downsizing lays the premise for exploring the societal consequences when a privileged few buys into a non-sustainable pyramid scheme (downsizing) to essentially live like tiny oligarchs. One character is even expressing these concerns, but the are never explored. What would happen when there were more tiny people than normal people could support? This could have been an interesting movie about societal collapse.The film does explore social inequality, but within the tiny society. This story is ok, but could just as well have taken place in the normal world.Towards the end the movie tries to make it about downsizing again by taking us to the original tiny community. The scientist that started it all has become disillusioned and out of nowhere (again) breaks the news that humanity will die. Paul is given the choice to go into safe exile with them, but ultimately chooses love.So what is the movie trying to tell us? I think it's trying to say that we can't escape our problems, but have to tackle them head on. But it was done in a meandering way.",Downsizing

Even something like a normal sized rat breaking into one of these downsized settlements would have been a better choice despite sounding insane!!

Guys trust all the 1 star reviews here and seriously skip this movie altogether. The trailer shows all good parts and even some more which are not in the actual film.As soon as the main character gets downsized this film turns into some bizarre charity show with a cult thrown in. The downsizing concept becomes totally irrelevant at this point. It's like the director wrote the first few mins of downsizing and couldn't continue it, so he got one of his old crappy script, joined them together and made a film out of it!!

Our track record at the cinema in 2017 has been dismal. Time and time again, every big-budget, star-packed, hyper-promoted Hollywood offering has left me wishing I stayed home to watch Netflix. When I saw the running time of 2:15, I was extremely reluctant to endure this movie.But, approximately halfway through the movie, something mysterious and unexpected happened. The sensation was so foreign I scarcely comprehended what was happening.I was enjoying the movie!Although ""Downsizing"" isn't exactly the most creative premise ever devised, the first half of the movie worked beautifully. I think a lot of filmgoers were disappointed to discover this movie is NOT akin to an amusement park 4D movie, where you are shown what it would be like to be smaller than a dandelion or bird. This is social commentary about economics and the human race.As such, I loved where this movie was going: Even in a society of staggering plenty, where an average Joe can afford a 10,000 sq. ft. mansion, nothing much is different. There is still divorce, alienation, obnoxious wealth, drugs, and an invisible, impoverished, foreign underclass that toils and suffers in the shadows. Brilliant.But then, inevitably, the iron law of Hollywood kicked in: IN THE YEAR 2017, ALL MOVIES HAVE TO SUCK. Of course. It's not fair, but it's the law.So, ultimately, it came as little surprise that the last 1/3 of the movie was a crap-fest about global warming, or something, and the world is ending because of methane, or something, but is it ending tomorrow or in two centuries, we don't know because we're not really told, and all the holier-than-thou environmentalists and scientists are going to go live in their hole-in-the-ground so humanity can survive, and yada yada yada. It was like a completely different movie, and it RUINED A PERFECTLY GOOD FILM.But in the end, all that matters is the movie fully and totally complied with the iron law of Hollywood.

Even the production design is unmemorable and ridiculous with the CGI also makes it unrealistic and a sore to the eyes and worst thing is that the this movie could offer is that the pacing along with a messy editing makes this film into a total snoozefest.Almost every member of the cast is also wasted on this movie. Matt Damon tries his very best in making his role relatable and likable to the audiences but instead features it as an racist, misogynist and an unsympathetic caricature of his performance combined with hammy and terrible acting. Even Christoph Waltz, Kirsten Wiig, and Jason Sudeikis are also terribly wasted and underutilized. The only silver lining and redeemable quality of this film was the stellar, complex, and scene-stealing performance of Hong Chau while also remarkably breaking the Asian stereotype.

In all its eager to be though-provoking, the script forgets to present us with an engaging narrative. Everything happens with virtually no repercussions later on. Furthermore, this movie holds too few laughs to be a satire, hardly enough drama to be dramatic and way to many minutes to keep the audience's attention.Matt Damon does what we can always expect with him: his best, but it's just not spot-on. His character goes through only a handful of struggles and his personal storyline regularly drowns in the overarching comments on humanity. In my view, the director should have chosen either the personal drama or the human drama instead of delivering only half of each, because now it's just very ineffective.The special effects of this movie are sadly obvious. The score drags on with the story.

What do you expect from the likes of Matt Damon and these Hollywood libs? Don't they know this is the Trump era? They're not allowed to make movies that incorporate their political opinions! Shun, shun, shun!/sDownsizing is the best satirical movie I've seen in years and one of the best films of the decade. It touches on so many issues: consumerism, comercialism, inequality, social stratification, humanitarianism, the risks of technological advance, and the extent of human reactions to personal and societal crises. Comedy is injected in all the right places so we don't get dragged down by the weight of these issues. It's truly amazing that Payne manages to capture and do justice to all of these themes in just over a two hour runtime and I honestly think the movie could have been a true classic if they had gone to three hours and fleshed out some of these concepts more fully. My only complaint is that the movie feels rushed in some places especially the final act.It's a real shame that most people can't appreciate this movie for what it is.",Downsizing
253,ivanaaaaaaaaa,A wonder-ful(l) movie!,9,23 November 2019,"I am absolutely baffled by the low score for this film. I hate how long it took me to watch it, and even more to think how many people are missing out just because of the low rating. :(This movie is so much more than I expected. I completely connected with the characters and their experiences, I could feel everything they were feeling - I was mad, sad, happy.. I teared up more than once. The sense of wonder throughout was overwhelming. I think the best way I can describe it is: Watching children experience things for the first time, seeing the amazement on their faces, and you feel it as well. There were also some sad parts, but they were necessary to get the point of the movie across.Hong Chau absolutely stole the show! She was the kind of person you could spend a day with and it completely change your perspective on life. The world needs more people like her character. Matt Damon was so effortlessly great, such a genuine character. And Christoph Waltz was hilarious! There were times when he didn't say a word, but I was cracking up because his face told us exactly what he was thinking.Please give this wonderful movie a chance.",Downsizing
254,Uwontlikemyopinion,Social Satire Isn't Everyone's Cup of Tea,8,24 March 2018,"Paul Safranek (Matt Damon) wants to please his wife Audrey Safranek (Kristen Wiig) with a better house, but cannot stay afloat financially as an occupational therapist. In Norway, scientists discover a solution to overpopulation with a program called Downsizing. Basically, the program is a miniature community that offers the average person the life style of a millionaire because the scientists shrink the individuals to five inches which means the ""downsized"" consume and waste less for the environment. What could go wrong?Matt Damon does a passable job as everyman Paul Safranek. Hong Chau steals the movie as Ngoc Lan Tran. While the movie has flaws (meandering pace and Matt Damon is a little bland), the story is integral. Essentially, Paul finds his life futile and decides to part take in the revolutionary program with Audrey; but ultimately, ends up alone and left in a new environment. Thankfully, he finds salvation and discovers himself. Also, Downsizing brings up interesting messages along the way about the hypocrisy of corporate hustle, environmentalism, and the dwindling middle class.This witty criticism of the flaws within society, or social satire, strangles the film in themes that take the story in different, sometimes unfocused, directions. Hence, not everyone is willing to follow the story. Another major difficulty in the film is when the film transitions from sentimentality to a more serious tone. The environmentalist theme becomes pessimistic. Much to my surprise, the ending won me over and I found Downsizing to be an insightful experience.",Downsizing

Even if you're looking for a movie about downsizing - chances are you'll be disappointed.The theme of shrinking your body size down is basically only a plot point in the first 20 minutes, as the film quickly loses it's sense of scale after that and just becomes any regular normal sized movie and the act of ""downsizing"" swiftly takes a backseat to make room for a sparse, mess of a plot with corny, unfunny quips and gags.Went into this movie looking forward to the inclusion of comedic actors such as Kristen Wiig and Jason Sudeikis, however they are criminally underused. Instead we follow Matt Damon, who lacks any sort of character substance as does Christoph Waltz' character, as well as Hong Chau's character who has this over the top Vietnamese accent which almost sounds like the same comical, ridiculous tone you'd find in a prank call. She was born in Thailand, but her accent in this movie is just so outrageous it took me out of it several times, it's almost like it was supposed to be funny.I challenge anyone to summarize any sort of plot this movie has a week after seeing it, this film is forgettable almost immediately after viewing and the only things that stuck with me are it's glaring flaws.

261,chatwithmichaelmac,Outstanding! A Adult fable for the times,9,1 October 2018,"This is a special movie - one of those quirky unheralded films that brings unexpected joys and surprises to those capable of 'getting it'.
Clearly, from the number of low scores here, the dumbing down of film-goers by empty and puerile block busters is almost complete.
This movie is no bit of cheap studio fodder...everything that makes an outstanding movie is in place here...the casting is perfect, the set design breathtaking, the script, direction and cinematography expert.
This is no 'incredible shrinking woman/man' nonsense...the 'downsizing' in the title is simply a hook upon which to hang an entirely different tale - more science fact than science fiction. 
'Downsizing' is an adult fable, a concept clearly lost on those taking a purely literal approach to their cinema-viewing and subsequently scoring all the low scores here. It's such a pity that people who simply don't understand or appreciate something so easily dismiss it.
The real point of this story is fairly obvious from the start but becomes perfectly clear aroun the midway point...and it has nothing to do with shrinking people. 
American audiences negatively commenting here aren't used to the subtlety of European/Australian/Canadian movies because the major studios have been mostly feeding them an assembly-line of easily digestible crap for most of their lives. Requiring them to actually think seems a bridge too far for the one star whingers.
Arthouse, independent and Indie films, thankfully, are changing that and as audiences expect more hooefully major studios will change their approach to movie-making.
This movie is an excellent one. It's not for those who need every tiny step along the way spelled out for them but nor is it complicated. It's what one could call a true cinema experience. It's got a lot of heart, a lot of love and a dark tale to tell. Give it a go!",Downsizing

264,danielbrown-47106,Better than I exptected,9,9 March 2018,"Normally trailers show all the funny parts when for this movie it was the case that some of the funny parts weren't even in the movie at all like the part with the oversize vodka bottle on the hill side.After reading some of the other reviews I feel I need to write a little in its defense. I personally like movies to be more than just an escape so this one that advertised as comedy both took me by surprise and impressed me with its underlying messages regarding sustainability, humility, greed, community and dare I say it ..god ..topics that are normally scoffed at in the privileged nations that are able to pour millions of dollars into apathy and movies that people attend whilst scoffing their faces with sugary, buttery, salty whatevers then complain about the resulting ailments from their gluttony like its somebody elses fault thus hinging on an outdated/unsustainable economic profile they're prepared to fight and die to defend all in order to support such reckless lifestyles and which largely only benefit the few elitists at the top. These are examples that are tapped on (like tender nerves understandably) and for this reason, one needs to watch with an open mind without expecting anything and I'm sure you'll then be surprised what emotions and insights can be cultivated.My review of Downsizing isn't to portray it as mere leftist propaganda on this 'new wave' of minimalism or political correctness as it delivers much more than this and this statement comes from somebody who is well informed on the issues of environmental, sociological, anthropological and historical impacts of our species and I barely crack a smile at most movies that are trying to be comedy. But this one had me tear up, it had me giggling and grinning uncontrollably, it had me literally 'lol' just the right amount where any more would have created a parody of itself which would be just too cheesy. The result was a well balanced movie that's successfully moving and both thought provoking and funny, as such I give it a solid 9/10 (as generous as they may be to most critics).Enjoy the movie and please vote kindly even if it might offend the sensitive psyche from our sheltered privileged lifestyles here in places where all we have to worry about is what kind of snacks we have to eat with our movie at night rather than when our next meal might come or if a bomb might fall on us in our sleep.

Kristen was only in the movie for about 20 minutes before she was gone as a character and that was disappointing. Matt Damon was good. Hong Chau was excellent as Ngoc Lan Tran. The overall plot seemed to be pretty good, though there were gaps in explaining certain items were missing. One was why there were no birds of insects allowed where small people lived. At the same time it seemed to be two movies, at first it wanted to be a comedy but in the second half it was preachy.
The plot to this movie was intended to make the case for climate change a crisis. It did this pretty well, it also made the point that any solution would also continue current cultural problems like class division and income inequality.

Interestingly it briefly highlights the fact as a species we nearly all died out around 70-100 thousand years ago.There are some philosophical issues touched upon in the film but all in all its confusing as a whole being as its neither one thing or another in the sense that you are never quite sure what type of movie you are watching.

The next person would write a new paragraph, continuing the story, then fold the previous back, concealing it, before passing it again. As it went around the classroom, the story grew, each person adding a new paragraph while only being able to see the one directly before it. Like when playing ""telephone"" the resulting story would be strange, disjointed, and end in a completely different place from where it began, with little idea how it got there.
""Downsizing"" feels like that. 
While each ""paragraph"" is good and interesting on its own, none of them quite fit together. Random plot detours leave the audience thinking ""Wait, what are we doing?"" and dizzy from all of the about-faces. Along the way, plot holes spring up, concepts are forgotten, and the type of movie you're watching morphs from science-fiction, to drama, to satire, to morality play, to apocalyptic dystopian, without any blending between the genres. It simply switches to feeling like a completely different film for 10-30 minutes, before changing again and going on.
The concept behind the film, shrinking people for economic and environmental purposes, is absolutely fascinating. The film brings up several points I never would have thought of, and treating the film as thought-experiment fodder may make it worth watching for you.
At its heart, the film is about a benign, runny-oatmeal bland man who passively allows demanding women and friends to sweep him along his life, and the one time he actually makes a big decision: to downsize, and how it ultimately ends up not changing things at all, except his height.
Matt Damon does a decent, watchable job of playing the oatmeal man, and Hong Chau plays a stereotype so well, the audience feels slightly racist for laughing.",Downsizing

The latter are bigoted and small at the same time. They are blind for what they want and what they want is insignificant. So without much further ado.The story is not about what you think it is about. If you haven't seen it yet. Not going into detail because spoilers abound and this one is worth watching the first time without knowing nothing about the film. Helps to avoid unnecessary expectations which seems to trouble some of the viewers. Suffice to say the story is original, witty, funny and heart warming. If you've liked Alexander Payne's earlier work, you will most definitely enjoy this one as well. Dialogue is borderline genius at times. If not. Acting wise I'm not sure if Matt Damon was the best casting choice, because contrary to his profession (in the film) he can come across a little too stiff or wooden at times. the if it is intentional, perhaps a lesser star (not to say smaller) would've been better. And while being the biggest star, he is undeniably shadowed by his co stars. Then again Christopher Waltz just shines too bright. Wonder how many watts Waltz is? Sorry.Visuals are charming. Camera work is solid and helps to forward the story, editing organic and smooth with little to complain about. Occasional issues with the scale ratios in comparison with actors/objects and the background are secondary and dismissible. Special effects are mostly very well done and explosions, funnily enough, are second to none. Sound helps to carry the atmosphere and situations. Emotionally it's not necessarily a roller-coaster, but it has its own spectrum that vibrates mostly in the humorous zone. Slightly damp or teary eyes are not improbable. The film could've gone in so many directions, but I am really pleased with the route Payne took. Human relations are kind of his thing and I think that some of the negative reviews are really blown out of the proportions (see what I did there), just because they wanted it to be a different kind of film. I figure most people just wanted to see small people doing small people stuff and that would be fun because they're small, but that is a very limited way of looking at things.

And boy, was I suprised...The main catch of this movie - scientists in Norway invent a way to shrink living creatures. Due to climate changes mankind decides to downsize the population, so that we produce less garbage, use less resources and let the planet heal itself. Cool concept, unfortunately, ruined by one thing - this movie doesn't know what it wants to be.I just don't know what this movie is about really. The first 40-45 minutes are intriguing, showing us the whole process of shrinking the person (Matt Damon), but everything after that is just a total bullcrap. It's a mix of a comedy, drama, love story, all sprinkled with enviromental babble and inevitable threat of the planet killing humankind (something about some gas leaking in the polar circle or some crap). The dialogues are cheesy and don't have any meaning, characters are either weird (Damon), annoying (that vietnamese girl playing the major role in the movie, have mercy) or just flat out dropped at some point (Wiig, Sudekis).There's also MASSIVE plotholes and logical flaws in this movie. Also, you never feel like the downsized people are in any danger at all. I expected to see some catastrophic things happening on those little folks, you know, like mini floods, flocks of birds attacking them, real people trying to take advantage of them, just SOMETHING to make me interested and put some context into the whole thing.In other words, it's not the worst movie ever made. I don't want to gauge my eyeballs and cut the part of my brain responsible for remembering the movie (like I felt after, say, Scary Movie 5, oh god...). But I'm not gonna say that this movie is good.

It tries its best in some sense, the effects are quite sublime I would say, incredible in a moment or two to depict small size regular daily objects.The problem is the story. It is simply artificial, everything is artificial except few personal moments. It somehow assumes that we will all understand what it wants to say yet it describes at least 5 different and incompatible elements that you do not know where they would end, and they end really nowhere.It is some sort of adult version of Gulliver's Travel with somewhat parallel confusion over a small and a big world. They actually did not make any mistake in connecting different stories, but those different stories are totally detached one from another. It simply does not work as a continuation, it is like 5 different movies stitched artificially together. I hope I will forget this movie soon enough. It would work ten times better if it is done as a comedy. This looks more like Tomorrowland with the same mistakes and omissions. I cannot even say that acting is good, since there is nothing to act against.Effects about small world and transitions are incredible and if the movie is just a little bit better it might be Oscar candidate. In this state, you cannot give this movies anything let alone an Oscar.I am so disappointed that critics is totally right with this one. It is one all over the place nothing in attempt.A bad one.

292,halfcolombian,The Outer Limits 2019,6,18 August 2019,"With this title I expected a movie about corporate america laying off thousands of workers, man was I wrong.
As a fan of the original Twilight Zone or more accurately the first black and white episodes of ""the outer limits"", I surprisingly found myself enjoying this movie much more than I had expected.
It certainly has an interesting premise which I'm sure you already know by now. What's sad is that for the moviemakers it's somehow easier to imagine people get ""downsized"" on a molecular level than imagening the removal of the capitalistic system. After you've miraculasly have shrunk human beings the old failed society will continue exactly the same just on a smaller scale. That I think is the biggest mistake of the movie, if one may call it a mistake. At the end of the movie a line from one of the characters hints that the producers indeed thought about this but ignored it.
If this shrinkening was possible it would certainly be free of charge, it would probably be offered mainly to poor people until they could guarantee safety for more ""important"" people going through this risky experiment. And the miniature society I assume would basically consist of daily health checkups and reporting to the real world. They would hardly need or even have time with stuff us normal people do. I very much doubt someone would have another job beyond reporting to the real world.
With that being said. It's worth mentioning the lovely actress Hong Chau which to me was a new aquaintance but she totally carries the movie. Christopher Waltz was also very good in a supporting role. I applaud the bravery of Damon of appearing in this. Certainly no masterpiece but these types of movies with this much artistic freedom are fun to watch no matter how they turn out.",Downsizing

I was expecting funny high jinks and gags based on the ""little people"" premise, but this movie carefully avoided them in order for the viewer to not have a single laugh. The entire plot develops like a nightmare for the main character, who is the most boring pathetic character ever. Even other movie characters tell him that. I have no idea what this movie was trying to say. Was it a mocking satire against the climate change propaganda or simply a climate change propaganda? I can't tell. What was the point of the main character dealing with horrible women? It's like the director was a misogynist or something. The only redeemable feature in the movie was the Vietnamese woman, whose straightforward view on life was refreshing to see in this dystopian nightmare.

That's very rare in film in the twenty first century.A quirky and refreshing concept coupled with very strong strong story and screenplay (9) and excellent performances (8). In many respects it's underlying message is ""the only constant in the universe, is change"".There's a tinge of ""The Truman Show"" in there as well, with a plot that might seem to fit the fantasy/scifi genre but lands more comfortably as a comedy romance.""Downsizing"" is one of these films that could readily skew left or right on a weird tangent at any moment but never does, instead electing to keep you in this sort of extended suspense. Kind of wishing the thing would hurry up and yet at the same time wishing that it wouldn't. The pace will leave you plenty of time for doing things at the back of the cinema and yet will make tears flow and laughter echo at the appropriate times.Alas there are problems though, as with many modern films and in this case that's with the Art Direction (1). Everybody knows this is a film about shrinking humans, and without spoiling the story we can obviously assume that this results in communities of humans in ""little worlds"".However the blatant design and art department errors in these miniature worlds constantly annoy the viewer and betray the fact that this is supposed to be what we're seeing.There are simply so many props, items and designs visible in these environments which simply cannot exist at this scale. This works to remove the viewer from the film and leave you asking questions as to what we're actually watching at times.So all in all a great story, great screenplay and great actors - ruined by oppressively lazy and ignorant production design. I've seen better art direction in high school short films than ""Downsizing"".If you're looking for a quirky story with morals, great unexpected turns and fantastic performances, ""Downsizing"" is definitely for you. But if you're a film aficionado and used to watching quality on the screen, this film will annoy and bug the crap out of you and leave you thinking you've seen better on 1970's B grade space films. 7/10, with the three dropped for the awful Art Department work.

The two completely different plot lines although both good, just don't gel together. Feels like one person wrote the first act and another person wrote the rest.

It also present this in a very personal way shown in the life of the protagonist as opposed to a macro view of its effect on geo politics and economics. The science is also very inaccurate, perhaps to make the movie more watchable. e.g. people shrunk to 5 inch should have very squeaky voice due to relatively larger air molecules but in the movie the shrunken people sound the same as their larger counterparts.

Charming without being sugary, moving without being over-sentimental, funny without being side splitting or resorting to gross out gags. The film carries several messages that are not exactly subtle but relevant nevertheless.
Wonderful special effects that fit in to the film without distracting from the story or becoming the centre piece and a musical score that also compliments.

There are then few if any comparisons to their size and the outside world (the rain is normal rain for their size and the boat scenes on a river is as though they were normal size), at times me forgetting that the characters are supposed to be small. Then toward the end of the movie there is a f*bomb fest with actress Hong Chau, maybe because the script writers liked writing it, the cast and crew members liked hearing Hong Chau say it, or Hong Chau herself liked saying it.

320,carkol2005,This is not even a movie,3,30 November 2019,"It's more like a TV-miniseries episodes poorly crammed in 2 hours with really bad editing in between one another. And this is the major problem with this ""movie"": once it starts to develop one plot point, it abandons completely to move forward to the next. This is one abhorrent screenwriting mistake and a very common one between amateur writers. Basically it's the first thing you MUSTN'T DO when you write a screenplay.Another problems? Well, you got glaring inconsistencies in the plot and in the characters, like for example Matt Damon's wife. I won't spoil anything, but in one moment in the movie she takes a decision that doesn't make a bit of goddamn sense. To be fair, the movie until that point was really interesting and it seemed to be building to something significant, but in the moment she makes that decision the movie goes downhill with no breaks.The characters are also horribly developed, not only the wife but also Matt Damon. He is this bland, uninteresting vessel of a person who does nothing but being a puppet to the plot, no personality whatsoever. The other characters like the Thai girl are obnoxious, with no weight in the plot (like Chris Waltz) or just like they were been cut off in post-production (like the scientist and all this stupid plan of saving the human race). Again, it's distracting because first you think these people are building into something but later you will see them turning into love clichés or background characters.The premise may seem promising (not giving too much away, basically some people are been downsized to spare natural resources and alleviate the economy), but don't let it fool you: by the third act you'll end up thinking that you're watching a horrible mix of Avatar and Deep Impact.The humor is awkward and dry and non-existent most of the times, which is unforgivable for a director like Alexander Payne. Dude, you made Nebraska and Election! The guy KNOWS how to write jokes! What happened in this movie? Has his brain been downsizing or something?Trying to look for positives in this movie, I guess the only thing I came up with is the first 20 minutes. They make a fairly good commentary on social issues, on segregation, and that's it. Nothing amazing but it's not bad. The direction is so-so, but on the other hand, the editing is pretty terrible!

Downsizing I believed, like most everyone else, was going to be a romp through small people vs regular people and would be a comedy. Especially since along with Damon they gave Kristen Wiig costar billing. But Alexander Payne knows how to do satire with very meaningful messages throughout.
The film has comedic flashes here and there in the beginning, but an hour in changes direction. The true costar should have been Hong Chau who ran away with it. The premise is that a Norwegian scientist discovers the ability to reduce all organic matter to 1/27th of its original mass. This is done to reduce the needs of humanity as to food, living space and is going to help the human race save itself from the oncoming overpopulation strain and the environment.
People may choose to downsize and because their costs of living will be much much smaller the money they have enables them to convert $150,000 to multimillions. There are small towns and developments sprouting all over the world. But as mankind does, there are those who misuse this miracle. Everyone becomes multimillionaires living in huge houses. No one has to work and all appears perfect.
Our couple, Damon and Wiig opt in, but unfortunately only Damon's character goes through it and that's the last we see of Wiig. After getting over the shock, Damon helps a Vietnamese Woman (Chau) who was downsized against her will as punishment for speaking out for human rights.
From the moment we are introduced to Chau's character she rules the movie. Her touching and often comical role makes the many messages about humanity, the environment and all the other concerns that come with ""downsizing"" easier to listen to. She's sheer perfection. Damon takes second seat as Chau dominates the screen.
There are several funny situations in the movie, but the ultimate goal is to make you think about these issues. The writer/director Payne gives us the satirical equivalent of a ""spoonful of sugar to make the medicine go down."" He artfully takes the ridiculous (actually downsizing the folks) and puts them in the communities that warps the meaning and reason why the scientists invented the process in the first place. The society, Damon's character learns, isn't free from the divisions among people based on income and jobs. Just outside Treasure Land is a slum like neighborhood that houses all the workers who make the fine living for the rich.
This movie wasn't marketed correctly. You believe you're going to see funny situations; there's no hint of the deep meaning and message that will be thumped into your brain. And Wiig certainly shouldn't have received star billing as that further confuses viewers. Chau is clearly the center point on which the entirety of the movie pivots. It's still an incredibly good original story and the special effects are great. But this is a movie meant to make you think. It's more like a satirical dramedy, but most definitely worth a viewing.

The problem with this movie is that it starts out really interesting and then half way through the main scifi selling point of miniaturisation is forgotten and the movie just becomes a divorced guy stranded in a supposed miniature world with nothing meaningful to do until Hong Chau comes into it. 
She brightens the whole thing up and provides more than a few laughs. I get the feeling that the producers savaged the special effects budget on this movie half way through, because after the first hour there aren't any that serve to press the point of miniaturisation.

Matt Damon's wardrobe alone told me I was in male Payne territory. Matthew Broderick in Election, Paul Giamatti in Sideways - ordinary to the point of being invisible and then, the downsizing, No idea where the story goes from here and neither does Mr. Payne. There is something of John Frankenheimer's Seconds, although, clearly, that's not Downsizing's intention. No, what is Downsizing about? I never ask myself that questions because I usually don't have to, but I have to now. I have no idea if it was an an allegorical piece too clever for me or was it that the great Alexander Payne was venturing into virgin territory with one of his old invisible characters as a guide. Without having everything quite figured out. Hong Chau is lovely but was she suppose to be comic relief, tears and all?

The cinematography is good, at least.Matt Damon does a pretty good job, but anybody could have been in this role. It wasn't unique. Same with Udo Kier and Christoph Waltz. Waste of talent.By the end, the film becomes a vehicle for ecological warnings instead of an interesting character study. It was flat, predictable, and too long.

347,niko-oinonen,"A missed opportunity, yet a delightful surprise",8,25 August 2018,"While I appreciate Downsizing for trying to actually say something with its unusual premise, it misses some opportunities to have fun with it. Although it has those visual comedy moments as Paul, played by Matt Damon adjusts to his new life as a downsized person, it misses many good opportunities to show us the world through the eyes of a tiny person. It's even missing some of those moments already shown in the trailers. I can't help, but wonder, why they were left out. It sacrifices the humor for the message, when it wouldn't had to do so. You can have comedy and tell a serious point. Early on it the film we learn that downsizing is the way to save the planet because smaller people consume less resources and pollute less than the normal sized. Other films might contend with just that and focus on the visual comedy. Downsizing isn't that naïve. For Damon's Paul, downsizing more of a way to save his failing marriage, even though he might delude himself by saying that he's going to save the world. After Paul gets himself shrunk the whole idea is left more in the background for a while. At this point the tone of the film also changes. We find out that the world of the small has the same that the normal world has. There are poor people living in slums in the outskirts of the cities who perform the more menial jobs of the society. What's more, we learn that the downsizing hasn't been successful solution and the world is still facing its end. It's in this second half of the film that it ends up finding perhaps a more interesting direction than I had anticipated. It's about the small things we do for other people in life that truly matters, not necessarily trying to save the whole world.",Downsizing

352,bottomsgaming,"Good Idea, Dull Execution",5,4 January 2018,"Downsizing is an interesting satirical concept that is forced into a mediocre film about climate change.The first 45 minutes or so are lighthearted and funny. We get some general explanations about downsizing itself, and then some almost-too-long scenes illustrating the process happening to our main character, Paul. This is complete with some Fallout-esque, over the top utopian imagery of the downsized world that would lend itself perfectly to comedic (or dark) satire.From here, the movie abruptly shifts into a serious look at our class systems, climate change, one's purpose in life, etc. These are huge themes; each of them could be - and have been - given many films of their own to explore more deeply. Alexander Payne kind of just throws all of it into a blender during the remaining 70% of the movie, and not a whole lot sticks.There's some interesting concepts, sure, but nothing is really explored, or maybe it just takes a smarter person than me to put this all together. We get an interesting look at how downsizing doesn't change the class system for our characters. There are still slums that appear to be largely divided by race. But the film doesn't explore this any further. Now we move on to climate change, which downsizing also didn't solve. The human race will still apparently go extinct (one character says so, at least. They're portrayed as smart, I guess, so I think we just have to believe them, as Paul does). The problem, here, is that none of it is particularly engaging, and it only loosely has to do with the original concept, downsizing.Our main character, Paul, is sort of an empty vessel without any goals in life or any personality to speak of. This makes it easy for other characters to drag him through the plot, but doesn't provide any investment for the audience.Hong Chau plays Ngoc Lan Tran, a Vietnamese activist. She is delightful, to be honest, and provides almost all of the entertainment and levity for the entire second half of the film. Without her, I'd have been asleep before the third act. If anything, the film relies on her quirky mannerisms and English accent for laughs a little too much, but considering how dull everyone else is, I won't complain.The original concept of downsizing feels more like a gimmick to get people into the theater than an idea Alexander Payne wanted to build around. It feels like he had an interesting satirical idea of downsizing, another strong opinion on climate change and the future of our race, and thought he could tie them together much better than he actually did. My problem, though, is that the movie was 100% advertised as the former, and we just didn't get much of that. It's a shame, too, because there are some good shots, great dialogue, and adept film-making that are hampered by everything else.There's half of a funny movie and half of an interesting one, here. Unfortunately, we didn't get either.",Downsizing

359,fredlondi,A film that hates its own premise - and its audience,1,2 January 2018,"I feel like I just got trolled.""Downsizing"" was marketed as a harmless comedy with a silly premise. Matt Damon as a down-on-his-luck everyman who decides to undergo a trendy new procedure where he's shrunk down to five inches tall, thus allowing him to live large in a miniature utopia. His wife gets cold feet, leaving him stranded in the strange new world. Unable to go back, he learns to love it, both through the perks of drinking shots from a now-giant bottle of Absolut Vodka, and from helping those less fortunate than he now is. I went into this movie fully expecting the story to play out exactly like that. I was okay with that. I thought the premise had a lot of opportunities for comedy, like the scene from the trailer where Damon's told to sign his name ""as big as he can"" on his divorce documents. I wanted to see what other gags they came up with (and with the R rating, I hoped, lots of the raunchy kind). But ""Downsizing"" is a film that hates its own premise - and its audience. And it isn't a comedy.This is, unbelievably, an environmental film. We learn before the title card - but after you've bought your ticket - that the scientist behind this process intended for everyone to voluntarily be shrunk in order to lessen their carbon footprint. Having a message is fine, but this film is completely unsuited to it. I wanted to know so much more about what it was like in the miniature towns, how they're maintained, and the massive changes in society caused by an increasing portion of the population choosing to cloister themselves in remote parts of the world. But details like this are ignored by the film, brushed aside in order to push its environmental message.The environmental message puts an immediate stop to the comedy at around the twenty-minute mark. It's here, after the aforementioned divorce, that Matt Damon loses his house in the settlement, is forced to live in an apartment under a sociopathic Christoph Waltz, and befriends a Vietnamese refugee who lives in a miniature slum located just outside the compound's exterior wall. From this point forward, this is a completely different film. I'll admit, the idea of there still being inequality in this utopia was interesting to me, as I thought we could explore the limitations of the world of the film. But the film chooses not to do this because that would have meant that our environmentally-conscious scientist who came up with all this was an imperfect character, and the film couldn't have that. Once again, the message hamstrung the film.The only purpose of the bizarre slum scene is introducing a Vietnamese refugee who apparently was sent overseas in a TV box, a brutal and inappropriately comedic allegory to human trafficking. This refugee is one of the worst characters in the film - loud, obnoxious, and stubborn. While we first empathize with her as someone forced to clean houses for a living, we next see her steal painkillers from her boss, give her roommate too many of them so that she dies from an overdose, and never thanks Damon for his help, including fixing her fake leg.One of the many things the Vietnamese girl forces Damon to do is bring her along on a trip to Norway, where both learn from the creator of ""downsizing"" that all of humanity is going to go extinct because a methane bubble released from a melting Antarctic ice shelf is being released into the atmosphere. Both happen to arrive at the scientist's compound just in time for them to escape into a subterranean tiny town for 8,000 years until the atmosphere corrects itself. Damon wants to go along, but the Vietnamese girl won't go, and guilts him out of it. And so, Damon returns to his miniature home, confronting his own death.You may be thinking that all this sounds depressing. You're right. Worst movie to release on Christmas since ""Marley and Me."" Late in the third act, there are three moments thrown in for comedic effect. Each is so jarring that they feel completely out-of-place and inappropriate because by then, you've completely forgotten that this movie had a few laughs in the first act.The message continues to bludgeon you to the very last frame. The environment. The environment. The environment. Any character who questions this is written off as a crackpot (and they're invariably white). This includes Damon's dying mother, who asks the perfectly logical question why scientists are more concerned with shrinking people than curing her illness. There's also a man at a bar who asks why downsized people should vote when they essentially live on reservations maintained by full-sized people, often pay no taxes, and are wholly unconcerned with the outside world even though one well-placed bomb could wipe them all out.It's also a tone-deaf film when you really get down to it. The trailers seemed to set up for a theme about the pursuit of happiness, where perhaps Damon finds himself choosing a kind of life he already had before the procedure. But the lesson instead seems to be that humanity is bad, that we're all the seeds of our own destruction, doomed to die like dinosaurs. So the best way to save us all is to shrink ourselves to the point that none of us are big enough to build a spacecraft large enough to stop the asteroid that will crash into the planet and kill us all anyway.The film also did a great job of making you not want to get ""downsized."" From getting your hair and eyebrows shaved to getting a big rubber thing stuck up your rear end, to being forced to drive the same tiny bland white electric cars, there's just not much of a list of positives here. The community Damon picks doesn't even seem all that nice - just move to Tustin and save yourself the medical costs. Plus, there isn't even anything to do - no miniature sports teams or movie theaters. They all seem to just sit around and talk, as if everyone who does this is just the most interesting person, and conversation is all they need to get by on. I love that they mentioned having three Cheesecake Factories in one community, as if someone is going to sell all their possessions and shrink themselves just to work at the Cheesecake Factory.For a film trying desperately to be contemporary, ""Downsizing"" is a terrible title, too. The only context for the term is being let go by your job, a reality facing too many in recent years. Turning the word into a positive with some environmental spin is just stupid to me.But, hey, there's lots of full frontal male nudity in this movie. That creepy, clinical, Westworld-style nudity. Don't know why that was in there and not, say, that Absolut Vodka scene from every trailer Paramount made for this movie. We need to have truth in advertising when it comes to movie trailers. There was a clear intent by both Paramount and Matt Damon to mislead moviegoers into thinking they were seeing some kind of fun ""Honey, I Shrunk The Kids!"" film, but with adult humor deserving its R rating. What we get instead is the same thing that's on every news channel - politics, politics, and more politics. I'm tired of it, and you should be, too.Start being part of the solution by not seeing this movie.P.S. I'm not going to carp about this without offering solutions, so here goes: if you're not going to make this a comedy, why not make it an action movie? They put Jason Bourne in it for Pete's sake. Why not have the scientist who came up with the program be the villain who looks over the tiny town like Cristof in ""The Truman Show,"" getting off on playing God by causing disasters and demanding obedience from those under his control. Maybe he even stomps his way through the town himself (like a Godzilla film or that mole scene in ""Arrested Development""). Illustrate the changes in the law allowing him to get away with it, or how authorities turn a blind eye in favor of their own interests. Have Damon reach a moment like in ""Attack on Titan"" where he realizes everyone who's been downsized is someone deemed unfit by the ruling class, that their world is not a home, but a prison. Then have him spearhead some kind of ""Gulliver's Travels"" effort to negotiate the compound and take down the scientist. Boom. Come on, Hollywood, where's my check?",Downsizing
360,eno2000,Forget About the Trailer,8,7 April 2019,"Much like a lot of other reviewers, I saw Kristen Wiig, Jason Sudekis, and Matt Damon and figured this is probably going to be a comedy akin to a Judd Apatow film. It isn't and you shouldn't expect that if you want to really appreciate the film. I felt this had more in common with Wim Wender's Until the End of the World, only a little more lightweight in some regards. Much like the dream recording and sharing technology in Until the End of the World (which is more fully integrated throughout that film), the downsizing technology in this movie is simply a vehicle form some much needed social commentary.If you're not an idiot climate change denier, then this movie will resonate somewhat. But even there, it tries to go farther than just climate change and touch on what our real purpose on Earth is and that is where it falls down a little. I think if it had a running time closer to Until the End of the World, it could have succeeded. Overall, the main point is that the main character, played by Damon, wants to do some good in the world for others. He's a physical therapist, which shows that he wants to be helpful. Through the film he's given several messages (indirectly) that strongly indicate that any kind of self-aggrandizement he tries to engage in ultimately fails.When he and his wife (Wiig) plan to downsize, his dreams are shattered when she chooses not to go through with the irreversible process and he's essentially abandoned by her. When he is trying to get a relationship started with someone and he pushes too fast and too hard, he is again disappointed when he's told that the other person is not ready for that yet. Later in the film he wants to be a part of this big plan to essentially seal a group of ""downsized"" people into an underground ark. The woman he realizes he loves doesn't want to do this and he has to choose. This time, instead of being part of this big plan to preserve humanity in the face of the inevitable end of mankind due to our damage of the environment, he decides to stick it out with the woman he loves (albeit at the last minute).The more I thought about the movie after seeing it, the more I realized this really had the potential to be as important a film as Until the End of the World. It even had a similar feel at points due to the international cast. There is nothing better than films that show unity among the nationalities of the world. I've never viewed myself as an American because America is so counter to my nature, but it is the country where I was born. Instead I consider myself a World Citizen like some of my idols and this film really is made for the World Citizen mindset. If that is you as well... my friend you will enjoy this movie. I just wish it was a little longer and more fully built out.",Downsizing

365,blisterpeanuts,"Politically correct, unscientific, pointless drivel",1,22 March 2020,"First the good points. Done. Now let's get on to everything that's wrong with this movie. And that would be... everything.Take the premise (please!). A Norwegian (of course) scientist develops a way to shrink living humans to 5 inches tall, with the goal of saving the environment. If all 7 billion of us shrank, we would use a tiny fraction of the resources and cause a lot less pollution. A company then commercialized the technology, advertising a sumptuous lifestyle in palatial mansions for people of modest means.A surprising number of suckers buy into this, and permanently downsize themselves to live in this Disneyland-like town of mini people.But Damon's wife backs out at the last minute, after he's already shrunk to the size of a mouse. This pretty much ends their marriage. It's not like they can have a normal relationship ever again, anyway.So Damon just soldiers on, finding his way in this new downsized world which turns out to be pretty much identical to the normal sized world. In fact, the science fiction leaves the room after the first 40 minutes and we're left with a boring, pointless attempt to justify the movie. A failed attempt, I should add.Cinema Sins would have a field day with this movie. For one thing, apparently no one stops to consider how dangerous it would be to live as a tiny weak creature. You would be easy prey for almost every animal on the planet. A cat would toy with you, then kill you. A dog would crush you in his jaws. A rat would chew you up. Even a frog might eat you. Countless birds of prey would dine on you and your kind. Even chickens would peck you to death and eat you. Spiders would wrap you in silk and inject you with eggs. Just imagine what bees and mosquitos would do to you.The amount of suspension of disbelief this movie requires is... well... unbelievable. It's a ridiculous premise to begin with, and was very poorly implemented.Now, as a horror movie, it has some potential, but obviously they didn't choose to take it in that direction. But should have. It would have been scary as hell to wake up downsized and having to run and hide from rabbits and squirrels and scorpions.

That is honestly the foundation of anything that goes on a screen. Sadly, this show decided to take that foundation and attempt to make it into a 2 hour plot which only results in a very slow and uneventful show. With nothing really added to keep a persons interested we are left watching an average man do everyday things only he is 5 inches tall but that never really effects anything. So really, it is a story about a average man doing everyday things for 2 hours. The show does have some redeeming aspects. The idea is original, some of the visuals are amazing, the characters are okay but two really stood out and took the spot light which did help save the show. If you like shows that are more mundane and about self-discovery than you will likely enjoy this movie but if not than it is not worth the time to sit through.",Downsizing

371,Fredex8,A good film... but apparently only if you didn't see the trailer...,8,15 April 2018,"Most of the negative comments here seem to just be people complaining that the film wasn't what they expected it to be from the trailer and then not even bothering to give it a chance.I never watch trailers because they almost invariably spoil films by giving away big plot points or they paint the film in a totally different light to how it actually pans out so I feel that these people should be more annoyed at the concept of film trailers than this film itself. I watched the trailer after reading these reviews and can see how it must have misled people and attracted totally the wrong audience for the film however if the film was solely like the trailer it would have just been a generic, predictable sitcom like comedy and not worth bothering with.That said if you went into this expecting it to just be a lighthearted comedy I can see why you wouldn't like it. It is truly a bizarre film that feels like three films in one with quite jarring segues between the vastly different sections. Going into it not remotely knowing what to expect however I enjoyed it even if I did occasionally wonder what the hell was going on or what it had to do with anything... though it did ultimately pan out and make some kind of sense.There's lots of interesting and accurate social commentary to ponder on and the ultimate concept of using this shrinking technology to make it easier to ride out an apocalypse is very unique and intriguing... even if the science behind the shrinking is ridiculous. I mean I feel they sort of missed the opportunity to show people carrying away huge sacks of all the discarded 99% cellular goo the body would leave behind after the process of shrinking. It would have been amusing, more believable (rather than magically shrinking the entire body down) and more in tune with the message of wastage the film was pushing. I also really wanted a scene of them shaving a bemused horse and removing it's shoes so it could be shrunk down... There were quite a lot of missed comedy opportunities but if the film was just two hours of jokes like that it would have become dull fast.My only real criticism though is that for much of the film the notion of being small is irrelevant. The few normal size objects that appear in the small world are quite amusing but they are few and far between and the only real reminder that they are small for much of it until the Norway scenes near the end with the 'forest' of grass and flowers. These were pretty cool although trying to sail a tiny boat across a massive fjord was pretty ridiculous as you'd capsize at the first sign of a wave.Another criticism I have seen people leveling is that the idea of poverty makes no sense if money goes 50-100 times further but this is sort of missing the point. Even in a society that is trying to be a utopia there will always be crap jobs to do and exploitation. It touches on the idea of people forcibly being shrunk against their will, which seems like something some nations would absolutely do to prisoners if they could but it misses the idea of a new kind of slavery. It is entirely plausible that in a job starved economy businesses would pay for the cost of shrinking people down and have them work off the debt in the small world, and that people would inevitably fall into that trap, much as they do in real world society.You also have to assume that if the majority of people there are comparatively far richer than in the real world because money stretches so much further that any jobs that were available would pay a pittance in the small world and that this would go even less way in the real world. Situations like that which the main character finds himself in would happen frequently and many people would get stuck in this world without the funds to pay for the life they expected.",Downsizing

373,thejacobmello,Behind the Popcorn with Jacob Mello,4,8 February 2018,"If you plan on seeing this movie, do yourself a favor and downsize your expectations. You'll often hear writers talk about a phenomenon that happens mid process: at a certain point, it's as if the characters start talking to you and instructing you on where it is they'd like to go. What you don't hear about as much is how important it is to veto the shit out of most of their ideas. Especially when your main character has a serious lack of agency, and most of their ideas are just going along with side character's ideas and calling everything in between ""fate."" The concept was world-class, and that makes the lack of any other good things to say here that much worse. At several points during this film the protagonist stumbled into situations that would have made for an intriguing storyline, only to simply walk past it and get himself into a completely different, significantly less interesting predicament instead. It was like being in the presence of a once in a lifetime spectacle and spending the entire time attached to a toddler following a balloon. The tragedy here isn't in how bad this film was - though, yes. It was certainly that. The tragedy is in how brilliant it could have been. I love almost all of writer/director Alexander Payne's work. He's made a career of extracting the beauty out of mediocre at best books and turning them into beautiful, thought provoking films. That being said, this was never his movie to make. I don't know if it's capitalism that's to blame, or ball-hoggery, or the artists desire to enjoy his life and express himself and personally breathe his own unique ideas into fruition (probably at least some of that last part), but screw that. If Chris Rock gets a joke idea questioning the airlines assortment of mid-flight snacks, the classy thing to do is text it to Jerry Seinfeld. This is no different. This premise was a Charlie Kaufman(Being John Malkovich, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Synecdoche, New York) concept, through and through.

Apart from Hong Chau putting some effort in and having a character with at least some depth, everything and everyone just fell incredibly flat. Has to be the easiest money Christoph Waltz will ever make - just play the same role he's played countless times now.

I was genuinely interested with the social political and economic constructs the movie was exploring but then they completely lost footing and the plots evaporated and went nowhere. I'm saying this as someone who is scientifically minded and aware of the reality of climate change.. it's real.. but this movie didn't ultimately address it in an intelligent way. In fact it was embarrassing to see.As others have said many of the notions put forth by the film didn't even make logical sense like the shanty towns and poor folk who somehow scrounged up enough money to be downsized but was so penniless they lived in utter poverty anyway.

404,jozii89,Not as bad as people say,8,29 January 2018,"What I disliked about the second half of Downsizing was that the actions of the characters confused me, as not enough time was given to fully explain the premises of that part of the story line. And I believe said premises, which are indeed not included in the trailer at all, is why people - unfairly, in my opinion - hats this movie so much. That said, the actual story line and ending is really quite brilliant (if a little on-the-nose). I'll get back to that in a minute.The first half of Downsizing is a GREAT adaption of what the trailer sets the movie out to be. Plenty of time is given to the fascinating subject and idea of making parts of the population small to live like kings in miniature cities, and the many perks and unforeseen obstacles such a life might include. Small scenes with various one-time characters as well ""TV news in the background""-style scenes also give us a clever glimpse of how the ""big world"" handles the subject of downsizing. Should small people be allowed to vote same as big people, for example? What about trafficking and other global issues? If the movie would have spent its second half focusing further one or more of those unforeseen issues, perhaps it could have been remarkable.But instead things take a turn, and the movie becomes what it's really meant to be: a satire. I won't spoil the topic, but if you're reading reviews you already know that the second half is not about the life of small people. It's about something much bigger (hehe).And I honestly feel like this was an absolutely brilliant take on that. If only the trailer would have given us more of a realistic promise, I believe more people would feel the same. A lot of people also seem to complain about the length, but the movie moves along at a quick pace and is always kept interesting. In fact, maybe a little too quick as the whole reason I disliked parts of the second half is that it wasn't properly explained. Things just sort of... happened.What makes me feel that it's brilliant is that, the more I think of it, the more I realize that these things were actually explained. You just had to use your brain a little more, and think a bit, well, bigger (there we go again).Take long distance travel for small people, for example. Immediately after watching it I wished that that's something they would have showed more of as it's an interesting question (how do small people travel long distances?). But again, it's not meant to be that kind of a movie, despite what the trailer (and first part of the movie) had us think.Bottom line: Perhaps Downsizing should have been two movies with very different takes on the idea - one that is what the trailer sets it out to be, and one that has more of a ""global issues"" feel. Regardless, I thoroughly enjoyed it.",Downsizing

If you are the type of person who likes weird, you'll probably dig this film. If you're the kind of person who prefers predictability and by-the-numbers painting, this film will definitely get on your nerves. I can't really say much about this film without giving too much away. Matt Damon is solid as always. Hong Chau is by far the star of this movie; she absolutely stole the show. Her no-nonsense vulnerability and strength is often seen in female asian roles and it's definitely in demand. The plot is intriguing but this movie does seem to meander at several points. I was definitely bored in a few places, and sometimes the message was so muddy all I could do was stare and grin blankly like Cristoph Waltz does in so many of his scenes. Don't get me wrong, I love Cristoph, but it's almost as if they forgot to give his character lines or direction in several scenes.

The whole downsizing to save the earth is very related to modern day how human cope with the climate change on our earth.

I'm watching a comedy...no I'm not I'm watching a satire....wait, it's a drama...or is it a social commentary?....actually now it's an environmental awareness propaganda piece.What have you done Alexander Payne. How can someone who directed movies like Sideways and Nebraska then create such a rambling, shambolic, unstructured mess as Downsizing?It's a deplorable, ill-conceived disaster of a movie which wastes the talents of a whole host of ably talented comedic actors, sacrificing them on the altar of political correctness.
If you are so concerned with ""saving the planet"" then why waste so much time, money and energy producing garbage?
Why not instead use the sixty million or so it cost to make this movie to buy a yacht for some sixteen year old so she can sail the world and lecture us? ...

Obviously he is doing this on purpose in the film sending a message for everybody. Maybe the message is: yes in the face of some corrupted politicians who call these poor people trash.

430,TonyAtTheMovies,Big issues in a small world,8,7 July 2020,"The idea of miniaturisation isn't a new one in fiction - think of the 1950s film The Incredible Shrinking Man and at least one Doctor Who story where the TARDIS crew find themselves in a 'giant' world - but this film has a different, ecological and social, angle. For a start, over the story's timespan thousands of people are being miniaturised, creating their own communitiy and giving rise to issues of difference and prejudice. This particular story charts one man's journey through this and how he meets these issues. To say that the film is ecological/social in its approach doesn't make it heavy or 'preachy' as the issues grow quite naturally out of the scenario of so many people becoming 'small' (rather than a lone individual or small group as in many previous stories with the same plot device). The film's director has said that he didn't want to make an especially political movie - it's just that the situation in the movie quickly takes on political aspects, as situations often do in real life.
But as a movie Downsizing is very watchable, and a very humane story. It's billed as a comedy, whereas I would place it under 'Comedy-Drama' - it's not laugh-out-loud material but there are some nicely observed moments in it. Oh, and in case you're wondering, at no point do any of the protagonists get chased by a King Kong-sized cat etc.",Downsizing

This movie meanders like the line at the DMV. You're just there, but there's no enjoyment to be found.This movie's largest value lies in how accurately it portrays climate alarmists as: pushing extreme measures, unquestioning of what they're told, lacking critical thinking and ignoring reality.At one point a scientist tells Damon's character that the world is going to end because some methane gas was released. Damon's character never questions this, or asks how or when it will kill all human life. He just accepts it and decides to live out the rest of his life in a hole in the ground. Before you make life altering rash decisions, I'd want to know a little more, but maybe that's just me. It's also spot on, regarding the ignoring of reality. At one point the ""little people"" colony in Europe, stare at one last sunset before going into an underground protective chamber. The blaring irony is that in reality, it was a beautiful day, the world's just fine. The planet isn't dying. But instead of looking at reality, they submit to their faith in a religion preaching the world is going to end. Even if the world was going to end, why wouldn't you wait until you need to seek shelter? Their ""solution"" is a million times worse than the problem. This basically sums up the ""global warming"" movement perfectly.Honestly, I think small humans would be much more likely to go extinct from a bunch of roving alley cats, or a hostile Communist country who would no doubt, wait until we miniaturize ourselves and then would take us over. In the end, this movie was as slow as it was silly, lacking any humor...a complete waste of time, wrapped in another incoherent rant on how humans are killing the planet.",Downsizing

* A passive, weak emasculated male (Jason Bourne yes!) being bossed around by a bossy women. A standard feminist trope.
* End of the world climate change nonsense pushed to an extreme.
* Communist-type kumbaya communes made up of Bernie Sanders' beloved Scandinavian social democrats
* Evil greedy hedonistic old white capitalist men who don't care about the planet or anybody by themselves.
* The poor diverse workers who are all enslaved to serve the above rich whites. They live in slums and die like flies and nobody cares.

462,liveliferegister,Choose to focus on the loopholes or simply bask in the beautiful sunset!,7,8 May 2020,"A unique and interesting plot!On a lazy evening a few weeks into the lockdown, on wanting to watch something light, as I was browsing through Netflix, this movie came up and without even knowing anything about it, decided to watch it.It took me 10 minutes to realize that I am watching Matt Damon and not Mark Wahlberg.But what was more surprising as the movie progressed, was that I never expected it to have any link with the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic and yet there it was, clear as day, how human actions can bring about multiple environmental crisis, including wide-spread and deadly pandemic.This movie had a unique take on the climate change crisis. The solution shown, though a yet unachievable feat, presents enough scientific logic and reasoning to back it up - downsizing of human being to a size of only 12.7 cm, to reduce impact of over-population on the environment by reducing waste and need for mass production, thus saving the planet from mass destruction.The movie starts with this experiment going right. Usually it takes some time in this kind of movies to present such a premise but here they didn't waste time. Reducing the size of everything and creating an alternate world, as I mentioned earlier, was indeed a very interesting plot for a movie. The best part about the movie is that it keeps you captivated throughout. Though you might not get super excited while sitting and watching from your couch, the storyline holds your attention through and through.The storyline opens up so many possibilities. There is such an infinite scope of imagination and creativity with the screenplay that one will never be satisfied, with there being the possibility of so much else and so much more that could have been shown. So, rather than spiraling into this infinite loop of what could have been, it's better to focus on what has been shown, which if you do will enable you to see that a lot has been tried to cover in the short timeframe of 2 hours 15 minutes.The increasing pressure of population on the earth, the boredom in people's lives, hollow relationships, repetitive routines, the brilliance of science and technology and then its limitations as well (mention of pain due to fibromyalgia by Matt Damon's mother) at the very beginning, the movie showcases the great possibilities of human beings and the highest kind of stupidities possible. Here materialism is shown at its best but along with that, kindness and gratitude exhibited at its peak. The makers somehow have managed to keep a great blend of everything in the movie.The movie makes you laugh, keeps you wondering and gives your mind wings as well. It brings out the greed, the fears, the jealousy, the hatred in your mind very effectively but also manages to beautifully touch the kindness, love, peace, joy in you for sure.The imaginative sets of the movie deserve high marks but what will take your breath away are the visuals from Norway. You will fall in love with the place for sure. Nature surely draws you closer to yourself.
The consecutive scenes, wherein at first everyone is shown having a hippie sort of a party in bright daylight with lot of music and dance and then suddenly the scene that follows with a spellbinding sunset enveloped in deep prolonged silence and several peaceful faces just watching the sun set behind the picture perfect mountains, is simply beyond words. The happiness seeking loud minds finding Joy and peace in the silence within.The actors have done a commendable job indeed. Matt Damon's character does not have any sort of greatness to portray and this does not give him a huge scope to perform and yet he carries his role to perfection. But the star of the movie is Hong Chau without any doubt. You will want to hate her through each moment as she shows you that life can be so simple and direct. The simplicity, the ease, the directness of her character is simply brilliant and hence comforting as well as discomforting at the same time.The end of the movie can be debated over. Many possible endings can be thought of but as I said it's better to focus on what happened than what could have happened.You may find a lot of loopholes in the movie, like ones does in life or you can simply decide to wander in this wonderful yet thought provoking journey woven by the storyteller.",Downsizing

convoluted character who is unhappy since he decides early in the movie that he made a mistake being shrunk. After he decides to help a Vietnam refugee the story gets more confusing.

I remembered the trailer and how there had to be funny stuff coming up. I was so jealous of her not watching the next 1.5 hours of the movie and mad that the stuff in the trailer was not in the movie. Some things that made me made were:
1. how come raindrops are small when they are small?
2. how come you can sail fjords and the waves are small?
3. What was the purpose of the trip to Norway? It seemed like a ruse to get Matt Damon out of doing housework. What was the money making deal? Hauling those normal sized bottles behind a tiny boat?
4. Why was having to walk 11 hours enough to make Matt Damon decide not to spend the rest of his life underground?
5. Why did Damon's friend threaten the guy in the bar and get him to back off? Normally in movies, unlike real life, the scenes are selected to tell a story not just a bunch of random events with no connection.
6. If a few miniature people spend 8000 years underground, would they be able to repopulate the earth considering just appearing on a stage required them to be wheeled in by normal people? Would the crocodiles and birds that survived the catastrophe that would wipe out normal sized people not just eat the tiny people?
7. Why did they need to seal the opening of the cave? How are they going to get out? Would not the door be enough?
8. What was the point of the person with cancer? Was getting too many meds and dying a way of supporting euthanasia or was this part of the comedy?
9. Why did the description of pay per view summary say that there was hilarity in the movie?
10. Why did some people like this movie?
11. Why did they have to be shaved? Does the little bit of hair below the skin shrink but the bit sticking out not shrink? 
12. What was the point of the bowel cleansing? Did they really get everything out? How much is okay to stay in? 
13. What if a person had a sliver they did not know about? Dirt under their toenails?
14. I wanted to see the tiny mouse.
15. Who set up the busing system for the people of color to drive them away from the nice parts? How much could it cost to just give them decent housing since they did provide the normal sized television and programming for them.
16. Who fed the poor while Damon was in Norway?

There was literally no narrative, no direction and, thus, no point to the film. Your mind wonders whether this is going to be a sci-fi drama, a spoof comedy, an artistic satire, a political statement on climate change or a commentary on social injustice. Bizarrely, it ends up to be neither. The scriptwriting is all over the place and you care very little for the characters, because of the lack of rational thought or believability. There isn't any goal, conflict or threat during the entire story. Throw in a few racial stereotypes, unimportant characters and crude, foul-mouthed jokes into the mix and this what you receive. Ta da!What made this particular even more painful was that it stretched out to two hours and fifteen minutes. Although I had to disengage my scientific mind going into this (i.e. the issues with gravity, air molecules being too big, virus problems etc) and ignoring the poor obvious green-screening, I soon became self aware of how many people in cinema were dying to get out as much as I was.

477,Moester_,"***Spoilers*** A fairly interesting take on the ""sacrifice for the environment"" debate",6,4 September 2018,"I thought that this movie was fairly blah for the first 70 minutes or. A tale of an under-achiever finding a renewed life after his overly consumerist wife leave him penniless and alone. It had been done better and with more charm many times over the years. In walks Dushan (Christopher Waltz's character), who starts to undermine both the plot and the ""green"" message of the movie. He ""tells the truth"" that Paul (Damon's character) is nice...but not that nice. That he's not at all about the environment, and in the end, he's unhappy not because of his wife or his situation, but his obsession with looking like a nice guy and making a difference.I honestly didn't understand Ngoc Lan as a character until later on in the movie, and in the end its clear that she's the only truly selfless person there. She doesn't try to save the world, she doesn't try to make money, or be celebrated...she just helps people and goes on with her life. Unlike Paul or the scientists of the original colony, she doesn't do it because of moral superiority, but because its what she wants to do. These concepts were brought to life by the introduction of the ""original colony"" first by the sex crazed ""little Ronni"" who is as self-destructive as any child star before him. And then by the both overly optimistic and pessimistic Jorgen Asbjørnsen and the rest of the colony who believe that the world cannot be saved and needs preserved by their insular community. Dushan (ever the opportunist) provides supplies and other goods to them, but has them pegged. ""They're a cult"" is probably the most telling line in the movie, and his assessment of the future destruction of the colony versus the overall fate of humanity is probably the single most accurate assessment of the average ""green utopia"" there is. In the end, people will be people, and they're just as likely to destroy themselves and the environment as the society they are leaving behind. It's like that Vegan person you know that's both proud of their choice and judgmental of yours without any care or realization as to what they're really accomplishing (if anything) or why. In the end, I liked the choice that Paul made; he stopped padding himself on the back, or expecting praise for his actions. The final scene where he drops off food, and runs back out with only a slight look back to ensure that the person he helped was content (as opposed to seeking praise and thanks) was him coming full circle from helping out of obligation and expectation, to helping because it's what he wanted to do.Its hard to rate the movie highly because so much of the plot is useless baggage. His wife leaving him, his odd date, his work at a call center; even the scenes with his mother...they were all needless fluff. How can you rate a movie highly when so much of it is just plain useless? It feels like there were several other potentially interesting narrative threads (like rights of downsized people, and a greater exploration of the abuses of the technology) which were never explored. Because those plot threads were never explored, instead focusing exclusively on the environmental aspects; they could have started the movie right into his first day at Leisureland and explaining that his wife died due to complications of the downsizing process. I felt like the whole divorce angle was too rushed, and served no real purposed other than to impoverish him a little. It seemed like the biggest issue was loneliness rather than cash flow anyways. They could have told the backstory in 5 to 10 minutes of flashback interspersed into the narrative; and boom there's 30 minutes of your life back with a much more interesting story overall.",Downsizing

The trailer essentially summarises the entire first half or so of the movie, while the remaining half becomes almost a political statement, which doesn't always go down well regardless of how well it's exexuted.That being said, it's a better movie than the reviews suggest, but the rating being so low is justified because people do not like being misled. The movies we watch very much depend on our mood at the time, so to set yourself up for a comedy and end up spending 2 hours watching a whole different genre will irk people.

481,rstuff111,"Bold, clever, and non-formulaic movies like these that explore humanity should be lauded",10,18 January 2019,"I liked Downsizing. It really breaks away from the traditional hollywood formula of movies.Warning: below are my thoughts on the movie, and just know there will be spoilers.I think the entire movie was about Matt Damon rediscovering himself after his wife left him. At the end, the world was ending, and Matt Damon had to choose between joining the others down the cave or staying with his friends. The former could potentially lead to preserving humanity after the global disaster, and one could argue that such a task is literally the embodiment of the meaning of life. On the other hand, staying with his new Vietnamese girlfriend and helping the people in their community is honorable, but ultimately meaningless in the grand scheme of things when the world ends and everyone on the surface dies. Yet, Matt chose the latter after long deliberations, an impractical decision through a purely logical standpoint, but the movie frames this in a way that makes it seem sensible to the viewer.Think back to literally the title of the movie: ""downsizing."" Humans are literally portrayed as small compared to the rest of the world, and Matt Damon's bustling society in Happy Valley (or whatever it as called) is just a tiny bubble of life on the planet. When you really think about it, his contributions to helping others, whether it's the dying lady on the Vietnamese girl's bed or the guy in the wheelchair, are downsized compared to the ice caps melting, the climate changing, the forced shrinkage of people in third world countries or whatever. But despite this, Matt Damon still found reason and desire to go back nevertheless.There isn't a clear-cut message in the film, and I think that's a bold move by the writers when the majority of the average film-goers just want to be fed bite-sized, cookie-cut messages (and hence, perhaps why the low reviews). But in my interpretation, the movie is a little combination of both pure entertainment (the film is so refreshingly non-formulaic that you can't guess what happens next) and a reminder that although some of the things we do might not have any real impact in the future, its impact in the present shouldn't be insignificant.",Downsizing

Hong Chau portray the character Vietnamese refugee with credibility and with a mimic that makes Jim Carrey look inadequate 😊
Christoph Waltz and Udo Kier gave the movie some needed quirkyness - in Denmark we have a standup couple making a show of posh wealthy guys with pastel colored polo shirts and sentences like: poor people are boring in a very sarcastic way, Christoph and Udo are the same kind of characters.

The film has a fascinating first act, which reminded me in its look and wit of Albert Brooks' underrated Defending Your Life. Once the hero is downsized, the film loses its magic (and its way), and meanders for another nearly 2 hours to its climax in a fjord in Norway.Matt Damon gives his all in a performance that seems channeled from other actors playing frustrated male characters in Payne's previous films.

So when the movie really puts on the brakes at about 35 minutes in, after the setting is explained, and never again picks up speed, I had trouble staying with it. I'm a fan of Paynes other films but this one can't decide whether it's a soft character study or a cool thought peice.

505,kvnsodak,A poorly marketed masterpiece,9,9 February 2018,"If you're looking for an eco warrior movie you'll be disappointed. If you're looking for a sci fi film, you're partially right. If you want to see a beautiful film about the struggles of a man trying to figure out what his life is really about then you will fall in love with this film. So many have commented that it's 2 films in one and if lost focus. That's not true. Like so many of us Paul (Matt Damon) is trapped in his life. It's not unbearable but it also doesn't bring him much happiness. His wife (Kristen Wiig) Wants to buy a bigger newer house that they can't afford Paul finds himself at a fork in the road. He decides to take the brave step of downsizing himself so that he can give his wife the life of luxury that she desperately wants. From there the film takes a turn. Paul is now face with a new set of circumstances and must adjust, as has happened to most of us at one time or another. That's when Paul starts down the road to discovering what life is really all about. He discovers that life isn't about possessions is about passion. Paul finds his passion in Ngoc Lon who shows Paul that even though his life hasn't turned out the way he expected it to, there is more to the world than just his life. This is a wonderful story, expertly executed about a man coming to terms with his life. If you saw it and disliked it because the trailers mislead you I don't blame you, it was very poorly marketed but see it again in a different frame of mind and you'll love it. This film is in my top 5 and I will see it again.",Downsizing

Then the film narrative is hijacked as if the communist manifesto was cut and pasted into the screenplay for the remainder of the film. The true nature of the film as a propaganda piece was revealed by the clear need to falsely advertise the content and the obvious lack of effort put into maintaining a general plot.Featuring caricatures:
-Racial stereotypes
-White males being either weak and walked over, or just deplorable (unless a 'climatologist' or environmental activist)
-Bad consumerism and capitalism
-Anyone not white being oppressed and/or virtuous (why does an artificially built 'perfect world' have a shanty town built specifically for all the non-white people who only speak Spanish by the way?)
-Enlightened hippie-communes
-Money hungry white women whop show no remorse or empathy
-Bossy and sassy Asian women (but its funny! She's being mean to him haha!)
-Corrupt and sociopathic Slavs
-Drugs being fun and liberating
-Saintly social-democrat Scandinavians
-Someone speaking broken English being the major comedy relief (how adorable!)
-...and lots of dicks! Unnecessary dicks!Clear political propaganda. The producers merely dressed up the Church of Climate Change to look like a cinema, locked the doors once everyone had paid to come in, the beat the audience over the head with their sermon for over 2 hours.Avoid this degenerate propaganda piece.",Downsizing

With a budget of 68 million it's absurd to me that this wasn't addressed during preproduction.All in all, I want my $6 back for renting this. And I don't think I've ever fealt that way about a movie.

Despite the negative reviews I decided to give the film a chance mainly down to the cast including Matt Damon, Christopher Waltz and Jason Sudeikis. All 3 were barely recognizable as they gave nothing towards the film. Even the first 15/20 minutes (by far the best part of the film) were poorly edited and difficult to follow.

I don't know her from anything else, but there's a scene around just after the halfway mark where in the middle of a scene/shot that lasts minutes, she starts to cry. It Blew Me Away. The whole delivery. She could win an Oscar one day. Nay, she almost certainly will. It's an interesting film, maybe I didn't understand it, but I don't think its as smart as the Director thinks.

It follows through many aspects of society and the numerous perspectives of human existence.This is your typical Alexander Payne film with a the slight feeling of a Terry Gilliam Plot line. The immersion is that of a Gullermo del Toro universe and I couldn't help but feel a taste of Spielberg. Pulling from the film styling's of AI and Bicentennial Man. The Zero Theorem also comes to mind and not just because Christopher Waltz is in it.This film made me think. It reminded me of a War Drama or Bio pic where the protagonist goes into a foreign land with fear and doubt, only to find out that there similarities is what binds his love for the people they meet.This is not a great film and there is no strong antagonist which may impact your ability to relate, but it deserves allot more than 5.5 stars. I did not regret watching it and I still feel it had so much more room to explore, but I guess what is not said or explained is also what makes this film great.

Paul Safranek (Matt Damon) believes that he would have a better life if he shrunk himself.
This was the first hour however i simply cannot explain the 2nd half of the film as the story was so messed up, It was hard to see what is going on.Matt Damon was good during most of the film however it did feel that he over acted slightly in the opening 15 minutes. Waltz was great though throughout the film.Overall, this is an original film but poorly executed. There are so many things missing and some characters were poorly introduced and slightly confusing although there are some great Humour which did lift this movie and my rating.

Besides they never explained why there were small Mexican people living outside the dome in extreme poverty. Classic US/Mexico border paradigm. I mean, if they had money to get small, why would they still live in poverty.Last but not least, Jason Sudeikis was part of the cast and you can't go wrong with that guy when it comes to comedy. However he only appeared for a few seconds. Indeed, the scenes you saw him on the trailer are only scenes you will see him in the movie.It was a waste of time and a waste of potential from Hollywood because it could had been a great.PS: It doesn't really have a plot or an end.

Sadly, it took a completely different path, and didn't have enough of what I think the viewer wanted. It needed to depict more of what life being that small would feel like in a big world. Instead we were carried on Paul's journey with him in Leisure Land as a small person all the way through so you never really felt the true perspective of how small he actually was.
There were a lot of inconsistencies...the boat scene in Norway. It felt like normal size. The mountains would have been HUGE. And the fog so much higher. Where were the birds, bugs and flies?
Why was this amazing scene ruined? It should have been immense.
I just wish we could see the film again from the point Paul moves in, and more was made of his conversion to his new wondrous life of being a tiny human. Such a pity as I loved the first 40 minutes.",Downsizing

562,vinicius_coutinho,Alexander Payne back to his best: social satire,8,22 October 2017,"I use to love Alexander Payne's movies (maybe except by About Schmidt), mainly because they are acid in their critics or because they are touching, but what is common to all of them is the great sense of humor. In this movie, Payne goes back to to the social satire that worked so well on his earlier movies (mainly in Election), but here, he expands the scope of his criticism from the American way of life to environment, passing through immigration, consumerism, among other themes. Trying to solve the overpopulation issue, a group of Norwegian scientists creates a way to shrink people to 13 centimeters in order to reduce the consume and the environmental impact that mankind is generating on Earth. ​In front of promise of better life, Paul Safranek (Matt Damon) and his wife Audrey (Kristen Wiig), an average couple, decide to leave behind their stressful life in Omaha and to be shrunk in order to live in miniature community and at the same time being able to have the glamorous life they could never afford in ""real size world"". I must confess that this plot hasn't attracted me at first and if this story was conducted by a less experienced or talented director this might have been a huge disaster. The environmental matter that was supposed to be the main goal of shrink process is soon misrepresented and begins to be used as by average people, whom not having great expectations in real life see in this process a way to achieve their consumerism goals and finally being able to obtain all the material goods they couldn't before (this is due to the fact that their money is multiplied thousands times at the miniature communities). The movie provokes rich debates on where we are heading to as society and if there would be still hope on human being, since it appears that no matter how, we are still trying to take advantage on others.",Downsizing

564,laurenofsteele,What the heck did I just see?,1,28 December 2017,"Having never written a review before, I created an account just so I could warn the users of IMDB to not see this movie. 
I am disappointed on so many levels. First, I am a huge fan of Saturday Night Live and admire Kristen Wiig and Jason's Sudeikis, they were only in the film about 10 minutes. This movie was an entire BATE AND SWITCH, in that they lured you in with a trailer posing as a comedy, yet revealed itself to be a...uhhh...well whatever that was. Not sure how to explain it. Second beef about this film, it is NOTHING LIKE THE TRAILER, and I don't think I am wrong on that. Sure, Matt Damon becomes a little person, but if you're expecting ""Honey I Shrunk the Kids"" or something close to ""Stuck on You"", you will be disappointed. Not once did I laugh. Not once. I smiled when Christoph Waltz did his cute smile, but that was it. What you see in the trailer is a happy, silly movie with that fun song ""Days Go By"", and what you get is a movie with a storyline that cannot keep itself straight, a plot that cannot figure itself out, and several characters the screen writer wants us to care about, but it falls so short that it gets nowhere. It was the first movie since Scanners that I wanted to walk out on. The only reason I didn't walk out was because I wanted to see how it ended, but the ending fell short too. 
I am all for watching a film that's a drama if the trailer sets it up as a drama. Isn't the trailer all about giving the audience a taste of what the movie is supposed to be about? I feel duped and I know others in the theatre felt that way because I saw a lot of people leaving the movie theatre. Yes, THIS IS A MOVIE YOU WILL WALK OUT OF if you cannot handle all of the plot spins and slow spots. 
There are way better movies out there, or just staying at home is a fine choice. Don't see this movie, it's such a downer and has no idea what it even is. The political statements Matt Damon tries to make are making him look like a fool. No one cares about your political agenda, Matt. We just want to be entertained by the actors we know and love.

With this movie, it does not. It seemed as though it couldn't decide which direction to go and ended up just lightly touching on so many things there was never anything of substance. The social and political impact - a few interesting lines and then nothing. The way some things like telemarketing jobs or the Internet would be the same regardless of size, a mention. The intriguing way life would be different for a shrunken person was just barely probed. Even comedic opportunities were bypassed except for a few funny moments. None of the characters had time to develop either. So disappointing.Also, this is a movie where, good or bad, you have to overlook obvious physics or scientific incongruities such as the tiny people still having normal voices, existence of technologies that look normal (a bus, plumbing, even clothing) on a tiny scale with no explanation (whereas some, like cell phones, DID look different in the tiny world.) Also, a miniature boat on a regular lake, yet the waves are not huge. Or the fact that wasps, flies, etc would be deadly predators. If the movie is great, these things can be ignored.

The minute the Downsizing starts, Kristen Wiig, Jason Sudeikis, Neil Patrick Harris, Laura Dern, EVERYONE - cease to appear in the film any further. 
Christoph Waltz is brilliant, and even he couldn't redeem this awful experience for me. 
The new other main character's vietnamese accent is used as comedic relief - making it an awkward, racist attempt at comedy. This movie ran out of ideas FAST, didn't keep a consistent tone, didn't bother researching scale, and gave pitiful attempts at tricking you into thinking it had heart.

Putting big comedy actor names in the trailer will make people suspect this is a comedy, which it isn't. It's not a dramedy either because that word is half comedy, and this movie wasn't. It was more 10% comedy, all squished into the beginning. I bet if they had some really comedic writers this could have been the best movie of 2017. For me, some things would have to change as well though. I liked how the social and environmental aspects were shown to us, but nothing, and I mean nothing was explained. It was all present tense and no backstory unfolded at all. The refugee who came in a TV box was a story of one line long, and we still felt we didn't know anything about it. I say the plot warranted showing some of that story.But my biggest disappointment was the ending. Finally I thought, a man-drone is going for the bigger goal in life: to save humanity.

What about having more money as a small person? I mean they didn't eat the big bread of big people, they produced a small one - the price would be higher if anything..

I'm a bit surprised by the negative reviews and the amount of people that missed the message in the movie. It seems a lot of people went to see a ""Honey I Shrunk the Kids"" type of movie where they wanted to see all the creative ways you could make somebody look small, but this film is about so much more than that. As most have said, after about the first 45 minutes, you've seen most of the moments that make you say, oh wow that's funny, I guess it would be like that if you were small, but after that is where the movie and the message really take off. You're reminded every few scenes that the lead character and his love interest are small, but the story becomes more about appreciating what truly matters rather than material things. The main character initially makes the decision to go small because he thinks having more possessions will make him happier. Once he's shrunk down and he loses something very near and dear to him that truly did make him happy, it destroys him. None of his new riches can make him happy anymore. By the end of the film he finds that happiness again and realizes his mistake. This movie is a bit hippy in thinking and has a lot of eastern philosophy in it which may be unintentionally the reason for the hate.

I found the movie to be really slow in parts but they were keeping up with the concept until the introduced the Vietnamese character. No offence but I couldn't understand a word she said. But, even more than that was the way the movie turned around to become a movie about her character and the way she was helping the homeless and helpless. What has that got to do with downsizing? Nothing. The only thing it says is that there are still all kinds of people in the world regardless of size. But that's not what I signed up for.Also the gratuitous swearing by the woman was a real turn off. I saw kids and an older lady in the cinema and I was just embarrassed with the woman was going on about the different kinds of sex (but using the F-word).

Were they promised something and then got screwed by the rich? Who knows. Wish they had at least attempted to explain that. They talked about the Israelis turning Palestinians small which we are left to assume was against their will ...nice lil jab there btw ;) The other thing that was weird was his 2nd love interest... that didn't seem believable.

She is very unsympathetic, because she treats main protagonist which is Matt Damon horribly. And for no reason Matt Damon(dont remember character name) do everything she says and then out of nowhere he fall in love with her. You would expect that the biggest thing which could make no sense and feel little awkward is the shrinking effect itself. But no! This think really worked. It's the characters relationship that doesn't make sense. Also Matt Damon character didn't build-up over time at all, he still act like simple redneck guy.

This is so much better than I was expecting, the performances are all excellent and the story takes such a beautiful, unexpected turn that it really becomes a cut above. It is refreshing to see an American movie that is not all about CGI or the typical ""make'em laugh"" and wrap it all up in a pretty ribbon.

Why a movie about being shrunk is R is beyond me. This movie was far and away from ""Honey I shrunk the kids"". The plot line seemed to wander off into oblivion. It was unintelligible. And, there was an underlying tone of depression the whole way through. I might call it dry humor, but mostly dark humor. It wasn't funny at all as a matter of fact. There were some hidden political stabs, joke wise. For example, there was a giant wall with mexicans behind it. Case in point is the very beginning. How's this for depression. Once Matt Damon and his Beloved wife get to the shrink factory, Matt parts ways to get shrunken down. Well, after it's all said and done, he is tiny, and his wife is unable to be shrunk for an odd reason. So, he is SOL and so long to his lovely marriage. Maybe she did it on purpose because she's a gold digger. Who with females, yall know how it is these days. Anyhow its all speculation. Next, he arrives at a mansion (since a thimble of material only costs a couple dollars, so he has a mansion now) and he's all alone with his alcohol. The story goes on and it gets worse.

As everyone else has been saying, the trailer is very misleading and if you've seen it, there's no point seeing the whole movie because it's all in the trailer. I felt frustrated in the second half of the film as it just felt like they were filling in to long out the movie. They could have made a whole other movie with the amount of boring, filler shots they could have cut out of this. In short, it just felt like they could have got on with the story a whole lot quicker and it seems like they just got too excited and started running off with a whole new story in the second half which was, to be honest, completely pointless.

Matt Damon really has a lot of fun with it but I didn't feel the shock of the overall reveal of ""downsizing"".I liked the overall concept and how they really thought of how it could be possible to create a lifestyle without any issues but I do think they don't explore it enough as most of the time as they are small I forget because they created a city to there scale so more things that would enhance the concept would've been more appealing to me as a viewer especially when it's the main reason for me watching it.My issues with the film is that the film is very oddly paced with the time jumps and the can often feel like you have missed something especially in a first viewing. The film starts to lose its interest I think half way in as like I said before, nothing indicates that they are small and is too slow of a pacing for the film. I absolutely hated the ending. ""My final words were please don't tell me it's finished"" and then the credits rolled.Overall I like the concept and how the direction with it was to explore humanities Expirience and emotions with the idea and the adjustments of downsizing and it really entertained me with its humour.

Downsizing is a movie with a different notion on how to save the planet. Think, 'Honey, I Shrunk The Kids' but more believable and less laughter. The movie can be a bit slow at times but also very interesting due to the idea of miniaturizing society for environmental/financial gain. Christopher Waltz (Dusan) and Hong Chau (Ngoc Lan Tran) bring both meaning and comedic relief to the movie. I'd say it's worth a watch purely based on the fact that it's a fairly original idea for a film. And No, I would not go small.",Downsizing

Even the largest plot twist was anticlimactic.Throughout I just kept waiting for the point of the story like:
Oh financial troubles will plague this couple throughout the movie and they'll have to overcome that and become a stronger couple...annnd now they're divorced and she's gone.Ah the guy in the bar has an issue with the downsized people! That'll be the issue, overcoming a stigma of big vs small (never mentioned again)-So he'll have to deal with getting over that divorce? (5 minutes later) does he even remember he was ever married?
Wait, this party animal neighbor is probably into some shady stuff that Paul will become a part of and hi-jinx will ensue. No? He's just a normal guy who has many friends? Oh okay.So this Vietnamese housekeeper lives in a secret ""lower class"" village outside the wall...and, of course nothing remotely interesting enough to warrant a big budget movie ever comes of this.At that point I just tuned out realizing that I was over an hour into the movie and there was never going to be an actual problem worthy of a story worth telling. I trudged through the rest, but it was a chore.I give two stars for the visual effects, which were well done for the very few there were. After about 45 minutes into the movie the fact that they were small was a concept that no longer mattered. Everything was shot from the point of view of the characters in a community designed to feel like they were normal size, so everything just looked totally normal.Not sure how this script was ever greenlit.

Next, it blows what would be an amazing premise; people shrink down and no longer contribute to society - the drunk guy at the bar raises great philosophical points, and they could have explored these conflicting ideas. It has the ability to discuss what is society, and what are our duties to one another, to the planet. It blows all of this and then proceeds to beat the audience over the head with this preachy message of white guilt and environmentalism while being insanely long-winded. It's a film devoid of any joy, intrigue, wisdom, insight, humor, or reason for being. It's an insult to its viewers and a cheat in that it sells itself as a humorous look at a what-if world, only to switch it on you for the most pretentious of narratives. Downsizing is the Quinoa of movies. It should be taken out back, beaten to within an inch of its life, lit ablaze, and then shot in the crotch with a rusty screwdriver from a harpoon gun.

Don't waste your time on this movie.The trailer had me a bit intrigued and despite the polarity of the reviews I decided to give it a watch. The film tediously dragged for the first 45 minutes setting up for a whole lot of nothing.Once the downsized world becomes normal to us, we are treated to boring scene after boring scene, with a very liberal agenda, and what ended up being a pretty racist look at a supposed underclass. As many others have pointed out - how the hell is there an underclass in this idyllic world?! When money is worth so much more - how the hell did people end up in slums, dying of basic diseases? They must have been living in a situation impossible amounts worse than a cat litter box in the real world. After an hour it was clear that the film had no identity and had simply made a point of being political and trying to be a social justice warrior without a cause or moral. What could have been a good, clever or funny movie was in fact boring and not even the slightest bit funny or 'satire'.The lead actress who is introduced later in the film ends up being a complete opposite to a paragon of virtue. She is odious, rude, obtuse and she KILLS her closest friend and laughs about it.Matt Damon was boring and as dry as a plank of wood. Guessing he wasn't keen on the film either and probably just cashing in. At the point where he fixes her fake leg, two of my friends decided to leave, 2 minutes later the rest of us walked out too.At least I can say I didn't pay full price.AVOID THIS MOVIE.",Downsizing

In reality their role is purely to set up the larger story. My only criticism is that the first hour of setting up the plot dragged on and presented a false narrative of what the flim was going to be about. Once you get past the first hour you realize the movie is really a drama about love and the end of the world. The film presents the idea that life isn't perfect but you end up with the people who really matter in the end.Many people found Lan's character antagonizing.

The film started of well with showing the benefits of downsizing - getting more for you money and solving the over-populated world problem. I liked the idea that the poor people could now be millionaires and wanted to see what it would be like for them living as riches. I liked the twist that his wife chickened out because it is a big deal going through something that is irreversible. I thought it would be more about showing them starting out in a small world and over-coming tasks and showing the ups and downs of the small world. Maybe showing them within the big world too more often.
Then it starts talking about the environment and the world ending, which is fine as it's a good cause and it does need addressing - just maybe not in a film like this. I think this film should have been more of a comedy and less of a guilt-trip/ real-world problem film.

I was compelled to write a review as a result. The whole premise of the film is very interesting - as with all sci-fi you have to suspend believe to a large extent. The special effects are first class and not overdone - mainly because the film is about the social issues surrounding downsizing and apocalypse. Hong Chau does a great job as does Waltz - somewhat, in my opinion, pushing the lead into the shadows! The pace of the film was just about right - possibly a little slow in the second quarter but it picked up quick enough for me to forget how long I had been in the cinema by the time the end credits appeared!

So yeah, I'll give it that - I'll give it the first 30 minutes. After that, I felt like I was watching two separate movies because it completely ditched the solution - ""downsizing"" and went in a completely different direction.

Now I'm not saying I'm a movie critic, expert or even a IMDB pro but I feel like I should at least be able to understand the premise of this movie.At one point, I looked to my husband who was completely uninterested as he was looking at his phone and said ""I need you to pay attention so maybe you can explain what is happening"".

The ""Down Sizing"" movie we all saw in the trailers ended around 30 minutes into the film; it would have been nice to see where that story could have gone. I think Matt and Kristin could have made a funny film together if it stuck to what the trailers were eluding too. The second story-line, starting about half an hour in, had no relevance to the characters being small. Instead, it jumped from Matt's experimentation with drugs to Global Warming so fast that I found myself in shock that I'm suddenly watching a feature with absolutely no plot.

Instead, we got a directionless, plotless, soulless mess. I cringed for Matt Damon for the duration of that film. I could just about have let it go if he had ended up being the saviour of the poor community outside Leisireland's walls (even though it shouldn't exist with the suggested wealth $1 brings in miniature)...but where did the sudden climate change element come from?!

Okay, let's face the facts. Why has this movies a score of a mere 5,7?
It has all got to do with director Alexander Payne's method and technique. Through his earlier works Payne has proved himself to be one of the most prolific directors when it comes to the conservation and intermediation of humanism and empathy.
The ability to assemble the gears in order to get closer to the characters. Small details and major emotional actions. A skill he shares with legendary filmmakers such as Ettore Scola, Susanne Bier, Richard Linklater and Ken Loach. To name a few.
As a personal evolutionary step, for this title Payne considered not only to further explore sarcasm and comedy. He chose to involve a significant new element to his repertoire - fantasy.
That's where it got tricky. Although the movie starts off as a jocosity, a sarcasm, he takes a sharp turn. More and more, the characters fill the limelight.
This is sadly where the trailer ends (sort of). For Alexander Payne fans, this is actually where the movie really starts.
Halfway through it all takes a slower tempo. From the fantasy/science fiction pace, it becomes more of a character study. All in the hands of Alexander Payne.
As I said. It's a grower! Watch it again. I promise it will pay off.",Downsizing

 I did see the trailer and admit that it promised a somewhat different movie. It is obviously meant to convey a message to the viewer or at least make them think. It portrays all different lifestyle choices and passes silent comment on them. It avoids the usual cliches of mini-humans battling insects or spiders.
Noticeable was that nearly all the characters were everyday as though there was a deliberate attempt to avoid Hollywood glamour and superficiality (except for the party guests who were necessarily glamorous and superficial). Even Matt Damon was portrayed as an ordinary guy and fulfilled that role quite well.
There are gaps in continuity and a couple of head-scratching moments but not to the detriment of the movie, just a sense that it could have been handled better. I wondered if the clumsiness was deliberate to again avoidi Hollywood slickness. 
I inagine that one the credit started rolling, some would be wondering what happened to the rest of the movie. I'll avoid going into more detail as I want to avoid spoilers.

How do you do that Alexander Payne is here to show us. Honestly I don't think he had any idea on how to do that. This film does not know what it really wants to be at all which makes it a real disappointment because I was coming in with high hopes instead turning away completely what the film could have been leaving nothing much to go off on. I was really convinced first in the beginning of the film that there was an interesting story enveloping and after 45 minutes it seemed to drift away completely and the whole idea of the film became something very offbeating and hard to pinpoint. You couldn't even make the determination that they were small people anymore cause everything looked exactly the way it was before so how could we even differentiate between small and big. Where did Kirsten Wiig go after not going through the downsizing process why was that taken out after only seeing about 15 minutes of her and Jason Sudeikis who was barely in it at all which purpose did he serve in it at all. For. Those who have watched the preview it is nothing like the movie and all what might have been intriguing before coming in is really all taken out and the preview did a good job of giving false ideas into coming in. This is definitely Alexander Payne's most unlivable film and since every other film I have seen of his I liked a lot this was a real disappointment especially from a director who has a lot more potential than this.

However, this movie was so bad I felt compelled to express my extreme disappointment. There was so much this movie could have done, and it didn't. Before I go on, let me state that I generally don't care too much for todays comedies because they are immature and raunchy. I am just not into that and I didn't expect this to be one of those movies. While my main go to genre is a good action flix, I also like a good drama that makes you think and even moves you emotionally. The previews and even the first portion of the movie leads you to believe that this will be a decent drama with a good amount of comedy. I thought it would make me laugh and make me think. Unfortunately, there was very little laughing and most of my thinking was about how stupid the movie was. I watched till then end, hoping that something would change and make it all better. It didn't happen. My suggestion is to watch the first 45 minutes or so (just after the divorce) and turn it off. Anything past that point is just stupid. I would also like to point out that while the idea of downsizing a person is unrealistic, it doesn't mean that it the idea couldn't have made for a good SiFi drama with a bit of humor. Of course, in the realm of SiFi genres, you can take an unrealistic idea and make an intelligent movie that is well thought out and executed. Instead, it is like someone with bipolar wrote the first part of the movie and then after some bad drugs, wrote the last part of the movie. In fact, it felt like two completely different movies.

765,ddix1026,Completely Misleading,2,1 June 2018,"From the trailers, this movie (like so many others have mentioned) seemed like a comedy wrapped up in a ""struggle with life"" premise. The truth, however, is that based on the trailers, the movie should have ended after about 30 minutes. What it devolved into was a ham-handed social commentary on the injustices of the world and how environmentally unconscious humanity is. Leaving aside the absurdity of the science (I am OK having to suspend scientific belief for a well done movie, such as Sunshine), the ""message"" of the film dupes just about everyone who walked into the movie expecting to see an amusing movie. The humor stopped half way through the movie and the ONLY ""amusing"" part was the well-acted role of the Vietnamese woman (Hong Chau, take a bow, you were the only plus of the movie, at least in the last half). Swedish hippie communes? Methane bubbles destroying all of the world's atmosphere? Utopian barrios? Come on... If we wanted to watch a movie that shoved social and ecological disaster down our throats, we certainly wouldn't have paid to see what was billed as a comedy. Leaving out what would have probably been the funniest part of the entire movie (Vodka scene) tells me a lot. You pivoted from a funny look at being shrunk and the interaction with the ""big world"" to something Al Gore would have put out. Another reviewer mentioned that this movie was basically An Inconvenient Truth with actors. Unfortunately, this is really not far off from the truth.Sadly, I am not really surprised by this. As much as I think Matt Damon is a good actor (he has shown this in many movies, and I'm not even referring to the bad-ass Jason Bourne), his Stella Artois Water commercial societal campaign shines right through in this movie. I have a feeling that he took this role (originally meant for Paul Giamatti) because of the socio-ecologic theme that Payne was trying to shove down the viewers throats. If you want to watch an agenda filled movie with a couple funny scenes (mainly within the first half of the movie), this may be for you...

Instead I got 2 films jammed together into an overly long mess, with heavy messages that turned this into a real downer.Part I is very promising: the invention of downsizing, creation of the small world, the conversion process. Unfortunately, the minute he enters the small world in Part II he is miserable, so we never get to experience the wonders of being small. Instead, we get class warfare, with all the ""rich"" portrayed as thoughtless consumers who do nothing but leisure activities, attend parties to drink/take drugs, and exploit the poor but noble working class. Interesting how there is no explanation how an entire slum is packed with people in an entirely new world that has only existed for 10 years. It was so heavy-handed the only thing missing was a scene of the desperate underclass selling their organs to survive.In Part III, we suddenly have a tacked-on road trip to visit a cult. Besides moving very, very slowly, the only purpose for this part appeared to be to hammer the climate change message into our heads with a sledgehammer. I kept waiting for Al Gore to appear in a cameo! At the end, our 'hero' ends up right were he was at the end of Part II!

i mean i am really no fan of Matt Daemon. I hardly find any movie of his believable.
But it´s ok, this movie has Kristen Wiig or Jason Suedekis whom i love (she´s pretty mediocre and plays a tiny part only) and the theme and the concept of the (trailer) movie is pretty exciting, it´s been waaay better marketed than what the movie is.
It´s full of actors and actresses that are super uninteresting and sorry to say that that they just don´t look or act like someone in a real major movie, more or less a lot of amateurs probably, which made me wanna say out loud while watching this several times ""well, they definitely downsized the movie-budget too"".
The first half with Suedekis and Wiig is like 7 out of 10, pretty nice, the plot excitingly warms up for the rest of the movie, although this part is also a little too slow, which creates a suspicious feel, and until the moment Daemon will be downsized the movie just turns into a mess, plot holes everywhere, missing links and performances that are not matching a sci-fi-comedy what it probably was supposed to be. IT IS NO COMEDY! It gets to be super depressing from the middle of the story on, and way too undecided on wether it wants to be a global-warming conscious movie that is sensitive on global migration problems and poverty, but then it just way too strikingly bold doing that. We are still trying to laugh cause we just can´t let go of the fact that it is no comedy (though there are NO jokes in this movie), still the boldness of the issues and characters that are appearing are making it all just a crazy mix of a good looking burger that tastes like old sweet potato with broccoli and sweet and sour celery ice-cream.",Downsizing

The concept of downsizing from the very beginning of the movie was about reducing each human's carbon footprint to help slow global warming so I'm not sure why other reviewers felt so misled. The nice thing is that the movie also addressed some of the cons of downsizing from a global economy and political standpoint.

This is a strangely feel-good looming apocalypse movie. Based on the bad reviews I've read here, I suggest not watching the trailer as it is misleading. The film does set off on a more comedic note than it ends but there are funny moments throughout it. The acting is superb - I especially enjoyed Christoph Waltz as a shady, man-of-the-world Serbian smuggler.
The topic of the film, possible repercussions of and solutions to the climate change, seems to pervade many recent films and Alexander Payne managed to give an interesting and beautifully crafted view on it.

786,rex-912-156015,Downsizing,2,25 December 2017,"Imagine the challenge a movie publicist must face when given the task of promoting a motion picture that preaches social orthodoxy, that presents a dystopic present-day condition as reality, and leaves the audience to depart the cinema depressed over the state of humankind. A truthful description of such a film is box office poison. A false image must be cultivated in the minds of prospective movie-goers. If it's The Cider House Rules, you sell it as the inspiring story of a young doctor who devotes his life to care for underprivileged orphans. If it's Downsizing, you film a trailer that depicts it as a light comedy about yuppies making the decision to shrink their bodies to 5 inches in order to enjoy a better life. Your task is to sell tickets; your responsibility has ended there. You don't have to make the audience actually enjoy the movie. The publicity team including Kate Cavendish, Jill R. Fox, Lon Haber, and Lisa Shamata excelled in this task. There are some very good performances among the players supporting Paul, Matt Damon's profoundly uninteresting lead character, including Hong Chau as a Vietnamese housekeeper who becomes a large figure in Paul's life, Christopher Waltz as a playboy neighbor, and Rolf Lassgård as a Norwegian scientist whose work led to the bio-shrinking process. Photography is wonderful in paces, particularly the fjords of Norway. Visual effects are both stunning and realistic, though at times the scale of ""big people"" vs ""small people"" are not entirely consistent from scene to scene. Industrial Light & Magic creates a stunning visual depiction of the Utopian city ""small people"" city of Leisureland. Writer and Director Alexander Payne builds several entertaining scenes during the initial 45 minutes of screen time as Paul's decision to ""go small"" is agonizingly made and carried out. It is in the scrip that Payne and Co-Writer Jim Taylor fail. Indeed, the only entertaining bits are long stretches without any dialogue at all. Starting with a thought-provoking premise, no conflict is introduced into the story for the first 45 minutes, at which time it is revealed that Paul's wife Audrey (Kristen Wiig) reneged on her promise to join Paul in the ""small"" community. She disappears and is never seen again beyond an awkward sight-gag phone call involving one eyebrow. The entire wife character could have been omitted as surplus filler, and probably should have been. Neil Patrick Harris and Laura Dern are similarly wasted as a couple who present a sales pitch for the downsizing process as though it were a time-share. Jason Sudekis walks through as a downsized friend from Paul's high school years. We are asked to believe that the newly-constructed ""small"" Utopian society has been purposely built to include a shantytown to which all the ""ethnics"" (mostly Spanish-speaking) are exiled, just beyond an impenetrable wall, a poorly concealed statement on contemporary politics. By the end, this movie becomes a tale of the End of Days in which we are told it was already too late to save mankind from itself; there was never any hope and we just didn't know it soon enough.Moviegoers may be forgiven for not only disliking this movie, but also being for angry at having been duped into paying money to be shown something entirely different than was advertised. Those who believe that mankind should be punished and exterminated might enjoy this movie. All others should avoid it.",Downsizing

Did they watch the trailer and expect a different thing? This film is great. Here are a couple of reasons why I liked it:The film comes with surprises. In addition to downsizing and the environment, it explores other themes you don't expect at first.It values scientific accuracy. I wouldn't say it's 100% accurate because it's impossible, but unlike many sci-fi blockbusters, it tries to be consistent and realistic. The entire process by which downsizing was invented and the micro-communities formed is carefully explained and seems pretty reasonable to me.Characters are from several different nationalities. The protagonist is American, the inventor is Norwegian, the neighbor is Serbian, and the activist is Vietnamese. It also takes place partly in Norway. I like the cosmopolitan approach in lieu of excessive Americanism.One of the themes it explores is how people can act unexpectedly sometimes. In my opinion, the ending teaches us to look at small things in our lives instead of big ones (what a double entendre!)This film has a unique feel. It's different but interesting.

796,deerave-254-208178,Feeling bamboozeled!,2,4 February 2018,"Like the majority of other reviewers I am disappointed the movie isn't like the trailer. In fact all the scenes from the trailer take place in the first half hour of the movie. The rest steers into a weird message about global warming. Ok I'm down with getting more people on board with eco conservation but that's not what this was advertised as. I would visit Leo Dicaprio's Instagram page if I were looking for that kind of info. 
 Noticeably most of the cast are regular people (non-glam) which is the one good point I can think of. There are more than a few head scratching moments like the weird date with the single mom and how Damon abruptly ends it in a completely rash way segwaying into the next half of the movie which begins to feel like a completely different movie. If you are looking for funny moments: spoiler - there are none. If you are looking for moments showing funny size disproportion : spoiler - the bottle moment from the trailer was cut from the movie. There are two that are memorable ; after surgery with a big cracker and the second is at the end when going to the original small town. Neither are funny or very special. I hoped the movie would go into some real comedy but it never happens. In one scene Damon walks around a fancy mansion and I guess we are supposed to be imagining it's small. There could have been so many funny things with that topic alone. 
The relationship with the Vietnamese woman could be a cute love story on its own in a different movie but here it feels weird. I don't know why I didn't like that part but maybe it had something to do with their strange bantering and literal poverty she lived in. The entire theme takes a different turn to make you hate the excess of American life. We get it. Not everyone is doing their part to help others in this world.

Then comes along the Vietnamese girl, played by Hong Chou, and her horrible accent. Now I realize the actress is actually from Vietnam, however it was one of those accents that make her sound dumb, not to mention how annoying it was to listen to. This is the point in the movie where you're just sitting there and wondering where this movie is going. There wasn't much going on other than her just telling him what to do, and him helping her foot. Which is nice, but just not going anywhere. And then comes the final act. This is what really took me of guard. All of the sudden the movie becomes an end of the world story- I mean if you're gunna tell a story you need to choose a direction, go in that direction, and make it good. This sorta felt like something I would have written in fifth grade: a long stream of consciousness story basically containing I could randomly think of.

Appearantly the movie tried to reach some dramatic climax with the main goal, using a randomly appearing certainty that the human race will destroy itself at some point, is that humans have to ensure their survival because ""obviously humans are the best!"". And of course the only solution to that is the downsizing.This was the point where my feelings of the movie changed from solid boredness to anger of further feeding in the misguided wordviews that alot of people have. In this case combining endless ""progress"" with the ""superiortism"" and ""survival"" of the humans as we know them now, which is just an absurd concept.So while I am not 100% positive that no one will ever enjoy this movie, thus the two stars, anyone who shares any taste of humor with me and/or knows anything about (even popular) science will be very confused about this movies purpuse and will not find this two and half hours enjoyable.",Downsizing

The film had absolutely no storyline, it was lost and it was almost like they planted random scenes in the film just to fill up 2 hours. There was no conflict or action or drama. This had so much potential to be a great film but it just wasn't. There were many plot holes unexplained, for example why he suddenly moved into an apartment instead of living in his downsized mansion.

Matt Damon struggles to make his character believable, but the result is an empty shell. Specifically the attempts at social satire are either fleeting glimpses of obligatory bigotry to drawn out stereotyping designed to insult the intelligence of the audience and the ethnic/socioeconomic groups portrayed. In the end, the writers resorted to stereotypical gutter language in an attempt to add humor to a humorless situation. The closing scene, apparently designed to imply Damon's character found personal validation, actually shows that a doormat will always be a doormat, even if he or she is appreciated by those who walk over them.

But anyway, as I began to watch it, I thought to myself, ""what a brilliant absurdist scenario"". As the movie progressed, however, my focus was shifted to the different issues it explored. The creators must have been confused about the tone and main theme of this movie, but I honestly didn't mind. I got a little bit of comedy, sci-fi, theatre of the absurd, love story, social satire and drama, all in the price of one. The acting was top notch and the dialogue clever. The cinematography was beautiful, especially in the scenes that take place in Norway. I was especially charmed by the Vietnamese actress whose name escapes me at the moment.

It perfectly, ironically, sardonically and ironically (not to mention humorously) presents the modern day conundrum of the privileged bubble world. No one really wants to downsize to save the planet, tho they want everyone to think that's why they are simplifying. At their core, most people still want the most ostentatious things life has to offer, waste and over-consumption be damned. The small people haven't grown simpler or purer in heart, they have let their desires soar and emptiness and lack of altruism is the result. Enter one essentially good, kind man, caught up in a false world on the take but confused as to why he doesn't, as a giver and healer, fit in. His spiritual guide, the Vietnamese protestor, has found the true meaning of life: service to others. She is incorruptible, completely spiritually intact, and a guide and teacher. The depiction of the and days cult was perfect as well: I know so many people who want to change the world, save the planet, attend love and light festivals to dance and drum, but they cant seem to see or help the hungry and homeless people in plain sight. Just loved this movie and the deeper truths it revealed with perfect pitch.",Downsizing

I had my hope high, despite the rating was quite poor. But once the movie started, I had a sense of the direction of the movie going, it wouldn't be great. And boy, I was right. There was barely any development or depth for most of the characters. This movie, it tried to be so much more, more than it can ever hold itself. It was 2h 15mins, and I felt like it was eternal. It was taking itself too seriously. There is not a single laughing scene. It was trying to be scientific, trying to be inspirational, to create awareness, and it was trying too hard it turns out very bad. But the production team, the writing team, they barely have anything scientific knowledge or did any in depth research. The expository scene was all done is dialogues and they are all draggy. It does make me think a little, but the way it was executed was quite boring to be honest. Frankly, I would take the comedic approach for this movie, make a lighthearted film. Focus more on the main character, Paul and explore his backstory (probably begin the movie with his childhood), make the viewers understand his intention, motivation and reasons of action. Exposition would be minimized and done as a news/commercial ads in the film.

885,ddelarueb,A Hard Film to Rate,8,30 July 2018,"Alexander Payne is definitely experimenting with this film. The result is somewhat a mixed bag. The concept is truly great. It is very interesting and it feels half baked once the film is over. This is due to the incredibly ambitious moves Payne chooses to make. Payne chooses to sacrifice some points of view or better introductions into some concepts rather than to dedicate time and smooth out some poor screenwriting decisions. An example is how Payne introduces the voting rights point of view. It is just a random man blurring out exposition. These instances provide some food for thought but are poorly introduced. The thing is that Payne does this so he can save time for other thematic decisions. He chooses to leave the audience wondering on how this idea would actually work. Payne brings up enough points if view to make the audience re-think such an idea would actually be plausible.The problem though, lies in a simple thing: time. A movie with such a concept can't have a decent runtime while still showcasing a very interesting concept as well as developing characters and building a strong story. Payne had the dilemma of choosing to leave some things out and leave others in. This concept would probably serve better in a tv show or in a variety of films. More time would let the film run more smoothly. Payne dedicated time at the beginning and that made it engaging, but as the film progresses, a lot of ideas start being introduces abs be can't help but be left wishing for more.An ending like the one it has was Payne attempting to bring even more to the table but the result is kind of a mess. Payne's very ambitious project succeeds in delivering relevant ideas and themes as well as making a satire on a lot of things on modern society. Where it fails is on trying it all together with strong characters, a well balanced story, and a sharp script that both doesn't feel forced and flows smoothly. I bet if Payne would have had more time, the film would have been flawless. I have to to give the film credit for its ambition, its creativity, and how it a entertaining, but in the long run, there are too many ideas, themes, and criticisms for one to stand out and make an impact. I could only wish for Payne to stick to one and develop it more. This could have easily been solved by taking away that ending and smooth the film out. Overall this was a very ambitious project with a lot of potential, but in order for all that's here to not be a mess, time is needed or things have to be cut. I give Payne credit because I enjoyed the film, I personally liked Hong Chau's character, and its themes were suprisingly interesting. Too bad the film could not speak for itself, develop it's themes, and make an impact on its own. This could have been a great film. I give it a 7.5/10",Downsizing

I feel like unfortunately Matt Damon is now just trying to make money no matter how awful the script is. His last two movies (Suburbicon and now this, Downsizing) have been awful.I watched this movie for free and I still want my money back. It was extremely long, boring, no storyline, no plot. After the first 30 minutes, everything seems 'normal sized' like in any other movie because you are just in the downsized world so everything seems 'normal'. There is no contrast between the real world and the downsized world because they completely stopped showing the real world.I don't know what the point of this movie was. The premise was clever but the execution just wasn't there. Seems like they got a good idea and forgot to write a story.Some things to think about:
If in the real world, your $1 can be $10,000 times, then why are there still 'projects' and extreme poverty stricken people in the downsized world? How did they get $15,000 regular money to get the procedure done only to become downsized and remain in their awful conditions? And if they had even $100 saved up, that would be equivalent to 1 million dollars so why exactly are they so poor?",Downsizing

I left half way through, as there was nothing AT ALL happening that was remotely interesting and asked for my money back. Unfortunately, I gave the movie too long of a chance to redeem itself and past the 30 minute mark where we can receive a refund. Whatever you do, don't see this movie.

Scientists discover a way to shrink humans to reduce the use of resources. Average financially struggling couple decides to downsize. Husband follows through but wife backs out. Husband lands a telemarketer job and regrets his decision to downsize. Goes to a party and gets hungover. Becomes fascinated by a Vietnamese girl who was shrunk by a prison which she was put in for protesting. She has an amputated leg and Paul tries to make it better but breaks it and then becomes the girls assistant for cleaning houses. He helps others and they give food to the poor. Then the two fall in love and go to Norway to the original village. At the original village it is revealed they have a tunnel that can possibly save the world. Paul decides to go into the tunnel to actually do something with his life but then changes his mind because he's in love with the Vietnamese girl.So many time jumps in the story. Matt Damon should have been about 60 when the movie was over!
Trailer misrepresents the movie.
Wish there was more interaction between large humans and downsized humans. Those moments provided comic relief and reminded the audience of the size difference. Most of the movie was only small people, so it appeared normal and was just uninteresting. 
Plot was boring, not enough of Kristen Wiig and Jason Sudeikis, and the movie was just too long and by the time it was over I just wanted to leave and upset I would not get back those 135 minutes.",Downsizing

You could take a dump for 2-1/2 hours, and you're still experiencing something better than watching this atrocity.Maybe Matt Damon lost a bet? Maybe it was a dare? Maybe he has low self-esteem?The story line starts out cute - you're expecting something like Honey, I Shrunk The Kids... which it was (sort of) - and then it got extremely strange. I believe the previews showed all of the parts that showed the contrast between the tall and the small, because the majority of the movie is just a regular little town (think Truman Show Bubble) with their normal sized things.Hong Chau was the best part of the movie (just because she was pretty funny), but not enough for me to change my rating from a 1.I believe there are three story lines in this movie that they tried to cram together, and it ends in a super end of the world cult village that goes down a 2-mile underground tunnel into yet another self-sustaining Truman Show bubble scenario.Bad, Bad, Bad.

908,danielkhooper,Awesome to awful in 1 hour,1,1 January 2018,"Went and saw this movie before reading any reviews. In the first half I was actually really enjoying it and thought this would become a new favourite flick. The idea of the ""downsizing"" was cool, the fantasy story of becoming small and living in a new world with other downsized people and living in big houses and enjoying life, it was great, it had me captivated and was really enjoying the idea and looking forward to what was to become of the second half. Even the cast were well picked and had me anticipating something greater to come.
Then right when the movie was set to go to the next level... it doesnt. in fact it drops multiple levels. goes down a weird path, no longer walking down the fantasy path they could have with the downsizing idea, but instead try to focus solely on this ""save the planet"" message which totally misses the mark. My wife an I actually left with what was probably 15 minutes left of film. It was either wait and find out how it ends (which by that stage we didnt care), or be good parents and get back and pick up the kids from the grand parents. I still havent checked on how it ended.

Paul (Matt Damon) is on a philosophical journey he only gradually recognizes. His desire to downsize may have been precipitated in a midlife crisis.Ngoc (Hong Chou) is a very versatile actress that can berate and cajole and steamrole nearly anyone. As a Vietnamese refugee (both the actress as a baby and the character smuggled in a TV container) she understands one lives or one dies and it is not something one can control.Paul needs a kick in the butt and Ngoc is just the one to give him one when required. The scientific flaws in Downsizing are rampant. The willingness to suspend disbelief is essential.

911,samiscooll,Falls short- Incredibly short,5,24 February 2018,"First off, I don't think that this was a bad film, id say it were just confused about what it was. It had absolutely no direction and the plot just seemed to change every couple minutes. It had about 15 different storylines and bar the first 30 minutes the film was boring, unengaging and completely unremarkable. The whole point and aim of the film, at least from the trailer looked like a fun movie that was about a man shrinking himself, and that's what it was for the first act. I thoroughly enjoyed this part of the film and the whole process of it was fun to watch. The fact that his wife didn't go through with the actual downsizing seemed to me like a good focal point for the rest of the film. I expected the rest of it to be about how he got back on track with his life- Maybe even introduce a new love interest for him to fall in love again. But no. They destroyed the potential of this film by introducing this religious/political agenda that was just odd to me. If you got a man to watch this film without the first 30 minutes they genuinely wouldn't even notice that he'd been downsized or that his wife had left him- that's how little they focused on it and it was ridiculous that impact that it had on his life was not shown at all, his decisions weren't affected, and he just seemed like the same guy at the start. No reference was made to her or the downsizing for the rest of this film and I think that's the crux of the problem for this film- it didn't flow and didn't see chronological at all. You could get the scenes and put them in any order and the film would be the same. One thing doesn't lead to another and it eaves the viewer frustrated and confused as to what the purpose and aim of this film was. Arcs and characters that were instrumental get completely forgotten about and don't have any effect on the rest of the film, I don't even think the wife was mentioned once after the first 30 minutes. If you came to watch this film based on the trailer you'd probably think you were in the wrong cinema, why on earth did they make trailer about the first third of the film then release something different entirely? It was almost like they made two separate things. Now I'm going to address the actual film which again leaves a lot to be desired.The comedy in this film is incredibly lacklustre. I didn't laugh once and neither did the audience.I think the acting in this film isn't that bad, but it does leave a lot to be desired.Matt Damon's character I found very bland and unrelatable from an audience's perspective, his arcs and fully flushed out and the character seems incomplete even at the very end of the film.Many people see Lan Trans character as a beacon in this movie, but I find her incredibly irritating and just doesn't add anything to the experience. I think she has potential to be a good character, but the plot pulls her back- much like everyone else I the movie. I just think she's especially unlikeable.I like the premise for this film and I understand what they were trying to do but it really doesn't work, its poorly executed and the potential in this movie was completely wasted. Its original and I like that- This could have been something amazing but in the end, it falls short. Incredibly short (pun intended)5.6/10",Downsizing

The movie does not follow a logical path. Nothing connects. Characters don't flesh out. There is no climax. There is nothing to look forward to. There is no comedy or drama.

I wanted to walk out halfway through, but thought my family wanted to stay. Afterward, we all admitted we wanted to leave -- if only we had told each other during the movie. No one liked it even a little bit. The first have was just a series of boring, rambling exposition conversations that didn't go anywhere or serve any real purpose. By the second half, the shrinking plot had been abandoned entirely. The movie turned out to actually be about the human race going extinct and a Vietnamese political prisoner trying to repair her foot. Sound weird? It was! But for a movie that ended up being about the end of the world, very little happened, it was unfocused, full of plot holes and worst of all it was dull. It wasn't funny, it wasn't thrilling, it wasn't dramatic, it wasn't emotional, it wasn't romantic.. it was boring. At one point, Matt Damon's character says something along the lines of ""If you told me 5 years ago I'd be five inches tall repairing a Vietnamese dissident's foot and talking to (famous scientist) about human extinction in Norway, I would've said you're crazy."" If that doesn't illustrate what a jumbled mess this movie was, I don't know what would.I've seen some people complain about its preachy message and it being a ""liberal"" movie, but as a bleeding-heart liberal myself, I have to say, that's the least of its problems - it's just a terribly dull movie. The racist stereotypes in this film (the poor neighborhood is all non-white people) don't help.If you saw the trailer and thought, ""Oh this looks like a funny concept"" or ""Hey, Kristen Wiig and Jason Sudekis are in it so it must be funny"" let me set you straight: The shrinking concept takes up only the first 30 minutes of the movie, which is 2 hours and 15 minutes long. Kristen Wiig is on screen for maybe 10 minutes total. Sudekis' role is minor too. This isn't a comedy. You will not laugh.

944,ruiteresmee,It was an okay film,8,10 March 2018,"I like the concept of Downsizing, and its nice that they touch the subject of 'the world is ending', but there are allready so many movies about that. I like it if people can make a cliche idea not that cliche. I didn't really like that 'he choose the girl over his own plan' thing, because you felt that coming. But then again, its a nice movie to watch on a saturday night when you don't want to think to much about finding all the pieces to the puzzle of the movie :).",Downsizing
945,austinpleat,So bad I felt obligated to give my first review,1,11 March 2018,"What the heck happened here? A failure on so many levels. I've watched thousands of movies. This claims a top 5 worst. The commercial couldn't be more misleading. Fifteen minutes in I realized it took an insightful direction but Still had hopes. I thought hey, It could turn itself around. I mean, these 'bigger' issues with humanity are something as a society we should consider and notice. No sir. It was worse and worse and worse. The storyline. The acting. The accents. I mean what was the supporting actress even saying the whole movie? Top 5 worst movie in my life. So bad.",Downsizing
946,navedsir,not what expected,2,13 March 2018,"Movie had a good start. Everything was going nicely. Plot, acting, dialogues. And after 1 hour the movie seems to be completely off track. Didnt enjoy the movie. Could have been much much better.",Downsizing
947,mschiantarelli,Don't expect a slapstick comedy,9,13 March 2018,"A lot of reviewers seem to dislike this film for it not being what it specifically doesn't want to be. Perhaps it was marketed poorly and led to people expect something else. Instead of being a gimmick and a device for creating funny situations, the downsizing aspect is basically just a premise that sets the stage for an original way to look at some of the issues facing the world today.
The movie is funny when it wants to be, but at other times it is also endearing or sad, or gives you something to think about. I liked it, and enjoyed the change in tone at the point where some reviewers say they lost interest, where the focus shifted away from the whole 'how funny it would be if some people were really small' angle.",Downsizing
948,mcsenne,The idea was good,5,20 March 2018,"But poorly executed.

I commend the person that made this trailer. They managed to get every second of Kristin Wiig and Andy Sudakis' screen time in the trailer and trick people into thinking this movie wasn't absolutely awful. Which it was.
To illustrate my point. I have had IMDb on my phone for years and I finally took the time to create a password so that I could warn people about this awful, awful film..
And don't get me started on the Asian female lead's accent!! Wtf!",Downsizing

You keep watching to see what's next, albeit you are probably bored out of your mind at that point. Nothing ever happens, though. Nothing is followed thru on the global warming plot or the demise of mankind or even the ""romance"" for that matter. Terrible.

957,sgoebbel,Much better than expected,10,13 May 2018,"So many people giving this movie a bad review, don't listen to them! This movie is phenomenal. I was expecting what all the people giving bad reviews were expecting, a silly, comedic, over-the-top movie with SNL alum. What I got instead was far better. The movie is still very funny; just with a more intelligent sense of humor. The central message of the movie is not actually an environmental tree-hugger propaganda film, like many have suggested, but instead is a message about growing where you are planted; and about realizing that while some seek to do things that might change and save the world, without being willing to help those around you; what is the point of anything else? This movie is funny, heartwarming and impactful. Those that are hating on it are hating on it because they lack the ability to see the depth of this truly amazing movie. It has made its way into my top 5 movies; I hope it does the same for you.",Downsizing
958,nightdrv-94371,Not as previewed,4,26 August 2018,"So, after seeing the preview, and thinking ""this looks like great fun...
What an interesting concept!""... You watch the movie unfold..... for about 45 minutes or so. And it's all quite good. But then multiple tragedies strike, and the plot is forgotten. Too many mini plotlines (no pun intended) come up, and also disappear, as if none of them ever really mattered. The movie leaves a lot of open speculation, and is rife with problems. Chiefly: It's seemingly distasteful change of direction almost halfway through. I am not pleased with it on any level. Which is sad, because it looked like it could've been a lot of fun.",Downsizing
959,sdburkey,Good start - then downhill fast,2,7 June 2018,"The idea is original and the beginning of the movie was good. After Damon gets downsized, the movie goes downhill. Just plain silly with no direction and of course, the weaving in of the planet ending event caused by global warming. I think the director realized his movie had no substance after the first 1/4 of the movie, so he mixed in all these silly plot lines. Rarely is this case for me, but I couldn't finish the movie.",Downsizing
960,iamsusieq,A waste of a great concept!,3,9 June 2018,"I rarely seek out to give a movie a bad review. The concept of the fictional miniturization (sp) was AWESOME!!! And we enjoyed the first 45 minutes waiting for what would happen next.... then I started drifting off. My husband was glassy eyed, my son went to his room. We retitled it 'A small Vietnam rebel girl'... then 'Matt Damon's climate change agenda'. We would have stopped the horror show but we dug deep for hope it would return to the original plot. Sadly it did not.",Downsizing
961,warwicke,When boring just goes on forever.,2,17 June 2018,It's frustrating when the concept of a movie is really neat but the execution is so poor. There were so many missed opportunities for either humor or drama. Which brings me to my next point. This movie is neither a comedy or a drama. After the first half hour the movie is basically over and they drag it out for a total of 2 hours and fifteen minutes. Save yourself the time and aggravation and watch something else!,Downsizing
962,elysia_lil,Misleading trailer,1,20 June 2018,"The genre of this film is comedy and the trailer looks as though it has potential to be funny but I did not laugh the whole way through the film, some of it was actually quite depressing. 
The trailer shows Kristen Wiig and Jason Sudeikis (big comedy actors - suggesting that the film will be funny) but their combined onscreen time was about 15 minutes.
There wasn't really much of a story - just a sequence of things happening. 
Very disappointing!",Downsizing

I was happy for her that she fell asleep after 15 minutes and I just HAD to see the entire thing hoping it would get better. 
Unfortunately that did not happen. She also bought this one for our teenage kids and will tell them not to watch it. The political agenda and boring dragging scenes without any laughs and just a very annoying Vietnamees girl without many manners didn't do it for me. Also, people downsized. I really gave up at the end when o saw animals downsized (horses and goats). Does that really make sense after seeing what people had to go through to downsize???

I'm sure there were a lot of deeper meanings and comparisons to real world situations in this movie but they went over my head. Christoph Waltz is amazing, he makes any bad movie good, that being said this is probably his first, his character was hillarious! The movie took a huge 180 turn that took them to Norway which came out of nowhere, it went off the rails at that point. I still liked it though, just can't explain it, had to see it through the end. I would recommend because it's a completely different idea which is always entertaining. Also, the female lead character is super annoying and I don't mean Kristen Wigg.",Downsizing

973,aslanslamb,Clever thoughtful film,9,24 September 2018,"For viewers who like exploring interesting concepts, this is your cup of tea. 
The first interest concept is, of course, the downsizing in general. Damon gets transferred to a perfectly comfortable and technologically savvy parallel world, and still, he has to grapple with feeling unimportant. His feeling small in his earlier life, you might say, becomes a literal thing.
The other interesting concept is dealing with the world ending. And it's the least action-y, panicky reaction possible. It's subtle, the way the characters respond, and it really gives the personalities a chance to reveal themselves in a crisis. 
The acting is brilliant. The score is great.
The only possible problem is that the first half is rather slow-paced and takes a long time to provide its' exposition. Not sure how that could have been avoided. It just feels a bit stretched out, and monotonous. 
Once the first half hour is over, you're completely captivated until the end. So give it a chance. 
It's a spectacular film.",Downsizing

The film felt like a mish-mash of unrelated clips with no story or plot connecting them and that lingered on for what seemed as a lifetime. The cast comprised mostly of well know actors who, ether have a random 5 min role or are not presenting their best work, something that can not even be said about the rest of the cast.

That said, it wasn't bad. It wasn't great either although there were several moments of brilliance and some very good performances. (I scored the last 2 stars for the actor's performances only).
The film ambles along. Not knowing how to take it's initial concept to a conclusion, it detours to comedy, social commentary, over to romantic comedy and then back to environmentalism with a pat ending thrown in to show what the main character learned on his journey.
There are times that it hits it's stride and flows, only to suddenly do a slow motion veering off course.
This is a could have been a great film if only it knew what it wanted to be. I'm curious to see what portions stay with me. It may be better or worse with time.",Downsizing
