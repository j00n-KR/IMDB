0,Leofwine_draca,"Not too great, not too bad",5,30 December 2020,"Another day, another Halloween-friendly horror anthology, still made for kids but a little more adult in tone than something like GOOSEBUMPS. This in fact feels a lot like TRICK 'R' TREAT but is nowhere near on the level of that movie, and a lot of the time I felt like I was watching a deliberate STRANGER THINGS imitator. There are five stories collected here, and they're all entirely predictable, with youths or youngsters menaced by various CGI nasties. Killer spiders, scarecrows and madness are the order of the day, the highlight being the scenes in which the gang are harassed by a creepy contorted corpse monster which looks great. The rest is merely okay; I've seen a lot better and I've seen a lot worse, and this sits somewhere in the middle.",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark

They are pursued by bully Tommy Milner after the friends pull a prank on him. They find sanctuary in Ramón Morales' car in the drive-in. Stella leads the group to a haunted house. They escape from scary things including Tommy's revenge. Stella takes an old book from the abandoned house. You don't read the book as much as the book reads you. It belongs to Sarah Bellows who lived a tragic life and died horribly.It's a good in-between horror between the kiddie spooky stories and outright adult gore-fest horrors. I like all the characters. I like the teen actors. I like the spooky and slightly scary stories. I like the idea of the book and the body horrors. The zombie looks good and I expected nothing less from a Guillermo del Toro production. It is not quite an adult horror but it's a good step up from a kiddie campfire story.",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark

On the Halloween night, the trio of friends decide to play a prank on the bully Tommy Milner (Austin Abrams) and flee to a drive-in theater where the stranger Ramón Morales (Michael Garza) hides and protects the teenagers. They decide to spend the night visiting the haunted house of the Bellows family, where Stella finds the book of stories of the notorious Sarah Bellows (Kathleen Pollard). She brings the book home and soon she realizes that Sarah is writing one horror story per day with each one of them and she tries to find a means to stop Sarah.""Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark"" is an entertaining horror film with short stories linked by a lead story with Stella and Ramón. The plot is not gore or scary and disappoints fans of the genre. But if the viewer likes mystery and fantasy films, he or she will certainly enjoy this film.

3,nogodnomasters,We are all going to die,8,24 August 2019,"The film takes place in Mill Valley, Pa. 1968 at Halloween and nearing the Nixon election. Some teens break into a haunted house that belonged to the town founders. There is a story about Sarah Bellows (Kathleen Pollard) an abused child. She was locked in the basement and would tell stories through the wall to children, horror stories that would come true. While in the house, Stella (Zoe Margaret Colletti) swipes a hand written book of the stories, supposedly written in blood. As Stella reads the book, words suddenly appear. . .I like a horror story that is not all jump scares. This one is geared for preteens and is ""family friendly"" considering people die horrible deaths. If someone told me Stephen King wrote it for his kids, I would have believed it.",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark
4,kosmasp,Scared yet?,6,10 March 2020,"Some stories are scary, some are not so scary. The trailer for this suggested a couple of scary things. And if you are not used to horror movies, I reckon this might scare you more than if you have seen your fair share of horror movies, which will make you numb to certain things.This is Hollywood and you should expect certain things (no pun intended). Scares will be thrown in and they will work to a degree. But the cliches and the predictability of it all, make it hard to really care.

5,classicsoncall,"""You don't read the book. The book reads you.""",6,7 January 2020,"Strictly a film for teens about teens caught up in an ancient legend situated in the fictional town of Mill Valley, Pennsylvania. The year is 1968 and the specter of Vietnam and the election of Richard Nixon as President hovers in the background. Some might consider those two events as the scariest thing about the movie, although minor thrills are provided by the appearance of a sadistic scarecrow and a book that writes it's own stories in blood. A trio of teenagers are sacrificed in service to the story as Stella Nichols (Zoe Margaret Colletti) and Ramon Morales (Michael Garza) attempt to locate and confine the source of horror that pervades the small town on this particular Halloween night. The idea behind the 'jangly man' was kind of interesting but the character itself was kind of clunky, utilizing a similar effect that allowed Linda Blair to climb the walls in ""The Exorcist"". The writers seemed to be hinting at some sort of sequel with principal character Stella opining that this story wasn't quite over yet, but if that's the case, the follow up will more than likely deal with zombies from the after life. Or not, one will have to wait and see.",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark
6,lee_eisenberg,the terror is come,10,11 August 2019,"If you came of age in the '80s or '90s, there's a good chance that you read Alvin Schwartz's ""Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark"" trilogy (I read all three books). Schwartz collected assorted spooky folklore into a compendium. But what really made the books memorable was the horrific drawings by Stephen Gammell. I can't describe the illustrations and do justice to them, but that white wolf is sure to haunt you forever.For a couple of years, I envisioned a movie version of Schwartz's books. However, I imagined them as an anthology. Well, a feature film is here, directed by André Øvredal and produced by Guillermo del Toro. While the plot is obviously improbable, the overall gist seems to be that we create the horrors (especially since the 1968 setting means that the specter of Vietnam looms over everything).One fine movie. You're bound to love it. And let's just say that you've never seen ""Bye Bye Birdie"" done like THIS!",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark
7,jboothmillard,Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark,5,1 September 2019,"The trailer for this scary movie looked interesting, it is based on a series of children's book, but this is definitely not for children, whether it would be scary or good was another question, written and produced by Guillermo del Toro (Pan's Labyrinth, The Hobbit Trilogy, The Shape of Water), directed by André Øvredal (Trollhunter). Basically, set in 1968, on Halloween, in the small town of Mill Valley, Pennsylvania, three teenage friends, Stella Nicholls (Zoe Margaret Colletti), August ""Auggie"" Hilderbrandt (Gabriel Rush) and Charlie ""Chuck"" Steinberg (Austin Zajur), play a prank on school bully Tommy Milner (Austin Abrams). Tommy and his gang retaliate and chase them through a drive-in movie, but they are saved by drifter Ramón Morales (Michael Garza). They thank him by taking him with them to a local haunted house which belonged to the Bellows family who helped found the town. Inside, they find a secret room and a book of scary stories belonging to Sarah Bellows, a name that has become legendary in the town, as she famously went insane. Having followed the group, Tommy locks them inside the room along with his girlfriend Ruth (Natalie Ganzhorn), who is also Chuck's sister. They are released by an unseen presence and escape. In her room, Stella discovers that a new story named ""Harold"" is being written in Sarah's book and the main character is Tommy. While a drunken Tommy is delivering food to the neighbours, he is stalked by a scarecrow called Harold, he is stabbed by the creature before vomiting hay and violently transforming while calling for help. Tommy is reported missing the following day. Unsettled, Stella and Ramón investigate and find a scarecrow wearing Tommy's clothes. Stella is convinced that Tommy has been turned into a scarecrow, but the others are sceptical, and Ramón is hesitant to go to the police because of a previous altercation. That night, Stella and Ramón witness a new story being written titled ""The Big Toe"" with August as the main character. The pair attempt to warn Auggie of the threat, while he unwittingly eats the toe, and the living corpse looking for it is stalking him. Auggie tries to escape and then hide, but the corpse drags him under the bed, and he disappears. Terrified and realising they will be next; the group try and fail to destroy the book by burning it. Following this, they decide to research the past of Sarah Bellows to find a way to stop the hauntings. Ruth discovers a large spot on her cheek, a spider bite, at the same time a new story, ""The Red Spot, is written, with her as the main character. Ruth tries to squeeze the spot, but it explodes and releases hundreds of spiders upon her. The group finds her and gets rid of the spiders, and Ruth is taken to the ""nuthouse"" to recover. The group's investigations take them to a psychiatric hospital where they discover Sarah's brother Ephraim was performing electroshock therapy on her to hide the fact that the family's mill had been poisoning the town's water with mercury, killing children. Chuck is attacked by ""The Pale Lady"", an obese phantom from his recurring nightmares. Chuck is cornered by the phantom in a hallway and it absorbs him. Stella and Ramón as too late, as the only thing they find Chuck's pen, they are then arrested by Police Chief Turner (Gil Bellows), who reveals that Ramón has avoided compulsory military service. In their cells, Ramón reveals he skipped the draft as his brother was sent home ""in pieces,"" making him scared of serving in the army. Turner's dog begins to act strangely, and Ramón realises the next creature will be The Jangly Man, a monster from a campfire story that scared him, titled ""Me Tie Dough-ty Walker"". The Jangly Man, able to build itself from body parts, kills Turner before attempting to kill Ramón. Stella and Ramón escape their cells, Ramón tries to lure the creature away while Stella goes to the Bellows house to try to reason with Sarah (Kathleen Pollard). Stella is taken back in time and lives out Sarah's experience as Ephraim terrorises her. Ephraim drags Stella into a dark room, where she encounters Sarah's ghost. In the present, Ramón is hunted by The Jangly Man in the Bellows House. Stella begins tearfully recites the true story of what happened to Sarah Bellows: she was victimized by her family for trying to reveal the truth, which turned her into a rage-filled monster. Sarah used the power of the book to kill her family but was unable to move on and kept killing anyone who removed her book. Stella promises to tell Sarah's real story if she stops killing. Sarah and The Jangly Man vanish after Stella is forced to write her story in the book, in blood. Ruth recovers and Ramón finally drafted into the army, while Stella, still holding Sarah's book, makes a promise to herself that she will find a way to bring Auggie and Chuck back. Also starring Breaking Bad's Dean Norris as Roy Nicholls and Lorraine Toussaint as Lou Lou. It is a simple premise, anyone named in a haunted book becomes the victim of a bizarre and grizzly death that plays on their fears, as detailed in their ""story"", the highlights are the sinister scarecrow character, the ridiculous looking but equally disturbing fat blob thing in the hospital, and the large zit bursting with spiders, this film does rely heavily on attempted jump scares, which are mixed, and I agree that it could have used the 1960s backdrop a bit more, but it's a traditional fright fest, a reasonable horror.

8,Woodyanders,When scary stories come true,8,27 January 2021,"1968. Misfit aspiring writer Stella Nicholls (an excellent performance by Zoe Margaret Colletti) and her oddball friends Auggie Hilderbrant (likeable Gabriel Rush) and Chuck Steinberg (the equally engaging Austin Zajur) discover a book of terrifying tales written by notorious murderess Sarah Bellows. Stella and her friends soon find themselves in great danger when said scary stories start coming true in extremely deadly and horrible ways.Director Andre Overdal relates the enjoyably twisted narrative at a constant pace, expertly crafts a spot-on spooky ooga-booga atmosphere, offers a flavorsome evocation of the 1960's period setting, and stages the scare set pieces with considerable skill and aplomb. This film further benefits from several cool'n'creepy creatures: A lethal scarecrow, an emaciated corpse looking for its missing big toe, a pasty fat ghoul, and, most frightening of all, a marvelously grotesque bendy freak that can detach its limbs and reassemble itself. Better still, the stories smartly tap into deep-seated basic fears that all the characters suffer from and the backstory for Sarah Bellows proves to be surprisingly poignant.The fine acting by the tip-top cast helps a lot: Michael Garza as handsome and charming draft dodger Ramon Morales, Austin Abrams as mean bully Tommy Milner, Gil Bellows as the skeptical Chief Turner, Natalie Ganzhorn as the snippy Ruth, and Lorraine Toussaint as the rattled Lou Lou. Roman Osin's striking widescreen cinematography presents a wondrous wealth of macabre images. The shivery score by Anna Drubich and Marco Beltrami hits the spine-tingling spot. A cracking good horror winner.",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark
9,BA_Harrison,"The title is half right: it is dark, but it isn't scary.",4,21 August 2019,"I knew very little about this film going in and, judging from the title, expected a horror anthology along the lines of Creepshow (1982). What I actually got was a very tired ghost story, one that treads familiar ground and regularly resorts to loud noises to try and make the viewer jump (or in the case of my friend, who fell asleep in the cinema, to wake them up).Based on the books of the same name by Alvin Schwartz, and directed by André Øvredal (Troll Hunter, The Autopsy of Jane Doe), the film follows a small close-knit group of high-school kids (as in Stranger Things and IT) who invoke the wrath of a vengeful ghost when they steal her book of scary stories. Each of the youngsters meets a fate in accordance with one of the stories in the book. The only way to stop the ghost is to unravel the mystery surrounding her death.Øvredal delivers one or two nicely realised creepy creatures along the way (the monsters apparently faithful to the illustrations in Schwartz's books), but the pace is slow, the when the kids investigate the history of the ghost, the film grinds to a halt (which is around the point that my friend dozed off). The whole 'unravelling of the past to put a spirit to rest' idea is as old as the hills, and the film even includes that oft-told urban legend about the girl who has baby spiders burst out of her face (as already seen in 1987 horror The Believers and Urban Legends: Bloody Mary from 2005).4/10.

10,Coventry,Predictable Tricks and Unimaginative Treats...,5,31 October 2021,"Ever since 2007, and year after year on the 31st of October, I've been hoping to stumble upon another great Halloween-themed horror movie like I did in that year with ""Trick 'r Treat"". Alas, though, none of the movies that came since could live up to the greatness of ""Trick 'r Treat""; - not even the ones I had high expectations for, like Patrick Lussier's ""Trick"" or David Gordon Green's update of ""Halloween"". The confidence in this year's film selection was once more very big. And yet again, I've been let down...""Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark"" certainly isn't bad, but I honestly admit I hoped for something much scarier, and for sure for something a lot more original. The only genuinely inventive part is the narrative structure. Like most people, probably, I was set for a traditional sort of horror anthology with separate stories and a wraparound tale to connect the segments. But ""Scary Stories etc..."" is a totally different type of omnibus, with short segments integrated into a full-fledged film. The setting and era are perfect, as the plot takes place in a quiet little town on Halloween's eve in the year 1968. ""Night of the Living Dead"" plays at drive-in theaters, Nixon is getting elected as President, teenagers go out trick-or-treating even though they are too old for it, and the night ends with an illegal trespassing of the local haunted house. The heroic horror-nerds (with names like Stella, Auggie and Chuck) steal a book from a hidden basement in the house, but soon wish they hadn't. The book belonged to a poor girl who got abused and locked up in the cellar by her family, but even a hundred year later she still writes deadly stories.The plot and short stories are shockingly mundane and derivative. I mean, a bully turning into a scarecrow? Spiders crawling out of a beauty queen's face? Getting dragged under the bed by an unseen monster? These things we have seen numerous times before already, but I didn't see any new or innovative aspects at all. Despite the promise in the title, there's aren't any scary moments throughout the film (at least not if you have watched horror before and/or if you're over twelve) and gore or bloodshed is definitely something you shouldn't hope for.",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark

This has one of the better, though still pretty derivative, storylines; and at times can be quite dark, but the use of teenagers as the conduits for the fear just isn't convincing.

The monsters are well rendered and provide good scares, definitely jumped a few times. The acting by the kids is a little lackluster, no depth to their characters and lines are delivered like they are reading them. The first 3/4 of the movie is pretty good, and the plot seems to be moving along fairly nicely. But then the ending comes, and it feels very cheap. It's a very uninspiring ending; a bit of a letdown for what otherwise could have been a decent movie.",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark

SCARY STORIES TO TELL IN THE DARK centers around how this deplorable Pachyderm Party ilk (Real Life archival footage of POTUS ""Tricky Dick Nixon"" is generously sprinkled throughout SCARY STORIES) pervades even the smallest towns in the so-called ""Red States"" (or Hellfire-colored nether regions). Global Warming deniers and Pollution Profiteers such as SCARY STORIES' ""Bellows Family"" eat their own young, in the rare instance when they give birth to a human child with a soul (such as ""Sarah Bellows""). SCARY STORIES documents how these greedy, gluttonous Elephantine ogres contaminate ANYTHING and EVERYONE in their vicinity. This flick holds out little hope for those regions of the USA already tainted by Pachyderm Paranoia. Perhaps it's best to make a fresh start, the ending of SCARY STORIES suggests, and declare this southerly and westerly Land of the Lost to be a ""No Go Zone.""",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark

16,view_and_review,Sarah Tell Me a Story,7,17 August 2019,"I was expecting this movie to be scary like Goosebumps, which is to say not scary at all, but still entertaining. No, this was a legitimate scary movie, complete with chilling build up and grossly mutated creatures that haunt your dreams. With no blood to speak of and nothing in the way of stomach-turning grotesquery this movie was still able to bring the scares.In 1898 or so a girl named Sarah was locked in her family's basement as a punishment. There is where she died, or so the rumor went. After her death if kids would come to the house and say, ""Sarah tell me a story"" she would tell a story that would come true and be the cause of the demise of the recipient.On Halloween 1968 in Mill Valley, Pennsylvania a group of kids went to this now abandoned mansion and Stella (Zoe Margaret Colletti) asked Sarah to tell her a story. As she and her friends found out, the rumors were true-Sarah would tell a story that would come to fruition.This was one of those rare movies for me in which I liked the teenage characters in it. There was the stereotypical bully but none of the other tropes existed. Chuck (Austin Zajur) was probably my favorite character. He was the comic relief and he instantly brought levity to a situation with a simple facial expression.This movie does bring up thoughts of The Ring. This movie's supernatural antagonist was Sarah, The Ring had Samara. Sarah's stories meant the death of an individual, Samara's visions meant the death of an individual. Both were wronged and both continued to torment from the afterlife.I don't want to make it sound like it is just like The Ring because it isn't. I'm just digging through my memory archives to find a similar movie. Scary Stories is its own thing. Though dark and scary it had a touch of lightness to it separating itself from real horrors. It is actually pretty unique. Usually a movie is one or the other: all-in scary or comedic with a scary story. This was scary enough while throttling back at times to give the audience relief.",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark

And those stories come true even as writing appears on the page...This film is apparently taken from a series of books with which I am not familiar. Taken on its own merits, it's not bad. The stories are nicely creepy, the linking device works very well, there's not too much creeping around dark corridors, the teenagers actually look like teenagers, there are a couple of nicely realised monsters, and everything potters along pretty well.If you fancy a bit of mild horror, you could do a lot worse than this.",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark
18,trashgang,mixed feelings,7,11 May 2020,"In fact this is made for the youngsters among us that is clear but being a horror it do offer some moments for those geeks.The story is easy to pick up, Halloween night, visisting an abandoned house pick up a book and things come alive. When nothing scary is happening I found it just on the edge of boring. Youngsters will ove that part, you know, nerdy chick and friends against the tough guys. No, that wasn't my cup of tea but the parts were the book comes alive and the scary stories are happening are really a must see. And naturally, the first story is okay but the last one immediately reminded me of The Thing (1982).So maybe as a family you will enjoy this, checking as an adult your social life while the youngster are enjoying the easy parts and as an adult loving horror you will find the horror the greatest thing.

Not a bad movie which is more geared for kids and Scary Stories is sort of like the It movie. There is the ground work for a small town with teenage characters from 1969 who are bullies, out casts and a stranger from a strange land several states over with a mystery to tell. What works for Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark is the character development which unfolds along with the vengeful spirit story. A old concept, but done in a way which keeps the audience interested. The scares are lame, but the of the late 60's events and what happen in the towns past makes for a good background story which puts the audiences into the story.

Most of the stories were between one to three pages nice short and quick reads. The movie tried yet let down a little bit as it was set with certain kids I wish the film would have been more of an anthology mixed with many tales during the whole movie like something similar to ""Creepshow"", ""Twilight Zone"", ""Tales from the Darkside"" or ""Tales From the Crypt"" instead.Still the movie is watchable as it plays with it's audience in a fairy tale like way set in 1968 at the height of culture change like war, Nixon, and rebellion it follows a group of small teens. As friends they face the normal problems of growing up and fitting in however things change when they find a haunted mansion and a book left by a girl named Sarah and it becomes a haunt to all of their fears. It's just like the stories come aloud and alive and things happen to them one by one it's like they write their chapter and fate in life! The movie has some scary scenes and it tries to sell fright, really it's a mix of drama and black dark comedy.

Always.For a movie that plays homage to SO MANY CLASSICS and still beats its own drum is a movie I will admire for many years to come. In fact, I've put off watching this until the obscene price for streaming came down and even though I found out it's available free on a 2-month-only subscription I recently got a steal for ($0.99/2 months with Showtime - from Prime Day,) I still immediately bought it, after I finished it, for $7.99 on Amazon to OWN.I LOVED this haunted story and not even a fan of ghost tales. In fact, of my top 100 favorite horror movies, it contains an alarming low number of THREE Ghost Stories. (Four when I throw this baby in there next update.) But, since it's so much more than a ghost story and the stakes are as real as they get, I'm fully invested. Hell, even the main theme, ""Season of the Witch"" is sung by one of my all-time favorite artists: Lana Del Rey.I thought this movie was an anthology so when 25-28 minutes of the wraparound/setup was still in progress, I was concerned. Nope, but it is, as the Title insists: STORIES to TELL. Preferably, scary ones. In the dark. Of course. But, that's just a deconstruction.Beautifully, this movie throws multiple storylines, settings and characters at us up front, without confusing any of them and the perfect amount of information is bestowed for us to grasp what our protagonists will eventually feel. Stella, a loner Wednesday-type, her two best buds, a hunky new potential bf and many more are caught within an old witch's curse surrounding a book. This book can predict the victims' demise and maybe, if all the cooks in the kitchen can work together, they can resolve this before...just kidding. There will be conflict. And blood, no doubt.Speaking of which, this is PG-13 and while the blood isn't the lead like in the adult R-Rated films, the scares in this movie were unique and actually WAY more effective than if it had been a Rated-R film's gorefest. This is like the Terminator being ordered Not to Kill by John and having to spend the entire movie being creative with multiple workarounds. It did it perfectly.To add to everything else, including a beautifully shot movie, very realistic characters/motivations/emotions and a well-established and haunting mood, we have incredibly good-looking leads: Michael Garza (""Ramon"") and Austin Zajur (""Chuck."") Don't worry, they're both of age. Ha. As always, the people playing teens are older. But, I was absolutely certain throughout Zajur was also the school bully in Halloween (2007.) I was incorrect, though they're not too far off in age.I digress. If you have a subscription to Showtime, see this movie NOW. If not, just buy it for $7.99. Hundred percent worth it and maybe you'll be telling your own scary stories in the dark.Who knows? They may hurt or heal.***Final thoughts: Wish I had seen this as a young adult or younger. I know I'd rank this so high on my top 100 list and cherish it for the remainder of my life like other horror classics like Halloween, Child's Play, Sleepaway Camp, Any Friday/Nightmare film and Final Destination. Just to name a few scarier...and sentimental stories to me.",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark

24,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Scary stories to tell teenagers.,6,25 August 2019,"'Scary Stories To Tell In The Dark (2019)' feels very familiar. In fact, it's almost like we've seen this exact film before. This is probably because it sticks incredibly closely to the conventions of its genre and, even more likely, because it's pretty much 'Goosebumps (2015)' aimed at teens instead of tweens. This is true right down to its 'books as canon' conceit, yet it never seems as though it's simply trying to ape that much tamer title. Perhaps the similarities were entirely accidental, perhaps not; I suppose, it doesn't really matter. To be fair, this is probably the most successful of the two. Its absolute 'ace in the hole' is its creature design, which elevate the otherwise humdrum horror. This calibre of creature is honestly hard to come by, usually reserved for the genre's (R-rated) 'cream of the crop'. The actual scares are sort of split into two categories: interestingly reserved suspense and overtly annoying 'jumps'. These two elements, thankfully, kind of cancel each other out, with the former reducing the often irritating effect of the latter and, even, sometimes making them feel worthwhile. The music is the only thing that makes the jump-scares work, though, which makes them formulaic, predictable and, actually, kind of cheap. The interesting visuals and restrained build-ups, as well as the overall assured direction, give off the impression that these could have been done much better. Luckily, there's only one 'false scare' and, as I mentioned, the general suspense tends to make up for them - well, that and the fantastic creature design. The story has real stakes and is paced fairly well, with little time wasted. The experience does feel a bit long, though, and it drags a little in the middle, despite being relatively tight. It's often fairly exciting but it's never edge-of-your-seat engaging. The characters are all well-rounded and believable enough, filling their roles as well as can be expected. Essentially, you care about the core players just enough to hope they make it through their individualised set-piece. On the whole, the movie is a little generic and it's not particularly scary. However, it has a good bit of grit and a dash of charm, to boot. I can see it acting as a decent 'gateway horror' for teenage genre-newbies - although, most will probably have seen tougher fair by now. Either way, it's pretty enjoyable throughout. 6/10",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark
25,ThomasDrufke,"""The Book Reads Us""",7,24 August 2019,"It's very difficult to make a genuinely scary movie these days, and even harder to do it without an R rating. Somehow, Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark was able to succeed in making a PG-13 film unsettling and at times, terrifying. I'm not going to sit here and say the film should win any Oscars for acting or screenplay, because both seemed to be seriously lacking, but the direction was solid and makeup/practical effects were some of the most impressive I've seen in the last 5 years. I've seen many people call this film 'It: Light', and that's not an unfair comparison. It deals with a group of young people fighting to stay alive when their worst fears begin to terrorize them through monter form. But if you can scare me and make me cringe in my seat, I think you've succeeded in horror.7.6/10",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark

It would have been better just to leave them separate and flesh them out a little, drawing out the tension in each.I liked the attempt to bring in the 1968/Nixon/Vietnam stuff, but it just came across as awkward.The characters are all pretty stock, giving the film a packaged feeling.The scene with Stella and Sarah towards the end is in particular forced and weak (""that's on you"" ...ugh, an eight year old could have written this)Overall comes across as pretty standard stuff.

It is obvious that this movie was made on the heels of ""It"" and ""Stranger Things"" success. I didn't watch any trailers, nor even read synopsis before going to this movie, so i wasn't excepting anything. But i can say, without going into plot details and spoiling anything, that this movie is like the ones you already saw many times. Plot, story, characters, situations weren't even slight original. Does this make it a bad movie? No. And this movie isn't bad one, but for me it wasn't scary a bit and felt very familiar and highly predictable. When the character is being chased by a big CGI monster - this is not a good sign for a scary horror movie.Overall, ""Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark"" was a disappointing horror flick for me.

Initially, I thought it would be short segments, like 'Tales from the Crypt'.'Scary stories to tell in the dark' is essentially a slasher movie, but this is a unique and interesting way of telling a slasher story - similar to 'Final Destination'. It is a really good, intriguing story, with characters I care about. The acting from the young cast is also very good. The visuals are excellent and creepy, and the film is unpredictable. The Jangly Man is a hideous, scary creature that reminded me of a creature from John Carpenter's 'The Thing'.The back story was equally captivating. This was a joy to watch from beginning to end. I predict 'Scary stories to tell in the dark' will become a classic in the vein of 'Scream', 'I know what you did last summer' and 'Children of the Corn'.

36,cruise01,Scary stories delivers a fun nostalgic horror movie.,8,15 August 2019,"Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark (4 out of 5 stars).Scary Stories is like a darker, serious, and scarier version of a Goosebumps movie. It has a fun setting taking place in the 1960s, a fun direction that builds some suspense and thrills and a good 1960s soundtrack. The plot following a group of teens who are haunted by a book that writes itself with scary stories that comes to life. It is a fun, scary horror film that is definitely worth checking out.The plot follows Stella (Zoe Colletti) and her two friends Chuck (Austin Zajur) and Auggie (Gabriel Rush) going out trick or treating. While preparing to get even with the town's bully Tommy (Austin Abrams). They escape and run into a haunted deserted house. Stella finds a book with scary stories. The following day, one page writes itself with one of the teens that went in the house with a scary story coming to life.The plot was good. And creepy. There is more to the story about when they come across the book. The book belonging to Sarah Bellows who was mistreated by her greedy family. By locking her up in the basement. The stories that does come to life. They are all creepy and scary in a way. Tommy coming across a scarecrow called Harold. Creepy looking and when it comes to life. And he is running for his life in a corn crop field. Makes you hesitant about walking through a corn maze now. Then, there is a big toe story of a corpse looking for their toe. Looks like an undead zombie chasing the person. The pale lady one is creepy and spine chilling. As the character tries to escape the corridors but every turn he makes he runs into a slow walking pale lady. The jangly man is the scariest. A man that reattaches his limps which is quite menacing.Zoe Colletti, Gabriel Rush, and Austin Zajur were all good. Michael Garza playing Ramone who is a stranger to the small town. But Stella befriends with him. The direction does create suspense and thrills. There is some brief moments when it slows down to build the story. But when the book writes itself and the characters lives are at stake with these hauntings. It is scary and creepy. There are moments were the director tries to be unpredictable with its jump scares. A character peaks and you expect something. That build up suspense makes you feel edgy.I have never read the short stories based on the books. I did like how they incorporated those short stories into one movie that focuses on a haunted book that creates the persons fear that is out to get them. Overall, Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark is a good horror film. The direction may have some slow moments but it is worth the wait when those stories comes alive. The suspense and thrills will leave you on the edge. The cast was great. The concept and setting was fun with making it feel like a nostalgic horror movie.",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark
37,eddie_baggins,Scarily bad,1,19 February 2020,"Tell me a scary story I hear you ask.Well you're in luck dear reader as I have a very scary story to tell you indeed!The type of story that will leave you with shivers down your spine, this is a tale of how an Oscar winning heavyweight used his industry prowess to reimagine Alvin Schwartz's famous set of horrific tales into one downright atrocious feature length offering.Getting credit as both producer and story by, beloved Mexican director Guillermo del Toro has backed in André Øvredal (the man behind the brilliant Troll Hunters and The Autopsy of Jane Doe) to be the man to bring Schwartz's tales to life, as they amalgamate a collection of his dastardly yarns into one feature length experience that will surely make you believe evil in this world does indeed exist.Going the pg-13 (M rated in Australia) route, Stories looked to tap into the teenager centred horror marketplace, as we follow a bunch of annoying high-schoolers over a Halloween period in a small American town in the Nixon era of the late 1960's as they come into possession of a nasty little book that sees its readers become the victims of its bloodthirsty tales.A daft plot no doubt but also one that could've been a guilty pleasure done right, Stories instead makes you wish that you to could become a participant of the book in question and be dispatched in a relatively painless way before you have too witness another second of Austin Zajur's Razzie worthy acting or Øvredal stumbling around another failed jump scare.Filled with brief moments of horror goodness, a hospital set-piece or a corn field escapade the standouts, Stories fails to inspire any type of audience reaction or engagement as it trudges along its way, held back by its target audience limitations and uninspired delivery.It's truly scary to believe that such talented members of the filmmaking community thought that this final product was one worthy of public consumption, although some dark magic seems to have been present concerning this piece, dark juju that somehow managed to see this tripe turn a profit, get some decent critical reactions and set itself up for a sequel that I'm sure will be just as generic and forgettable as what has come before it.It goes to show dear reader that we live in a day and age where anything and everything can and will be made, but be wary as watching such pieces of ""film"" like Stories will slowly but surely zap your will to be a living and breathing cinemagoer.Final Say -Squandering a potentially fun opportunity to bring Schwartz's famed series back into spotlight, Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark is neither scary, imaginative or interesting enough to warrant your valuable time.

38,matthewssilverhammer,Should've Been an Anthology,6,16 August 2019,"Scary Stories is so close to a near-perfect introduction to true terror for younger kids. The kid-centered cast, the episodic format, the meta-nature of horror storytelling. Unfortunately, despite its great conceit (teens find a book that writes its own horror tales that end up coming true), Scary Stories is not only too violently dark for younger viewers, it's also just not that great. Existing somewhere between anthology film and single narrative, it settles for being a barely convincing, strung-together collection of inventive (if undeniably spooky) death scenes that would've been served better as a collection of short stories.
Where the film soars is in its individual, smaller monster stories, specifically in the creature creations. Producer Guillermo del Toro is notoriously great with horror visuals, and you see his influence clearly. The hulking scarecrow, the spider infestation, the unspeakably creepy overweight hospital patient; these are all the makings of disgusting and wonderful nightmares. The script tying these parts together is, sadly, much less effective. Slow-paced and drawn-out nothingness is mistaken for actual tension, potential plot devices are clumsily thrown aside, horror cliches abound (how many contorted CGI-bodies do we really need?), and our heroes run the range between one-dimensional and just plain boring.
I will say, however, that the ending helps shed some light on the purpose of the larger story. We wrestle with the futility of fighting fate, and even how we as a culture turn our own victims into monsters, who then create more victims, a message that's especially prescient. I certainly wish the story leading to those moments was less sloppy, but it's still nice to get horror movie more interested in curious disturbia than cheap jump scares.",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark
39,southdavid,Harold And Bored,4,5 September 2019,"Took a bit of a chance investing my time in ""Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark"", the trailer wasn't particularly promising, some fairly generic horror tropes and ""mild peril"". However, the presence of Guillermo Del Toro as a Producer and Screenwriter convinced me to give it a try. Unfortunately, despite the odd moment, I should have stuck with my initial instincts.On Halloween Night, Five teenagers investigate their town's haunted house - decades previously populated by the Bellows family, and in particularly their daughter Sarah, who, legend has it, used to read scary stories to the local children who then disappeared. In the sealed basement they discover a book of Sarah's stories but, to their horror, discover that the book is adding new stories each night, stories that come true, stories about them.There are a few problems with the film, but the first and most obvious is one of tone. It's difficult to work out what audience this film is for. It's too probably too scary for most younger teenagers but the plot is too basic for the older teenagers/adults to get much from it. It's not quite a portmanteau type horror film, but each individual story produces a threat or monster unique to those few scenes and those are interwoven into the overriding plot, of Stella Nichols, played nicely by Zoe Margaret Colletti, trying to discover the truth about the Bellows family and save her friends from their written fates. The stories are a mixed bag, some are a little unnerving, whilst others are a bit baffling - if anything. There are a few jump scares, but very little beyond that to cause genuine dread.The effects are generally OK. Some (but not all) of the CGI ones are better than the practical efforts, performances are fine, art direction, historical recreation all perfectly acceptable - it's all just a little lacking in invention though and that's true of the story. It doesn't need to be ""Scream"" levels of self-referential, but a little knowing humour (or just humour in general) might have helped. The ending is a little underwhelming too, and then the sequel baiting final scenes feel desperate.Too competent to actively hate but not one that will live long in the memory.",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark

Some where in-between Goosebumps and A Nightmare on Elm Street lies Scary Stories, a movie that looks like it's for children but some of the hunting is a little too real. Although, if this was made in the 80s the hard PG-13 would make more sense but now it seems confusing to me.

The central motif of a haunted story book, which writes stories that come true before the eyes of the characters, takes too long to be introduced.

This is a horror movie that is based on a series of books written in the 1980's and Guillermo del Toro produced and helped write the screenplay for it. It's set in 1968, involving teens enjoying that great time of year, Halloween. Zoe is feeling like it's her fault that her mother left her and the family-it wasn't. Dean, her dad, even tells her so, but you know teens. They can be moody. Anyway, Zoe and her closest friends run into the new teen in town, Michael, and they all decide to go to a haunted house-it is Halloween. They find a book belonging to a girl that died in the house and that's when things get interesting. They do something you should never do in these movies, take the book home-you should always leave things like that were you found them. The book has stories in it that were written by the dead girl and now, the book-or the dead girl-starts writing new stories that become real and threatening to the teens. Gil is the local policeman that of course, doesn't believe the teens stories, until it's too late. Then, it doesn't matter if he believes them or not. The creatures look interesting and quite bizzaro. I particularly liked the one that was in separate pieces and reassembled himself into ....well, you just have to see it.

46,parry_na,Family friendly horror ...,6,4 March 2020,"As Disney films increase their grip on cinema, there have been a few horror movies that seem to have adopted a kind of Disney-esque style. Nothing wrong with that. In fact, the idea of a family-friendly horror film has its merits. It all depends on what the viewer is looking for.Guillermo Del Toro has proven himself to be very talented in producing the kind of filmic stories that straddle audiences - fusing a child-like fairytale whimsy with truly dark scenarios and creatures. His involvement here is fairly evident regarding that style, and there are many moments that you can imagine a youngster being comforted by the presence of parents who are also enjoying the frights.Among the talented actors here, Zoe Colletti as Sheila Nichols proves to be the star of the show. Funny, brave, mischievous but never bratty, she carries the weight of the various set-pieces very convincingly - when she is scared, you know there's in trouble in store. Equally, the various monsters impress during their (too) brief screen time. There are some imaginative nightmare characters: possibly my favourite is 'the Pale Lady', a lackadaisical obese creature with long dank hair. Only on screen a few moments, she nevertheless makes an impression.
This might not thrill those who are after something more genuinely frightening, but as a chiller designed to appeal to most ages, I'd say this does its job. My score is 6 out of 10.",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark

51,kirbylee70-599-526179,FROM BOOKS TO FILM,8,17 December 2019,"Horror fiction for teens became a big item back in the 90s with the release of the books by author R.L. Stine. His GOOSEBUMPS books were huge sellers. But eleven years before the first of those appeared another series of books captured the imaginations of children and were a must have item on their bookshelves. Those books, SCARY STORIES TO TELL IN THE DARK, by author Stephen Gammell were a quite popular and still sell to this day.The basis for Gammell's stories were a combination of folklore and urban legends to create original tales meant to terrify young readers. For the longest time fans hope that these stories would be used to inspire a new series of films. Finally their requests have been answered. The books have been turned into a film and that is new to disc as of now.Rather than use an anthology setup for the stories the movie instead uses a central theme and it works perfectly. The year is 1968 and set in the small town of Mill Valley, PA. Friends Stella (Zoe Margaret Colletti), Augie (Gabriel Rush) and Chuck (Austin Zajur) are the outcasts, the kids everyone tend to pick on. This Halloween they want revenge and play a prank on school bully Tommy Milner (Austin Abrams). When he chases them down they sneak into the local drive in and pop into the car of Ramon Morales (Michael Garza). Before Tommy can do them damage the drive-in owner kicks him out.Looking for something to do and to return the favor to Ramon the three tell him about a haunted house in the area, once owned by the Bellows family. The story is that young Sarah Bellows was locked away in a hidden room and would write scary stories in her own blood, reading the tales to those who would sit outside her room. Checking out the house they find the secret room, something no one else has ever done, and the book that Sarah wrote her stories in. Stella takes the book and they return to Ramon's car only to find that Tommy has damaged it.Stella offers Ramon the couch in her basement to stay on until his car is repaired. Going to her room she begins to look through the books and finds blank pages near the back. But those pages begin to fill up before her eyes, handwriting in blood that scribbles away while she watches. A story called ""Harold"" is being written and while it unfolds before her eyes, we see the story actually taking place with Tommy as the scarecrow he took out his frustrations on begins tracking him down, eventually turning him into a scarecrow as well.When Tommy is reported missing the next day Stella shares the story with her three friends. They go to Tommy's and find a scarecrow with his letter jacket on but no Tommy. Stella is convinced this is Tommy but her friends not quite so much.That night she watches with Ramon as another story begins to write itself. This one involves a big toe found in a stew. She calls Chuck to join her and Ramon and they race to Auggie's house realizing that he is the next target. Unfortunately they arrive too late.The next day the final three try to destroy the book only to find it's impossible to do so. With that knowledge they decide that there must be a story behind the book that no one really knows. They begin to look into the truth behind Sarah Bellows and what happened to her. Hopefully that knowledge can be used to stop the book from writing more stories before they are all gone.The movie is a fun filled adventure that both adults and children can enjoy. It helps that director Guillermo Del Toro produced the film as he's a big fan of the books. The use of a story that connects the short tales in the book works perfectly here and creates a path that makes sense for each story to follow. Images from the books themselves were used to create the monsters in the film and they look as creepy here as they did in those books.The film is well made with great performances by its young cast as well as the adults on hand. Many scenes take place in the dark but never so dark you can't see what's happening, a problem with many horror films these days. The movie will provide plenty of scares for young viewers and might not be best seen by the far younger ones. That's something that each parent will have to determine. But pre-teens will have a blast with this one and can watch alongside their folks, waiting to see which of them will jump first.",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark

Love the characters, the setting, the scary mansion, the PHENOMENAL cast, dont get the low 6 score. Its incredibly hard to make a scary or horror movie great that's a pg 13 but films like this and the quiet place 1 and 2 pull it off. I would have given it a solid 8 to 8.5 but kicked it up to a 10 to offset the ridiculous 6 score.

53,kluseba,Horror movie to be watched by young teenagers,6,3 September 2019,"Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark is an entertaining but shallow horror movie aimed at teenage audiences in the key of It. Based upon the novels by Alvin Schwartz, the movie revolves around anthologic horror stories that make your worst nightmares come true. The teenagers who mistakenly kickstarted the curse by discovering an old book in an abandoned mansion must find out more about its writer in order to make the horrors stop.On the positive side, the different creatures seen throughout the film are intriguing, diversified and creative which makes for an entertaining experience. The back story around a psychologically and physically assaulted girl that keeps the whole movie together is actually interesting and even moving to a certain degree. The appropriate settings blend in very well and bring the late sixties in the United States of America to life in an authentic manner. The characters are easy to empathize with and especially lead actress Zoe Colletti underlines her reputation as one of the greatest young actresses to be around these days.On the negative side, the film isn't really scary as the atmosphere never goes beyond mildly gloomy. This might be appropriate for young teenagers but older teenagers or adults could quickly get bored. The style of this movie is closely inspired by It and fails to develop its own idnetity. The film's ending isn't satisfactory as several questions remain unanswered which could hint at a possible sequel. The movie however doesn't have the depth to become a franchise.In the end, Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark is an entertaining horror movie to be watched at your local cinema with your friends if you like the genre and are between twelve and sixteen years old. The movie certainly doesn't reinvent the genre and fails to develop its own identity. The movie is good enough to be watched once but fails to leave a deeper impression.",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark
54,Pairic,Haunted House Horror Mystery,8,21 August 2019,"Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark: Halloween, a Haunted house, teenagers fleeing bullies, sounds familiar but the story by Guillermo del Toro adds some extra spice. Dybbuk style spirits possess and shape shift their victims. A Scarecrow comes to life, pitchforks a bully and then transforms him. A teen is dragged into a wall by a revenant seeking it's big toe. A strange storybook writes new tales which ensnares the victim's of a vindictive ghost. Eerie shot of corridors which become threatening in bright light, even more so in flashing red alarm lights with a Momo style character approaching. Time shifts take place and a 19th century mystery has to be solved. Entertaining but at times I feel the other screenwriters were put in to restrain the del Toro influence and make this more teen than adult horror. This may also have hampered director André Øvredal so Scary Stories doesn't reach the terror levels/darkness of his previous films The Autopsy of Jane Doe or Trollhunter. Still it's well worth watching. 7.5/10.",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark

For some, this film might not make u difficult to sleep, although some disturbing scenes might be quiet disturbing.

Oh and of course it's Halloween so the nerds go to some abandoned house subject of some horror legend about a girl that tells horror stories to kids who then disappear and the fate of the girl is also uncertain. In any case, strange things happen once the kids get there. One of them sees this story-telling girl. Another finds the book of stories.Later one of the bullies falls victim to one of these horror stories that starts writing itself in the book. Then the book goes after our nerds. At some point it seems like it's using their fears against them, but it's not consistent in that regard. As the kids see the stories of their deaths write themselves they have to figure out a way to stop whatever is going on and save themselves which will involve investigating the fate of the girl.Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark is one slow, long, and dull teen horror movie. I'm not sure it would even appeal to young teens. None of the characters is particularly interesting and the attempt to give this movie some political depth is pathetic.

57,masonfisk,NEEDED TO BE BETTER...!,4,21 August 2019,"Guillermo del Toro's produced horror flick released a couple of weeks ago. Directed by André Øvredal (Trollhunter/The Autopsy of Jane Doe) this by the numbers affair takes place during the late sixties in a sleepy burg on Halloween. A trio of misfits have just taken revenge against some school bullies (bags of poo play a large part in their plot) but when the aggrieved malcontents chase them to a haunted house of legend (joined by a fourth young man, a Chicano draft dodger who helped them elude capture at a drive-in), the girl of the group (who fancies herself a writer) stumbles upon a book from the crazed previous scion of the family who died under mysterious circumstances. Deaths start to mount as stories begin appearing on the book's blank pages (in fresh blood no less) as the ghost exacts revenge on the living. Although the film gets points for evoking a time & place & some interesting creature design, same points are taken away as we're bombarded by typical scares (quiet, quiet, quiet...loud music cue!) & characters who's scarce wits have eluded them when the monsters come a-calling. Del Toro should take the brunt of the blame here since it makes no sense his own directed films never traipse along these tired tropes yet his produced output does ( I had the same problems w/his Don't Be Afraid of the Dark from about a decade ago).

59,peterp-450-298716,I really liked this neat little ghost-story.,6,20 October 2019,"You don't read the book.
The book reads you.A few years ago there was already the movie ""Goosebumps"", based on the stories of R.L. Stine, with the not so funny Jack Black. The only thing I can remember about this film is that an immense amount of figures from that book series were used to make life miserable for the protagonists. Fortunately the film ""Scary stories to tell in the dark"" doesn't make the same mistake. This film is based on an iconic series of stories of the same name written by Alvin Schwartz. A series of three bundles, full of scary horror short stories about dark revenge and supernatural events. Books that caused a stir among concerned parents who felt that these stories (and especially the lurid illustrations) weren't suitable for young children. Well, that's something that arouses my curiosity.I myself was a big fan of television horror series such as ""The Hitchhiker"", ""Tales from the crypt"" and ""The Twilight Zone"" in the 80s. Short stories with a sinister undertone and a scary story. In short, horror for beginners. The same kind of stories are being used in this film. The movie won't scare a hardcore horror-fan though. It's all too soft. It's clear that they aimed at a slightly younger teenage audience. A perfect movie for adolescent boys to watch with their first girlfriend. Hoping that the lovely girl will be so scared to death that she'll snuggle close to him seeking protection in his arms.A big name in the film world, Guillermo Del Toro, is a fan of the original ""Scary Stories"" stories as well and has therefore contributed to this film by working on the script. That means that my expectations were high. The result is a well-cared-for ghost story with a hugely successful 60s setting. Subtle horror with fragments of intense moments. You could clearly feel the influence of the grandmaster himself. Of course, it's once again situated during the Halloween festivities. The cause of all the misery may not be called earth-shatteringly original. And the way in which the problem is solved is perhaps dull. That means that ""Scary stories to tell in the dark"" nestles itself in the range of horror films that don't exceed the average. But that doesn't mean that you should avoid this film. There are too many positive things to discover for that.First the acting of the youthful cast. They didn't do so bad. The gang of teenagers to which Stella (Zoe Margaret Coletti) belongs is as usual a collection of personalities with their own distinctive traits. First of all, you have Stella's best friends. The phlegmatic Auggie (Gabriel Rush) and scatterbrain Chuck (Austin Zajur). Then you have Tommy (Austin ""Paper Towns"" Abrams) the chief bully of the village. A good-for-nothing guy who joins the army to fight in Vietnam and who's actually the cause of the teenagers ending up in the haunted house where Sarah Bellows lived. The only people who accompany them as well are Ramon Morales (Michael Garza), a Mexican boy who tries to avoid something, and Chuck's sister Ruth (Natalie Ganzhorn). These persons are the ones who, after Stella has discovered a lurid book full of horror stories, become victims of their own fears. Personally, I thought the acting performance of Zoe Margaret Coletti and Tommy Miller were the most successful.Like I said before, the horror moments aren't terrifying. But ""Harold"" the scarecrow, ""The Big Toe"" and ""Jangly Man"" were the most amusing moments from the series of creeps that showed up. Really such figures that would fit perfectly in a Stephen King's collection of short stories. And the way the stories manifest themselves in the book was also a nice touch. And finally, I thought the overall atmosphere this film bathed in, was wonderful to see. Oh well, maybe the fact that Stella is portrayed as a misfit and her personal torments about a mother who left the family, was a bit too corny. And in terms of shock effects, it also fell short. However, if you like an entertaining and well-told ghost story, then this ""Scary Stories to tell in the dark"" is perfect for you.More reviews here: movie-freak.be",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark
60,aidanratesmovies,"Feels like a missed opportunity, but better than expected",4,8 December 2019,"Although it proves to be more than just another ""Goosebumps"" like horror adaptation, Scary Stories doesn't do too much to prove that it's worth the time. The film's pacing is truly its biggest flaw, by proving to be somewhat interesting at times, and messy and dull at others. The acting varies from decent to mediocre, and no actor but Zoe Margaret Colletti seems to show any sort of star power. The script is kinda formulaic and at times messy, but can prove to be decently entertaining at times, despite the plot often being on the nose. The look of the film is pretty good, with its 60's style making for some compelling moments, even when proving to be somewhat interesting. The CGI used for the 'monsters' in the film for the most part does make for some creepy moments the film had being trying to go for, but at times the film seems to rely on them less for suspense and more for jump scares. In the end, Scary Stories is hardly a necessary film to watch for 2019, but it does prove to be better than expected at times, and even though some ideas seem like a missed opportunity for a different and darker film, it does prove to hold together to be enjoyable enough in the long run.

61,questl-18592,Underwhelming Stories to Tell in the Dark,6,13 February 2020,"After watching this two and a half times, I think this is going to perpetually fall into the category of movies I don't particularly like but I appreciate what it's trying to do. Scary Stories feels like it's trying to be a horror movie for a younger audience and that's a market that feels like it's always been underdeveloped and mismanaged. Every now and then a movie comes out to try and scare the bejesus out of kids but usually they default to quirky and fun with gothic overtones.So, while I don't personally enjoy the gross out horror and the sometimes cheesy effects, I think they are perfect for the target audience. Still, before showing this to kids it may be wise to watch it first and make sure it's right for them but if you're looking for some family friendly scares, this probably fits the bill.",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark

63,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Solid Adaptation of Childhood Books!,9,17 August 2019,"When I heard that Guillermo del Toro was involved in bringing these series of books to life, I was definitely intrigued. I'm actually thinking this is one of my first forays into reading horror and this was a staple of my childhood. It was a race to check these out in both of the elementary school libraries that I attended. It wasn't until my sister bought the trilogy that I actually got the chance to read them cover to cover. It's been quite a while since I did so. The synopsis for the movie is a group of teens face their fears to save their lives.We get a pretty solid introduction to all of the characters and the setting of the film. It is a small town in Pennsylvania back in 1968. There's a backdrop here of Richard Nixon trying to get the Republican nomination and that seems to be the buzz around the town. Our main character is Stella Nicholls (Zoe Margaret Colletti). She lives with her father and she wants to become a writer. Her best friends are Auggie Hilderbrandt (Gabriel Rush) who is kind of a hopeless romantic for any girl that will show interest. Their other friend is Chuck Steinberg (Austin Zajur). His has an older sister, Ruth (Natalie Ganzhorn) who is quite attractive and into theater. It is Halloween and the two guys have to convince Stella to come out as they have a prank planned.The era is interesting, because it is in the middle of the Vietnam War and the draft is a scary, looming thing. A young man Ramón (Michael Garza) is passing through, keeping up with the crops that are being picked. The local sheriff, Chief Turner (Gil Bellows) asks him about what's he up to and I got a vibe of racism here.There is also a local bully, Tommy (Austin Abrams) who lives on a farm. He doesn't like their scarecrow, named Harold. He traumatizes the group of kids that we are following. He's the one they're trying to get their revenge on, which leads them to meeting Ramón. It's at the drive-in and he protects them from Tommy. Stella takes a liking to Ramón and invites him to a local haunted house. It is there we the back-story of the town and one of its founding families. There's a local legend about Sarah Bellows (Kathleen Pollard). Stella discovers her book and asks her to tell her a story. The problem is that this awakens a vengeful spirit that starts to punish them for what they've done.I have to lead of here stating that I really like what they did by adapting this to the screen. As I said that I grew up with these books, it is really fun to hear the title of some of my favorite stories and also getting to see some of them brought to life here. There's a really dark story here if I'm going to be honest and that is something I really appreciated it.Going beyond that though, there is really a deeper story here that I really liked. The background of the Bellows family and how it comes into play of the film. Sarah had some kind of condition and she lived in 1898, so I could literally see a family hiding her away like they did. Since there were burnings of witches and things like that, it really does make sense. The backdrop of Nixon as well is something I really like. I think the idea of corruption is a social commentary and how much the townspeople here are embracing it. I also personally think it is also looking at our nation and it's current place as well.There was something else here that I caught on to with Stella and Sarah. Sarah is telling her scary stories and it is killing people. Stella wants to be a writer and she is really into horror. The duality of the two is interesting and something that happens during the climax was interesting. I almost wished they would have gone a step farther though. There's a very cool scene where we hear a recording of Sarah and she is telling something that is of events happening. They didn't do the cop out I thought they were moving toward, but it seems like it could if they decide to go with a sequel. There's so many stories that a sequel or a prequel could happen if it is successful enough.To move to the pacing of the film, I was surprised to see that it had a running time of almost 2 hours. That did kind of worry me, but to be honest, it is a non-factor. The movie doesn't waste any time getting into it and really moves from event to event. I really liked how that happened. I do think we get a bit of catering to a younger audience, but it is nothing that hurt the film for me. The movie does build tension throughout. I did like the climax and how everything plays out in the end. As I said, it felt like it was gearing to something I didn't want to have happen, but it didn't go there thankfully. It is fitting that this was co-written and produced by del Toro, because we do get that dark fairy tale vibe he is known for.I want to move to my thoughts on the acting here. Colletti was pretty solid as the lead. I really like that she is into horror and that she wants to be a writer. It really made me see some of myself in her character, which helps when you can connect like that. There's deeper trauma there that her mother left while she is young and she blames herself. It brings darkness to the character. Garza is solid as well. There is an interesting politic aspect to the film with him and I also think is solid to see him dealing with racism that was accepted back then. I don't like how his character ends at the film, but it makes sense with the breaking the circle of corruption. Rush and Zajur are solid, especially Zajur as he brings some comedy to the film. I did like seeing Norris and Bellows in their roles. I also thought that Abrams brings a villainous character to the film where his comeuppance was fitting. The rest of the cast rounded out the film for what was needed.Something I was worried about coming into this film was the effects. I knew that they were going to go CGI, but to be honest, it wasn't an issue. They did it for the most part in a way that looked pretty realistic. Not all of it, but some of this feels like a nightmare so I'm more forgiving in cases like that. I thought the look of Sarah was good, especially because they hide her for a lot of it. I will always say that just give me a little, because my imagination will probably scare me more than what they can do. It was also shot very well. There were some interesting camera angles and POVs that really worked in building tension as well.The last thing to cover would be the soundtrack. I thought to be honest it was fitting. It didn't really stand out to me aside from kicking the film off with the song 'Season of the Witch', which being set on Halloween is great. They also finish the film with a cover of it, which I also liked. The rest of it really did fit the scenes and helped to build the necessary tension.Now with that said, I really enjoyed this film. I thought that they did a good job in bringing these stories to life and meshing them together with a pretty dark back-story. There is an interesting aspect here with the social commentary of the time period as well as bringing up issues that are still plaguing the country today. I thought despite its running time that it built the necessary tension, which the soundtrack definitely helped there as well. The acting was pretty solid and I thought that even though they went with CGI mostly, it still looked good to me. There would only be slight issues. I thought this was a good film overall and would definitely recommend this if you're a fan of the books or even if you don't necessarily like horror films.",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark

65,jadepietro,Fright Lite,7,11 August 2019,"GRADE: B-THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: An uneven but entertaining spookfest.JIM'S REVIEW: Back in the eighties, Alvin Schwartz's YA horror anthology of folktales and urban legends, Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark, became a huge success among teenagers and a controversy with strict uptight constipated parents. The iconic ink illustrations by Stephen Gammell gave this trilogy a cult status as adults readily tried to ban these books from school and public libraries deeming these short stories too intense for young minds. Censorship versus that Footloose mentality, the novels became the equivalent of literary rock n' roll, a sign of rebellion and coming-of-age. Today, one looks at these quaint eerie tales and sees just how mild and sedate they actually were, especially compared to the grisly and bloody goings-on in today's literature.This screen adaptation by Dan and Kevin Hageman pays homage to these stories and gives them the same mild and sedate treatment. Rated PG-13, the filmmakers target a new generation of young audiences. Out of the nearly thirty short stories from the first book, they select six of the best scary stories to create those goosebumps. Stringing these tales together in the sketchiest of outlines that barely resemble a plot, director André Øvredal makes his movie into a period piece of nostalgia, sets the events in the turbulent late 60's, and intertwines these tales with a group of teenagers that begins one Halloween night in the fictional town of Mill Valley, PA.The convoluting premise: By eluding some bullies, a Scooby-doo gang of high-schoolers escape and find themselves in the old Bellows House, the town's haunted house where evil spirits lurk. It is there that they discover an ancient book written in blood (what else?) by one of the previous tenants. This contrivance leads them and the moviegoing audience through each of the selected supernatural tales from Schwartz's novels. (Yes, I know you heard this all before and may have seen most of this kinda set-up in many TV shows, but you got to start somewhere, right?) So bring on Jangly Man, The Toe Monster, Harold the Scarecrow and The Pale Lady for your macabre-lite fix.Some of the storylines resonant; others do not. This happens when the story and the storytelling become uneven and far too predictable. Rather than becoming the coherent thread to connect the spooky folktales, this transitional plot device zaps most of the well-built tension from the scary story sequences which are the heart of the film. One wishes more time was spent on the actual original sextet than trying to make the film a cohesive whole. When the film detours off course from its formulaic plotting, it zeroes in on its more compelling tales of woe before veering back to the established conventional story-within-a-story format.Still, one must commend Mr. Øvredal for providing enough suspense within the limits of the film rating. This restriction actually forces him to be more creative and inventive with the fear factor by eliminating the excessive gore found in most of the horror genre nowadays. The CGI is well done and there are some nice surreal touches throughout the film. Plus, there are some well earned thrills in most of these tales of horror. (Credit goes to Roman Osin's atmospheric cinematography and Guillermo del Toro, who is one of the producers. Mr. del Toro's producer stamp of approval and his signature style is very evident with much of the film's grotesque creatures that roam the night hours.)The young cast includes Zoe Colletti and Michael Garza as the central love interest, Gabriel Rush and Austin Zajur as the sidekicks, and Natalie Ganzhorn and Austin Abrams as Victim 1 and Victim 3. Reliable veteran actors Dan Norris, Gil Bellows, and Lorraine Toussaint also populate the film. The characters are paper-thin and mere props for the creepy happenings, but all of the actors acquit themselves nicely from the serviceable material.Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark is sure to have its eventual sequels in the coming years. After all, the original source trilogy has nearly 100 possibilities to chose for future movie treatments. Hopefully, those films will be diverting fun as well and have enough genuine scary moments as its first installment in what promises to be a successful movie series for both youngsters and oldsters.

SUMMARYLet's finish this up. Summarizing the review, Scary Stories certainly is a tale to tell in the dark, or the theater in this case. It's a good tale that tributes back to the 90s horror decade, with a narrative that binds so many things together to make you laugh and potentially jump. I liked the balance a lot and the diversity of the creatures and means to which our ""heroes"" are trying to solve the legendary mystery. Yet, the film still does not have quite the bite and scare factor for this reviewer (remember desensitized) and I would have liked a little more of it and the narrative put in and finding a way to break the mold on the predictability. Nevertheless, this is one of the better horror tales that I have seen in a long time, and as I said give it a shot in the theater.My scores are:Horror/Mystery/Thriller: 7.5

When I first saw this advertised, I had never heard of the books on which it is based and from the trailer I couldn't figure out who the audience for this story might be. From the trailer I felt it was aimed at young teenagers but then some of the imagery used on screen seemed so terrifying and disturbing i thought it couldn't possibly be. Well it turns out it is aimed at teenagers and if i was a teenager watching this i would probably have loved it. As an adult i did still enjoy it, the horror elements were done brilliantly, scary, disturbing and memorable. It's the bits in between the horror that let it down slightly.

The scarecrow that made the bully a scarecrow in the cornfield was really good. Then there's the toe stew which was pretty gross and sucked one of them into the wall with itself from under the bed. Then the best monster of the film comes which is the bloated lady at the hospital. She devoured Chuck while others were listening to a phonograph (like in Crimson Peak). A monster came for Ramon at the station when he was under custody with Stella. It was able to dismember and put together himself. They got back to the haunted house where Stella became Sarah in the past (Haunting of Hill House used the same thing) and the ruined house became a mansion again. They locked her down in the basement where she convinced Sarah of letting them go. They both survived and Stella wrote stories telling how innocent Sarah was unlike her greedy parents.Vietnam war and the elections in the background, it told a story along the lines of other movies by Del Toro all of which I really like and this one isn't an exception.

It is just too damn long.
This takes time to build up back story with a bully and some love interest before you even get to your first spooky encounter.
Then it rolls and rolls.

77,rockman182,Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark(2019),7,11 August 2019,"I read the collection of stories this film is based on earlier this year (all three volumes) and its a very memorable read. The illustration and the profound effect of some of the short stories; its no wonder why a film based on these stories was made. I see that they went with a structured linear story with the events based on the book happening to the main core of characters. A perfectly fine approach. There are dull moments here and there but overall its a good teen horror with some very memorable monster imagery.The film is about a group of friends that go to a haunted house on Halloween and find a book based on scary stories that the troubled girl who used to live there wrote. The protagonist of the film brings the book back with her and soon realizes that the book writes live stories about her friends. These stories occur in real life and her friends start dying one by one. She must figure out how to stop these terrible events from happening and understand the dark mystery of the books owner.The film doesn't utilize what I think are the best stories in the book but the creation of the monsters from some of them was remarkable. Its unnerving and creepy at times. The films main core story and characters do get dull and boring at times which makes you crave the more horrific moments. When they come they deliver. The film is quite clearly marketed at the younger audience but has enough good scares to make it a fun experience.As an adaptation of a popular book this works fine, which is refreshing. Its not a perfect film and could have been better but for what we get there a re a few great memorable scenes. This could very well be a Halloween time staple for some although probably not for me. Id say it gets the job done and captures some of the mystery, imagery, and intrigue that makes the book so special.7/10",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark
78,RforFilm,Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark works when it tells it's short stories; the larger story is disjointed,6,15 August 2019,"If there's something that can define the childhood of those that grew up in the 80's or 90's, is that they were filled with a lot of dark and scary stories. We had animated movies like The Secret of NIMH and An American Tale, we had live action movies like The Witches and Return to Oz, and we even had books like the Goosebumps series. Though I don't have a reason why this era was the highpoint for dark children's stories, there is an idea that we forget just how much children can take. After all, they play violent video games and still make believe about zombies and monsters.One such book I remember reading was ""Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark"". Unlike the Goosebumps books which were more like tamed episodes of The Twilight Zone, ""Scary Stories"" not only had more unnerving urban legends, but the illustrations were grotesque and seemed like something out of a nightmare. I myself found the images so scary I refused to read them before bedtime. Their black and white drawings of body parts and scarecrows have made the book controversial and have made it even more desirable for older children. So let see if the movie Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark can bring back an old nightmare.Set within the 1960s, a group of teenagers are getting ready for a Halloween night of trick or treating; aspiring writer Stella (played by Zoe Colletti), Augie (played by Gabriel Rush) and Chuck (played by Austin Zajur). They pull a prank on a school bully and escape into a drive-in where they hide in the car of a loner teen Ramón (played by Michael Garza). They all go explore a local house that's rumored to be haunted. Stella finds a secret room where she discovers a book of ""Scary Stories"" written by Sarah Bellows, the previous tenet of the house.When she gets home, she reads a scarecrow story called ""Harold"". She and Ramón discover that the not only has the same bully gone missing, but see a suspicious scarecrow that resembles the one she read about. They dismiss it as a coincidence until she then reads ""The Big Toe"" and realizes that Chuck's name is in it. Other stories like ""The Red Spot"", ""The Pale Lady"" and ""Me Tie Dough-ty Walker"" reveal their names as the kids race against the clock from these monsters coming to killing them.It might seem easy to compare Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark to Goosebumps from 2015. There are some big differences. First, there's actual intention to scare as the monsters here are absolutely terrifying. I don't want to spoil much, but based on what I remember from my childhood, it feels like they took exactly what was drawn and given them a three dimensional design that I'm sure will induce new nightmares. Plus unlike Goosebumps, which tried to be more whimsical, Scary Stories is unnerving... and I mean that in a good way.Does that mean that Scary Stories is flawless? I can't say that. Whenever it does retell the short stories, the movie is great and does give me that jitter that I felt when I was nine. When the movie tells it main story, it has some trouble. I'm not sure if there was script issues or if something was lost in editing, because there are a lot of moments where characters side plots and even personality quirks seem to come and go for no reason. There's a moment where a character worries about a red room again, even though I don't remember if he brought it up before.I'm torn because the movie is great is parts, but has a lot of filler your not interested in while your waiting for the stories to start. It's a lot like an anthology movie, like Creepshow, but with a plot that tries to connect them, similar to Heavy Metal. Is it as disjointed as Heavy Metal? No. In fact, even it's larger story seems fascinating. I realty want to know how much was cut out as I have a feeling that much was trimmed in order to make it more family friendly.I'll give this six books of Scary Stories out of ten. I can see this being a fun Halloween staple (why they put this out in August? Who knows) regardless and I can even admit to likely watching it again because of that. It'll certainly be satisfying for adults and older kids. As for younger kids, I'd say those over ten, but even they need to at least be mature. Give it a watch and see the beauty of the shorts against a larger weaker story.",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark
79,Anurag-Shetty,Surpasses most of the recent horror movies.,8,10 August 2019,"Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark is based on the book series of the same name by Alvin Schwartz. It tells the story of a gang of teenagers namely, Stella Nicholls(Zoe Margaret Colletti), Ramon Morales(Michael Garza), Auggie Hilderbrandt(Gabriel Rush) & Chuck Steinberg(Austin Zajur). Stella, Ramon, Auggie & Chuck, explore an abandoned house & have to contend with something sinister & supernatural.Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark is a great film. Director Andre Overdal has perfected the eerie yet hauntingly magnificent Gothic visuals that were staples in Guillermo del Toro's previous horror productions, Mama(2013) & Crimson Peak(2015), as well. This is a horror movie, that even teenagers can watch. So, there are not too many jump scares or genuinely terrifying scenes. However, the creepy atmosphere of the film has been maintained throughout & there are some unnerving set pieces. Zoe Margaret Colletti is spectacular as Stella Nicholls. Michael Garza is superb as Ramon Morales. Gabriel Rush is good as Auggie Hilderbrandt. Austin Zajur is outstanding as Chuck Steinberg. Austin Abrams is brilliant as Tommy. Natalie Ganzhorn is amazing as Ruth. Dean Norris is awesome as Roy Nicholls. The supporting cast is fantastic. Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark is worth a watch.

A step up from fair like Goosebumps but not quite to the level (in intensity, gore and violence) of a ""real"" Horror film like HEREDITY, PARANORMAL ACTIVITY or the SAW franchise - and that just might be it's downfall for it is stuck in a very narrow band of viewers who will enjoy this (too intense for younger kids, to ""kidd-ish"" for teenagers and above).And that's too bad, for SCARY STORIES is a pretty well put together film. Telling...well...a series of scary stories that come true (to the detriment of the teens that these stories are written about).Based on the YA series of novels of the same name, Director Andre Overdal stitches together (in some instances quite literally) a creepy (enough) tale of teens in danger by things that go bump into the night. There are good (enough) scares, some real (enough) spine-tingling chills and just (enough) death and destruction to keep things interesting.And that's good for the cast is pretty bland. Zoe Margaret Coletti, Michael Garza, Gabriel Rush and Austin Zajur are ""fine"" (but interchangeable) as the 4 teens caught in the crossfire of these stories. Their performances/characters are almost good enough to sustain things, but, ultimately, brought nothing new or interesting to their roles. Neither do Lorraine Toussaint, Gil Bellows and Dean Norris, 3 usually dependable actors that just sort of drift in and out of this film with not much to do.But that doesn't really matter for the special effects, scares and story threads are what you are there to see and the special effects are good (enough), the scares are scary (enough) and the story is just interesting (enough) to let you have a decent (enough) time at the theater.Letter Grade: B-6 Stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark

83,bob-the-movie-man,Surprisingly entertaining.,7,8 September 2019,"To my surprise, this movie was not what I was expecting at all. From the title, I was sure I'd see a portmanteau movie of unconnected short stories, similar to 1983's ""Twilight Zone: The Movie"". But with a kid-centric plot and set in a small American town, the formula is similar to ""It"" or ""Super 8"". However, the episodic nature of serial ""incidents"" aligns it more with the style of the ""Final Destination"" films.Stella Nicholls (Zoe Margaret Colletti) is a horror geek and aspiring writer living in Mill Valley, a small Pennsylvanian town during the Nixon election of 1968. Stella has a couple of friends: the requisite Scoobie Doo Shaggy character Chuck (Austin Zajur) and the 'sensible' ""it's all science"" character Auggie (Gabriel Rush). But pursued by local hoodlum Tommy (Austin Abrams), Stella, Chuck and Auggie are thrown together with draft-dodging outsider Ramón (Michael Garza).They escape into the local spooky house - a house where legend has it that terrible things were done to a strange albini girl, Sarah. That legend has it that Sarah used to tell local kids scary stories through the walls. And Stella finds a book... a book that appears to be unfinished....This is a time when horror films are either ""old school"" or more psychological in nature (like ""Hereditary""). This one has Guillermo del Toro's hand behind that of lead-writers Dan and Kevin Hagerman. And it's firmly old-school. There are some effective (but at times comically created) spooky moments that are scary without being hugely gory. This earns it a UK15, rather than a UK18, certificate. It's disappointing that doesn't stretch to 12A to attract a younger teenage audience, since the source material is actually from a ""Goosebumps""-like set of short stories by Alvin Schwartz.The story's 'episodes' are nicely varied. At the gross-out end of the scale is an episode with Chuck's sister Ruth (Natalie Ganzhorn) that might get arachnophobes running for the exits. My personal favourite? A 'red room' episode with the oncoming fate comically arriving in slow-motion like the steam-roller in ""Austin Powers""!This is another film that relies on the quality of its young cast, with the only moderately well-know cast name being Gil Bellows as the local sheriff. In this regard, the stand-out performance is that of Zoe Margaret Colletti who does a fabulous job as Stella. She's been in a few films in the past (""Annie"", ""Wildlife"" and ""Skin"") but this is her breakout performance in a starring role. She's done her CV a great favour here.Directed by ""Troll Hunter"" director André Øvredal, I really enjoyed this one. I'm not a massive fan of 'slasher' style horror films. I have no burning desire to be constantly reminded of what the inside of my body looks like. So this turned out to be much-more to my liking than the normal horror flick. It had enough spookiness to make me turn on the lights when I got back home, but not enough to pervade my dreams.The young cast perform well. They are given enough back-story and personality by the script to make you care about their fate.So overall, this one comes with a ""Recommended for wimps"" (like me)!(For the full graphical review, please check out One Mann's Movies on t'interweb or Facebook.

They prank older boy and bully Tommy (Austin Abrams) who chases them into a drive-in movie theatre (showing George A. Romero's NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD) and hide out in lone teenager Ramon's (Michael Garza) car. Tommy catches up with them before they run into the old dark and creepy abandoned house that once belonged to the Bellows family. Wandering around the house (with Tommy in pursuit) they experience a couple of creepy incidents when one of the teens, Stella (Zoe Colletti) takes an old note book that once belonged to Sarah Bellows, a young girl who had apparently committed suicide. The handwritten book tells a number of horrific tales and when they discover the next day that Tommy has disappeared with a scarecrow wearing Tommy's clothes it seems to connect with a story in the book. Stella and Ramon start to realise that the book is writing itself with horrific tales based off each of the teenager's deepest neuroses and fears and starts to get rid of them one by one.Based off a series of short horror stories by Alvin Schwartz aimed at younger readers, Norwegian director André Øvredal continues on his path as a horror director having started with such critical successes as TROLL HUNTER (2010) and THE AUTOPOSY OF JANE DOE (2016) with a more 'Goosebumps' type story, but here works with another master of the fantasy picture, Guillermo Del Toro who was the originally intended director. Del Toro had worked on the script and was a co-producer, but his style is certainly felt in this film. The script does not go for the easy option of presenting the stories as an anthology, but instead works them seamlessly into the plot.

90,msbreviews,Rating: B-,6,19 August 2019,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)This might be the very first film of 2019, which I knew absolutely nothing about going into the theater. Usually, I avoid trailers for most movies, but it's almost impossible to not catch an image or a clip here and there. However, for Scary Stories, since it wasn't heavily marketed in my country (at least), the only things I knew was that Guillermo del Toro was involved and that it was a horror flick. Knowing del Toro, I also remembered myself that this wouldn't just be a straightforward horror story, filled with predictable jump scares, and a bland narrative. That's my first advice to my fellow readers: if you expect a film similar to those of The Conjuring Universe, then you'll be disappointed.It's also not the other extreme. It doesn't follow the ambiguity and weirdness of Jordan Peele's installments, so if you're one of those people that don't appreciate that type of horror, you're safe as well. Having in mind the latest movies released from the genre, it's hard to find one that balances these two separate takes instead of choosing one of them. Scary Stories spends its first half slow-building their characters, but mainly its story. There's a massive build-up to something that's pretty much the premise of the film, so it struggles to reach the actual ""action"" without it becoming a tad boring or too long. It's a ""breath of fresh air"" (in the genre, I mean) to have a good set up, with decent character development, and an exponential interest in the main story, instead of jumping into silly horror sequences fifteen minutes after it started.André Øvredal does an excellent job in directing. He really knows how to generate suspense and create a genuinely creepy build-up. There's tremendous camera work involved in some fantastic sequences that don't rely on jump scares to provide the ""fear"" factor. It's the never-ending suspense, that feeling of claustrophobia even if the character isn't in a confined space. Except for one scene, we can always see what's happening. The ""monsters"" don't appear out of nowhere, they don't screech at you precisely at the third time a character looks another way, and the actual jump scares are rather efficient. However, they're not scary, as well as the movie itself...It's not simply a scary film. It doesn't have that heavy and dark tone that we feel in other horror movies. At first, I thought it might be a bad thing, but Scary Stories establishes this distinct tone from the very beginning. Even without knowing a single thing about the film, I understood from the first few minutes that it was going to be ""different"". I would advise caution to not judge this movie by its trailers if they indicate that this is one of those films to make you scream every five minutes. There's definitely a message to be transmitted, and I think it was well-delivered in the ending. It might be too cheesy for some or lack impact for a movie that asks the audience for a bit of patience, but for me, it worked well enough.The acting is mostly good. Zoe Colletti (Stella) and Michael Garza (Ramon) are undoubtedly the standouts, and they do a good job of carrying the narrative forward. They both have compelling backstories, but for the time that the film spends developing its characters, I wish they went more in-depth with Stella. She has a particularly intriguing past, and I don't think we get enough out of it. Gabriel Rush (Auggie) and Austin Zajur (Chuck) have great chemistry, but their comic-relief roles are a disservice to an otherwise pretty solid movie.Technically, there are some beautiful shots from the DP, Roman Osin. Usually, sequences at night in low-budget films suffer a lot with lack of clear visibility, but Osin does a remarkable job, playing with lighting in a truly unique way. I'm curious to know what audiences will think of this movie. If I had to bet, I think people will leave disappointed due to the lack of more generic jump scares, and a straightforward narrative. Truth be told, the slow pacing doesn't help, especially when the character development only works for two. Finally, the ""scary stories"" that Sarah tells are entertaining and imaginative, and the whole concept of this film is incredibly captivating.All in all, Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark is a distinct horror flick, with well-developed leads, and a creative approach to an unique premise. It doesn't follow the rules of generic horror, by not relying itself too much on jump scares, and making the actual story and characters the main interest. Beautifully-produced by Guillermo del Toro and co. as well as brilliantly directed by André Øvredal. The ""scary stories"" are indeed dark and creepy, providing a whole second-half of excellent horror scenes.However, the first-half takes its time to set everything up, and the lack of more ""action"" might leave some viewers disappointed. Only two characters are genuinely engaging, which proves that the slow build-up didn't entirely pay off as it should have. It's meant to be a divisive movie, but I definitely recommend seeing it!",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark

101,FrenchEddieFelson,An efficient scary movie populated by chimerical creatures,6,30 August 2019,"Film directed by André Øvredal and co-written with Guillermo del Toro, Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark (2019) benefits from an efficient Halloween atmosphere, an excellent photography, the nostalgic 60's dress code, impressive old cars and rather talented young actors. On certain aspects, in particular the ineluctably-fatalistic side, the film makes me think of A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) directed by Wes Craven in which a psychopath sadistically haunts teens during their sleep.After the showing of a cult film (Night of the Living Dead (1968)) in a drive-in theater, a group of teens arrives, we do not really know how, in a time-worn mansion on the edge of town, abandoned for ages after an unexplained murder. By chance, they find a book. A cursed book! The small town will then suffer a wave of atrocious deaths. Stella and Ramón will have to face their own worst demons in order to stop the carnage and save the inhabitants.As a synthesis: an efficient teen movie for getting started with cinematographic thrills. 6/7 of 10",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark
102,Draysan-Jennings,Good but got a little boring,6,25 October 2019,I wanted to give this movie a 7 but it was just missing something. Found myself distracted a lot during this film. Didn't really keep my attention. I will say it was filmed very well though. I wouldn't watch it again but I don't fell like I wasted my time sitting through it.,Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark
103,sweidman-28016,Good Teen Horror for Starters,6,16 August 2019,"Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark Review:Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark is a new horror movie based on the books by Alvin Schwartz with the terrifying illistrations by Stephen Gammell. The movie takes place in l968 in the small town of Mill Valley where for generations, the shadow of the Bellows family has loomed large. It is in their mansion on the edge of town that Sarah, a young girl with horrible secrets, turned her tortured life into a series of scary stories, written in a book that has transcended time--stories that have a way of becoming all too real for a group of teenagers who discover Sarah's terrifying tome. This looked a lot like the plot of the Goosebumps movie. I will admit that I never watched that movie but I know the plot. I also didn't really read these books much as a kid. I do remember reading one and being creeped out by a few stories. The illistrations creeped my out even more. The trailer didn't look too bad and I watch basically all new releases so I saw it last week. It's taken me a while to write this review because I wasn't exactly sure on my definite thoughts for the movie. I've read and watched different reviews to find the different pros and cons for the various aspects throughout. Many people have been coming out of it having positive things to say. Personally I thought it was just alright. The plot isn't that bad. It's the different parts of the plot that I didn't like. To start out with the positives, I really liked the Scary Stories part of it. We have the different stories like Harold the Scarecrow, The Dream, The Big Red Spot, and a couple more (I don't know if those were the exact titles but I think it's something similar to that). I had a fun time watching those and it put a smile on my face. The creatures looked absolutely amazing with great practical effects paying omage to the Stephen Gammell illistrations. My favorite two creatures were The Pale Lady from The Dream and the corpse from The Toes story (if that's what it's called). The body actors were very good. Nobody really acknowledges those people behind the monsters and creatures and we should. Javier Botet's work was very good and I also liked Troy James as he contortioned his body. The scary stories had a great sense for suspense. We know what's going to happen but it was much more suspenseful than I thought it would be. THey had the problem of adding more jump scares than there needed to be. Some I thought were necessary but after about four I'm done with them because we typically laugh them off. I usually mention that in my other reviews so I won't go further in depth with that. It was also violent at parts. Another problem that I had was with those violent parts it was usually some CGI thing that was obvious, kind of like in IT. I really enjoyed IT but they over CGId at parts. Overall I really liked the Scary Stories parts. It's just a shame that they aren't in there as much as I hoped. Instead we mostly follow the group of teenagers being scared and messing around. They make dumb decisions. They do typical horror don'ts. I wouldn't say it was horrible to watch their whole plot, just entertaining. I could've cared less about the characters. They tried to add some background to some characters. Good for them for trying but some scenes for that could've been cut out. The two actors I liked were Zoe Margaret Colletti as Stella and Michael Garza as Ramon. They're the two main characters and they were the closest to emotion attachment to any characters we had. The Sarah Bellow's story kind of bothered me and I really didn't want a character like her in there. It was at the end and we got a cool way to see the back story which I liked. I think that helped but I really just wanted to see the Scary Story stuff. It's hard for me to write reviews like this. Movies the I love I can just write about quickly and cover basically everything. Movies I don't like are easy to write since there's not a whole lot to cover, yet they're not enjoyable to write on. Every director has a vision but sometimes it's just not executed in a good way which sucks for them. Now movies that are fine or just ok are harder because it either sounds like I'm trying to bash it or finding all the positives. I think this is a good movie to start someone out who wants to dive deeper into horror. A couple years ago I probably would've liked this a lot more because it's a good scary movie for teens. I'm sure those who are big fans of the books will like this movie. I thought it was just ok. I don't see myself watching it again soon. Maybe around Halloween for the fun, entertaining horror scenes.My Grade: C+",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark

Well, actually I do know - Nixon by a long shot!This movie is pretty good, though it does lag at parts. Hey, any scary movie that begins with Donovan's ""Season of the Witch"" is on the right track! Actually, the music is good throughout, with the effective use of ""The Hearse Song"" throughout, and the cool cover by Lana Del Rey over the end credits!As for the movie itself, I was definitely spooked at parts! It all revolves around a book of horror stories written by Sarah Bellows, who was locked away in her family's home, in the basement. And the book is still writing! ""You don't read the book. It reads you."" The stories are good, especially ""Harold"" which was very freaky for me!

I'm surprised how accurate thesemonsters look to the drawings in the book. This film was one of the worst attempts at a horror I've seen. And the fact it has a 6.5 on IMDB at time of writing shocks me. this standards should have been a lot lower like 0.1 story plot doesn't make any sense very Lame main antagonist, some chick gotabused and killed by her family so she kills anyone who touches some book and writes how they would die that's what it is. characters were lame they were not a single scene makes you care about any of the characters. No horror,suspense or thriller-esque qualities. this director sucks being horror director. people DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME with this film it will leave you in dark with nothing and stories to tell is nothing. stories suck it will leave you dark with a empty handed i rather take a dump at toilets room in dark that would have been a better stories to tell in dark. people this film will leave you in dark with nothing in your hands just put your money in pocket and leave.",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark

107,TwistedContent,Solid PG-13 Horror Entertainment,7,12 August 2019,"Guillermo Del Toro & Andre Ovredal, a director with quite a promising career, has, I'd say, successfully brought to screen stories, characters and vibes that I was terrified of being a kid. In fact, I'm gonna take up the book for nostalgia purposes, because the movie managed to hit that note at least a bit.Honestly, I was expecting an itsy bitsy cheesy bloodless horror fun with a good amount of comic relief things, but I'm happy to say that it's not much of a cheese and has very little comical elements. Nevertheless, the story is familiar & pretty straight forward, with characters that you've kinda seen before, but they're painted well enough to not be flat. There's a good amount of very well done visuals, a lot of practical fx & also some cgi which doesn't jump out as bad or even noticeable. The kills are fun, unexpectedly gruesome in a goreless, bloodless way, the build-ups and atmosphere also pleasantly surprised, boredom was not among the emotions the movie raised in me. My only bigger complaint is the ending - it was a bit anti-climatic, yet the last three or so minutes made me feel warm & ready for the sequel, which, looking at the box office, will come. Other than that, a few short sequences might've dragged a bit, but it didn't really bother me. Oh, and one really cool thing about this movie is the time setting - the year of 1968. Dug that.To sum it up, it's neither a masterpiece or 2019's best horror movie, but it's a creepy load of fun to be had on the big-screen with the whole family. Or alone.

I am however slightly familiar with the director: André Øvredal! As he is norwegian, like me! Also I enjoyed Trollhunters and Autopsy of Jane Doe.So. This is a horror movie, not quite meant for children, but not quite for grown-ups either. Scarier than Goosebumps, less scary than Hereditary. It's almost like a mix between a regular movie, and an anthology. With shorter stories blending with the main story.I'll admit I didn't find it scary, but I still really liked it. The ""monsters/creatures"" designs are very good (or horrible, depends how you look at it). They don't look like every other monster we have ever seen, and that's cool.The sound is extremely crisp and very loud. Two different times I got kinda scared because of the loud volume. Had I been at home, I would have reached for that volume rocker!The story is, as expected perhaps, pretty decent, and I liked all the stories within the story. The visuals (as mentioned) and just how it's done. Øvredal definitely has a knack for directing. (Which is pretty useful for a director, lol)
I do think we get to see the creatures a little too much, which is what makes it less scary, but cool since they look and act great.The acting was alright, I liked the kids and their chemistry. This is just a perfect slumberparty-movie. Wish I was young again!Entertaining, more cool than scary, awesome visuals, will watch again.",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark

Based on Alvin Schwartz's series of young adult novels, this collaboration between Troll Hunter director Andre Øvredal and producer / co-writer Guillermo del Toro is like Goosebumps only scarier. The central story is a touch flimsy, but the movie does at least deliver the goods when it comes to the set pieces. A scarecrow comes alive and kills a teenage bully in a cornfield. Spiders explode out of a zit on a girls face. A severed big toe ends up simmering in a bowl of stew. Frequent del Toro collaborator Mike Elizalde of Spectral Motion (known for Hellboy, X-Men and Stranger Things) was responsible for the special make up effects. He pulled out all the stops to bring the Jingly Man to life, a scary creation that has the unnerving ability to re-assemble his dismembered limbs at will. The soundtrack features Donovan performing Season of the Witch, and the film is generally good fun for young and old movie watchers alike.

The problem? It's not scary in the slightest.Sure, some of the creatures that clearly came from the mind of del Toro are interesting, but even some of the most intentionally scary parts are unintentionally laughable. Perhaps it's a case of this movie being intended for a younger demographic. Either way, 'Scary Stories' is not unique enough to stand apart from many other middling genre entries, notwithstanding the theme of the Vietnam war as a backdrop.This is one story that's better off not being read...or watched, in this case.",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark

Sarah Bellows, The young girl of the family, used to write short horror stories that reflected her own grief-stricken life. The characters in those stories came to life for her then and now they transcend the page in the lives of the teenagers who discover her book and plan to be the end of them. I hadn't heard of the book series before the release of this film and I think any fans off the series will get a real kick out of the way the monsters have been realised on screen. The practical effects melded with cgi is really great! I would like to go back and read the books as I have heard comparison to R.L. Stine's Goosebumps which I was a massive fan of as a kid. The illustrations by Stephen Gammell for the Scary Stories books are truly a thing of nightmarish beauty that I haven't stopped searching since watching this one. Sadly, I felt a bit unengaged throughout the film version. I appreciate it's an interesting spook fest for anyone dipping their toes into the horror genre and believe it will be a good one to watch with your kids once they reach a certain age. Unfortunately, in terms of story and characters, it does all fall a bit flat and ends up feeling like a rip off of 'IT'. However, if it's Halloween and you're settling down for the night with a few beers, it's fine late night entertainment and does host two really cool creations in Harold the Scarecrow and the Pale Lady who provide the two most impressive set pieces",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark

""Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark"" is an attempt to create a film for teenagers, so do not expect a lot of gore. However considering his PG-13 classification, is very graphic sometimes. It could have been darker, but it fails to deliver, and it wants to play safe. Honestly, from the same guy that produced ""The Pan's Labyrinth"" and the show ""The Strain"" I was expecting something more. Monsters are very creative especially the Gangling Man, is particularly scary, as well as some killings. Acting feel... cheap. They could've hired better actors, their performances are completely unremarkable, especially the one of Zoe Colletti, the main character.As an horror movie fan I was waiting for this piece for a long time. In a moment where most of horror films are cheap, made by incompetent people on the subject, this one stand out a little bit more, but unfortunately it uses jumpscares, a technique that in the last decade (at least) is widely used. I was quite disappointed by this. The final verdict? Do not expect too much.

Little do they know when curiosity get the better of them the book starts writing there own stories with dramatic consequences. Wow this was a pleasant surprise to me. I really really enjoyed this film and its creativity and uniqueness lets talk about why this is.Lets start of with the films nice 60,s aesthetics and its stunning visuals. I really loved that the whole film felt like it was actually from the time period it was supposed to be. With it was the set pieces or its costume designs even the outdoor cinema. I really liked and appreciated the effort they went into with making it look as close to the time period as possible. I also liked the creative colour palette of the film. Whether it was reds which represent danger. Or blues and purples the film really just felt different to any other horror film i have seen.Next the film was actually pretty funny in places as well. I thought all the lead cast and main group of friends actually had pretty good comedic chemistry. The whole group just had very funny and entertaining banter between each other. And the best part despite being set in the 60,s the humour still resignated with todays audience making the characters likeable and easy to connect with.Next the film was pretty scary had excellent jumpscares and a well executed tense tone. Wow this film had me on the edge of my seat. It executed the jumpscares really well. Whether it was silence or a delayed jumpscare it really made you tense whilst watching a lot of scenes. And they actually had some out of the blue scares as well that made the film less predictable.The reason why the film was so scary was due to its excellent physical performances and character designs of the monsters. Wow i have to credit Troy James for his physical performance of the jangly man. They way his body twisted and contorted really made the character more scary and disturbing to watch. I hope he gets more work like this as he was excellent in one of the only few good things in hellboy Baba yaga. Next the creature designs were incredibly creative and disturbing. Whether it was a scarecrow,a dead corpse with a missing two or a creepy absorbing monster the film was very creative and something different compared to other horrors. and the fact that all of the creatures were prosthetics made me even more in love with the film.Next i thought that the film had excellent acting. All the kids did a great job with the making the audience understand and see there pain and sadness. They went all out in the scary scenes which made you connect to the characters more as thats what you would be doing in there situations. Also all the characters just had so many likeable qualities to them that you did not want to see them die so therefore unlike other horror films there deaths actually meant something. Two key acting standouts for me however would be Zoe Colleti and Natalie ganzhorn .And the film actually had a lot of good character development for the main villain. They went so deep into her backstory and the pain and suffering she went through you sort of understood why she was so angry and taking being locked up for so long out on the main characters. I loved when stella actually went back in time and was the little girl. It just made you understand the pain she went through which i just found really great. However i would of liked there to have been more character development and a arc with Stella. Her family dynamic with her mum was mentioned but i felt they did not dive deep enough into why her mum left her family. I think maybe flashbacks or explaining from the dad would of helped.And just ending on one more slight nitpick. I found the school bullies generic and they had no personality to them. I just wish films with a high school concept would have more reasoning into why the school bullies to what they do.Overall despite only a couple of things they could of improved on scary stories to tell in the dark really surprised me at how good it was. It was my favourite horror film i have seen and this should be what other horror films strive to be like.",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark

121,movieman6-413-929510,Scary Stories is more exciting than really scary.,6,11 August 2019,"Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark is a new horror film directed by André Øvredal, the director of Trollhunter and The Autopsy of Jane Doe. The film is based on the eponymous book series by writer Alvin Schwartz.The film is set in 1968 in the small town of Mill Valley. During Halloween, a group of friendly teenagers decide to go to the abandoned mansion of the Bellows family. Legend has it that the youngest daughter Sarah Bellows (Kathleen Pollard) has been abused by her family here, so she started telling scary stories to visitors to scare them off.
When Stella (Zoe Margaret Colletti) finds Sarah her book and takes it with her, she learns that the stories from the book are coming to life. Stella learns about the curse of the book and that the evil spirit of Sarah Bellows is now starting to write stories to put Stella and her friends at risk for their lives. Stella and her friends now have to find a way to break the curse, before they become victims of the monsters of Sarah Bellow's stories.With the help of Guillermo del Toro as co-writer and producer, André Øvredal has been able to give this film a well-fitting atmosphere and mood. The scary stories of Sarah Bellows are presented in an exciting and interesting way in the film. This way, after Stella has read the stories, you will see the events in the following scenes. In this way, as a viewer you get the chance to fantasize about the coming events and what they will look like. Then you get to see the events of the stories in the film.
The story of this film has some well-known events that have been used in other horror films before. If you are familiar with horror films, the story of this film can come across as familiar and you can predict a bit about what is going to happen.In the film they also used good effects to portray the stories and the monsters from the stories. Most of the monsters were placed in the film with dolls, costumes and makeup. This is how this monster comes across in a very realistic way. A few monsters have been placed in the film with CGI, but despite the lesser exposure in the scenes with the CGI monsters, they seem a bit less realistic in the film.The cast of the film consists of more unknown actors, who have played more small roles in another film. Despite the unfamiliarity of the cast, they still provide good and appropriate acting. The actors who play the group of friends come across as friends who really care about each other and try to save each other from the stories from Sarah Bellows' book.",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark

131,anthonyjlangford,Old fashioned story telling fun,8,28 October 2019,"'Stories' reminded me of films of the 80's, even though it's set in the 60's. It's what a horror film should be. It doesn't take itself too seriously, not initially at least. It involves a group of outcast teenagers, your archetypal set-up but as it progresses it branches out into fresh territory.It eventually develops into something darker and becomes more inventive in the process. Throughout Zoe Margaret Colletti gives a terrific performance. She's the glue that holds it together and gives it its emotional center. She's great.With so many average horror films out there (including the hugely budgeted overcooked It II), 'Scary Stories' is both old fashioned and fresh. I didn't find it particularly scary (unlike The Haunting of Hill House), but it's creepy and authentic and very enjoyable as a piece of entertainment.

141,RhapsodyReviews,So Entertaining and Scary.,8,17 October 2019,"Review:
'Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark' is an American horror film directed by André Øvredal. It is based on the children's book series of the same name by Alvin Schwartz. This is one of those movies that shouldn't work and probably wouldn't have worked if it weren't for the people behind the scenes.
Three friends, Stella (Zoe Margaret Colletti), Auggie (Gabriel Rush) and Chuck (Austin Zajur) meet a new guy in town named Ramon (Michael Garza) on Halloween night and decide to go to the known to be haunted house of The Bellows family. Upon entering Ramon and Stella come upon a hidden doorway, which they believe to be the room where the family hid their deformed daughter Sara Bellows. They find a book filled with scary stories that Sara wrote and read for kids, who than later disappeared. Now, having read from the book Stella and her friends find out that stories are being written about them and try and stop Sara before their story is told.
The acting in a movie is very important to me, and if a movie has bad acting, I get taken out of the story that is trying to be told. I can say with the upmost confidence, everybody will enjoy the acting in this movie. You can tell all the actors cared about the material that they were bringing to the screen. If I had to pick a standout, I would have to say Austin Zajur who plays Chuck in the movie. He is the character that provides the comic relief in this movie and he does to so well, with the quick witty humor. When the time comes for him to show his dramatic side, it is like a switch goes off and he brings it there too. I was amazed by his capabilities.
I will say that the beginning of the movie is lacking in introduction of characters, but when they find the book and the first story is being told, the movie takes off! Every story that is being told does a good job now being repetitive and feel like your watching an anthology series that have a big connection. Without giving anything away, the way it ended was in a way where they could make a second one. I would be conflicted with that because this is so good as a stand-alone movie, I wouldn't want it to become a franchise even though there are plenty more stories to tell.
Overall, this will be a movie I will watch multiple times and still have a smile on my face. It's not a flawless film, and there are scarier horror films out there for sure. There is something about this movie that's original and you can have fun with.

146,carologletree,A Solid Summer Blockbuster with some Legitimately Terrifying Moments,8,20 August 2019,"I saw this movie in theaters the other day, and I thought it was pretty darn good. Concept-wise, this movie feels rather similar to the Jack Black ""Goosebumps"" movies, given that it is about a group of kids finding a collection of scary stories and making the monsters from those stories come to life by opening the books. However, I thought that this movie was a little bit better than those films, because in addition to being fairly well-written, it can be genuinely scary sometimes.The atmosphere in this film is great. It has a nice eeriness to it, and you can feel the gradual increase in tension and dread as more and more of the monsters come to life. In addition, the backstory behind the stories that these monsters are from, which involves the writer having been turned into a rage-filled monster from being abused and victimized by her family, was appropriately disturbing.As for the monsters themselves, they are really well-done. In terms of design, they are recreated from the artwork of the books surprisingly well, and some of the scenes they are in have some grotesque imagery. The scarecrow Harold and The Jangly Man stood out, but the most terrifying scenes for me were the scene with The Pale Lady at the halls of the hospital and the scene where hundreds of spiders came out of Ruth's spider bite.The performances from the cast are pretty solid for the most part, especially Zoe Colletti as Stella. There are some scenes that feel rather like padding, but other than that, the pacing for this film was pretty good, especially in the later half.I was entertained and even sometimes frightened by this film. I recommend this to fans of the books and just anyone who loves a good scare.RATING: B+",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark

149,lucasnochez,Film Review: Scary Stories To Tell In The Dark/www.nightfilmreviews.com,6,27 February 2020,"Scary Stories To Tell In The Dark is a revisionist tale of all of your favourite horror movies from the 1970s to our present time, amalgamated into one very solid and well done horror film. Directed by André Øvredal and heavily influenced and produced by Guillermo Del Toro, Scary Stories is a fresh yet cozily familiar peak into a growing genre of cinema that is not only its due diligence, but gaining exponential notoriety in the film industry. The film manages to be youthful but not irritating and scary but not grotesque, blending clichés and devices together and delivering them with class and effortlessness.The story kicks off on Halloween; no punches are pulled when it comes to nostalgia considering the film is based in the 60's. Heavy nods to films like 1987's Adventures in Babysitting are made, giving light to a very breezy yet heartwarming entrance to the characters. Our main protagonists Stella Nichols (Zoe Margaret Colletti) is a young aspiring horror fiction writer who has, as expected, a geeky group of friends. Auggie played by Gabriel Rush, the kindhearted rational player in this game and his best buddy Chuck played by Austin Zajur, are just a bunch of nerds trying to get back at the resident jock Tommy (Austin Abrams) who so happens also is dating Chuck's sister Ruthie (Natalie Ganzhorn).While the characters are somewhat cliches embryos, each character serves its purpose with glee; Chuck provides the main comedic relief in the film, Stella is the bookworm, Auggie is the realist and newly formed friend Ramon Morales (Michael Garza) is the newbie who they tumble upon and find shelter after chucking faces in Tommy's car, stumbling upon Ramon at a local drive in. What's interesting yet weirdly satisfying about the film is how Del Toro, who had a heavy influence in the creation of the film being the film's main producer, incorporates some social consciousness and real-world dilemmas into the film with minority based subtexts and racist undertones, giving the film a familiar yet authentic feel.So after thwarting off Tommy and his band of Outsiders inspired jocks, it being Halloween and all, it only seemed fitting that Ramon and the trio of main characters visit an old, resident haunted house owned by the small town's primary original family. While some jokes and pranks are delivered throughout the house, Chuck comes across an unsettling encounter with an unnamed figure, and Stella, being the horror fanatic that she is, ends up stealing on the supposedly haunted Sarah Bellows' books. What she doesn't know is, the book starts to live out the deepest and darkest fears of our protagonists as well as antagonists, in horror delight fashion. Each story of our characters are done in a very interesting and ingenious vignette style with each spooky story in my opinion getting scarier and scarier, or in cinematic terms, more Del Toro.Del Toro's contributions to the film are quite obvious; his signature coloring of scenes is prevalent and absolutely adds to the eeriness of Scary Stories. Heavy rich reds used effectively to show either impending horror or in one case thrusting us right into it, the grayish blues that I feel are Del Toro's go to for atmosphere are breathtaking. My first exposure to Del Toro's color palette was when I watched Pan's Labyrinth back in 2006; yet despite the film being less of a horror film, the eerie atmosphere and tone of the film was spine-tingling, to say the least.Scary Stories plays close to Labyrinth's stylistically and I couldn't have been more visually satisfied especially considering that palette paired with 60's nostalgia which, I adore. The monsters are all truly terrifying in their own way and possess an unsettling realness to them; no creature or ghoul feels too outlandish, or too far from our own reality. For the first time in a long time, the monsters actually feel like they were plucked from our own consciousness; our deepest fears and demons. That's what Scary Stories so good is how the film and narrative revitalizes horror and the genre as a while, but allow it's characters and spooky set-pieces to stand alone and create a world that is familiar, yet new. It makes you as the viewer feel young again, touching that place deep down that I don't think horror has touched in a long time, a aura of retrospective and nostalgia.Scary Stories does everything a horror film should do and more. Yes it scares, induces jumps, scream and terrors but like so many horror films of the 1980s, its also a good time at the cineplexes. Much like the Nightmare on Elm Street, Friday the 13th and Child's Play were a riotous time at the cinema back then, those films didn't take themselves too seriously yet were still as spooky, fun and entertaining. More than anything, Scary Stories had me entertained, from beginning to end.I'm sure we all remembered those insanely vivid and outrageously scary covers of the original Scary Stories To Tell In The Dark books, with the creepy black and white covers and hint of red and blue, terrorizing our eyes and awaiting our eyes to close to flood our dreams. The stories in those books traumatized me as a child and always had me gripping my pillow and sheets tight. The cinematic version of the film might not do that, but, Scary Stories To Tell In The Dark absolutely puts the fun back in horror and the scary back in story; taking us back to our younger more impressionable years of childhood, adolescence and innocence.",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark

152,bastille-852-731547,Very Weak Horror Film for Younger Audiences,4,9 August 2019,"I was a bit skeptical about how the trailers for this looked, but I decided to see it anyway because Guillermo del Toro was producing (who I love.) I have not read the book on which it is based. Unfortunately, the film was a mess, and I'm honestly pretty surprised that Del Toro attached his name to this, even though he's not directing this time.The film tells the story of a group of teenagers who enter a haunted house on Halloween, and end up reading a book of scary stories that comes to life. Unfortunately, far too much of virtually all of the stories are revealed in the film's trailers, which reduces the impact of them on the viewer. Additionally, most of them except the ""Jangly Man"" story at the end are too short to really have a real impact on the viewer. Unlike other Del Toro-credited efforts in the horror genre, like the Gothic horror film ""Crimson Peak,"" this movie overloads itself with loud and obnoxious jump-scares, which is one of the laziest tropes in modern horror movies. There's no genuine suspense or dread building. The script is generally rather weak, and the characters are underdeveloped. The writers try some attempt at social commentary by making some parallels to some of Richard Nixon's worst instincts (the story is set in 1968) to try to highlight similarities between Nixon and Trump. Unfortunately, however, this attempt at social commentary feels too forced, unlike in (for example) Jordan Peele's films where the social commentary is both subtle-at-times yet strikingly genuine. I will give Del Toro credit for making visually interesting creatures/monsters in the stories, as we can always expect from him. But otherwise, this film ends up being a misfire. It's also not clear who its target audience is, as it's too scary for children but too childish for most teen and adult viewers. Not recommended. 4/10",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark

155,eelen-seth,Definitely made to attract a wider audience than your usual PG-13 horror.,6,27 September 2019,"Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark is based on the children's book series of the same name by Alvin Schwartz. I never grew up reading these books, or even had I heard of them, until I got notified of Guillermo del Toro writing the screenplay for this adaptation. Purely based on the trailer and its premise, I was expecting something eery, with a Goosebumps-feel to it.The story is set in 1968. It's Halloween and a trio of high school teenagers decide to go trick-or-treating for the very last time, before they head to college. After ""egg-ing"" the high school bully's car, our group of friends has to run for their lives, when being chased through the woods. Here they bump into the abandoned Bellows manor, which everyone assumes is haunted by Sarah Bellows, the daughter of the wealthy Mr. Bellows. In the dark manor, they find a book with scary stories, that belonged to Sarah. Stella (Zoe Margaret Colletti) decides to take the book with her, unknowingly unleashing an evil force that will haunt her and her friends.André Øvredal's film is definitely made to appeal to a younger audience that likes jump scares. I'm not a big fan of those, since I feel like it cheapens the atmosphere that a film's setting is trying to establish. There's a lot of jump scares, and they're not even that good. The stories that come to life in the film are genuinely scary, although on the short side. Being that the film runs for a 108 minutes, I felt like the screenplay really took its time to pull me in. For some viewers, this might take too long and find it boring by the time the first creature brutally pops onto the screen.The visual and practical effects are terrifying. The ""Pale Lady"" is something that could haunt your dreams for life - not overly gross or disgusting, but just creepy and disturbing. The production design gives you that late '60s feel without ever coming across overproduced. Marco Beltrami and Anna Drubich's score feels a little bit generic, and could've easily been the score for the new Goosebumps film. Myself being a big fan of Beltrami's work, this was a bit of a disappointment.The young cast was simply terrific. Leading the pack is Zoe Margaret Colletti (Wildlife) who could easily become the next Emma Stone. Her emotional range is spectacular and this performance should definitely get her some exciting new opportunities. The other supporting members of the main group are the charming Michael Garza (Wayward Pines), a short but impressive performance by Gabriel Rush (The Grand Budapest Hotel) and Austin Zajur (Fist Fight).When Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark finally decides to drive up the intensity, it mostly makes you look forward to the next story to unfold right before your eyes. The film has some pacing issues and that could let a lot of horror fans down, but the atmosphere overall makes up for that. The story sets up a sequel, which if this first instalment does well, will definitely get made in the next couple of years. Must be the season of the witch.",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark

161,theredsky,Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark Review,6,14 August 2019,"This is a decent movie. It's not great but it definitely has its moments. Here are the negatives. The script for the film for the most part sucks. The dialogue feels incredibly weird and forced that it feels awkward. Another issue is that half of the characters in this film have little to no development. The two leads have backstories that are interesting while the other two, Chuck and Auggie, just don't have any stories behind them. All we know is that they are friends with the lead character. I read some of the short stories before seeing the actual film and the film is just not as terrifying as the novel. The film is definitely creepy and somewhat scary but it isn't as scary as the novel it is based on. Here are the positives. I think the acting is great from everyone. Most of the cast consists of teen actors and I think they all do a great job. The film knows how to build tension really well. The corn field scene is a perfect example. There is always a sense of dread looming over the sequence until the scarecrow finally appears. The creature designs are really cool and creepy. The Pale Lady and Harold are really cool looking and creepy to look at. Some of the scenarios that happen in the movie make your skin crawl. Most of those scenes are genuinely creepy and make you wonder why this film isn't rated R. The production design for this movie is pretty good. I enjoy each set piece and they all felt real. The editing is pretty good for the most part and the cinematography is decent. There are some really cool shots though many of which revolve around The Pale Lady and the Jangly Man. The pacing and tone both remain consistent. Overall, Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark is a decent horror film which great acting and really good monster design but lacks a good script and isn't as terrifying as the original novel. I give Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark a 6/10.",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark
162,el7,Great Halloween fare,8,3 June 2020,"Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark is based on a popular kids' anthology, and it ties the anthology together with a backstory that is frightening in its own right. The movie starts with some teens in a small Midwestern town on Halloween night in 1968. As kids did in small towns before there was the internet, they had a night of pranks and trespassing planned. They wind up at the town's haunted mansion, where they find an old book, and gradually realize that there is something very wrong with that book. The special effects and cinematography are exceptional, as you'd expect from the team that worked on this movie. Some of the cheese being served here is Velveeta, but overall it's a great flick to have in your lineup for an annual viewing during the spooky season.",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark
163,ben-mckimm,Misleading,4,14 May 2021,The promotional material for this film were really misleading. It feels like it's made for kids but it's dressed up like it's made for adults. I'm definitely too old for this. Feels like it was made for Nickelodeon.,Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark
164,jacksisjax,Why Did This Take Place In 1968?,6,19 October 2020,"Did I like this movie?
I do not like scary movies.
They make me feel icky.
I spent a whole summer watching like every single scary movie every night and it was an icky time.
But I had a good thyme watching this.
I think in general scary movies are NOT good. Most scary movies have poor actors, low budgets, crap direction and just poor overall production value. There are exceptions to the rule obviously.
This is KIND of one of them.
Mind you. It's still kinda dumb. But I actually think this movie is beautifully shot, the direction isn't horrible and it seems like they were dealing with a pretty big budget. The overall production was not bad at all.
But was it good? Nahhhh. It's not a good movie.
But was it a good SPOOKY movie? Yeah I would say it was...I definitely sound like an idiot.
Here's the deal- if I am going to watch a scary movie in my home, at Halloween time, this one ISNT a bad one to watch.",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark
165,cbnewham,Enjoyable enough,8,1 April 2021,"A reasonable storyline, good acting and good visual effects. All and all worth a watch. It's not particularly scary and some of it is predictable, but certainly better than a lot of recent attempts.A strong 8.",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark
166,FilmBuff0409,Disappointing,4,29 August 2019,"The best way to sum this movie up is by watching the trailer pretty much. It shows every single 'scary' scene in the movie so there's no way to be scared or guessing what might happen next. So that was a major let down.Next. I understand that this is targeted for a younger audience but this was over the top stupid and unbelievable. A few things that stand out in my memory now are;
When the cop is standing in front of the Jangling Man, he literally just stands there. This monster is coming towards him and he does not move a muscle. Not sure who would do that but okay.
When the cop says the 'red spot' girl is going to be in the loonie bin for the rest of her life. Based on what? She had a panic attack an hour ago, that's not a life sentence to an asylum.
When the guy goes to get that wax sound machine to listen to Sarah Bellows, he just walks right over to the cupboard and pulls this machine out like he knew exactly where it was.
When the hospital workers shut down the whole building with red lights flashing and alarms going off because they saw a kid run down a hallway.I could go on and on about how poor everything in this film was but I just don't care anymore. Being a HUGE fan of the book series I feel very let down by this movie. I suggest just watch the trailer, it shows every single scene one might want to watch in that movie.",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark
167,timeblank,Tell them the Truth,6,18 August 2019,Honestly it feels like a final destination film. But I am sort of confused as to who is the target audience. Some scenes were creepy and gross. However I do fine the teen cast kind of boring and lame. Like they were meant to have no charisma. The story involves a book and the Ghost of Sarah. Everyone fate gets written in the book. They race against time to find the truth behind Sarah. Would you believe that the truth will set them free? Interesting concept or Lame ass concept?,Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark

Great lighting, set design in horror scenes
Callbacks to the book
Creative monster design
Very solid build up for horror scenesCons:
No good performances from any actor
Terrible script
Every scene that isn't a horror scene is poorly executed

Bad CG effects on all but one monster
Many horror scenes end on a bad jumpscare, don't meet the expectations set by the buildup
Lazy effects on things that weren't monstersBest part: Harold's chases and Tommy's death scene
Worst part: that shot of the fat ghost where they show exactly what she looks like, kills any possible suspense there was in that scene for a poorly executed, orthodox horror movie moment",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark

172,cwade22,All the characters were ANNOYING!,5,8 September 2019,"This whole movie was bad! Had some potential, but even if I were a child, i wouldn't be that scared. AS an Adult, I wasn't scared. The whole time, I kept saying ""please kill him and kill her, too!"" Stella WAS ANNOYING! Her voice, her screams, her nerdiness. I wanted Her to die. But CHUCK WAS THE MOST ANNOYING! His attempts at comedy(the writer's attempts) were Weak, forced and predictable. His face was annoying! His cowardice was annoying! His voice was annoying! Glad he died, but took way too long. Who cast him?! He was born in mexico, but isn't even hispanic. Del toro seems to like casting hispanics in this, but that's not the issue. I'm half black and look Hispanic but I'm not. I'm just confused about why they cast that boy for that role? Never heard of him until this movie. The concept of this movie comes from the book, which I never read, not heard about. That doesn't matter. I can use common sense to understand what I watch.Jump Scares are DUMB AND USELESS! I'd rather watch this garbage movie on MUTE! Subtitles and mute! I envy the deaf people watching this movie! No joke! They don't have to hear all the annoying screaming and yelling and over exaggerated audio! Watching this at home, you would have to adjust the volume 200 times every few seconds because regular dialogue was low, but yelling and other noises very high! I HATE MOVIES LIKE THIS! Volume should be same level, or not too drastically different. Jump scares are never scary! This volume issue ruined the movie for me. And all the ANNOYING SCREAMING!The movie and book are great conceptually, but the way this movie was made, Not very good. Casting, whatever. Nothing is perfect, but sone of these people were just not watchable and my ears HURT! Stop screaming so much! Dang!The ending part made little sense. WHO WAS THE LITTLE BLACK GIRL?! Why was she in the white people house?! Did they adopt her? Was She runaway slave? Even though this takes place in pennsylvania, and that sarah girl was in early 20th century, i was still confused about the black girl. Was She related to the old blind black lady? Why do i need to ask these questions?! WHO WROTE THIS MOVIE?! Why didn't they answer these things? Show me something, explain it! Dont just show it. I initially was going to rate a 9, but then after the first 2 minutes, It all went downhill. 5, because it had potential and may have scared my 5 year old self. But older than 8 years old, this movie shouldn't scare you. Just a lot of cheap attempts at thrills.",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark
173,tresm87,"A well executed, slightly modified adaptation that brings the classic anthology books to life, and creates possibility of a new horror franchise.",8,16 August 2019,"While the film has a Pg-13 rating that left many wanting an R rating at first, i'd say it was rather fitting considering these books were aimed at older kids. Ovredal/Del Toro utilized enough creative and effective imagery/ tension to really give it the ominous tone it needed to properly portray these timeless stories that many of us grew up with. While they modify the overall story to fit these several stories more cohesively, the additions work well.The film sets up with fantastic detail from the start introducing us to the characters, the town, and time period perfectly. As things progress and we start getting into the heart of the overall story, the delivery of the 5 intertwined scary stories are woven precisely into the mix although each could've been expanded on a tad bit longer imo. The added dynamic for the overall story makes all of these individual stories all the more effective. As everything comes to a conclusion in an intense finale, we see a set up for a possibility of a future franchise which i would totally be on board with to see more of the classic stories come to life as well as new ones.I cannot say enough about the attention to detail in this film. The aesthetic and atmosphere of the 1968 timeframe was absolutely spot on visually and threw you right back to the time. I know a lot of films are going back in time of late but sometimes the visuals aren't spot on like this. The design for the creatures was phenomenal and insanely realistic even when cgi was added to certain aspects and scenes. It was clear to see Del Toro's influence in capturing the essence of these classic illustrations from the original books with these outstandingly accurate portrayals. The clever crisply shot cinematography of Andre Ovredal was vibrant and made each scene even more satisfying through a wide array of colors and angles utilized. The visuals were everything you'd want in a horror film.The characters were way more likable than I anticipated and gave a great deal of charm to everything which was refreshing instead of just dull walking cliche's like they could've been. There was also a nice touch of emotional depth for a couple scenes. My main nitpick is that the stories were not long enough in the film. I understand that they had 5 stories to pack in another subplot story, but for a couple we maybe saw 3 total min without much expansion. The balance has to be found a bit better if they do decide a sequel which i hope they do because this was a very fun film that delivered exactly what it set out to do and more.",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark
174,BeanieCore,"Decent, albeit disappointing.",6,9 September 2021,"As someone who, like many horror fanatics, grew up with the ""Scary Stories"" book franchise, I had high hopes for this film adaptation. The involvement of none other than Guillermo Del Toro, and the direction of the talented Andre Ovredal (Trollhunter, The Autopsy Of Jane Doe) only solidified my anticipation. And though ""Scary Stories To Tell In The Dark"" is not a bad film by any means, it's not anything close to what it could have, and should have been.I was a bit apprehensive upon hearing that the film would be told with a much more traditional, linear narrative, as opposed to a typical anthology film. But I've never been one of those sorts who refuses to accept any changes when translating the written word to the screen, so I held out, in hopes of a good story. Sadly, the narrative is the weakest part of the film. It feels like a blatant attempt to cash in on the current trend of pseudo-nostalgia, and it's tale of teenage outcasts battling supernatural forces in 1960's America is far too similar to the recent ""It"" remake. In fact, the narrative itself shamelessly treads much of the exact same ground, but without the writing and witty dialogue to back it up. The film simply doesn't seem as sincere in it's moral-grounding, and instead, far more neutered. And Alvin Schwartz's delightfully nightmarish stories end up taking a backdrop to the clichés, rather than the forefront, as they should be.Nonetheless, the visuals are fantastic, and the moments in which Schwartz and Gammell's well known monsters take the screen are effective and memorable. No one who has grown up with the books will be able to contain their giddiness at seeing these iconic nightmares finally take the screen by storm. And though the film is never gorey, it doesn't skimp on Gammell's ghoulish designs. Meanwhile, Ovredal's direction is tight and assured, with gorgeous cinematography and well sustained tension during the more horrific scenes. The cast is quite good as well, with a likeable group of misfits, and newcomer Zoe Collletti being the most memorable among them, as the film's plucky and relatable lead. Overall, I can't say that this is not a disappointment. Part of me still longs for Schwartz's stories to take center field, or at the very least, for the narrative tying them together to not be so painfully cliched. But what's here is decent, though the property deserved something far better.",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark
175,cappiethadog,"1968, a matrix",7,15 April 2021,"Three people are stranded on a deserted Alaskan island. They look out towards the sky at a twin-engine plane, piloted by Jack(Kris Kristofferson), a Port Henry local with a past, who has returned with a larger aircraft with extra seats. Joe Gastineau(David Strathairn) wonders aloud if the extra seats are for them, or occupied by the assassins who killed Bobby(Casey Siemaszko), his half-brother, an amateur drug smuggler. It's an overcast day without a trace in the sky. ""Limbo"", directed by John Sayles, ends with a close-up of the clouds, white like pages from an empty book, and the plane's whirring motor. It's one of the ""Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark"". How does it end?Stella Nicholls(Zoe Colletti) is a girl out of time, living in a small town out of time. It's the late-sixties, but in Mill Valley, Pennsylvania, the fifties hangover that was cured by The Beatles' stateside arrival and prevailing counterculture never got past the city limits. Vietnam unfolds on a black-and-white television. Richard Nixon's bid for the White House, too. But the conspicuous absence of sex, drugs, and rock and roll, and the social unrest that defined the late-sixties' post-slow decade swoon lollapalooza of happenings, makes the news at six look like transmissions from the future. It's Halloween night in Andre Ovredal's ""SSTTITD"" and Stella Nicholls(Zoe Colletti), a horror short story writer, is alone in her bedroom with all her stuff: B-movie posters, comic books, and monster memorabilia, stuff you normally associate with a guy, especially in the Summer of Love. The phone rings; it's Augie(Gabriel Rush), begging Stella to go trick-or-treating with him and Chuck(Austin Zajur), one final time before they go their separate ways after high school is over. As they walk through their quaint and somewhat anachronic neighborhood, it may strike the viewer that this small band of nerds, especially the boys, seem more like little kids than high school seniors. They're draft-eligible, most likely, but the most pressing matter on their minds is the prank that Chuck devised against Tommy Milner(Austin Abrams), the requisite town bully, and his letterman-jacketed lackeys, which involves eggs and flaming poo directed at the head honcho's car. The ensuing chase by foot ends at a drive-in, a mode of film exhibition more synonymous with the iconography of the fifties. It wasn't time for ""The Last Picture Show"", but a theater better delineates setting. Period detail, in ""SSTTITD"", is allocated from the diegesis, seemingly coming from a second authorial voice, somebody more mature with a better grasp of time and place than the creator. For instance, Donovan's ""Season of the Witch"" plays over the soundtrack(an extra-diegetic source) in the opening sequence to describe the literality of Stella's chosen costume, a witch, whereas the outside voice would better understand that ""witch"", as conveyed by Donovan Leitch, has more in common with social change than a woman with magical powers. George Romero's ""Night of the Living Dead""(non-diegetic insert) unspools on the drive-in screen when Stella meets Ramon Morales(Michael Garza), whose car she and her friends pile into, a disappearing act they pull on their Halloween night pursuers. Stella likes zombie flicks. She can quote and do the voice that goes with it. Using her best Sheriff McClelland(George Kosana) imitation, she says: ""All right, Vince, hit him in the head, right between the eyes,"" a memorable, but apolitical line, suggestive of a girl who misses the film's subtext: Vietnam and racial strife. ""Search and destroy,"" is military jargon; it's used by the newscaster, in reference to the zombies. ""Marauding ghouls,"" he calls them, or in other words...Does Stella pick up on this? In ""Night of the Living Dead"", it's the townsfolk who kill Ben(Duane Jones), not the zombies. The author may miss the allegory, but the extraneous voice doesn't. Like the African-American actor on the screen, Ramon is the ""other"". His exoticness is a non-issue for Stella, but it isn't for Chuck. Augie catches his friend's casual racism, apologizing to Ramon, who just saved their bacon, when Chuck asks the stranger: ""You're not from around here, are you?"" just like Police Chief Turner(Gil Bellows) at the gas pumps. Even worse, he sniffs Ramon's first, as if it stinks, perpetuating an ugly stereotype. Stella remains quiet all throughout this mini-drama, but celluloid speaks louder than words. ""Night of the Living Dead"" was shot in the same state, in a city probably not that far from this fictional town. Film historians credit George Romero with making the first modern horror movie. A graveyard would be more fashionable and contemporary, but Stella invites Ramon to the filmic world of Robert Wise's ""The Haunting"" and Jack Clayton's ""The Innocents"", a haunted house.Therein lies a fallacy to categorizing fiction and non-fiction as such, since both divisions involve storytelling, the novel and the memoir, respectively. Truth is always a subjective concept, one version; one point-of-view of real-time events. Gordie LaChance(Richard Dreyfuss) as an adult, in ""Stand by Me"", directed by Rob Reiner, writes a bildungsroman about the time he and his buddies made the journey to look at a dead body; a classmate who had been reported missing for weeks. There's no reason to doubt Gordie's remembrances, yet it's only human nature for the writer to gild the lily, so to speak, when describing one's self and one's friends. Taking Gordie(Will Wheaton) at his word that Chris Chambers(River Phoenix) encouraged him to keep on telling stories, therefore giving credit to the deceased friend for making him a successful writer, it would stand to reason, with a stroke of the mighty pen, that he change history and improve a troubled kid's legacy. Maybe Chris, in fact, did not return the stolen class money to the teacher, but kept it for himself. Based on the short story ""The Body"" by Stephen King from ""Different Seasons"", a collection of novellas, it's tempting to view Stella Nichols as a stand-in for King's wife, a novelist, telling the story of her own youth as a young artist. There are echoes, no doubt, to ""Stand By Me"". Stella has her own one-person rooting section, as well, in the form of Augie, who encourages his classmate to submit her short stories for publication in the school newspaper. Is it an answer film, in code? Stella, a genre film fangirl, could be Mrs. Gordie LaChance, except for the fact that this fictional Pennsylvania town looks more like a matrix of the Summer of Love than the real thing, written by somebody who wasn't alive, but only heard about the sixties. So maybe not. So who is?Joe Gastineau, in ""Limbo"", was a high school basketball star, before he blew out his knee, and became a career drifter. John Wooden, the legendary head coach at UCLA, had sent one of his scouts all the way to Alaska. Noelle(Vanessa Martinez), the daughter of a lounge singer, Donna DeAngelo(Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio), makes regular visits to the trophy case at her high school that saved all the hardware of a could-have-been never-was. The year was 1968, the same unfolding year in ""SSTTIND"". Noelle has a puppy love crush on her mother's boyfriend. For Stella Nicholls, it's the new kid in town. When Stella and her two surviving friends, Ramon and Chuck, fool the front desk nurse and penetrate the restricted area at the mental hospital, it's Ramon who disposes of the clipboard and adjoining forms in the swing door trashcan like a basketball star scoring two with panache, a thunderous dunk. Chuck stays behind while Stella and Ramon go to the Red Room(an acronym for Records and Evaluations Department), where they go through old boxes to learn the truth about Sarah Bellows, the spirit who haunts her childhood home, a manor. Stella, unwittingly, becomes the custodian of the dead woman's short stories. She took the book from Sarah's room. To her surprise, the author is still active, writing new tales from the afterlife in blood; her own blood, a work-in-progress that foretells the death of everybody in Stella's universe, both friend or foe. Everybody's lives, you could say, are in limbo, all dependent on the whims of a, literally, tortured artist. Sarah's family institutionalized, then killed her with repeated electro-shock treatments, torture disguised as therapy. Noelle, in ""Limbo"", cut herself, little slices under her arm where it joins the shoulder. Blood droplets stained the paper she wrote her stories on. Noelle was a short story writer, just like Stella. On that uninhabited island, Noelle discovers the diary of a similarly-aged girl who lived in the same shack that the castaways use as shelter. Every night, over a campfire, Noelle reads an entry to her mother and Joe. When the narrative inevitable ends, she picks up where her predecessor left-off. The mother discovers Noelle's secret, and is immediately dismayed by the emotional and physical violence of her daughter's storytelling.Noelle is the author of ""SSTTITD"". She slips into Sarah Bellow's skin. Ramon is a stand-in for Joe, her unrequited love. It's 1968, the year of free love, but it feels more like 1958 when Noelle doesn't join Ramon on her bed, but instead gives him his marching orders to the basement, but not without a pillow, sheets, and a warm blanket. Noelle, most likely, was intact, so, too, is Stella. Noelle doesn't have the skillset to write about intimacy with a man. ""SSTTITD"" could have been the first thing she wrote after being rescued.""Limbo"" had a happy ending, after all.Think of Tabitha King, the author of ""One on One"", a novel about love and basketball, as Noelle's mentor. ""Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark"" is a collaboration. The film has a cornfield and a clown, or rather, a Pierrot, according to Augie, and a haunted house that resembles The Overlook. Imagine Noelle reading ""Children of the Corn"", ""It"", and ""The Shining"" with the fairer King reading over her head.",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark

The story would have been interesting if she terrorized descendants of her sadistic, abusive brothers, who now occupy the ancestral home, and awaken Sarah Bellows' spirit and wrath through The Book.

It relies a bit too much on computer-generated imagery for my liking, which was especially disappointing given the attachment of Del Toro to the project. Still, the production design and creatures manage to be memorable and constitute the primary draw for the film. I'm also always a fan of the small-town-on-Halloween setting for a horror film. There's something about the crunch of fallen leaves, buttoned jackets over plaid, and amber-hued scenery that tickles my nostalgia centers. Still, I can't justify giving this film more than a mild recommendation mainly due to the somewhat limp characters. They're serviceable and the young actors do a fine job with the material, but the characterizations lack the depth necessary to motivate investment beyond a superficial admiration of the production design. The overarching story, too, fails to really rise above the minimum quality standards. It's spooky, but slight.Strong 3/5",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark

As a child I think the only thing that would have scared me is the lady absorbing that kid, which is my favorite part of this movie, the rest is this forced plot to explain how the book is magic or something and the sad storie of the girl who wrote it, I could have done without this, it would have been much better if it was just an anthology film and the stories weren't connected at all, with it all smashed together in one story they cant really put a lot of focus or time on any given one, kinda lame.

Like the books, this film contains a fair amount of visceral creepiness and graphically frightening scenes. In addition to the obvious ""teen angst,"" there are the obligatory horror images of skeletons, a scarecrow, corpses, overfed rats, bodies, and ghosts. There are enough moments to make you shudder, even jump out of your comfortable chair, but there's also a friendly ""Michael Dougherty"" (Trick 'r Treat) type of poetic irony and adolescent humor which strategically siphons out some of the intensity when certain events take place.""Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark"" boasts a fluid, easy to follow story line, combined with a diverse, credible cast.

184,Benslie,Would have been better as a TV Show,5,11 August 2019,"First of all, I will admit that in a few cases that the CGI in this film was okay but I do know that they also used makeup to help make these creatures and whenever it was practical it looked well done. I've seen multiple things online comparing the creatures in the film to those in the book and you can see the level of detail the make-up people put into making them look as if they just popped right out of the book. As much as I want to say this film is scary it honestly isn't. You can tell right away when a jump scare is about to happen because it's such a cliché way. I will say that there was one point where I felt like I was going to vomit but it was one moment out of I don't know how many. The pacing in this film is another big problem with this film. The film is one-hour and forty-one-minutes long and you feel it. The plot moves at a snail pace speed and the film keeps coming up with dumb ways to keep making the film longer. Like I said in the intro this feels like a long episode of a kids show like Goosebumps or Are You Afraid of the Dark and it probably would have been better as a two-part episode of one of those shows. The acting in this film was mediocre at best and I couldn't really care about any of these characters. I don't want to say which person it was but there was one character that could have been better recasted. In the end, I feel like this could have worked best as a TV Show than a full-length film. It ends off with a possible sequel that I think will never happen. I give Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark a 5.5/10.",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark

186,Amthermandes,"Made for kids, based on a book for kids, not a proper tribute to the original books, but it's decent",6,25 September 2021,"First of all, on a personal note, the original books are THEE reason I got into horror in the first place. My earliest memories include those camping alone or with friends in my backyard in a tent, and reading these stories, and gleefully getting freaked out not just by the stories themselves, but by the twisted, atmospheric illustrations by the great Stephen Gammell.Secondly, the film does NOT make a worthy enough tribute to the original stories. Sure, once during the film there's a slight nod to Gammell when one actress is walking across a stage, and further in the end credits, but that's it.They try to mix and match the original stories, in hopes that it sticks. And by using a gratuitous amount of cheap CGI, they thought they could win over the newer generation along with the generation that grew up on the original stories.They fell FAR from achieving the latter. It's still a fun, light (not Hocus Pocus ""light,"" but more like a lighter version of the newer renditions of ""It,"" or even like the ""Goosebumps"" series) . WAY too much CGI, not enoughh dependence on practical effects certainly crippled the film. Along with poor acting for half of it (the actors stepped it up some in the second half, but the first half leaves a lot to be desired), the film falls way short of brilliance.Good enough for a Friday night with friends, but not good enough to consider a fair adaptation.",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark

189,quiqueperezsoler,"What if stories could physically hurt us? Eerie, grotesque and haunting. Doesn't redefine the horror genre but stays faithful to the source material in many aspects",8,20 March 2020,"Following the trending formula that media like ""Stranger Things"" and ""IT"" brought back of horror-mysteries featuring a cast of young kids in a larger-than-life scenario, this movie provides another entry with perhaps some of the most creative horror creatures brought from the novel it is drawing inspiration from. The story is thrilling as well as chilling, it recycles tropes of the genre but it shies away from being repetitive by providing new angles, decent characters, haunting stories and a deeper story that leads to believe.I believe the negative reviews of this movie come from the more horror veterans who were raised by these kinds of books and find the adaptation lacking. I'm a child from the mid-90s and tried all my life to stay away from horror ever since I opened a Goosebumps book from my school's library fooled by the artistic cover and unaware that it was a scary story. Nevertheless, as of late, I have rediscovered an inexplicable attraction to Stephen King and John Carpenter's horror which has encouraged me to dig more into the genre. Although I tend to feel a bigger fascination with the more novelty or ""spooky"" mystery-horror stories fueled by fantasy and folklore-inspired creatures and stories. This movie provides exactly what I like most, a story in the realm of Dark Fantasy and story-based monsters that haunts kids. There's no doubt Guillermo del Toro was the best choice to guide the visuals of the movie.I might have entered late into the game but I'd express my opinion nonetheless and this movie tackles exactly the more traditional tropes of horror while introducing new monsters. This movie shines for its cohesive and ""easy going"" plot structure with creativity at the center of it. I found Guillermo del Toro's unique dark fantasy touch in a compelling story that feature kids overcoming something bigger than reality provides a unique spin to well-known tropes of traditional horror. Given it has a PG-13 rating this movie couldn't benefit from the gore and some of the more mature themes but overall it didn't need them. It does feel at times like a compilation of darker Goosebumps episodes in that this movie tackles the short stories in the novel of its name with a compelling setting and well-enough fleshed out characters that become engaging with only but a few scenes and interactions. Although, some backstories and mystery build up lack some in-depth explanation that could have benefited the narrative. The sort of treatment perhaps a more serial production would have been able to flesh out better and could have helped the stories to cause a bigger impact in the characters' lives and thus the audience.The overall insertion of a backstory needed in order to fuel the nightmares released by the book the kids find is not original but it is well developed. The theme of the power of stories and the essay on ""what if stories could literally hurt us"" that wraps many aspects of the plot and the characters themselves is profound and eerie for some.The movie doesn't abuse the use of jump scares or easy gimmicks to scare the audience but rather tries to build the scary moments with tension and imagery. In my opinion, the movie misses some of the possible more deeper lessons to be taught to the characters that encounter a product of the book as instead of making it a personal attack on a vain personality trait to be a victim of it chooses to simply scrach the surface and opt for a more extravagant creature. Also I found a lack of ""diversity"" on the different horror products created in the books as most of them are merely monsters to run away from instead of metaphorical or ominous. As if the movie was trying to pull away from more psychological monsters born from depression and other as they may haunt the PG-13 audiences more.IN CONCLUSION, for beginners of the horror-mystery genre that found ""watchable"" media like Stranger Things, IT and Goosebumps; this movie is an addition to that list to entertain, introduce the short stories book to the audiences who didn't know about it before and, to some, scare with creative creatures, an uncommon but refreshing setting found in the late 60s (instead of the traditional 80s and 70s) and a well developed story that feels cohesive, daunting and haunting. Although it is undeniable the similarities with the Goosebumps movie and, all in all, the movie has a tendency to fuel the horror aspects of it through mild mystery build-up invoking the familiar tropes of laboratory experiments, haunted houses, cursed books and bad omens to present it. I recommend this movie to teenagers, horror newcomers and fans of classic horror tropes that rejoice at a new interpretation or portrayal of those to tell a new story.

The only redeeming qualities that saves it from a very low score are the sound, 30% of the cinematography and that they've put so much love and care to the monsters, so that they can be very faithful to the illustrations by Stephen Gammell that were in the book with some impressive makeup, but everything else from the story, characters, dialogue, acting, a lot of the cinematography, music and the visual effects (or CGI) wasn't all that good.

193,Kirollos-Noah,An entertaining horror movie,7,31 October 2019,"Happy Halloween, and welcome to my review of Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark, based on the bestselling series of books, a horror movie for younger genre enthusiasts.Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark was directed by André Øvredal, screenplay by Dan Hageman, Kevin Hageman, Guillermo del Toro and story by Marcus Dunstan, Patrick Melton, based on Alvin Schwartz's novel.The movie takes place on Halloween 1968, reclusive Stella and her two friends meet a mysterious drifter, Ramón, and uncover a sinister notebook of stories.I wasn't really anticipating this movie, the books are fun, like Goosebumps, but scarier with less sense of humor, and the movie did justice to the source material. Actually this movie surprised me, I think it's a good horror movie, good performances -not from everybody-, and good sense of humor.Let's start with the performances, most if the young actors were great, Zoe Margaret Colletti as Stella Nicholls stole the whole show, she's so talented, yet her character is so predictable, but she managed to make her very entertaining to watch, sometimes even emotional! Also Austin Zajur did a very good job as Chuck Steinberg, he gave the movie an amazing sense of humor, though he wasn't that great in some of the serious moments, but he's funny, and that added a great humor to the movie.Michael Garza as Ramón Morales is the worst aspect of this movie, he was so soulless, I didn't feel, even a little bit, his character, though it has a good twist towards the end that felt bad and misplaced because of his acting, he wasn't convincing enough to make you at least care for him, I don't like trashing an actor's performance, but Garza her did a terrible job in this movie, and sadly, there's a lot of him in this movie! Also Natalie Ganzhorn as Ruth Steinberg didn't quite deliver, but this time, it's not Ganzhorn's problem, it's the character, it's so cliched and predictable, and so boring, but fortunately there's not that much of her character in this movie, and I hope they redeem her in the sequel, if they decided to make one, which is very likely there's going to be one.The movie is as creepy as it can get, though it might not reach that much of creepiness, even for a PG-13 movie, but this is a good horror movie, it has some good sequences, such as the pale fat woman, which is my favorite part, that sequence is so scary, though it didn't last much, but the make-up and everything about that woman was so scary, even for adults, I'm saying this because lots of people are trashing this movie for its concentration on the younger audiences, and on a way it does, but also it didn't bore or humiliate the ""intelligence"" of the adults as well!The movie is very predictable, and you could tell that you've seen this before, and to be honest it was annoying sometimes how this movie is so like some other movies, but the movie has a few unexpected things that occurred, if you didn't read the books, you'll be very surprised by it, and also the movie is still fun, besides all of its predictability, because of the tension and the cinematography of this movie, it's very entertaining, and pretty good to look at, but not from the CGI perspective, from the cinematography's perspective!The CGI in this movie is very distracting, it's really poor, and they tried to hide that, by showing those CGI-ed creatures in the night, but even though, it was still very obvious and very distracting.Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark isn't going to scare most of the adult moviegoers, but it's going to entertain them, and be spooky from time to time, but it's going to be really creepy to the younger audiences, and that was their target at the first place, just like the book.Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark isn't a flawless or a perfect movie, it's even hard to call it a great movie, but it's fun enough to keep you entertained. while it suffers from lack of good performances from some of the actors, distracting CGI and some of the dialogue, but still well acted by its lead, well-shot and also creepy.I'm gonna give Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark a B.Happy Halloween, it's so close, get your costumes and your pumpkins ready and enjoy the holiday with your family and friends.

195,helenbassett,Scary Stories To Tell In The Dark Film Review - André Øvredal Directs Things That Go Bumps In The Night With An Unappetising Stew,7,9 September 2019,"I didn't read the Scary Stories To Tell In The Dark books by Alvin Schwartz as a kid, not even sure the books were in the UK, so director André Øvredas's film version was my first look at the creepy tales. Strung together with a group of misfits in 1968 small town America, and crafted like the scary films I watched as a teenager. Nightmare On Elm Street was probably the biggest horror franchise of the time.The misfits are chased to a drive-in movie one Halloween where they hide out in Michael Garza's car. When it's safe to leave, his Ramón, the new kid in town, and hiding from the police, joins the teenagers to visit a haunted house. The Bellows family, large employers in the town long ago had a secret that they kept hidden in their now decaying mansion.And when bully Tommy and his gang find and lock them in, well they might as well explore. Austin Zajur's Chuck gets his own private scare in the closet. I would have liked that to have been more explored. But they all eventually find themselves in the room that daughter Sarah Bellows was kept. Writing her stories that she then read out through the wall to the local kids. Just before they died. And creating the local legend of her being a witch.Horror fan Stella, played by Zoe Margaret Colletti, finds Sarah's book and takes it home when the door to the room is mysteriously opened. She invites Ramón to sleep at hers as his car has been trashed by Tommy, and they discover a new story in the book. Freshly written in blood!Meanwhile Austin Abrams's Tommy back home has chores to do, you almost feel sorry for the teenage bully. Especially as he has to do his chores under the watchful gaze of scarecrow Harold. Tommy has never been very nice to Harold, if he had been then maybe the new story wouldn't have been about him. He'll be spitting straw.With Tommy missing Stella gets the group together to talk about what she thinks happened. A little unbelievable they agree, although Harold is wearing Tommy's clothes!But Sarah's ghost has been awakened and has only just begun, with her menacing and vengeful shadow ever present. And Gabriel Rush's Auggie is next in her book. The story with the unappetising stew. The work of Guillermo del Toro is clearly noticeable in the wandering zombie. She's looking for something!Chuck's sister Ruth, played by Natalie Ganzhorn, was also trapped in the Bellows House when 'boyfriend' Tommy pushed her in, and she gets her own story. A big red spot on her cheek that grows bigger and then erupts. Not one for the arachnophobiac sufferers in the audience. And poor beauty queen Ruth gets to potentially live out what happened to Sarah. Although not as brutal it seems.Time for Stella, Ramón and Chuck to visit the hospital where Sarah was kept. Although Chuck will do anything to avoid a red room. His dreams have been telling him to stay away from it. Best stick together then! His own story involves a pale lady who has eaten all the cakes and really needs a hair wash. And she's very hungry. To be honest none of the stories are too scary for teens.And then there were two, as Stella and Ramón have to face their own nightmares, helpfully provided by Sarah. With Stella perhaps facing the greatest fear in a case of mistaken identities. The only way to stop Sarah is for Stella to write her ending.With his good cast André Øvredal has, with his Production Designer David Brisbin, created an America caught up in the Vietnam war and the Halloween styling and comedy of ET. With potentially more scares for teens than Goosebumps Halloween, it will be interesting to see what film makers release for them this Halloween, as this would have been perfect. Probably the biggest will be The Addams Family, but with not quite the same style scares available in animation form.",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark

At last comes a genre film that finally lifts the benchmark for the other 90% of tired, lazy efforts calling themselves horror entries nowadays. Imaginative, original, it's solidly creepy and unnerving at times and the film wears it's heart on its sleeve to boot. It has a wonderful presence which is almost blissful to be caught up in. The period detail is effective and works in well, the characters are well drawn and not alienating, even the music score is at once haunting and mesmerising for such a production. Everything just fits and works and it's frankly astounding to actually be impressed and spirited away for once by such a vehicle. The only complaints, however minor would be that the film is slightly underlit in places, however it doesn't last long as it's makers knew when to turn the lights back on for certain plot devices and some great set pieces, of which there are many. Also the interior self-written stories could have been slightly expanded upon and padded out, but overall these are minor flaws.The people behind this picture and probably the stalwart figure who produced, must have gotten together and said ""lets do this right"" (given that the industry and the studios have succumbed to the eternal concept of PG horror fare, they have created a work which slots agreeably into that format but at the same time has ironed out all it's tired cliches and brought forth something rich and renewed).

Even just to review this movie, I almost couldn't find the strength for my mind to arrange the perfect words to describe it, it's just a disappointment to me. Having an almost similar core story with ""The Autopsy of Jane Doe"" (because same director, that's why), doesn't mean it has the same scariness level. But despite all of that, props to the costume designer for bringing some of the monsters (or ghosts/demons/devils? dunno) to life and making it looks really real and scary.

First of all, I don't know the original books, so I can't tell if this is a faithful adaptation or not. But I don't think that matters, because this film sucks.
The acting sucks hard; the script is something a teen would wrote, not an experienced writer like Guillermo; and omg the creatures look horrible (and not in a good way), even Eric Bana's Hulk looks better than they do.
Don't really know why they didn't make an anthology film, because I have read that the original stories in the books are like 2 pages long, so this could've been something ala V/H/S or Black Sabbath or Creepshow, that way maybe the movie would've made more sense.

With such a great original material and his producing list (we have El orfanato and Los ojos de Julia, as examples), Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark seems to be an easy A for an avid horror watcher like me. However, as wrong as it sounds, I feel disconnected with the final result.Scary Stories brought a premise that instantly remind us to the premise of Goosebumps adaptation, although both have different approach, the premise ""book comes alive"" was used to make some of their greatest stories compiled in one feature. All of Scary Stories segments are creative in jumpscares, and all of them build to a hyped climax as the characters studying the origin of the book. Unfortunately, the buildups are justified with only a climax that took a dramatic approach, in contrast to the violent and heartless scenes. I am not personally condemn this, but since each segments manage to keep me anticipate the next scare, the climax was so watered down and unable to make those sequences stronger.I must admit this movie is so serious to make the 1960s set, along with the timeline and social and political references throughout the movie. But for me it leaves no mark since at the end, they never fully used in the plot. Other than that, I like the jumpscares and this movie makes me bought the book series yesterday. So, in a way this movie is not that awful. However, this is coming from del Toro and I am a huge fan of his El laberinto del fauno and I expect great and new things in here. Probably, it's just the original short stories format that constrain him to elaborate those segments into a whole movie with linear plot.

211,rustonreviews,"High on charm, light on scares.",6,5 September 2019,"Produced by Guillermo del Toro and based upon the popular short story collections written by Alvin Schwartz and illustrated by Stephen Gammell, Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark centers around a group of young teens in Mill Valley, Pennsylvania in 1968, who discover an old leather bound book of short horror tales. What initially begins as an intriguing find soon becomes a nightmare as stories begin to manifest on the pages right before their eyes. Written in blood by an invisible entity, each new story transforms individual members of the group into ill-fated protagonists, leaving Stella (Colletti), an ametuer writer and horror fanatic, to uncover the books dark secrets before her own fatal story is written.Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark is an enjoyable enough horror tale with a likable cast and a few fun set pieces, but the problem here is that, despite its title, it's staggeringly light on actual scares. Rather than a chilling horror anthology in the same vein as Trick R Treat (2007), Scary Stories feels more like a teen centric incarnation of Goosebumps (2015). There are a few noteworthy sequences to be found here. Harold (the poster star) is a sinister villain and his sequence is fairly chilling and packs a pretty grim finale, but everything that follows this sequence is far too tame to warrant being labelled as a 'scary story'. Most every story featured in the film aren't particularly interesting when looked at in isolation, but they're serviceable enough within the context of the overarching narrative. The introduction of a fully CGI villain in the third act feels far too cartoonish to be taken seriously, therefore removing any tension or menace that could have been achieved. As for the finale, everything is resolved suddenly and lacks all the terror a good horror finale needs, making for a dull, underwhelming ending. One thing the film gets truly right, however, is bringing Gammell's haunting illustrations from the books to life.

It's another over-hyped horror movie like IT. It's actually more of a fantasy film than horror. The concept is poor at first place. Seriously are stories killing people in 2019? People who liked it need to get their taste right in movies. And after all the crazyness, the ghost gets melted by some emotional talk from the actress and it all stops. Wow I'm seriously impressed!

If we repeat them often enough, they become real. They make us who we are. They have such power, This, I learned, on the very last autumn of our childhood.""Now, not saying I found this film profound, but this quote really stood out to me and I really appreciate it. What was profound was the lead actress, Zoe Colletti, as Stella. Not that this film needed superb performances, but hers was. I hope she has a successful career ahead of her because she put so much emotion toward her character, emotion I didn't want or needed. Colletti has so much potential and I would love to see her in another film that could really let her show her talents.AThat being said, the big let down of the movie was all the unnecessary exposition with the characters. Thankfully those scenes didn't overstay their welcome, but I honestly didn't find myself caring or rooting for any of the characters. A little backstory is okay, but when it comes to horror films, I'm ready to get scared, not to get bored. There was enough balance in the film, and as far as bad horror movies go, this actually wasn't that bad. It's not a go-to Halloween flick, but I at least enjoyed. But that cliffhanger at the end- really? I don't care, just end it.I own the books in which this film was based off of. I did recognize some references and stories, and I thought this film had a creative take on the original source material. And I actually got scared.

As a huge fan of André Øvredal (director of Trollhunter & Autopsy of Jane Doe), expected it bit more twisted & eerily creepy particularly around the different monster/entity encounters at different segments. Among the ghostly entities, The Jangly Man & The Pale Lady were the most interesting; and while they could have done more with The Pale Lady (looked like a creepy character from a Japanese manga), the intro to this character was kind of disappointing & somewhat same like Harold the Scarecrow. The Jangly Man was the most satisfactory one...wondering what James Wan would have do with it?! Speaking of Wan, at times it just came to my mind that considering the format & the stories...I think Wan or Mike Flanagan would have been a better choice for this film than Øvredal.It got potential to be more darker, scarier & entertaining but PG-13 approach turned out to be a let down for me.

This film is fun and a ""lighthearted"" horror/thriller. There are frightening scenes and images. It is enjoyable for teenagers as well as adults. Young audiences may be scared by the film.

Somehow, the movie has more mystery and character depth to the supernatural antagonist, Sarah Bellows, than its lead characters. Coupled by the unnecessary and unexplored political undertones of the late 60s, the script fails to present proper parallels to the lead characters of Stella, Ramon, Auggie, and Chuck to the antagonist Sarah and the political undertones. The writing leaves so much to be desired. The characters are mere caricatures. Zoe Colletti, who plays Stella, is a standout though among the cast. The movie is saved only by the horror which is built up throughout the movie as the mystery of the book, and legend unfolds. The scarecrow, red room and prison scenes, and the finale are all legitimately terrifying. Nothing else of note to praise.4/10",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark

247,imjaredross,A Decent Horror Film for Teens That Don't Want a Hard R,6,1 October 2019,"Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark is based on the beloved book series of horror short stories. I never read these growing up, but I knew many people that did. I do however remember the gorgeous and yet disturbing art found in those books and when I heard a movie was being made based on these books my mind jumped to ideas of how they could adapt this to the screen. After seeing the film I found myself disappointed, but still enjoyed my time.The film instead of following the formula of many other movies before it made up of a collection of little shorts, instead tries to tell its story through a traditional narrative with teens in the 1960s coming across a book that produces the haunts found in the series. I would have much preferred this film as a series of shorts, but what we get here is for the most part pretty decent.The acting in the film is all around pretty good from the young actors who we are spending the majority of our time with. However the same cannot be said for their characters which are often boring and a bit generic, but we're not here for characterization are we? We're to have a good time and be scared. Well, I can safely say the film delivers mostly on that promise.The film opts for a hard PG-13 still making it accessible for teens and younger audiences without making it super violent. The scares and the imagery of the film are unique and interesting with great designs taken from the book that are then translated on the screen. There's a couple of great and tense moments in the film. It's just a shame that I really don't have a connection to these characters even by the end.Also something I found odd in the film was the time period. Now the film is set in the late 60s, but aside from some of the ways people dress and come things in the background I wouldn't be able to distinguish if this was the 1960s or 2019. It does a poor job at really putting you in that time period.Even with that said, the film remains fun and creative with some good moments sprinkled throughout. I just wished I cared a little more and that the film tried for a different way to tell its story. Still a fine film nonetheless.",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark

252,WillsFilms,Scary Stories To Tell In The Dark Reads Very Well,7,23 August 2019,"Scary Stories To Tell In The Dark is an incredibly fun movie that I highly recommend to everyone. This film has creative visuals and monsters, intresting and likeable characters and great writing. Zoe Colletti, as the main character; Stella Nicholls, delivers an incredible performance for someone so new to the film industry. During the climax of the movie, her acting is so outstanding that I'd honestly say it's the best performances from a young actor or actress I've ever seen. Stella is also a very interesting character with a lot of depth and a well written character arc that carries the movie and makes it so good. Michael Garza is also amazing as the movie's male lead; Ramón Morales, who is another very interesting character, with the most compelling character arc in the movie. His backstory is tragic and makes you sympathise a lot with him. The movie also has one of the best villains I've ever seen in a horror movie. Sarah Bellows is, by far, the best character in the movie with a mysterious backstory that unveils as the movie goes on. The plot twist regrading her backstory is so good that I can't spoil it, but it's such a great scene that you'll walk out of the movie thinking about Sarah the most. The film also manages to use jumpsacres effectively, with the tension before the scares being built up incredibly well, mostly thanks to film's incredible cinematography. Because of this, the scariest parts of the movie are the tension before the jumpsacres, rather than the jumpsacres themselves. The monsters in the movie are also incredibly creative, with amazing, disturbing designs. However, this is sometimes ruined by the movie's rather poor CGI.And that leads into my problems with this movie. As previously mentioned, the CGI looks mediocre at best and terrible at worst. The poor effects often take away from the scariness of the scenes with the monsters, because what we're looking it looks so fake that it looks more funny than scary. Another problem is every character that isn't the two leads or the villain. Austin Zajur as Chuck Steinberg does get the occasional funny line, but often his comedic scenes take place so soon after a horrific monster scene that it causes the film to have problems with its tone. Every other character is just an annoying jerk who doesn't believe the main characters when they try to tell them about the stories. There's also a generic bully character, but he's not in the movie for that long so he doesn't drag it down too much.Overall, Scary Stories To Tell In The Dark is a fantastic movie with interesting main characters, an amazing villain, phenomenal visuals, well done scares and creative monsters, slightly let down by annoying side characters and less than impressive CGI. However, the negatives are not enough for me to not recommend this movie. It's a fantastic horror film and I want you all to go and see it.",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark

There are storyboards, script revisions, and re-takes. But that is not how this movie came to be. This film was created by a blender. Yes, a blender, like in the kitchen. The only two ingredients used were ""Stranger Things"" and stupidity.The story takes us back to a questionable 1968, being as it feels more like the 1980s. It has a real ""Stranger Things"" vibe of a group of nerdy, outcast friends who have walkie-talkies and face monsters and evil in their small town; only difference being that the Netflix series has more developed characters instead of the cookie-cutter kids here.The ""scary stories"" actually end up being the film's biggest failure. They are absolutely ridiculous, which takes away from the creepy feeling that makes you think, ""It could happen to you."" The monsters end up being so cheesy that they are almost comical.The one thing the movie does do right is give the lesson that just because someone is a victim, doesn't mean they are necessarily a good guy. But other than that the whole thing is a ripped-off mess of cliches.""Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark"" is not scary, and for what it's worth we never actually get told a whole story in the dark.

258,nmn34,A Jarring But Positive Experience,8,11 August 2019,"I have mixed feelings coming out of this movie. Not so much in how I felt about the movie, on the whole I liked it. I just don't know who this movie is meant for. When they are using stories from the source material, the movie is great. Even terrifying. When its not, more often than not its rather vapid. The story wants to be accessible to a younger audience so there isn't much intrigue and much of it is spoon fed so as to not confuse them. But the two parts seem to undermind each other.The monsters are excellent and handled well. Harold the Scarecrow, the Toe Eater, and especially The Pale Lady are well designed and do bring about a fair amount of dread. The Pale Lady in particular is very true to the illustrations in the book, but seeing her alive and moving is something else. She is truly revolting to look at with her rotund belly and wide, slit mouth. The Jangly Man rounds out the original cast with new content and manages to blend in well. I was unsure if he was in any stories when I saw him, but he really takes over the show once he arrives. While the Pale Lady was slow and cumbersome, he is fast and flexible and really becomes a contender.The rest of the story doesn't pan out as well in comparison. While the other scenes play like Tales from the Crypt, the main story moves like Goosebumps. Kids aren't going to understand Vietnam and the presidential election of Richard Nixon so they try to keep it simple. Characters make simplified assertions and just go with it because that is what kids would understand. This doesn't lend well for adults however. Its all kind of background noise as you wait for the next monster story.But therein lies an issue. Who is this for? Other than fans of the books of course, the story is too childish for horror buffs and the scares too atmospheric and hard hitting for kids. Now the book has had this reputation, but it never had scenes of impalement or being absorbed, at least not as graphically. One kid starts turning into a scarecrow, him coughing up straw like he's vomiting blood after being stabbed with a pitchfork was brutal even for me.

In fact, the scenes are so boring and dull you start to wonder what you are going to have for dinner more than what is going on in the scene. The characters are forced on you and there is no development so you truly don't care about their impending dangers.

I could see this film gain a cult following and maybe end up having a trilogy or even more movies. The fact that this movie doesn't have a lot of star power is another reason why I enjoyed it.

They feature a book that links all the stories but unlike Creepshow, this book writes the destiny of the characters and how they would die. The creature effects and make up is perfect. All the creatures in the trailer are great to see in full action, and the most menacing is ghe Jangly Man. The setting is used brilliantly to increase fear. This was particularly well done in The Red Room segment. The acting is decent, but the deaths and horror scenes are so intense you actually pity the more annoying victims, and one villainous character. The resolution seemed too easy, but the climax was great. Some scenes seem slow, but it is only to help drive the narrative and the teen romance angle seemed forced. But it does not affect the story overall. Yet, despite the flaws, it is a great znthologh horror and I might even pay to watch it again.",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark

268,ShanTeaTime,Sleepover Horror Flick Captures Creatures From Its Source Material,5,15 August 2019,"Based on the children's book series of the same name by Alvin Schwartz. ""Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark"" follows a group of teens having to face their fears in order to save their lives.I did indeed grow up with these books throughout my middle school childhood. They terrified me, specifically the illustrations terrified me. Seriously look them up in their black-and-white glory. That being said, I had no clue what the plot was in this considering the book is just consisted of short stories. What it wound up being felt very ""It"" inspired with a small group of kids trying to escape the terror that is bestowed upon them. Pretty 'cut and paste' plot to be honest, but it had just enough to keep it afloat.I would describe this as a good ""campfire horror"", meaning it's intended purpose is to be watched in the dark and with friends during a sleepover. We get good chemistry between the kids in the film and some decent horror elements. Leave it to Guillermo Del Toro to utilize practical prosthetics and effects in this. It just makes everything so much scarier that way, I'm a huge fan of practical effects. Though because of this whatever isn't practical is very noticeable.We get some cool sequences in this movie, one non-horror example would be seeing the kids running through the drive-thru. I like scenes like that in film, it's also a smart way to introduce a new character. When it comes to the horror elements, they are pretty effective though some more than others (I found the corpse looking for her toe the most unsettling, though the scarecrow was pretty good too). Do not watch this film if you're squeamish, I'm warning you right now! We see a kid turned into a scarecrow pretty brutally, a human toe in stew, zit spiders, eww. It definitely will make you cringe.So I'll be moving onto the more negative critiques. Horror movies tend to have cliches and this movie doesn't steer clear of them. People can be so thick, seriously that kid was stupid for coming out from under the bed! Also don't ever EVER separate from your designated group in a horror scenario! Some of the dialogue in this is so cheesy/corny I had to stifle a snort. Also there's some questionable acting from 2 of the adult actors, Stella's father and the main cop. The dad's acting is really bad at times and I don't know why? I know he's a good actor from ""Breaking Bad"" so maybe he just wasn't given enough to work with? The cop character is just obnoxious, so poorly written and I just wanted him to get killed off so quickly.By the end, we are given a pretty open ending. So it's obvious they're hoping for the ability to make a sequel. I could see that happening, but I don't know how well it would be made. Either way, this movie was pretty average. Since 3 stars is average on my rating system I gave it that, it makes for a decent time and I'm sure fans of the book are alright with its portrayal of the creatures from the book.",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark

The creatures from the book and has been brought to the big screen has been well faithful and a lot of practical makeup are impressive to watch and even when there's CGI being used in this movie, it can blends well. And while the story is like Goosebumps, it still try to be it's own thing and I enjoyed it.The downside I have about the film is that while the cast did good job of performance, the character had little to no develop in this movie, some lines are cheesy and while the CGI can blend well for the creatures, that doesn't mean it's anything groundbreaking.Overall I still enjoyed the movie, it was faithful from the book, the performances was good, it was well shot, and the tension scene was palpable.",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark

It centers in 1968 Halloween and the Election is drawing to a close in a small Town in Pennsylvania where a small group of teens goes to a Haunted House and discovers a Book that has tales with a History.

285,Krush_Burner,The Never Ending Story Enters Into The Twilight Zone,7,7 August 2019,"This is Øvredal's second work in USA, but his directing here is clearly bears heavy influence of Guilermo del Toro, who is the main producer of this project. So the director's name is a bit misleading here, which become obvious as the story progresses and more and more typical del Toro's trademark themes are introduced. This is a version of coming of age story, wrapped in horror clothes, the tale of lost innocence and deliverance from past. The structure is taken from horror anthology, with several interconnected stories and wraparound story, but the basic difference is that here the characters trying to change their future and they're not mere observers or narrators.
The setting is classic: 1960s rural town with haunted house and other familiar locations, such as corn fields with scarecrows, mental asylum, and, of course, high school. What is a bit more surprising is a presence of a political context on the background: famous elections and subsequent winning of a Richard Nixon serves as a clear reference for current situation with Donald Trump's presidency. As for visuals, there's a lot of beautifully crafted monsters (my personal favorite is The Pale Woman from the hospital), albeit sometimes Øvredal wastes some great opportunity for a suspense building in favor of a direct jumpscares, which is somewhat disappointing.
However, since the story, acting and pacing are all good, total impression is rather satisfying. This is obviously not an adult horror, but if you take it as it is - a child's tale of supernatural forces and pains of grown-up - then you'll be rewarded.",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark

I am 41 now and the stories now seem like something Are you Afraid of the Dark or Goosebumps would do. I had the series of books and they were great when I was 8-10 and of course when you read your imagination makes them scarier not the stories themselves this is someone else's imagination or perspective of the story and they aren't scary at all. The whole thing could have been a TV hour long Halloween movie so its 40 minutes or so too long without achieving what the title promises. I don't know who this movie is for it's certainly not for young children, it would be lame for teens and adults will wonder what genre this fits in cause it's not a family movie and it's certainly not a horror movie by adult standards. I guess the pg-13 is actually right this time but I have a hard time thinking a teen would ask their parents to go see this.

The books always seemed to be like they were too gruesome for a kid, which I suppose was one of the things that made them so scary. For those who enjoyed the Goosebumps series but never read Scary Stories to Tell In the Dark, I can tell you the two do not compare. Scary Stories is genuinely scary.Instead of tying the stories into a central plot, I think the movie would have been served better by focusing on each story as a stand-a-lone story, similar to how the Twilight Zone movie did. The story of Harold is much more gruesome and is one of the more terrifying stories from that series, and I fell like it was not done justice by the haphazard way it was created in this film. The rest of the stories are also creepy as they are without trying to relegate it to some teenage-angst centered plot.",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark

I knew it was going to be visually stunning from the moment I saw Guillermo Del Toro, and it absolutely was. It was fun and nostalgic and it felt like the movie I wished Goosebumps had been a few years ago, rather than it taking the full on comedy approach. It was cute and definitely more kid-oriented than it would be for adults, which is understandable. Felt more like 90's Goosebumps episodes brought to today's world. But even with all this praise and nostalgia I felt, I must retract some points just for the fact that the monsters felt hollow and lifeless and more of a means to an end or some sort of ""scare factor"" rather than having some sort of character or purpose or personality. A lot of the meat of the stories in here was taken out and I felt the overarching narrative was drug our a little too much or too long. Wish they had focused more on the stories within and cut back a little bit on the overarching narrative. Still, it was fun and I enjoyed it. Looking forward to the coming sequel.

The film takes a little while to get to any parts that remind us of the scary stories that were so classic about the books. There is a lot of historical context and character development that sort of takes away from the simple spooky fun that the viewers show up for.
I did enjoy how several of the classic scary stories and illustrations are worked into the film and I was pleasantly surprised that some of the gore exceeded my expectations for the PG-13 rating.
However, as I said, the backstories and dramas of the main characters and the extra time and attention spent on the anchoring ghost story took much of the fun away and the ending is bit of a let down.

It tried to play itself like a genuine horror when it was more like a more thrilling goosebumps without the comedy. The acting was subpar,and the storyline was shallow so it didn't really have me invested in any of these characters. Something that scary stories did have going for it was really cool design on all of there monsters. It was creative and could've been scarier if they would've given them slightly more screen time.

302,cmills-98693,"Not quite dark, not quite campy.",4,27 August 2019,"Scary Stories is a fairly average horror flick that had moments of inspiration but was unfortunately undone by revealing too much in the trailers, and not truly utilising all of the stories monsters to their full extent.In the same way Batman vs Superman gave away the entire plot in one trailer, Scary Stories has done pretty much the same here. Everything seen in the trailers is what you see in the movie, right down to actual characters deaths, meaning that you barely feel invested in them whatsoever. Alongside this is the fact that each encounter is painfully short, 3/4 minutes at most and 1/3 of that is cut away to other characters, meaning there isn't enough time to build the tension required, also it cheapens itself by having to lower itself to jump scares to keep you from yawning.Additionally, the practical effects of a couple of the monsters meant they are by far the more enjoyable to watch and have on screen, but when the CG beasties arrive you're almost wondering if you're actually in an extended cut of 'Scooby Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed' because of how poorly animated moments are, and how poor the finished product is.Scary Stories is a decent movie for a single viewing, and is a film with a lot of potential if it decided it wanted to be a darker horror or a black horror-comedy but it chooses neither and tries to walk the tightrope between the two and falls off almost every time, the jokes aren't funny enough to pronounce it a comedy, and the horror element isn't scary enough to declare it a proper horror.Scary Stories falls into the same style of movies as Brightburn where there was great potential but poor execution, and while mildly enjoyable once certainly is not worthy of multiple returns to the movie theatre.",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark

Needless to say, they were a big part of my childhood and I was thrilled to see them finally come to life on screen. The good news is - the creature designs seem to have been done with minimal CGI and they are as unnerving and uncanny as the ones in those infamous illustrations we all grew up with. The bad news is - they're attached to a somewhat meandering and un-engaging wrap around story that gives its characters a personality a little too late.Three young kids and one random drifter break into the abandoned home of a suspected child killer on Halloween, find one of her rumored scary stories books, and fairly soon after that, new stories begin to form in the book as bizarre creatures come to claim new victims.It's not a bad idea to use as a springboard for all these creepy creations to show up, but the main characters don't give us much to hang on to and the film feels like it takes a bit too long to get to the good stuff and, once it does, we wait in anticipation for the next story to appear in between tedious scenes of the kids sleuthing in the local library or mental hospital to find clues about how to stop the evil from claiming them.There's lip service to issues of believing victims, money having the ability to bury wrongdoings, war violence, corrupt politicians, and people of color being thought of us bringers of black magic, but it doesn't say much profound about any of those and just feels like window dressing to make the film seem like it's more relevant than it really is.Scary Stories To Tell in the Dark is still pretty decent as PG-13 horror goes.

However, while ST can entertain a wider generational audience, Scary Stories... seem to be aimed only at teens. Which is fine. I just wished I was warned about it earlier.Overall the film is bland, generic and cliche ridden to the bone. Not even sure what I was doing more often, yawning or rolling my eyes.

They told me it is a horor movie but in the first 15 mins i knew it was not just a horor movie in fact it is not a horor movie.I am not a good writer. Never been. But i'll still try to tell what i think about the movie shortly. Because why not.
First of all, let me put it in this way. This is a mainly advanture movie but with alot of scary(ish) and comedy pieces in it. The reason why im saying scaryish is not because i found it not scary. But because of the main characters that makes the group of kids and all the American humor going on between them. We have this typical foolish cissy boy in the group who does stupid things, espacially when he gets scared. I am telling you, the movie starts with such a great energy you dont want it to ruin and trust me it wont. Anyway, the movie starts in a hallowen in 60s. All the mise en scene, music and sound fx gave it a Tim Burton kind of style for the first act. I dont know why but it just reminded me that. Then it has little bit of Stranger Things flavour. All these aside, in terms of the story and the cinematography, it was AWESOME. Anyway, I dont wanna keep this review too long.Even if you dont like any of these genres, just give it a chance.

322,gravegauze,Terrible premise.,5,14 August 2019,"Without giving anything of substance away, the film attributes the stories not to Alvin Schwartz, but to the fictitious ""Sarah Bellows"". The film centers around a legend not seen in the popular books that Sarah Bellows was locked away below the wealthy Bellows mansion and told kids on the outside her ""scary stories"". Not dumb enough? Okay. After the main characters confiscate the book and can't seem to get rid of it, the stories, which are supposed to be written in Bellows' own blood, write themselves speedily in front of the main characters' very eyes. They ""come true"", however, they are not completely true to the text, and this is even seen in the film.While you may see your favorite Schwartz tale a little butchered, for the most part, the film does a good job of portraying the characters and elements of the stories and bringing them to life.An underlying theme in the film, is that it takes place in 1968, and one of the first things you'll see in the film are Nixon/Agnew posters with the ""X"" in ""Nixon"" made into a swastika. It also conveys the horrors of the Vietnam War. With these underlying tones prominently throughout the film, it almost makes us feel like we should blame Nixon for the Vietnam War, even though we see him become elected on a television during the film. Nixon was not a great President, but he also obviously didn't start Vietnam.So with the poor premise that allows the film to incorporate the Schwartz stories into real life, the film is extremely cheesy. Lines such as, ""you don't read the stories, the stories read you"" and ""if we repeat them often enough (the stories), they become true"", make it more shuddering in a cringing sort of way - not a frightening sort of way.",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark

I cannot comment on the accuracy when comparing the books vs movies.Now on to the movie review....I can honestly say that the scariest part of this movie was the new commercial preview for ""IT"" haha.I was excited to see this movie where I am a very big fan of syfy and horror. To the point that i'll even watch, and like 3 star movies on Netflix and Amazon Prime. This movie was sooooo bad imo! Not once did I jump or feel anything that remotely resembles being scared. I think there was maybe 3 jump scares if I remember correctly, and they were still not good. I will say that the 3 star review comes from some pretty funny jokes in it. It almost seems like the movie tried to base itself entirely on the wierd art the book is known for. So every scenario seemed fast, and incomplete. What I mean is that all the monster parts in this happened in like a minute, and then it was over. Any attempt to be scary was negated due to the abrupt ending to the scenario, and they moved on. It seems like the spiders for example could have been scary if they added some more time setting it up, and also adding some more peril for the person involved.To be honest I was uncontrollably laughing during a large portion of the movie. Im not even joking...I was fighting the urge to let my laugh happen out loud, and had to step out of the theater to collect myself. One example is the big toe deal. The scenario itself is insane, but the reactions from the actors made it that much funnier. Its like in any horror where they do the wrong thing, and makes you shake your head. The ending had the same effect in how ridiculous it all was. I didn't have huge expectations per se, but it was so poorly done. Go see the movie if your bored, but I would wait for DVD.

I don't know if it's just me but I like watching horror movies that literally take place during Halloween. I think it was a great cast and I think it looked fantastic. Beautifully shot. I did not read the books but I still found it pretty scary and entertaining. Predictable at times sure but the creatures were great. Very Guillermo de Toro even though he didn't direct it. I literally kept expecting Hellboy to pop out at times. But this film was good because of the makeup and the design of the creatures and the stories told when each character died. It just looked really great. I recommend this movie because it's not a bad movie at all. Not perfect but great if you're a horror fan.,Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark
330,ViciousCXY,Good but expected more.,6,25 August 2019,"Stranger Things-esc with the suddenly trending retro themes, and similar concepts with a misfit group of kids fighting against supernatural beings.
Interesting and creative character design: Staying true to the style of Guillermo Del Toro, giving them a familiar style to that of the creatures in his story of Pan's Labyrinth.Throughout the movie there are stories added into the plot, which you think will be explored further, however end up being seemingly pointless, or just get forgotten as the film goes on: Such as the constant reoccurring factor of one of the main character's mother leaving for no apparent reason, which I personally thought would end up being tied into the spooky plot of the story, however ended up being a not-so-important detail, which was likely to just reinforce how much of a supposed 'outcast' the character is.
Another scenario like this, is how the character Ramón was painted as a mysterious character throughout the movie; living in his car, suddenly being in a new town whilst not knowing anyone, constantly being questioned by the police, etc. Again, this lead me to believe that he was running away from something, which was reinforced by the The Jangly Man repeatedly calling him a ""Coward"". However, yet again, in the end all of the story built up around this character seemed to just paint him out as another misfit, misunderstood kid.Overall, a good movie that I'd watch again; however, mostly to revisit the aesthetics of the movie. The film seemed to want to explore a lot of subplots, but just brushed them off to the side or gave no actual reason behind any of the build up - expected more than what was given.",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark

348,whineycracker2000,Offensive to fans of the books,2,9 August 2019,"Like many 80's kids, I grew up with these books, and they hold a special place in my heart. I should have listened to my heart when it told me that this film never should have been made so I am mad at myself for paying to see it. I guess this is on me, because, alas I did.I am speechless at how bad this film is. The original books left so much to the imagination but this film version has none and leaves no room for audiences to use theirs. Yes, I know it's a ""PG-13 horror film"", which has become a high-risk factor in the horror genre, but there are countless PG and PG-13 horror films that are far less gruesome yet outshine this wretched mess on every conceivable level: ""Get Out"", 2002's ""Mothman Prophecies"", and ""Dark Skies"" come to mind if we are citing more current films. In fact, some of the creepiest films ever made were designed specifically for kids (if you don't believe me, check out Disney's Watcher in the Woods from 1980 or Return to OZ from 1985).Technically the film is perfectly average. The musical score is recycled from every modern film of its type, cinematography stale, and the special effects out of place, as they undermine the books' old-fashioned sensibilities. Director André Øvredal claims that the film consists of almost all practical effects with a mere 10% CGI for ""enhancement"". You could have fooled me because nothing in this film feels ""practical"" in any way shape or form. This is anti-cinematic, contemporary fantasy (Guillermo's fingerprints are all over the film in the same way Spielberg's were on Poltergeist). Speaking of old-fashioned sensibilities, the film's depiction of small-town America, especially 60's America, is hollow and inauthentic. Every authority figure and adult character is an unlikable stereotype, each lacking the warmth and innocence you would find in a small town during that time period. The main teen characters are all stock, lacking any semblance of charisma or nuance, and speak in distractingly modern-day colloquialisms. These are kids of today that act and talk like kids of today.The film's ultimate misstep is by creating a completely unnecessary narrative thread designed to link all the disparate stories together. This adds absolutely nothing to the proceedings and results in the majority of the main characters spending half the film's running time reading aloud from books ""searching for the answers"" to help them destroy-whatever is-never mind, it doesn't matter. If this was a mystery, that would be one thing, -but it's a film based on one to two-page stories, intended to scare the living daylights out of its readers- and should have been presented strictly as an anthology (ala Creepshow). Scary Stories (stories and/or films) were meant to be visceral-to be experienced on a primal level-and I would expect a film based on famous books that did just that, to follow suit. Instead, Scary Stories seems more concerned with pandering solely to fans of ""Stranger Things"" and the ""It"" crowd (and just to be clear, there is nothing wrong with catering to a certain audience-in fact I AM that audience-but it shouldn't be at the expense of good filmmaking).I just hope the filmmakers of ""More Scary Stories"", which will inevitably happen, decide to take a more old-fashioned route and stick to the essence of what made the original books so eerily memorable.",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark
349,ShuhratGlazkov,Made me believe in the psychological horror again,7,26 August 2019,"Hello ThereAs someone who believes there is no such movie genre as ''psychological horror'' this movie made me believe in that. Knowing myself, this movie is probably and expection and when I go to see another movie that is also that ''genre'' I am pretty sure I will go back to my usual non-believer. But what made this movie so special is that the PG 13. My disappointment was immeasurable when I heard that movie was gonna be PG 13 for the first time but now I realize it was better. Since the movie was PG 13, they couldn't use blood so they depended heavily on the psychological side of the movie. Sure there are some jumpscares and stuff (nowadays nearly every horror movie has one jumpscare at least) but still the main focus of the movie is to frighten the audience slowly and slowly. Story starts very early in the movie (that is a fact I like) and unlike other horror movies there is a objective proof that some supernatural things are happening in the movie so all of our characters just unite and do their best to solve the mystery. So lets speak about our characters while we are here. My personal favourite was Chuck and it was probably because of the actor. Kid did such a better job when considered to his friends. And considering this was a PG 13 movie I really didn't think that they would kill the kids (I know the stories, and what happens in them but I still thought it would be a ''milder'' approach in the movie) but it happens man! I mean they did not really kill them but instead make them ''disappear'' mysteriously. Lastly, there were some plot holes in the movie. Like there are just our girl and his boyfriend and a cop in the police station and then the police dies and our characters escape the station with a police car. I know there was a monster involved in the situation but other cops will not know this. So their first thought would be our characters somehow got out of their cell and killed their colleague but no this doesn't happen and movie just finishes without answering it.Anyway bye hehe",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark

I first became interested in seeing it when I learned that Guillermo del Toro was involved because I like his films, although I was later disappointed to find that he wasn't really in charge of the movie. On the other hand, I was happy to find that André Øvredal, the guy who directed ""Trollhunter,"" was involved. I loved ""Trollhunter.""The film was interesting enough that I never looked at my watch during the film. (I know a movie is boring if I look at my watch.) It reminded me of ""It,"" but not as intense. It started out very well, like it was building to something special, but then it plateaued. More suspenseful than scary. Not a lot of monster time on screen. The way it ended made it seem like there would be a sequel.As an aside, I went on Discount Tuesday - $7 vs the usual $13 or $14 on other nights.

Flicking through the book, said main character flicks through the book and sees it writes itself stories which turn into real life events. The boy eventually gets impaled by a scarecrow named Harold and then becomes the scarecrow.. I mean, yaaaawn.I won't bore you with the rest of the events/deaths in the movie but they then do the typical 'research' into the book owner who was an inpatient at a psych hospital. They request medical records from 100+ years ago and end up breaking into the R. E. D room and magically find said record within seconds.. totally believable. They then listen to a recording of the owner being shocked and tortured during an interview.. yaaaaaawn!Don't bother watching.

360,Dar_Sargent,"Amateurish, lazy non-horror",2,5 March 2020,"This film follows a loose plot about some teens finding a cursed book that makes spooky things happen. The teens start to get picked off one by one, and eventually the 2 main characters manage to end the curse. It's a cookie-cutter plot with decent possibilities, but this lazy movie just doesn't give you anything interesting or clever.Besides the slightly quirky and goofy Austin Zajur as Chuck, I found all of the acting to be your usual teen fare, in other words, bad. The teens spend most of their time trying to show cheesy anxiety or just smiling like fashion models while delivering infodumps. Of course, this is largely the director's fault for getting such a schlocky performance from the young actors.Ultimately this movie is like cheesy old shows such as Are You Afraid of The Dark, Goosebumps, or made-for-TV family horrors like ""Tower of Terror,"" except this film has a teen focus along with modern tropes & cliches.And cliches are something it has in spades. Every single character is completely flat and 1-dimensional. I couldn't care about any of the main characters, despite spending a ton of time watching them just hang out. I especially hated how bland & generically cute the two leads are (the boy, Ramon, is supposed to be a tough drifter but looks like a rich, airbrushed metrosexual), and how they survive at the end for no reason other than being the central characters.
There's also a stuck-up girl who survives, presumably because if you're pretty, you're not allowed to die in this movie. (That's the level of braindead Hollywood cliches we're dealing with here.)Now for the BIGGEST PROBLEM of this film: The vast majority of the runtime is just these boring, shallow characters standing around and talking. Seriously, they just stand there, not doing anything interesting, and they just drone on and on and ON and ON. Was it too hard to write some interesting actions for them to do under the dialogue? Apparently. And all this does is waste your time, since the endless talking never makes you care about the loser characters or the paper-thin plot.Some people have praised the effects and creatures in this film, but I thought the CG looked incredibly dated and godawful. Many of the CG effects (especially spiders in one scene) look like something from fifteen years ago, which is just embarrassing. And obviously it ruins any scary impact those scenes might have. Besides the pale lady (who's honestly an extremely generic Tim Burton style rotund character), all the creatures in this movie were very boring to look at: you have a scarecrow and a couple zombie things.So if you want cool or scary visuals, you will be completely let down. And since the film drops the ball on that score, there's really nothing left to redeem it.Oh right, and the movie takes place in 1968. All this amounts to is some incompetently shoehorned references to Vietnam and Nixon. It feels like it was written by a twenty-something who didn't do any research on the '60s and instead just used the most obvious references he'd learned from pop culture.This is honestly one of the laziest movies I've seen in a long time. I give it 2 stars instead of 1 because it isn't outright offensively bad. But you should stay far away from this cheesefest.",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark
361,bwkolbuck,Pretty Good,7,14 September 2019,"This movie was pretty good.
I haven't seen any of Guillermo Del Toro's work, I heard he is really good at writing a good scary monster movie. I think this was a good film to introduce you to his work.GOOD THINGS
The CGI is pretty good no matter how ridiculous the monster is. For most of the movie the effects look real. It just starts looking a tad bit fake near the end of the movie Whenever the show the Jiggly Man too much. The acting is pretty solid for every character, the performances are at their weakest when they are doing something emotional, like crying. But whenever they have to be serious, funny, scream, or be horrified it's pretty good. The creative depictions of the monsters. This one speaks for itself..... just watch the trailer. The suspense is what kept me going. The way the suspense is shot, acted lit, choreographed, etc. is perfect, however, the suspense usually ends with a cheesy, bad, not scary jump-scare. But I'll get to that later. The 60s esthetic really adds an extra layer to the film. If it was set now in present day it wouldn't be as scary. The costuming, lighting and production design really create a good 1960s atmosphere.BAD THINGS
I mentioned this early: Jump Scares, they are just a lazy way of scaring people. I will admit, it did scare me 1 or 2 times, because of the suspense as mentioned early, but most of the time they don't work. I already said the emotional sappy acting isn't very good. This is probably my main complaint with the film. This movie builds off of the characters fears, but the problem is that these fears don't get developed enough for whenever a monster shows up to make sense. The scarecrow one and zit one and final one make sense but that's it. Often a character will say something like: ""I'm scared I might be next"" and then they're next. Or: ""That story scared me as a kid"" and then that story comes to life right after they say that.NITPICKS
When Stella's friends are telling Ramon that mother left her, it's stupid because her father talks about it 5-10 minuets later. I mentioned this earlier but in the third act sometimes the Jiggly Man looks fake. The monster in the red room scene is kinda funny to me.Overall this movie is pretty good and definitely something to write home about.",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark

366,nickrichardson-16919,POPCORN EMPIRE - Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark Review,8,6 September 2019,"""Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark cleverly adapts these stories into a cohesive whole, while also remaining faithful to the source material... 8/10""Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark is a classic, if controversial, children's book series written by Alvin Schwartz and illustrated by Stephen Gammell. The books are anthologies of short horror stories, known for their disturbing, highly stylized illustrations. The 2019 film, directed by André Øvredal (Trollhunter, The Autopsy of Jane Doe), attempts to connect the various stories within a singular narrative. This film took years of development and a handful of writers to put together a complex, layered screenplay. Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark cleverly adapts these stories into a cohesive whole, while also remaining faithful to the source material.WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD!The film uses an overarching plot to connect the short stories. The group of kids explain the legend of a young girl named Sarah Bellows, who was locked away by her corrupt family. While trapped in the basement of her house, she writes stories in a book with the supernatural ability to bring them to life, trapping whichever person she chooses in a waking nightmare.When the kids decide to break into the Bellows' old mansion, the main character Stella (Zoe Margaret Colletti) finds Sarah's book and awakens Sarah's spirit. After she they leave the mansion, The book appears to be writing itself, and everyone who entered the mansion begins disappearing one by one.Scary Stories plays into a lot of genre tropes without falling into horror's worst tendencies. Children in horror films can at times feel overwritten and obnoxious, but the leads in this film are likeable and feel like real people. They have a fun dynamic, and their back-and-forth banter brings a lot of laughs.What really sets this film apart is its beautifully crafted horror sequences. Each story is set up gradually, building the mythos behind each monster before it appears. The effects are extremely well crafted, and the photography is smooth and well framed, resulting in some chilling images. The prolonged silence builds the tension effectively before the sudden jolts, and the ""jump scares"" are much more effective because they're not overused. The creature designs are detailed and creepy, replicating the illustrations from the source material as closely as possible. The way the effects artists translated the illustrations into a 3D, live-action environment is a noteworthy feat, and it should definitely please fans of the books.The film's narrative is a story about stories, about how they form beliefs, and how these beliefs in turn shape reality. These themes connect between multiple characters, most notably Stella Nicholls and Sarah Bellows.Stella's mother left her and her father at a young age, and many people around her blamed her as she grew older. As a result, Stella blames herself for her mother leaving her family. As a parallel to this, Sarah Bellows did not murder anyone as the local legends said. Stella discovers that her family framed Sarah for the deaths they caused with mercury pollution. Eventually, Sarah became so full of rage and hatred that she became the monster her family had made her out to be. Stella realizes what has happened to Sarah as a result of the lies she was told, and this helps her to stop blaming herself for what happened between her mother and father. We also see that this revelation brings her closer to her father, as it is implied in the final scene that she told her father the truth about all of the disappearances that occurred, and he is now helping her find them.Scary Stories succeeds on multiple levels. It follows through with its themes, has solid character arcs, and delivers on fun sequences and scares. It's a great film for introducing younger audiences to horror, and should satisfy horror fans in general.8/10",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark

Since it's not just a single monster/entity killing everyone, you'll really surprised around the corners to see what comes next. The details and population crew are... shall we say, ""spared no expenses.""Would've been perfect, and could be, if you could only ignore the dents and scratches that pops up occasionally. The movie is quite the immersion, and you could really get into it, quite deep, only to be stopped by a brick wall. There are several scenes of the film that brings you back into reality when you noticed those minor, but obvious details. Just when the momentum gets going, you get halted by... poor acting(?).

I had low expectations about the theme with Halloween, some stereotype kids and an old, scary house with kind of an ancient grudge inside, but nevertheless I still was disappointed a bit. Nothing new, nothing to be frightened of to some extent ...Some average acting, some solid FX - but on the other hand: In all the darkness of night and that old house, there still was clear sight all the time, and e. g. the writing in that old and mystical book looked uniform like directly flowing out of my printer and not out of an evil ghost's bloody hand. I would have wished much more attention to detail! And I would have wished more realistic behaviour of characters several times, e. g. in that police station: Cop more or less motionless waiting for the monster to slaughter him after having pulverized his ammo ...

At first glance, this movie won my heart: the colour palette was vibrant and abysmal where every complexion would jump off the screen; environments and sets were seductive, shaping an immersive atmosphere to every scene; the lighting wasn't always natural but delicious in its deliverance to again, add to an atmosphere that was consistently present; the CGI was faultless, tallying to the already immaculate costume design of the monsters whom appeared to have slithered directly from the book they were based on. However, crawling under the skin were hindrances that tainted the overall viewing. The acting wasn't spectacular but rarely did it take from the experience; a main factor in its issue was the dialogue that occasionally felt offbeat. As well as this, character development was severely lacking especially in Michael Garzar's character whom was shallow and felt unnecessary to the plot to which also he felt forcefully injected into. In addition to story, it lacked depth which inherently could of been sacrificed for character development, sadly of which it wasn't. In all, considering a sequel is in development, perhaps this concept could of been better portrayed in a mini-series due to the episodic nature of its story; where characters could grow and arbitrary story elements implanted to move the narrative forward could be removed. But despite it's problems, character introductions were handled well where most inductions were quick and well placed and each character felt active outside of the plot regardless of its call for them as we were hastily thrown into their lives. Furthermore, the scares were beautiful, some being classic in their modern day 'loud noise' startles but others using pure discomfort to drive dread into the audience. Overall, this movie was fun and I would suggest it to any 'late 60's' horror fans that hunger for the nostalgic time trip such as myself.",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark

Yeah, that's what I'd say when I see a haunted book start writing in blood, ""How does it work?"".And of course, the worst offense in this horror movie, is that it's not even remotely scary.

The plot, while simplistic and done by other movies a dozen times, still was entertaining and made me curious to hear more, and there were occasional twists that left me surprised. Its a really good movie, and I'll get into why.The acting is mainly why I came to see this movie. I saw a small featurette on how the costumes were made and acted out, I saw the people put on the suits, I saw the CGI artists telling us that most of the actions were done by real people. This movie is VERY well made. My favorite character (no spoilers given) is someone who can crawl around on his back and twist 180 degrees, acted out by a man who can ACTUALLY do those things. Its obvious the directors put a lot of care into this movie, and I know they had fun with it. Even after seeing all the costumes and actors, I still was thoroughly creeped out by the final product.I myself am not a big fan of horror, and as such would literally never touch this movie again after having seen it through once, but I don't regret seeing it. Its probably very exciting for big fans of the book series, and I wouldn't be surprised if a sequel was on its way.Warning: This movie is NOT for children. I know the books were ages 8+, but those stories were written, not filmed. The graphics in this movie are too much for young kids if they were too much for even me. Ages teen and up is a better option for you. This movie, without spoiling, contains some very moderate violent gore/gore-like features, spiders, uncanny valley, MANY jump scares, and a few varied chase scenes.

""Harold"" scared the crap out of me! We all slept in the same room that night. So I was hoping the movie would hold up to the book. The special effects were excellent; followed the illustrations in the book. The movie involved one story line, so the stories were changed to some extent.

After the movie, when I went to try and make conversation about it, I forgot what I had just watched. The movie is good if you're looking for some really corny popcorn flick, and maybe have a few laughs. I was just disappointed, I guess I had expected too much from a film that at the time I didn't realize was PG-13, it was a Guillermo Del Toro film.
The same director who had directed Shape of Water (2017) which had won several nominations. Hellboy (2004), Pan's Labyrinth (2006), Hellboy: The Golden Army (2008), and Pacific Rim (2013)
So many great movies from such an amazingly unique director!
Even though I was disappointed for how easily forgettable the movie could be, it had very little CGI, only 10% of CGI was used for the monster's while the majority 90% was practical effects, so good job for the special effects team. That's the only compliment I can really give this film.",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark

This is a girl who saw The Conjuring first run at ten years old and has turned into a real horror buff.So, when I saw it was on Tubi, I figured ""Why not?"" So I did.It could almost be described as an anthology of horror stories centered around a central group of characters. It's tense, atmospheric and with no naughty bits and very light language, could serve as a great starting point for kids who want a little more scare than Scooby Doo has to offer.Fun and well written, the effects are adequate to good, not spoiling the world created by the director.For a long time horror fan, it's nothing you have seen before, but presented in a way that will bring smiles and a few chills. If your kids aren't nightmare prone, watch it with them, breed the next generation of twisted weirdies and as they grow older, you'll have more fun with some of the darker stuff. It will pay off. The only thing my daughter put in her high school bio about her family was that she liked to watch horror movies with dad. Yeah, I misted up a bit. Love that girl.",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark

Most of the audience this movie will garner will be from people who read these books when they were kids. Hardcore horror fans will PROBABLY not like it. You will not be scared except MAYBE with the jump scares.I'm sure kids will love it, just be mindful of the age your kids are and how they handle horror. This isn't like goosebumps. People who scare easily will like it too.They did a wonderful job getting the ""scary"" characters to look exactly how they were illustrated. In the books none of the stories are connected. Here, a main story was created to connect them. It's actually not that bad. It's scarier and less cheesy than what passes as children's horror but it's not like what adults expect. An in-between horror film with some good, CREEPY and FUNNY moments. Nevertheless, I enjoyed it but sheer childhood nostalgia drove me to go see it.",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark
404,dickchenny,Who is the film made for,5,2 September 2019,"The answer to the question brought up in the headline should be for fans of the original books that should be at least older then 16, then how come this movie is legitimately a disney channel orginal with very effective practical makeup, monsters and scares. The reason I did not give this movie a lower score is every scene with the stories in particular I found to be tense and sometimes grotesque in a very good way. The visuals and presentation of these scenes are stunning which makes me wonder why could they not have had a good story be the backing for the scares. The story is cut and dry lets go to a haunted house ooo here let me take this book and then oh no they come to life. The acting was passable for some characters but others are down right laughable (mainly the Tommy and Ruth) and the lead girl while pretty good in most scenes isn't the greatest at portraying emotion which is not good for the fact that she has a whole side plot that not her dad but her mother abandoned her as a child and she blames herself for this, now this is something we have seen a million times but I would not be harping on it if it weren't for the fact that it was totally useless in forwarding the plot and the scenes where it is used is I guess made for you to feel for the character but thats about it. Anyway I could not in good faith call this movie a trainwreck of any sorts and to be fair making unrelated short stories into a comparable film is not an easy task, this is a movie that when it wants to be can be very tense and very faithful to the book series, but I feel it would be much better suited for an anthology of shorts.",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark

414,CINEFILMSS,Interesting to watch but follows the basic Horror movie Storyline,6,14 July 2020,"The film is typical of a lot of Horror Movies being set in the 1970's Autumn time with the story taking place in a small American side town with a small population however this doesn't mean it isn't exciting and attention drawing to watch. The storyline, although very similar to that of IT:Chapter one (Mythical creature / ghost attacking children, with only children able to witness the attacks) does draw your attention, leaving you wanting to find out more.The film has the typical protagonists, gang of 'cool, hard nut wanna be' type then the nerdy, unpopular ones within that group one falls for the female, one has the typical religious family. The groups often face each other in a battle of power.The setting is typical for horrors, an abandoned, derelict house that has some weird haunted and magical thing about it. This makes the audience feel some sort of comfort while fearing what is unseen and what could lurk around each corner.
The connection between two of the subplots is interesting and put together in a interesting way, connecting two items you;d never expect to be involved in the main plot.Finally the storyline never has a dull moment, keeping you attention drawn to the screen rather then floating away on your phone or something. It is also nice to see a brave, female lead rather then the typical scared cat type roles.",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark

I loved the movie, I loved the way they ties the stories together, and I thought it was quality and well done. The visuals accurately reflect the books, which is resectable. My few complaints are that it would have been better with another 1-2 of the original stories included, or a little more complexity, and that the acting of a few could have certainly been better. We both enjoyed it, and my fiance' had never known the books.

Overall the books are still way more creepy than the movie. I liked that they used the song from the book (""dont ever laugh as a hearse goes by"").

What made the books so powerful was not just the stories but the artwork. I was excited to see such nightmarish artwork brought to life on the big screen. If you are as well prepare for disappointment. This film makes a pour attempt at being scary but remained boring throughout. The current trend now is to borrow from the popularity of Stranger Things or IT. You know where you have likeable preteens tackling supernatural forces with a little humor thrown in. This film tries the same thing but fails. The kids are unlikable and the acting is mediocre. The film also borrows atmospheric elements from Guillermo del Toro's masterpiece The Orphanage. From the trailer you already know that the short stories are told through one main over arching story. One very uninteresting one at that. You only get five of the stories and they are rewritten to fit this film which can be forgiven if done right. They were not. Without giving to much away I'm gonna stop here.So what did it get right? Atmosphere (although not original), visual effects, and that is all I could think of for the moment.What it got wrong, failed to capture the true creepiness of the books, borrowed heavily from other ideas (IT & Stranger Things), jump scares, unlikable characters, pour core story, and just boring.See it if you wish but don't go in hoping it does any justice to the books. Cause it won't.The books need to be told as a TV series with the best short stories are told as an episode. Through a window of time where character development excites you for things to come.

But Chucks sister is able to get out of the asylum due to longer being insane all because of Stella telling Rachels story.

Even from someone who didn't read the stories before watching this, I can tell the love this movie showed when trying to show this to the public.Sure, the characters aren't fantastic or anything, but they're fun and portrayed extraordinarily well by their actors and actresses, no matter which part! I've heard people compare this to Goosebumps, but - while I understand - I still think it's a good way to link the stories in one. It's based off a wide collection of scary stories!If you were to look at the illustrations of the stories and compare them with the movie, they'd look almost identical to each other, it's astounding how close they appear! However, my favorite thing about the movie is the idea of being trapped in destiny. I won't spoil the ending (honestly, I think the ending is kind of clever, in my opinion) but I will say the emotion the characters express when they realize they can't escape their inevitable doom is compelling, and really tries to get the viewer to try to figure out, how do you stop the stories from writing the characters?Speaking of, the way the characters blend with the original Scary Stories is nicely done.

Guillermo Del Toro still have that signature film looks on the movie, it feels like IT, Stranger Things or an adult version of the Goosebumps films ambiance. But they haven't gave the appeal that much. The weaving of the stories are great specially in the third act of the film and hinting us for more stories to tell. Scare moments are somehow predictable and music is not that frightening.
I think it will be better if they invested more on screen time on every part of stories and have better character arcs.

464,vcrbnt-89474,Forced Perspective,4,12 December 2019,"How can we ruin a delightfully spooky collection of yarns to frighten young and old? By constricting them in the coils of forced cohesion. This films largest sin is trying to contain the tales in a timeline.
Anthologies have been done before, many times over, in all media. This film could've take a page from their books. The usual setup up is a tale about the source material, a luridness of is it real or fiction from story to next, and a snap back to close the opener. This film tries very hard to create a fleshed out story about the SSTTITD, its origin, and incorporates a few of its works into the present (1968). I feel as though this ambition was too much for the source material. In a world of interconnected timelines and crossover events in our entertainment, SSTTITD is most successful in morsels that switch up the horror and fear via style to keep us on our toes (the book does this with one tale about body horror, the next tale is about the returning dead, etc). And that is the strength of the book, which unfortunately gets funneled a cookie-cut template of freeing trapped spirits.
Grievances with overall story structure aside, the execution of each tale is top notch fun and genuinely spooky. My favorite tale is Ramon's, a masterful exercise in balls to the wall dread. The special effects are almost all wonderful, aside from one tale that could've benefited from more practical applications. And the young actors are versed enough in displaying reasonable talent to convey true fear.
I personally found the overarching story to be clunky, forced, predictable and empty. Set in 1968, the film opens with all sorts of anti-Nixon propaganda, and this is peppered throughout the film, without resolution or reason. We have teenagers trick-or-treating, and jocks who look more akin to today's variant than anything from the late 60s. Each character is paperthin, with about as much development as a stick figure drawing.
At the end of the day, I find myself viewing this film as a scarier rip off of the Goosebumps movie, but more confined, and confused on its audience. The film is too scary for smaller kids, yet its tone and story are too undeveloped for any thinking adult or teenager. Sometimes a collection of campfire tales are best not interfering with one another, and that's what made the 80s anthologies so good. Each segment was it's own course, distinct and separate from the last and next. This film is an empty imitation of the far more memorable source, so at least there is that.",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark

None of the characters look or speak like they're from that time period, nor do the characters portrayed as living decades before seem like they were from the turn of the century. Could those involved in the making of this really not even bother to watch films from then to get an idea of how the cast should speak or have their hair styled?Also, for those of us who grew up on Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark, this movie barely touches on them. It references a few stories, but this should have just been its own thing since the books weren't justified here.

472,hawkkalitz,A 2019 Pre-October Adrenaline Rush OF FEAR!!!,8,15 August 2019,"If this were a Try Not to Cringe Challenge on this movie, I'd say chances are you could fail more times than not if you're new to the horror genre.First of all, how can anyone not like a movie that has Guillermo del Toro involved in it? I mean, I get it that he's had some terribly bad movies, but this one I felt was actually one of the most decent ones he's been involved in. It's pure tension and does have some creepy jumpscare scenes that makes it look like a horror movie.Most movies that are inspired by the book either have been a success or flopped miserably, but I feel like this, being based off a short children's book series, I'd say delivered to a degree, minus only a few deaths in the movie. Some horror movies go WAY overboard with the kills, but this one used minimal deaths, which I'd say is a breath of fresh air, and does make it suspenseful to watch. They kept it really tight for such a movie that takes its visuals so seriously, and especially if it does follow the book in terms of the monsters. I have NEVER heard of the books myself, but if someone were to start off on something horrifying, this could be a good place to begin.About this movie in general? Umm...not sure how to put it into words, but if I had to put it in a sentence. It's this...that I think I just have discovered the 6th level of hell...and pretty much got a big bowl of nightmares from it. The one takeaway in this movie (in which I got a big bowl of nightmares) was that ((SPOILER!)) R.E.D. Room scene. That monster pretty much was pure nightmare fuel and the way it grabbed Chuck by impregnating him into her was pretty much shock value. So yeah...thank you, Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark. You just gave me something that I'm marred over.Overall, I'd recommend this movie...but not if you're going alone and don't have the guts for horror movie jumpscares. Five Nights at Freddy's ain't got nothing on this movie!",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark
473,scifi-97852,Well...that was a movie.,2,4 November 2019,"I'm not one of those people who demand no one messes with my childhood memories. I know things are going to change because new generations have to experience them. I'm in my 30s, this movie isn't geared towards me, but hey, nostalgia plus teacher equals can I get kids to watch this and want to read more?Except... the movie is slow to start. The glue they tried to hold it together with wasn't necessarily bad, but it also wasn't coherent or cohesive. Making it set in the 60s seemed needless since the book was from the 80s. Even if you're going to go trip on the past, the 60s seems way too far back (quick note, Ramon could have been AWOL after being stop-lossed).Second, the stories aren't sacred, I get the need to tweak. But they didn't tweak. They stomped on them and ground out new ones. The greatest thing about these books is the fact there are so many stories. If one doesn't work, pick another. It's hard to tell kids to read a story that is nothing like what they just saw. And I really genuinely wanted to get a new generation of kids involved in these really awesome scary stories.Finally, the ending is abrupt and unfulfilling to say the least. It's never quite established why Sarah Billows had to be our main antagonist, beyond she had the book. If it's because they wanted to leave a sequel hook, it's a just not worth it. I started to, at one point, think Sarah had something to do with our main character's mom, but that went no where. Or maybe it did.I see a lot of people comparing it favourably to Goosebumps. And I loved Goosebumps too. But Scary Stories isn't Goosebumps. There was a bit of silliness, but sometimes downright seriousness and maturity to the stories (Maybe You'll Remember). And we missed that here. I was hoping to bring a new generation of kids to a book that made a huge impact on a lot of us.

484,jacksoc8,"Thanks, I hate it",1,21 May 2020,"This film shouldn't have happened. I mean that in both ways - like it should not have been produced and none of the events should have been able to take place. To get Sarah's book, two massive locks had to be picked. Luckily while running away from a high school sports caricature, the main characters randomly managed to find an accomplished lockpick! Oh wait, apparently the ""writer"" in the group can pick a lock with a switchblade on the first try! How convenient -_-The narrative is boring. I felt like I'd seen this before - not because I was familiar with the source material, but because they borrowed every trick from other cliche-driven drivel. The worst part is they had very original material to work with and decided to turn it into something it never was that resembles everything else...for a buck.The lead actress was terrible. I'm not sure if it was her under/overacting fits or her voice but I couldn't help but want her off the screen the whole time. Her friends were pretty bad too. Literally everything was bad.This is all supremely disappointing as a fan of the source material, the horror genre, and someone who enjoyed The Autopsy of Jane Doe and Troll Hunter. The most impressive thing about this film is how they managed to ruin almost every aspect. It was never even creepy and it all felt regurgitated.And the montage of the happy remaining characters at the end might be one of the stupidest things I've ever seen. Ramon and I don't even remember her name were last seen in cells next to a now-deceased police chief or whatever. You know, the one the girl lifted keys off of? And then Ramon stole and crashed his car?So even if the me lookey a loose limb man stopped chasing Ramon, I'm pretty sure both of them would have been arrested and jailed. And then the girl is walking through her high school getting nods of approval for what - writing Sarah's story? Literally no one cared except them and no one believed them at all?

I did find myself uninterested in the story overall, but some of the scares were very satisfying.I will say the trailers and promos totally took the ""whoa"" factor out of many scenes though.

501,shaunnatoots,Disappointing,1,6 September 2020,"Believe me when I say that this film does not do the books justice. This film should have been portrayed as an anthology, meaning that they should have taken 4 or 5 of the original stories, made them each into a segment, and then put it all together. But boy was this film bad, as it entirely missed the point of the original books. This film got it all wrong. Excellent cinematography and clever death scenes won't spare you from negative criticism, as it is all I have for this film. The acting is as stale as a 37 year old loaf of bread that was made with concrete. The dialogue, story, and acting get more and more cringeworthy as the film progresses, most notably the line about the toe in the stew, which comes out as bland as it could have possibly been. This film has some of the lamest lines and execution I have seen in years. It's unbelievable. Like other reviewers have previously noted, all the adults in this film are total Chads and Karens. The writing was incredibly cliche, particularly in the hospital scene, where the dialogue and acting are abominably terrible. Sometimes a film is so bad that it makes you laugh, but this is one of those films that is just so bad it makes you cringe. Right from the opening of this film I lost all hope for it. Production companies and filmmakers better keep this advice in mind. When you're making a film about books that contain many different stories, portray it as an anthology. Don't try to write a completely new story and ruin everything. But hey, at least the schraderbräu guy made an appearance.",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark
502,luyandojoestar,A solid film,6,6 November 2021,"I'm going to start off saying that this movie is in no way scary, I'd say it's more comedic than anything. The story line is simple and doesn't take itself to seriously, and the characters are nicely written and interact well together in the story. The ""scary"" scenes were very abysmal and replicate Disney channel Halloween specials, however they were watchable and didn't completely ruin the movie.",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark
503,jtyn-30813,"Atrocious Adaptation, Goosebumps was Better",3,23 August 2020,"Unlikable characters, little progression in character development or story, weak plot device. Not even remotely scary, but sometimes it was disgusting.Every thing in this film is tied together, and it is really disheartening that it was not an anthology. (Different stories, different people, different setting.) The film takes place in the 60s, and we have basically four characters to follow. Sadly, they are boring and have no personality, even teens who specialize in watching trash horror movies would be disinterested. There were about two stories that were well-done and decent, but that's about it. The story gets insanely cliche when they introduce the crazy old Black lady that knows about lady-who-was-thought-to-be-dead-and-murdered-her-whole-family whose now in a psychiatric hospital, and only she knows how to stop the supernatural events.Somebody needs to redo this book series again. Set the time to a modern setting and not some racist small town in the 60s. (Or atleast set it in the 80s.) Use a 'campfire' narrative format to introduce more settings and characters that we follow through. (Use it as a reference to ""Are You Afraid of the Dark"")I am disappointed in everyone involved in the making of this film. I am a huge fan of the director and the writers but this is terrible. This film is a hard pass. I only watched it because the books were a huge part of my childhood. And they absolutely abolished my childhood nostalgia and treasured memories. Why was there even a main plot? Just tell the stories, you cheese-eating clowns. I hope your pillows on the other side are already warm, and not pleasantly cold.There is virtually no audience for this film. Kids would be confused on how the plot plays out. It is borderline rated R but not remotely interesting for adults. Unecessarily racist, that's probably why they chose the 60s- just to be racist. (The whole book series was released in the 80s and 90s or why didn't they just set the time in the 80s or 90s?) Pretentious colour scheme and cinematography but the lighting was wrong. It wasn't atmospheric, it was lukewarm. The scenary in this movie was flat and bland, it made me feel like a farmer even outside the cornfield shots. Annabelle's prequel was even better.

I definitely could tell they were inspired by IT and Stranger Things for a time piece, and can't ignore the fact that Goosebumps did the whole ""Bring The Story To Life"" bit recently (although it wasn't the first). I feel like Me Tie Dough-ty Walker was probably the best monster, with Harold coming in close second. I think they did a pretty good job with bringing Gammell's awesome illustrations to life. The twist on Harold was actually better than the original story, in my opinion (it is one of my favorites). The Toe scene fell a bit weak for me and I wish they'd used another story in its place.I really would have liked to have seen The Drum, The Girl Who Stood on a Grave, and The Wolf Girl, to make a few favorites.

510,charelle-vde,Everything IT and Stranger Things aspire to.,8,24 January 2020,"The best thing about this movie, in my opinion is the pacing. So many horror movies feel like the third act goes on to long. Scary Stories succeeds in building tension consistently, without falling into the trap of having so much tension for so long that it's impact wears off. The movie is just long, and just short enough. (I know this may seem trivial but as a person who often struggles to remain excited after minute 55, this is high praise).The environment and atmosphere created is excellent and authentic. The sets, costumes and writing are beautifully reminiscent of the time. The persistent hints to Nixon and The Vietnam War, offer great current political commentary, but only if you're willing to engage with it.The acting from such a young cast was not stellar but honestly offers nothing to complain about either. I would have liked some more screen time for some minor characters. It feels like the first victim was better known to us than Chucks sister... You know... What's her face. The characters are likable and relatable, and yet perfect character studies of the stereotypes they embody.The digital as well as practical effects are very well done, and the design work on the ""villains"" is incredible. Each has distinct characteristics and a story is told through their appearance. Also they manage to be truly scary without an over use of gore and violence. In fact the movie contains very little actual violence, which is quite refreshing.As for the thrill ride if it all... Beautiful use of jump scares. Not over used, nor understand utilized. Combine this with the consistent build in tension and it is near perfect.Where do I fault it you ask? It definitely felt like an anthology. Thread holding each individual ""scary story"" to the next is the weakest part of the film.The overarching narrative of ""bullied outsider turns vengeful"" didn't spark anything for me. But maybe that's just me being bored by the fact that everything needs a motivation. Sometimes a monster is a monster and that's alright.Easy viewing. Main stream appeal. Might recommend to younger horror fans, or older relatives who don't want to be too spooked.",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark

540,Jaded_Raconteur,"Interesting Concept, but Not Scary",6,17 August 2019,"I should preface my review by pointing out that I have been watching horror movies for a long time, so perhaps I'm a little jaded in my comments.That said, I found the idea behind the film to be initially a fun and interesting one, bringing to mind films like Cabin in the Woods and American Werewolf in London. The touches of humour were carefully crafted into the film and worked well without feeling tacked-on or forced.However, there was a lot of potential here that I feel was wasted in the way the film relied on stale and static tropes and overused archetypes for development - the predictability of the film was such that it became underwhelming overall (and not scary in the least). Three people actually walked out of the film half-way through, and while the film certainly wasn't going to rewrite the horror movie genre, I don't think it was that bad.There was also a lack of real character development (though the foundations were there, particularly for Stella, Charlie, and August, but not so much for Ramon, and I wondered what Stella's father and Sheriff Turner were really supposed to add - it would be interesting to see what was left on the cutting room floor). Again, over-reliance on static archetypes undermined this element of the film, particularly as nothing was done to reconstruct them (a la Cabin in the Woods) or really develop them into characters you liked and didn't want to die. Perhaps this was because they tried to jam in too many ""stories"", which took away time to develop other elements, including the ""horror"" factor.If you're a horror movie buff, I'd suggest waiting for a release to a streaming service if you want to see it.",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark

542,mickeythechamp,"Good ideas, messy execution",7,9 June 2020,"Skip to the ending of this review for my overall thoughts.So let´s address one big elephant in the room. This movie is clearly capitalizing on the young adult, 80s vibe a lot of reason horror movies have used as of 2019, such as It and Strangers things. This is not a critique of using that vibe, but a waring for you that you might find this movie a bit unoriginal or even overdone. I personally don´t mind it, since I think a setting and vibe can create some familiarity that allow the viewer to skip a lot of set-up and go strait to action, but again you might disagree and therefore find the movie tiresome.Let me praise this movie for what it did great. I am glad this movie did not go for an R rating. This young adult horror fantasy reminds me of Goosebumps and of course the source material Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark. I will be honest and say I have not read any of the books this movie is based on but know of them and of course know about its famous artwork. The lower age rating makes it harder for the creators to make scary scenes, since they can´t just throw blood everywhere and call it a day. Creative solutions and amazing suspense are what is driving this movie, and it is masterfully done. All the designs of the different monsters are well done and scary. Only a few did not make me scared but overall, the monsters and horror are done beautifully. While you could argue this is a poor adaptation of the books, I would argue it is used recontextualized to make it a whole story, instead of just a few short stories after each other.This is still an analogy horror movie in the sense, that it is not centered around a single monster. Every character is haunted by the scary stories they heard as a kid, and therefore get there very own monster. This is very similar to how Pennywise from It works.But let´s talk about why my rating is not up in the clouds, but just past mediocre. The movie follows a group of young adults who must stop the scary stories to be written in a haunted book. While this is going on the movie introduce two plot threads that are not important for the movie and is only there for filler. While the kids run around and gets killed by monsters, the Vietnam War is going on. So is the election with Nixon. At the same time, the main characters mother is constantly brought up because she left the family. These two plot threads feel extremely forced, since you do not see them coming and you do not know what the payoff is going to be. The answer is there is no payoff. It is patting and nothing else. A quick remark to that. I think the ending of this movie, which I am not going to spoil, is nothing but sequel bait. All the unanswered questions and plotlines was clearly meant for a sequel. While there is nothing necessarily wrong with that I as a viewer felt unimmersed and none caring for most of the plot threads. The movie simply does a poor job of making you care for some of its emotional parts and it is a big letdown for me.Also, the final confrontation in this film seems out of place. It seems like it belongs to a whole other genre and movie.So overall, the horror in this movie well done, but it uses overdone tropes, the characters are great but written with extra plot lines that are not done well and the ending is a letdown. I would recommend watching it though. Maybe you are going to like some of the elements I did not and enjoy it more.

Which it is, and yet it is around the 2 hour mark which is long for a movie in this day.The first scarecrow monster was done very quickly yet was still the scariest of them all in my opinion. Which is saying something.The rest of the monsters were disappointing. If you can even call them monsters.

551,Waleed-Iqbal,"Hits right spots, at slightly wrong times. Monsters steal the show.",6,14 August 2019,"Things I liked:
The environment and setting of storylines are nicely wrapped and movie tries its best for providing closures while hitting towards a possible sequel to connect the remaining dots. The direction was pretty good and editing was equally good if not better. Performances were believable but not the best thing about the movie. THE MONSTERS WERE TERRIFICThings I disliked:
The tried and tested jumpscares. Camera cuts were totally predictable and sometimes too much to actually happen that you start getting annoyed. Running and chasing were giving too much where they could have been cut half in length. The sound mixing could have been made better by giving dialogue more decibels than the surrounding as they were hard to understand sometimes and felt the need of subtitles.P.S.

552,ollie1337,Just not a good horror film,4,21 August 2019,"I totally understand that this is an adaptation of classic stories and that there are certain elements that needs to excist to stay true to the original plot. However - just watching this as a person who never read about the stories before - it just isn't that good.As a horror film it's laughable, the monsters are not scary, and the ones that have potential to be scary just ends up feeling off and comical. The only time during this movie I felt any sort of ""ohh that's creepy"" was when Chuck saw the old lady with the dog just sitting still and then looking towards him in the closet scene (the jumpscare after ruined it tho).Otherwise they depended way too much on super high and sudden noises along with cheap jumpscares.
It was annoying that some of the monsters they could outrun, meanwhile some could teleport their way to them however they liked.The trailer made it look really thrilling but in the end I walked out of the cinema disappointed.
I'm probably missing some ""oh but they did that to honor the original""-point, but out of a subjective standpoint this isn't a good horror film.",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark

The leading actress seems pretty good to me, the rest of the cast is decent.
spoiler:
I like the first two monsters quite a bit, also their stories, especially the story of the scarecrow, the story is simple, a ghost has the power to write stories in a book that cannot be erased and it doesn't matter if you tear off the page, the story It is still being written, that story comes true and each one ends with the typical group of teenagers one by one. She creates everything and appears in the background in the monster attack scenes. That bothers me about the film, they create a big problem but the solution is very simple, anyone could do it, you just have to write the true story of the ghost that was defamed as a child killer. In addition the ghost is very badly done and does not convince me, the end trying to open a second does not seem reasonable either. The subplot of her as a writer seems to me to spare, I could try to write stories in the book to counteract power, it is useless and unused.Enviar comentarios",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark
561,rohiethnp,This movie really bothered me (in a bad way),2,14 August 2019,"MAJOR SPOILERSSo, the movie starts out with the main characters, randomly getting into a car of a stranger (who happens to be alone and someone from their own age group), hiding from the one character we should feel no symphathy for in the movie (more on this later). Where they later on, plan to go to a haunted house.So, in this haunted house, that stores a old myth, they find a secret compartment where there lies a book full of scary stories, and when someone asks Sarah Bellows -the girl who tragically died in that room- to tell them a story, that person dies.So, Stella, egoïstic and stupid as she is, does this, unbeknownst to her friends. Here is where the movie really, really started to bother me and started to really don't make any sense:So, the positive things I took from this movie is the acting (Stella is good in her role), the horror elements (the main premise and some of the tension is great) and the pacing (movie never really gets dull).Now the negatives:So, Sarah is the one who started this all, so why do all of her friends have to suffer and die? I do not understand this.
Even the bully who really hadn't done anything dies, why? Because he is a bully and gets what he deserves? That doesn't make any sense.
What about Chucks sister? She wasn't part of it all, but she had to be traumatized and put into a mental hospital, all because Stella made a egoistical choice that her friends had nothing to do with?What also doesn't make any sense is, that the book writes (funny eh, that I don't find a self writing book strange?), only when the plot demands it.
The book knows what the characters are going to do, because the book reads you.
So, when it's the sister's turn, the book knows that Ruth is going to the bathroom. But when it's the turn of Ramon (the lonely guy in the random car and Stella's love interest), the monster just stalks him?There is also a cop (who also like the bully we should feel no symphaty for) who gets murdered, but the authorities never questions this?
Can he come back to life just like you want to bring back your friends, Stella?Alas, this is just a standard horror movie, with really no clever choices or twists. Really sad, because the premise is great.",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark

581,BWeManX1026,A Solid 5/10 (Many Spoilers Ahead),5,15 August 2019,"Honestly for a kids horror movie it's pretty solid. It was scarier than I expected and I think the plot worked well! It tied together spooky short stories into a more cohesive global narrative. The rather limited gore was well utilized and scary enough while definitely not being a slasher. The use of lighting and suspense was very strong.---Anyways, why I can't go higher than a 5 (mad spoilers) ---My personal gripes:I get that it's PG-13 and they're trying to cover a lot of narrative ground in a short run-time...but there were just some things that I just couldn't get over. If some of the monsters were going to be so goofy, I wish that they wouldn't have bothered showing them. They could have at least done more practical effects like Harold (thumbs up). I laughed out loud at the awkward CGI head with the ridiculous voice and the...happy marshmallow lady?It kind of irks me that Stella stole the damn book in the first place and got all her friends killed, and she gets off scott free? Those poor other kids didn't even do anything XDI don't think it's ever explicitly stated but I think the kids are supposed to be like 15, and Ramone is a draft dodger which puts him firmly 18+ and it's like...why are you hanging out with these children? The potential romance is kind of the scariest thing in the movie.Plot hole that kind of ruined the last half hour of the movie for me: They were booked and in jail for the night. The officer tasked with guarding them is dead on the ground with his keys stolen and they escaped the jail. Ramone's fingerprints are all over his stolen police cruiser that he totally fled jail with and then wrecked.......and that's just never mentioned again?

590,AndyDextrousUK,A New Spin On The IT Crowd?,5,2 September 2019,"If there's one obvious thing to say about SSTTITD then it does what it says on the tin, well that is if you were to remove the Scary. On the other hand it's hardly a cauldron of silly, uber-black comedy dross either. In fact it's quite stylish, almost in a 'if Tim Burton did something sensible or realistic', kind of way.There are some films that leave an impact or memory even, but unfortunately this one really fails to hit either for me. It's hard to pin down exactly what is wrong with it and I wouldn't necessarily say it's children's horror, well, children of the 80's maybe who are now past the ripe old age of 21, myself included.In fact in this department it's very much in the IT part 1 school of thought featuring a bunch of teenagers who find grim reality behind the myth of the old Bellows House during a Hallowe'en visit, only it's nowhere near as polished.I admit these weren't the kind of stories I was brought up with in the 80's at all and I can't knock a slightly creative leaning to them which I found intriguing. The Shining, Salem's Lot, Jack the Ripper, IT, the Changeling and Misery were more in line with my own personal taste and digestion of the time.It's essentially all about monsters and I think personally the film would have been better had some more context (or text) been added to each of the stories. Actually though this could be a clever ploy on the part of those involved in the making, as the pages of the book are in part on show, just perhaps not long enough to read thoroughly - either that or it could be that I fell asleep through part of the film. So, this may require more than one viewing to get the full context of each.Considering the theme of more than 1, albeit connected story the film does have some sluggish moments including the build-up but overall this film seems more of a showcase of special effects and, apart from one character they are not too bad at all. Above all some of them are quite believable and not completely bonkers CGI, like Mama for example.I admit that I enjoyed the first half more than the second but overall it just didn't pull off any scares that I was hoping for and I left the cinema feeling a bit numb as a result. (It was however gone midnight and a tad chilly!)Looking at some other films this year in a similar vein, a jolly decent scare seems to be becoming a bit of a lost art form (The Curse Of La Llorona excluded which I thoroughly enjoyed and which will be a blu ray purchase).I can't give this more than 5, because in my honest opinion it is average and nothing more which is a shame as it had potential. Would I let any of my kids under the age of 15 watch it? - Absolutely no chance because it is in parts grotesque - although it hardly surprises me, like the games world these days it could be deemed second nature to feel at home showing this to your toddler.Hopefully IT Part II can pull it out of the bag instead!",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark

594,rustedman,Great visuals wrapped in an shockingly uninspired central plot. .,4,13 October 2019,"I truly have no idea why Hollywood does this.
Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark isn't a ""mystery"".
It's a wonderful collection of short stories with fantastic illustrations that excite and repulse in equal measure. They are simple, almost a cross between a Grimm Fairy Tale and the wonderfully macabre distress of a Cronenbergian nightmare.When I first head that Guillermo Del Toro was attached to this way back when, I was thoroughly excited. I believe early reports had him directing as well.
I am also on board with the director responsible. I loved Troll Hunter.But it was when I saw that first trailer, and saw the rating. This is not intended to be a faithful recreation of the book. This is an amalgamation that goes by ""feel"" and little else.This needed to have a harder edge. It needed an R rating. It needed to be soaked in atmosphere, the viewer dreading every scene. It needed that uneasiness that permeated each page of the books.Unfortunately, a producer must have seen the newest GooseBumps with Jack Black and things changed. Tone changed.I am not asking for buckets of blood and gore. But these books, while sold as books for children, were not in the least, intended for them. I grew up with these books, and have read them dozens of times. They amazing in how short they are, but so effective in achieving actual chills in record time.But now, we have the movie.
I have no complaints towards the acting, or editing, or general design. The ""monsters"" were (for the most part) incredible. They were exactly as they should be. This is one of the most important aspects for a film adaptation to get right, and they nailed it.It's the story. It's the plot. It's combining so many of these stand-alone tales into one dour narrative that is absolutely unforgiving in it's laziness.This movie needed to be more like ""Trick R Treat"" than Goosebumps. It needed an edge.The resulting film, as it stands, wasn't bad. It's wasn't good.I would of loved to have seen these stories represented in hour long episodes on Netflix. This needed to be a series, not a microwave-version of the ""greatest hits"" wrapped around an uninspired plotline that veers off into it's own ""thing"" for no good reason whatsoever.Watch it for the practical effects and then read the books and imagine what could have been.",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark

607,moviesnbooze,Almost Completely Irredeemable,3,31 August 2019,"What begins to seem like it'll be a charming, yet effective, horror film soon reveals itself to be nothing short of the average bi-monthly scary movie for teens with virtually no substance or anything creative to bring to the table.Admittedly, the first few scenes actually manage to be quite charming. Giving off the same tone as the recent It film, the characters, consisting of kids around high-school age, really do feel as if they have a genuine relationship. The writing and dialogue paint the perfect picture of setting up a group of kids with a bond against the bad guys. Unfortunately, the character writing falls off after the first act and quickly loses any redeemable quality it had.There is one creative segment/story involving body horror that managed to spark interest in me but came way too late in the film to save it.The entire plot feels like an ad lib adapted from ""scary movie"" script template as it's just as cliché and predictable as you'd expect a PG-13 horror to be. Everything ranging from love interests, family dynamics, and structure failed to surprise me at all.The scares are about as impressive and effective as your niece jumping from behind a wall and yelling ""BOO!"" Predictable and dispassionate, it wouldn't surprise me at all if the scares were made up on the spot due to the filmmakers' laziness.The third act is nothing short of embarrassing. It fails to fulfill any potential it had at being interesting, tense, or scary. And after the climax settles, the attempt at setting up a sequel is so heavy-handed that it gives its audience one of the worst send-offs of the year.While I had, maybe unreasonably, above-average expectations due to Guillermo del Toro's producer/screenwriter credit, Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark fails to be anything an American audience hasn't seen before.",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark

The story by itself is catching and entertaining. Guaranteed to give you the chills throughout the hole screening and get a hell of a scare every now and then. The make up and scenery is just on point, and it for sure will make Easter egg fans happy.
What's more, the movie gives a message that perfectly suits present time's problematics. Racism, discrimination, political issues and pollution are just some examples seen in the film. It reminds us of the real evils, sometimes greater than the actual paranormal ones.

615,speermaryp,Great Movie,9,6 April 2020,"As a kid I used to read Scary Stories To Tell in the Dark and loved those books. To see that they made a movie based on those books was awesome and I was excited to see the movie. I love horror movies but I am very critical of them because a lot of them are very unrealistic in the way characters act or other things that happen (that isn't supernatural).
This movie was awesome. The acting and relationship between the characters was, in my opinion, amazing. To me, it all made sense and the flow was perfect. There wasn't anything that didn't make sense in the story line and it was easy to follow. As far as the supernatural aspect of it, I thought it was really good, too. The only issue I had with it was I do believe the graphics could be better. In this day and age, I don't feel like there is any reason not to have amazing graphics. Besides that, I loved the stories they told and how they made the story.
The original books were simply just story after story, the movie really connected them in a way that was original, interesting, and made sense.
So often people make movies based on books that doesn't follow anything about the book which is disappointing to all of us. This was not the case with this movie.
I believe this movie was done really well and I would definitely recommend it.",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark

But this...this is just a slap in the face to an incredible classic.The original Scary Stories book series was creepy...truly something that would haunt the corners of your mind as you fall asleep at night. Pair those chilling stories with the meticulous and haunting drawings and Scary Stories is something that needs to be locked away in a time capsule so that one day aliens can understand our brilliance.This film however...where to begin? I gave it a 3 just to give proper credit to the Scary Stories original creations because as you're watching, the only decent moments you'll see are the exact scary stories from the book-- creatures and all. Minus the Jangly man. Of which we get very little explanation why or what his purpose is.The through line boiler plate story of these children finding the book in the ""old haunted house down the way"" could be overlooked if only one scrap of originality came through. The children are completely unlikeable and basic. The main ghost who haunts has one of the most generic back stories ever. Her family shut her away because she was albino? And they were poisoning the well so they blamed the daughter?I'll wrap up this rant but the end (SPOILER AHEAD) -- after decades of evil doing, this albino storytelling ghost is completely convinced to change her ways because of one, ONE basic monologue from the tear-filled girl....EYE ROLL + YAWN.Good night.

621,tyler-17538,"Scary for kids, entertaining for adults!",7,16 April 2020,"For a movie based off of a children's ""horror"" book series, Scary Stories To Tell In the Dark is surprisingly more scary than the books were (unless you count those grotesque illustrations. I still have nightmares from some of those) but not by much. This is actually not a bad thing since it makes it more like the source material since both the books and the movie are fun for both kids and adults alike. If you are a young teen or a kid you will most likely find this movie scary enough to make you think twice before turning your lights off in your house but not scary enough to make it inappropriate for a kid to watch. If you are an adult, well to be honest you most likely won't get scared by most of the monsters and set pieces through out the movie, but the movie still is incredibly entertaining to watch (albeit a bit cheesy at times) and still has some parts that will leave even adults looking over their shoulder.The movie follows an overarching story rather than jumping from short story to the next and while the plot itself may not be scary, a few characters were definitely creepy and disturbing.One of the biggest highlights for this movie is the new character named ""The Jangly Man"" which is actually a character composed of various aspects from several stories within the books. The Jangly Man's grotesque and unnatural movements will make your skin crawl and the way it is introduced will make anyone feel uneasy at the sight of the creature, making this character the scary highlight of the movie. The credit for making this character so scary mostly goes to Troy James, a actor/contortionist who was able to act out the unnatural movements of the character flawlessly without the need for digital FX. This character is also the only character that actually shows any real gore but it still isn't enough to make the movie rated R. I am a 23 year old who has honestly been desensitized to most scary movies so the fact that this character was able to make me feel so uneasy really says something about the quality of the character.This movie does a good job at being entertaining and simultaneously unsettling to watch for both kids and adults unlike most movies from the horror genre which if that doesn't deserve some credit then I don't know what does.",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark

Ovredal/Del Toro excel at giving us chillingly well constructed tension filled scenes of ominous creatures, haunting spirits, and just an atmospheric overall feel that puts the viewer right into the stories. While the teen characters are by the numbers and wreak of goosebumps/IT/Stranger Things influence, they are serviceable for the particular story. The horror visuals take the main focus and steal the show for the 108min runtime which is actually longer than most horror's of this nature and build off scene to scene effectively. Even viewers that are unfamiliar with the classic stories of the same name will be very satisfied with this film and hopefully be inspired to go back and read the books.

I used to pray for Halloween to roll around because we would have a reader come to my school and read us 1 story a day WITH the creepy audio from the tape deck. Those days were Epic! Sadly this movie was huge let down for me as a fan. I was so excited about the Harold scene and it was, meh. The spider scene was cringy, but the Jangly Man original and gave me the chills, but the story as a whole was just boring and uneventful for me especially with political inserts at random points of the film (even though this is not a time piece) it just didn't flow well. I think Netflix should pick this up and make it a show for Halloween like they did the new Sabrina comics and the Haunting of Hill House. As a show it would translate better with audiences that grew up with these stories and would open it up for a different rating... (something above pg13 for some episodes) and individual stories.

I'm aware that this movie is PG 13, though, but I feel like they should've bumped up the rating a bit so they could make it scarier. Mostly all of the scary parts were jump scares that seemed like fillers to me. And some of the monsters were so random to me. Overall, the story line and twist at the end were okay, but it could've been much scarier if they made it for older audiences, like I said earlier.

To me, it is inferior to them with the first one having a score of 7/10 for the second one 6/10. 7 because it was actually scary and it has had a nice theme song. My wife would have rather IT much higher and hated It follows. There was some level on tension in It follows, which is not present here. The weakest part was the ending, the movie's strong suits are CGI effects (though the monsters are not scary) which is also a strong suit in ""IT 2"", and Stella, a really likeable character. I did care about her and didn't want her to be hurt. It is an enjoyable flick with an original story that doesn't keep the same level of narrative at the end.

exactly what kind of trauma I'm talking about. The monsters were a metaphor for small town
racism all along. It was terrifying. The only thing that would have made this a feel-good movie would have been a bulldozer knocking over the town and setting up a strip mall.This movie brought exactly what we always needed old outdated scary stories to be. Finally, a film rife with sassy political satire that punches up. Truly one of a kind these days. I mean, ty dough walker representing ICE who ramone most over come his fear of was truly a masterful feat of symbolism boardering on the avant-garde.Remember being a kid and having zero inner monologue? Just blurting out everything that came to mind? This movie brought me back to simpler times despite the hyper realist toxic cinema dudebros nitpickinckly screaming at the clouds that kids didn't talk like this in the 60's. Does it even matter? The 60's were a more toxic mess than my twitter replies from frog avi's.
I found myself sore of mouth and agape at the references I knew were coming. I had to be physically removed from the theater by 16 year olds making minimum wage for continuously shouting ""I REMEMBER THAT"". The main character was such an empowered three dimensional realistic female. unfortunately this movie didn't pass the bechdel test where female characters are supposed to talk to each other for more than 5 minutes or something.The best part about this movie was not only its progressive spin on an old outdated set of
stories but the fact that it was so absorbing I completely forgot I was watching a movie. It was like ""wow I've known these characters my entire life. They are sooo me and my friends."" Also The cop was such a nuanced character explaining how the subtle undertones of racism
work in the real world.The interactions and dialogue is so realistic despite the fact that I felt like it was a real slow burn and was loaded up with too much filler. I felt like it took forever to get from scene to scene. But OMG the hospital workers were the bad guys all along? I probably should have seen this coming because they've built up on them having sinister motivations a little too much...My only other real complaints are the dad's toxic masculinity being so unbearable. I didn't like that the film suggested the mother should have stayed. It felt really sexist.
I felt they tried too hard to make the characters not seem so one-dimensional. They could have been a little more one-dimensional and easier for me to wrap my head around.Other than that. MASTERPIECE",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark
642,Kronos_,I don't think a 10 year old would find this scary.,4,16 March 2021,"If you're looking for an honest and quick review: Don't watch this movie if you're looking for an actual scary movie. If you're looking to watch a movie with a subpar plot, and pretty interesting visuals, give it a shot. For a more in depth SPOILER FREE review, read more below.I don't mind the direction they went with the plot. With the original stories being short stories, it's understandable they needed to find a way to blend all of these shorts together. However, the way it unfolds leaves much to be desired.The main cast is pretty good at acting. Of course there's the occasional cheesy lines and the standard tropes, (weird/nerdy girl with glasses, goofy dumb friend, the jock, the loner, etc.) however I put the blame on the writers.What threw me off from the get go was how they cut this film together. The first 15-20 minutes or so are so face-paced I almost had to stop and check my movie wasn't randomly skipping ahead every 5 seconds. They try very hard to throw together some type of relationship/backstory exposé with the main characters and some of the supporting characters, that I ultimately think it could have been removed altogether. If you watch this film, or have already seen it, I'm sure you understand what I mean.I think the most disappointing part to me was the lack of focus on the short stories altogether. Only one out of the six or so stories that were featured lasted longer than 5 minutes. If you haven't read any of the original material this film is based off of, I highly recommend checking out google images. You can see how absolutely unsettling some of the illustrations are for these stories. The film really dropped the ball on trying to elicit the emotions you would feel after looking at those illustrations.The only redeeming quality of this film was the monsters themselves (minus the monster at the end, he was cool but they relied A LOT on CGI). They had a great idea to make them primarily with practical effects. If only they were utilized for longer than a few minutes. The trailers really tried to make it seem like this film would be much scarier than what it actually was. A lot of the ""scares"" were predictable jump scares instead of trying to use a scary atmosphere to build tension.All in all, I'm really disappointed with how they handled this IP, it really could have been so much more than what it was. Anyone rating this movie higher than a 5/10 was either looking through ""Nostalgia Glasses"" because they read the books as a kid, or they have never seen a good horror movie.If you want a good Halloween-esque movie to watch that ties short stories together, I HIGHLY recommend watching Trick 'r' Treat. It's gotten fairly popular since its release back in 2007, but I still find many people haven't seen it. I don't want to give any details on that film, but I will say: Ever since watching Trick 'r' Treat, I've watched it every year since around Halloween.",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark

But, as a grumpy, older cynic, I'd say it was entertaining at best, and predictable for the most part.What would have made this movie better? An R rating. I never felt like the kids were in real danger and most of the ""deaths"" are just ""disappearances"" Accept for maybe the first victim with Harold the Scarecrow.

The script works as a deus ex machina so the plot can move forward even hinting to a potetional sequel.
All though storywise is a poor film its visuals make it watchable enough to sit in a movie theater wondering if it truly was worth your time or not.

If you are truly a fan of series,you will love it. Other wise, like me a neutral fan, will feel like director shot a dud torpedo towards audience.
Me and my friends even thought this was like a cash grab attempt for the current stranger things season 3 hype or upcoming IT movie. Some audience members were a bit confused with the ending.

666,kierangriffiths-61754,Waist of time...,2,6 October 2019,"Predictable and cliche.
I was bored 90% of the time and never felt scared or shocked or tense, the film uses outdated and sloppy tropes and acting with a corny script and pretty dull characters.
I have no idea how this film has got 79% on Rotten Tomatoes, this film is forgettable and a bit rubbish. And a bit dumb.
It seems to be attempting to set up a franchise too, my guess is one that would be rubbish too.
The whole film feels like one of those cliche 80s-90s horror slashers where you know the formula and have seen the movie before you've even bought your ticket.
The only interesting thing would be some of the monster designs and the overall base idea for the film, it would have been better if we got to see the wendigo hunting story it teased. The movie is nothing special but a throw away popcorn flick. When your horror movie isn't scary, Maybe try something new rather then copy hundreds of older movies again and again.
I understand this was based on a book series but the movie just felt like the echo of many other cliche movies rather then it's own thing.
But that is my opinion, go see it for yourself if you're a fan of dull popcorn horror movies.

But 30 minutes into your mystery movie you realize WHY you've never heard of it and you turn it off because you're no longer interested in giving the movie your time?

The story is completely unbelievable even for a supernatural fiction (what kind of cop doesn't call the parent of a teen, and just locks them in a cell despite knowing her parent?) there was inconsistencies in the story (broken nudie pen at beginning of the money, then somehow re appears as a way to announce a child has been killed, unbroken) and the ending just felt like nothing more than a set up for a sequel.I wanted so badly for this to be good as the source material was truly terrifying and could have made for a very interesting movie, but unfortunately it's a let down.",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark

682,nicholas_ord,Atmospheric and funny but falls short of greatness in the last half-hour,6,14 April 2020,"I enjoyed the first hour, very atmospheric (I even thought it was actually scary in parts - all the early stuff in the haunted house and the 'scarecrow' bit were great).I also liked the 60's/Nixon/Vietnam backdrop, so it juxtaposed a halycyon, apple-pie, drive-in aesthetic of America, with its bold, 'Happy Days,' primary colours against the looming shadow of the country's (at that point) darkest chapter. I liked the sweet-sour note of (the ridiculously attractive, Mexican James Dean-alike) Ramon leaving to enlist for Vietnam at the end. That stung in an excellently poignant way.It was just a shame the final third descended into a dodgy-cgi action-fest and they fluffed the story-reveal (I had to google afterwards to get it). It was a great movie up until around the 'jangly-man/prison cell,' scene.I also think they did such a good job of setting up the bully-kid (in the letterman-jacket, who became the scarecrow) as the primary antagonist that it was a shame to waste his relationship with the other characters. It would have been scarier and carried much more pathos had HE stalked them through the rest of the movie, instead of the random monsters.Good film but I can't help think it was a missed opportunity for a REALLY good one.",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark
