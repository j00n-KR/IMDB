0,kosmasp,The Cave,7,13 January 2021,"Weird German title they gave this, but who am I to judge? The reviewer of this? Well one of them, but that's the german production company who's responsible (they did add more to the title, but they seemed eager to tell us where we'll hang out most of the ... time! No pun intended).All that aside, I thought this was going to be more a kid friendly affair. Not by anything I read, but by how this was presented on Prime. Even so I thought the tone was off. But since this is a low budget Science Fiction movie I do give it some points for originality. Can't say if that will play a role for you or not ... just be aware of it. Acting is good enough and there is a lot of guessing going on, to where this is leading ... is that enticing enough for you though?",Time Trap
1,Sleepin_Dragon,It isn't the Goonies...,4,16 April 2020,"....not certainly wasn't, that was fun and energetic, this was just incredibly boring, I can forgive bad films for getting things wrong when they at least aim to be daring. This film is so incredibly safe, that your interest just will not be held for very long. There are some good ideas, but the realisation just doesn't work. The acting was ok, but the material they're working with is generally poor. 4/10",Time Trap
2,CinemaSerf,Time Tripe,5,16 April 2020,"Hmmm - so an archaeology professor descends deep into a cave and, quite literally, disappears off the face of the earth, A group of his concerned students decide to investigate and before they realise it, they too are trapped deep underground in some sort of time anomaly. Mark Dennis (writer/director) now presents us with an amalgam of what look like rehashed ""Stargate SG-1"" episodes; the acting is dreadful - a beefcake and lots of shrieking dialogue and although the special effects are quite decent, the thing just doesn't cut it. Do they escape - well you'll just have to watch and see - but I'm not sure I'd bother...",Time Trap
3,Calicodreamin,Interesting concept,7,27 September 2019,"The storyline behind this movie is actually very interesting. A cave system contains the fountain of youth and when you enter, time slows down. Then enter the different groups of people and their interactions. I found the acting fairly good, especially from the kids, furby was a bit annoying. The concept was very interesting but I didn't think the ending wasn't all that well developed. But then I don't think I could have come up with anything better. Just very interesting.",Time Trap
4,Aaron1375,I was underwhelmed by this trap,4,19 November 2019,"Saw this film on Netflix, not sure if it was one of their movies or not. If so, it falls into the category of disappointing Netflix films that I have watched that had a good premise, but just felt flat to me. From the score here, I am in the minority; however, if I don't like something, I don't like it. This one was not the worst movie ever to me by any means, I just feel it was too uneven and did not seem to know what kind of movie it wanted to be. Throw in a cast of idiots whose motivations and actions are totally stupid and you have your movie.The story has an archaeologist wanting to explore some caves that his parents apparently went into and never came back. He goes missing, and two of his students or something just have to track him down and they bring three other kids with them, because if I am going to track someone down who I am not related to I want to endanger as many lives as I possibly can. Well, they enter these caves and time is going super slow within, meaning outside time is speeding by and it takes forever for the motley crew of wannabe adventurers to grasp the situation even when confronted with video evidence.The film just does not work as at times it almost has a horror vibe going for it with the death of the annoying Furby who everyone is so sad for even though two of the characters just met him before the trip. Why they take this kid is beyond me, once again, why are they endangering lives when it is obvious the archeologist had to have gotten into some type of trouble. We get killer cavemen, vague spacemen and an eye rolling happy ending to finish off a film that should have done things a bit more differently as the main characters stare up at the one outlet of the cave for way too long.So a film that has too many flaws for me to rate it any better than four. I liked aspects of it as it was kind of creepy at the beginning when the professor saw the perfectly still man within the caves. This is undermined by too many stupid decisions though as the dude with the teens is an idiot, putting everyone at risk for his teacher? Hell no, I would not go out of my way to rescue any of my teachers, much less involving people who have nothing to do with class!",Time Trap
5,siderite,Criminally underrated,9,21 October 2018,"This film is a beautiful example of what people can do when they put their mind to it. Unknown (teens and children included) actors doing a very decent job, an interesting and original concept, a true work of speculative science fiction, special effects just enough to tell the story with no superfluous and flashy mambo jumbo, it was an almost perfect movie.It was strange to see such a low rating on IMDb. This is an indie film that blew me away. I've seen A-rated actors perform worse in really stupid scripts. If you want something that really feels different and is also interesting and captivating, you've got to see this. I was frankly surprised to see that it was an US movie. I had expected to be from New Zealand or Canada or some other place where they care about the quality of cinema, but don't have the money.There are, of course, some problems. One of them is the title, which gives too much away too soon. Then there are the reactions of actors in certain situations that make little sense, details of the script that were not smoothed out when writing it or when directing it. Some sciency things they got wrong, too, but it's peanuts compared to the superhero crap that you see everywhere nowadays.Bottom line: Expected it to be a lame film, got pleasantly surprised by how entertaining it was. I love films that are made by people with respect for the art.",Time Trap
6,sddavis63,A Decent Premise Burdened By Weak Execution,5,4 December 2019,"I thought the premise of ""Time Trap"" was decent. A group of young people (ranging from a couple of pre-teens to some university graduate students) go off on a search for a professor who's gone missing. In their search they come across a mysterious cave where they believe the professor has gone to explore, and once inside they discover they're trapped and that time is passing at a different rate inside the cave than outside. While time for them (inside) is normal, they realize that constantly shifting light patterns they see are actually the rising and setting of the sun and that time outside the cave is passing at an incredibly rapid pace. Inside, they discover an assortment of people who've come into the cave from different time periods - from ""cavemen"" to a futuristic type. I have to give credit to those who developed the basic story. It was mysterious and intriguing. I liked it.The performances in this were inconsistent - fair at best. The cast was a definite ""B"" list of actors at best. It's interesting to me - and perhaps it says something - that most of those who were in leading roles in this haven't really done much of note since. As intriguing as the story was there were also some inconsistencies that bugged me a bit. If time was moving faster outside the cave than inside, then why didn't Furby age (even die, for that matter - because a lot of time would have passed for him relative to the others) during the time that he was outside while the others were inside? I also thought this movie ended rather too abruptly. More often than not I think writers try to milk a story and make it go on for too long. In this case, I thought a few extra minutes might have been productive. Without giving anything away - what kind of world did those in the cave finally emerge into? The comment was made that ""we're pretty big news here"" or words to that effect. I would have liked to have learned just a wee bit more about where and to whom they were pretty big news. I don't think there's enough to this to warrant a sequel - but tying up that loose end with maybe another 15 minutes would have been positive.So, essentially, I thought there was a positive premise and a half decent story with some mystery involved. But it failed a little bit in its execution. (5/10)",Time Trap
7,851222,Great Sci-Fi gem,8,13 March 2019,"Greetings from Lithuania.Writer and director of ""Time Trap"" (2017) clearly did not had gazillions of dollars, but this movie is a proof that you can make a very involving Sci-Fi movies having a very good idea. This movie had a very good idea, pretty good writing and OK acting as well as solid directing - all combined ""Time Trap"" is a very involving story for those who enjoy good Sci-Fi stories.Overall, i won't spoil it, but ""Time Trap"" took me by surprise. I would definitely recommend this movie for those who like really good Sci-Fi stories and don't mind of a movie that does not have a huge sets and stars. A very good Sci-Fi gem.",Time Trap
8,tabuno,Well done,9,28 January 2019,"There is something refreshingly authentic along with a creative use of concurrent flashback and flashforward segments at the beginning of the movie. While some critics have problems with some of the characters, especially the young boy who seems pretty obnoxious, he really doesn't completely fall into the repulsive stereotype and instead seems to reflect a pretty normal, above average intelligent pre-adolescent fixation on the opposite sex. The beginning twist of the movie is quite ingenious as two simultaneous film plots weave in and out of an actually logical sequence rarely scripted in other time travel movies, though the passage of time seems to be unbelievably unnoticed by our educated professor. In the tradition of the little known Peter Fonda's Idaho Transfer (1973) time travel movie, Time Trap has an even more subdued but yet strong psychological substrate that makes this movie really powerful in its depiction of time dilation without all the exotic bells and whistles, amazing special effects, and action thrillers which really in some ways detracts from the real experience of time travel. The lost found video technique is well used in this movie and is very convincing and effective in moving the story and ominous movie tone forward. At almost the midpoint of the movie, there is a shocking and wonderfully creepy scene that is amazingly good, a reveal at this point that is gorgeously exquisite in the same visionary mold of Interstellar (2014). This loosely updated version of The Time Machine (1960) really hangs together all they way through to the exciting climax. A great low-budget movie that really works and excels in presenting time dilation in a creative, exciting, and actually uplifting manner - well worth the price and time of viewing. This rare movie captures both the popular mainstream of youthful exuberance for its target audience along with the serious, smooth flowing science fiction theme to the very end. Well done.",Time Trap
9,Platypuschow,Time Trap: Has a concept that gives it the edge,7,31 May 2018,"I'm not a huge sci-fi guy so these types of movies usually start off with an immediate disadvantage especially considering the lack of budget and thought that normally goes into them.Time Trap tells the story 5 youngster who go into an underground cave system in search of their missing lecturer only to discover that time works differently within its confines.Immediatly I was struck by the concept, this was really quite original and they handled it very well. Sure the cast were instantly forgettable but I was gripped regardless as this was really quite fascinating stuff.The sfx were oddly on point as well and because of this I had expectations that this really might be something special.As the movie progresses it does go off the rails a tad, the plot gets a bit messy and when the credits roll you'll be left with an annoying quanity of unanswered questions.Regardless this is really quite an entertaining sci-fi b-movie and well worth a watch.The Good:Very originalLooks goodThe Bad:Feels like a failed tv pilotNot everything is explainedThings I Learnt From This Movie:Cave systems are naturally illuminated",Time Trap
10,paulclaassen,From good to bad to terrible...,3,27 August 2018,"The film starts off very interesting with some nice, likable characters. It was a fun, mysterious, exciting film - for the first 50 minutes, at least. From there it goes from bad to terrible. It became more comical than serious (despite their circumstances!) and very theatrical. It then felt like a school production. There were so little enthusiasm from the actors and the characters, it actually became laughable - in a bad way. Nothing was believable anymore and I thought I was watching the school production rehearsal! The film also ended on a silly Disney-ish note.This was an interesting idea, but sadly very badly executed.",Time Trap
11,zkonedog,"Some Interesting Ideas, But Lacking The Chutzpah To Pull Them Off",5,1 January 2020,"As a sucker for any piece of entertaining with a time-travel bend, I stumbled upon this indie film and gave it a chance. What I found was a movie that had some very interesting concepts, but lacked the experience both in front of and behind the camera to pull them all off.For a very basic overview, this film sees Hopper (Andrew Wilson), an archeology professor, go missing in a series of underground caves. Three of his students (played by Cassidy Gifford, Brianne Howey, and Reiley McClendon) and two tag-along youngsters (Olivia Draguicevich & Max Wright) go on a rescue mission and stumble across a time phenomenon hidden deep within the earth that puts all of their lives deeply at risk.I'll start with the positives here: The setup in this film is solid, as it takes its time to introduce the characters and give them their own personalities. For a picture that barely runs 90 minutes, that is a pretty remarkable feat. ""Time Trap"" also incorporates some interesting science fiction and time-travel concepts into its mix. If ever for a second things start to slow down, there's usually always another twist right around the corner.Sadly (because there is a real kernel of a solid film here), ""Time Trap"" falls into two traps that prevent it from being all that great:First, it renders it's characters far too cautious or unbelieving of the events transpiring around them at all times. When you title a film ""Time Trap"" and tease time-related paranormal events in the trailer, you are priming the audience for a certain experience, and thus the characters within the film have to somewhat oblige. Having them doubt the events all the way up to the very end of the picture makes for a frustrating viewing experience, as we (the audience) know the type of movie we are watching.Secondly, the filmmakers simply bite off far more than they can chew. Each idea or plot point they give time to is interesting in its own right, but instead of settling down to focus on one or two of them, ""Time Trap"" goes for the ""quantity over quality"" approach. What results is a bit of a mess of ideas in which none of them really land emotionally in the end (despite all being interesting at the start).Overall, I rate ""Time Trap"" as pretty straight down the middle. It held my interest, but made far too many mistakes to ever really be considered ""good"" or ""recommendable"", either. I have a lot of respect for indie filmmaking, so perhaps that is why I'm a bit harsh on this one: it came close to really being a solid film, but simply failed in too many key areas to ultimately make that happen.",Time Trap
12,Tweetienator,Got Some Issues But Still Good,7,17 May 2019,"Nice little sci-fi flick with an unique idea/concept. Not everything in that movie is strong (some scenes are rather out of tune regarding the overall ""tone"" of the movie) but all in all I enjoyed watching Time Trap and was pleasantly surprised.

13,RosanaBotafogo,Very Good...,9,23 August 2020,"I loved the idea, the execution was a little bizarre, technical quality impoverished, the teen atmosphere, with teenagers I don't know, made it beneficial or harmful, but as I don't pay attention to these facts, and I love movies with children and boring, I really liked it, I loved it realization, the outcome, a well-produced remake will be very interesting in the future...",Time Trap
14,henry8-3,Time Trap,5,6 April 2019,"A bunch of young people go off in search of a professor who has gone missing. They go into a cave where time seems to stand still while outside the cave it moves at great speed.With so many lovely young people involved in this boy's own adventure it kicks off like a typical Enid Blyton story. However, the playing with time element is handled quite well and considering the budget, this is far better than it might have been.

15,iquine,Unrefined Yet Intriguing,7,26 December 2019,"(Flash Review)Some teen hikers head into a deep cave looking for an older hiker who may have found the fountain of youth. Once inside, time passes at an extremely slower rate than on the surface. With that amount of passage of time, other people from vastly different eras are bound to explore this case to and intersect. See how that plays out, will the teen hikers understand what is going on and will they ever get back to their families? While certainly not at a Christopher Nolan level, it held its own. Moments of intrigue mixed with some underdeveloped points. The movie quickly spells out the dramatics dilemmas with nothing left to ponder. A fun Sci-Fi movie nonetheless.",Time Trap
16,jimbo-53-186511,"There are flaws within the narrative, but for the most part it's gripping and intense",7,7 June 2019,"An archaeology professor (Andrew Wilson) enters a cave and subsequently goes missing. A couple of his students and their friends decide to go and look for him and soon begin to learn why he may have gone missing... Things become even worse for the group when they find themselves trapped in the cave and they begin to learn that time is passing by much faster in the 'real' world...Considering it's been made on a shoestring budget with a relatively unknown cast Time Trap definitely has more positives than negatives. Director Mark Dennis keeps things tight and fairly suspenseful (at an early stage we know the group are not alone in the cave, but not knowing who or what is down there and what is going to happen to the group is part of what keeps things intriguing). The film is nicely-framed and it is quite well-structured in terms of the way the story unfolds - this is mostly achieved via recorded camera footage from one of the group who sadly met his maker whilst trying to find the rest of the group. Naturally, the hook here is how or if the group will get out, whether they'll find their professor and what else is down there and on the whole it is a fairly satisfying and involving experience.That being said and as much as I enjoyed this film I did find some of the writing to be a bit sloppy and lazy; for example out of nowhere and with no explanation some kind of gigantic Robocop/alien/human drops a massive ladder down into the cave and starts kicking loads of Neanderthal ass - it transpires that 1000's of years have passed on Planet Earth where as only a short period of time has passed by in the cave due to the group passing through some kind of space time continuum as is explained to the group via a news reel that the giant shows them. I can buy that humanity may have been wiped out over a long period of time and that there may now just be a small master alien race, but what isn't explained is how this other race found them?? Or did I miss something there? It's possible that they may have seen Kara on top of the rock face (as is shown by what may have been the spaceship approaching, but this is just my supposition).To me it seemed that this incident was created just to give the film an ending - if I'm honest I did find this a fairly lazy and cheap way to end the film. You knew as soon as the alien guy arrived that they were going to be OK and I had no doubt that he was a good guy as soon as I saw him (despite attempts that were made to wrong-foot the audience into thinking he was a baddie).So yes for me it tailed off slightly towards the end and I have to admit that I did not like the convenient way that the film ended, but narrative weaknesses aside this is still a solid, gripping, intense, character-driven experience and I did like the idea that Neanderthals were living within the time continuum - I presume they are still at the dawn of civilisation because time moves very slowly where they are (at least that's my theory anyway). Warts and all then it's a very good film tarnished slightly by the group's escape being just a little too convenient and easy.",Time Trap

19,TdSmth5,Good idea that needed a better execution,7,9 August 2021,"Some archeology professor goes looking for his missing hippie parents who disappeared after looking for the fountain of youth in some caves. He does find the caves. Returns home to prepare to go inside the caves. He refuses to take any of his students with him. After he doesn't return they go looking for him, two of his students and for some reason two young kids as well.They find his car and the entrance to the cave. Past a certain threshold in the cave, there some barrier of moisture, once they cross it, they are inside. The professor also noticed that. He also saw some cowboy somehow static.The kids go all the way in while one of them stays outside. Then all the ropes they used to climb down break and they are stuck. Then they find an opening to the outside. But they notice that there the sun passes by real fast. One girl climbs outside only to find a wasteland and some type of space station floating around.She goes back down and they realize that in the cave, time goes by slower, much slower than on the outside. Then a guy from the future climbs down and attacks a bunch of neanderthals that show up. They find their professor who has been shot, presumably by the cowboy for unknown reasons.Eventually they are provided with a way to climb out into the future.I really enjoy the ideas of this movies: fountain of youth and a cave where time passes differently than on the outside. Both are ideas that are part of universal lore that have rarely been taken up by filmmakers.The problem here is the execution that should have made more of the fountain of youth theme and that should have created more tension with the whole time traveling business. Dialogue isn't all that good here and the behavior of the characters doesn't make sense more often than not.

20,masonfisk,FUN ON A BUDGET...!,10,30 August 2020,"From 2017 comes this story of a teacher (who's obsessed on finding out where his parents disappeared to years before) has found their old van in a clearing which leads to a cave. From the cave's entrance we can see a cowboy (from yesteryear) moving at a snail's pace through a miasma of air. Returning home to fortify his provisions, he runs into his students & he lets them know about his discovery but discourages them from following along. Curiosity is too great however & the students soon joined by others, follow in the teacher's footsteps only to find they get trapped in the same time pocket. From the top of the cave a ceiling portal resides where we can see time passing quickly (the students surmise days but it's actually years) so when one of the students climbs to the top (2 are hurt due to their ropes being frayed causing it to snap) we see the lush forest they once entered is now a rocky landscape of devastation. Expanding over the course of 90 minutes (actually less!), this scifi miracle gives the viewer enough fuel for the mind & soul than any Christopher Nolan bloastfest could ('take notes' as a friend always espoused!) w/the wise choice of using unknown actors (who rise to the level of this endeavor) keeping the focus on the matters at hand (no love side plots or asides about lost parents).

A group of friends were trapped there and many surprised things come to know after that. There was a full nature's season get passed within a second then how can you imagine that how many years passed so far since you entered in that trapped. The idea is amazing and director told explanation in very possible ways. I am thankful to him for the same. However, the story has many loopholes as they should have in every science fiction movie. But movies are only to enjoy and let those loopholes get overlooked. In acting side Brianne Howey is well played her role especially in starting moments of the movie where she calls Teller's ( Reiley McClendon) girlfriend to speak with Teller.

30,carbuff,Originality overcomes pedestrian production values and acting,8,1 December 2019,"I would much rather watch dinkly little Sci-Fi flicks like ""Time Trap"" any day of the week rather than the latest installment of something like the multi-trillion dollar budget ""Star Wars"" live action cartoons. By the looks of it, an awful lot of people could have funded this movie with a 401k loan; however, nonetheless, it beats the odds and is very good. The plot can reasonably be called original (although, of course, nearly everything people do is derivative to some degree). ""Time Trap"" managed to keep me intrigued throughout. While viewing I found it very easy to suspend disbelief, even though the low budget and mediocre acting are right in your face all the time, because the story was such a decent breath of fresh air. So, if you're interested in a bit of Sci-Fi and you're tired of the same-old, same-old, give this one a shot. If nothing else, it's short enough that you won't feel that you've lost too much of your life to it. I'm sure that if I devoted some serious thinking to it, I could come up with a bunch of plot holes on top of those that were obvious to me, but since ""Time Trap"" was such an enjoyable diversion, that doesn't bother me at all.

We also based our views on the title of the film so as I'd never heard of this film and it came out in 2017, also to be honest with you the title didn't inspire much confidence I honestly thought this would be yet another poorly made film with terrible acting, how wrong I was.Absolutely loved this original (yes original) film which had me on the edge of my seat on a number of occasions.A series of caves distort time, where it moves much slower than on the surface, each second a year passing by, 1 minute is 60 years, 1 hour is 3,600 years and so on. What would happen on the surface during that time while you're in the cave?As I said if there wasn't a shortage of films to watch at the moment I think I would have passed on this film simply because of the title but I'm glad I didn't as I really enjoyed this one.Rating 9 out of 10.",Time Trap

35,kuarinofu,Not exactly a mind bender but the ideas are there,6,26 January 2020,"Time trap is sort of a mix of the 80ties adventure films (which they reference a lot in this) and a low budget sci-fi that has a general understanding of what it wants to be but goes off the rails along the way.But beware, this is not a thinking man's low budget sci-fi.It has an interesting start and feels quite engaging at first, young women are a little oversexualized here but this is for the younger male audiences I'm sure.While the premise seems obvious enough it still takes a lot of time for the characters to actually start dealing with the story. They really should've spent more time on something interesting rather than running around, which they do in excess. They just throw more and more at you and then the ending sort of comes out of nowhere.Without digging too much into the story, I kind of enjoyed this as a sci-fi fan just for the general idea of it. It was still unfocused and all over the place but I give them credit for sticking with their own ideas.This could've been easily improved with some writing adjustments but it's fine for what it is. Not exactly a family adventure film and not really a budget intelligent sci-fi but something in-between.",Time Trap
36,Darkside-Reviewer,Great Story Concept,6,20 February 2021,Time Trap (2017) is one of the weirdest yet surprisingly interesting science fiction films I have seen in a very long time. The idea is that a group of students and friends go looking for a missing archeology professor who went missing while he was also looking for a group of people who mysteriously went missing somewhere in the mountains forty years prior. The group discover a mysterious cave with ropes descending into it. They assume the professor went to explore the cave and had some kind of accident so they descend into the cave to find him. However they soon discover the reason why no one's ever returned from the caves depths. Time acts differently inside the cave with years going by in a matter of seconds and the deeper they descend the more time speeds up or stops altogether leaving people and objects frozen in time forever.The story concept is unique and interesting it kept my interest right until the very end. I admire what the makers of this film were able to accomplish with this film. The budget for the film was only around one million dollars (US) which is hardly anything. Ironically though this low budget science fiction film has much better writing and direction than other science fiction films that have budgets in the tens of millions. The acting is also surprisingly good for a low budget science fiction film.I highly recommend watching Time Trap (2017) especially if your a fan of well written science fiction films that don't rely heavily on CGI and special effects.,Time Trap

40,phenomynouss,enough cool stuff and ideas to overcome the awful acting and rambling plot,7,26 October 2019,"It feels a bit like cheating to spoil any of the film.the initial concept was neat enough to continue to hold my interest even after the very first character speech let us know just how badly acted the film was going to be.
Some guy, Professor Hopper, is searching in a cave for evidence of the fate of a couple of hippies who disappeared in the cave back in the 1970s. Their van is still outside of the cave as well. As was told to us in the synopsis of the film, we learn that the cave is a ""time trap""
namely the cave is severely affected by relativity, in that time moves more slowly in the cave than outside of it, much like Miller's Planet in ""Interstellar"" where 1 hour on the planet correlates to 7 years off world.
This film is rather simplistic and relies on a bit of expo-dumping in the form of speculation and video tape. While an immense amount of subtlety would've probably still made the movie work, that would've depended on the movie being much better written.
Whether the filmmakers were aware of their shortcomings or not, they made sure to make up for the shortcomings with wild sci-fi ideas that seamlessly merge with the plot, along with some remarkably good CGI and costumes.

The first 45 minutes or so I was invested, it had me hooked and I was intrigued. But as the title says, it all just fell apart. They tried making it too complicated and bizarre and it just fell flat. There was so many different ways this film could have gone and this would have made it better.I didn't get the cavemen that were down there. There was no point of them other to cause a slight bit of danger, which only occurs in the 2nd half of the film. I just didn't understand that whole thing.

So what gives it an eight in score, well for sci-fi it is something different and does try very hard, the vfx are good, the humour enough and in the end a happy marriage of actors which clearly had fun. Yes the usual questions arise in the storyline but only if you're being pedantic, it's sci-fi, it's not real life. Thusly sit back, relax and take it for what it is, plain fun.

I gather it was made on a shoestring so the writer/directors deserve credit for pulling off whatever they have pulled off. It's not really clear: what starts as a teen movie becomes a 'will they, won't they' adventure, then a sci-fi puzzler with no end of hokum, and ends finally on an upbeat note which I doubt any of us saw coming. I certainly didn't.Along the way we touch upon - but swiftly pass by - any number of stock sci-fi tropes, as well as dip a toe in a some vague mythology, before alls well that ends well.That at the end of the day, and despite initial hopes and suggestions of a white picket fence all-American apple pie happy ending, nothing much adds up to a row of beans curiously doesn't matter.If the journey is more significant than the arrival Time Warp just about pulls it off. And the pre-teen to late-night viewing half-drunk student market will feel well served. The rest of us?

Anyways, this was a cool little sci fi tale, once you get over that initial feeling of an after school special. It starts out with one of the Wilson brothers, ya know the brothers that look nothing alike but all share that whiny voice, them. It's Andrew this time, he plays Hopper, a professor who is out looking for a rumored treasure that his hippie parents once went looking for and disappeared. Hopper find his parents VW van, and a little poking around he discovers a cave... And several days later after Hopper has seemingly disappeared himself, a group of students decide to get together and hunt for him, and instead of letting the authorities know, they bring two children with them, because, why not? They follow Hopper's trail and come to the same cave system and enter, one of the children, decides to stay on the outside, and its actually thanks to him they figure out what is sam hell is going on. The group enter the cave and instantly notice a flashing light, thy laugh it off thinking the boy on the outside is flashing his light at them... foolish lol. And as they wander deeper into the cave, well they find a body, that of the boy waiting for them, with a cam around his neck, the gang watches the video and discover something quite creepy. Speaking into the camera the boy describes waiting for his friends to return for days, being in the middle of nowhere, and no way to get home, he goes into the cave himself in search of them, however he enters a different area obvi, and climbs down using a rope, once entering the cave, the rope appears to be severed and he falls and suffers an injury. The gang now thinks how?? They've been down there for minutes, not days. And now lost in a cave system where each clue they find points to a Time Trap, maybe??? Like I said it does have a low budget feel to it, and the acting isn't so hot (side note: all the actors in this seem to be doppelgangers of other actors, I swear!)

61,gengar843,"Complicated Theme, Good Enough To Be a Series Pilot!",8,18 May 2018,"BOTTOM LINE: Interesting premise makes ordinary ""oops we shouldn't have done this"" film into a pretty good time-paradox entry. B+PREMISE & LOGIC: There are places on Earth where people get lost and never found (eg, Bermuda Triangle) because time moves slower there. This means thousands of years can pass outside these places but only a few hours pass inside. This is one of those places, with layers of time paradox within. Logic can be suspended as long as writing is consistent and follows through. This film delivers because it is not simply an excuse for appealing teens to be hunted in terror, but rather is the gateway to a multitude of possible outcomes. CHARACTERS: I get them, in a one-dimensional fashion. Many such 1-D characters are unlikeable because they're cliches, caricatures or just obnoxious. Here, they are just ordinary enough to enjoy, and just extraordinary enough to believe in their ability to survive. Nothing unique, but the writers kept it simple and pleasant. Refreshingly, the cast does not engage in social commentary distractions, so dialogue is driven by nothing more high-minded than situation and attachment. PLOT: The trajectory is fine, and the outcome and resolutions satisfying enough, given who these people are and what's going on. However, and there is a however, the movie tries to do too much. While indeed there must be tragedy to overcome into triumph, some of the ""Flintstones"" scenes were too simplistic to be so long. The multiple layers of time compression were also just so much window dressing, with no exposition beyond showing it. So it ends up, even with a unique ending, like a pretty good episode of the old Irwin Allen LOST IN SPACE, which is not a bad thing!OVERALL: Setting up these likeable characters, and leaving aspects of time-slip unexplored, added up to me desiring this to be a pilot for a TV series, which is how it plays, rather than a self-contained movie experience. It reminds me a bit of Sliders, though that cast was more charismatic, and one might rightly also say it should continue episodically like Quantum Leap or Time Tunnel.",Time Trap

Low-budget movies CAN be great.,9,30 April 2018,"While not going into a lot of unnecessary detail, I, somewhat forcibly, have a lot of free time on my hands and not a lot of options about what to do with it. I know, sounds like fun. It isn't.So I watch a lot of movies. Since great movies are fairly few, I end up watching a lot of trashy movies whether I like it or not. Low budgets, low-quality special-effects, low quality acting and etc. are a daily diet for me. I'm an expert on films where someone said, ""Hey! Let's make a movie in the barn!""TIME TRAP is a real rarity. While not a summer blockbuster or awards night darling, it somehow manages to be both cheap'n'cheesy and a really good, entertaining movie. It's proof that just because you have to make a movie with your allowance money doesn't mean the resulting flick has to be unwatchable.Perforce, the plot is very simple. If you think about it, nature is full of surprisingly large-scale booby-traps. As examples: the La Brea tar pits have trapped countless thousands of animals for literally tens of thousands of years (and even one human girl). Whole valleys located near volcanically active areas have seen entire populations of animals wiped out by escaping poison fumes. Even whole large-scale dinosaur nesting sites, complete with nesting dinosaurs and eggs, have been wiped out en masse by some natural disaster or other. Sinkholes and caves with vertical walls have been treasure troves of ancient animal skeletons trapped over thousands of years.And so on.Similarly, in TIME TRAP, we have a cave system that, for some unexplained reason, has varying levels of time ""bubbles"" within which time is operating on different scales relative to the larger, outside world. Anyone venturing within the cave system becomes ""trapped"" in the sense that while they are inside the cave system they are like bugs trapped in amber, effectively frozen in time while the outside world races ahead in ""normal"" timescale. Technically, people CAN leave, but if they've been within the cave system for any length of time beyond a minute or so, the outside world will have changed beyond recognition when they return to it.Many of the situations that you might imagine given such a plot description properly play out in the movie. Characters standing outside any time bubble (or within a ""faster"" time bubble) view other characters standing in other bubbles as either frozen statues or vanishing in an instant. Moving from one bubble to the next, characters who were looking like statues suddenly start moving. Throwing an object from one bubble to another sees that object suddenly freeze in midair. Standing inside a time bubble and looking out upon the outside world one sees the sun flashing by in streaks, very similar to what one sees in any time machine movie.Fascinatingly, again like bugs caught in amber, over the eons, humans from different eras and different levels of evolution have become ""trapped"" within the system. The characters which represent the protagonists in the movie encounter everything from cavemen to people from the future. There's one particular scene which depicts an ongoing free-for-all brawl occurring within an especially slow-moving time bubble featuring and including people from many different eras. Wonderfully imaginative.There are a few relative-time errors within the movie that the viewer has to turn a blind eye to in the name of poetic license. TIME TRAP is somewhat careful in laying out the speed of the time differential between the outside world and the main bubble that our protagonists are trapped within and then clearly violates those time relationships in order to play out some poignant scenes between some of the characters that know each other. Oh, well. Wink wink nudge nudge, give the makers a break. Considering how well they did with the rest of the picture, made with $1.95, I choose to let this one go. Most movies with these sorts of resource origins have too many screw-ups to count. All things considered, TIME TRAP does a pretty nice job with its premise.I gave this movie a 9/10 which some people might interpret as my claiming that it's on a par with RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK or something, which is not my intent. I simply feel that a low-end movie that rises so far above its station should be well rewarded. TIME TRAP is what it is, and judged relative to the other movies in the bargain bin it comes from, it is a sort of RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK of the stand next to the checkout counter.",Time Trap

I wasn't going to watch it because it was a bunch of kids, and generally in sci-fi/disaster movies, the kids are unbearable. I was wrong on that score, too. In fact, the Furby character was great.
The concept is so interesting. I'd like to see it in some other, big-budget film some day, to see what might be done with it. OTOH, this wasn't pretentious, just a straight-forward adventure. Good stuff. Only quibble, kinda wish everybody in the cave had been rescued :) Why not? :)",Time Trap
69,JurijFedorov,Interesting idea made into a simple kids movie,7,29 August 2018,"As the other reviewers point out the execution of the idea is lacking while the idea itself is great.The idea is simple. A cave is a time trap. Everything in there happens at a normal pace. But the time inside the cave moves extremely slowly compared to the time outside of the cave.A professor gets into the cave and his students and 2 extra teenagers follow him for some weird reason. And not one of them tells the outside world where they are going. Again, for some weird reason. The plot is extremely forced and it's completely unbelievable. It makes zero sense that these teenagers would take a kid to some weird and dangerous cave that people have died in or at. Well, now they are stuck in the cave and have to discover how to get out while trying to beat off the cave men. The concept is just amazing and the story should have been so much better written and filmed. The kids constantly talk. And most of it is small talk. For example, they walk into the cave and the scene by itself is interesting. But there is no quiet scene. They always chit chat or make simple plans that often make very little sense. The aliens make little sense too. And there are so many plot holes that the movie is one big character plot hole. They seem to run away from situations that are not dangerous or not help out when they very easily could help out. Basically all characters kinda just do the bare minimum and all seem stupid. I also don't really know any of the characters that well as they all talked the same way and all are very basic. I know one character likes to have fun, another character is strong, a third character is a good climber, the kid is irritating. That's basically it. That's their full character traits.It's worth watching because something always happens and new things constantly appear. But at the end of the day this could have been some really great and deep movie. What it is is just some silly fun movie with bad action scenes, bad acting and mediocre plot. It's not boring because the concept itself always is there to interest the viewer. But this should have been so much better. For example, the characters they search for initially went to the cave in the 70's. But none of the characters have a single line in the movie even though we do see their bodies and do see them resurrected at the end. Basically when they get out of the cave there is nothing else happening. The professor just looks at his parents. He doesn't even greet them. And the boy who liked the girl and the girl who liked him back? Well, nothing is done with that either. There is no character development. No deep character exploration. Just teenagers running from one danger to another danger and at the end aliens save them from the cave. There is so much character potential here. So much theme potential. But the writer chose to not do a single thing with it because they just kept adding antagonists to the cave instead of exploring one topic in depth. The plot is a professor searching for him parents. And then his students search for him while solving their own teenage conflicts. But all of this is abandoned 20 minutes into the movie and we get no answers to any personal searches or conflicts.The by far best scenes where the professor getting out of the cave and the girl getting out of the cave. Finally we saw real emotion and not chit chat or stupid plans. We saw them explore an unknown thing. That was great! But the writer didn't give us much of this at all.I think I will sit down and write a better movie based on this concept. A deeper movie that actually has a theme and is not just based on new characters appearing all the time. There is a good idea here but at the end of the day it's just a silly kids movie that is very forgettable.",Time Trap

It does not really look professional expensive, but the story was well told with the resources they had. The scenario is simple, a frequently used theme - the relativity of time. I like how the story was told, because the story seems logical in many ways. I would like to see a sequel and wish the producer and director had more money for a sequel to tell more. The conclusion of the movie is not closing. Some viewers could be disappointed, because the story has an open end. Even though the movie was very entertaining for us, I think it's difficult to find a part of the whole audience to recommend it to. It might need some experience in time-travel stories to understand the issue of this movie. So I would recommend it to people which are interested in fictional views of time traveling or the relativity of time.",Time Trap

Easily done without a major spoiler. Hard to understand why IMDB's home page at the outset and also in the more detailed summary issue a major spoiler, one in great numerical detail. Perhaps one third of the movie leaves viewers in suspense as to what extraordinary event they have run into. But that has been 'spoiled' buy all reading IMDB's description and summary.Fortunately, we saw this film prior to reading IMDB's page.

Of course everyone in the movie is attractive, academically and athletically superior (they can all abseil so easily, give me a break!).But the biggest plot flaw is the time differentials. They were showing the sun go down and at the beginning thought it was a day every second or so but then realized it was actually a year every second or so. However their chubby little friend only spent a few hours before he attempted to go down the whole. When the professor at the beginning spent 8 seconds inside the cave, it was like a few months went by outside. No, it is not because different parts of the cave had different time ""bubbles"". You can re-watch and check.The equally huge flaw is: why would the water have healing abilities if there are temporal variances?This movie is a good amateur attempt at making a sci-fi.

Nevertheless, I wasted 1 hour and 15 minutes of my life on this movie, which should have been called Timecrap.Lame premise, sci fi story which was could have been written by a middle schooler, weak man from the future vs stupid looking cavemen, 3 girls and a guy actually discussing the option of staying in a cave the rest of their lives (of course, no food or water) - these 4 were really deep thinkers.

I just watched this and the release of this film is as puzzling as the story. Was it going to be a pilot? Was it supposed to have an open-ended finish or were they planning a sequel?
I enjoyed watching it and thought it was very imaginative and well paced in spite of the low budget appearance and slightly stilted acting though that was perhaps due to having to cope with some rather irritating dialogue. Was it originally made in another language and dubbed by not-great voice actors?

In short I bliming well loved it!Hopper, an archaeology professor goes caving looking for some missing hippies from the 1970's, after a few days he doesn't return so two of his students(Taylor and Jackie) take it upon themselves to go search for him, they bring along their friend Cara, who has to drag along her little sister Veeves and her best friend Furby -the writers obviously has reasons for these two names but they sound like a children's cartoon series to me - The Adventures of Furby and the Veeves!From the moment they enter the cave, then things don't go as you think, even when you have it figured out, a new twist happens, there's hippies, cavemen, cowboys, time travel, death, life and some very, very confused teenagers!I can't tell you more because I don't want to ruin it, I went into this, thinking it will kill 90 minutes on a Sunday night and came out of it absolutely loving 95% of the film - I say 95% as the last five minutes left me and Shell opened mouthed and with more questions than answers - which was really frustrating!
Reiley McClendon, Cassidy Gifford and Brianne Howey are superb as the three older teenagers, who carry most of the film and it is shame they are still waiting for something bigger to come along - though Brianne Howey is starting to get the recognition she deserves with roles in the superb and sadly cut short The Passage and Batwoman.If you've got 90 minutes spare and want your mind occasionally blown, then give this a go.

102,FixedYourEnding,Excellent family Sci-Fi movie - explanation,8,20 April 2020,"I had seen my share of disappointing 2nd rate science-fiction movies in the past (just check my other reviews): Sometime the acting is horrible, sometime the story is just silly, direction, photography these are all challenged on a low-budget production. However, Time-Trap actually managed to avoid most (if not all) of these pitfalls. It did, however, fall into the trap of angry reviewers not giving this movie a chance. Please don't be one of those people!Since this is a spoiler review, please keep reading only if you watched the movie and seeking some answers:
So what happens in Time Trap?
An age-old cave (let's say millions of years old) exists in the southern part of Texas, during the years different people went into that cave to explore or to seek shelter, including cavemen (20,000 years ago, Spaniards 1000 years ago and people from recent age). The parents of professor Hopper (Andrew Wilson) went into that cave in the 70's in order to find the fountain of youth, which would heal his younger sister almost instantly. They never came back.
Professor Hopper finds that cave and goes in to look for them, however, there is a catch- when you enter the cave you go through a time barrier. Inside the barrier the time goes much, much slower than the outside (in my calculation - every 10 seconds is about 1 year on the outside)Ok, so what happens? Prof Hopper on his first visit does not go in the cave and he is free to go back home, on his 2nd visit he spends a short minute inside the cave but outside 10 years have passed enough for vegetation to grow all over his car, and he sees the other car of his students that went looking for him. As far as I can tell, all entries to the cave have the same effect and they are all connected. The students go into the cave from a different entrance but they are suffering the same experience.After they are there for a good part of a day, 1000's of years pass on the outside, so that futuristic (evolved) people from Mars eventually come visiting the cave. It creates a somewhat peculiar situation in which cavemen and futuristic people are in the same space. But for the cavemen only days have passed, for our protagonists- few hours, but theoretically can happen. Unfortunately at around year 3000 AD (when Cara pops her head out) earth is no longer inhabitable and people live either in space or on Mars. Our heroes will never be able to see their old family again.In the conclusion part, technology outside has evolved so much that they are able to create geographical conditions and technology to pull our protagonists out of the cave and heal them using the water taken from the fountain of youth. It is unclear how this technology works, to us it looks like alien-tech, but so would an iPhone in 1920. So there you have it- this is how it all works.What does not work in the movie? The cavemen are obviously actors from our time. Although they are trying to do a good job, their whole bone-structure should have been different and a high-budget movie could probably fix that. Secondly, the area where time slows even more (towards the end of the movie) is peculiar, why is the fountain not in that area if it's so protected? and cowboys and Spaniards only exist in there? Rope breaking all the time is also questionable but overall story is surprisingly solid.Last comments about the actors. I think they deserve a lot of credit, including the younger actors doing a phenomenal job considering they don't have an abundance of experience, they are not overacting and overall the acting and dialogues are solid. Brianne Howey is looking great in this teenage-appropriate movie.
This movie should be a great (if not a must) watch for anybody with a scientific bone in his/her body. Exact score: 78 / 100",Time Trap
103,terrencepatrix,"Liked it, would even like to see a sequel.",6,2 May 2018,"More than an adequate sci-fi mystery thriller right here. The plot is quite simple but there are definitely some unexpected twists throughout this movie and an ending I didn't see coming. A professor is going off in search of an area that both his parents and his sister disappeared in decades ago only to go missing himself. A few of his students along with a sibling and a friend take it upon themselves to go in search of him and find themselves trapped within a cave with some mysterious properties. They soon discover that time passes much slower inside than outside and that years have passed on the outside. I can't say anymore without spoilers, but you probably won't see it coming. This movie has a moderate budget and uses special FX sparingly, but when they do they're done well, and the set is put together quite well. The acting is mostly adequate, not spectacular, and some of the dialogue is delivered in a clunky way. One of the leading female actors is actually pretty annoying throughout much of it, screaming out her lines, but I'm not sure if it's due to the actress, the writing, or the direction. It's forgivable though. I found it to be an enjoyable and easy to watch sci-fi flick. Recommended for sci-fi fans with moderate expectations.",Time Trap

The story was reasonable and there were some big opening on how things happened or why they happened. There were multiple cave entrances as if that was somehow critical to the plot.. but it wasn't (it would have been more interesting if that HAD been the case).
The story was okay and the ending was better than many low-budget movies (that simply ""end""). The stand out is Cassidy Griffin who is not only a decent actress, but she's very pretty. Nice to see good talent in a low budget movie. A few of the other actors (in lesser roles) were not very talented.

Granted that any seed of greatness must be carried to fruition by the viewers imagination as; the abundance of stupidity, imbedded in all the characters, is instantaneous in quashing any quality attempting to show its presence.If you have a craving for a typical B-film this may well meet your needs - it's bad, but in an enjoyable way.

It clearly has a natural bell curve for what it is, even granting the 10/10 excess the rating isn't overly weighted, maybe a 5.5. Why some expect more from a million dollar film is beyond me.It's a light Sci-Fi fantasy movie based on the fountain of youth with a modern interpretation. People who bemoan the accuracy of the physics seem to think we understand how time works and the films doing it wrong, they clearly have no idea about how theories work or that time is a human construct, just ask Einstein. There are plot-holes and writer contrivances, but I'm willing to let them go by and imagine what if...Anyway the movie is a solid 5 or a possible 6, so six it is, just to further upset the 1 out of 10 drones. I've seen worse films with tens of millions of dollars thrown at them and they are far worse than this offering.

Good enough for me really.This is an adventure story that turns into sci fi and i absolutely love it.

117,Her-Excellency,Light years beyond DUMB (+Wildly FAKE Ratings).,1,4 October 2019,"While there are parts of it that are entertaining (maybe entertaining makes it sound better than it is) or are just okay enough to keep your interest, as a whole, it is pretty terrible.The premise has been done before, repeatedly, and has been done much better. There are so many glaring holes in terms of the quantum mechanics of time travel, that if you are a mathematician (or have OCD about numbers) or if you're just really into time-travel flicks, the discrepancies will drive you crazy.
(Time goes slower in the cave and the world passes them by, but when one or two of them get out of the cave and then come back, for some reason time has not passed. Whaaat? Lol). The costumes (yes, costumes) are laughably bad (if you see it, you'll know which ones I am referring to), and although the acting isn't as bad as some of the worst-acted movies you and I have surely seen, it is still pretty bad. As if that wasn't enough, there are a couple of parts in particular that just make you shake your head in amazement at how ludicrous they are. One of them, and the reason for my spoiler tag, is that the group is RIGHT next to a plot device which will help a character, yet they don't think about using it? Oh, and as an afterthought, what purpose did having the dog in it at the beginning serve if it was not followed up on? Lastly, the ending? SO DUMB.All in all, there is no way that I could in good conscience recommend this movie to anyone I know even if just to pass the time, and I cannot fathom how anyone could.I GUARANTEE THE 8, 9, & 10 Reviews are all fake. THINK about it: 8, 9 10s should be reserved for the best of the best. What are the chances that a B movie about time-travel with zero to no buzz is that type of film?

Oh, did we mention that going into the cave results in time dilation? That too.It is an attractive mess of attractive people, some good car dialog to get things to a level of believability, and some real enthusiasm and some effects done inexpensively but well.If you like your indie sci-fi done with enthusiasm and good looking cast, dive right in there. There are more enthusiastic ratings among the reviewers and I believe they are sincere - just not critical. I like my plots a little tighter. Hell, I like plots to be a LOT tighter. And I don't understand why an abandoned VW bus is found fresh and brightly colored when a similarly abandoned pickup somewhat later in the movie is found full of unconvincingly applied overgrowth.The folks behind the movie tried hard, but they bit off a lot more plot than they could work with. Ultimately they called it good and had everyone wake up in a different place at the end.I would like to think the writers and directors and producers will learn from this and go on to greater things. Maybe even more movies. This is beginner material, contrived but effort is visible.",Time Trap
121,connorundrumme,"This was an earnest attempt that was mostly successful, but...",7,15 February 2020,"While it certainly has some interesting ideas and effects, it does become kind of an unresolved and confused jumble in this form. It'd probably have been a better idea to sell it to someone/seek money to develop a quality tv series with more focus on storytelling, and any character development whatsoever. Contrary to some other reviewers, I've seen many of the devices used in this production in both SciFi tv and movies, but it didn't make this any kind of failure, so who cares, really?The casting was more about looks than talent, for the most part. The acting is wooden at times, or too cutesy, or sassy, or whiny, or shrieky, etc., so the direction must have been uhm, challenging for both sides. Some of the pointless and atrocious dialogue included a teen responding to her sister's concern and correction by saying, ""You're so weird."", then getting reinforced by another adult character who then says, ""They're so boring."" Ugh.Didn't understand why multiple reviews were mentioning the 'Goonies', until it was said by one of the actors very early on. It has nothing to do with this movie, it's that people are suggestible and hijack a thought/word when there's nothing else relevant to say in a review. It has one juvenile male that can't stop making creepy sexually harassing come-on remarks, which doesn't liken it to another adventure movie for juveniles at all.Then theres a woman climbing rock walls in high-cut jean shorts?! Theres using guns on cave dwellers, who have dark skin for no particular reason, since they've been stuck living without sun for who knows how long, eating who knows what... bullets or guns, maybe? (Makes sense they're so aggressive.) I was waiting for Chaka from Land of the Lost to show up to rescue everyone.",Time Trap
122,rklemm05,Off to a good start but then...,3,1 October 2018,"It was not a bad movie to begin with. Like a mash-up between The Goonies, Stranger things and some unabashed 80's movie. The plot wasn't exceptional but ok, enjoyable.
Then, at some point, you don't know what came into the writers' minds, they thought it would be a good idea to add some cavemen fighting with a Robocop (yeah,who thought these two words could fit in the same sentence?), in such in a ridiculous way too, almost looks like a prank.
In a nutshell, they ruined the movie, and you start to regret having given it a chance and wasted your time.

123,damorejj,The 5 stars are for concept only,5,15 December 2019,"I'm a tremendous fan of sci-fi, and I don't believe a large budget is necessary to make a great sci-fi film. All that is required is a very unique concept, as little plot holes as possible, great acting and a solid script. This movie has one of those, and it's not the acting.
I think this movie has an amazing concept, and even with the acting which at times isn't that bad, the movie was executed horribly.
This movie could've been so much better had it been done correctly. First mistake was using teenagers and kids instead of people who actually know a bit about archeology and spelunking. The script was just horrendous.
The movie had some promise though so I kept with it. The part when one of the girls exits the cave to see that the world is basically in ruin and returns to the cave only to find them waiting is a major plot hole. Outside the cave time is moving differently, this has been established. She should've been left alone to die. The movie got much worse after that.
The moment spaceman shows up with his magical ladder the movie literally dove into stupidity. Then the cave men and the healing fountain and the professor who is found alive, but stabbed, knows there's a pool that can cure him about 50 feet away but he's about to give up on life....can it get any dumber than that?!?
The ending was simply abysmal writing. This movie had great promise, it really did. So I'm giving it 5 stars for that promise, but that's all. This movie got really bad really fast, faster than those years were passing in the sky.",Time Trap

The rumor of youth fountain has been circulated along the generations, and a group of young explorers, whose intention was to complete their homework, got accidentally trapped in the cave. Soon they came to the shocking revelation that within the cave time passed extremely slow as compared to the world outside. The way with which the story panned out is very well designed, and for an independent movie, this one is of quite high standard.",Time Trap
135,Kaygee906,"It's different, but good",9,12 December 2019,"To summarize the film, it's basically about a group of teens/twenty somethings who try to find their professor after he disappeared while exploring a cave. As the title suggests, there is a time trap and the film depicts their adventure as they figure out where they are and how to get out of the time trap.Watch the film with no expectations and an open mind & you'll be pleasantly surprised. It's sort of like back to the future meets tomb raider (without the mummies), and some other films that I can't say otherwise it'd ruin the suspense.This movie is different than anything I've ever seen and I think it was a solid film. It kept our attention the whole time and time just seemed to fly by. Pun intended. It definitely has several plot twists and it kept us guessing and we had no idea what to expect. This film was far from predictable, which I think is a hard task to accomplish in this genre.I don't think the cast was terrible. I don't think the acting was terrible. I don't think the set/budget was terrible. I don't think it was a train wreck & I don't think people are being paid to write reviews (am I naive or does that actually happen?). I really don't understand why people are ripping on this movie so badly. No, it's not a marvel or disney film with an unlimited budget, but it's not cheesy and it tells an entertaining story.

137,warren-87235,One of the most inventive little scifi movies I've seen in years,9,8 June 2020,"I had zero expectations going into this. The premise sounded interesting, and it popped up on Netflix, so I thought I would give it a go. The beginning is a little uneven in terms of character motivations and reasons for being in the circumstances in which they find themselves (hence knocking one star off). However, once things get going this turns into one of the more fun and inventive small-scale scifi movies I've seen in recent years.Honestly, I'd sooner sit down and watch this again (even after having only recently seen it) than re-watch most of the regurgitated Marvel movies. They're one-watch, turn-your-brain-off eye candy. This is actually fairly original (as much as you can be these days), creative and fun.IMDB states an estimated budget of 1 million - in all honesty, that makes this even more impressive, given that most 'low' budget films these days cost considerably more. Even the effects are pretty damn good. Just on the right level to serve the story, without making it feel low budget.For the most part, the characters aren't exactly original, but they also manage to avoid being too annoying (a rare thing these days!). There is one exception... Furby! Who goes from being an annoying character, to the best!I think one of the reasons I enjoyed this so much, is that it also has the atmosphere of a lot of the Golden Age scifi I used to read growing up. Where ideas and adventure trump the bland polish and visual excess of most blockbusters.Here's hoping it gets a proper BluRay release with special features! I'm looking forward to what the writer comes up with next.",Time Trap

So of course their performance was hit and miss, but I blame that mostly on the writer, director, and editor. The production value was very much low budget B minus movie level, but the production team actually did a pretty good job with what they had.All in all, I watched the whole thing, as painful as it was to do so. What can I say, I'm a sucker for science fiction and time travel movies.Time Trap really is a good plot concept but a poorly written middle-school level screenplay with maybe 9th-grade level directing. I'm giving it 4.42 stars and rounding up for the effort. It doesn't take itself too seriously, and there are even a few moments when you chuckle WITH the movie, but mostly you chuckle AT it.

This movie was a missed opportunity. If they would have just stuck with the initial guy and follow his story alone without involving this 4/5 useless characters, the movie would have been 10 stars. This show how bad writing and acting destroy a great premises of an amazing concept. What's worse is that the visuals are actually well made and there was a lot that could have been developed.It's fun to watch once, if you can swallow the stupid american dialog with zero humor in it.

Worth a watch for time-travel/sci-fi fans. Better than a lot of films with 10, 20 or even 30 times the budget.Most low budget sci-fi is a horrible mix of dreadful acting, poor effects and concepts that demand budgets multiple times higher than is available, which equals an awful final product.But this one is a really solid low budget, high concept film and a really effective use of limited resources and the acting is respectable.It gets a 7/10 from me.",Time Trap

The subject appealed to me especially the title since I usually like anything related to time but I wasn't prepared for how much I would enjoy this precious little jewel of a movie.It starts innocently enough and took a little while to get going but once it did I was totally hooked. The acting is good for this type of flick but the star of this movie is not really the characters so to speak but rather the way the story slowly grabs your attention and never lets the momentum die.The effects are very good and used sporadically enough to give us a satisfying jolt while not overdoing it and I was totally engrossed in how this would play out. There are a lot of great ideas flawlessly executed and the direction and editing are top notch serving us a fresh and moving story.Even the ending was wonderful, open enough to let a sequel continue this saga and frankly, I would love to see it. Not everything is explained but enough is resolved that we don't feel cheated yet I was totally rooting for the characters all the way through and the conclusion feels like the start of what could be a very exciting part 2.I give this 9 stars which is very well deserved and it's always such a great gift to be surprised by a movie that I wasn't sure would deliver.

Just lots of unique conditions & conclusions before the realization of the impact is discovered. I enjoyed being at the same pace as the characters when they are doing something the one thing only the most 'bored with outside' types can handle; cave climbing/ diving..?.🙄haha (I saw the scariest film in 2010 maybe, called the Descent about all woman caving) ..but this is also making the pursuit of exploring caves seem more mainstream so it could just be MY discomfort with HOLES in the wet cold hard ground. It does allow for a fun new spin on the whole time continuum idea & if perhaps some spot in the world was also connected to a future we have yet to exist in. Well with that I will stop! LOL JUST enjoy this fun movie. I found it great just wish we COULD have had more to see & a bigger budget to show more of what is described but in Hollywood they will just make it again with bigger stars & more CGI..so for now this film stands well on its own.

It seems that quite a bit of the population has been so dumbed down in recent times, (Public Education?) folks don't recognize crap when they see it. The dialogue in this film is idiotic.

Felt like a tale from Ray Bradbury with some teen action done good.
About those bad reviews from people that did not understand the movie or said it was without rhyme or reason, they probably don't read much about time bending theories, thus they really won't understand the movie concepts. This is a great movie and a living proof that one don't need fancy expensive fx to make a good flick.

157,Sumpmonster,A Nice Surprise,8,20 September 2019,"Time Trap is a fairly low budget movie that seems to be going nowhere,when all of a sudden a storyline and plot develop out of nothing. It seems as though the wannabe rescuers have fallen into the same cyclical trap as their college professor, when odd things begin to happen. It might appear slow and ponderous, but it is a genuinely slow paced build-up which reaches a well thought out, if fanciful conclusion. It's not entirely original, but compared to some of the time travel guff that's out there it resolves things reasonably well without having to rely on ""blips"" that don't actually explain anything or make any sense.

Saw it almost it the fast forward most of the time since the acting is so poor i was only curious to see where the story would go. In fact, if only it would have better acting, and it was cut in half the time, I could even consider this as a poor but nevertheless entertaining movie . Unfortunately the scenes are long and with unnecessary dialogues and shots of the actors poorly executed surprise or shock expressions... unfortunately the acting is so bad that I could not care less of what they where saying. The end of the movie although tried to surprise a bit , ended exactly how you would expect and all the explanations about what happened are left to our own imagination. Some CGI effects are not enough to save the movie because all the scenarios on the cave are so awfully made that you are never engaged with the movie and nothing, really nothing feels credible.

Also they had good special effects in it as well. We don't get all our answers but I'll give it a shot.So the students go after their teacher, who unfortunately didn't just tell them to wait outside the cave for him incase anything happened. The reason for this is pretty good, he's on land that's got no trespassing signs up. So instead of risking everyone getting arrested he goes alone. We also know later he's really looking for his parents who went looking for the fountain of youth. Now as the movie goes on we realize the characters will never get back to their own time, it's just impossible. They also accept that whatever happens they want out of the cave itself as it's really become a timetrap! We never find out why the cave was there, who made it, was it natural? My guess is it's natural and just there, but there are some issues with this theory. It never gets weaker or anything during the time the earth changes, this makes me think it's somehow generated by tech somewhere in the planet, perhaps pre-human civilization. We're also introduced to someone from the future who just wants the water from the cave, he saves them partly before dying because a caveman pulls his mask off. They knock the caveman out and offer to put his mask back on but it never happens. I am going to say the reason he didn't put it on is he was already exposed to the atmosphere and that meant certain death. They also didn't put him in the water for some reason, god knows why. But even so they escape but it's the future, far beyond now or then. It's hyperdrive to Mars. So the cool part is we know humans of the future are using the water from the pool, or they've created their own because we have 2 pools that revive everyone. It's unclear whether they made this tech or it's only available on Earth, perhaps that's a reason for the spacestation still being there.Over-all this was very well done, everything about it. I can hardly believe I haven't seen it till now. Thanks!",Time Trap

At first I was ready to turn it off, later I was interested.

At this point they coulda just considered firing them and replacing them with some bums laying around on the street corner.

It suddenly became a lot more than that, as what seemed like a formulaic cast of kids and daytime soap-star leads became real and interesting characters - and what promised to be a committee-driven, undemanding science-fantasy became an intriguing and rather well thought-out story.

But the plot kept us moving, and guessing, and I thought it payed off perfectly. Also, while the acting was uneven, I've seen MUCH worse in similarly-budgeted films. Both Andrew Wilson and Brianne Howey particularly stood out. The cave men... Not so much.

189,tandeki,Strange but somehow entertaining,6,20 February 2020,"Considering the cost of a movie like ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" which had 60 times the costs of ""Time Trap"", you have to applaud the makers for this achievment. But looking seperately at ""Time Trap"", is it still a good movie? Yes and no. It is entertaining, although it has a very slow start. And most of the special effects are quite good. Even the actors do their best, although you can see that they are still very unexperienced. So it is basically an entertaining movie and that is what I mostly expect from spending my time on it. But the plot is not as clever as some reviews might suggest. For experienced science fiction nerds, the plot is even very basic and quite the oppostive of innovative. Furthermore, the whole idea of the movie is shattered by some very crucial logic errors. And for me it is the worst thing when a fictional world contradicts its own rules. So if you can overlook the strange things in this movie, you can have a good time. But if you tend to have a critical look on movies like this, better stay away.",Time Trap

191,joe12361,Had to comment on this beauty of a film,9,1 August 2019,"I feel compelled to offer a few thoughts on this interesting, thought-provoking and inspiring film. First of all, I think the take-away message such as there is one, is that right now, and probably for the last 6,000 years, we are in humanity's golden period. A time when civilisation has flourished. That is, at least if we buy into the accepted narrative and paradigm of the world that we are fed on a daily basis, and reinforced by parents, teachers, companies, the (mainstream) media, and practically every other institution or edifice erected to conventional wisdom, religion, science and technology. This is the message the film is sending; in other words - the best time is now. This I can agree with, but not because of the conventional paradigm, in fact despite it. I remember a very wise 'religious' teacher at school who was always at pains to point out that no matter how far back in time you went, be it 200,000 years, or 2 million years; humans have always been fundamentally the same (We didn't learn much religion in his classes, but we got a fantastic philosophical schooling from his musings though). The same biology, the same intellectual capacity, the same potential and propensity for good and evil; identical. As adults today, we have been fed a spiritually stunting and corrosive narrative our entire lives; the process of brainwashing and indoctrination continues to this day, and begins from the moment we exit the womb; its pace unabated and even perhaps quickened in attempting to smother and snuff out the better instincts of children such as curiosity, inquisitiveness and playfulness; as perhaps for most (but not all) adults, they were snuffed out in us; as we began our indoctrination programmes from a young age, teaching us in the ways of conformism, and preparing us for our rosy future as well-adjusted consumerists. Luckily for humanity though, among its number there are always the eccentrics, so-called lunatics, maniacs, weirdos, freaks, etc, etc; call them what you will. We all know who I'm talking about though, people who don't buy the corporate, materialist BS, which is becoming ever more pervasive and in-your-face on an almost daily basis. These are basically the last hope of humanity. What a majority of these 'fringe' people have in spades however is great spirit; and along with that an ability to see a person for their true worth, and not see a suit, or some 'academic' accomplishments, or some 'sporting' achievements; or whatever else people value these days; perhaps a successful 'career', whatever the hell that is.
Anyway, not to sidetrack, and to try and keep things positive, hard though that may be. Reading between the lines of the film; and taking the accepted narrative and conventional wisdom for what it is; entirely as it's presented to us, and at face value; (despite it being patently absurd, ludicrous and nonsensical); then let us humour our higher natures and pretend for a moment we were ever grunting troglodytes such as those portrayed in the film, or perhaps might become eight foot tall asthmatic and anaemic slender-men descended from 'Space', at some point in the future; it's message is that we are at the perfect stage of 'evolution' right now. This I can agree on with the producers and writers of this film. The reason for this however, is not because humans have had a linear progression from guttural cave-dwelling neanderthal trolls to our present state; nor because we have some far-flung destiny as eight foot tall martians. It is simply that while humans always have, and always will remain the same, in possession of certain mental, emotional, physical, and above all spiritual (though you'd be hard pushed to find evidence of the latter one in today's world) faculties and capacities, which are invariant and unchanging - i.e. conserved among lineage; in the infancy of our existence as a species, we lacked the tools and language necessary for very great communication, organisation and self-assembly into complex social groups and wider, productive and gainful societies. That is not so say that at any point however, we lacked the potential, or capability to ever do these things; which we have always had in abundance. Life is less brutal today; but the lessons and zeitgeists of our past existences still leave their formidable imprint on the human psyche and our collective consciousness - and indeed individual conscience - is inescapable from them. If we are to undergo an epoch-making paradigm shift and elevation of our consciousness and state of being away from the radical positions of being either too primitive, or too technologically advanced, which are the two ultra-extremes this film portrays very effectively; then we will have to drop the conceit, arrogance, egoism and pretentiousness, as well as the self-deceit, vanity and pride which the world is suffering from now as it never has done before, in order to herald the positive change we are all truly seeking, if we were brutally honest with ourselves, and our loyalties were not so cleaved by and divided among the corporate morass and cesspit of materialism, which we currently find pervading and dominating our existence. But never fear, to mishmash some great Black soul and motown songs, 'Tomorrow's going to be a bright, bright, sunshiny day; but we'll even have sunshine on a cloudy day; when we can all just sit on the dock of a bay, watching the tide roll away'. It's the sentiments contained in these songs and countless others; representing qualities that are indefinable, indescribable, inscrutable, and above all timeless; which represents the real and true hope for all our future selves, and not some fantastical technological or materialist dream.",Time Trap

An original idea (finally!), with a confident execution. The dialogue and acting could be better (though the acting was generally ok), and some of the characters' actions don't make a lot of sense, but these are forgivable since such minor flaws are swept along by the energy of the film. I also empathised with the characters a bit --for example when something happened to one of them, I genuinely felt ""No, this can't be!"" The ending is unexpected and epic in scope, though the dialogue here is perhaps a bit cringeworthy. And though the idea of the ""original"" inhabitants of the cave is cool, their execution (actors, makeup and costume) leaves a lot to be desired -- though I can turn a blind eye considering the low budget.For all it's faults, I agree with the other reviewers who say that this is a solid time-themed science fiction film that's well worth a watch.",Time Trap

Then a character climbs out, and we discover something different happening. After drifting between genres, horror or sci-fi, it finally lands on an ending. And while its mixture of genres is interesting, it's fairly middling at both. For horror fans looking forward to a high body count, the ending could be a letdown.

There are no paradoxes, like in 'Predestination' or 'Dark', and there is lack of the more 'straightforward' time travel theme like in 'Timeless'. The movie presents a totally different concept; like Wells' 'The Time Machine', it delves into the whole 'deep time' concept and it does it pretty well.

Budget is low but it is not a low budget movie, it's what you call a chamber piece in theater, everything in it is professionally executed with proper actors it just does not attempt to create something grand in terms of the visuals but the limited number of visual effects that do fit into the budget are perfect.

Those who gave it low points must be from some competition or hold a grudge of some kind",10,9 November 2019,"For me this is close to a 10, this was an amazing ride. And my 10 isn't because I am factoring in the low budget, this is an almost 10 at any budget. Superb acting, great suspense, very good CGI topping of a superb story. The Story and acting performance pulled it up from the 8.5 I otherwise would have given it because it is a bit slow moving at times. See, I several times was tempted to jump ahead a bit, that dragged it down a tad, yet the story and the acting where 10+ so, it's a 9.6 or so, meaning 10, since I can't give half points.I won't tell you much about the story, you need to see it for yourself, saying anything would destroy the movie for you. What I can say is that it wasn't the usual hollywood predictable sci-fi story, it takes you by surprise, many times, especially last part. Personally, I so much hope they make a Time Trap 2 soon, if they do, I will most certainly be watching it. See the ending was great, yet also a bit of a cliffhanger.To the team, please make a follow up movie, this time, please speed the story up just a bit, 10 % or so is enough.

On the contrary, I think these folks are trolls, intentionally lowering the film's ratings, for whatever reason. I found it very enjoyable myself. I am not affiliated with this or any other film .. I am just a lover of movies and time travel.For a limited budget movie I was quite impressed by how good the cinematography and special effects are. It's beautifully filmed and edited, and although special effects are done sparingly, when they are used they are perfect. The film is not cheesy or disjointed. It appears that every aspect was well thought out and executed. As for the acting, I would say that the actors range from good to meh, depending on the actor.The story is not going to win an Oscar, but it's fresh and entertaining. This is a different take on time travel, and there were some unexpected twists to the concept. And although it's kind of slow moving (no pun intended) I was never bored. I wanted to see what became of the characters .. and the world outside the cave.My only disappointment is that where the ending started off great, it finished too soon.

But if you can forgive it that then it is a fun B movie that is a great way to put the brain in neutral and enjoy the ride.
The story itself is kind of cliche,and the characters themselves never really get developed beyond what you need to know...
But beyond that it is an enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours.
The young actors may not be destined for Oscars,but they all do a very adequate job.
There are several plot holes that could do your head in if you think about them too much...but if you do that then this movie is not for you.

Like the title of this review said, I didn't expect much. The last few low budget movie I've seen about time travel were very disappointing because of bad acting, script who wants to be more clever than their writer or just plainly bad.
The story is simple enough but most of the time you don't know what will happen next. It's start slowly and almost cliché with a bunch of teenagers who decide to explore a cave (don't you watch the news people ?! :-) and then things start happening that I didn't expect. 
It's not easy to find a good, entertaining low budget sci-fi movie with a good enough cast and special effects, so kudos to everyone involve.

The dialogue is brain-dead stupid and the characters spend almost the entire length of the movie trying to figure out what the audience knows in the first 2 minutes of the movie. They bicker with one another saying a ridiculous amount of ""dudes"" in the dialogue while failing to figure out what any person of below average intelligence could have within seconds. There is basically 2 interesting parts in the movie one of which is the ending but it is not very unique or clever enough to make watching the first hour of it worth it.If anything they should have started with the ending of the movie and told that story instead. To sum it up it's basically a B-rated teen movie but on the lower end of that spectrum. There's nothing to be gained by watching it in neither entertainment nor artistic value.",Time Trap

252,recca01982,It's hit and/or miss tbh....,5,3 April 2020,"Okay,.... I've seen TONS of B-movies these past few weeks. While this is definitely a b-movie,... it's not nearly as bad as people are making it out to be. Is it mindless and semi-cliche? Of course,... it's a b-movie!I don't know why people are expecting something AAA from b-movies,... this movie DEFINITELY didn't deserve the amount of 1 stars,.... but in the same form that it DEFINITELY doesn't deserve the 10's. Everyone has their opinions,... but for me neither are right. 5 is a good stand point.Plot - Fountain of youth in design of a cave system that stops all time for it's inhabitants, while the outside moves forward at a super accelerated pace. Sounds interesting,... but it was rarely touched upon in terms of potential. It was more of a focus point for why they were seeing random cave men, and toward the end, randomly soldiers from a war. If that time trap was slowly moving like they suggested,... why was there a bullet behind the cavemen chasing his sister who ran into said time trap... It just doesn't add up to the way they want it to. So some small plot holes,... but time ""travel"" this movie is not. This is more time stagnation, so it really doesn't belong to the same rules/rhyme as most time travel movies (Back to The Future for example,... completely different ball game).Acting - While not bad,... the actors felt like they weren't of the best sort. But they were chosen because they were the best of those who showed up. They had an old school power rangers feel to their acting. Cheesy, but still entertaining at times. The professor was a bit wonky and felt like he smoked a bit of his mother's stash before giving his lines :/Visuals - For a b-movie? Not that bad tbh. Maybe like 6/10. I've seen some pretty bad CG's in this genre, but these were tolerable.Overall - Worth the money I didn't spend on a movie ticket. Watching on Netflix, I felt it was a worthwhile time trap,.... so to speak. If you just enjoy the movie for what it is,... and not what it should be. You should have a decent time.Ending - Although,.... I do wish they expanded on why the teenagers were so popular,.... they were just kids who went missing. As far as we know, nothing ever came of this. It was never because of their finding the fountain of youth, as hundreds/thousands of years had past,... so who would remember them. Just a rather Disney happy ending :/",Time Trap

It sounds similar to Netflix's Dark, but not as convoluted and complex.Definitely a fun movie to watch and to ponder over afterwards - not something to just dump from your brain after viewing.",Time Trap
282,christophercfox,Make Time for Time Trap,8,6 December 2019,"So this movie is an example of how an interesting concept and a few actors can now make a decent movie. It won't compete with the latest Avengers movie but it is better than many of the generic sci fi movies we wade through on Netflix. The basic plot involves the ""fountain of youth"", parents trying to save their young child, people looking for missing people, and how you would deal with a situation where your basic understanding of time is changed. I liked the actors - there are some funny quick hit lines that are delivered without distracting from the plot, the characters are confused without being stupid, and the few visual special effects are well done. If you are looking to spend a few hours watching TV and don't want to watch a rerun - give this a shot.",Time Trap

After watching the trailer I figured I had it worked out, however there are some small twists that expand and hold your attention. All in all, for a teens and 20s mostly cast they did well and the production value was on par for higher budget films.

But when it is one after another of stupid kids or teens, heading straight into doing stupid thing after stupid thing. And asking stupid question after stupid question.

As for the movie: the concept is great, the movie starts fine but then it hits the wall of amateur acting, unbelievable characters and poor script.Sell the rights for the movie to some Hollywood producer and all this might still end with a happy ending; you'll get the money and the viewers will get a proffesional remake.But still a great concept.",Time Trap

Don't want to say to much as to not spoil the movie for people.
However, what I can say is that the idea and main story is really good and a novel turn on things that have been done in the past.
Basically time runs a lot slower in the cave than outside.
What spoils this is how the characters react to this and the unusual events that occur because of this.
Some of what they do is border line stupid to ridiculous.
That said I sort of enjoyed the movie and am glad I watched it, but it has left me with a little frustration that with a bit of thought and more effort in the screenplay, this could have been a really excellent movie.
Special effects where sufficient and matched up to those seen in some of the higher budgets out there.

That said, the concept was intriguing enough to keep me from clicking 'back to browse'.

312,MajorMAlice,One of the Best (or Worst) cases of Rating Manipulations,1,21 October 2019,"This movie is as bad as any B-Movie can be. The making, the packaging and the marketing is, collectively, the first cardinal sin everyone involved with it commits. It is quite truly, a movie so harebrained in its conception and inept in its execution that upon viewing, a person practically has to wonder if it was real or imagined and then pray it was imagined and that you did not actually spend two hours of your life (any life) on the incredibly badly acted and directed, terribly-written, snorefest plot that this movie offers.The second, unpardonable sin, the creators (and I suspect pretty much everyone related with the movie) commit, is the blatant ratings manipulation that is going on with it. For this movie to have ANY 10a at all, it would have to go backwards in time and be the first movie ever put to film and even then, it would be doubtful it would receive more than a 6, which is still way too high for thing inadequate pile of brain-dumbing, sleep-inducing junk. The case that it actually does have numerous 10s can only be explained by the crew recognizing early on that it is a complete joke, but running with it anyway in the hopes of recouping their losses.Fall for it if you would like, but go there knowing that at least you have been warned. It is honestly not good enough to watch even if free, much less if you have to rent it.",Time Trap
313,edmc499,Good story idea and good effects for the budget,6,23 April 2020,This film has a good story idea which led to some great moments sprinkled through out but unfortunately those moments are sometimes ruined by the bad acting and bad script writing. I also I believe this film shouldn't really be in the Action genre as there isn't really much action in here at all it's more a Sci-fi Adventure. If you are just looking for a film to past the time and forget about the next day this is it. For the budget though this film is pretty good and the story idea is something new and could been explored more.,Time Trap
314,smithiealan,"Excellent concept, and well worth viewing.",7,28 April 2020,"A truly clever idea, quite novel, and a story idea which has an audience. Though a low budget it was cleverly executed given the obvious budgetary restraints.The underlying theme addresses deep rooted longing for immortality, resurrection, control over helplessness, even hope. The theme is enveloped in a time travel story that is quite clever as well as being entertaining, though the storyline does become convoluted at times.The script dialogue possibly adversely affected the actors performances which at times were unconvincing, Also I feel that the dialogue of one character sounded similar to the others which diminished associating and rooting for a character. However, the entertainment and tension hold my attention, and I watched to the end, and clearly many others did as well. This film certainly has an audience.The journey from the ordinary world into the surreal world was well set up, and the insidious revelation of their plight well placed. This caused me to want to ""warn"" the protagonists ""not to do this, or that,"" which induced some empathy for the characters.The transformation into the ""time trap"" was akin to slow journey into a dream, or rather a nightmare into an imaginary world where time flits irretrievably by. Given this, at a point their plight seemed hopeless, which worked very well and had me questioning ""where is this going?""

This is one of those relative few that really leave you wanting more! Sure, 'time travel' as a sci-fi vehicle has been done to death, but it's one of those 'vehicles' that is eminently upgradable with the 'write' amount of 'scriptgenuity' and novel use of the genre. 
 Time Trap is just unique enough in it's approach and just slick enough in it's presentation to really set the hook, and leave you 'trapped' for a moment in time at the end, wondering at all the possibilities for a sequel, or even a series. 
 As largely a character driven piece, I did not feel slighted in the slightest (see what I did there?) at the use of unknown actors, as they really sold the plot well, and evoked enough empathy from me to be excited about the outcome. 
 Would I watch it again? You know, I think I will, and soon....the only disappointment going forward, is the near certainty that this thought provoking foray into the future won't spawn a sequel or series.",Time Trap

In the beginning it had horror movie vibes and then it turned into a weird off brand science fiction film? I wish it would have just stayed with one genre honestly because it didn't do either well enough. And the eerie, suspenseful scenes that randomly popped up in the story were huge let downs because didn't build up to anything!Also, I know that everything in this film was fictional but in my opinion too many different unbelievable things occurred within the storyline. Like you have the cave system in which time moves so slowly that it's basically frozen in time, then you have the cave water that is not only the source of the time slowing but is also a healing pool that can literally revive people from death. Then you also have cave people from thousands of years ago and aliens from the distant future all interacting with people from our time simultaneously. And at the end you have the main characters taken up by aliens who are hundreds of thousands of years removed from our civilization just to make them celebrities???In the end I didn't care about what happened to any of the characters because they were all so dumb, the acting was so poor, and because none of the deaths were truly permanent!

It's not very smart and the low budget really shows, especially with makeup - but the story itself is fun and it's just a movie to enjoy if you are into sci-fi like me. The actors do decent jobs and (most) characters are charismatic with some great moments, but still - it's supposed to be silly, at the limit, but it does have fun with its own silliness. I enjoyed it! What made me write this review is that it's been a while since a silly movie made me actually finish it satisfied.

331,yoshinaruto,"Great ideas, pretty bad execution.",4,30 August 2021,"Whether or not I'd recommend this depends on how much you care about quality vs entertainment.For the good, there's a lot of great concepts here. The pacing was decent, and kept me engaged once they reached the cave. I wasn't bored at any point, and I was curious as to what was planned.As far as overall quality, it varies greatly. The CGI is decent considering this is low budget Sci-Fi, I can't really complain here. The directing is more or less okay. For the most part there's nothing impressive, nor are there any shots that are distractingly bad.Then we get to what is distracting. The acting is mediocre at best. If you have a high tolerance for bad acting, you won't mind, but most B-Horror movies have better acting than this. The kids aren't the worst I've seen though all things considered.The dialogue is probably the worst thing about this film. The writing as a whole isn't very good in general. The audience will discover a twist, the characters will make a terrible excuse for why it isn't so, then ten minutes later realize what's going on and try to explain it to the audience by saying the most obvious things. Most of the dialogue is oddly robotic with characters saying things just to fill space in the movie. Sometimes you don't need a character to speak as something is happening. Having them ask the same question over and over when there obviously isn't an answer yet doesn't help either. It's quite baffling with how intriguing the film is that more care wasn't put into making the dialogue at least tolerable. Not to mention I'm pretty confident there's definitely a plot hole that's glossed over involving the professor, but I won't get into that, for the sake of not spoiling as well as the fact that it doesn't bother me as much as the rest of the writing.The start isn't particularly interesting, but I more or less liked the ending. It's just a shame that this didn't get a few rewrites and some better actors. I could easily see myself giving this an 8/10 if it were done better, but if you're looking for a good low budget cerebral Sci-Fi film you're better off watching something like Coherence or Primer.If you're a big fan of Sci-Fi, the premise interests you, and you don't mind below average acting and writing, this is pretty watchable. If you're not fully into Sci-Fi, or you can't stand mediocre acting and writing, I'd probably say skip it. Personally, I want someone to take the best ideas from this and remake it into something better, as it has a lot of potential.",Time Trap

For the most part the acting was decent and the best actors seem to have smaller roles, Olivia Draguicevich who played Veeves a 13 yr old who exuded the confidence of a mature adult. Olivia delivered a nice performance. Max Wright was spectacular as Furby and I wish his character was featured more in this movie, because it would have brightened some of the less finer moments in this movie when you thought it might get bogged down by a weak script that created some unrealistic reactions to what was happening at that moment. I can't say more without being a ""spoiler"" so I will just say that I liked this one a lot. I liked the fresh and unique approach to this Sci-Fi genre. The FX was exceptional for a movie of such a low budget. Definitely worth watching.",Time Trap

At one point the characters start talking (nonsense, by the way) and they neeeever stop. They take so long to wrap their heads around what is happening that even I felt like time was slowing down and this movie lasted forever. By the time cool stuff is starting to happen, you don't really care anymore. That's a shame because if you take away 70 minutes of lame and annoying conversation, you end up with about 20 minutes of okay movie. This movie gets a 10/10 for creativity but a 0/10 for execution.

Here, however, one has implemented the division ""time compression"" of the temporal doctrine very well.

It's just awfull, so much potential wasted.Some revelations where epic, like the girl (I don't even remember their names) climbing up only finding a barren world and discovering the space station. Or the still shot where you see some kind of battle for this fountain of youth. or when they discover that it's not days going by, but seisons. However, this is not conveyed at all by the characters. It seems they were casted for some student project. There is no drama at all. It is just acted so bad.The ending is just a blatant mind trick. Oh yeah, they are in the future on this space ship and are launched to Mars, or whatever, leaving this strange cave behind. No conversations, no urge to have some answers what the heck happened. No trauma they just lost their entire lives, oh well, it is fun up here in the year 4000 or whatever. Why would these aliens save them, whats the point? The ending felt like a cheap TV show, needing a sequel. The teacher finds his family.And oh: Let's just leave the cave people behind to die.The lighting and cinematography was also bad. No suspense at all. The music. Meh... I appreciate the orchestral score (made by digital fake instruments) but it just did not do the work properly. No suspense.

Every interesting action happens off-camera for at least the first two thirds of the runtime--and arguably all of it. They introduce a literal Chekhov's gun, but the character carrying said gun serves exactly no other purpose in the story. Internal logic is inconsistent even within the bounds established by the film. In a science-fiction movie, the (all-white) characters ask no questions, follow no arcs, and never actually confront their central problem, from which they are saved by a deus ex machina. Many reviews point to the actors, but I think the real issues are the direction and scripting.Still, it's an interesting concept that could be reworked into several interesting stories in the hands of someone who actually sought to tell those stories. A couple of well-staged shots near the end. Good use of lighting throughout, and the special effects are generally solid.

Sencondly, there are a lot of things that get looked over and ignored, no spoilers, but there is a special part in the cave where time is extra slow (at least I think it is) and it goes completely ingnored.
Another thing is the characters' personalities, one of the blond girls has this super annoying suprise face that looks like she's about to sneeze; the whole group of kids is just so annoying, this one random guy dies and instead of putting him in the magical healing water, they let him die...
Last thing, the hole is the best actor in the movie, the characters dont even act like humans most of the time! I didn't even care for the dog, and that is saying a lot for me.

I mean there are lots of time travel films out there just not that felt like this one. Engaging even with it's low budget.

402,sparklemagic,"Poor acting and script, very interesting concept",5,28 December 2018,"So the main characters spend much too much time talking to eachother surrounded by cave rocks. At about the 40 minute mark, you are thinking, when the heck is something interesting going to happen to these people?
If the dialog was interesting, philosophical or whatever, then that would be one thing. But its just idle banter to fill time. I think this should have been a half hour short film, but was instead teased out to a feature length. The end was very disappointing as well and its only purpose was to close out the characters.
The big reveal that happens part way through the film, I predicted as soon as they got into the caves, and it was very underwhelming and obvious. The characters were barely different from eachother, and had no real motivations. They often made decisions without any rhyme or reason.I would still recommend watching it and I gave it a 5 star rating, because of the extremely interesting concept of a time dilation cave complex. I am just disappointed it was not executed better, and am kind of mad now as no one else can make the same concept film, which would probably be acted and directed and shot much better.I cannot believe that this movie cost 3 million to make. It took place literally in one location that was probably a sound stage. This movie looks like it was made for less than 100k, so if you go into it with that expectation, its not too bad.",Time Trap

The concept if fairly fresh since I don't remember seeing a similar movie before so that's a big plus. The time travel mechanics seem logical at least from a layman's perspective, I'm sure some scientists would disagree. Would the film be even better with more talented actors and a higher budget? Sure, but that would be a 10/10 movie then, right now I give it an 8/10.",Time Trap

When I saw the lights flickering outside my pulse raced, pleased the director had thought that much about what was happening. Don't get me wrong, the film is floored big time, there are many weak spots, the cavemen, the 'future' guy, the cheesy ending but in my opinion I excuse them because the concept was excellent and exciting and some of the visuals were stunning.

I'm rating this a 7 simply because I saw it as a B-movie from the trailer but was absolutely sucked into the story.
Actors were pretty good, writing could have been slightly better but it's far from the worst I've come across.
Some saw the characters acted unbelievably, statements like ""why didn't they just"" are thrown about but honestly if you can't tell from the title it contains quite frankly unbelievable concepts that we all know don't exist, if you found yourself in their shoes and weren't having a panic attack then I would be very surprised. People act rashly or out of character in a car crash for example so not coping well or doing what they should have is to be expected.The ending let me down, it could of used a bit of a wind down and character resolutions",Time Trap

I wish it gave us more of an ending- but I also know that when movies do give us an ending, a lot of time we are like ""Wtf was that?""

Time machine concepts
Good storylineThe cons:
Low budget
Not great acting
Ending could have been betterWhen the first climber went to the top time went normal for her 15 to 20 min and for the people in the cave was 2 seconds, I feel like the writers got lazy because without the go pros they would have had to figure out how to explain the time gap but they did the job well. Some reviews are saying she didn't age and time didn't went quicker, it doesn't work like that. When you're at the top time goes by regularly.One of my issues was the ending, the giant futuristic dude with nano stairs and cool gadgets came with no weapons. Also with no way of communicating in English, really, 1000 years of advancement and you lost Google Translate lol. Also I dislike he had a video of the news when they went missing but somehow it didn't seem like he was going to fetch them at first.

Halfway through I remember thinking that 'Hollywood' should remake this because it's such an amazing setting. And then, by the end, I just thought, 'You know what? This movie is perfect just the way it is.' I wish I could come out of the cave a few years in the future to witness this movie being regarded as the cult classic that I think it's going to be. Its flaws feel like the endearing idiosyncrasies that you come to love in the type of movie that ends up having a cult following. I gave it a 10 despite its shortcomings simply because I'm still smiling from the thrill ride. Because although it did start (excruciatingly) slowly, it ended up erupting like a volcano.

There are others already trapped in the cave including some stone age brown skinned people who probably got in there in just a few minutes of local time while eons pass outside so we have Indians, Spanish conquistadors, Stone age cave people, a few modern humans, and a space man who can't breathe the local air but who knows of the healing power of the water. Oddly, for a film made in the twenty-first century, all the white people are saved. The stone age folks are left behind, and the conquistadors and Indians are left stranded in their moment of time.Now, being a white guy myself I don't mind all the white folks being saved, but surely the writers could have planned a script in which some greater diversity of people were saved as well.",Time Trap

Superstar actors would not have made this movie better. In fact, they probably would have been a distraction. A superstar director would not have made this movie better.

As I was still mostly in the room I was privy to the movies awful dialogue, acting and storyline without having to pay much attention, but holy baws I couldn't get over how unrealistic the characters reactions to their surroundings were. One sees a massive sandstorm not too far in the distance, can't breath properly due to the air and a MASSIVE triangular ship in the sky and doesn't even remotely have a reaction to it's implications.

There are a couple of moments the characters played 'dumb'.. but what films dont have characters that take time to grasp whats going on? It's plot development.I found the storyline original, if you liked Guy Pearce's Time Machine, you will enjoy this. It's not a huge Holywood blockbuster with top cast, its an enjoyable time travel sci-fi flick.Those crying about fake reviews probably expected more from the film and had higher expectations, but reading through the posoitive reviews I can see they're genuine.What did leave me dissapointed was the ending, it was too rushed. They could have spent an extra 10 minutes on the film where they showed what happened to the human race, how they have evolved, what they knew about the cave, but instead it was ""Want to go to Mars?"" and finished!",Time Trap

But, this film is so much MORE than that, 'though I must admit it does start off in that direction. Then, the subtle shifts in direction and story changes turn ever so slightly as both the students, and you the viewer, figure out that all is not as it seems.This film sucks you in. It DELIVERS. Provided that you have the patience to stick around and PAY ATTENTION. My heart is still pounding from the fast twists and turns that the last 15 to 20 minutes took, which may have actually been ONLY 5, but felt so much longer, in a GOOD sense. And, it DEFINITELY needs a sequel to finish the story, cuz you really want to know what's next. While they all DO eventually get out of the cave system, the ending leaves you wanting to know more, but leaves it up to your imagination to fill that in.Looking at the spread of the different star ratings, clearly MORE people enjoyed this movie than the ones who decided to trash it. Frankly, I'm beginning to think that there are a bunch of reviewers who see it as their job to trash everything, which I'm not going to waste my time doing an detailed, by username analysis. Even though I could. I've got better things to do with my time.So, why did I give this a ten? Because it entertained and it gets you thinking. The film took you on a journey that turned out to be completely different from what you thought you'd end up. Are there flaws? Possibly, but I didn't see any during my first viewing. But, then again, I wasn't deliberately looking for them. Is it Oscar material? No. But, then so many Oscar winners of the past three decades weren't really as good as the Award ""System"" wanted you to believe. I'm pretty jaded when it comes to films and television. I bore easily. It takes a lot to leave me feeling the way this film did. Afterall, I did my undergraduate degree in Film and Television, I know how everything works.

Basically: ""Everybody we know and love is dead, but were celebrities and we can chill out on mars *Shrug* ""Lastly the acting is not good, mediocre at best, and the script really didn't help, there is a lot of cheesy lines and bad timing, and it completely breaks the immersion.I want to give this a 7 because I was intrigued and even some what entertained, but I just can't.",Time Trap

I am sure if you think about it enough you can find some flaws..but I think I can explain (at least for myself) how it makes sense. I also agree with another reviewer who said it was NOT time travel.

Although not entirely new, I dd feel the film presented ideas about the way the characters time travelled and time itself in a different and clever way. The script was good enough to keep me engaged, despite most of the film being set in caves underground. For a low budget film, I felt that a lot of thought and work had gone into it.

I offer this review as a heads up.There is so much superfluous useless crap and so little character/ plot development it's a shame. Head into this movie knowing it could have been SO MUCH BETTER. They introduce interesting stories and plots potential characters at the end after an hour of inane prattle and wandering into a ""realization "" you figured out 20 minutes into the movie. Ask the interesting ideas, characters and potential side plots will be ignored and the ending will be quasi happy and utterly idiotic having pretty much NOTHING to do with any of the things you just watched.It's not bad, it's definitely not good. What sucks most is that it could have been great. If you can deal with watching so much promise vanish like a fart in the wind, you're good to go giving this a watch.I hope somebody with some actual skill gets a hold of this idea and produces something amazing. You can FEEL the awesome it could have been. It didn't need money to get there either. Gah, squandered potential.Try again guys. More story, less teen angst and fake family film schlock.

I felt Brianne Howey who played Jackie is outstanding that put her on the radar. The time element piece is very original.

The acting is not bad, but not great.But its the ideas and the slow build up that works so well. Time Trap is seductive.All of the action is happening outside of the cave, but it doesn't matter because we have the naive perspective of the people exploring the cave.It's a little slow ins the first 30 minutes, but you at the end, you want to change the title from ""Time Trap"" to ""How I avoided the apocalypse.""

Today, boredom finally caught up with me and I pressed the 'Play' button...Its no Hollywood blockbuster that's for sure. But, it was enjoyable. The teenage boy Furby(?) has some of the best lines in the film to be honest. The use of Go-Pro's as a filming medium was a nice touch too.Now, here are some spoilers and ""really?!?"" moments, if you've not already read other reviews...When the professor first sees the cowboy inside the cave, then comes back a few days later and he's in *the exact same spot/pose* that should've been his first ""wtf?"" instinct (personally I'd've tried to get his attention by throwing a rock at him (which would've stopped in mid air like the Chem-light does later...) at which point the film could've ended)...I'm no Hawking or Einstein, so I don't know how time-shifts work...but, how many seconds (to the cave exploring students) had passed before teen Furby decided a day or two was long enough to wait and go exploring on his own? Seemed like they'd been there an hour? Meh. Time travel is headwork.Surely a healthy strong bloke like the male 'hero' in the film could outsmart and possibly out fight some cavemen who had never heard of self defense classes?One possible plot error that possibly isn't, is when the blonde babe climbs out the chimney cave to use a GPS. If my alcohol soaked brain comprehends this bit right, the second she crossed that time barrier, time slowed/stopped in the cave but for her it continued as normal, then when she went back into the cave, she went back to the time-speed of her mates... Right, got that bit now.I'd recommend watching this film, and turning off any part of the brain that expects to watch Hamlet, or Les Mis' etc. Its a fun, daft, but enjoyable film, and doesn't deserve the complete slating it's had from other reviews to give it its due.",Time Trap

It is a little slow to start, characters are sometimes doing inexplicable stupid things, but hey, if I found myself in a time trap, maybe I would do stupid things too and have a brain freeze. Who am I to judge?The thing is that the details do not really matter, the story is gripping, original and just clever.
It's not trying to go into complicated explanations or philosophical points or be more than the experience itself. It's just taking you in the moment of the situation - there is suspense and I really had no idea where this was going to go.

I don't get chance to watch many movies, but I just love Sci-Fi. Typically, Sci-Fi movies are predictable, but this one was something else. For a low budget movie, it really pushed my brain into a lot of ""what if?""'s. I was incredibly impressed. The acting was sufficient for a movie of this budget, and the effects were ""just enough"" and totally believable. Nothing was overdone. Nothing was underdone. It was, somehow, just right.My take from the reviews of this movie is that too many people are after the next Marvel offering. No one simply wants a decent story that makes you think. This movie is the latter. It might not hold you on the edge of your seat, but you will stop and ponder it after the movie has ended.

In the cave they find others who have also gotten stuck in the time trap over the years.Do the students get rescued or not? Are they stuck in the caves forever? And if they are rescued, how has time progressed up above the caves?Some of the acting is better than others, some of the written lines are better than others. Budget is moderate with limited special effects. All in all, found the movie entertaining for 1.5 hrs. Check it out.",Time Trap

You can easily summarize this in a sentence;""5 teens got lost in a cave going after their proffessor and found themselves in the future"" done.This movie is wasted effort/time for producers and for viewers,if it had any substance in it my opinion would be way different.How come you waste so much time working scenes,cameras,action,costumes,lights etc. but give no thought to the STORY itself?",Time Trap
549,greenwizarddtrammel,"A Good Little Independent Film, Worth The watch",7,18 August 2018,"As a movie special effects veteran of over a decade, from mid 1990s to mid 2000s, I had the pleasure and the pain of contributing to many independent films. Some with micro budgets, some with millions. Every one was a joy to work on and the entire crew and cast was usually quite proud of their work.Sometimes this was honest pride and sometimes you knew the film sucked but wanted it as an add to your resume, so you could go on to better movies and better pay. I can say to the crew and cast of ""Time Trap"", you did well on this film.Good job, each and everyone of you. As a viewer, I found the time I took to watch this, well spent. As a ex-movie professional, you did an outstanding job crafting a good film. I look forward to the next project from this team.Without giving away too much, to those that haven't watched this film, there is a temporal bubble, which surrounds a cave system. Enter it and time slows down, very down. For the four characters who accidentally enters this effect, it is strange and takes them some time to figure out. Points to the writer that they don't make it easy on them with an ultra wise character who knows all.There is some problems and some things left unsaid in the end. I would have preferred some explanations of what was really happening BUT I would be wrong to want that.Overall, Time Trap delivers a well put together film, worth the time to watch.",Time Trap

The entire idea of the time cave is awesome, and how it works. The execution? Meh.

I won't spoil it, but they dropped the ball on it.

For audiences who used to watch normal back and forth time travel movie, this is hard to chew. Then they would give 1 star. Mostly because they can't accept that concept.Is it worth 9 stars? Probably not. It's b-grade movie with sub-standard acting, shallow characters and simple dialogs. But story wise, I never seen one like this.

Im using ""Freaks"" as a point of reference as i watched it yesterday i gave it a 7. It was, as is this movie a novel idea for a scifi and i truly enjoyed both tbh i liked this one a bit more although the acting can be a bit more polished it definitely was not cringe worthy unfortunately except the dad but luckily he has like 2min air time.

I honestly am surprised by the many extremely sharknado type scores as this is far better and watching it i didnt reveal to me that it was low budget except that im not familiar with the actors.Sorry to sound like im rambling i never write reviews but thought this movie does not deserve to be portrayed as that bad.

The whole premise of the time trap in a cave is cool, but this film completely misses the huge opportunity and it goes nowhere. It lacks emotion in characters and in the writing, and the acting didn't help either. Plot and story are never consistent. Certain plot holes weren't answered and didn't matter at the end, so what was the point. It also didn't need to be 90 minutes. The longer run time actually ruined the pacing and made the rest of the movie boring. Wish it was shorter, like at least 40 minutes. The shorter, the better. Misleading trailer also.

597,paul-684-18075,Clever but flawed,6,11 December 2020,"Sadly, the execution and, ironically (given that the story is about time differentials) the pacing too, falls off in a lot of parts in this, especially in the second half as the climax builds.I won't spoil the core feature of the story, although it is revealed about halfway, and sci-fi-savvy viewers will figure it out anyway long before this - perhaps within the first few minutes. I feel this story feature was certainly inspired in large part by a memorable and key scene of the 1960 movie The Time Machine (and reproduced in the 2002 remake of the same).
I can't fault it for being derivative in that way, and as a result the story concept is rather clever. I just wish the producers had made a better movie from what is a great sci-fi concept.

The flashlight pointing into the cave shouldn't be reflecting at normal speed.2. The movement of the rope thrown down the cave, supposed to be visibly slow down.3. The cellphone signal... I don't think there is a ping timeout timer between the cell tower and the phone that can last for days / weeks /months. Thus it must be impossible to get any content streaming in the cave.4. The signal of the ""lense tentacles"" from the outside should also transmitting slower in the cave, but in this case, the advance technology may can breakthrough the timetrap, or perhaps, people in the future have the patient to spend days / weeks / months / years to rescue Hopper.

The clever professor finds his parents' brightly-coloured Kombi some 40-years later and enters the 'rip'. Incredibly, time almost stops in the cave but speeds along outside. Some 24 hours later his students mount a rescue mission to find him. Inexplicably, later in the movie, 24 hours seems to amount to hundreds if not thousands of years outside (yes, really). Cue cavemen, spacemen, spaceships, and you have 90 minutes of ridiculousness that you will be left cursing the loss of. Yes, it is indeed a time trap, but of the worst kind.

I can't belive I am writing a review of a 1 mln. dollar TV movie.Let's put out the pros first:The plot of the movie is just amazing! I haven't watched a movie with such a good plot for at least 15 or more years. An archeology professor go on a search alone for a missing couple in the 70-es, alone because, this were his parents looking for the fountain of youth. Of course you get to know that somewhere at the end. His students want to suprise him and go after him to go in the same cave he went. Then the amazing plot starts to open - once the students enter the cave the time in it stops and the time outside starts to run extremely fast. Their ropes are cut from the cave and they can't get out. One of the crew manages to go outside to find .... you just have to watch it.After that another of the young adventures finds out that .... In other words the movie has a lot of unexpected twist which make you expect what would be the next one. The most amazing part is when Taylor finds Hopper and sees the next level dimention which explains the other ones. And the ending's just great - do they all die or get out of the cave, does only one survive, do they at all get out or decide to stay behind the Fountain of Youth you just have to find out yourself. I bet you will like the ending.The effects are great too. The smapce man and his ladder and everything after and before that was on spot and really great. The day and night shift also.The actors was really good too. I haven't noticed until later that Andrew was Beef Supreme fom Idiocracy. His role was the most authentic one from all the others.And a little bit of cons:The pacing of the movie had to be done better and faster, the Fountain of Youth/Healing had to be clean transparent glowing water with some kind of effects from it and in a better bigger place and Furby - the should 've used better kid actor for this. Everything else was just great.The realistic score of the movie refering the extremely low budget for me is 8/10, but imagine they used more money for effects, 1-2 better actors and better and wider palces in the cave. This would've been the greatest Sci-Fi movie of all time. Still I liked it very much like that snd watched it 4 times. I hope they do even better sequel with 10 times bigger budget.Worth watching from every man on earth. 10/10 just to boost the score from the the haters and the others who somehow didn't like this low budget masterpiece.",Time Trap

Interesting in any part, a little predictable and sometimes slow but still gives you enough to say ""it was a good one"".Would love to see what would happen next....

Yes, some of the acting isn't 100% and some of the characters are a little annoying... but since when did annoying characters spoil a movie?

I made my imdb account tonight specifically to review this movie because I haven't been so in the dark about where a storyline was headed and I loved it! It was question after question and suprises everywhere.
The characters are fleshed out enough to have personalities without distracting from the plot and I did care when one of them is killed off. Some of the costumes aren't top shelf, nor are some of the special effects, but they are serviceable and again don't distract too much. Then again in important scenes the special effects can be really impressive. The scenes where people are stuck in the ""time jelly"" are a feast for the eyes. I am in love with how they move the camera through the scene like it's a diorama so you can see all the people in relation to one another.

659,miacle,Everyone has a different point of view,8,20 September 2019,I did not have an account before watching Time Trap. However. After reading the reviews It made me think this was going to be a really bad movie and it wasn't. I can see how something like this could evolve. I think the acting was good and I liked how it evolved. I enjoyed it and if you think it's slow continue to watch. It's not unrealistic.,Time Trap
660,pjshine213,Interesting but . . .,5,24 September 2019,This is the thing. I really wanted to like this movie. The beginning was so promising. I knew it was low budget and it can be hard to carry off sci-fi. It was going well when the actor named Hopper was carrying it. He's clearly a good actor. Then we switched to an ensemble. Many of the actors in the ensemble weren't as strong. The actress who plays Jackie felt like a stage actress. She was playing everything way too big for a small screen. Acting makes or breaks a movie like this. In some of the scenes it took me out of the movie making it difficult to suspend disbelief.,Time Trap

And as if progressed it kept me nailed there watching. Don't know why people have negative feedback. If you're in to SciFi then you must watch it. The idea is very nice (reminded me of Star Trek) and about time relativity (as its name implies). Watch it if you're into SciFi and you'll see that others (who gave lower ratings) are almost wrong.

Ive literally been looking for a film like that for years and this is the closest to be fair. Now the actors r quite cheesy but all is good until 3/4 of the way through where aliens and neanderthals enter the film lol ikr, and the main characters start making stupid decisions. either way id just watch it for the concept, sooooo cool. they should make a series like it.

The movie doesn't have a whole lot of ""logic"" to it, but if you have a mind that can adapt to abstract thought and can accept concepts that go against what we currently see as ""rational"" or ""achievable"" you'll love it just like I did. They only had $1 million budget to make this film. That may sound like a lot but Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker had a $275 million budget.

With the right people this is massively entertaining.
Now, I feel like I should say something about the plot.. or the acting. Lets just be honest though, you knew what you were getting into. These characters, though, passed off as somewhat educated, are literally the dumbest group of idiots to trip into a time loop in the history of sci-fi. The only reason they survive is the giant MacGuffin of spaceship Triangle. But.....space triangle, I am still laughing so hard I am crying soooo two stars or ten, who is keeping track anymore?

If that is you walk away now.For everyone else...You need a level of intelligence to enjoy this film and you must watch it all the way till the end... that's where all the multitude of tiny long threads come together and you understand it, so long as you paid attention to all the clues.The budget is really irrelevant.It was a good story told well. The actors/writers/directors/producers got all sort of little details right to help you understand who is what, where they have come from and going to; and what is happening to them.This film is pretty much a sci-fi whodunnit, how, why and 'where are they now'? The clues are all there to work it out and enjoy the end, which gives enormous satisfaction.It doesn't have a big budget for special effects and I think they have done magnificently with what they had.The negative reviews clearly come from people who couldn't/didn't pay attention to the details and then put the necessary 2 and 2 together, bless them.",Time Trap
676,aabramsnt,Great concept and effects. Characters so dumb that you'll be screaming at your screen,6,18 March 2020,"Let me first disclose that this is my first review I have ever written on here. I made an account SPECIFICALLY just to review this movie because of how infuriated the characters made me while watching. Throughout the whole movie you'll constantly be asking yourself ""why would they do that"" or ""why didnt you just do this"". The most infuriating part was watching a group of the main characters standing over a dying man screaming that he's dying and what he's dying from, but then helplessly do nothing. ""We have to save him!"" one of them shouts as they do literally nothing, and then watch him helpessly struggle from another threat. Both of which they could have helped easily. It could have otherwise been a fantastic film if the writing for some of the characters wasn't so poor. Seriously, everything else was great. The ending could have been a bit better, as I feel like it could have answered a few more questions and been a little less mysterious.",Time Trap

I get it did have a couple flaws but I think it was an overall great movie to watch.It had me on the edge of my seat the entire time just because I was stressed out for them. It's a really good idea and they did great things with it. I haven't seen a movie like this anywhere before.I'll admit, the beginning is pretty rough and drags on. Once you get over that it's all stress the whole way through. There's twists and turns all over the place. You never really expect any of these things to happen and you're shocked every time.I'm reading a lot of reviews that marks this movie as being terrible and saying all these reviews are paid for. I'm 100% not paid for or lying. I really only watched it because it peaked my interest but mostly because it's going off Netflix April 12 2020 so I wanted to at least watch it before I couldn't anymore.Don't read into all the bad reviews. If you are looking for a cool sci-fi suspenseful movie you'll at least enjoy it. I don't really think into how everything works and I didn't even notice the flaws until I read the reviews of people 'smarter' than me. I don't analyze every aspect of the movie. I watch things to enjoy them, not to critique them. There's another reason you know I'm not being paid to write this lol.Anyways enjoy the movie if you're about to watch it, and if you just finished then I hope it was as great to you as it was to me!",Time Trap

Acting was good, story line was amazing.
I've watched tons of movies like this and this one leaves you wanting more.
Hopefully they make a second one to answer the questions the first leaves you with.
Definitely answered some of the questions you are wondering about throughout the movie. But the ending leaves you wanting more and asking how they got to where they did. Who was the person that helped them out. How did hopper and his parents know about it. How did his sister get down there if she was sick. How long were they really down there for. Where are they now. What is going to happen next. Would love to see more background about the cave as well as more about what their future now has in store.
Fingers crossed these questions and more get answered!!",Time Trap
680,bleiddthetraveler,This MOVIE Is a Time Trap,3,11 April 2020,"If you're looking for a good movie, you will not find one here. This is the movie version of telling instead of showing. It's a whole lot of boring nothing, and we got more enjoyment out of laughing at how bad the movie was than watching the actual movie.
My best complements would go to the graphic. They were surprisingly polished. Otherwise, there isn't much. The setup of everything was good, but by the end things get so crazy that I forgot how the movie even started. It almost feels like the writers set out to make one story and completely shifted gears somewhere in between.
The acting is bad, and 100% broke the scenes for me. The characters lacked a lot of depth and any sort of human feeling. Their personalities were basic surface level, of that. Any that they would have had is completely ruined by their acting. To maintain the suspense, the characters have to remain stupidly unaware of the situation they're in. I won't give any spoilers, but the characters seem to be completely unaffected by their situation. They don't seem to care about what's happened to their reality, or react with an kind of human emotion.
Most of the movie is the characters just being in the cave. I was legitimately bored way too often throughout, and suddenly things get super crazy towards the end. The pacing is honestly terrible because there's so much NOTHING in this movie. It takes them half the movie for anything relatively exciting to happen to the characters, despite some drama in between.
The concept had the potential to be really interesting, but by the end, things were way off the rails and I honestly forgot where the movie started. It was like they took a bunch of concepts that had the potential to be cool, smashed them all together and hoped it would work. The idea was cool, but the rest of it was so bad that it didn't come together right.
If you're looking for an enjoyable, exciting movie to feel immersed in, you'll need to look elsewhere. If you're looking to waste a good hour and a half of your day, then you're in the right place. If you're looking to laugh at an all-over-the-place movie creation, this just might be what you're looking for.",Time Trap
681,seanburrage,"Smart, Surprising and Intelligent Thriller!",9,18 April 2020,"Timetrap was much better than expected. The marketing on Netflix didn't do it justice and, in my opinion, soared way above the dumbed-down blurb on the description page.The creators of this movie have clearly put a lot of thought into how best and cleverly to portray the different time concepts used for the story. The acting, even from the youngest of the cast was surprisingly good and watchable.But I really need to mention that story-line again; it was just so clever and scientifically accurate (albeit the whole thing far-fetched), and often left me sat there trying to wrap my head around some of the time distorting concepts used throughout the film, that were also actually quite disturbing to think about in depth.Will definitely be watching this again.",Time Trap

690,rachrichardson-07653,"A great family sci-fi, to rival the Goonies.",8,29 June 2020,"Like the reviewer immediately before me, this is my first review - I also set up an IMDB account purely to write a review of this film because of all the suggestions below that the good reviews were fake. Sci fi is my favourite genre and I have watched just about every film in the category. This is NOT a fake review. I really enjoyed Time Trap.It is true that that about 5 minutes into the film, whilst the first of the blonde sisters was talking I nearly switched off - her acting isn't great and she does remain mildly annoying / moronic pretty much throughout the film (but then there are many non-acting humans who fall into this category so that probably actually makes the film more realistic).But shortly thereafter the group of kids and teens head off to start their adventure and my interest picked up - the flick now becomes reminiscent of the goonies - and there is even a nice reference to the goonies around this point.Honestly from this point on the film gets better and better. I could not predict what was going to happen next at any point and that is unusual for me having seen SO many movies (not just sci fis).Any movie I see with a novel plot and twists I cannot predict gets a thumbs up from me. The special effects were also really good. The slowing down of time is depicted really well and the interspersing of humans from several different time periods is imaginative and done very differently to other time travel flicks.Yes there are a few sloppy bits - what happened to the dog? Why didn't the police find the hippy van or the teenagers truck and move them? Why didn't the police find the very obvious caves complete with very obvious ropes sticking out of them right next to the missing peoples's trucks?! Why is it that a few seconds in the cave is half an hour when she gets out the cave and comes back in but actually we can see that a few seconds in the cave is actually a few years (or summer solstice rotations)? And yes the main professor guy's acting is also a bit lame or character odd - but his whole family did go missing without explanation 25 years ago - probably enough to screw most people up!But, despite all of this, I ended up really really enjoying the movie! The ideas are original, the effects are as good in any high budget movie, you start to really like one or two of the characters and I really liked the ending - (I'm assuming they displayed their sadness at never seeing any of their earthly contemporaries again off screen!). A great family sci fi movie to rival the goonies and a good lesson to give low budget / low profile movies a go. I would definitely watch a sequel.",Time Trap

The actors, though kinda shoved into a plot and without much background, are able to carry their own weight. This movie definitely could have benefited from a slightly longer runtime to give the plot and backstory and little more solid start. Use of FX is low but well done in the places it is used. Movie builds up gradually with a solid ending and the action is spaced just well enough that you aren't reaching for your phone.Overall my recommendation is to just watch this movie, there's a good chance you will at least enjoy it.

716,dstanley-99897,It was okay,6,25 March 2021,It lacked structure that would have made this a great movie. I also thought the ending could have been better and more thought out. It was all most as if the ending was just thrown in to get a finished product with out much thought to details for the audience. After having everything in our faces we suddenly have to decide for ourselves the details of what became of the human race. How did they communicate with each other? They couldn't even communicate with a human from thousands of years behind the modern humans. Why did they wait so long to help the people in the cave? When Cara went up top the Arc all ready existed but that was thousands of years before the ending and they are on the same exact type of vehicles. Those are some of the things I would have liked to have answered.,Time Trap

Funny thing is that I actually created almost identical premise years ago on a pen and paper RPG adventure. And no I can watch it come alive on screen!

Also it started slow like a ""normal"" and then suddenly it started to ""run"" so fast like a commercial on YouTube. It feels like the directors divide the job and each one did half of the movie. Like in the plot, the movie had different time cap in every sence, maybe it was on purpose or a mistake, just like all of this movie. Yet, I liked it. I was unintentionally funny, made you think and you get really into it. But then suddenly it's over.

Like I don't know how an actual person could find anything redeemable about this steaming pile of a movie.First production value: think the lower end of like a made for Sci-fi channel show, which feels a little insulting to Scifi, still. The effects are what you expect from a recent low budget flick, bad but you can ignore them because they do their best to work around having to show anything.Cast: think WB or like 90's after school special, a handful of extremely annoying, clean cut white kids a couple skinny blondes with tight clothes, yay. Then the ""professor"" who sometimes has a southern accent but otherwise just checks out caves alone with a flashlight like most archaeologists.Acting: the acting is pretty bad, but I don't want to blame them, the writing is so atrocious and obnoxious. The characters are infuriatingly stupid. Nothing is logical about how anyone interacts with each other. Like think the worst of ""the walking dead"" show but on steroids. Arguing for no reason about nothing, sometimes while other random dangerous things are happening around them but ignored. People delivering lines looking at something but not actually doing any of those things because they're confined to a 10 ft area of fake rocks to do everything in.Cave people: yes there are eventually cave people who attack them because... they're cave people? A few people in fake fur undies and bad long hair wigs with some dirt blackface. Then they have to fight a dude ""from the future"" who apparently has forgotten how to convey anything whatsoever with hands, gestures, anything.A weird abrupt ending that basically says ""yeah, so that's what happened and now were here!

I agree with everyone saying that it is weird to bring kids to a clearly dangerous situation. Bad big sister. The name of the film should have been TimeTRASH!!

Plus it was only an hour and a half long.As a huge fan of Sci-Fi/ Time-Traveling movies this one definitely caught my eye. The movie had a great plot despite the low budget, definitely felt like a B movie although the Professor sounded just like Owen Wilson.After the first 15 minutes or so I was sucked in to see how the plot would unfold. As a couple other reviewers mentioned, there was a slight horror feel to a couple parts but nothing to make you close your eyes.However, to get to my headline, the major flaw IMO was the ending. They built it up so much and then to end it the way they did left me confused and wanting more, believe it or not.

734,peterzachos-3,"WHY did it need to be called ""Time Trap""?",3,28 December 2018,"Another new movie with a fine concept, and mostly awful execution. There is an excellent film waiting to be made from this intriguing premise. Unfortunately, the acting in this one is so incompetent, so awful, it belies description. When talented actors do their job, you neither notice nor think about their acting, because you have bought into the characters and are invested in the story. The terrible acting in Time Trap prevents this investment, and it's a serious, serious flaw that undermines the production.Further, I'm uncertain as to whether Mark Dennis or the producers intended for the movie to be titled ""Time Trap"", or whether it was a last-minute requirement from distribution or funders, but it smells like the latter. The title ""Time Trap"" literally gives away the best mystery of the film. If the movie had a more inconspicuous title, the characters' slow but steady discovery of their situation would have kept pace with our own... and of course that would mean we'd be more invested in them and their plight, since we're figuring things out with them. As it stands, we are watching bad actors act badly while they try to figure out something we already know. What an awful, awful decision; again, it makes me wonder if the people involved got nervous, and realized they needed a sharper hook to lure Netflix users in to click ""Play"".What a shame the movie doesn't have the quality of its concept.

Sure, some of the acting was bad and some parts didn't make much sense but, in parts, it was quite thought provoking. It was interesting to see someones vision of what the planet would be like so far into the future.

Since no one posted any trivia (which I like to peruse after seeing some movies), I went looking around some of the cast and crew bios. When I came to the director's bio and I saw a still of him directing 'Synchole', I realized that if the original name was that much more intelligent, then they probably changed too many other things, because someone felt the need to explain more of the plot than they had originally intended. Basically they explained too much, and simplified the plot a bit, all at the expense of additional character development and plot lines. Too many of the characters lost their arc (most of the characters had no real growth other than Furby) that the writers/directors seemingly originally had planed, and I also believe that they wanted to give us a bit more information on the cowboy (with the hat covering his face, it is likely that they probably even shot a deeper storyline for him), along with other plot lines.

747,frankyinny,"You will like this movie, if you like shows like ""The Outer Limits""",7,29 March 2020,"-First I need to comment on some of the other reviews. I believe the haters are young and don't have extensive movie experience and that's why they give a unrealistic rating of 1 star.-Time Trap has a good sci-fi concept and the film quality and the special effects are very good when used. In the cave it can feel slow, similar to an origin story movie. You have to be forgiving of that, because it is the twist on the fountain of youth concept that is actually the gem in this movie. I have not seen this take on that idea and it is what kept me watching it through to the end.Spoiler starts here:-The film relies heavily on the actors and takes place mostly in the cave, except for the very beginning and the very end. So it would be a bit tough to watch in a theater. At home, running back and forth to get snacks and drinks, it was great.-At first I am thinking the fountain of youth is the frozen time, because you can go in the cave and then come out looking young, while everyone else has aged. Then later there actually are waters with healing powers and maybe the time barriers are there to protect the source of the water or whatever is causing the time barriers is giving the water its healing properties. I believe you could live there forever without starving if you keep drinking the water to heal yourself. In the end, it had a very ""Lost in Space"" type of feel to it. Everyone is alive and together. Sadly everyone and everything they knew is gone forever, but they are also going to travel through space and explore the future. I hope the spaceman that helped him is alive too and that he wasn't there trying to bring back the healing water for someone, because it seemed like he was watching a countdown of his time left. I assumed he was an earthling from Mars and adapted to the atmosphere on Mars, that's why he couldn't breath on earth. I would like to know more about what happened to everyone actually.",Time Trap

764,wight1984,Good concept with okay execution. Bad and uninteresting characters,6,19 April 2020,"I'm only writing this because most people seem to be either trashing this film or rating it much too highly. I don't think it's a great film: the characters aren't well-written and their character arches aren't interesting. However, I think the concept is okay and it's worth watching (if you like time travel as a concept) for that reason alone. I'm also seeing a lot of reviews that seem to unfairly criticising portrayal of time.SPOILERS FROM THIS POINT ON, INCLUDING DETAILED PLOT POINTSInside the cave, entire years pass within seconds. That means that time is close to frozen inside the cave.In some cases, people leave the cave and re-enter. In one case, they leave for 30 minutes and return to find that no time has passed for those left behind. This is consistent with what we know about time within the cave.Here's the timeline as I see it from the cave's perspective:
Prehistoric man enters the cave a very long time ago.Some time passes. Spanish explorers enter the cave a long time after that.More time passes. A Cowboy enters the cave.A few minutes (at most) pass, then the professor's parents enter the cave.Less than a minute later, the professor, his students, and Firby all enter the cave at almost exactly the same time /via three different entrances/Cara leaves the cave and instantly returns (gone for 30 minutes in her perspective, not enough time to register for anyone inside)The professor leaves the cave and instantly returns (again, not gone long enough for time to have noticeably moved inside the cave)Everything else happens within the cave and the world spins by at an accelerated rate outside. I think it's important to note that the all the modern era explorers enter the cave at the same subjective time; their plot lines all start at approximately the same time within the cave. This is why they story has multiple entrances to the cave (otherwise, they'd all see each other just like the professor sees the cowboy in the way in). The only flaw here is that the students descended into the cave in two groups and the first group should have found the second group waiting for them (frozen) on the other side of the barrier (although there seems to be a bit of a transitional period in some of the barriers so maybe that's what happened there).I thought Firby radioed too late at first but, on thinking about it, he was probably falling through his entrance at the same time the others were scaling down the wall in theirs. Once he hits the ground, he's on the same time as everyone else and it takes him a while to radio for help.Other things that could have been better:The healing water was never explained. The professor suggested that the time dilation was there to protect the healing water but that's never justified or explained either. The time dilation and healing water have both been there since at least prehistoric times so if one was created to protect the others then that raises questions about who would have done that.The glimpses we get of the future are vague and we don't get any detail on the evolved humans or their society, although that might have been for the best.The characters react very strangely to their situation, which is just bad writing, but they're mostly just vehicles for the concept. I liked the concept and I enjoyed the glimpses of a future Earth so I didn't mind the lacklustre characterisation.",Time Trap

I place a lot of stock in IMDB ratings and content but the reviews and ratings for this film are so polarised it will leave a lot of people wondering ? There are lots of reviewers giving this film 1 star for example.... I think such people are either trolling, unreasonable idiots, people who feel big for belittling the hard work of others or film snobs that expect every film to be like the Godfather. Fair enough if you didn't like it but its just spiteful to give this film 1 star. This movie on a small budget was totally engaging and kept me wondering what was going to happen next. A simple premise (which great films have) is nicely explored and there were plenty of twists and surprises. The special effects I thought were great and perfectly acceptable so don't know what people are complaining about. The acting was absolutely fine but agree some of the characters were a bit annoying at times and some script elements could have been tweaked but actually its on the whole pretty good. I love sci fi movies with a time travel element and this one totally delivered with some really imaginative elements. I'm giving this film 8/10 based on how much I enjoyed it rather than the quality of each element painfully dissected.

Spoilers ahead...The scene is where the one woman, I forget her name, climbs up to the surface for a while then returns. People keep saying it's a plot hole that she hadn't aged when she came back down. Well, she did age...by a half an hour. That's how long she was on the surface, she said so herself. For the people down in the cave, virtually no time at all had passed. They even demonstrate this by playing their recording to show that no time had passed. We hear her say ""I'm almost to the top"" then an instant later we hear her say ""you won't believe what happened."" 30 minutes passed for her, while maybe a second passed for the people in the cave. So what, are people expecting that after spending 30 minutes on the surface she would come back down an old woman? Now THAT would make no sense. I just felt it necessary to point that out, since a number of other reviews are calling this a plot hole, when it really isn't. Kinda seems like they're missing the entire premise of the movie.Aside from that, it was an interesting idea, but shoddy execution. It was decent until the cave men and the eight foot tall Power Ranger show up. Then it just goes off the rails. But honestly, I thought it was an entertaining enough 90 minutes, and was far better than The Descent, which I thought was a strangely overrated pile of predictable garbage.

Audience-wise, I think the film does skew towards a younger crowd (YA for sure) - think Goonies, Explorers, Back To The Future. But, it's also refreshing to watch a fun film without excessive violence, profanity or nudity that all ages can enjoy. Storyline touches on some cool topics - glitches in the time-space continuum, group of kids needing to save the day, the fountain of youth. For the nerdier bunch and film geeks like myself, you'll want to stay up late discussing possible metaphors the cave represents, Earth's lifespan, and reminisce over those cool 80's movies this one resembles. Also, Team Furby! Oh, and if you get really deep and catch the Harry Potter connection, let me know.It's beautifully shot, well-written, the sfx look fantastic, locations are super cool - and the two youngest actors give subtle but powerful performances that speak to the directors' talent and skill. For a low-budget indie feature, these filmmakers deliver a crazy good film. Can't wait to see what they can do with more assets. Especially loved the beautiful and evocative musical score.The only reason I'm giving 9 stars is because I wanted to explore more in this world - the cave and the relationships. It would do really well as an 8-10 episode limited series in the vein of Quantum Leap/Star Trek where the kids can explore different times/eras depending on which cave tunnel they delve into. Once in space though, the adventures are endless. Worth checking out!",Time Trap

Holy God, how annoying these characters are. They are so ridiculously stupid and annoying that you will be screaming at your screen.

First of all I must say that I've watched it 4 times within 2 weeks!
Time trap is a movie with an amazing subject! Very well filmed, if you are a SiFy fan then you will like this movie a lot since its theme is not something we ever saw in another movie. It's a subcategory by its own!
The reason why I strongly feel that I had to somehow contact with the makers, even though I believe that my comment about it is not something that has not caught the attention of the makers, but it is something that must be emphasized!!
The length of the movie is 87-90 minutes and personally, after every single time of the 4 that I watched it, was left with a strong emotion. 
I believe that all experienced sify movie fans feel that this great themed movie can be characterized as a demo movie around its story or better said a demo to its theme. It can easily become a series for tv and I believe that more movies like a Time Trap 2 and Time Trap 3 and 4 movies can very easily be released in the ne t years! Don't get me wrong, as I said, all sify fans must watch it and most of them will see this potential and I want to believe that more of this movie will be released in the coming years!
Amazing theme which leaves you for wanting more, actually much more of it!
I really hope that we will see more parts soon and that the makers and producers will not be able not to release parts 2, 3 and even 4, or even better if you ask me, to release the first season of a Time Trap made for TV!

It's an intriguing premise, and I think they managed to pull it off fairly well.I really don't understand the vitriol directed by so many reviewers at this low budget movie. It's well written, competently acted, and the few special effects it had were pretty good. It seems like a lot of people were apparently too stupid to understand what was happening and so this movie is ""confusing"". If you have half a brain, it's really not that complicated.My main criticism is the ending, it was rather rushed. But considering the direction of the movie, I don't know where else they could have gone with it without just killing everyone, which I am glad they didn't do.All in all, if you enjoy thought-provoking sci-fi, I'd give it a try.

Various cultures from different time periods have either become trapped within the caves or visit to syphon off the illusive 'healing, fountain of youth'.
However upon entering the caves any adventurer can ensure they would never return to their own time period as time comes to a slow crawl, meaning that hundreds of years pass in a matter of hours on the outside!!
We are taken on a journey through time, meeting different cultures from cavemen to our evolved human sate (as is implied!!) and even aliens... WEIRD RIGHT!?!?!
It's kinda rushed but not in a bad way and can easily be forgiven... Also this a type of of movie that has never been done in this manner before so hats off to the storyline & production team for quite a bold move... Especially on a not too noticeable low budget!!
Personally my main gripe with this film is I wish they'd have given us another 10 minutes... I probably would have increased the rating then!!... watch it and I'm sure you'll agree!?!

The movie ended a little too soon, imo. I wanted to learn more about what actually happened to Earth, who that 8ft tall guy was, who those alien-looking hands belonged to, and how they took the cave ""portal"" off Earth. Also, when the girlfriend/big sister was being pulled out of the cave physically by those beings, were they ""wrestling"" her for years since they were technically still on the outside? Did the speed of the passing of time change when the opening became that pool?Also, I agree with everyone else on the dog character. He served no purpose to the movie, other than for the viewer to feel sad that he was presumably ""abandoned"" by the professor for the rest of his life. They could have at least had a scene of the dog returning to the kids indicating that something clearly wasn't right.",Time Trap

And the ending where they ended up on Mars and didn't seem to care that they would never see their families again....,Time Trap

It is what it's meant to be a low budget entertaining film that is actually alright . The 9 out of 10 reviews are not that correct but the ones giving it 1 or 2 out of 10 are wrong stop trying to be a film critic and see it for what it is . I enjoyed it I think you may too,Time Trap
840,to_sonia,White White White,3,3 June 2021,"I do like the story. A scientist view would have been nice but there is one thing I really dislike:
Two blondes. A hot blue eyed guy, two young 13 year olds who also are white. In the meantime the savage cavepeople are black and dark haired and have brown eyes (there are not even a consensus there. All should be black or white or in between in their group). Also the professor is white, blue eyed and his family he tries to save are blonde and blue eyed. The weird casting really shows when the aliens/advanced humans only save them and not the cavemen. The casting crew couldn't even cast an Hispanic person even though the setting in in south of California. I am Swedish and have visited US two times and I know better.",Time Trap
841,cody-80,A good story about the concept of time passing by...,9,2 December 2018,"I am a big fan of time travel movies. Even though this was B-type movie with new unknown actors, it's more than that to me. It's about the story itself and how it's being told. After watching the trailer it looked good enough to rent. After watching it I bought it right after I was done with the movie.SPOILER ALERT:
I wish they would have gone just a little further in the story at the end to see what they did on MARS. Also little more of how the technology would be envisioned in the future.But for those you wondering how long they where in the cave I did some calculations. I think I heard them say they had been down in the cave for about 4 hours, but could have been longer. Here are the calculations:One year passed every 4 - 6 seconds by observing the scene when you see the full cycle of the SUN streak by (Passing one direction *2-3 sec for first 2 solstices then passing back for the other 2 solstices) I will average it out to 5 seconds a year.Time Calculations;
------------------------------------------------
Seconds per year --------------> 5
Years per minute --------------> 12
Years per hour -----------------> 720
Hours in cave -------------------> 4
Years passed on surface ----> 2880Now at the end, on the scene when they leave for MARS you can clearly see it looks like the continents have shifted around. But they can't happen in a few thousand years. That takes 100.000 years or more to happen to the extreme you see on the film.But all and all a good movies to put into my collection.Thanks,
Cody Leaf",Time Trap
842,BardKE,What gem of a sci-fi movie!,8,10 October 2020,"Yes, it seems like a somewhat low-budget movie, and not all of the actors may have been picked from the very top shelf - but this movie has really got something!First of all it made me write my first review (hurray) because I liked it so much, and secondly, it left me with a sense of how we as humans so curiously relate to our limited time here in life, to the universe and to eternity. (When was the last time something like that happened? In Terminator 1 or Back To The Future?)This movie managed to send my philosophically wired brain on a good spin around all of this, and the elegant little effects when the characters entered the time trap, or looked out from it, combined with the suspenceful music, made my heart jump with fascination. And some of the scenes got burned into my soul - possibly forever - depending on how fast time flies by in your particular time zone.Possibly the best B-movie ever.",Time Trap

The action maintained a reasonable level of tension and kept my interest. And I loved the unexpected ending.One thing that annoyed me at the end though - why were the 20th century people rescued, but the cavemen abandoned? Aren't they people too?That felt wrong. To the people of the future, surely all of those trapped in the cave would be interesting and worth rescuing.",Time Trap

Interesting, beautiful, science fictiony in a believable way with a bit of drama in it's core. Wonderful acting, super scenery with a truly exceptional storyline. The first 10 minutes into the movie I remained a bit sceptic, but once they got into the cave I was hooked, my jaw literally dropped from excitement! Please would someone support these guys so they can continue to make great movies? Because sure as hell they got the know how!",Time Trap
849,Effysion,"Truly mindblowing, loved every minute of it.",8,18 April 2019,"One of my favorite movies. Despite the low budget, this movie is on par with a lot of bigger Hollywood movie because of the great writing. The concept is really original, and totally cool. It manages to captivate me from start to finish. While most Sci-Fi movies suffer from poor expositions (when the characters just stand around dumping info at the viewers), the way the plot unravel in Time Trap is really smart, and each reveal gives me chills. What I like about the characters is that they are not written as dumb and doing stupid stuff at the most crucial timing.However, some of the dialogues, especially at the start, are pretty cheese. There may be some inconsistencies with the time relativity, but I guess this is inevitable for almost all time travel movies, especially one with such a huge discrepancy (roughly 3-4s in the cave is one year outside). Despite this, for the most part, the filmmakers did a great job at getting the timing in the film right (I've read somewhere that the directors actually did the math regarding the time differences to make it as accurate as possible. Kudos to them).One small issue I had was the scene when 2 students are scaling down the cave, the other 2 at the top should see them as being ""frozen"" (like how the professor saw the cowboy). Instead, this did not happen in the movie. Apart from that, there are no other glaring plot holes which would diminish my viewing experience. Would definitely recommend.",Time Trap

852,robotadventures,Turn off your brain.,5,30 April 2018,"I saw the trailer and thought it had potential. It is not that good but worth watching in the background as you do something else. The visuals are nice, good effects, the the story is so weak. From the trailer, you can hear the concept and see the future. The concept had been done better in star trek and other stories. If you are a sci fi fan then you will see the plot holes easily. From the trailer you understand that time moves slower inside the cave. so people on the outside have a lot of time to plan. Maybe its a 3 or 4 but I gave it a 5 because i like sci-fi. it tried to be entertaining.",Time Trap

854,drodriguez-03954,Worth watching it,7,9 May 2018,"After reading a couple of reviews and being surprised by some negative ones and by the accusation of the good ones being paid, I decided to post my first one. Nobody is paying me to do this. I just watched the movie and the result is beyond my expectations. I'm giving it a 7, from a realistic point of view. If I take into account the budget, I should give it higher valuation.My favourite movies are time traveling sci-fi movies and I believe this one is worth watching it. It's new, from all point of views, and is not a story we have already seen. At least not me.Some dialogues could be better, yes. Increase your budget and hire Tarantino to write them. They are just normal, not ridiculous. And I have seen many movies, much more expensive and advertised than this one, that were absolutely ridiculous and not worth my time. It's not the case now.Some other reviews talk about flaws... I haven't seen them. At least not important ones. Actually, any time travelling movie has more flaws or paradoxes than this one as here there is no time travelling, just the fact that time slows down at a very specific location. Taking this into account, everything makes sense.To make a comparison. I recently watched 12 monkeys and I can say that, of course, there is better acting there but the plot is much more predictable from the begining. And I will not dare to criticize the actors from this movie. I have seen much worse acting, even from very well known actors.",Time Trap
855,oie-84962,The best movie IMHO,10,11 May 2018,The idea and implementation are incredible. It would be great if there was a continuation of this film.,Time Trap
856,lenxiii,Give us more.,10,21 May 2018,"Ok let's start out by being honest here, I'm not rating the actors an this rating of 10 is based on what this movie is: small cast, low budget film. I'm rating this in perspective and not rating it the sand I would a new marvel film. That said, the actors are nothing to write home about and the film terribly broke a couple of it's own plot features but I'm ok with it. I've watched so many Netflix and original sci fi films with smaller casts and budgets and I really can't think of any that left an impression. So many are all the same: attempt to be cerebral, move the plot along at a snail's pace, then hopefully end the film with a big reveal that it's almost guaranteed to be predictable even when the writer attempts so do otherwise. This film had great plot milestones and honestly had some reveals or story arcs that were quite interesting. For me to be able to ignore a few plot holes and get past some generic acting and still give the film a 10 on the b movie scale it means they did great with what they had. I hope the writer and/or director sticks with the genre and gets a real budget to try something bigger. I wish movies were rated more based on their genre or at least in comparison to what they are trying to be .I didn't find this movie from watching big top dollar trailers to find out it was just a decent b movie at best. I found out about it from other reviews and comments about it actually pulling off a good story for being a low budget film and I agree. Let's reward films that are fed to us in an appropriate way that deserves it so that the writers and directors can go on to give us bigger and better. However if this was a marvel film or a studio attempted to hide the fact it was a low budget B movie by spending a ton on trailers and tricking us into the box office I would have rated it a 5 at best.",Time Trap

It seemed like a fairly straightforward teen sci-fi flick starting out, then threw in some unexpected twists that had me trying to figure out where the story would take me next. That doesn't happen often for me, so kudos for that!The ending had me wondering if I'd somehow stumbled across the first movie adaptation of some 3 or 4 part YA book series I hadn't heard of before.As the credits started to roll, I said, 'What a cool movie.'

But in practice, if the people of our time failed to communicate with the cave mans.

871,epipboland,'\_('-')_/' ?,1,15 November 2018,"Um...
What a dull movie. For a budget of this kind, it looks cheap and uninspired. The whole premise of the time trap in a cave is cool, but this film completely misses the huge opportunity and it goes nowhere. It lacks emotion in characters and in the writing, and the acting didn't help either. Plot and story are never consistent. Certain plot holes weren't answered and didn't matter at the end, so what was the point. It also didn't need to be 90 minutes. The longer run time actually ruined the pacing and made the rest of the movie boring. Wish it was shorter, like at least 40 minutes. The shorter, the better. Misleading trailer also. Just, why.Could go on, but it's not worth it. There are better movies that have a lower budget than this that have time travel elements. Recommend watching those instead.",Time Trap

I feel like when movie is like this, there is a lot of leeway when done right. (decent characters & acting, good effects, interesting story). Good directing I would say as well.

Now i take that decission because of that movie.It is really not so bad... Very interesting idea but ""Something is wrong here"" as one of the characters sayed...It looks like a student project.
So many things with acting are wronng...
The problem is not only the budget of the movie. Many times i stay and think about how is possible such a mistakes do be done in such a project...Poor acting 3/4 of the time.Proffesor is 20 meters from the well of youth but he decide that he have only 5 minutes life left and can't wait someone to bring him water or to crawl just a little more...Fight scenes are comically
The advanced human was dramaticly beaten from a Neanderthal... WTF years of evolution, modern weapons and technology.. Fallen by Neanderthal...
If the fight scene was better made maybe will be some sence...One of the girls says ten times ""Seriously"" in inaccurate moment (poor dialogues)Professor search the cars and how is possible not to see that something is wrong and the cars are whole in plants and rusty ..... Now like abandoned before 1 hour... But he speak to someone that he expect to be at the next corner and listen to him...A lot of silly things...
