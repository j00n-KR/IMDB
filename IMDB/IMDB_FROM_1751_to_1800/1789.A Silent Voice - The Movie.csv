0,TheLittleSongbird,The consequences of bullying,8,23 November 2017,"Have always been a big fan of anime, particularly Studio Ghibli and Miyazaki without restricting myself to just them (some of my favourites are actually without either involved).Any film dealing with bullying and its consequences deserves to be applauded for the effort. Bullying, often stemming from something that should be a non-issue but turns out to be an easy target for bullies (for examples if your parents disallow you to play a popular video game for obvious reasons, if you have a posh accent, if you listen to and perform classical music, if you have a physical or social disability, false rumours spread about you, if you were a hard-worker rather than somebody who messed about and disrespected substitute teachers) is something that is very much relevant still and has damaging effects, it is an issue that needs to be addressed and acted upon much more than it is. This is coming from somebody who suffered merciless bullying myself in school, for all the above reasons apart from the first (in my case my school did nothing about it too), and nearly a decade on it has damaged my confidence/self-esteem, made me feel worthless and made my already bad anxiety worse despite getting a degree in music and singing regularly.So as one can probably tell, 'A Silent Voice' really resonated with me on an emotional level. At the same time, it also really made me think and see that there is much more to the issue, the bully, the witnesses and the victim than one would tend to perceive. 'A Silent Voice' also turned out to be a very good film in its own right. It isn't flawless, some of the supporting characters are under-explored and in a few cases inconsistently and one-dimensionally written and some of the story jumps around and doesn't always feel complete.Despite being over two hours, didn't think it was too long considering the number of characters and their stories. If anything, perhaps 'A Silent Voice' would have been even better as a series which would have solved the problems.On the other hand, 'A Silent Voice' has an awful amount to recommend. Great isn't a strong enough word to describe the animation. Rich in meticulous background and character detail, atmospheric and ethereal in colour schemes and alive to nuances in its use of settings and character gestures and expressions, it becomes a character of its own and there are some memorable images throughout like towards the end. The music has whimsy, haunting beauty and understatement, while not overbearing the drama and letting it speak when needed. The song is catchy.The writing is thought-provoking and contemplative, doing it in a way that will make bullying victims and those who bullied alike identify with what is said. A lot of it is remarkably insightful, and even when the film was really resonating with me it taught me a lot about an issue that isn't as black and white as perceived. The story has its issues but has a strong emotional core, with the truly powerful and touching ending leaving me shell-shocked.Not often does one find themselves rooting for a bully as well as the victim, 'A Silent Voice' is one of those rarities. The voice acting is dynamic.In summary, not perfect but very well done. 8/10 Bethany Cox",A Silent Voice - The Movie
1,classicsoncall,"""What does it mean to become someone's friend?""",8,19 September 2020,"I can see how this movie would resonate with teens and slightly older young adults. I would have found it quite absorbing fifty years ago when I would have fit that category. It covers a lot of the topics that frustrate young people today, like anxiety, depression, bullying and even thoughts of suicide. These are a hallmark of teens who feel they don't fit in and desperately attempt to connect with someone or something that would give meaning to their lives. I think the story made it's point well before it finally ended, thereby dragging out a theme beyond the two hour mark when it could have spared a handful of disconnected and disjointed scenes. The film makers utilize an interesting dynamic with the use of X's to cover the faces of virtually everyone in Shôya Ishida's sphere of influence, which illustrates the alienation he feels in his day to day existence. The X's only fall away when he makes a meaningful contact with that person, thereby opening up the possibility of friendship. It does take the entire picture for Shoya to achieve his 'a-ha' moment where he learns he doesn't have to be afraid, though it took a near death experience to finally get there. The character of Shoko Nishimiya also occupies a significant part of the story as a deaf girl who would like to be friends with Shoya, but misunderstandings as early as grade school stand in the way until Shôya embarks on his path of redemption for the grievances he caused as a young awkward bully himself. The title of the picture not only relates to the presence of Shoko, but in a way, may aptly describe the inner voice that helps Shôya to eventually find his way.",A Silent Voice - The Movie
2,Tweekums,A Silent Voice,10,29 August 2019,"This anime film from Kyoto Animation is centred on Ishida Shouya. As the film opens he is a high school student contemplating suicide; he stops at the last moment and we learn how he came to this point. When he was in elementary school a deaf girl named Shoko Nishimiya joins his class; she is bullied by several of her new classmates; Ishida being the worst. Eventually he goes too far; the class is asked about the bullying and they put all the blame on Ishida. Soon afterwards Shoko transfers. The years pass and Ishida has become isolated from his class. He learns sign language and finds Shoko so he can apologise and try to make amends. It won't be easy though; there are those who believe he is just doing it to make himself feel better and Shoko has her own feelings of guilt.If you come into this expecting the laughs that most school based anime provide you will be in for a shock; there may be plenty joyous moments and some laughs but there are a lot of down beat elements. This includes a very real depiction of the bullying of Shoko; Ishida's treatment of her is cruel but we see others pushing him on, laughing at what he does or just failing to say anything... and the fact that the others fail to see what they did wrong after Ishida is called out and eventually sees that he was wrong. As the story develops it is impossible not to sympathise with Ishida; his early behaviour may have been despicable but his attempts to make amends are genuine and he has improved more as a person than others involved. The characters are all very believable, even the twist involving Shoko's new 'boyfriend' is believable and rather fun. The animation is of a high quality with good character designs and impressive backgrounds. Overall I'd definitely recommend this film to anybody who enjoys an issue based drama... just be prepared to shed a few tears; of both sadness and joy.These comments are based on watching the film in Japanese with English subtitles.",A Silent Voice - The Movie
3,Irishchatter,"A film that will make you cry, angry and full of hope",8,17 March 2018,"I tell ya, this was one of the hardest anime film I have ever watched. I was literally so angry at Shôya and Ueno for throwing away Shoko's eight hearing aids (nearly nine when Ueno did try again to throw away Shokos hearing aids). They really were such bullies that if either of them were my children, I would definitely give them great punishment that would wake them up for the rest of their lives. I actually was really glad that Shoyas mother took money out of his bank account and paid Shokos mother. You would definitely feel sorry for Shoko, she was so badly picked on because of who she was as a deaf person. I don't know anyone personally who is deaf but unfortunately, I am sure bullying regarding deaf people exists and its just not fair for them because they didn't ask for it. It really is sad the world we live in. I was even glad this wasn't a romance this time, normally I would say the main characters should be together but in this film, it would be better off to not have Shoko and Shoya to be together romantically. I mean, I really wish Shoya didn't have to meet him again for the way he treated her, although I feel sorry for him that he is thinking of suicide, so is Shoko. It is definitely not a nice feeling when you bullied someone, you are full of guilt and you meet them again with regret hanging over you. That's why I think it would be better to not have the pair of them meet together again. Its a really good film too despite its very sad concept. It really does wake you up to wanting to help someone who is bullied and is in need of support from a friend. Bullying always needs to stop, please help someone who is in need of help folks <3",A Silent Voice - The Movie
4,westsideschl,Worthy of More,7,11 June 2019,"Story wise it's worthy of more stars. Not only a story about school bullying, insecurities, power posing, but also how we sometimes treat people who are different or even disabled (or enabled from another perspective). One line from the movie conveys this positive message, ""You can change, start now.""
The lower rating is because Japanese animations are of lower quality than what is possible, and because they tend to idealize & fictionize the appearances of teens (especially sexualize females) unrealistically.",A Silent Voice - The Movie
5,Reno-Rangan,A second chance to fix the past mistake.,7,14 July 2017,"This is the next best anime in the recent time after 'Your Name'. Not that you know this director very well, not at the international level. But with a film like this, she's going to be. This is another teen romance. Well, romance is not exactly a word that matches with what this film is about narrative, but there's no other way to describe its theme. It was like before romance, that mean before committing to a relationship and after you had started to like someone while fixing the mistakes made in the past.It's a high school tale. Before that, it opened with a brief flashback of the elementary school events, where Shoya Ishida bullied a new admission Shoko Nishimiya for her hearing impairment. Soon after that, she'd transferred to another school. Now, a few years later, they meet again in the high school, where Ishida tried to fix what he had done wrong a while ago for her. So a relationship develops, despite people around them does not understand their commitment. At some point, it will be tested, which might lead to uncover their true feeling to one another.This is surely aimed at the teen audience. Especially, the romance and sentimental parts are intended for the youngsters, but anyone would enjoy it. So, I felt them, but not like I'm still young. Otherwise, I would have said it is a masterpiece. That's only from the story perspective. The sketches and animations were not bad. The film characters were awesome. Each one was very unique and different people pick different characters as their favourite. I liked Yuzuru as I always like tomboyish type roles. But obviously Ishida and Shoko make this film.❝Please don't make such a serious face. And, let me say... I am sorry.❞Smooth animation. Technically comparable with any big names (anime titles). That also means the director is now in the league of the best anime-maker. She's young and I hope she keeps doing more films. As I said many times before, that after Hayao Miyazaki retired from making films, we need more people like this filmmaker to fill that empty space. The film won many awards for its great achievement, as well as box office success in the domestic market. Expecting the rest of the world and anime fans to receive it at the same extent.It was originally based on the manga of the same name, and a television series was made before this feature anime. As I collect film quotes, the best ones, I was disappointed on that context. There were many emotionally and romantically appealing lines, but not on the moral perception. That does not mean the film lacks the social consciousness. In fact, the film highlights the bullying and its severe consequences. That alone is enough, this is a must see for the school kids.Surely kids, teens and some youngsters would love it, but as far as the adults, this is not an ideal thematic, yet you can't ignore its artistry and the intention of the film. Sometimes it might help you to like it in the second viewing. Because this is one of those kind. My issue was understanding the Japanese sign language. Besides, the subtitle for that was not much helpful, as it was exactly translated as what the hearing impaired character babbled which is an alternate spelling for every word and sentence.I had lots of fun watching it, as well as other moods like romantic, touching, annoyance, but overall it leans towards the good side. Just over two hours, it never looked too slow or hurried in the story or the character developments. Could be the best to pick as a date flick or get together with your school friends, particularly opposite sex friends. My final saying is, it is not to be missed for many reasons I've mentioned in this review and the other one is it being an anime, a quality one.7/10",A Silent Voice - The Movie
6,briancham1994,Very grim,6,5 June 2020,"This film has a very serious tone as it is about very serious topics. Usually I don't mind that, but it became a bit too depressing for me. The character animation and voice acting were good - I definitely can't fault the film for how it was made. I guess the problem is that while this film is quite emotional, there's really only one emotion and it left me feeling down.",A Silent Voice - The Movie
7,pennyelenabooks,Good enough,7,19 May 2017,"A silent voice is an anime focusing more on the social perspective of the story, and less on the romance, if there is a romantic story to begin with that is. The issues that it's handling are powerful, giving the point of view of the bully, who was turned into the victim and eventually changed all together to become friends with the girl he was bulling. The anime explores the journey from being an outcast to finally reaching the point where the boy understands his victim, understands his friends and the people he hates and opens up to the world. Unlike the manga, it doesn't focuses too much on the girl, who struggles to feat in due to her disability, but more on the boy's life and social circles. Sure, there were some things left out, but, at least for me, the main battle of presenting the sign language in an anime was won. So, 7 out of 10.",A Silent Voice - The Movie
8,TheMovieDiorama,A Silent Voice encapsulates a deafening amount of humanity that grants bullying a path to redemption.,9,4 August 2019,"There's nothing more cruel and twisted than a bully destroying the life of an innocent, just because of how different they are to everyone else. Having, well had, a deaf family member allowed this tragic high school drama to shroud me in a wave of familiarity. Not necessarily due to the absence of a human sense and how to deal with it, but the actions of bullying that I myself may have delivered to others at a naively young age.Yamada and Kyoto Animation have produced one of the finest modern anime features in the last decade, enough to make me realise my erroneous judgements and how they have affected my so-called friends at the time. After nearly committing suicide, Shoya reflects back to his elementary school days where he bullied a young Shoko for her deafness. Having realised his insensitive approach, he attempts to make amends by befriending her and apologising.This review may get personal, apologies in advance. Watching bullying makes me physically wretch. No one should be afflicted with that much pain and solidarity for being themselves. I've realised that for so long, believe me, as I myself was a bully. I even contacted my ""friend"" a few years ago to apologise profusely. But quite rightly, I received no response. Just an indication that it had been ""read"". In this story, Shoya represents me. So to witness the first act, whilst shedding a few tears almost instantly, was a hard-hitting yet tantalisingly emotional experience. The verbal, physical and downright inhumane abuse that Shoko received was enough to make me look away.Overwhelmed with tainted reminiscence, Yoshida does not shy away from the original manga's poignant message. Transforming a grotesque bully into the sympathetic protagonist was always going to be tough. The audience has to feel his weakened mentality and earnest personality into wanting to right the wrongs he caused. Yoshida wrote every single character with a colossal amount of humanity. Never did it feel artificial, his longing for redemption. Never did it exhume desperation, the suicidal tendencies for the sake of melodrama. Never did it feel forced, the tangible romance blossoming between Shoya and Shoko. Beautifully written, gorgeously realised and touchingly human. The medium of anime rarely exceeds this level of writing. The sheer realism embedded within the animation made me weep tears atleast four times. Heck, I'm getting emotional just writing about the film! God damn!Kyoto Animation have really outdone themselves in terms of capitalising on the source material's drawing style. Simply put, the animation was stunning. Faultless. From the majestic urban backdrop amidst a fireworks show, metaphorically symbolising the explosive fluctuating nature of mental instability, to the wonderfully drawn character models that expressively exhume a variety of emotions. Yamada intricately orchestrated the animation to create a frenetic narrative structure, complete with time shifts and illusory visions, alluding to the haphazard thinking during times of solitude. Arguably too frantic at the best of times, especially with abrupt scene transitions, but overall very well edited by Shigemura who utilises ripples to explore the vibrational impact of character actions.The outstanding cinematography that creatively harnessed human body parts to reveal feelings, most notably legs, was memorable to say the least. Absolutely stunning. Intuitive details, for example implanting crosses on the faces of school peers that Shoya is outcasted by, further explored this idea of solitude. And rest assured, Yoshida never ventured into unnecessary melodrama. At no point did I feel forced to like Shoya, just because he wanted to walk down the path of redemption. It was all natural progression. The romance that carefully grows between Shoya and Shoko was exceptionally-well executed. The conclusion could've been cut tighter after the coma, however the film primarily revolved around Shoya as a character-changing venture, it was only fair the ending focused on him too. Oh, and the English dub wasn't irritating! Initially I had qualms with the deafened voice of Shoko, and aside from the crying, it was handled with earnest care.The same can be said for the entirety of this anime feature. No matter if the story is relatable to the viewer or not, it is irrefutably beautiful. You will laugh. You will smile. And yes, you will cry. It's a journey that expressively explored every emotion available, and I can safely say it's a near-masterpiece.",A Silent Voice - The Movie
9,SAMTHEBESTEST,Good but nothing great to be called out..,6,12 September 2020,"A Silent Voice (2016) :
Brief Review -Good but nothing great to be called out.. I think have a problem with foreign language animated films (LOL). Tell you why, most of the animated films i saw from IMDb Top Rated 250 films list have gone with Overrated Verdict. This is specifically for foreign language Films, rest i loved Hollywood Classics and adore it more than motion pictures. A Silent Voice is about a notorious boy who bullies a Deaf girl in School days. Years later, he feels bad for her and sets off on a path for redemption. This is a simple case of repentance and somewhere things like Friendship, Love, Philosophy of Life went half-cooked. The love story is left incomplete without any concrete ending, same goes to the philosophy of life and friendship motto. Rest, it completes the course of redemption and reaches the destination on that path. I am bit disappointed and reluctant looking at High Rating for this film on IMDb. This is good, definitely good but nothing great or something classy in Animated genre. However, it came in 2010's decade when Animated films had already moved way ahead technically, theoretically, practically and fundamentally. A Silent Voice is nothing unique, innovative or creative and anyways it is nothing big in writing itself then why the hell people made it look Giant? I am not in the league, sorry. A Silent Voice comes with little overlong runtime of 130 minutes when mostly such stories can be and have been wrapped up within 90 minutes more effectively. Naoko Yamada used nothing artistic or creatively amazing to tell this story of common characters hence simplicity works but nothing remains in memory. I would like to recommend other Hollywood animated Classics rather than this One time Good flick or on other side may be you should watch it and let me know if i missed something.RATING - 6/10*By - #samthebestest",A Silent Voice - The Movie
10,Vartiainen,The point of view of a bully,6,5 December 2019,"A Silent Voice is a movie about a young boy, who in his early school days starts to bully a deaf girl because of her disability, going so far as to cause her physical harm. Unintentionally, but still. This ends up haunting him, and some years later he looks her up, wanting to make amends and to relieve at least some of the guilt eating him.This is a fresh take on this issue. We've seen a million stories about those that are bullied. How they can overcome their experiences, how they can move past them, how they can even make their bullies understand the error of their ways. But in this film it's the bully who realizes on his own that he was wrong and wants to get better. Sure, it's not purely selfless because his friends end up abandoning him, not wanting to associate with a known bully, but we don't live in a vacuum and our motives are very rarely pure black or white.The characters are also interesting, quirky and identifiable. You end up caring for most of them, and what I really enjoyed was how none of them was perfect. They all had their flaws, major and minor, and even the more unpleasant characters you could see meeting in real life.Unfortunately the movie suffers from a very lazy pacing. It's over two hours long, when most of these anime films are something around hour and a half. And that length would have suited this film much better. There are a lot of scenes that are eerily similar with one another. A lot of the conversations and issues end up repeating themselves and by the end I was feeling real fatigue with the film.Still, it's definitely a film I could see myself recommending. For the fresh take on the subject matter, if nothing else. Personally I had problems with its length, but I can also see how someone could get so lost in these characters and their problems that they would not care at all.",A Silent Voice - The Movie

12,GiraffeDoor,Well this was an experience...,9,6 November 2020,"I've been meaning to review this for ages but I've been putting it off because I'm not sure where to start.When I first heard the premise, I had an immediate idea of how the plot would develop and how it would end. And I was basically right. It went exactly where I thought it would. However, when it reached the point that I thought would be the end, we were actually only one third of the way through.This is a movie that accepts no easy answers, it takes no short cuts and does not need you to meet it half way.An ambitious movie for sure, I've seen a ton of movies about alienated protagonists or characters dealing with bullies but never one where we get to see things from the bully's perspective and see a person deal with being the real bad guy with all the consequences. And these consequences are largely interpersonal not material.A story of redemption to an extent but I would be shortchanging it to not point out that it is so much more than that. It reminds of Anomalisa (so much keeps reminding me of Anomalisa) in how it uses slight but conspicuous stylization to represent visually how we perceive other and I know that sounds pretentious but this movie is anything but.It's hard to put this film's exact tone into words. It's breezy and restrained but with something powerful always simmering beneath the surface. That doesn't quite do it justice but that's the best I got. There's a fascinating attention to apparently trivial details like how the protagonist abuses his mechanical pencil (didn't we all?) and glimpses of the strange man who turns out to be the step-father. They're ultra-subtle about it but I think anxiety about his mother remarrying may have motivated his behavior to an extent.My point is that, watching this, I really felt I was looking into a real world with real people where even the minor characters feel like someone you could meet but there is still the same vibrancy that ol' Hayao wishes he could manage it the art direction.it's a movie that lingers in the mind for a long time afterword. There is an interesting amount of coincidences and there is so much you could discuss afterwards. It also serves as a frightening reminder of how far the Nipponese are willing to go to keep shoes touching carpets. Haven't they ever head of vacuuming?And the deaf girl (I never remember names), well I will say that she is adorable. I might have a deaf fetish now. She doesn't actually have much of a personality but that isn't a mark against the movie. It isn't really about her. She embodies a somewhat old fashioned vision of disabled people in that she has this Christ like level of benevolence, patience and forgiveness. Again, I'm not condemning the movie, it's just interesting.One more thing: did anyone else think the mother and the sister were the same person for a while?I think this is my 2nd favorite Japanimated movie so far, after Grave of the fireflies.",A Silent Voice - The Movie

Look I know Your Name is 2017's best anime movie but I have to disagree. Personally I think this movie shows teaches you how to deal with bullies, not to go into depression of killing your self and how you can seek redemption of your past mistakes.

17,Prashast_Singh,"Far from a romance, but closest to a moving, poignant redemption drama.",10,26 May 2021,"I initially wasn't very intrigued to watch it months ago thinking it would be a typical teenage romance, thanks to the incorrect descriptions available on several sites. But looking at a preview clip on Netflix and realizing it would leave the platform in about a week, I felt compelled to check it out even if it was actually a love story.It was a very poignant, moving drama about redemption instead.At first, I couldn't bring myself to identify with the protagonist Ishida and thought I was getting to see a typical bully character worth hating completely. This is where everything changed. His characterization was so powerful that although I could really never relate to the bullying part, I found myself slowly ignoring it seeing what his character developed into. Issues like anxiety, depression and social awkwardness were some I really related to. Moments of brotherly friendship tugged at my heartstrings, and Ishida's attempts to make amends with Nishimiya felt emotionally weighed. Other characters too, managed to feel relevant to the story and added depth wherever possible.The animation is rather simple given the storyline. There's not a lot of spectacle, but the overall visual appeal is pretty high for a drama. The voice acting is splendid, and just another reason I'd recommend watching it subbed. It's really surprising how I came to identify with a protagonist who did something terrible in the past but at the end of the day suffered from the same issues I and many other anxious people suffer from daily all over the world. And by the time the climax arrived, I realized I had seen a masterpiece, as a result of which I did not skip the end credits. This film will stick with me for quite some time. Nishimiya is such a pure character that her cute face would be hard to forget easily, and Ishida as a character will forever remain a bright example that while we humans can be quick to judge anyone, nobody in this world is completely good or evil, and all it takes is love and caring to change things forever.",A Silent Voice - The Movie
18,phanthinga,Koe no Katachi short review,10,15 May 2017,2017 is a good years for anime lovers around the world because after Kimi no na wa one of my favorite anime movie of all time we have a chance to witness Koe no katachi a anime that not only is the best example why we love anime but also can connects with each of us in a very personal level.Seriously i can't tell how many time my mouth open wide with pure shock and exited when some of the scene in the movie can relate so much to me and my life from just a little boy to a full adult today.The characters is very likable and very realistic from my view point when they deal with a lot of hardship in life that when from just a small decision to something that can literally change your personality and make your regret for the rest of your life.The anime also balance the comedy and drama very well so when a important scene happen you can easy follow and feel the same emotion of the characters.I bet after this anime anyone can learn a valuable lesson about life and can change to be a better version of yourself.Now had to read to manga right the way so you guys after read my review better buy a ticket and see this movie ASAP,A Silent Voice - The Movie
19,katyayan-12892,Excellent,9,23 March 2021,"Review By Kamal KKyoto Animation again brings great animation on to the table; The glittering eyes, cutesy-moe seifuku characters, great background, and much more. It is one of the finest animation quality out there, and if romance genre is your cup of tea, you will probably like the movie. Even if you don't like romance, it is not a disappointing film.The animation quality of Koe no Katachi is just tremendously amazing; Kyoto animation with a film budget definitely get things glittering don't they.This is a story about the importance of listening and the effects of not doing so. It something we can all understand and learn from.The plot evoked a roller coaster of emotions, some easy to emphasis with, and others MADE easy to resonate with! The plot starts vigorously but with a pace you could easily keep up with. It slightly stagnates to build context until the plot's climax - which got my spine tingling - a climax that I don't want to ruin for the unsuspecting! But the stagnation is what stops it from getting a 9/10 for it's plot. The strategic retreat from the plot's focus enabled for a good few laughs and set up what was to come very well, but it turned a 2 hours movie into what felt like a 3 hour movie, where I was anticipating the end mid way though as it seemed like they had reached a happily ever after. It somewhat ruined the experience for me and I felt like it could have been executed better by adding some more romantic develop (because I felt more pity for the characters than love
Social anxiety, Suicide, self loath/pity, forgiveness/acceptance, attachment, the desire/difficulty to be connect and most of all the complexity of human communication and emotions - all covered in this Movie as you delve into a journey to unravel a facade to find emotions we all contain and hide from others to void the difficulty of conveying them. We follow a character who closes his mind and refuses not to listen to create his own cynical narrative and in it we learn voice (koe) - or communication - has many shapes and forms (Katachi) and that it's shallow to think it's all monotonous.",A Silent Voice - The Movie
20,kjproulx,Probably The Best Anime Film Of 2017,9,16 October 2017,"When it comes to anime, I don't find myself watching nearly enough in order to form a list of favourites, but even if I had watched everything under the moon, I still believe A Silent Voice would make the list. This is a spectacular film from start to finish. Keep in mind, this can be a very tough film to sit through for multiple reasons, and that is exactly what I'm going to dive into throughout this review, because I feel that a few precautions should be taken when going in. Here is why A Silent Voice deserves to be seen by everyone, even though it won't please everyone.At its core, this film is about a new student that comes into a school, who just so happens to be hearing impaired. Ishida, the school bully, taunts her to the point of tears, for audiences as well. Without ruining the impact of certain scenes, I'll just say that his actions were quite Risqué. I found myself absolutely hating his character, which was very frustrating, due to the fact that the film asks you to sympathize with him on multiple occasions. After growing up and leaving his harsh ways in the past, these two characters reconnect, forming a highly unlikely bond. A Silent Voice asks for your acceptance almost too often, but trust me, if you're in the forgiving mood, this film turns out to be extremely powerful. So that's the warning I must give you, that if you're not ready to be forgiving of a terrible actions, I'd wait until you're in the right mood to watch this movie.Throughout Ishida's transformation from a bully to a kind-hearted human being, it wasn't just the dialogue that impacted me, but the visuals surrounding him. Every time he would pass by other people that knew him, they had X's on their face. When this aspect comes into play a little later in the movie, I'd be lying if I said it didn't move me. From beginning to hate the film for displaying a very unlikable character, this story really does a great job at winning you over, especially through it's silent, visual storytelling in the background, foreground, and even anytime that it makes it blatantly obvious.When a movie makes you wait for it to be really good, it can be a pretty frustrating experience, but I see something different when reflecting on this film. It's all about redemption and how forgiveness is everything when you truly want to become a better person that what you were in the past. Evil is all throughout everyone, but you're not supposed to act on it. This is one of the message that I feel the movie tries to convey and I believe it's a wonderful lesson to everyone. The themes presented throughout this film are taken very seriously, so I don't think it will appeal to a younger audience, but I think older teenagers will be the perfect demographic here, for the lesson it's giving.In the end, A Silent Voice is a film that had me hating throughout the first act, realizing I was wrong throughout the second act, and on the verge of tears throughout the third act, due to how well this movie does a complete 180. With a powerful story, a final sequences that will have many in tears, and an overall film that is worthy of awards, I can't recommend this enough. That being said, I can't get myself to give this movie a perfect score, due to the fact that I think it took a little too long to win me over. I found myself disliking the movie throughout the majority of it, until my eventual realization, which is my one warning, so I feel I won't be alone on that. A Silent Voice is one of the best movies I've seen so far this year.",A Silent Voice - The Movie

22,MrDHWong,A touching and affecting story of one's struggle for redemption,9,8 November 2017,"A Silent Voice is an anime drama film directed by Naoko Yamada (K-On!). Based on the manga of the same name by Yoshitoki Oima, it is a touching and affecting story of one's struggle for redemption.While he was in elementary school, Shoya Ishida, in an effort to fit in with his fellow peers, teased and bullied a deaf girl in class named Shoko Nishimiya. However, this backfires on Shoya and he ends up being shunned by the other students as Shoko ultimately ends up transferring elsewhere. Now in high school, Shoya has felt constant remorse for his actions and attempts make things right with both Shoko and the classmates who ostracised him.Poignant and beautifully animated, A Silent Voice is not only a well made anime film, but also an interesting commentary on the state of one's mental health and well-being. This film will likely strike a chord with anybody suffering from depression and/or anxiety who wish they could find a way to fix their past mistakes. Also, despite its serious tone, director Naoko Yamada still manages to insert some humorous and quirky comic relief at appropriate times, much in the vein of what was seen in K-On!, her previous work. The Japanese voice acting is solid, however it is Saori Hayami as the voice of Shoko Nishimiya who stands out the most. Her performance as a deaf girl was highly convincing and never seemed exaggerated or too comical. I have not yet seen the English dub but I plan to do so in the not-to-distant future.I rate it 8.5/10",A Silent Voice - The Movie
23,elicopperman,As Sincerely Hard-Hitting as it Gets,8,26 March 2020,"When approaching the subject of bullying and depression, there aren't many films that tackle said subject nearly as well A Silent Voice. Released in the middle of the 2010 decade, this film is often regarded as one of the most poetic looks into teenage harassment for its intriguing characters and themes of overcoming personal fears and hurdles. The main storyline revolves around a deaf grade school student named Shoko Nishimiya who is bullied mercilessly by Shoya Ishida, and years later in high school, he sets out to make amends with the girl.As a character, Shoya lost what it meant to truly feel like a human being due to his past bully persona and how it messed him up emotionally, which is something anyone can relate to growing up acting mean to others. It's through Shoko that his goal to be a better person becomes stronger and stronger, especially since she tries to live life with a smile on her face in spite of her past trauma and disdain for herself. The past can often hurt, but the way to overcome it is to make a better future and be the best human being you can be, even if you can't always please everyone. Through Shoya's teen years, he either makes new friends like the naive Tomohiro and Shoko's responsible sister Yuzuru, or former peers from his school who either bullied Shoko with Shoya or were genuinely kind to her. The most notable of these has to be Noaka, since she still holds a grudge towards Shoko for being different and is a great representation of people who refuse to grow past a certain point in their lives and continue harassing others to get their way, unlike the sincere people Shoya meets in his life.From a technical standpoint, the cinematography really ads a special colorful aesthetic to the visuals, especially since the movie is quite harmonious in how it displays the effects of childhood trauma and teen depression. While the scenes can often come off as a little too bright, the filmmakers still cleverly find subtle transitions between the past and present to show just how conflicting Shoya becomes to himself and the people around him. It almost feels like if the movie was live-action, all the rich beauty would be lost in a realistic environment, since animation is able to emulate the real world in ways that are more visually enticing than the common day lives of real humans. Also, the voice cast did a wonderful job bringing their characters to life through monotone line deliveries and distinctive characteristics. The little details in their voices, like Shoko's almost robotic sounding voice or Shoya's horrific gasps, are extra little bits of detail that help distinguish them from most leads in movies like this, providing a good amount of personality and even relatable gestures.Needless to say, A Silent Voice is one of the few teen dramas that manages to successfully blend pessimism and optimism through themes of isolation, bullying, mental health and growing up through honesty and care. Just because you made poor mistakes some time in your life doesn't mean you can never change, and arguably the best way to do that is acknowledging your past whilst progressing forward in becoming more friendly and sincere in your age. And yes, that may include accepting others for who they are on in the inside, regardless if they're impaired or not.",A Silent Voice - The Movie

Shoko has always been a character I've been able to somewhat relate to and look up to in a way. When the anime movie was first announced, I wasn't so keen on the idea. I didn't think they'd be able to fully create the same effect that the manga has, the same beautiful scenes and facial expressions that really capture the full heart of this story.I'm so glad I decided to watch it and at least try it out and see how it was.What Naoko Yamada did with the Koe no Katachi franchise is nothing short of amazing. You can feel just how much love went into this film, how much care was put into the frames. I don't think I caught any mistakes or goofs or any sight of any lazy drawing or animations.This is an utterly touching story on depression, writing your wrongs, friendship and a strong message that no matter what, you aren't alone. With tense scenes, beautiful heart-felt scenes that make you tear up and sniff, this is the utmost best that could have been created for the Koe no Katachi franchise. This film brings together all the handcrafted details that make this story as special as it is. Every second is crafted from nothing but pure love and attention to detail to create such an accurate and detailed story that leaves the viewer out of breath, in tears and with a fully warmed heart. As someone with impaired hearing, I could not have asked for better representation in Shoko and as someone with depression, I couldn't have asked for better representation than Ishida.If you haven't watched this yet, I highly recommend it.",A Silent Voice - The Movie
28,austin0731,"Follow up to the success of the hit anime ""Your name""",7,26 March 2017,"Following the success of ""Your name"" we now have the next successful anime that is currently sweeping the charts of Japanese and Asian box offices. ""A silent voice"" captures various mature and serious topics, packed into a wonderfully animated 2 hour feature. It deals with topics such as: social anxiety, fitting in, bullying, suicide, all such that wouldn't be expected in a teenage romance/drama anime that we were led to believe. No, a silence voice tries to capture a much broader idea with a reasonable amount success. Though the film has been heavily marketed to feature the female protagonist, a deaf girl she really isn't the centerpiece of this film, this film really takes a much more in depth look at our male protagonist, a bully. This is quite a refreshing view from the lens of someone on the other side of most modern day films and takes an unconventional look from a very interesting angle, while sidelining the romance as a brief sub-plot. This film at its core is about trying to fit in and the notion of being isolated but it was also highlighted that it was very important for one to get over their own guilt and to quite literally put in this film ""face the world again"".This film does best at capturing this atmosphere, the sense of mistrust and uncertainty towards others, the use of literal crosses on the characters that our protagonist encounters to represent his own lack of self confidence and fear of social interactions was a very good stylistic choice in my opinion. This film is however flawed mostly in the development of character, many of the secondary characters and even in some cases the main characters are quite poorly developed, many secondary characters come out of nowhere and their motives are very much unknown to the audiences and sometimes plain irrational, I understand that it was a very important thing that within this group of friends each character represents their own flaws however because of this lack of development these characters grow to be rather irritating and distracting, detracting from the overall narrative at various times. These character flaws can be understood due to the fact that this is an adaptation of a manga series and it should noted that it attempts to cram in way too much information resulting in such complications.",A Silent Voice - The Movie

30,TheOny13,Just don't get all the fuss around this movie...,5,31 August 2019,"I was looking forward to this movie since everyone has been praising it for beeing even better than ""Your Name"". Having seen it, that comparison makes me puke!Once the movie started I was immediately captured by the interesting plot and the appearance of the deaf little girl. Then the bully starts bullying her and the way the movie handels that is somewhat cliched. He just bullies her and the movie cuts from scene to scene without showing any proper motivation for the ""Shoya"" character. Then the movie cuts after a few years... don't know how much since the people who made this movie didn't bother to let me know... and we meet Shoya after the events that were shown in the beginning of the movie (which let you to believe it was a clever scene from the end placed at the beginning like in ""Your Name"". Not the case here anyway) as he finds Shoko again and asks her to be friends again. That was again a very nice and touching scene. But that is where the movie broke from for me. It brings characters that are older that apparently were in the same class as Shoya and hopes I would remember all of them of care about them at this point in the movie, when I'm more interested in the dynamic between Shoko and Shoya. From there the movie became so boring for me. I was constantly asking myself ""what good does this and this and this scene for the movie?"" and aside from other 3 fine scenes: the first where Shoko tries to tell Ishida that she loves him (more about that later), the second where Shoko jumps and Shoya saves her only to fall himself down in the river and the bridge scene at the end, I was bored almost to tears by this movie. I know it tried to depict depression and the way people feel when they are being bullied but the movie could have portrayed that in a more smooth way.
Then comes my biggest issue with this movie, and that is the relationship between Shoka and Shoya. At one point as I mentioned she even tries to tell him that he loves him, giving him three sticks with some shapes on them. By the end of the movie when Shoya sees those sticks back home with his little sister, she and his mom tell him what they mean, at that point I was ""hey maybe the movie is doing something with this relationship, having Shoya figuring out that Shoka tried to tell him that she loved him and then maybe trying to go see her and say the same thing or something like that"". No, the movie just forgets about that scene, never mentions it and the movie ends with him finally being able to look people in the face. There was literally no reward for all the relationship they builded between Shoka and Shoya. Wouldn't that have been great if they became lovers after having so much trouble in the beginning. Also not to mention that the character turnaround in the beginning for Shoya was completely unbelievable although there were singns when he was bullying Shoka that inside he was regretting. He literally transforms in a mater of a transition from a scene to another scene.I'm sorry but this is my opinion on this movie. I really wanted to be touched, inspired and moved by this movie, like I was by Your Name but apart from some truly wonderful scenes that somewhat touched me, I never got the feeling that I was fulfilled by the end with how the movie wrapped itself up, Wouldn't recomend this movie, especially if you've seen Your Name. 5/10",A Silent Voice - The Movie
31,overwatchgengi,A Film From the Perspective of a Bully,9,27 November 2020,A Silent Voice is an anime movie with many layers to its characters. The story is simple but is made complex through the characters themselves. The writing is excellent and the voice acting makes the dialogue feel even better.

34,Shostakovich343,A Silent Voice,6,7 September 2020,"Some films have to be put under a microscope to distinguish their flaws. Others show them in a matter of minutes. In the case of ""A Silent Voice"", it suffices to glance at the running time: 2 hours and 10 minutes. That is about as long as ""Princess Mononoke"", and ""A Silent Voice"" does not feature a battle between four armies and a forest god.Instead, the film tells the story of one boy, Ishida, attempting to atone for his past sins. It begins in primary school, when a girl named Nishimiya joins his class. She is deaf and can only communicate through distorted syllables and sign language. Ishida discovers it is a hoot to make fun of her disability in front of his classmates. Before long he finds himself a bully.These early scenes are by far the strongest. You watch Ishida destroy himself as much as the girl he bullies, and realise how rarely we view these stories from the bully's perspective. Especially powerful is the moment when Ishida is called out for throwing away Nishimiya's hearing aids. The scope of the damage he has done finally gets through to him when his already poor family has to pay damages to Nishimiya's. He decides to apologise the next day, but Nishimiya is gone.Years later, Ishida has become a shadow of his former self. He is convinced his new classmates shun him for what he has done. (They all wear crosses over their eyes.) But when he re-encounters Nishimiya he has the chance to make up for the past. They spend the rest of the film coming to terms with what happened and where they are now, and again the effect is twofold: He seeks her forgiveness as much as his own.Sounds good, doesn't it? It is, but there's more. A lot more. There is so much going on in ""A Silent Voice"" that I am challenged to even summarise it. Ishida disconnects, reconnects, re-disconnects, and re-reconnects with his friends. He has troubles with his family. He has troubles with Nishimiya's family. Nishimiya has troubles with her family. She has her own friends to reconnect with. Six schoolmates enter the picture. Two day trips are made. Someone dies. Two people attempt suicide. And that's just the Cliffs Notes.Let's zoom out for a moment. This story needed two characters to work: Ishida and Nishimiya. Nothing but the two of them would have made for a nice 45-minute short. But nobody watches shorts, so we need more. Add a few complications and a side plot or two and we have 1 hour and 30 minutes -- perfect for an intimate story like this.But that wasn't the writing process of ""A Silent Voice"". It seeks to adapt a 62-chapter manga, and it shows. Most of the time the film appears to be written the same way as Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy: by taking the bible-sized complete text and ripping out pages until something of reasonable length is left.2 Hours and 10 minutes, however, is still not a reasonable length. As the emperor told Mozart: 'There are simply too many notes.' And contrary to said emperor, I know which ones to cut. Prune the tangle of subplots and side-characters by about 60% and you will have a more than decent drama. Forgiving viewers evidently love the film as is, but if this is your first time going in, I'd recommend bringing gardening equipment.",A Silent Voice - The Movie

The movie tackles many life problems and shows characters creating solutions that unfold in many different ways. Not only this but the movie looks incredible! All the small details work extremely nicely to build the world. The characters are of course the centre point of the film, and they are amazing, they are written extremely well and the development of these characters is well paced and just terrific to watch. Now I don't really have many negatives, maybe that the timing was off and about half way through the plot seemed to lack a sense of direction...but in the end it all works out brilliantly and becomes incredibly emotional. I do think that the ending wasn't quite as emotional as something that takes place earlier in the film.

38,Mara-Jade-Skywalker-23,Amazing Anime,10,6 August 2019,"""A Silent Voice"" is simply an astonishing film. A movie that deals with themes of bullying with serious maturity. And even though I wasn't bullied in school, I can still appreciate the movie for that.The movie centers around a man who in elementary bullied a deaf girl (Shoko) until she moved away. Now, several years later, he attempts to redeam his actions. The movie deals in heavy themes of bullying and suicide in a way no other has, as well as in a very grounded and believable way. As we sympathize with the main character, following him on his journey. As in the beginning, he was simply unaware of how much damage he was doing to her, and not understanding her. But once he realized that, she had moved away. From there, his friends shun him, and he becomes an outcast, unable to look at people in the eyes, has trouble communicating with people, and even contimplating suicide.It's a very real depiction of how actions can change people. And during his plan on suicide, he decides to tie up every loose end, including giving Shoko her notebook back (the one she communicated with), and also apologizing for everything, and asking they can be friends. However, after giving it back, his plans on suicide change.The supporting characters are also great, but underdeveloped. And that's my only gripe.I also really like the animation. From the character models, to the lighting, to the backgrounds, it's beautiful to look at, and doesn't dissapoint.The movie is an emotional, heart-wrenching masterpiece. A movie that does something new by following the bully, and not the victim. As we follow his journey, his regret, and his tramatic expierences. And excellently unconventional romance, and just a damn good movie, a movie that really surprised me. It's a movie better than most, and in my opinion, maybe the best anime film.",A Silent Voice - The Movie

42,valen060,Quest for Repentance and Finding Life's Meaning,9,30 December 2017,"Words alone cannot describe how much I was hooked onto this dramatic story.'Koe no Katachi' (or A Silent Voice) revolves around Shoya, a 12-year-old boy in junior high who is at odds with a disabled girl named Shoko in his class since she is unable to speak clear sentences and can only use Sign Language to communicate. When one of his teasings finally gets out of hand, it affects his social life greatly as an older teen. Hoping to seek redemption and repent over his past, he finds Shoko again years later and tries to make amends for himself and those he hurt.After seeing Makoto Shinkai's 'Your Name,' I see what Shinkai meant when he described this film as an interesting piece of work that he cannot easily replicate. Creator Yoshitoki Oima and director Naoko Yamada sure brought these characters to life with both depth and emotion. Even with the use of Sign Language, it has this sense of realism as it's being shown. The imagery involving physical abuse, suicide, and inner turmoil were things I couldn't imagine be pulled off this dramatically well in an anime film. For a runtime of a little over two hours, it's definitely a must-see from beginning to end. Whether you're into Japanese animation or not, the story is what really matters as it can pertain to real-life as well.Shoya's predicament had me reflecting on my own life at a young age too. Through pride and vanity comes damaging repercussions on one's own outlook. I had my share of regrets and if I could take any of them back, I wouldn't hesitate. It sure had me thinking of the social follies in some people.The moral: The past cannot be changed, but discover that there's more to life than just hurting those around oneself by starting anew.",A Silent Voice - The Movie
43,A_Llama_Drama,devastating and beautiful anime,10,21 August 2020,"A Silent Voice (or ""The Shape of a Voice"") is a great addition to the ""slice of life"" anime of modern times. At times life affirming in its quieter moments, at other times shocking in its depiction of Japanese teen life.Egged on by his school mates, Shoya bullies the newly arrived Shoko, who happens to be deaf. Perceived to be receiving special treatment, and being different (a crime in Japanese society), Shoko is fair game for any number of cruelties. Until it goes too far.This movie then takes a different approach. Instead of showing the bullied person's return to strength, it shows the traumatised bully (and his cohorts) as he seeks to recover from the horror he put Shoko through. You may balk at the thought, but the paths of Shoya and Shoko are explored in their later high school lives, both being treated sympathetically.The animation is beautiful, the script manages to avoid typical Japanese cliche, and the story takes some shocking turns without relying on trite misery or emotional manipulation.

I would have liked for example, if it have given more time to explore Naoka Ueno's character, which I found as the most realistic one of the bunch.To sum up, a lot of people seem to love this movie, so you probably should give it a try, but to that I would attach a trigger warning, if you were the victim of abuse as a child or if you know someone who was.",A Silent Voice - The Movie

53,sildarmillion,Understanding yourself. Loving yourself.,9,6 June 2020,"I found this quite different from the other anime movies I've seen. Most of the ones I've seen involve archetypes. But this one focused in-depth on character. While there is a clear protagonist, Shoya Ishida, the film is a character study of a bunch of high school kids. Sometimes I feel like the complex emotions they were going through and how they were handling it were much too much for high school kids, but let's roll with it.A huge theme among what all of the kids were feeling was a sense of worthlessness. The present day of the film deals with the repercussions of elementary school whence the deaf girl was bullied in school. Shoko Nishimiya, the deaf girl, seemed at first to be the angelic archetype, who was ever-forgiving and always trying to befriend her tormentors. But she suffers from deep-seated self-blame and views herself as causing all the problems around her. Shoyo Ishida bullied her at first, and later when he was heavily chastised, he got bullied himself, and eventually ostracized. And he also develops some of that nihilism that Shoko Nishimiya suffered from. This is probably why they are able to connect and understand each other as they start to become friends.But then there are other characters also involved with the bullying. Naoka Ueno can't stand Shoko Nishimiya's apologizing because part of her does feel the guilt. Miki Kawai may not have directly bullied anyone, but she participated in it just the same, but she denies she did anything wrong and gets intensely upset at any accusation. These were the two that stand out. And these two are among the group of kids who have to learn to accept their faults and learn to love themselves despite those faults. Although this is the challenge with which Shoyo and Shoko both have the hardest time. And while they make progress, they're not necessarily all the way there by the end of the movie. But when I say much too much for high school kids, I think the progress that they do make was progress many adults don't make. Maybe I'm not giving them enough credit, but I'm glad they made all that progress for the sake of a cathartic experience for the viewer.I was expecting a cheesy romance like Studio Ghibli's Whisper of the Heart...or you know any Studio Ghibli movie that treats love between children as epic romances. But this was a grounded tale, which focused on the importance of self-growth and self-love. And it was a truly touching film.",A Silent Voice - The Movie

55,salinaqvi,Redeem Yourself,8,13 May 2020,"A Silent Voice tells the tale of a redemption as a man tries to right the wrongs he committed to a deaf girl in his past. The movie weaved his tale of redemption, as he comes to terms of what he did and the actions he is undertaking to rectify it, in a way few movies have been capable of pulling off. The emotion that resonates from the film is outstanding as you truly do feel all the thoughts and emotions of the characters that all culminates in a superb ending. And the relationship between the girl and the boy was done excellently with all the runtime being used effectively to tell their story. This is a movie of emotion and of love and if you're looking to feel that, then this is the movie for you.",A Silent Voice - The Movie

I learnt about this movie yesterday by accident and though the animation looked cute and the summary was interesting. I decided to watch this two hour movie after work. I was crying throughout from the beginning to the end. Anyone who has been a victim of bullying, dealt with depression, attempted or contemplated suicide, felt like an unnecessary burden to their loved ones, who felt ostracized, suffered from loneliness, felt like a loser, suffered from social anxiety, tried to maintain a perfect facade, or had done an act so cruel it haunts you for the rest of your life, then you could relate to this movie. I warn you, you're going to cry and I'm not a crybaby myself. Two minutes after this movie ends, you're going to still be thinking about it. Don't go in thinking it's a romance.

I found myself rooting for Shoko and eventually Shoya as well. I think this movie should be a requirement for children in school, as it shows the consequences of bullying and that there is redemption even for a bully.Obviously, the writing in this is great, as well as the animation.My only qualm with this movie was some confusion over the flashbacks. The way some scenes were cut together made it hard to decipher exactly what was happening or what had happened. This is a Japanese film so maybe this confusion has something to do with it being translated for English audiences? Either way, this confusion didn't hinder the movie too much and it was still very enjoyable to watch.I would recommend this movie a hundred times over!",A Silent Voice - The Movie

The two main characters were both very well developed and were placed inside of a great narrative. This movie gets very sad at some points. It's very emotional effective although I didn't cry. (Keep in mind no movie has actually made me cry as of yet). I genuinely didn't know where the story was going. It's not like there were a bunch of twists or turns, I'm just saying it wasn't necessarily predictable. Also another thing that impressed me was how defined the side characters were as well. I liked all of them and they all had unique traits, except there was this one guy who just came out of nowhere and wasn't interesting in the slightest. Forget his name, but he had red hair. The one problem I did have with it wasn't really the movies fault it's just that the version I was watching didn't have subtitles for the sign language. So that was annoying but despite that the film still works incredibly well. Oh I also forgot to mention that the animation is beautiful. This movie is just on the verge of being a 10.

71,diffguy,Scratches that emotional itch,7,8 February 2021,"I went into this hoping to get emotionally wrecked, and while the film didn't tear me down to my core like others have, it did enough to satisfy me.The film deals with once-in-a-lifetime emotions like suicide or the trauma of causing someone else's death or losing all of your friends because of your own selfish actions. These events are all transformative to our sense of self, and we become different people because of it. The characters reflect this real life phenomena in a believable way. I could relate with what they were going through easily because of how well they portrayed them.The story is heavy with a lot to unpack. And that's unfortunately a shortcoming - they throw these once-in-a-lifetime emotions at you so quickly that there isn't adequate time to distill them or let the characters explore it. I still felt the weight of their emotional experience, but it was a bit hollow, and could have been improved as a series with double the runtime. Conversely, the story could have been improved if they removed most of the secondary characters except Yuzuru and Nagatsuka and focus on those main 4. They were the most compelling and deserved to be fleshed out more.Another shortcoming - which may be caused by English translation of the Japanese audio - was that a lot felt missing from the scenes. Either the translation was severely lacking in accuracy and added context, or A Silent Voice too heavily relies on the viewer to just understand what the flashbacks and symbolism and dialogue mean.",A Silent Voice - The Movie

74,TVpotatoCat,Boring and not very realistic,2,27 April 2020,"There were a few things that I didn't like in this movie.
I would expect a drama to be more realistic than any other genre but it's not really the case here. Unfortunately, in the reality we live in most people wouldn't care if they bullied someone. But in this movie not only everyone who participated cared but also everyone around.The plot was all over the place, the point of the movie wasn't made clear. The motives of the characters weren't clear. The main character wanted to kill himself, the reasons to this weren't really explored. The audience was left guessing. The deaf girl wanted to kill herself too. Okay... why? They said something about hating herself, but why? The actions and motives of other characters also weren't clear.The relationships - unclear. Shoko tried to tell Shoyo that she liked him, but he didn't understand her and that the last we heard of the issue.Shoyo went to meet a girl he knew in middle school, she avoided him, then went to seek him but he didn't care to talk to her. So why did he try to contact her?There were a few minutes about Shoko's hearing aid - she was distressed after a visit to the doctor and later stopped wearing it in one ear. That was never explained. A shame since it was one of a very few moments that looked interesting in this movie.It was also very difficult to understand were the plot was trying to go. Was it trying to focus on the relationship between the two main character? If so, it was done poorly. Was it trying to focus on the inner journey Shoyo went through? If so, that was also done poorly, since his inner world was never shown or explained properly.The characters were unrelatable at all. Most of the side characters were a caricature of their bad traits. The two main characters were pretty boring.At the end apparently Shoko felt bad about something. Was it about leaving the class back in middle school? It's so ridiculous that I think (hope) I understood it wrong. But if not, it means that they left one of the main issues in the movie unclear. I'm yet again left guessing.Really could have gone without this one.",A Silent Voice - The Movie

This movie is truly a modern masterpiece; a work of art. From the complexity of the gripping story-line, to the astonishing aesthetic, beautiful art style and overall vibe given off by the movie, to the insane twists and turns, it has it all. The use of music in this movie simply adds to the beauty, the range from uplifting songs to songs that add to the dramatic and emotion bringing scenes add so much to the film as a whole. The foreshadowing of the movie is simply astonishing once you watch it multiple times over. The depth of the character's and the means they take upon themselves to find not only each other, but themselves on a deeper level really makes you see a different view on not only your own life, but what others may be experiencing as well. There seemed to be no unnecessary scenes in the movie and every minute of the film was fully engaging. Throughout this movie, I laughed, I cried, I rethought my entire view on various social experiences in my life and I thought of many of the ""what ifs"" that could take place both in the film and my own life. I truly believe this film is a masterpiece and a near perfect movie as a whole, it teaches and demonstrates many life lessons such as the meaning of happiness, resolve, finding your inner self through another, and much more and draws out emotions that not many things can do. For anybody who wants a film that is truly unforgettable, this is the movie for you.",A Silent Voice - The Movie

85,disup,Such a pretty movie,8,29 May 2017,"Koe no Katachi has so many virtues in comparison to western animation. Between consumerist nonsense from Ilumination, the bipolar quality of Dreamworks, the blatant prostitution of Disney and the insignificance of Blue Sky. Japan seems to put very high standards in their animated film industry.The film touches the themes of bullying, hypocrisy, double standards, suicide and social structure on individual, in a different approach with less ""black & white"" stereotypes without losing the melodramatic tone.It tells the story of Shoya a boy who molest Shoko a girl with deafness. His antics came to an extreme that she lefts school and the other children molest him now, even though most of them laugh at her or speak badly about her. Due to the abuse Shoya wants to commit suicide and fails. Time later he encounters Shoko again and now wants to become friends with her, although a lot of people prevent that due to his background as a bully.One good aspect of the film is how the manage the tone. Is is hard to have a cry scene and then have a joke successfully without an awkward feeling. However they do it decently with their comic relief characters, with give the some of the best bits. That and the drama is well handed, I have to admit that some scenes are kind of sad for example when Shoko apologizes to Shoka's mother.The animation is great, is fluent and pretty. With a very interesting color palette, pinks, the yellows, the greens and the blues just pop out of the screen, giving a somewhat melancholic but warm atmosphere.For negative I got to say that the pacing is weird, the first part of the movie that introduces to our main character and the background for the conflict goes a bit too quickly. However by the ending it goes for bit to long in one or two scenes i felt it was going to end but no. This does not affect the movie at all, but i can see people finding a bit difficult to get by. And the little development for some of the supporting characters, one or two are just there and their roles could be filled by others.

The animation it self was absolutely as expected and it got me in tears between family, friendship and relationships. Its message of bullying, karma and isolation really had a reflection in life which made me really love this film.
One thing I remember when I stepped out of the cinema with teary eyes was that there were small adaptations to the film which left some character development for other characters and which had some funny panels from the manga I was expecting in the film which never showed because it would of never made sense.
Although the approach to shorten the story from the manga really fit and didn't have any plot holes knowing that they cut out a few things and conflict between characters (but these were still shown).After reading and watching this.

We should also respect people even if they are disabled. In the movie, Shoya bullied Shouko and he realised his mistake when others started bullying him too. Both Shoya and Shouko were kind of alike both of them hated themselves for who they are, and tried to kill themselves.I really cried when Shouko tried to do suicide and Shoya saved him and fell off the building himself.Shouko and Shoya are really amazing and memorable characters potraying literally everyone's problems that is lonliness and depression.Must watch movie!!!",A Silent Voice - The Movie

One day, a new student joins Shoyo's class, Shouko, a girl who happens to be deaf. Shoyo, being the nasty kid he is constantly bullies her to a point where she leaves and to a point even his friends abandon him knowing that he has gone too far. The story of the movie is set during the present where Shoya is a shell of what he used to be. He has no friends and no will to go on. He decides that this life he is living can only be fixed by making ammends with Shouko and this movie tells the story of his redemption and the relationship these two characters create.Now, before watching this, I never considered myself an anime sort of guy. I had nothing against it but there were never any places to watch it where I am from. I found this movie on some illegal movie streaming service and I saw Chris Stuckmann review this movie earlier that week so I watched it just to see if it was as good as he says. And holy hell, the moment I finished this movie, I think a switch went off in my head.This movie helped me in so many ways in terms of my personality. For one, after watching this movie, I really became interested in Anime and I have watched many great movies and tv shows because of it. It also helped develop my love for film greater than any movie I can remember had. On an even deeper level, the development of Shoya's character helped me realise many things about letting people in and not being afraid to admit, I'm sorryBut why? Why this movie? There are so many movies out there with simmilar undertones so why did this movie help me. It is because A Silent Voice is so much more than a film about a guy and a deaf girl, it is a masterpiece of character relationship creating. The only way I can describe it is when you watch this movie, you, sitting on your couch become Shoyo, you become so invested in the story, you become personified into this character and you grow just like him.The animation of a Silent Voice is probably the best animation I have ever seen and this is coming from a huge animation fan. The way this movie manages light is no short of a triumph. Every frame feels like a painting yet the way the light bounces around each shot is magical. One thing I love about the animation is how they use the background around them. Every thing feels as if it is 3D in a way in relation to the characters, not to us of course but you can see the depth of how the environment reacts to the characters.I watched the dub, I know sue me but can I just say, the voice actors for this movie were bloody terrific. Especially the two main characters of Shoyo & Shouko. They each brought so much to the table and you believed every word they said.Don't be fooled though, this movie in my opinion isn't a love story, it may look like that on the poster but I don't see this movie as a love story. This is a story of redemption and friendship. This is the story of a kid who feels like he has nothing to live for climbing and trying his god damn hardest trying to forgive himself for what he did and in the end, the result will make you cryWhy is this movie my favourtie movie while films in my top 10 include the likes of masterpieces and classics such as Pulp Fiction, American Psycho & Midsommar. This movie, the reason this film beats them is
1) I cried for the first time watching a movie &-
2) This was one of the most real feeling movies I had ever watched
What I mean by this is that you completley buy in to every single characters dynamic and what they are striving for. They all feel like real characters. Even my number 2 movie made me think for a minute what each of my characters true role in the film was. A Silent Voice however, captures so much humanityA Silent Voice receives a 10/10",A Silent Voice - The Movie

I know I have a few ""demons"" like this but I'm not sure I posses the inner strength to make a mead.After 10-15 minutes into the movie, I realized I'm going to embark on an emotional journey I won't forget.
And the movie did delivered. This movie is one of a few (3-5) movies that make me envy those people from Man In Black, after watching it, the first thing I wanted to do is to use that device that erases your memory and watch it again.I find it truly amazing, that while other stories crafting worlds, religions, dimensions and even languages in order to enhance the emotional experience and provide new sensations. This movie describe something very real, something that for sure happened more than once (to a certain degree) in the real world.
Having said that, those ""normal"" experiences still stirring the viewer though his emotions into a fantastic experience.I have to add before I conclude, I have to add: This movie introduced some special, yet ordinary, people. Those people does not poses any super powers. HOWEVER, I can honestly say those people are far more stronger that the known superheros.So to conclude, It is highly recommended, a true gem in this ocean of movies.",A Silent Voice - The Movie
102,SaptarshiForYou,The Shape of Voice is a Gift of God,9,23 September 2017,"I came upon many films in this time, like Your name, Wolf Children, 5 Centimeters per Second, Garden of Words. And really they are all beautiful in their own ways. But today I came upon this film ""Koe No Katachi""(Aka A Silent Voice) and after watching this, I felt for an eternity that this is best film, I have ever seen in my life. Really this catalyst creation is a masterpiece in its terms and condition. It chooses a 60's song as OP which clearly brought out the jerk characteristics of the hero when he was a child and a solitary ending with soothing sound of reality which prevails the polished soul of the hero when he was successful in his way to redemption. The most important is that the story is not only focus in a point, but it is rather made a great impact through out our society and gave many celestial message about the bad effects of bulling, social anxiety e.t.c.At last I have to say it is a much worthy film that mankind should give it a run in their lifetime. This is a motivation being itself.Though I listened this news that it is not as attractive as the manga but i have to say, this film is enough to beat all categories. You have to agree that it is quite impossible to pen a 7 volume manga into a 2 hours film. So don't provide negativity, just fell it and be positive, It is only for your benefit. All the above is just my personal opinion, so don't carried away by it. And thanks for paying visit to this receive, I bet it touches you.",A Silent Voice - The Movie
103,martinwasdeleted,Koe no Katachi: A Silent Voice,10,22 April 2021,"I don't even know how many times I tried to write a complex review about this movie. Every time when I sit down to do it, I can't put my thoughts into words. Hopefully I will be successful this time.Koe no Katachi is a movie about a lot of subject. Here is the story in a nutshell: In the elementary school, Ishida lives his life as he wants to. He is the class clown basically, who does everything to conserve his own world. One day, a new student shows up: a deaf girl, called Nishimiya. She messes up the class life, because she obviously need support from her classmates, which becomes a burden after a short period of time. Ishida, who sees the girl as someone, who upsets the boy's life, start to bully her. Nishimiya's life becomes so horrible, that she has to change school. Clearly, Ishida is the main reason for this, so he gets back what he did to her; his friends start to bully him and everyone is avoiding him. We jump in the time: now Ishida is a high-schooler. He doesn't have any friends and he still carries the weight of what he did to his classmate. He even considers suicide, but life gives him another chance, to be forgiven and finally accept himself.As we can see, the story is well-written and complex enough. Now talk about the characters: Ishida is obviously a dislikeable character at the beginning, but as he grows up, he realises what he did and tries everything to make amends. Nishimiya, the victim of the bullying, is the type of girl who is so lovely that makes your heart melt every time you see her. Of course, these are just character templates, but as the movie goes further, we gain insight of their daily lives, feelings and most importantly, their pain. The pain, which was left over from the past. Koe no Katachi's success would be nothing, if the remarkable story didn't have such great characters, like Ishida and Nishimiya. The side characters, naturally, are not as well-written as the main ones, but we still gain a little insight of their ambitions and their feelings too; this is mostly true for the relatives and classmates of the two main characters.The art style is unique and beautiful, as we expected from Kyoto Animation. However, I really want to pull out the sounds and music. The sounds are so detailed, that we can't even realise it at the first time; as for the music, I can only say that every time I listen to 'lit(var)', I start to cry against my will. I'm just thinking about it right now, and it's enough to make me emotional. You can imagine how good the music is, if it can make me cry by just listening to it.And last but not least: what is this movie about? When I first thought about it, I wrote something like ""Connections with other people, and depression"". Well, this is still true partly, but from now, I think the main subject is 'forgiving and accepting'. ""Forgiving is easier than forgetting"" - I hear this everywhere. But lets be real: you may forgive something to someone, but you will still carry that scar with you. It doesn't matter how big it is, you have to carry it in your entire life. If the scar is that huge, it can change your personality or ruin your whole life. This is the reason why 'accepting' is even more important than 'forgetting' or 'forgiving'. And this is what the movie taught me. It taught me throughthout tears and pain, but in the most beautiful way I can possibly imagine.",A Silent Voice - The Movie
104,akaam-96900,Amazing Movie,8,4 October 2020,"Amazing and depressing film !! It has a unique script and it's so heart touching but I felt it went for too long it could've ended faster
Although it has a Strong Visual story and A solid soundtrackMy best friend has a bad taste in movies, and she decided to play this movie for me and I didn't expect to cry the way I did",A Silent Voice - The Movie
105,rsaavedra,Heartwrenching and heartbreaking,9,18 May 2018,"Started with manga book #1 but after the first few pages got the impression it was going to be too much of just another young adult school love drama. So decided to go ahead with the movie: if I liked it, then I would read the series.
Boy, I had no idea what I was getting myself into.
To start with the only negative comment I have: this is by far and beyond the movie which includes the most apologies I have ever seen in any movie. Some times it's not really clear whether the characters have any reason to apologize, they just feel terrible about something that happened, they can't or couldn't have changed it, they clearly wish it had not happened, or some times they even are the victims... In any case, they apologize, and apologize, and apologize... Almost all of them apologize at some point or another throughout the movie. And these are not casual apologies, some are very formal and intense, Japanese style, long and expressive ones.
And done with the negatives. I'm giving this movie 9/10 because even though the apologizing can feel suffocating at times, it's there because of rather serious circumstances which do pile up and call upon so many sorrys. Quite a nasty class of bullying is on the table. Also plain old meanness, unfairness, miscommunication, depression, isolation, low self esteem, fear, anxiety, love, loss, etc. etc. I found this light-looking young adult movie deeply heart wrenching and poignant. I'm not exactly a cry-baby, and second half of this movie I was pretty much in tears most of the time. From childhood till adulthood I grew up with a neighbor who was deaf-mute, that might be part of it. Also not sure if they used an actual deaf-mute actress for the German version but to me it sounded completely realistic and plausible the way a deaf-mute sounds like. Every time that character apologizes for anything, just to hear the way she pronounces ""Tut mir leid"" (sorry) is quite the heartbreaking experience for me, even if German is not my native language whatsoever.
This movie was also imho quite original, visually speaking. Simply beautiful.
After going through the unexpected emotional rollercoaster of watching it for the first time, only then I read about it and found out that both the movie and manga series have received several awards.
In conclusion, and needless to say, very very highly recommended.",A Silent Voice - The Movie
106,nillbass,It is dense and intense.,10,26 March 2021,"After watching this masterpiece I felt think8ng about it for hour afterwards. The scenes develops in a different pace, sometimes too fast sometimes too slow however both of situations, it is beautiful. The animation is marvelous, fantastic. The characters are deep, kaybe too deep for younger or teenagers, that probably will not understand why they act like that. Because it is about depression, and friendship. So if you are expecting to see some romance, (loke I was, I admit it) do not expect it, so my review must be a spoiler here, because I was surprised how it ends up just they realizing what they really needed all the time.",A Silent Voice - The Movie
107,qingruivic-25161,"Emotions, redemption and relationships",9,11 July 2018,"Interpersonal relationship is a really popular subject to discuss for Japanese anime, by which the point that Japanese culture does value social connections is shown.Apparently this anime is not just a romance in a traditional sense, it also reveals bullying as a serious issue existing in Japanese schools. A pitiful and lonely girl because she is deaf-mute, bullied by a boy in elementary school. Dramatic changes also happen to the boy, turning him into the bullied because of his wrong behavior, which makes him begin to understand the girl's misery and drown in guilt for his own mistakes. Then he makes his effort for redemption.However, for me this movie does not give a thorough enough discussion on the bullying topic as a youth problem. It instead focuses more on the emotions. Even a subtle emotional change can affect hugely on the relationships among the friends and they have to work hard to fix it. Youth is a delicate stage, where everything is in the process of growing up, especially learning to deal with relationships and emotions. Therefore, this movie offers a worth-watching lesson of Japanese perspective in this aspect.",A Silent Voice - The Movie
108,ava_ever,Sad & Sweet (yet) Horribly Incomplete,6,15 December 2019,"Beautiful animation with a heart-felt, tear-jerker of a storyline, yet I feel incomplete by the end of it.After the first 40min the film becomes extremely repetitive, with the main characters fighting, apologizing, fighting, and then apologizing again.Half way through the movie, Shoya Ishida is still unbelievably suicidal and guilty because of the bully he was in the past. (Past being literally the 6th grade when most children are just plain impulsive and dumb anways.) Even though he has since made things right with the girl he bullied.Oh, and not just ""made things right"" by apologizing, I mean by literally learning sign language for her, spending every single day with her practically, etc... Yet he is still tortured over and over again with hateful words / actions from people years ago.It definitely makes you feel. Oh how the tables turn, right? Well, at least Shoya and Shouko are friends now right? They're at least happy together, right?Eh, wrong.
They never get a chance to communicate their feelings for eachother even though it's pretty obvious that there's something there. They're basically the *only* people they have. Two troubled people. It seems romantic, until it's not.Shouko tries to communicate to Shoya that she likes him once - but she's too difficult for Shoya to understand what she's saying, she runs home crying and that's that.Soooo, from that point forward it's just a montage of Shouko and Shoya's fake friends from elementary school either hanging out and having fun on a rare occasion or continuing to bully Shoya for when he bullied Shouko .. OR bullying Shouko for being deaf?Speaking of Shouko's bullies.... how was Naoka ever forgiven by the end of the movie?! She's the real bully here if you ask me...I mean - all these years later and she's still treating Shouko like she did in elementary school, meanwhile Shoya (who actually GREW UP compared to Naoka) is wanting to DIE every single day because he's so riddled with guilt still!The movie 100% should have ended in the most climactic scene where Shoya and Shouku dream about eachother and run to the bridge in the middle of the night. They should have kissed and BOOM, what we've all been waiting for. Yet it drags on with the same crap friends showing up and there's never any romance between Shoya and Shouku. -_-This movie is sad, like, really sad.

112,austinlsweeney,"I was so into it, I was yelling at the screen for most of it...",8,9 March 2018,A Silent Voice Is more than just a really good high school romantic drama. It is a captivating love story that deals with depression and friendship in a remarkably relatable way. Without spoiling too much. I just really appreciate the believably of most of the film. Unlike Your Name where I found some parts to be overly cheesy or slow paced. A Silent Voice offers up nice character development and introduces a whole array of interesting side characters to the plot. I do really like the idea of having a deaf friend. I've often thought about what that would be like and the whole learning sign language and writing on a book to communicate. It offers a-not often seen- perspective of that life. I found it quite invigorating and motivating to step up my own life.,A Silent Voice - The Movie
113,MatthewOfDuncan,I wanted to cry... but I didn't.,9,13 February 2019,"I absolutely loved how real this film got. However, I did not love how cheesy this film got at times due to the problems I had with some the writing. There were many times where the voice acting didn't help either, at least for the American version (probably should've watched the Japanese version before I made this review). Furthermore, I think this film could benefit from having a shorter run-time, not that being long is bad in itself, its just that sometimes it felt like I was watching the same scene over and over again. With all that being said this is a film that I would recommend to all movie lovers, and one I would say is a must see for anime fans. This films shares extremely important messages that are all very relevant in today's society, and there are moments in this film that I will remember for years to come. So don't get me wrong, this is a really solid film, it just needs some work with the writing, pacing, and its American voice actors. Fix all of that and you have a masterpiece on your hands. Also if I had to say one thing to the makers of this film, I would tell them that sometimes there is real beauty in simplicity, as well as in silence, both of which are things that I think this film needs more of.

115,lasreviews,"Beautifully animated, mesmerizing both visually and emotionally.",9,23 September 2019,"I've been a fan of animation all my life. It was only natural to move from after school cartoons to more sophisticated anime as I got older. Although, to be honest, not all anime is sophisticated. A lot of it - and a lot of the stuff I choose to watch - is flat out silly. This, however, is not the case for A Silent Voice.To the contrary, A Silent Voice is a much different, more serious sort of anime. Which brings me to some content warning: this movie deals with bullying as well as suicidal ideation. Although it is handled well, it can still be upsetting at times.Shoko Nishimiya is the new girl in school and while she looks as normal as everyone else, she has one major difference - she's deaf. Unfortunately, this sets her up for bullying by her classmates, leaving her feeling ostracized and alone. Despite this, Shoko never stops trying to make friends and to be a part of the group. Things escalate and Shoko is eventually transferred to another school in hopes of giving her a better experience. Sadly, this is all too common in our schools these days. Kids can be the cruelest of people at times. Brutal honesty at its harshest.Fast forward to high school. Shoya Ishida, formerly one of Shoko's biggest tormentors, finds himself on the other side of the fence. After helping another loner being harassed by a bully, Shoya decides to search out Shoko in an attempt to redeem his past self.He has a long road ahead of him because he was quite awful to Shoko in elementary school. However, years of being a social outcast have changed him. Shoya's no longer able to look others in the eye and has no one he can call a friend. Reuniting with Shoko changes everything for both himself and for Shoko and her family. Slowly, they begin to build a lasting friendship that they never had the chance to start in elementary school.Beautifully animated, A Silent Voice is mesmerizing both visually and emotionally. I often found myself laughing one moment at one of Tomohiro Nagatsuka's antics and sobbing the next. Every time a red x fell from someone's face, I felt my heart skip with joy for Shoya. Dark, and yet full of hope, this is a movie for families to watch together, or for friends to share with one another. It's all too true to reality which only makes it more of a must-see movie. I saw so much of my own high school days in these characters, making me connect even more to them all in one way or another. Parent or not, teen or not, I think most of us will be able to relate to the story of A Silent Voice.",A Silent Voice - The Movie
116,mariannacool,"""A silent voice"" is pleasantly...loud",10,4 September 2020,"Until I had the pleasure to watch ""A Silent Voice: the movie"" I was under the misapprehension that the anime-style and quality established by the great master Hayao Miyazaki, was long gone. It was with great relief that I realized how mistaken I was.""A Silent Voice"" is one of the rare movies that can be rightfully called ""human""; there is nothing forced in terms of the plot, nothing dramatic or supernatural with regard to presentation that could possibly mislead the viewer or mischievously attempt to cover any flaws. The movie itself is only a pure, transparent, crystal clear pond. That does not, nevertheless, mean that the waters aren't troubled.The movie focuses on the relationship between Shoko Nishimiya, a deaf girl, and Shoya Ishida, the boy that bullies her in 6th grade to the point of her having to transfer to another school. As a result of his actions, Shoya gets to have a taste of his own medicine, as he gradually becomes a pariah and he is scorned by the rest of his classmates. This abrupt change of reality transforms Shoya himself and gives him the opportunity to change for the better, while facing self-loathing, suicidal thoughts and numbness and discomfort when it comes to socializing.In contrast to many other commercial movies, the character who at the beginning is presented as the bully, does not remain bounded to this facet of his personality but instead, he is treated as a troubled human being with complicated feelings and a true capability of change. Shoko Nishimiya, respectively, is not facing difficulties only due to being in some way handicapped, but also because of her low self-esteem and naivete that make her susceptible to self-harm and vulnerability. Nonetheless, despite their conflicting emotions and inner turmoil, Shoko and Shoya manage to navigate their tumultuous reality together, with the aid of some very interesting secondary characters such as charmingly possessive Nagatsuka and emotionally impaired Ueno.I would recommend this movie to anyone who is willing to watch a film that offers a unique kind of rewarding escapism. There is no action, no extravagant setting, no ingenious plot-twist, no breath-taking scenery. But underneath this silent urban façade of flawed characters lies an experience that undeniably deserves to be heard.",A Silent Voice - The Movie
117,tomcrew-52093,Remarkable,10,26 January 2019,"So let me be completely transparent here. I went into this film without any idea what it was about, other than the synopsis that above. I didn't watch any trailers or head to Wikipedia. And to be honest, I'm so happy I didn't, because this film truly shocked me.
So without spoiling the film, let me explain a bit about it. It starts with a group of kids in sixth grade. They're quickly introduced to a new student named Nishiyama Shoko, who just so happens to be deaf. Since she can't communicate normally (and since the students don't use sign language), she asks that they communicate with her via a notepad she owns. Surely enough, the students take it upon themselves to give Nishiyama a tough time. The main one who partakes in the bullying of Nishiyama is our protagonist, Ishida Shoya. Day in and day out, Ishida picks on Nishiyama and his other classmates back him up and do it too. Of course one day Ishida goes too far with his bullying, and it leads to him having a tough time in his older years, and ultimately trying to change his ways and make amends for everything he did as a kid, while still having to deal with the day-to-day things that most teens deal with.This film was directed by Naoko Yamada and I have to say she did a spectacular job touching on not only bullying, but social anxiety, depression, and suicide in this film. These are all issues things that teenagers struggle with daily, and to have them presented so accurately in a Japanese animation was a sight to see.There are a lot of supporting characters that we meet when Ishida is a sixth grader that we meet again once when the film has a time skip that takes us to his high school years. Each of these characters has their own internal struggle that has followed them from childhood to adolescence. However, the main focus is on Ishida and Nishiyama's relationship. When the two of them meet as kids, it's something of a one-sided battle, with Ishida constantly bullying Nishiyama, and Nishiyama just brushing it off and still playing nice. However after all of the ordeals that he puts her through, when they finally run into each other years later, Nishiyama is is still nice to him and eventually, they become very, very close.It's truly difficult to give this film a fair review because there's so much to be discussed but I prefer to allow the readers to enjoy it with as little spoilers as possible. It was a bit longer than most anime films - standing at a strong 2h 10m- but in that time, I was able to connect with a group of people in an age group close to my own, dealing with personal demons that they refuse to admit exist for a solid majority of the film. Like I said in the title, this is a coming-of-age story, and each of our characters matures at different times through a different situation. I found myself tearing up during some scenes because this film wasn't afraid to get emotional. There's a specific scene that involved Nishiyama and Ishida that completely took me by surprise to me and I was truly at the edge of my seat all the way through it.At the same time though, It could be said that some of the scenes where characters spoke to each other were a bit cheesy, and over the top at times. Another thing that I struggled with was keeping up with the first act of the film at times. It seemed like the scenes were kind of scattered all over the place initially, but after a while, you get used to it and realize that the film is just giving you a quick look at these people as children.In the end, A Silent Voice is a remarkable film, and I highly recommend that any of you who watch it share it with all of your friends, because this is one that you don't want to miss. It's the type of film that has you put yourself in the characters' shoes and look at things from their perspective. The subject matter was very important to today's world because bullying happens more and more nowadays, and a film like this can show you just how much bullying can mess with someone's psyche for years and years to come. Although the ending wasn't exactly how I was hoping the film concluded, it still left me with a feeling of satisfaction, and I was happy to see things pan out that way. I'm definitely going to watch this one again, and I'll be copping the Blu-ray.",A Silent Voice - The Movie

The story, the characters. Everything about this show was absolutely beautiful. Truly breathtaking, and in my honest opinion, it is better than the other hit ""Your Name."" Which is another beautiful anime. This movie. This movie however, doesn't focus on romance. This movie focuses on the harsh reality of life. Bullying, suicide, self harm. This movie shows a lot about life. The story follows a boy called Shouya Ishida, and his attempts to own up and ask for forgiveness from his bullied victim of Shouko Nishimiya. He had bullied her, because of her disability of being deaf. Although, at the start of the movie, you may say that everyone was very harsh. They was. 100% agree. However, these kids were very young, they misunderstood Shouko. Another reason why, one of the major meanings of the anime was the Shape of Voice, the beauty in it. What it means to communicate. The beauty of making friends and having a good life. These kids, were very rude and insensitive. Shouya was the main bully, however everyone had blamed him, instead of telling him to stop. Although, yes it maybe true that he was in the wrong. But telling someone they are wrong, after they lose everything, is a harsh reality. Shouya had lost everything in his mind. This movie shows his rehabilitation. Him trying to fix things. Not everything goes right. But this movie just speaks a thousand volumes. Beautiful. Amazing movie, I could watch it a thousand times and still be touched by it's meanings. Shouko, is so innocent too, that she felt she was at fault for her being bullied.

I for one I'm only 18 and I still don't know myself. This movie what the main character sees when he looks at other people i believe it to be a similar kind of thing, we all have people we look at and would even think to talk to.

132,jakepanek,One of the best animated films I've ever seen,10,22 June 2019,"A Silent Voice is terrific, heartbreaking, heartwarming, humorous, vibrant; hell, I could make a review just out of adjectives describing this movie. It's a film that has many small nitpicks, but Naoko Yamada set out to tell a story. And tell it she did. What really stood out to me on this viewing is how the usage of the visuals in a way replicated the story and signifies moments of importance. The appearance of the foggy, growing light in Shoya's mind, or the red fish that Shoko always feeds on Tuesdays, or the fireworks, linking Shoya and Shoko's attempts at suicide.The roller coaster sequence this time around really stood out. It works for so many reasons. It exhibits every character, their personalities, their reactions to the ride. Sahara is carefree, but reveals that she wasn't always that way. Shoya is scared but trying to hide it. Sueno is trying to look cool, simply staring off into the distance and looking bored. Yuzuru is protective of her sister and is concerned only about her, and Shoko is terrified, stiff as a board. But the fireworks scene still is my favorite. Sorry.MASTERPIECE",A Silent Voice - The Movie

139,ryan-wackyraces,Your past actions don't define your entire life,10,20 May 2018,"I watched this movie only yesterday, and I was really entertained by the whole movie. But it wasn't until today that I realized just how much I loved it. Various scenes went around in my head and the messages of the movie were made clear in my mind.Is this the greatest movie ever made? No. Is it one of my personal favorite movies of all time? Without a doubt, the answer is yes.From a story point of view, Koe no Katachi is a very unique movie. To my knowledge, there has never been an animated movie based around a Deaf character in any shape or form, and if there were, the deafness is usually used as a comedic tool. This movie takes the concept of a deaf girl and uses it as an aid for emotion. This is a redemption story, about a man who tries to redeem himself not for anyone else in particular, but instead for himself and the girl, as he realizes that what he did all those years ago was wrong and he needs to put them rightAs this is an Anime movie, Art is very important to get right. This movie has an believably beautiful, yet simplistic art style. For me, it fits somewhere between the shade and detail heavy (yet somewhow still simplistic) Kimi No Na Wa and the simple shade light style of Toki wo Kakeru Shoujo. It's very pleasing to the eyes and heavily relies on a lot of light shades of colour, which contrasts very nicely with any shading it might useSoundwise, the movie uses a lot of pleasing piano melodies that accentuate the raw emotional parts of certain scenes and really draws you in. The use of the Who's 'My Generation' at the start isn't something that I expected in this kind of film (usually it's a J-Rock or J-Pop song), but it fits with the part it's used in. The neding some also has beautiful lyrics that sum up the messages in the movieThe characters in this film all have defining traits that make them stand out. The main character's redemption completely changes his character, to the point where he changes for the better, while still containing elements of his personality of his younger self. The deaf girl is a beautiful character who only wants people to understand what she's been through and to always show a smile and always look on the bright side. She is without a doubt my favorite character in the movie, as her determination to put things right even if they aren't her fault really spoke to me and I really wanted her to be happy. Plus I thought she was just really adorable and by the end I just really wanted to reach out and give her a big hug and let her know everything is OK. i won't talk about the other characters as it would spoil key points, but they are all vital to the development of the 2 main characters and all have defining traits.This was one of the most enjoyable movies that I had ever seen. The amount of thought that went into writing every word was evident. Every second of this movie was top quality and I couldn't pick a single flaw at any point in the film. There were just so many messages in the film, but I think that main one was basically; No matter what you've done in your past, if you've ever bullied anyone or picked on anyone, if you've done harm to others, it is never too late to redeem yourselves. Even if it's just for yourself so you aren't haunted by your past, or if you want to put things right with someone who deserves all the best or didn't deserve hate in the past. The important thing to remember is if you really try, you can create good deeds from bad memories. Getting into Anime really has been on of the best things I've ever done. The quality of the stories, the emotional values and the effect it has you is like nothing I've ever witnessed before.",A Silent Voice - The Movie

141,urosjekna,This movie changed my life,10,14 January 2019,"It taught me about how people that bullied me only did that because I never spoke up and that infuriated them even more. They thought that I thought that I was the only victim in those situations. I wasn't the only one that was bullied in my class. There was a guy that had hearing problems which most of the kids in my class treated the same way the characters did Nishimiya at the beginning of the movie (they were kind to him and helped him out whenever they could) but a few days pass and that routine becomes annoying to everyone because he ""doesn't contribute"" to anything and he gets all the special treatment so everyone started to turn on him besides me and a couple of other people. What I would like to say next is that I was like grown up Mashiba in the movie and made them stop doing that, but no, I was like the most despicable character in the movie, Kawai. I thought of myself as someone that was good just because I thought what they were doing was bad. I also thought it was brave of me to say they should quit doing that, but as soon as I sensed they might turn on me even more, I just stopped saying that to them. Now that I've watched this movie I am disgusted by my younger self and that I ever thought I was a good person for just thinking what the others were doing to him was bad instead of taking action. I now know, because of this movie, why almost nobody liked me when I was younger. I am a changed man now, bsacuse of this movie.

And i tried to help when i could, but i could only do so much, when they are brought up to apologise for being the way they were. Or i should say they were brought up to believe they were at fault.And the girl in the movie was the same, trying to be friends with the boy. Who at first bullied her, then when he grew up and wanted to apologise, she still felt the need to blame herself for being different. Kids are cruel to those who have differences, but my review doesn't give the film the justice it needs i highly recommend you watch it.",A Silent Voice - The Movie

The voice actors do a great job and at over two hours it's great value for money. It might also be worth mentioning at the screening I went to the cinema was about half full, which is a good turn out for a sub-titled animated feature.Unfortunately it's not a film that I particularly want to watch again and there a number of reasons for that. While I'm aware that it's based on a manga, it feels too long and I'm sorry to say depressing. Most of the characters are people that you wouldn't want to spend much time with and there is maybe only one scene that could be called funny. Also just because it's long doesn't mean that all the conflicts are going to be resolved.Don't get me wrong if you're an anime fan you're probably going to like this, but I can't see it appealing to a wider audience.",A Silent Voice - The Movie

152,dwij-44289,Beautiful visuals but not much else....,3,16 December 2017,"I am surprised to see how highly critics and audiences have rated this film. I find this movie visually spectacular with nice music and it started on an interesting note. The storytellers of this film are sincere with themes like depression, heartbreak and isolation.
However, there is a list of things I would like to point to in which this film has fallen short: Firstly, the characters are not very relatable and in fact, even irritating. The boy as well as the deaf girl are unrelatable and difficult to root for. The deaf girl (Nishiyama), especially is hard to empathize with it because she is so emotionally weak and self-abhorring. The film treats her with so much admiration and respect when, honestly, I think there were other characters who I thought deserved more admiration and attention than her. 2) Also, I think that other characters like the dark-haired bully girl was more interesting because we could really have delved into the reasons of why she bullied Nishiyama, her insecurities. Howeve, the film mocks this character. Nishiyama, the deaf girl, on the other hand, is never criticized in that way for her self-pitying and her weakness but she is elevated. Perhaps, because they consider her sins to be a 'virtuous' kind whereas toher characters' sins are much heavier. This sort of discrimination seems unfair. Thirdly, the film felt overlong. I am okay with stories meandering a lot and exploring themes we do not expect, but this film stretches so much and SO MANY (god, so many) over-sentimental, melodramatic events occur (suicides, fights, crying) that by the time we have reached the end with the Ishida finally finding redemption, we don't care anymore. We are more relieved that the film is over than that he has become more open towards people in his school. I guess this is the fault with a lot of anime movies (like 'Your Name') that they are mushy and try to be too 'kawaii' (deaf, sweet girl meets her bully and changes his life, but she is stainless. She changes everyone's life, the girl is so cute with her signature smiles and pink hair). It is hard to take it seriously. I don't think stories of depressed teengaers with issues should be reduced to overly sentimental, cutes-y and cringey moments. Teenagers deserve a somber, more complex insight without promises of easy conclusions and redemption. 
Maybe I am being too hard on a movie that is obviously directed towards teens and pre-teens who love anime and enjoy kawaii moments with good-looking heroes and plainer side-kicks. If you love a good tear-jerker and love rom-com tropes this one is def for you. If you want a film that is more accurate about depression and isolation, and is dark and dry, instead of cliched, preachy and sentimental, STAY. AWAY.",A Silent Voice - The Movie
153,Pastel_loca,A great film,8,6 July 2019,"While I was on a trip back home from a week long vacation trip I watched a silent voice (aka, the shape of voice as the movie states within the beginning and end of it) and it's really good. I remember reading the manga of it a couple of years ago during middle school and I remember enjoying it for its story and tone and this film was a great adaptation of said manga, even if I don't remember everything from it. The animation is better than the average anime by a long shot (I guess that's to be expected from films like this). The story and characters are solid for the most part. The parts that were cut off from the original manga were parts I remember not being all that important to the story except extra character development. The English acting is great, it felt like every actor gave it their all for each scene, there wasn't any part of the film that I remember that was underacted or overacted. However there's a couple of problems I found with it and these are heading to potential spoiler talk so if you haven't seen the movie yet please stop reading or at least read at your own risk anyways.
The music for the funeral scene is made in a way it sounded broken, I literally thought my headphones were breaking but halfway through I realized that it's how it literally sounds like, but I'm no musical genius here but it's just a weird composition choice for the scene (to me). Now this next problem is more of a personal preference but it's that Shouko's (the deaf girl's) voice sounds a little weird, then again I know nothing about deaf people and how they'd usually sound like so I guess it ain't a big deal but it's still a problem I kinda had with it.",A Silent Voice - The Movie

159,qrbjyc,A uniquely melancholic cinematic experience,10,14 November 2021,"Each and every shortcoming this movie has is made up tenfold by the sheer quantity and volume of emotional depth it is capable of presenting. Not a second of time is wasted in this movie. The opening immediately hits you in the feelings and the movie never lets up for a second. Every moment, piece of dialogue, and character serves a purpose that the movie would not be the same without. The reincorporation and payoffs this movie provides are subtle, while still being meaningful and powerful in their effect. Each character is unique, memorable, and perfectly realized. Even the smallest and most trivial exchanges between characters are loaded with emotion and purpose. The pacing is remarkably efficient for a two hour movie and there is never a dull moment. The animation is beautiful and eye catching, with the environments and expressions being particularly note worthy. The editing and cinematography is sublime and artistic, always adding to a scene drastically. The medium of animation is fully justified through the series artistic choices that would simply be impossible in a live action format. The music is incredible and dynamic, and may be the best part of the movie. All of this together makes for one of the most genuine and heartfelt experiences in cinema.",A Silent Voice - The Movie

164,PedroBarros_23,"My bar was set too high with ""Omohide poro poro"" - Only Yesterday",4,6 October 2017,"I'll start by admitting that I'm not very familiarized with the anime movie genre in general, even less so with titles that are mainly dramas. That said I did have a previous experience with an amazing dramatic/romantic anime movie, ""Omohide poro poro"" - Only Yesterday, which until this date is one of the most remarkable movies I ever saw. With that in mind I was curious about this movie, because I kept hearing good things about it, and how it handled such delicate themes like bullying and depression. Now, regarding the movie itself, personally, I found it to be a big lackluster in many aspects, and the overall, over-the-top, melodramatic tone almost made the movie unbearable at some points. I'll briefly summarize what main issues I had: 𝐜𝐡𝐚𝐫𝐚𝐜𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐬: I felt like there were too many characters, and most of them were underdeveloped. Most of the time I was struggling to understand the motivation behind their behaviors and reactions because their personalities/traits/goals were not well established. 𝐭𝐨𝐧𝐞: I know that the main demographic for this movie are teenagers, but still, I couldn't help to feel that the way they handled delicate issues like depression/anxiety/bullying is so overtly melodramatic that it almost rips the seriousness out them. When I saw ""Only Yesterday"", I felt the tone managed to be nostalgic, serious and whimsical, showcasing great balance and attention to detail to portray emotion. Now, with ""Koe no Katachi"" I felt like I was constantly being force- fed ""emotional"" scenes and dialogue, just for the sake of ""feels"". 𝐦𝐮𝐬𝐢𝐜: Some of my favorite movie scores of all time are from anime movies (e.g. My Neighbour Totoro; Howl's Moving Castle, and many other). That being said, I found this soundtrack to be pretty forgettable, and at some points it even added to the overall over- the-top melodramatics. 𝐚𝐧𝐢𝐦𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: The animation was, to me, the only redeeming aspect of this movie. There are a couple of great scenes that present really nice details that manage to illustrate the importance of non-verbal communication in human relationships.To wrap up, I want to disclose that perhaps I'm just not used to watch anime dramas, and perhaps all the tropes and details I found annoying are just part of the style itself. That being said, I would recommend people to watch ""Only Yesterday"", a film that maybe is responsible for my ""anime drama"" expectations bar being raised too high.",A Silent Voice - The Movie
165,tutitalvarez,A Master Piece About Depression and Self-love,9,16 September 2019,"I started this movie without any context and expecting a romantic story like many anime movies.This story really goes beyond and shows a beautiful picture of depression, anxiety and learning about self-love.
Even though a great part of the story is between the two main characters and their relationships together, the main focus is the protagonist, Shoya, and his dealing with the consequences of his actions and his own mind.
It's beautiful to see how well portrayed depression is. From the fact that he can't look people in the eyes, to how he can't believe he's allowed to have fun or friends at all.But maybe the best part is, in a heart-warming way, how he's able to break from his struggles and let himself be happy again. In the last scene, when he finally let's his own isolation go and allows himself to see and hear everyone, you can feel the wave of emotions it brings to him and how you have actually reached the happy ending.TL;DR An amazing movie with a great story, great characters, beautiful animation and soundtrack; full of emotions with a non-conventional way of portraying love towards others and yourself.",A Silent Voice - The Movie

It seems a little uncomfortable and pointless at first, but just stick with it. The film gave me goosebumps at scenes you wouldn't expect.

There wasn't quite as much character development as was present in the manga for obvious reasons, but the way it was handled by no means left a bad taste in my mouth. It is a wonderful work as a movie and as an adaption. I had to try my best to hold back the tears while watching at some of the more emotionally powerful parts. Left me satisfied in almost every way a movie can, and though it isn't perfection, it is one of the best recently released films that I have seen.",A Silent Voice - The Movie

171,jblow-00525,Lacking compared to Souce Material but still good,7,21 October 2020,"Lets be fare the source is too long for one movie, but shoya character is only a shadow of himself and misses his development early on which help define him. This could have easy fit in the movie but it would make him a more complex and real person. Shoko get alot of attenuation, but the rest of the group get almost none and some even have changes are detrimental to the character which make no sense.i followed the author from the first release and am aware of the issues with other parties wanting a different direction for the story (an example is this movie and the english translation changes) the japanese version is slightly better but not by much and the english voice actors dont always match with the characters.all i can say is ""Yoshitoki Oima you first pubished story is amazing, try not to let other push you around"" and if you like the movie the manga is better but a little darker but asks about moral questions on acceptable behaviors and their effects on peoples lives.",A Silent Voice - The Movie

The beginning was great with him turning off his cellphone and taking out all the money in his account and quitting his job and then giving it to his mom us all wonder why he gave her money with it saying I'm sorry and then him almost about to kill himself but stopping hearing a firework then it goes into a flashback of him in school when shoko came to the school it was great telling a story of him bullying her and her apologizing was sad and then we find out why he gave the money to his mom the rest of the story through his point of view with everyone with a purple X on there face showing he doesn't trust anyone and then the fireworks part i cried hard when he gets his redemption him saving her and saying he'll look everyone in the face from now on and then when he gets out and they have the moment of him apologizing to her but she feels like she needs to say sorry and then the ending with him seeing everyone's faces without the X is sad because it shows he held on to his promise and I'm still trying to wonder what was at the end of the light at the end

174,ncnarit,A SILENT VOICE(Amazing!),9,1 March 2021,"A Silent Voice is a dark, violent movie with a lot of realism. It is a cartoon reflecting Japanese society. Teenage life and friendship That comes with bullying, violence, and suicide, which many scenes are not suitable for children.Enough is not a love movie the general audience may be less involved. But not because the movie is not good. But just because I, in my childhood, had no direct experience with bullying cases, on the contrary, I actually felt that this was a good cartoon movie that expands society and gives us a better understanding of another group.The story begins with the characters in grade 6, deaf girl Shoko Nishimiya moved to a new one, although she tries to do good. But she does not get along well with friends the most serious thing is that she is severely bullied by the bully Shoya Ishida. Every day, five years have passed, and people have grown apart and grown up, but this time, Shoya becomes a stranger with no one else want to be acquainted with. He reunited with Shoko and tried to fix everything he had done in his childhood. Although the heroine has pity with her nature or disability that sets her apart from her peers. But her incompatibility was actually not a deformity. If this is your consistent goodness So good that it seems like you have only one flaw: weakness. Sometimes we do not know what to call it. Good luck or bad luck That she didn't have to hear the teasing from her classmates but what is definitely serious is that even if you do not hear but she was physically bullied, which left her no less hurt than abusive words she hadn't heard. Other normal characters, including the protagonist They are all monsters, either directly or indirectly. Express more or express less It can be seen that everyone tries to act mean in order to be accepted by the group. At that time, the male protagonist didn't understand why the heroine had to be good all the time. It's strange, why not try to fit in with other people, even though myself and my classmates haven't even tried to learn sign language to communicate with her.Up to this point, one of the things that the average viewer may have had the same emotions or experiences as the protagonist of the movie. Each character Both main and supporting characters They all seem to exist in our school, but they are small to grow, that is, we have to think of at least one of our school friends. We've all met people who mean, or not, we ourselves, who were more or less mean to other people, but mean sometimes doesn't always mean he's bad. At the very least, as he grew up, he slowly learned the true 'friend'. He slowly understood the remorse and tried to correct it. But society just froze the idea of itself being bully, it had to be bully forever, and convinced that it wasn't bully like that. I made this Forgetting to think that it will be more, less, will be lighter, karma is karma, doing is doing and delivering results all together.The movie tells the story continuously and is quite long (2 hours and 9 minutes). Sometimes I get bored. But it's also good that there are jokes or hilarious characters. And I like the storytelling with many scenes, for example the male protagonist is not sociable. Therefore, rarely eye contact So many pictures Which is the view of the hero Interesting is the hero who used to have friends has herd. But he turned out to be someone who can speak but rarely speak. How he loses friends and social acceptance? The answer is not everyone hates him that he really likes bully, but everyone starts hating him. When he speaks the truth about others and then that is the truth that the person does not want to hear or admit that he does... he himself is... especially anything that is bad.Silence in the meaning of A Silent Voice, or the sound that cannot be heard, thus has a profound meaning.

I think it focuses more on the life and morals aspect and not fantasy that's why it's not rated high enough.I would rate the animation the absolute best. Also the music beats in the movie sync and provide justice to every frame. Believe me it's magical.It's not really a ""romantic"" story.

183,sentnza,A deep analysis about how people are and how people can change,10,23 July 2018,"This movie is so mature. The movie deals with more mature topics as you can say at the end.1) how bullying can have a bad influence on a guy/girl, but also that for a children to act as a bully it's a reaction to what he cannot understands or what is so far from him, so different.
A 9yo child can be wicked without being it for real.2)how a child grows changing his mind, his point of view whereas other school mates don't.3) How it's so difficult to relate with other people or be accepted for a disabled guy4) How depression can push yourself to give your life away with a suicide.And so more... as you can see this movie drive you to think about all the film.The direction is wonderful. You can clearly understand what character are feeling.Why you are here to read, go to see the masterpiece!",A Silent Voice - The Movie
184,rti9-929-5803,This movie isn't a romance. It is a drama about depression.,8,1 June 2017,"Despite revolving around a girl who has impaired hearing, the film has as protagonist Shoya Ishida. He is a bully during his childhood, but when he becomes the victim of bullying himself he grows into a depressive teenager who loathes himself. He starts to understand Nishimiya's solitary world. Both Ishida and Nishimiya end up becoming teenagers who deeply despise themselves for all the burden they cause to their families and how painfully difficult it is to try to make friends.An interesting scene happens when a girl confesses her love to Ishida and he is unable to comprehend what is happening. Some people might say he is too dense to misunderstand what she is clearly doing, but what I see is Ishida hates himself so much he doesn't believe anyone can love him. The concept of a person actually liking him is so alien it doesn't even comes as a possibility in his head.Another interesting scene is when Ishida is leisurely walking and talking with some people and he asks himself if that is really OK. In his head, he has no right of being happy after everything he has done and caused. Despite trying his hardest to redeem himself, he still thinks he is worthless and unforgivable.Don't go into this movie expecting a romance. It is a redemption story.",A Silent Voice - The Movie

186,zhenzhen-00800,Extremely Shallow Compared To The Manga,4,30 December 2018,"I must say, amazing animations!HOWEVER,There is zero development on the side characters. ZERO.In the manga, each side character is explained and has their own backstory, and I think that adds much more meaning to the entire plot.Yuzuru is such a wonderful character yet only 10% of her concern and love for Shoko is shown in the movie. They never explain why she took photos of dead things. They never elaborated on her actions and words.Each one of Shouya's friends has their own backstory, however it's all thrown out the window and all we get are characters with random actions.The entire story would be better if made into a short series.

It was good to follow him through this path and to seee and sense all the obstacles he faces.The end was amazing, the movie taugth us that we dont need to face all the hardships alone.

191,solahuddeen,A healthy dose of drama that we never knew we needed.,8,20 May 2017,"A Silent Voice or Shape of Voice is a beautiful drama film about a guy who struggles to redeem his past that tackles heavy themes such as bullying.Apparently, there are a lot of characters in this 2-hour long film. And quite a number of them I believe didn't develop to the maximum as the film concludes but it was suffice enough to convey the message that the film desires to.However, huge compliments should be given to this film for the amazing build up before reaching its climax which is realistically intense, powerful and heartfelt that will leave you on the edge of your seat with your jaws dropped. You might as well cry, too.The only technical thing that I didn't like in this film is that some scenes have unusual tones that don't match well with their focuses (most probably because of cultural differences). It was really odd for me.In a nutshell, I love this film for tackling heavy themes and also for its healthy dose of drama. I believe it might be better if it's made into a series.

I even cried a couple of times thru it & that's rare 4 me 2 cry during movies. The only other movies I've ever recalled crying at were E.T., The Green Mile & Dances with Wolves.But this movie is next level, trust! It tackles issues that aren't common in the animation world, let alone anime world, including disabilities (in the case o' this film, primarily deafness & troubling eye contact), suicidal thoughts, social anxiety & bullying. All these subjects R done in a masterful way & given I myself have sum disabilities, it was really hard-hitting 2 me. This was a film that made me feel better about who I am & that I shouldn't let any negative aspects of myself get in the way of my own self-being. I myself create & write a lot of characters wit disabilities, so this movie pretty much gave me more motivation 2 work wit them.So, pretty much - gorgeous animation, great characters, a story wit a huge emotional impact & subject matters that IMO really need 2 B looked at more in animation & anime.If U haven't watched it, I suggest U go & do that right now, as it is truly something special.In other words, it's a 10/10 modern masterpiece",A Silent Voice - The Movie

Ishida was an incredibly relatable character to anyone who has said something stupid in the past and wanting to make up for it, as well as someone who isolates themsleves from others. Ishida was not the only amazing character in the film of course, and despite not being as fleshed out as the source material, I still enjoyed the cast quite a bit. The most impressive part of the movie was the raw emotion that surrounded ever scene. From remourse to absolute devastation, this movie captures it all. Despite usually having a poker face through emotional scenes, I felt tears swell up in my eyes when Nishimya broke down near the end of the movie. Don't let the anime artstyle keep you from watching this movie.",A Silent Voice - The Movie
199,blacknova-60216,"Yes, it's a masterpiece",10,19 July 2019,"Without adding exaggerated dramatic scenes, this movie has the elements for being a perfect drama.
Discrimination, love, life, depression, friendship, betrayal, death, loneliness and all of the human feelings are there in a group of teenagers, and mainly two of them, who struggle to understand each other beyond what makes them different, both mentally and physically.
The movie has a deep and touching message.
Despite the animation not being amazingly colourful or full of shadings, the music and the visual sequences allow for the spectator to connect with the characters. Because of this, I highly recommend paying attention to every detail and analogy.
Without spoiling much, I'd like to point out that its characters are incredibly realistic. It's not the typical movie with a Deux ex Machina or a life-changing event which makes all of the characters suddenly realise their mistakes or become more mature from one scene to the other, so that at the end everyone is happy. It is actually closer to what real life is.
This movie is definitely a must watch , not only for anime fans, but for everyone.",A Silent Voice - The Movie

Your Name overshadowed this film despite it being much much worse than the movie it overshadowed. I mean A Silent Voice is better than Princess Mononoke, Spirited and Your Name combined. Not only is this, my favourite film of 2017 (yes, it's better than Coco), or my favourite animated film of the decade, but my favourite film of all time with The Guardians of the Galaxy 1 and 2 in 2nd, the toy story franchise (including 4) in 3rd, Wall-e in 4th etc. This an underrated masterpiece that I couldn't recommend enough, except for thoses under 13.To those at Kyoto animation, alive or dead, thank you for making this beautiful experience that I stays true to the original manga that is also my favourite manga of all time.

205,aidilfaizal-31733,A review on A Silent Voice,9,10 September 2020,"The story of the silent voice, a story about a young man troubled by his past wrongdoings of bullying seeks to find forgiveness in those he has hurt. This story is simple, a guy who troubled another person looks to seek forgiveness from them because they found out what they did was wrong. However, A Silent Voice's execution to this story made it worth my time. First, we need to know that the movie is revolved around a young man, Shouya who bullied Shouko, a deaf girl to the point he became ostracized by his class. That becomes our main driving point on to why Shouya wants to look for redemption.The characters of this movie are all abstract and complex, and the director uses very clever cinematography to define which characters have that complexity. The soundtrack becomes one of the focusing points on this story, the piano themes of the characters, Shouko's piano theme became such an immersive piece as it was recorded with the sound of the piano hammers hitting the strings and you could hear all all the vibrations in the wood which were meant to resemble how Shouko's world was like, they were all vibrations and sounds that could be unintelligible but still heard and felt.Our characters grow throughout each act in the film, each character experiences an epiphany about their lives and begins to change. I would say the buildup to each character's development was done fairly well, although not every character is highlighted to the maximum.
The main plot of redemption shifts into something bigger, not only redemption is tackled by the story but themes of love and acceptance play a significant role towards the second and final act of the movie.Overall A Silent Voice is a great movie to watch, a real tearjerker as well. Its cinematography uses clever shots to show more than meets the eye and paired with its incredible soundtrack, it becomes immersive. The story is simple yet executed with grace. I recommend anyone to watch this movie, even if it is your first or 100th animated film, this movie will be sure to make you feel a wave of emotions.",A Silent Voice - The Movie

The entire story is a masterpiece, and that ending had me crying more than I've ever cried to any movie. It's so touching. Coming from someone who's seen a ton of sad anime, this movie really hits differently mainly because of the realism and relatable situations. I loved this movie for many reasons.

213,shathaalzayyat,Movie Analysis (Spoilers),10,29 December 2020,"Alright I think we can agree that the theme was not love but self-forgiveness. Ishida feels guilty about bullying Nishimiya and becomes depressed which leads to attempted suicide. He was determined to pay for what he did and shut everyone out which was shown with how the faces were covered from his perspective, and he wouldn't ever look them in the eye. Even people who talked about him mentioned several times that his head was always down and he had no friends. He also couldn't make any new friends after his middle school friends left him and blamed all the bullying that happened to Nishimiya on him and him alone. Later in the movie when he starts making friends, even with his extremely low self-esteem, he starts doubting himself and feeling even more guilty that he shouldn't be having fun and felt like he had to 'pay for what he did'. This changes when he finally starts crying at the end of the movie when he accepts his real friendship with Nishimiya and not as something he had to do to repay her. That's when he forgives himself and accepts him past. Overall the movie was so beautifully written with amazing animations and really had me connected with both main protagonists, Ishida with his journey as a former bully, and Nishimiya as a victim of bullying and also attempted suicide. ALSO! THE MUSIC! The OST in one of the most shocking moments when Nishimiya was about to commit suicide left me absolutely breathless. It's both beautiful and exciting and left you at the edge of your seat. Idk if u noticed but the transitions between some more dramatic phrases said by Ishida's friends that gave Ishida flashbacks blew me away. The main theme of the movie also talks about bullying, karma, depression, suicide, forgiveness and so on. I understand why some people wanted to see a love story form between the two but I feel like that would've been too unrealistic and cliché because it was overall talking about self-reflection and deciding whether your actions were right or wrong. Such a complicated and general topic that can be discussed endlessly portrayed in the simplest of ways in this film. Absolutely beautiful and very enjoyable! I would recommend to new anime watchers and normies too 😆😌

215,e_mi_li_a,A Silent Voice - Review,9,18 January 2021,"Ishida carries the image of a bully with him since primary school which was resonated in his own insecurities. He starts to cope with this troublesome past by fading his surroundings and hardly connects to anyone around him. Until the day, when Tomohiro Nagatsuka taught him what friendship looks and feels like. So step by step, Shoya starts to open up and connect to certain people in his life including Shoko. To process his past, he felt responsible for Shoko's happiness who he'd used to bully for her inability to hear. With each step towards her, he learned about Shoko's real emotions and unravels the meaning of moving on in life. The story is capturing in a way that it connects the protagonist's past and present experiences and pictures feelings like rejection and depression from an empathetic point of view. The animation was leading the audience with the choice of soft colors and the presentation of little details that helped to understand the characters and their choices. The music was used discreetly but appropriate to the scenery, wrapping up the overall experience as enjoyable and recommendable to everyone who resonates with the struggles of growing up and finding their way out of the past and into the present.",A Silent Voice - The Movie

And this movie, for me, is not a romantic film, but a movie tackle issues of bully and repentance. By facing past mistakes, all main characters can finally get their foot to future, instead of sticking in traumatized memories. But, with only two hours long, it's a shame that some supporting roles can not have fully time to construct their personalities, making them like flat characters comparable to original manga series which have more conversation with protagonists.

The bullying went to such great extreme that Shouka needed to change her school . Shoya only realized his own actions after he had been subjected to the same by his friends.

223,sarap1300,You must see this film!,10,5 March 2018,"There is seldom a movie with such complexity and nuance as Naoko Yamada's Koe No Katachi, known in English as A Silent Voice. Right off the bat, the English title loses much in translation. A direct translation would actually be The Shape of Voice, which, as the movie progresses, is a much more descriptive and meaningful title.
 
At its most basic plot point, it is the story of two young people who are dealing with the ramifications of bullying, self-hatred, and a search for redemption and acceptance. In the opening scene, teenager Shoya Ishida is climbing the ledge of a bridge, intending to commit suicide. He's interrupted by the sound of children playing with fireworks. He stops what he's doing, and then the film launches into a series of flashbacks. As a 6th-grader, Shoya is a rambunctious kid, easily bored and always looking for action. Then one day, a new student, Shoko Nishimiya, comes to class. Shoko happens to be Deaf, and carries a notebook with her so that she can communicate with her hearing classmates. The class accepts her with curiosity, eager to be her ""helper"" as she goes through the school day. But as children are wont to do at that age, the classmates soon tire of their new responsibility and their interest and curiosity soon wanes. Students slowly begin to take frustration out on Shoko, including Shoya. In fact, Shoya becomes relentless in his bullying, ripping out Shoko's hearing aids and tossing them into the water. The bullying becomes so bad, in fact, that Shoko's mother complains to the school, and the teacher demands someone be punished. Naturally, all fingers point to Shoya. His mother, a single mom, has to dig into her savings to repay Shoko's mother for the lost hearing aids, and to beg for forgiveness for her son's behavior.
From then on, Shoya becomes the brunt of everyone's ire. He has become a pariah, labeled the school bully. Meanwhile, Shoko tries desperately to befriend him and teach him Sign Language. He wants nothing to do with her. Shoko's mother removes her from the school and has her placed in a different school.And so begins their journey. As time passes, Shoya does what he can to make amends for his behavior in the past. He takes Sign Language lessons. He searches for Shoko to see if she can ever forgive him. He isolates himself from everyone at school and refuses to look anyone in the eye. He works to earn money to pay his mother back. It is at this point he had made that decision to end his own life, luckily stopping to reflect. What he doesn't know is that Shoko has her own demons to fight, part of which has to do with her family's reaction to her hearing loss. She is the one deaf child in her family. Her sister and grandmother learn signs, but her mother does not. And Shoko is continually made to feel inferior. She keeps a pleasant smile on her face, trying desperately not to cause anyone unhappiness. Secretly, though, she is filled with self-loathing and wonders if the world would be better off without her.When the two finally reconnect, they are still hampered by their own self-recriminations. Their journey has only begun.Yamada is a master at using symbolic references. Everything in this movie has layers of meaning. Shoko's notebook is a physical representation of her desire to be accepted. A koi pond figures prominently in the movie, referencing our two protagonists' harsh journey to find meaning. Daisies grow defiantly through the cracks in cement, literally demonstrating the blossoming of their self-discovery and the resilience of youth.It's a beautifully orchestrated movie, utilizing sight-and sound-to convey all the complexities of life. In fact, there are several scenes where the music is discordant and slightly muted, almost mechanical. Maybe it's a way of demonstrating the way that Shoko hears. But it's also a way of demonstrating how both Shoko and Shoya feel about themselves.Without a doubt, this is one of the best movies made in 2017. While it is a fantasy of sorts, it is well grounded in the realities of adolescence, and should be considered for serious review. It is certainly a coming of age movie, encompassing all of the angst that teenagers go through as they navigate relationships. At first glance, several of the characters seem almost flat-or like a caricature. There's the pretty girl, the mean girl, the tom boy, the cool kid, the wannabe. These are the typical roles kids take on in school. But Yamada reminds us that no one is a caricature. We are all multifaceted beings with our own personal hopes and fears, and within this film we see those hopes and fears played out again and again, sometimes as comic relief. Sometimes with tragic consequences.At the heart of this movie is this desire to be heard. But before one can be heard, one has to stop and listen. Both Shoya and Shoko are trying to communicate and find forgiveness, but before that can happen they both need to learn how to forgive themselves and they both need to learn how to listen to each other. Really listen. Really see. Because voice isn't always audible. Voice takes shape in a number of ways. And part of growing up is finding that voice and sharing that voice with others. Yamada asks us ""What do you sound like to others? What shape is your voice?""",A Silent Voice - The Movie
224,yeaitsben,Too Many Things Unexplainable,5,28 October 2017,"You may have read so many reviews about this movie, I'll just say that I agree about the positive comments about the voice actors and of course the animation. Pure art. But, these are what I think that ruined the beautiful concept of the movie:1. So many things left void. For example Ueno's character resolution, the white haired guy's existence, etc;2. Character developments are complete dull. What I'm saying here is, so, Nagatsuka's role is just to comfort Ishida? I thought there would be some interesting background about him, that will somehow connect to Ishida's resolution. Another example, how about Kawai's? It's never clear that she still has that blame-for-my-own-benefit character;3. Well, I don't think that the director wanted this film a pure romance, but... Still, I think that would be good if AT LEAST Ishida replied back Shoya properly, about her confession earlier. It doesn't matter how, but that just would be better if being put explicitly. Why is it matter? I think the answer is simple, Shoya's love for Ishida was also the reason that she attempted suicide. She thought that because of her existence Ishida suffered, unhappy. So wouldn't it be nicer if that love matter being solved clearly in the end?4. The story is confusing. At first I thought that the ending will be Ishida and Shoya being together, but I guess it won't. Then I thought it will end with a beautiful resolution, that Ueno and the whoever dudes involved in the story from the past, get together along again in the friendship, but I guess that's wrong too. So what? I don't even understand why Ishida started to not able to see people's faces. I thought because Ishida's rumor that he was a bully was spreading, but I guess after people accepted him (in the end when Shoya walked him to his class), he still couldn't face them. So, what was the cause? Also didn't he just promised God that he won't run away from reality anymore if Shoya's save? Why would he just break that promise right after he made that promise? Well, I don't really get it.2 hours of waiting for resolution, in the end it just appeared that Ishida could finally see people's faces again.Really disappointed, because the concept is just already so beautiful, heartwarming, and unique for me.5 out of 10 because the concept is really beautiful, and Shoya's heart is just pure and heartwarming. I actually learned a lot from her about life.",A Silent Voice - The Movie

This story gets you invested in the individual personalities of most characters better than any other film I've seen this decade. The entire cast is relatable, and this is part of what makes this film so powerful. The first part of the movie dives into how the two main characters grew to know each other at first and it's hard to watch at times. Even though these two characters are drastically different at the surface level, I was able to find myself relating to both, and by the end of the first act I felt somewhat sympathetic toward Ishida even though he did horrific things. This first act really carried it's weight and didn't shy away from the life long consequences that bullying has on everyone involved. This was an amazing movie, and I can recommend it to anyone. I will briefly mention how beautiful the animation is throughout the film because it would be an injustice not too. The entire movie is animated phenomenally, and even shifts styles depending on the perspective of certain characters which isn't seen often in the industry.",A Silent Voice - The Movie

IT'S ASTONISHIGLY BEAUTIFUL!,9,10 May 2020,"A Silent Voice may be one of the movies that have hit me the hardest ever, it's just such an honest representation of depression, self-hatred, anxiety, and accepting yourself. Or at least trying to. The main character Ishida is such a fleshed-out character, he was socially pressured into believing that bullying was good and ended up bullying Nishimiya, a girl who he bullied for being deaf. And even though she tried to fit in and to be nice to people, her classmates and he was still were mean to her for being different. She left school due to it, and since after that, he has felt guilty for doing so. He hates himself, he feels alone and horrible, all his classmates hate him and at the end, he feels that he doesn't even deserve love, He ends up attempting to end his own life. But he fails. The moment he meets Nishimiya again, his life has a purpose again, he wants to try to make it up to her.
His life takes a turn, he starts having friends, she becomes great friends with her and has some happiness, but he can still not get to love himself again, he pushes everyone away again and only wants to be with Nishimiya, and when she wants to jump off a building, for feeling non-deservant of life and friendship. She feels like a burden to everybody like she ruins everything and that the world would be happier without her. But, he comes to rescue her and ends up falling himself. She survives, but he ends up hospitalized. She goes on and makes up with everybody in her life, and finally starts finding her own self worth and that there are people that love her and want her alive. There might still be people who alienate her and dislike her for being different, but she will move on forward and see the positive side of life. And that these people's lives are better for her existence.
When he wakes up, he also finally faces himself and his insecurities. He goes and apologizes to her and to everybody who he has wronged, and finally stops seeing everybody as possible threats, but as possible friends. He finally starts to feel worthy of life. If he would have died on that bridge, he could have never lived the happiest moments in his life. He finally made it up, and now he can live happily with his new friends who love him and be able to love himself.I'm sorry for the long paragraphs, but I can't stress how much I loved this story. It represents perfectly how depression affects someone's life and that. Life is sacred, and I know it's sometimes hard to see, but the world is better because you are alive. Even if you don't know it, someone's life is better because of you :)The only issue is some of the characters (Kawai) are very unlikable, and the movie expects us to like them. It's pretty annoying, to be honest. But other than that, the movie was one of the most beautiful movies (I've seen).
This is a movie I won't forget, I honestly think this movie is the best depiction of mental illnesses and how teenagers are affected by it. I've never read the manga and I also don't know how it is to be deaf, but as someone who knows a thing or two about mental illnesses and dealing with being ""different"", this movie really hits hard.(also the art and animation are great)I give Koe no Katachi a high 9/10.",A Silent Voice - The Movie

Nishimiya thought theres no point living in this world. She thought better die than she alive. She tried to suicide.When Ishida start to jhs, his old friends talk to another student about his past, talk about story of he likes to bullying other people in the past primary school.
Its make Ishida has no friends. He scared. He scared to talk. He scared to action at school. And makes he always alone. He has no friends. He just have his mother, sister and his cousin. But his family have finance problem.
He being ""depressed""....
He tired for everything, and he tried to suicide too.The point is......
When you have family you have to support them no matter what. You have to ask your family about their problems daily and make conclusions together for better future.
And if you have friend, support them too. If you have problem or bullying in your circle school, you have to talk to some botherer and tell them to stop doing that bad things. If that a person is a victim you have to support them.If you loved your family and your friends, you should understand them. You should always beside them. You should wipe their tears and make them happy. And dont let them feel alone. Dont let them think they useless. Dont let them think they dont have anyone. Dont let them try to hurt them self or suicide.
You have to be the kind of people who can make them happy. It will be helped someone.Theres are things what make us happy.
A place where everyone smiled.A someone that everyone wouldn't leave no matter what happen.A home when we want to back.A family to talk and listen about complaints.A friend to cheers you up and wipe your tears.",A Silent Voice - The Movie

254,mandaloriancommando,Unexpected...,9,11 June 2020,"Let me preface this review by saying I'm not generally a fan of Japanese animation. Maybe it's just a lack of exposure. A point about about this movie that interested me was that it involves a deaf character. As I've been learning sign language for awhile what they would do with that characteristic. While it does factor in, the movie on the whole is just a great film about the difficulties we can all have with fitting in, expressing ourselves, and how valuable friendship can be. You forget that it's a foreign film, animated, etc and just become engrossed in the emotional story being portrayed onscreen. There are a number of backgrounds displayed by different characters and I believe everyone will be able to relate to at least a couple. Ultimately, I hope everyone comes out of watching this film with a bit more empathy for the people around them, even if they don't seem very relatable at first. Great movie. And--it's on Netflix right now!",A Silent Voice - The Movie

Must watch, don't underestimate it as it is just anime movie.",A Silent Voice - The Movie
260,dh-88516,One of the few movies I consider a masterpiece,10,8 December 2020,"Everything about this movie is stunning and mind blowing. The writing for all of the characters, the beautiful animation, the angelic score, and the atmosphere that is built throughout the movie stand out the most. From here on out is where the spoilers are, so here's your final warning.The writing is absolutely incredible and makes the characters (specifically Yuzuru, Nishimiya, and Ishida) so relatable. Ishida's struggle to find a reason to live and his hesitation to accept it once he's found one feels so real. The way he drowns out everything and everyone in the beginning, but learns to open up to others after he meets with Nishimiya for the first time because of her influence on him. Nishimiya is probably the most relatable for me, because even though she has been the victim all these years she still believes that everything is her fault. Those thoughts plagued her mind and drove her to attempt suicide. Nishimiya is such an interesting character even though she doesn't speak very much. My favourite thing about her in the English dub is how clear her speaking is depending on how confident she is. When she's talking to Sahara (towards the end of the movie), her voice is clear because she's determined and confident, but when she's confessing to Ishida her voice is hard to understand due to a lack of confidence (at least that's how I interpret it). Yuzuru is also an interesting character, though is a little overshadowed because of how great Nishimiya and Ishida are. She's cold to people she doesn't know, but really she only wants to protect her sister (I know there's less to say about Yuzuru than the other two, but they're the main characters so obviously I'm going to have more to say about them).The score and animation are another part of this movie that make it a joy to watch. The animation is enough to make me tear up, it's realistic while still staying true to anime's style. The backgrounds are stunning, the water is about as realistic as it can be for anime, and each of the characters has colour schemes that compliment the background and other characters as well. The background characters always look less colourful than Ishida until the end when he stops avoiding them and gains the courage to look them in the eyes. The score makes every scene 1000% times better, as it adds to the already beautiful and tense atmosphere and makes the most emotional scenes even sadder/happier.Finally I want to talk about the brilliance of the ending. It defied expectations and (in my opinion) was the most emotional scene in the movie. The entire movie was building up to this moment, and they (the creators) executed it flawlessly. In a way it's similar to the leap of faith scene from Spiderman Into The Spiderverse. Miles spends the whole movie running from his problems, and when he finally gains the courage (because of influence and support) to take his leap of faith. Ishida spends the whole movie (excluding the child parts) hiding his face and running away from his problems, and when he finally gains the courage (once again because of influence and support) to basically take a leap of faith. However, even though he had gained courage, that doesn't mean he wasn't nervous. His slight hesitation is like Miles when he rips his fingers off of the building because he's scared. The whole movie built up to him gaining enough courage to open up to others, and it started with Nishimiya, She was his influence, just as the other spider people were Miles' influence.I'm going to conclude this with something I have only ever said about 1 other movie. A Silent Voice is perfect in every way. There isn't a thing I would change, there isn't something that could've been done better. It's perfect. If you haven't watched it I recommend you do it ASAP. A Silent Voice is a must watch 100%.",A Silent Voice - The Movie

Lastly, I bielieve that Shoyas inability to look people in the eye being shown through x's on people's faces unless he's friends with them was one of the best displays of that uncomfortable emotion I've ever witnessed in a movie.

282,ancifiregigibow,Exceptional,9,24 June 2019,"Rare is the movie that can convey strength, vulnerability and truth in such a harrowing, yet utterly tender way. Social media are teeming with inspirational quotes and posters about change and acceptance, but true change isn't as easy as posting a picture or leaving a comment and it seldom comes without a price. When you look in the mirror, do you really see the change you crave for from the world? When was the last time you befriended someone you initially disliked, the last time you talked to someone outside your immediate social circle, someone of different background, race, religion, belief system? A Silent Voice carries that message and asks us to cast aside the mask and truly step into the world. During its two hour runtime, it made me cry more times than I'm willing to admit. It is a movie of unparalleled beauty and quiet bravery, a movie that speaks honestly about acceptance of others as well as ourselves, about disability, social hierarchy, trauma, guilt, isolation, self-loathing, the unspoken sacrifices we're asked to make in order to grow up, the bleak childhood pictures that haunt us well into adulthood, the pain of causing pain, the bonds we make and the losses we suffer.",A Silent Voice - The Movie
283,eric-lovelock,Trying to Redeem the Irredeemable,4,30 January 2018,"Yeah, this is a ""pretty"" movie. The animation is nice, the character designs are pretty solid, and the voice actors are all good in their own right. The problem with this movie isn't technical, because from a Visual aspect it's all very good. The issue is in it's main story, scratch that, it's with the main characters.The central plot device here is following the main character, Shoya, who ruthlessly bullied a deaf girl in elementary school until she was forced to switch schools. There are other characters too, a lot of other (to the movie's credit, believably written) characters who also partake in this cruelty, in what is a very well done portrayal of the escalation of torment for kids. The issue is what comes after, in which suddenly Shoya is supposed to be this sympathetic character. That's the chief problem, this movie tries to make you feel badly for someone who has no right to be pitied. It's about him trying to make amends, like that will undo everything and make the world all pretty again. Other characters are there too, and overall they all fall into this central theme, and problem, in that the film seems to assume that just because you feel ""Bad"" about something, that makes it okay.These characters go around acting like feeling bad because they were cruel justifies it, that just because they're ""sorry"" they're suddenly absolved of sin. The film milks this dry and keeps trying to kick you in the gut, but it fails because there's no way this mentality can be sympathized with. Feeling sorry for yourself because you were a bully doesn't render your actions void, it doesn't make everything better, and the damage they've caused never goes away. As much as the film wants you to think that everyone is secretly good, it never gives me reason to believe as such. They haven't learned anything, they're just as selfish and mean as they used to be, they just learned how to make it SEEM different. One of the characters hates Shoko (The deaf girl), slaps her repeatedly, tells her that she hates her TO HER FACE, blames her for her problems, and then suddenly at the end we're supposed to think she's good just because she feels bad later. In conclusion, it's a visually engaging film, but it's skewed perspective of ""redemption"" drags it down and makes it impossible to empathize with anything it presents.",A Silent Voice - The Movie
284,vincentkatie,A Must Watch Movie!,10,16 June 2017,"Another, fantastic, Brilliant work of art by Kyoto Animation alongside Trigger studio, MadHouse and of course Studio Ghibli and many more theses are the studios that lead the anime world, In my opinion. Koe no katachi or A silent voice is honestly one of my favorite anime alongside Spirited Away from the animation alone is brilliant, when I first saw the trailer I feel in love and knew it was going to be up there as one of my favorite but actually seeing, the story is well done, follows the Manga well, the Manga characters are explored a lot more in depth then the movie but the movie is like 2 hours 10 minutes long it would be difficult to add 7 volumes worth of content into that time frame but Kyoto Animations did the manga justice, I would recommend the Manga author/artist Oima Yoshitoki its a brilliant Manga I would beyond recommend the anime its doesn't matter what one you read/watch first the movie covers the main bulk of the manga. In my opinion one of the best movies, it has sensitive subject matters but deals with them with respect and such a beautiful message when you watch the films I would also recommend looking more into reviews and other views on it and theory's they really make you...Smile :)Story. 10/10 As I said before sensitive subjects, well executed though.Animation. 10/10 Its Kyoto Animations...I will leave it at that. Music. 10/10 Yeah brilliant the opening was unexpected but not unwelcome, the tone change that happens after the opening was brilliant and the music throughout was fantastic. Characters. 10/10 (As I said manga goes in more depth but the movie goes into the characters quite well you feel like you understand motives etc.) Also I bow to the voice actress of Nishimiya Shōko (Saori Hayami)just beautiful. Enjoyment. 10/10 I'll be honest I cried, like four times but that is just me I get emotional with my anime but still didn't stop me loving this anime in fact I love it even more. listen I just cant get enough of this anime just.

289,angzep,It's not romantic,9,2 August 2019,A lot of people say there's romance but it's about a boy making things right for a girl he bullied in the past. Throughout the movie they never kiss or admit they want to date or be a couple. There is one seen where the girl saids I love you.

It is a story about relationships, growing up and redemption. Ishida who bullied a deaf and mute girl in school becomes the victim of alienation and ignorance in his subsequent years. He doesn't remember friendship and is on the verge of killing himself. Seeing the girl that he bullied in his formative years again changes everything.This anime has a strong character development, we see a loner learning to live again and even make some friends. Don't get fooled by the cutesy looks, the anime has deep and dark undertones which are very prevalent in today's society. Overall a great anime which shows it is never too late to forgive yourself.",A Silent Voice - The Movie
291,darkwarriorkeita,Good Movie,7,24 May 2017,"First I never had the chance to read the manga so I'll give my points on what I've seen in the movie.For me, this movie is fresh yet bold. It talks about the real life issue - which is bullying and how this affects a person's life. The movie shows different angles of guilt from one character and then to the next and how they managed or trying to fix the issue they're having personally.Another thing I like about this movie is phasing. The movie lets the story be told in such an intricate and interesting manner. For me, this movie is a success showing the main issue and that's what I'm really looking forward when watching a movie.Unfortunately, I was so **mislead** by the title of the movie.Watching it from the start down to the scene where Nishimiya decided to suicide, I thought this movie is leaning towards romance. But I was wrong. There's a lot of characters in the movie which does not explain why they bullied Nishimiya. I wish that they give a little bit more of a backstory of why they do that.Also, the story focuses on Ishida which is a normal person. Since it's not a romance movie and more of like bullying, I believe that being deaf is no longer needed. It could be any type of bullying. But I guess they're just sticking with the manga.Lastly, in the final scene, I'm thinking that Ishida would figure out what's the meaning of the three animal candies Nishimiya gave but he wasn't, so I feel that the ending is still unfinished.Overall, it is still a good movie to watch! Two thumbs up! and really looking forward to watching other anime and even reading the manga.",A Silent Voice - The Movie

299,lukesaner,The silent beauty of a Silent Voice.,9,26 January 2018,"A Silent Voice is an emotional and beautiful movie that almost anyone can relate to in some shape or form.The story is both heart wrenching and heartwarming, as it tackles many issues such as bullying, social anxiety, depression, and suicide. Many of the characters deal with some or all of these issues. The issues the characters deal with in the past ultimately lead them into becoming what they are in the present movie. There are many characters in a Silent Voice with some shining more than others. Shoya is a great main protagonist who (unlike most movies) is battling something much bigger in his life, his past self. The other main character Shoko is outstanding. You can really genuinely feel all her emotions just through her facial animations alone. Other notable characters I enjoyed were Shoya's best friend Tomohiro (who brought a nice comedic presence to the film) and Shoko's little sister Yuzuru. My only problem with a Silent Voice is with a couple of side characters who show up once and a while, but don't really contribute as much to the film - this is only a small nitpick though.The majority of the music in a Silent Voice is played only by piano making the film take a more somber tone. This makes a lot of scenes feel more peaceful and calm contradicting what many of the characters feel deep down inside. 
The song titled ""Lit"" is a beautiful piano piece that I believe would make anyone emotional, when listening to it. So I enjoyed a lot of music in a Silent Voice with a couple of songs that really stood out.The animation in this movie is absolutely gorgeous. There's a firework scene that is beautiful, it definitely is the animation highlight in this film...it's breathtaking.In conclusion, I absolutely love this film. Everything feels so genuine and the characters feel so real. It really feels like there was a lot of love and care put into this movie and it definitely shows. This movie made me cry and I can almost assure you that it will do the same to you.

302,svndellons,This movie was wonderful,10,10 March 2018,"I rate A Silent Voice a solid 9.5/10. I'd recommend to for it's beautiful animations done by Kyoto Animation and the beautifully written story by Reiko Yoshida. The poster art may come off as a romantic anime movie, but I think it would be more accurate to describe it as a modern tale of heartfelt moments and tragedy. The main character of the story Shoya is shown as a playful boy, but after Shoko, a deaf girl, transfers into his elementary school. He finds her disability disgusting and starts to bully her. The bullying eventually gets to the point where she has the adults involved and eventually transfers away. However, during the time in between these two events and after Shoya gets bullied. He recieves his karma for his actions more and more before he realizes he might not have any friends. I would recommend this movie to others if you want a sad, but heartfelt movie. I would rate this movie a 9.5/10 and not a 10/10 for one reason. I was disappointed that the part where Shoya visits his elementary school and confronts the teacher about his past, from the original manga, was left out of the film. 
To refute a certain critique, who says many things have been left void, I say do you not see the story line. Although the beginning skips a bit in time, the rest of the film goes in chronological order. If you are asking what were the other characters doing during their time away from Shoya and Shoko they were doing their own things. This is shown when everyone is shown watching fireworks, revealing to your surprise they have a life out side of the story. This certain critI rate A Silent Voice a solid 9.5/10.

This certain critique continues on that the character developments were dull. What was dull about the characters? They each had their own personalities and ways of thinking. Yuzuru was a caring sister who wanted to help her sister after hearing of her sister's troubles. Ueno was bit of jerk, but showed she really did care about Shoya by trying to help him make up with his old friends to go back to his good old days. Their are many other characters that were flushed out, but I do see how a character such as Toshi Mashibasa was not really flushed out as a character, since his segment with Shoya from the original works were not adapted, but overall there was definitely character development that you either missed or ignored.
This certain reviewer continues tries to point out Shoko's confession to Shoya that she had feelings for him was a stupid moment for Shoya. Have you actually understood that it was hard for him to understand her. I could see how the translation seems weird since it was a misunderstanding done with Japanese word play, but it is quite simple to understand that she spoke in way that it was hard for him to understand. You also say if he accepted her confession it would have prevented Shoko's attempt at suicide, but do you really think it was because of her failure to convey her feelings at that time, rather than the argument that essentially revolved her and Shoya split the group of friends? The reviewer continues on that they were disappointed that Shoya and Shoko did not become a pair. I personally don't see the proper argument for this at all. I do see how the poster art is misleading, but I thought it was shown this was not a love story when he could not understand her confession. The movie gives it that one scene and is it. They are just close friends. This reviewer continues on that he promised god that he would face his disasters and this was frustrating to them since he broke the promise. He did eventually come to terms with everyone when all of the X's on their faces fell off. The movie shows he has extreme trust issues with the literal X's illustrating how he views people his age. This reasoning was even shown during his montage to a high schooler, when he was bullied by his closest childhood friends. He was isolated, beaten, and was talked badly about to others ruining his own reputation. His closest friends were something he couldn't think of as friends and caused him to be traumatized. Your argument of the promise is no stronger than a New Years resolution, but instead of losing weight it was a promise to overcome his past trauma ique continues on that the character developments were dull.

303,firestorm-29625,Sorry if this movie review is bad I did it for my English class,9,9 March 2018,"One of my favorite movies of all time is koe no Katachi which is a Japanese animated film. I love this essay because the animation is vibrant and beautiful , the characters are fun and loveable, and the plot is quite different. The movie is about a group of grade schoolers who recently had a new student join their class but there is one problem, she is deaf. The class at first doesn't really interact with her much because of her disability and some downright don't like her. The main character in the movie named shouko is just a kid who hasn't yet been taught manners. Everyone in the class thinks he is hilarious, he is the one who harasses shoya the most by doing all sorts of terrible stuff to her. But one day he takes her hearing aid and ends up hurting her. Even though she endures all of this, she try's to be friends with everyone. Everything then comes to a stop when the principle comes to discus that shouko is being builled, and shoya is the one everyone blames even though he wasn't the only one. Shouko ends up transferring away, and the class turns against shoya. He ends up being the most hilarious to most hated, it's like night and day for Shoya. Everyone treats him like how he treated shouko telling him to get lost. He then goes on with his schooling with no friends which totally changes him, he becomes quite, introverted, and unsociable.This movie is great because it is such an emotional movie that shows you that you should treat everyone you meet with kindness. It really humbles your ego by showing how this boy was trying to be funny but in the end no one liked him. You go from hating him to almost feeling bad for him. Even though he did all this cruel stuff to her I felt bad because everyone makes mistakes in there lives. Some mistakes are being then others which means the punishment is greater. Shoya ends up going to sign language school to try and make amends with Shouko and himself. I really liked the fact that he realizes that he messed up bad and try's repent for his sins. This movie really makes you think before you say anything in life becasue the decisions you make can drasticly affect your life for the better or good. The animation of the movie koe no Katachi is so spectacular. The colors of this movie are very vibrant and warm even though most of the story is quite sad. This movie because of its animation has won best screen play in Japan. Many of the characters in the movie are easy to get attached to and well put together. Each character is very unique and has its own place in the story. Without these characters the movie would have been quite bland. The story is quite different then most storylines but I am glad it was like this because it truly puts you in a roller coaster of emotion. The movie tackles the topic of mental health, well being and as well as redemption. I feel this is a topic lots of people can relate with. This movie shows us how devastating depression and anxiety is to someone, and how even though this people have depression or unhealthy mental they are still trying to find redemption for there actions.",A Silent Voice - The Movie
304,macintoshplus,An Experience for Everyone,9,8 June 2018,"A Silent Voice tackles multiple very sensitive subject matters, and does so in a way that can be difficult to watch at times. On the other hand, I personally feel that when these things are portrayed correctly it can elevate the story to a whole new level. The themes and messages that A Silent Voice sends to it's viewers are essential, and ones that everyone should experience for them selves thorough this film, and maybe even through your everyday life. From a technical standpoint the movie is one of the best looking pieces of animation ever produced by Kyoto Animation, and possibly one of the best ever made in general. The film is accompanied by gorgeous sound and editing along with a fantastic score. The film is filled with beautiful uses of lighting and color that make it's scenes of nature and just everyday life something to behold. The film isn't perfect it does have its flaws, but very few at that. Taking from Chris Stuckmans review of A Silent Voice, the movie does feature some scenes that feel unnecessary at times that can add to its long runtime of 2 hours of 10 minutes( though I personally didn't mind it).Overall just go watch the movie",A Silent Voice - The Movie
305,sirshahzeb,Richly decorated Masterpiece,10,8 September 2019,"It is one of the most beautiful films i have watched till now
I just loved every part of it
It's a one in a million movie
A must watch
I have already watched it more than 5 times",A Silent Voice - The Movie
306,evadetroy,My favorite film to this day,10,19 May 2018,"I have watched this for the first time less than 24 hours ago, and have already found myself re watching this masterpiece looking at all the small story-line implications. Would love a sequel to be made although this is unlikely as the film is based on a manga and covered all the books",A Silent Voice - The Movie
307,omairahameed,A masterpiece,10,16 November 2019,One of the most beautiful and subtle studies of human interaction and ability to adapt. Complemented with an equally beautiful score and soundtrack. An excellent adaptation which hooks you in for repeat viewings and so masterfully crafted that you will notice and appreciate previously missed aspects with each viewing. Naoko Yamada is a genius and has added another feather in Kyoani's cap.,A Silent Voice - The Movie
308,prasnaaudri,A great ambiance of a not-romance-movie,8,13 November 2018,"Anime is never really my first choice of a movie. Perhaps it's because I rarely encountered it in local theatres but really, I probably should pay more attention to them. This is coming from a mouth of someone who is definitely not an anime connoisseur, but A Shape of Voice is brilliant.(Spoiler Alert!) First of all, it's not a romance movie; it is a story about overcoming depression, friendship and growing up. Some people may mistake it as a romance movie: in a way, it is, but it does not romanticize depression. Also, they do a perfect job at representing social anxiety. The way they put X(s) on people's faces that Shoya refused to look at? Amazing. Not only he does not want to physically look at them, he also refuses to open himself up to them.I really love the scene sequences where the bully became someone who is bullied. The scenes give me the perspective of the simple-minded child Shoya Ishida as a bully and him growing up getting bullied because of it. He learns his lessons and that makes sympathy towards the protagonist come easier for me.I also like how they made the animation to characterize the changing of the characters. For example, Nishimiya had short hair when she was an elementary school but the creators change it into long hair to create a mature character. And also the character Shoya Ishida when he was still an elementary school and bullying Nishimiya, the creator makes his eye to look sharp however they change it with eyes that has sad look when Ishida became someone bullied.The backsound of the movie is excellent. For example in the beginning of the story, the movie creators use the soundtrack with a little rock music that is fitted with the scene of the movie which is introducing the characters. I think the music is a right choice for describing a young characters who are still doing something reckless. Just like the story line, most of the scene is filled with sad backsound music with only a piano accompaniment. The scoring of the movie is also great. They tried to adjust the sound effect with what is actually happened in the scene.Overall this movie is a very-well self lesson to learn about how valuable your life is and to respect the others as well.Thank you very much!",A Silent Voice - The Movie
