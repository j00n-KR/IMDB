0,MartinHafer,Just plain weird....and I'm cool with that.,8,26 August 2007,"This is a truly odd little film from Britain that in spite of a rather low budget still packs an amazing punch. Edward Woodward stars as a police inspector sent to a small island off the Scottish coast to investigate the disappearance of a girl. However, when he arrives he's greeted very coldly and the locals all say they have never even heard of the child. However, as the film progresses, it becomes obvious that the locals are all a bunch of lying weasels, as Woodward is able to prove that the girl DID exist and that there is a massive conspiracy among everyone--but what, exactly, it is isn't certain. At the same time, the traditional and Christian man, Woodward, is deservedly shocked to find that the locals are all pagans. The community indulges in sex outdoors, naked fertility dances for the children and nature worship--like a group of modern day Wikkans. Where all this takes Woodward and the extremely wild but disturbing ending are all parts of the plot I really can't mention, as it would ruin the suspense, but believe me, it is REALLY, REALLY weird and haunting.Now parents must understand that this is a very, very adult movie and comes by its R rating honestly. Not only should it receive the rating because it's pretty scary, but there is quite a bit of nudity. Many adults will be amazed at the beauty of Britt Ekland's body double as she dances very seductively, but most sane parents won't want their kids watching this. If the film were only slightly edited, it would be appropriate for teens.Also, while some might find that the movie might have an anti-Christian slant, I would disagree (though I am sure the copious amounts of nudity make it problematic for some). While the town is full of pagans and they seem to have an idyllic life, Woodward's character is not some angry or hypocritical Christian and he doggedly stays with his convictions throughout the film.Once you've seen this movie on DVD, try to watch the ""making of"" featurette. It has lots of great insights and information that make the movie come alive. However there is one mistake in it, as they say that THE WICKER MAN is totally unique and while it is unusual, it is strongly inspired by Shirley Jackson's story, ""The Lottery"" and also is quite similar to the American made for TV film THE DARK SECRET OF HARVEST HOME (1978). If you like THE WICKER MAN, try to find another great film with similarities that also stars Christopher Lee--HORROR HOTEL, which is about a modern town of witches bent on evil.",The Wicker Man
1,TheLittleSongbird,Very effective psycho-sexual horror-thriller,8,18 May 2010,"Playing on our fears of ""the other"", this 1973 film has attained classic status. I don't think it is quite a classic, there are parts that do move slowly and others that feel somewhat stilted. Regardless, it is still extremely good, with a brilliant script and impressive locations and cinematography. The story is also very effective, and the ending is another great strength, being quite shocking. That is the thing about the Wicker Man, it is bizarre and it is disturbing but that works in the film's favour in alternative to against it. The acting is very well done, as is Robin Hardy's direction. Edward Woodward does a good job as the prudish Sergeant Howie and Britt Ekland is beautifully seductive as the pub landlord's free spirited daughter. But in my opinion, it is the magnificent Christopher Lee who walks away with the film as the mysterious Lord Summerisle. Overall, while not quite a classic, it is still a very effective psycho-sexual horror-thriller, that was bastardised by a completely unnecessary remake with Nicolas Cage. 8/10 Bethany Cox",The Wicker Man
2,Leofwine_draca,A towering classic of the British horror scene,10,4 December 2016,"One of the quintessential British horror movies of the 1970s, as reckoned in the many books to come out on the subject in recent years (Ten Years of Terror is recommended reading to any fan of the genre), THE WICKER MAN is a truly unique film which succeeds in being a true horror film. Yet there are no vampires or monsters here, no bloodshed, violence, or gore. Instead, the film starts off deceptively slowly, taking care to characterise Woodward's central figure and paint a complex picture of the community of Summerisle into which he comes. Then the clues begin to fall together, the suspense builds up rapidly and POW!, the film hits you with one of the most stunning climaxes ever seen in a horror film.For the most part, this doesn't even feel like a horror film, just a study of a community of pagans and heathens. Upstanding Christian Howie is of course shocked by all the so-called depravity he sees around him (couples copulating in fields at night; young girls dancing naked through fires; reproduction and reincarnation taught at the local school) and tries desperately to uphold his moral values when temptress Britt Ekland dances naked into the room next to his at night. The movie is beautifully shot, as seen in the opening shots of Howie's plane flying into the island; and the visuals are accompanied by plentiful folky music which helps to transfer the spirit of the islanders across, with many of the tunes being catchy and playful, not to mention melodic. When I learnt that THE WICKER MAN was actually filmed in 26-or-so separate locations I was shocked, because I was completely convinced that the community of Summerisle really did exist at first.What makes this film - and, in particular, the finale - so effective is its basis in reality. There are no showy or shouty performances, just matter-of-fact people going about their lives. No special effects or anything like that. Only vague hints of the darker things to come later in the movie - talk of crop failure and ritual sacrifice; the Hand of Glory appearing on Woodward's bedside; the whole story of the missing girl and the hare in her coffin. Towards the end, the film becomes a suspenseful actioner for a while as Woodward infiltrates the May Day celebrations in disguise and attempts to rescue the kidnapped girl, but then the twist ending arrives and turns everything around that you've previously seen, much like in THE SIXTH SENSE and no less effective.The finale is classic stuff and the image of the burning wicker man one of the most enduring in horror cinema. The moment in which Woodward first sees the figure and says ""oh, Jesus, no!"" still has the power to send a shiver down my spine although I've seen the movie half a dozen times. The shots of Woodward reciting the Lord's Prayer as the pigs squeal and burn is almost impossibly powerful and quite stunning - I've never seen anything like it. Forget CHILDREN OF THE CORN, THE WICKER MAN really is the last word on pagan worship and the theme has never been bettered.Edward Woodward puts in the performance of his career as the increasingly desperate Howie; a flawed and often laughable man, but still one you can identify with and sympathise with, and that's the key. Screen legend Christopher Lee enjoys what was his personally favourite performance as Lord Summerisle, and makes his character's convictions scarily convincing - a chilling turn, despite the fact that he is kind and courtly, or happy and laughing, for the majority of his appearance! Genre regulars Britt Ekland and Ingrid Pitt once again shed their inhibitions for the sake of their art to good effect, and each and every creepy islander is effective in his or her role, giving the film a truly scary conspiracy-style feel when the secrets are at last unearthed. Always watchable and truly enduring, THE WICKER MAN has achieved the interest it always deserved in recent years, with the final cut finally being released on Blu-ray format. This really is one of the best horror films to come out of the British Isles and maybe one of the best in screen cinema.",The Wicker Man
3,claudio_carvalho,A Different Horror Movie In an Unusual Environment,8,13 April 2004,"Sergeant Neil Howie (Edward Woodward) arrives in a Scottish private island looking for a missing teenager girl, Rowan Morrison (Geraldine Cowper). The place belongs to Lord Summerisle (Christopher Lee) and is famous because of their plantation of apples and other fruits and their harvest. Sgt. Howie realizes that the locals are pagans, practicing old rituals, and Rowan is probably alive and being prepared to be sacrificed. The end of the story is a tragic surprise. This movie is a different horror movie in all aspects: first, the environment, with beautiful and happy people, naked women, full of sunshine, love scenes and songs, contrasting with those dark and Gothic movies, with monsters or weird persons, taking place in the night, in shadowy castles or forests. The simple and original story, which has a surprising end, hooks the attention until the last scene. The cast, mainly Edward Woodward and Christopher Lee, has a great performance, especially in the duel of their religious beliefs. Just as a curiosity, when Britt Ekland dances naked in the inn, tempting Sgt. Howie, the beautiful and sexy body belongs to a double body. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): 'O Homem de Palha' ('The Straw Man')",The Wicker Man
4,kosmasp,Interesting it is,7,5 February 2007,"If you haven't seen above, I'm making it clear here too: This comment, does include ""spoiler"", which means, if you haven't seen the movie yet (or the remake) stop reading this review.An interesting story about a hunter becoming the hunted. But also a very predictable one. Even if you haven't watched that many movies, you kind of know where this one is going. To make matters worse, this guy is all alone on an island, where everybody seems to be crazy. Or indeed they are if we'd judge them by our civilized standards. So the ending is inevitable.Although I thought the guy could at least die a hero. If you remember the ending, he (the cop) comes out of the cave with the girl. He's standing over a cliff. He should then realise that there is no way out (no escaping the island) for him. While he's on the edge and Dr. Sommerisle (Christoper Lee) is standing there with him. Now while he might have still the survival instinct in him and tries to get away from there, it has to be clear to him that there is nowhere for him to go, when he sees the town folks appear on top of that cliff. They block any way for him to escape, so where does he try to go? He should've tried to tackle/grab Dr. Sommerisle and take a fall with him down to their certain deaths ... That's at least what I think would be right for this character to do ... but then you wouldn't have this climax ending with the fire, of course.Despite all that, this movie grabs you with the suspense that it is building (although in some parts it just is too long) and delivers very good acting performances. I've seen the 99 minutes version and the 80-something minutes version. The longer version has a more believable beginning, so I'd say it's the better one :o)",The Wicker Man
5,classicsoncall,"""You have come of your own free will to the appointed place.""",5,27 October 2021,"I don't know what I expected when I called up this movie on one of the streaming channels, but this certainly wasn't it. The film starts out with the intriguing premise of a police sergeant (Edward Woodward) attempting to locate a missing twelve year old girl on a small island off the coast of Scotland. With most of the villagers disavowing any knowledge of the young girl, and the girl's purported mother (Irene Sunters) even denying her existence, you get the sense of something malevolent going on in this closed community. And there is, but what it boils down to is a village steeped in paganism that relishes nudity and ritual sacrifice. This completely disorients the straight laced, Christian Sergeant Howie (Woodward), who nevertheless becomes convinced that the girl he's looking for is alive and somewhere on the island. One needs to consider that Rowan Morrison (Geraldine Cowper) was used as bait to lure an unsuspecting adult male to the island for the purpose of making him a human sacrifice victim to appease the nature gods and provide for a successful harvest the next growing season. The finale is quite horrific for the venerable Howie, who goes out like a martyr amidst a population of amoral citizens.Amidst all the ritualistic dancing and nudity, I was struck by one thing, and that was Mrs. Morrison's antidote for her other daughter's sore throat. It would never occur to me to relieve a frog in one's throat by placing a frog in one's throat.",The Wicker Man
6,gavin6942,"A Horror Classic, Timeless In Its Beauty",9,14 April 2007,"A police sergeant (Edward Woodward) is sent to a Scottish island village in search of a missing girl whom the townsfolk claim never existed. Stranger still are the rites that take place there. While the remake of this film was a complete travesty (see other review), it had the positive side effect of exposing the original to a new audience, myself included. I am grateful for this, because ""The Wicker Man"" is wonderful.The acting is great, with a very special appearance by Christopher Lee, and the scenery is beautiful. I enjoyed the directing, and I am especially partial to the music. One scene involving a nude dance was very 1970s but also timeless for its beauty (the nudity is purely aesthetic, not erotic).The best part of this film, though, is beyond a doubt the religious overtones. While you would expect the Christian detective to be the hero, he actually comes across as more of an oppressor. His condemnation of the simple ways of the islanders make him out to be the villain, despite being the protagonist of the story. I thought this was a very clever way to tell a story... something the remake completely ignored.This is ""horror"" in a very different sense than we know today. There is no fear, no scaring the audience and little or no gore (a trickle of blood once or twice). There is almost no violence, and even the nudity is lacking in sex. Yet, somehow, there is a horror undercurrent here due to the upheaval of mainstream values with unsettling alternatives. Awesome! I don't know if I could more highly recommend this film. For those who want a slasher and guts, they're going to be disappointed and possibly confused. But those who like horror to be a little intellectual and leave you thinking, this is one for your shelves. I think the fact this film has sat quietly in the background for so many years is a shame and really ought to be changed -- can we revive the elements this film has mastered?Unfortunately, the film was ""lost"" for a while and then found, but it is unclear how good the elements werethat havebeen found. The ""final cut"" blu-ray, for example, still looks faded and washed out in many scenes, and I find it hard to believe this was intentional. If a better negative could be found, we might get a better-looking film. But that is more of a nitpick, because even on VHS it still had an impact, video quality or not.",The Wicker Man
7,jboothmillard,The Wicker Man,9,23 September 2005,"It is was originally hated by the critics, but now it is considered a cult classic horror film, and favourite with students. I should also mention, the island and its Lord owner are real, hopefully what happens in the story there isn't. Basically police Sergeant, and Christian virgin Neil Howie (Edward Woodward) is sent to a Scottish island to investigate the reported disappearance of a teenage girl, Rowan Morrison. As he spends more time on the island, he finds the pagan peoples' behaviour, particularly sexual and blasphemous, utterly appalling, and he is not getting far with the search for Rowan. Even the owner of the island, Lord Summerisle (Christopher Lee in his favourite film role) is involved in this stuff, he even says in blasphemy ""God is dead""! When Neil sees the people getting ready for their pagan ritual, he disguises himself and eventually finds Rowan. But they were not after her, and the ritual is not about her sacrifice, but Neil's. The film's concluding scenes are the most powerful and chilling, where the man of God is placed into The Wicker Man where he is burned alive, almost crucifixion because he is pure, a virgin and a Christian. Also starring Diane Cilento as Miss Ros, Britt Ekland as Willow, Ingrid Pitt as Librarian and Irene Sunters as May Morrison. Sir Christopher Lee was number 31 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 13 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, the film was number 50 on The 100 Greatest Sexy Moments for Ekland's naked chanting (and the arse body double's gyrating), it was number 34 on The 100 Greatest Scary Moments, and number 19 on The 50 Greatest British Films. Very good!",The Wicker Man
8,Woodyanders,An outstanding and unsettling film,9,27 February 2019,"Uptight and puritanical devout Christian cop Sgt. Howie (superbly played to the rigid hilt by Edward Woodward) goes to a remote Scottish village to search for a missing girl. Howie encounters a peculiar, yet seemingly peaceful pagan cult led by the charismatic Lord Summerisle (Christopher Lee at his most personable and persuasive). However, said cult may not be nearly as benign as they outwardly appear to be.Director Robin Hardy relates the absorbing story at a steady pace, handles the strong and provocative subject matter about radically opposing religious principles and perspectives with care and intelligence, astutely pegs a happy and charming quality that slowly, but surely becomes more increasingly grim and upsetting as the narrative progresses towards a shocking downbeat conclusion, and tops everything off with a wickedly playful sense of merry perverse humor.Anthony Shaffer's sharp and literate script brilliantly subverts the old standard cornball notion about the enduring strength of faith: Howie's staunch adherence to his deeply felt Christian beliefs enables him to die instead of giving him the ability to survive and live to see another day. Another ingenious and inspired touch is that horrible and disturbing things happen in the bright daylight rather than at night like in more generic horror fare. Moreover, this film further benefits from fine acting by Diane Cilento as sweet school teacher Miss Rose, Britt Ekland as the enticing Willow, Ingrid Pitt as a foxy librarian, Lindsey Kemp as easygoing innkeeper Alder MacGregor, Aubrey Morris as a creepy gravedigger, and Ian Campbell as hulking brute Oak. Kudos are also in order for Harry Waxman's lovely cinematography and Paul Giovanni's jaunty score. Totally deserving of its sterling reputation.",The Wicker Man
9,ccthemovieman-1,Wasn't What Was Advertised (VHS review),5,12 September 2006,"Reading the back of the video box was very misleading to me. First, this was not a horror film, as advertised. Second, it8's not ""closed captioned"" as advertised. Third, it's not even scary. NOTE: This review was written years ago when I saw this on VHS. The DVD may have corrected some of this stuff.The 88-minute version I saw was all right, just a ""fair"" movie that didn't need to be scary to entertain. Apparently, there was a longer version made with 20 more minutes. The shorter was fine with me because how can you go with just one theme (a cop looking for a missing girl on an island.) Along the way, the cop is confronted by a group of pagan-worshipers, which is a little bizarre.There are some strange scenes in the movie and a somewhat memorable ending, but the film has a whole in way short of the rave reviews you read. Like me, you'll probably wind up disappointed after reading how great this was supposed to be.",The Wicker Man
10,rmax304823,What a powerful movie.,9,30 October 2005,"Pretty much everything comes together in this movie -- the direction, the score, the performances, the script, the photography, and the location shooting.I have no idea where the writer, Anthony Shaffer, got his ideas from, but it seems like he must have sat down and done a feverish week-long reading of Frazier's ""The Golden Bough."" He has just about everything in there and the rituals depicted, as far as I remember, are correct, though I am not sure they're all Gaelic. (The rutting in the cornfields, the ""rebirth"" through the stone cave towards the end.) Maybe in addition to Frazier we should throw in Mary Renault's ""The King Must Die"".I notice I'm skipping over a summary of the plot. This is because I'm sure it's adequately covered in other comments. Also, to be honest, it is not a very pleasant story to think about, unless you're the kind of person who gets a kick out of seeing a cat play with a doomed mouse. (Cf., John Fowles' novel, ""The Magus."") The story anyway isn't at all plausible. It's one of those tortured schemes in which the victim is trapped because everything he does has been predicted precisely by the trappers. His slightest move has been anticipated and planned for.Back to these more or less random comments. The score is by Paul Giovanni and will knock your socks off. (There's a lot of music in the film.) There is nothing in the way of an underscore. No incidental music to speak of, except a curious ""pwong"" sound at moments of particular drama, like the discovery of a March hare in a coffin or a sunset during a sacrifice.The first song we hear is shortly after Neil Howie, the police officer, enters the village, which, by John Barleycorn, I recognized immediately as Plockton, though I haven't been there for 30 years! Okay, so Howie walks into the local pub for the first time and is greeted by friendly and happy villagers of various ages. Howie is an uptight Presbyterian and, refusing a whiskey, asks to be taken to his room by Willow (Britt Ekland), the daughter of the pub's manager. The assembled musicians then begin to play a folksy tune and the patrons sing along. And it is at that particular point in the film -- maybe 10 minutes into it -- that we realize that something is seriously awry. The song is ""The Landlord's Daughter"" and the lyrics are a little beyond ""bawdy"" and only a little short of ""obscene"". Howie stares aghast as the some of the patrons begin to swing and dance to the rhythm. Willow bumps her rump against a couple of hairy men and laughing bends over while submitting to a kind of consensual frottage. This scene is shocking and really weird as hell -- trust me.Ekland shows Howie his room upstairs and while he lies in bed, he hears her close the door to the room next to his. Then the band downstairs commences a slowly bouncing beat until a fiddle begins to play. We expect the fiddle to bring in the tune -- but no. The fiddler repeats the same note but only in something like 16th notes. (I don't want to get in over my head here.) Upstairs a naked Willow thumps her palm softly in time with the rhythm on the wall between her and the sweating, virginal police officer. She begins to dance, writhing lewdly, and sings a strange song with erotic lyrics -- ""Come to me and say 'How do?'/ Things I will give to you/ A touch as light as feather."" I'm going to run out of space and I've hardly touched on the things that make this movie so remarkable. I can't very well NOT mention the excruciating climax of the film. (The last print I saw was lacking a few scenes, including one last entirely bleak one.) The thing has a hallucinatory quality. Odd things happen at odd times. Not only that, but they seem to tap into one's collective unconscious. It's as if all of the most primitive beliefs and rituals, the most staggering of human experiences, have come flooding out of some place you never knew existed in your brain. Half-coherent fairy tales, songs, and games, and dances from our individual childhoods and our joint pagan past parade around the edges of our perception. It is as spooky as all get out, and there is hardly any violence and not a drop of blood.Whew, what an experience.This is your comment, you may delete",The Wicker Man
11,Tweekums,A cult classic,8,5 September 2010,"Having recently watched the unnecessary remake I decided to go back and watch the original to see if it was as good as I had remembered. This is certainly a much better film although once you know how it ends future viewings do lose some of their impact.Edward Woodward plays Sergeant Howie of the West Highland Constabulary; he has received a letter reporting that a young girl, Rowan Morrison, has gone missing on the remote Summerisle. When he gets there everybody claims that there is no such girl on the island. Even the girls supposed mother claims not to recognise the girl in the picture he has. It soon becomes clear that life on the island is very different from that on the mainland; the population has given up Christianity and taken up older Pagan practices. Some are fairly innocuous like dancing around the maypole but when Howie sees a group of islanders dancing naked in a stone circle he becomes more disturbed. As the investigation continues he comes to believe that Rowan may have been murdered and later still he comes to the dreadful conclusion that she is still alive and that Lord Summerisle and the other islanders plan to sacrifice her to their gods on May Day. As the time of sacrifice approaches he searches desperately for her and eventually finds her. This isn't where the film ends however; just as he thinks he has rescued her he learns that she was never in danger but he most certainly is.This is a strange film as it is hard to pin it down to any one genre; it could be a murder mystery except for the fact that the 'victim' is alive, it could be horror but until the very end nothing horrible happens and that comes as a shock rather than as a building feeling of dread. There is just a constant feeling that something isn't quite right on the island. The acting from Edward Woodward and Christopher Lee was great, Woodward making us believe that Howie is as devout as he claims and Lee being delightfully sinister as Lord Summerisle. The rest of the cast put in good enough performances, the most memorable was Britt Ekland, although that was mainly for her naked dance. I can't believe that anybody reading won't know how this ends but won't spoil it just in case; suffice to say it is one of the most memorable of film endings.",The Wicker Man

The Scot police previously received an anonymous letter that implies the lost girl has been killed . There , the cop meets some rare denizens , (Diane Cilento , Britt Ekland , Lindsay Kemp , Aubrey Morris , among others) practice rare pagan rituals and pre-Celtics customs and all of them ruled by Lord Summerisle (Christopher Lee who agreed to appear for free) , the aristocrat ruler and religious leader of the strange society that cultivates apples and other agriculture products . Lord Summerisle , at the beginning seems to take it all as a joke , but he subsequently discovers his real intentions . Stranger still are the weird events that ulteriorly take place there . Then , Howie swears to find out the truth . This extraordinary and harrowing film from Robin Hardy -considered to be one of the finest horror ever made- contains suspense , mystery , occult terror with gratuitous eroticism and spectacular outdoors shot in Scotland . This is one of the most unusual British films and is set in a Scottish offshore island with a community practicing bizarre pagan sexual rites . Very persuasively and intelligent script written by playwright Anthony Shaffer , author of 'Sleuth' . The flick was inspired by an engraving called ""The Wicker Image"" in Britannia Antiqua Illustrata (1676) , some people have doubted the historical existence of the Wicker Man suggesting that it came from Roman propaganda by people such as Julius Caesar ; there is , however, undeniable evidence that the Druids and the Celts practiced human sacrifice . As ¨The Wicker Man¨ legend , however, is firmly tied in with Druidism . Nice acting by all cast , although the film is set in Scottish territory and all the characters are meant to be of Scottish nationality, all five of of the leading cast are not Scottish : Christopher Lee and Edward Woodward are English, Diane Cilento is Australian, Ingrid Pitt is Polish and Britt Ekland is Swedish . The movie was intended as a vehicle for Christopher Lee ; Lee himself has said that he considers this to be one of his greatest ever roles . The film displays a very good and colorful cinematography by Harry Waxman . The lyrics for the popular song 'Corn Rigs Are Bonnie' was actually written by Robert Burns in 1775 ; the music was written especially for the film musical score by Paul Giovanni . The final song, sung by the islanders around the sacrifice, is a thirteenth century 'reverdie' song celebrating the return of Spring . The motion picture was compellingly directed by Robin Hardy , being filmed in 1972 in Galloway in South West Scotland . Shown only in truncated copies for many years , for that reason to beware the lousy versions which may still be in circulation . This absorbing as well as exciting movie was followed by an inferior remake panned by critics and lukewarm by the world public . This new version by Neal LaBute with unsettling acting Nicolas Cage along with Molly Parker , Leelee Sobiesky , Diane Delano , being located in state of Washington . It differs on the original in various issues , as previous adaptation was in a Scotland island , the latter in State of Washington with a matriarchal society and without sexual situations , starred by a depressed patrolman (Nicolas Cage , character of Edward Woodward) affected by a car accident when receives a letter from ex-girlfriend (Kate Beaham) asking help for her disappeared daughter , he then goes to a strange matriarchal community , an Amish-alike, (ruled by Ellen Burstyn , Christopher Lee role) .

13,BA_Harrison,One of the best British horror films ever made.,10,4 September 2012,"Devout Christian copper Sgt. Howie (Edward Woodward) journeys to a remote island community, located off the western coast of Scotland, to investigate the reported disappearance of a twelve year old girl; on finding that the locals follow a pagan religion, and discovering that their precious fruit crops had failed the previous year, Howie begins to suspect that the missing child has been chosen as a human sacrifice to appease the gods and ensure a successful harvest..Unjustly ignored on its original release, The Wicker Man has since been acknowledged as a true classic of horror cinema, a status it most definitely deserves: rarely has a horror film achieved such an all-pervading aura of dread and culminated in a such a thoroughly gripping climax, leaving the viewer feeling so utterly emotionally drained as the end credits roll.Although there is very little in the film that would qualify as 'horror' in the traditional sense (no gore, no cheap scares, no supernatural occurrences), The Wicker Man is undoubtedly a frightening experience, its increasingly unsettling moments of weirdness, which include several oddball song and dance numbers, creating a palpable atmosphere of dread that really gets under the skin. Howie is clearly being led a merry dance, the bizarre pagan rituals and occult happenings witnessed during his stay, coupled with obvious subterfuge on the part of the islanders, all indicating that something terrible is afoot.Precisely what that is only becomes apparent in the film's final few minutes, but rest assured that it is a truly hideous revelation, one that will remain in the mind long after the sun has set on this marvellous piece of macabre cinema.",The Wicker Man
14,Coventry,Quite possibly the most unique film ever made!,10,7 May 2004,"Over a period of less than two days, I saw the Wicker Man three times. The original theatrical version once and the director's cut twice! Believe all the praising on this one. It really is one of the most stunning films that were ever unleashed upon the world. Unique is the most appropriate word that comes to mind in order to describe it. The Wicker Man is unlike any film you ever saw and an entire chapter of British cinema history to itself. Usually, it takes many parties to create a masterpiece but I dare to say The Wicker Man is largely Anthony Shaffer's accomplishment. His screenplay almost is too brilliant to put into words. The tiniest details and the slightest side-aspects are worked out perfectly. As a viewer, you'll literally feel like you're thereon Summerisle! No matter how illogical the plot may sound, the Wicker Man feels disturbingly real and alarming. Simply categorizing it as horror would do injustice to this versatile work of art. The fear and uncomfortable emotions it causes definitely are horror, but in the very first place this is a compelling mystery and a rough religious portrait. Actually, I don't want to give away too many plot aspects. The matter is far too fascinating to spoil and the solid story is so intelligent that a short summary wouldn't bring it any honor. Yes, I have that much respect for this film!! Just look at all the devout professionalism and be astonished as well! Another amazing aspect about The Wicker Man is the tempting soundtrackwith a slight bit of imagination; you could actually call it a musical. The music and the film make one terrific wholesome here, and that's a pretty rare achievement. Only in the ancient European exploitation, you can find a similar music-picture relationship. A good cast finishes it all. Edward Woodward shines in the leading role and Christopher Lee portrays the most memorable character in his entire remarkable career as Lord Summerisle. And then there's Britt Ekland as Willow! Unquestionably the most gorgeous lady in the British horror industry. Frankly, you haven't lived until you see (and hear) her sing her Siren's SongThis film deserves a spot in the IMDb top 250 more than any other motion picture ever did before. Rent, buy or  if necessary  steal this movie as soon as possible in case you haven't seen it yet. You can't afford yourself not having seen it.",The Wicker Man

What he finds is a culture steeped in Paganism, presided over by Lord Summerisle (Christopher Lee). Meeting static and indifference wherever he goes - and being driven to anger by the assault on his Christian beliefs - Howie is very much a man alone and most likely in grave danger? Directed by Robin Hardy and adapted to screen by Anthony Shaffer from David Pinner's novel, Ritual, The Wicker Man is very much a cult masterpiece. The back stories to it could make a film all by itself, be it censor baiting, studio cuts, body doubles or just plain offending religious groups, it's a film that is well worth looking into via the top range home format releases.From the moment Howie (a truly brilliant Woodward) lands at Summerisle everything seems off, there's a sinister atmosphere pervading the story. He is met by unnerving imagery wherever he goes, songs and rituals gnawing away at his senses, there's even eroticism deftly placed within the film's master plan. He doesn't know what's going on, and neither do we, this is a mystery right? There is after all a missing child to be found, right? But once Lord Summerisle (Lee also terrific) enters proceedings and ups his game, things unravel in edgy fashion, building up to the justifiably famous and harrowing finale.Some modern horror fans may baulk at the lack of bloody carnage et al, but this is classic horror. A horror film bulging with intelligence and pulsing away with literate smarts. 9/10",The Wicker Man
16,Theo Robertson,Hello Inspector . Send Me More Virgins To Burn,2,11 November 2003,"***** SPOILERS ******It`s not very often that I comment on what other people have written in their reviews but it`s not very often I see a movie as stupid as THE WICKER MAN get praised to the high heavens . Bryce David and Ray Girvan are totally correct in their views - This film revolves around the plot set-up of someone from a Scottish island sending an anonymous letter to a police station hoping that the policeman who reads it will investigate the case of a missing child - AND WHO WILL BE A VIRGIN ! What`s the chances of that ? and as said how would the islanders know in the first place ?  It also ignores other logical things like won`t Sgt Howie be missed if he`s sacraficed ? and is it fair to assume the police will investigate the contents of an anonymous letter ? It also seems to ignore police procedure . Wouldn`t CID lead the investigation for a missing child , and don`t policemen travel in pairs ? It`s rather a clever idea of a character being killed because they`re a virgin but not if it`s to the detriment of the rest of the story There`s other things that annoyed me . If this is a totally isolated Scottish island untouched by modern society then the inhabitants will be Celts , but are their pagan based ideals truly Celtic ? Doesn`t the English West country have may poles ? If so then surely people from the West country can`t have anything in common with these islanders who have a different cultural background ? The philosophy seen here is more new ageism than Celtic so is there any point of setting it on a remote Scottish island ? It`s also obvious that this has been happening for years . Does that mean they`ve been writing to police stations on the mainland for years and the cops have been sending them virgins ? I can`t escape from this ridiculous premise no matter how hard I try I don`t know if it`s the fault of the production or if channel 4 used a bad print but everything on screen seems very cheap and badly edited as the camera jumps around from scene to scene . The sound editing is very poor but listening to the songs I can`t say I`m complaining and I feel I should point out to anyone thinking of hiring Britt Ekland that if they`re using a stand in can they please use someone who has a vague passing resemblance to her , you know someone with blonde hair might be start . I know Christopher Lee said pre LORD OF THE RINGS that this is the best movie he ever appeared in , but can anyone name me a good film starring Lee where he doesn`t use the words "" Gandalf "" or "" Mordor "" ?THE WICKER MAN gets two out of ten",The Wicker Man
17,preppy-3,Exceptional but NOT a horror film,10,28 September 2004,"A police sergeant (Edward Woodward) goes to a remote island near Scotland hearing that a young girl is missing. When he gets there it seems no one has ever heard of her...and most say she never existed. He continues to search and the mystery gets deeper and deeper leading up to a very disturbing conclusion.I saw this during it's theatrical reissue in 1980--it was the cut 88 minute version. I was disappointed. It was advertised as a horror film and the edited version leaves gaping plot holes. I just saw the extended version on the DVD and loved it!For one thing, as I said, it is NOT a horror film. I went in expecting that and didn't get it. It's actually a thriller with strong religious and sexual overtures. There's WAY too much to get into about the religious views in this film, and the sexual element is STRONG! There's a whole circle of nude young women dancing around a fire, and an exceptional sequence in which a very erotic song is sung by a nude Britt Ekland. The mystery itself is fascinating but I really got caught up in the religious and social aspects presented in this film. Credit writer Anthony Shaffer for his script.Also the acting is great on all counts. Woodward deserves credit for playing such an unlikable character--and STILL getting you to sympathize with him! Also Hammer stars Christopher Lee and Ingrid Pitt (whose part is brutally reduced in the short version) are just great! For one thing it's interesting to see them playing fairly ""normal"" people (instead of vampires) and they give out excellent performances. Lee especially is enjoying himself--he did the film for free! To this day he said it's his best movie--he's right.An excellent, haunting thriller but it might be too much for some people. There's next to no blood or violence, but I do know some people who just found the ending a bit too much to handle. Still, it's a definite must-see.A deserved cult classic.",The Wicker Man

A Troubled Post Production, a delayed American Release, and some Severe, Significant Cuts that took some of the Edge off the Creepiness have also added to the Mystique of this Significant and Scandalous Occult Themed Movie.There is an Innocence to the Bawdy Pagan Sexuality that is Portrayed with an Uneasiness Designed to Disturb Christians and Prudes. it is a New-Age take on Age Old ""Religious"" Practice with Diabolical Distractions combined with a Straightforward Mystery conducted by a Straight-Laced Bible-Thumping Police Inspector.The Film is likely to Disturb, even Today, because of its Determined Tone of Bizarre Beliefs paraded in front of the Unbelieving Detective as the Townsfolk go about Their Creaky Customs with Gay Abandon and Unassuming Glee.The Climax is the most talked about portion of the Film but everything that leads there is as Different and Distinctive as anything You're likely to find in a Movie that is so Believable in its Exposition of Beliefs, both Traditional and Fringe, and as the whole Thing unfolds it will most likely be an Unforgettable B-Movie Experience.Beware Edited and Shortened Versions that are NOT Recommended.",The Wicker Man
19,poolandrews,"""A broad bean in it's natural state is not turquoise."" An excellent horror mystery thriller.",8,21 May 2007,"The Wicker Man is set on the privately owned island of Summerisle just of the coast of Scotland where Sergeant Neil Howie (Edward Woodward) of the West Highland Police has flown to by small sea plane to investigate a missing girl called Rowan Morrison (Geraldine Cowper) after receiving a mysterious letter from someone on Summerisle claiming she has been missing for several months. At first the locals seem very uncooperative & deny anyone named Rowan Morrison ever lived there, as Sergeant Howie carries out his investigation it quickly becomes apparent that the inhabitants of Summerisle are in fact Pagan worshippers who believe in human sacrifice & have lied to him. Howie fears Rowan might have been murdered but the truth, when revealed, is even more horrifying...This British production was directed by Robin Hardy & is a classic piece of horror with excellent storytelling. First off I'll say that there seems to be various versions of The Wicker Man floating around that range in length from under 90 minutes to over 100, from the original theatrical cut to the director's cut there are definitely a few different versions out there & I'm honestly not to sure which one I saw so bear that in mind. Anyway, the script by Anthony Shaffer first of hooks you with the mystery surrounding the missing girl & then presents a Pagan world where Christianity doesn't exist, it's a world where children dance naked around fires, where a mother tries to cure her daughter's sore throat by putting a toad in her mouth, where children are taught twisted ideas about sex, where there are no Church's or ministers & where the villagers openly have sex in public. It's all rather unnerving & pretty creepy as well, the character's are brilliantly developed, the dialogue is very effective but it's perhaps it's fantastic twist ending that The Wicker Man will be best remembered for as it's simply superb & has tremendous impact. The whole film has been thought through carefully & the sustained build up to it's climax works brilliantly, as a horror film, as a mystery, as a warning & it's original, it's considerably different from just about any other horror film I've ever seen anyway.Director Hardy does a great job here, who would have thought some pretty terrible sounding folk songs could be so creepy & unnerving? There's a great atmosphere to The Wicker Man although there aren't really any out and out scares, it has it's fair share of nudity but lacks any real gore or violence but when a film is this good & has such an excellent story that's as brilliantly told as The Wicker Man the lack of gore isn't a consideration.Technically the film is good, shot on location in Dumfries & Galloway in Scotland it makes for the perfect backdrop. The music plays a big part in The Wicker Man & it's very atmospheric & unsettling. The acting is strong from all involved, Woodward is very good, Christopher Lee states that this is maybe the best thing he's ever done while the Swedish Britt Ekland takes her clothes off.The Wicker Man is considered a cult classic & it's an accusation I have a hard time arguing with, however as always there are going to be people out there who 'don't get it' or simply don't like it & that's fine because we are all entitled to an opinion. Having said that I'm pleased to know there seems to many more out there who definitely like it rather than not, personally I think it's a great film & it's as simple & straight forward as that. Remade by Hollywood & starring Nicholas Cage as The Wicker Man (2006) & interestingly set for another remake or 'reimagining' as they like to describe it by director Robin Hardy as Cowboys for Christ (2007) again starring Christopher Lee.",The Wicker Man

The best part was when he was mesmerized by Willow's (Britt Ekland) sensuous dance in the adjoining room. He couldn't deal with the copious nudity and symbols of sex all around him.Christopher Lee was also extremely good as Lord Summerisle and lay a brilliant trap that we are all familiar with.Ingrid Pitt also gave great delight when Sergeant Howie was searching the village.The music was captivating and the whole scene was perfect for the story.",The Wicker Man

Genuinely unsettling, and disturbing, occult thriller with pious Scotland police Sgt. Howie (Woodward in one of his iconic roles and arguably his finest on-screen work), sets a course into terror when he is called into investigate the disappearance of a young girl of a mysterious off-coast isle inhabited by some very odd ducks to say the least, including their genially nefarious 'leader' Lord Summerisle (Lee, ditto, who reportedly stated this was his favorite film and role; incidentally Lee's ol' Hammer Films chum Peter Cushing was slated to star as his nemesis Howie, but had to bow out due to other film commitments; would've been a real hoot!). Crisply written by acclaimed author/playwright/screenwriter Anthony Burgess with an O.Henry twist thanks to tight, precisely timed direction by Robin Hardy and excellent production design and the Celtic inspired original music by Paul Giovanni gets under the skin with a scalpel-sharp viscerality. The film's final moments are masterfully unforgettable and decidedly stomach- knotting, nerve-endingily eerie.

22,view_and_review,"No, 1973 Wasn't Any Better Than 2006",2,22 September 2018,"I thought the 2006 ""The Wicker Man"" was bad. Honestly, being that the '06 version was a remake I figured it screwed up the original like so many remakes do. Well, it didn't have much to work with from the start. This movie was awful.I could easily say it was awful because it was clumsily pitting Christianity against paganism but that wasn't even it. They could've done that in a more palatable manner and the movie still would've been awful. For the first quarter of the movie I thought it was a musical, which was highly perturbing because 1.) I don't like musicals and 2.) the singing was TERRIBLE. Even when they went away from the musical format the singing and soundtrack interspersed throughout the rest of the movie was atrocious.I already knew the ending from watching Nicholas Cage scream, ""No, not the bees!!"" so in a way that detracted from the movie. I was still looking for something promising and noteworthy to cling to to tell me that the 1973 version was actually good. Nope. Never found it.They dragged the final sequence on interminably. No suspense. No drama. Just dragging to make the quota for feature length film I suppose. And of course the final sequence was exponentially longer being that I knew the conclusion. I'll tell you my conclusion: this was trash.",The Wicker Man
23,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Enjoyable if slightly flawed effort,8,19 October 2017,"Traveling to a secretive island, a mainland police detective investigating a child abduction case finds the locals practice a pagan-like religion that hinders his quest as the more he reveals about it the gradual realization of his appearance there is revealed and must stop it from happening.This here was quite the fun if a really flawed effort. One of the few problems here is the fact that there are some really bland and unappealing folk songs throughout here that just make this one feel overlong and quite bland. The numerous musical interludes really overwhelm this one as they're not that good and really don't offer up much of anything for the film other than getting in some nice innuendo, but on the whole it's not that appealing to stop the film cold to feature yet another suggestive local song-and-dance that's already mentioned before or to have an utterly obnoxious folklore tune continually play out. There's also a rather big problem here with the central mystery that unfolds here, simply providing a series of behavior that he finds weird only due to the contrast against the Christian ideologies he keeps spouting off yet none of these events really have much of a horror or even suspense setup as their standoff-ish behavior and mysterious rituals don't have any building suspense. The whole first hour plays out like a sardonic fish-out-of-water tale rather than any kind of macabre overview of a horror film as it boils down to a continuous series of run-ins with free-spirited folks who stonewall his investigations and scoff as his views of their practices which really hinders the film somewhat. There's still a lot to like here despite these issues, as there's a wicked air under the surface here as the weirdness of their transgressions slowly reveals far more menacing tones. The way it shows their attention to the pagan religion spurning his efforts with their brazen worship of paganism iconography and symbolism, the lax attitude to sexuality that shows copious couplings in public spaces, nude worshipping practices and the induction of children into sexually explicit conversations which are then thrown back at him with a rather easy-going dismissal that works a rather involving mystery here as they overlay these with the slowly unfolding mystery about the girl. This is certainly aiding nicely with the events of the finale which is undoubtedly the highlight here with the absolutely crazy ritual procession through the town as the garish costumes and jovial dancing creates some fully impressive sequence which comes off nicely alongside the central twist here that makes for a truly harrowing and cruel twist that really works well here. That gives this a considerable amount of good parts over the flaws, and along with the fine nudity throughout gives this a lot to really enjoy about this one.Rated R: Full Nudity, Violence, Language, some sexual conduct and intense themes of children-in-jeopardy.",The Wicker Man
24,AaronCapenBanner,Brilliant Drama/Horror.,10,19 September 2013,"Edward Woodward delivers another powerful performance in director Robin Hardy's brilliant, unforgettable drama/horror film as police Sergeant Howie is sent to an isolated Scottish island to investigate reports of a missing girl. He is shocked to find that, not only do the locals deny the girl's existence, but that they belong to a pagan cult led by Lord Summerisle(Christopher Lee, one of his best performances)The people have rejected Howie's deeply-held Christian Faith, which disgusts him. He then becomes convinced that the locals plan to sacrifice the virginal girl to their gods in order to have a better crop next season(they export apples), but unfortunately for Sergeant Howie, its not the girl he should have been worried about...Powerful and thought-provoking film is supremely well written and acted, giving us a scenario of how one person's faith can be used against them, and how everything you find a strength, someone else can see as weakness. Unforgettable ending will leave you stunned & speechless; no moral triumphs here, though the good Sergeant's faith was sustained, which was to his credit; it's a tragedy that the poor man was outnumbered...",The Wicker Man

It turned out to be a pretty decent movie, but I wouldn't call it a horror flick.  Great cast and acting make this mystery go which it is more of a mystery type flick.  Of course at one point I was worried it was going to be some sort of musical, but after a stint where there are quite a few songs in a row they taper off.  Of course the one song with Britt Ekland was rather good...heh heh.  Christopher Lee is great in this one as well.  It basically follows a cop from england trying to find a missing girl on an island full of pagans.  In the end I really felt sorry for the one character.",The Wicker Man
26,Wuchakk,An Original Film that Successfully Mixes Genres,6,11 March 2014,"The story involves a police officer (Edward Woodward) flying to a Scottish isle to find a missing girl. As a devout Christian he is horrified to learn that the islanders have long ago rejected Christianity in favor of paganism. He starts to suspect that the entire populace is involved with the girl's disappearance.Many people peg ""The Wicker Man"" as a horror film, but this is not correct. Yes, it ends as a horror story but the first 85% of the film is a mix of other film genres -- mystery/detective, musical and erotica.The cast features Christopher Lee as the head pagan Lord Summerisle. Britt Ekland and Ingrid Pitt are also on hand.WHAT WORKS: The picture was filmed on location in Scotland and features some truly breath-taking photography. It'll definitely make you want to visit this magnificent region of the earth.Britt Ekland plays ""Willow,"" the hotel-keeper's daughter, and she has an excellent scene trying to lure Woodward out of his room for some late-night amorous activity. Her siren-song ""How Do"" is a soothing and moving piece of music. Sometimes I just put on this scene to enjoy (I'm talking musically, of course, but Ekland is pleasing to look at as well). The film is worth getting just for this song.The May-pole song is also a catchy folk ditty.***SPOILER ALERT*** The ending is also a bit unexpected. I kept waiting for Woodward to escape his terrible predicament, but it never happened -- they literally fried his a$$! ***END SPOILER*** WHAT DOESN'T WORK: As the mystery progresses and Woodward does his detective work the story fails to capture your undivided attention. In other words, the story has a decidedly lazy vibe to it; your mind may wander at times. Needless to say, if you have a problem with ACDC -- I'm sorry, I mean ADHD -- you probably won't like this picture.THINGS TO KEEP IN MIND: This is an early 70s British film and so naturally has that Hammer film vibe, even though it's not a Hammer film. The folk songs and soundtrack naturally reflect this era. So, if you don't like Hammer films or early 70s folk/hippie music you probably won't appreciate ""The Wicker Man."" Also, there is a lot of nudity, even in the short version, so if nudity offends you skip this one.FINAL ANALYSIS: This is a very original film that successfully mixes various film genres. As far as originality goes ""The Wicker Man"" is 5-Stars film all the way. It's worthy of its 'cult film' status. It's dated, however, and therefore screams out for a remake. Hence, although nothing can ever take the place of the original, I'm personally looking forward to the remake.FINAL THOUGHT: Did the mainland police officer REALLY lose in this story? Philippians 1:21 states, ""to live is Christ and to die is gain.""GRADE: B-",The Wicker Man
27,zetes,"Half stupid, half good; mmm...perhaps 2/3 stupid",9,20 September 2002,"Great ideas to be found in The Wicker Man, but, man, is it poorly executed! It's barely competent in its direction, editing, and writing. Of course, the version I watched is apparently much shorter than the latest director's cut. Still, I can't imagine it being any longer - Christ, how could it be any longer? 90% of the film's faults can be found in the main character, Sergeant Howie (Edward Woodward). He is a police officer who goes to remote Summerisle to investigate a reported missing child case. The island is populated by pagan worshipers, and he is a Christian. While the inhabitants dance around the isle naked, he prays, sweats, and assumes that they are going to or have already sacrificed the missing child to their heathen gods. Howie is a terrible character, very poorly performed by Woodward. He's constantly shifting and changing, going through ridiculous jumps in logic. To boot, he's entirely unsympathetic - one of the cinema's greatest douche bags. Basically, I was sitting there just wishing someone would sacrifice his ass. All the other performances are rather pretty amateurish, as well. Christopher Lee's is the only one really approaching competence, although there were some stretches when I couldn't exactly understand what he was saying. I guess Britt Ekland was okay, who plays the innkeeper's daughter, but I was probably just hypnotized by her gyrating bare bum. The writing is often laughable. Even though I watched a shortened version of the film, there were still too many scenes that were obviously and unarguably redundant. I'm specifically thinking of a scene in which Sergeant Howie goes to the library and reads a book that gives him the final clues he needs to realize where the missing girl is - except that he already figured it all out the night before in his hotel room. The screenwriter really should have been paying more attention - or any attention at all. There are a couple of big reasons that do make the film marginally decent. I mean, even while I did feel it was a pretty silly film, and I could go on criticizing it for pages, I did actually find a lot to like. In particular, the music is great. It can be thought of as a musical, as there are several musical sequences - and very good ones - in the film. And it does have an amazing, memorable final sequence. All in all, it's worth a watch. I just don't think it's worth going nuts over, as many seem to have. 6/10.",The Wicker Man

29,christopher-underwood,"something that resonates, something that draws me to take another look, every now and again",8,16 January 2020,"I first saw this film upon its initial theatrical screening playing 'B' feature to Don't Look Now. I walked in halfway through, as happened in the days of continuous performances, with a group of work pals, there to see the main feature. Whilst intrigued by what I saw, especially the extraordinary ending, I have never been an avid fan of the film, despite several subsequent viewings. I was particularly unimpressed with the awkward and somewhat stilted performance of Edward Woodward and not much more a fan of Christopher Lee who seems to try far too hard and yet remains inconsistent in his role. With the incredible final sequences etched in my mind I have, over the years, sought out other such stylish and accomplished scenes, in vain. The naked ladies and the fire at the stones is well shot and Britt Eckland's dance is impressive even if we are now made aware that it took 13 hours and the inclusion of another party. Some editing achievement there then. No, this is not an easy film to like with its amateurism and embarrassing sequences, and yet. Undeniably there is something here, something that resonates, something that draws me to take another look, every now and again and, of course, the reason some have always found it so impressive. It is hard to put a finger on it but perhaps it is because it does not have too many notable scenes, lacks an overall sense of style and seems rather awkward that it seems all the more to speak to us in less obvious ways and perhaps, thereby to tap into something of us we are less able to express but feel nevertheless.",The Wicker Man
30,siderite,Children of the Corn meets Hellstrom's Hive in a remarkable thriller,8,5 November 2006,"The movie, as 70ish as they come, shows a policeman coming to a remote island to investigate what seems to be a missing child case. As the story unravels, we are thrown into a pagan world with weird beliefs and rituals. The plot is good, the acting great, the soundtrack is appropriate and the erotic dancing of Swedish beauty Britt Ekland is something I would have never expected from a movie from that time. Or maybe we are getting more Victorian than they ever were in the 70s.Anyway, this is an intense thriller, dealing mostly with feelings of social weirdness. In fact it is so intense that I felt the need to make a pause after an hour or so. And it is a psychological thriller, no gore, no murders or monsters or anything like that. I especially liked the fact that the pagan religion of the island wasn't actually portrayed as silly and evil. Quite the opposite. The religiously active policeman didn't go out into hysterical fits either, and we see on the actor how the character is split between his deep Christian beliefs and his job as a a police officer.To conclude, if you liked Children of the Corn you will absolutely love this one. It's deeper, with more script to it and a lot more acting. I wonder how the 2006 remake will be, I hope they didn't trim it down in order to appeal to both dumb and pious people that bring their children along.",The Wicker Man
31,ShadeGrenade,Island Of Mystery,10,18 November 2009,"Every now and then a film comes along which becomes a classic in spite of it not receiving much publicity, or in some cases box-office, at the time of release. Such a film was 1973's 'The Wicker Man', scripted by Anthony Shaffer ( author of 'Sleuth' ) and directed by Robin Hardy. The legend goes that when British Lion boss Michael Deeley saw an early version he hated it so much he cut it to ribbons and to this day no-one knows where the missing footage went. But its popularity grew through word of mouth.I first saw it in 1988 when it was shown on B.B.C.-2 as part of 'Moviedrome', a series devoted to cult films hosted by Alex Cox. From the opening ( a poor quality clip of Sgt.Neil Howie praying in church ) I was hooked. Howie flies to the remote Scottish island of Summerisle, to investigate a complaint concerning the apparent disappearance of a little girl named Rowan Morrison. Right from the word go, he senses something is up. The locals stare at him as though he has stepped off a spaceship. He finds that Christianity is only taught in the local school as a comparative religion, and that the inhabitants are Pagan. Children dance naked round fires, couples fornicate in public places, penis-shaped trees are all over the place, the locals sing ribald songs about Willow McGregor ( Britt Ekland ), the buxom daughter of the landlord of the inn where Howie is staying.When Howie confronts Lord Summerisle ( Christopher Lee ), he expresses astonishment at finding a place so steeped in Paganism he can barely believe it exists in the 20th century. He continues his investigations, but the locals prove obstinate. Finally, he discovers what happened to young Rowan, and the answer has horrifying repercussions for him personally...That is all I want to tell you of the plot. Watch the film for yourself. Edward Woodward, who sadly died two days ago, is simply brilliant as 'Sgt.Howie', a God-fearing policeman determined to carry out his duties despite being led down wrong paths. In a particularly memorable scene, he is in bed while a naked Willow pounds on the wall next door, tempting him. Many men would not be able to resist her ( me included! ), but his faith keeps him pure. Also good is Christopher Lee as 'Lord Summerisle', a role far removed from 'Count Dracula'. He is charming and sinister. Diane Cilento and Ingrid Pitt give Ekland competition in the looks department.Fans of 'Rab C.Nesbitt' should keep an eye peeled for a young Barbara 'Ella' Rafferty and Tony 'Jamesie Cotter' Roper in small roles.The whole film is superbly written and shot, getting its 'scares' from atmosphere and mood, rather than blood and gore. Another of its strengths is Paul Giovanni's folk music. The final scene apparently terrified Woodward when he filmed it, and it is not hard to see why. It makes an incredibly powerful climax to this motion picture.'The Wicker Man' has often been described as a pro-Pagan film. I do not agree. It is apparent that the inhabitants of Summerisle are wasting their time by worshipping their gods, just as Sgt.Howie's faith in his ultimately serves him no good. It is anti-religious if anything. I do not really regard it as a horror film either ( only one person dies in the whole movie ). It is more of a mystery.Forget the pointless Nicolas Cage remake and watch this instead. It gets better with each viewing, whereas one viewing of the Cage version was more than enough.",The Wicker Man
32,JamesHitchcock,The Sleep of Reason,6,20 January 2005,"Although ""The Wicker Man"" is sometimes classified as a horror film, it starts off like a standard police detective drama. Neil Howie, a sergeant with the West Highland Constabulary, arrives on Summerisle, a small Hebridean island, to investigate the case of a young girl named Rowan Morrison who has been reported as missing. To his surprise, however, the local people prove to be unhelpful to him in his search, either evading his questions or deliberately misleading him. An even greater surprise to Howie is the discovery he makes about the religious beliefs of the locals. They have abandoned Christianity and, encouraged by Lord Summerisle, the local laird, adopted a form of paganism. Howie starts to suspect that Rowan may have been murdered as a sacrifice to the island's pagan gods.The film raises some interesting philosophical issues about the nature of religious belief. Howie is a devout Christian, and is shocked by the paganism of the islanders. He is shocked partly by their open attitude to sex which conflicts with his own puritanical views, but mostly by their callousness about human life. Although the film was made in the hippy era of the early seventies, with its growing interest in alternative forms of religion, it is not a celebration of paganism. The faith of the islanders is not a benign nature-worship but rather a cruel, superstitious, mechanistic fertility cult, devoid of any genuine spirituality.The view one takes of the religious issues raised by the film will probably depend upon one's own religious views and also upon how one sees the ambiguous character of Howie. On the one hand he comes across as deeply unsympathetic- narrow-minded, dogmatic and priggish. On the other, he is the only representative we see not only of law and order but also of decency and morality. He may be a prig, but he is also the only character in the film who objects to human sacrifice on moral grounds. It seems to me that two quite different interpretations of the film are possible. On the one hand, it could be seen as a humanist critique of religion. On this reading, Howie's Christianity could be seen as merely a watered-down variety of the islanders' fierce paganism, more socially respectable but no more rational. When Howie challenges him about his beliefs, Lord Summerisle retorts with some sharp comments about the Christian doctrine of the Virgin Birth.On the other hand, it would be possible to see this as a Christian film, an exemplification of Chesterton's dictum that when men cease to believe in God, they will not believe in nothing, they will believe in anything. Summerisle and his followers do not merely reject Christianity, they also reject the entire rationalist tradition of the Enlightenment. They believe that human sacrifice will ensure the success of their harvests and that illnesses can be cured by placing a toad in the sufferer's mouth. Howie stands not only for orthodox theology but also for orthodox science. Religion and science are sometimes portrayed as being in conflict, but it can also be argued that science has had a beneficent effect upon religion; by removing material affairs such as the cure of the sick and the fertility of the soil from the hands of priests and shamans and entrusting them to doctors and agronomists, it has freed contemporary Christianity from these concerns and enabled it to concentrate more on spiritual matters.I normally like films that tackle weighty themes and ask difficult questions without necessarily providing easy answers, so I am disappointed that I did not like ""The Wicker Man"" more. It seems unfortunate that so many versions exist; I have seen two on British television, both different from one another and neither the full director's cut. I will therefore reserve my comments on the direction until I have seen the definitive version, but neither of the versions I have seen flowed easily. The famous ending is genuinely shocking (as Goya said, the sleep of reason produces monsters), but what leads up to it does not always tell the story with any fluency.The acting was too often wooden and lifeless. In the case of Edward Woodward as Howie this was presumably deliberate, as his character is supposed to be a stiff, formal individual who finds it difficult to show emotion, but none of the other characters seemed any more animated. Christopher Lee as Summerisle had too much of the urbane British gentleman about him and not enough of the religious fanatic. The worst contribution came from Britt Ekland, who wandered through the film as though she did not know what she was doing in it. Come to that, I wasn't sure what she was doing, either. A body double was used for her dance scene, her singing voice was dubbed and (according to some accounts) her speaking voice was too, apparently because she could not manage a convincing Scottish accent. She was presumably only hired because the film-makers thought that to have a glamorous international star in the cast-list would be good for the takings at the box-office.Despite these weaknesses, the film is often thought-provoking, and there is enough of interest to make it worth watching. 6/10",The Wicker Man
33,lasttimeisaw,a cunningly composed tale of religion foolery to an appalling effect,7,6 November 2016,"British film director Robin Hardy, who passed away this year at the age of 86, only made three movies during his lifetime, and his debut feature THE WICKER MAN, now has undergone a long way to become a religious horror cult after its initial cold shoulder from critics and audience upon its release in its home turf. In the brief preface before the opening credits, Sergeant Howie (Woodward) is seen as a devout Christian, which underpins his martyr-status like Jesus in the Eucharist. Shortly after, the film relocates entirely on an Scottish island, Summerisle, where Howie comes to tackle with the case of a missing young girl, only gets increasingly miffed and discombobulated through the investigation where Celtic paganism is blatantly worshipped by its villagers, what's more horrific is that his advent is completely premeditated with a hidden agenda, and there is absolutely no way for him to leave this insular place.Far from being a conventional jump-scare horror fare, a salient feature of THE WICKER MAN is its mysterious set-up towards the final money-shot, which is constituted of a magnanimous supply of ethereal folk songs, often in diegetic forms, imbues a distinctly ritualistic otherworldliness, where symptoms of degeneration and heresy suffuse the film: the flagrant lies, the open-air lovemaking (with women uniformly stay on top), the eroticized close-up of a snail as an emblem of carnal consummation, the unorthodox teaching school children about phallic worship, a frog-swallowing medical treatment, a wriggling nude dance of telepathic seduction, the May Day celebration with animal costumes, masquerades and escapades. To a modern viewer who takes a more clement slant on religious persuasion, these sequences are mind-opening, palatably surreal, anything but threatening if they are not benighted enough to believe in human sacrifice. However, that is the road where this lucid story heads, the collision course between Christianity and paganism is inexorable, Hardy and screenwriter Anthony Shaffer pull no punches to leave its audience downright astonished, refuse to tamper the ending with a deus ex machina. So that is all she writes, a cunningly composed tale of religion foolery to an appalling effect. Certainly Sgt. Howie doesn't deserve this denouement, but surprisingly, there is less pathos out of it, since Woodward's stern and self-righteous performance doesn't make him a sympathetic hero, he is obstinately blunt and incredulously naive, could he have been more tactful and less religion- frenetic, at least, he would have find some ally among the folks, perhaps someone who hasn't been completely brainwashed by Lord Summerisle (Lee), thus it would turn out to be another story less confrontational. Overall, the cast is adequately one-dimensional, save the almighty Christopher Lee, who is visibly relishing in his suave and eloquent mastermind persona, a true form of evil but a charismatic villain who can compellingly entrance his adherents.With the iconic ""wicker man"" image immutably leaving an indelible fingerprint on audience's mind, Robin Hardy's one-hit-wonder promisingly retains its inimitable appeal by coalescing the horror genre with such inherently incongruous epithets as gaily, lilting and a hero's undoing.",The Wicker Man
34,Red-Barracuda,A truly masterful and beautiful film,10,1 February 2012,"This oddity of a movie went by almost unnoticed on its initial cinema release, playing support as part of a double bill that also included Nicolas Roeg's Don't Look Now (another sublime work but that's another story). The very fact that The Wicker Man was met with such indifference seems somewhat absurd now. Over the years its reputation has grown and grown to the point that its often described as the greatest horror film to come out of Britain. I can't say I disagree with this view either. It remains a commendably intelligent and original genre picture and there really isn't anything else out there much like it.Its story about a policeman who travels to a remote Scottish island to investigate the disappearance of a young girl is not worth going into here. If you know the story it will serve no purpose, and if you have never seen the film before it will only spoil the experience. The mystery element is a significant strong point. The investigation of the disappearance of Rowan Morrison is never less than compelling. But what elevates this movie further is a combination of this strong narrative with an intelligent script and the bizarre details that are used to depict the unusual way of life of these pagan islanders. This latter aspect is serviced by the general oddness of the inhabitants, their pagan rituals and of course their music. The film is replete with folk songs. They simultaneously lend the story an authenticity and surrealism. The soundtrack incorporates a variety of moods from haunting lilting drones to the strangely upbeat. Best of all, of course is 'Willow's Song'. This is the haunting ballad sung by the femme fatale Willow in the dead of night through a wall to the protagonist Sergeant Howie in the next room. It's a song of enticement, where the siren tests the chaste policeman with one final trial of temptation. Even the repressed Christian policeman struggles to fight the sexual desire engendered by Willow and her song. To be honest the 'Willow's Song' sequence is worth the price of admission alone. The song itself is quite spine-tinglingly and hauntingly beautiful and this combined with the loveliness of the semi-naked Britt Ekland's provocative performance makes it one of the most perfectly conceived sequences of erotica in cinema.There is a great cast here too. Edward Woodward is terrific as Sergeant Howie, while Christopher Lee exudes cool authority as lord Summerisle. But even characters in small parts have real personality here, while there is a trio of fantastic actresses to add further class, namely, the aforementioned Britt Ekland, Diane Cilento and Ingrid Pitt - what more do you want? Then you have very odd performances from the likes of Lindsay Kemp as the highly camp landlord Alder MacGregor and Aubrey Morris as the strange gravedigger. Its overall a brilliant cast, well used. In addition to this the various locations and the landscape are used to great effect. The setting adds a great deal to the impact and helps generate the unique mood that The Wicker Man has. While the inclusion of various elements of pagan worship and belief is done in a considered way and always seems believable.There are two versions of this film available. And it does have to be said that the directors cut is the one to watch. Not only does it include extra scenes on the mainland and one where a young boy becomes a man via a ritual involving Willow but it also reorders the position of 'Willow's Song' within the story. In the director's cut this scene comes near the end of the film, just before the May Day finale. This means that it has extra significance. It makes it clear that it is the final test put to Sergeant Howie. In the original it comes too early and doesn't have the same impact.The Wicker Man remains a highly original work. Its story has a real purpose too. By the end of it you see everything fall into place and it becomes obvious that there is some real intelligence behind this. Its a glorious one of a kind movie.",The Wicker Man

38,bensonmum2,"""It's much too dangerous to jump through fire with their clothes on.""",10,8 May 2006,"I'll try to keep this short as I've always found it difficult to write about a movie I genuinely love. Give me a bad movie and I'll write for days, but with a brilliant film like The Wicker Man, I'm at a loss for words. If it's possible, I enjoy The Wicker Man more and more with each successive viewing. I notice things each time I see the movie that I never noticed before. It may be something as insignificant as a small piece of set decoration or a look that one character gives another, but they all add to the overall enjoyment I get out of this movie. And regardless of the number of times I've seen The Wicker Man, that final scene has lost none of its power. The images of Sergeant Howie being led off to face his destiny are some of the best I've seen in any movie. It's the kind of moment that you don't easily forget. As I said, it's powerful stuff.I just checked to see who won the Academy Award for Best Actor for 1971. Don't misunderstand because Gene Hackman is good in The French Connection, but there are very few performances that I feel compare with Edward Woodward in The Wicker Man. People in movies like The Wicker Man don't generally get recognized for awards, but they should. It's a fantastic performance. Every moment, whether it's what I call The Seduction of Sgt. Howie to The Indignation of Sgt. Howie to The Martyrdom of Sgt. Howie, Woodward expresses more emotion and conveys more feeling than most actors are capable of. Whether you like the character or not, it would be difficult to deny how effective Woodward is.",The Wicker Man
39,lost-in-limbo,A conflict of faith.,10,19 May 2006,"Police Sergeant Howie travels to an isolated Scottish island after receiving a letter explaining the disappearance of a young girl who has been missing for a couple of months. When he arrives on the island, the folks seem to have no idea about who the girl is, but through his investigation he realises that they are keeping him in the dark about it. While, at the same time his Christian beliefs are tested as the community led by Lord Summerisle openly perform their Pagan ways, despite that of Howie's personal disgust.It's been quite awhile since I've last watched this flick, but none of that impending doom and confronting material I felt on my first viewing has escape this timeless masterpiece. The way the old-fashioned tale is able to captivate with it's vividly, intelligent labyrinth of believable developments and symbolisms makes it hard not to get emotionally attached. Well, that was the case for me. ""The Wicker Man"" was a different type of horror (which has never been matched in its context) compared to the most practical Hammer vehicles that were coming out of England at the time and actor Christopher Lee knew it. The version I got around to watching was the extended director's cut and I didn't really know that it had a bumpy, that's a REAL bumpy production history. The interviews on the DVD on the matter is pretty interesting and very informative. It was nice to see it in its full cut, as think I caught the original theatrical release when it was played on TV.This fascinating film is something you won't see quite often with it's very expressive and soothing folk musical elements that burns itself a mark in the haunting atmosphere. While, the seductiveness of these sensual activities and rituals of the old religion gives the film an powerful embrace where you're just so compelled to the presentation. While, it might look rather relaxing and carefree in appearance, there was just something unsettling underneath it all waiting to break out. And the sting in the film's tale proves that. The film is probably best known for it's shocking conclusion and I still get goose bumps and a lump in my throat when watching it.The credible story by Anthony Shaffer stirs the emotions by balancing out some complex and poetic details, but it's so well rounded on many levels that the intensity thickens with the continuous debate between the two religions - Christianity and Paganism. Also there's some moral ground being thrown about and script too is rather diverse. But let's not forget the central focus is that of the missing girl that adds to the mystery side of the story. This segment of the story is incredibly gripping and has a realistically nightmarish touch in the way it pans out. The film's art direction is beautifully captured with it's mesmerizing glow and the picturesque location provided some breath-taking scenery.The performances are nothing but short of fabulous with a strong show by the entire cast. Their characters were rather fruitful and they took advantage of that. Edward Woodward is downright brilliant as the hard-nosed Police Sergeant Howie who represents Christianity and the law. He simply evokes such a strict passion in his delivery! Christopher Lee is at the top of his game as the mysterious Lord Summerisle. Gladly none of them chew up the scenery. The rest of the supporting roles were great too. Britt Ekland is extremely divine as the very tempting Willow, Diane Cilento is equally so as the schoolteacher Miss Rose. Also making a very small appearance is Ingrid Pitt.Vintage work all round makes this one an effectively clever and graceful, but also quite unsettling film.Side-note: But even with all of this praise that I have given to it, I see that mostly people tend love it or hate it.",The Wicker Man
40,Robert_duder,WAY over rated...let's talk comparisons...,6,17 September 2006,"This is far more than just a review. I need to compare because prior to the newest remake of The Wicker Man I had never heard of this film. After seeing the very decent and harshly panned remake starring Nicholas Cage I knew I HAD to see this ""glorious"", ""terrific"", ""classic"" original that everyone was raving about. Now I won't pretend the film wasn't good, the original Anthony Shaffer's The Wicker Man is a decent and disturbing occult drama. I can't say thriller because there isn't near the thrill that the remake had to it. This original was more of a dramatic, and disturbing look at a very disturbed little island. This is where the remake absolutely trounced the original because Neil LaBute's Wicker Man had so much more depth and background information and left no major plot holes like the original does. Why does Sergeant Howie (the exact person they needed for the sacrifice) come to the island?? Who sent the letter?? Why was he sent alone?? All these questions are dealt with in the remake with more a secure story and background. Still Anthony Shaffer's The Wicker Man takes the cake on twisted. The people on this island are not just cult freaks and cut off from the mainland...they are utterly and completely insane. This is proved with the very strange sudden burst into song making it into a semi-musical complete with naked dancing and slapping their rear ends while they dance. The film has a very dark and disturbing undertone for certain but it's claim to fame is questionable?? Edward Woodward plays Sergeant Howie, and absolutely impresses!! Woodward is terrific as the morally secure, determined police officer. I would say that he does a significant better job at the part than his predecessor Nicholas Cage. Much like the remake Woodward truly is the star and everyone else is a supporting cast, some more than others. The beautiful Britt Ekland is thrown in there as a seductive temptress and does a decent job in that role. Irene Sunters plays the mother of the missing girl and her role hardly takes her from her kitchen but she still manages to come across as disturbed and creepy so kudos to her. And legendary actor Christopher Lee makes an appearance in the latter half of the film as the mysterious leader Lord Summerisle. Lee has a small part but he definitely adds to the cast and does a terrific job as Summerisle. The debate between Lee and Woodward over their ""pagan"" rituals is quite interesting.The film is not mind blowing although it is ripe with culture of the British which is great for them. I can see it being a highlight of their movie making history because it's intriguing and haunting. The Irish or English ballads that are used throughout the film absolutely chill you to the bone and are reminiscent of Simon and Garfunkle. Director Robin Hardy who never really went anywhere after this film does a really great job capturing the beauty of this island and the people and their foreign ways. But the film doesn't give you enough answers to all the peculiar questions. The story feels half fulfilled and the ending instead of being a thrill turns out to be disappointing because the questions are just not answered. For that reason the original falls short of being as good as or better than the recent remake. I know that's not a popular opinion and I might get booed for it but the remake had so much more of a story and besides the fact that the depth of the story was added there was so much that they kept faithful to the original film which is why I don't understand the outcry of hatred towards the remake. They were almost identical!! EXCEPT the new Wicker Man made so much more sense because the background information provided and the spin on the story. Either way both are worth seeing one is a cult classic and the other should be seen to compare. Definitely unique and strange film made by the British and possibly one of their best. 6/10",The Wicker Man
41,Lejink,Strange goings-on in a small Scottish community...,7,15 July 2009,"Eerie and very disquieting low-budget British thriller from the early 70's. Edward Woodward plays the part of a workaday Presbyterian Scottish policeman who visits a remote island on a routine search for a young girl who's gone missing. Meeting a singular lack of cooperation from the local community he soon learns that their ways are not his resulting in a clash of beliefs, which under weight of numbers can result in only one loser and that in a bizarre sacrificial bonfire ritual within a wooden monolith called ""The Wicker Man"", which gives the movie its title.Beautifully shot in clear light, the movie gets stronger and stranger as it progresses but is so well directed and acted that you go along with its increasing improbabilities until the flaming end. Woodward (like all the leads) is no born-Scot but manages to look every inch the pious God-fearing Highlander, respectful of God to the extent that on his first night he can resist (but only just) the lustrous attractions of a sensually inflamed Britt Ekland (for the second time in British films, requiring to arouse herself in little or no clothes - remember the phone conversation with Michael Caine in ""Get Carter"") to save himself for his fiancée on the mainland.We, the viewers, like Woodward's Neil Howie character, are at first bemused and later repulsed by the pagan rituals and beliefs of the islanders which, although commonplace to them, run to strange dressings-up, nude dancing, very odd song lyrics and all the way ultimately to human sacrifice. The locals see nothing unusual in this, Christianity having been long-banished as the island's main religion. The acting of the two male leads is excellent, Woodward earnest but twitchy, Christopher Lee as the Lord of the Manor and ringleader of the rituals, debonair but menacing. It's one of the latter's best roles with nary a fang in sight. I'm not quite sure I believed Britt Ekland's Highland brogue but Diane Cilento (ex-wife of Sean Connery) is prim and sinister by turns as the local teacher who acts as Lee's amanuensis. The rest of the genuinely Scottish cast (I know, I'm Scottish and recognise many of their names and faces from TV and film) create a sense of foreboding throughout like a Greek chorus, by turns donning outlandish fertility traits and masks and droning a menacing hum as the mob gathers Woodward to his fate.There are so many weird and wonderful scenes here, obviously Ekland's famous nude dance for one, but also others like a child mischievously feigning death falling out of a wardrobe as Woodward searches for the missing girl, a mother making her daughter put a live frog in her mouth to cure a sore throat, the teenage girls nude dancing, right out of a Matisse or Fergusson (Scottish colourist) painting, before the fiery conclusion with Woodward inside the Wicker Man atop the hillside as the sun goes down.I'd read many conflicting accounts of this film but was delighted I ignored them and was rewarded with a movie experience that I'll not easily forget and with every other year bringing to light some disturbing story of a weird religious cult somewhere, this film will stay relevant for a long time to come, I don't doubt.",The Wicker Man

The film is a little gratuitous early on, with Britt Ekland writhing on the screen naked for several minutes, but as it settles in it gets disturbingly dark, leading to an unforgettable final half hour, starting with the costumes in a parade sequence and then out to the rugged cliffs on the shoreline. By having the cop be a devout Christian, the film also gets in some subversive commentary about religion as it puts it next to this cult. It's understated as a horror film and you have to bear with a dated soundtrack, but I loved its simplicity, and how it played out. Christopher Lee is great too.",The Wicker Man

It was weird watching this knowing how it would end. That still didn't take away any enjoyment from the film. What's great about this film is how philosophical it is.We get a lot of great points raised about religion and other things like sexuality. It was hard to recognize such a young Christopher Lee. The pacing in this film was great, especially with how it didn't feel too long or short.

47,johnnyboyz,Proof that the British horror genre was once great?,8,3 June 2008,"There is a distinct air of menace flowing throughout The Wicker Man, a distinct feeling of unwelcome and unkind put across in the most brilliant of manners because everyone acts so nicely. Then there is the awful feeling you get at certain points when you realise the character of Sergeant Howie (Woodward) is in actual fact a policeman and what might happen if he hadn't been. The Wicker Man is really a mere exercise in suspense on the surface but I think it toys with other, more political ideas during the core of the film before substituting everything and just focussing very briefly on the religious aspects it raises.For Sergeant Howie, he is bordering on the ultimate fish-out-of-water. Howie may be British and may well still be in Britain but that does not exclude him from the fish-out-of-water treatment that other film characters get when they are in that respective situation (see Doyle in 'French Connection II' and Neo in 'The Matrix' among many other examples). Howie is a man of pride; a man with ideas, discipline and rules and regulations he likes to stand by. He is a thorough man and this is partly his downfall since it is this case that is so difficult, it sees him assigned to it. Howie is on a remote Scottish isle investigating a disappearance of a young girl but while remaining within the boundaries of his own world; his own language and even his own country, Howie will find the going difficult and complicated due to several unsuspecting and eerie things.Firstly, the location of the island is important because it obviously resembles a sort of detachment from the mainland or indeed the rest of the world. There is special care taken to tell the audience as well as Howie that the mainland is a good week or so away by boat. So within this isolated utopia for the locals develops a sub-culture, a world in which people are people but methods of teaching, governing and religion are very different. This can be read into as some sort of political statement by the writer of the film  perhaps he is bringing to attention the level of policing in Britain for the time? There is no suspicion from Howie at all in the film but I noticed very quickly there was no police station nor was there any feeling that rules were apparent. The whole island was governed by a mysterious, never seen man and look at what situation the island locals were in, in terms of mentality.So if this island is a society without law and order; without a stone wall ruling on the most basic humane regulations, is the writer trying to bring to our attention the dangers of lack of authority in our own country? But The Wicker Man is not entirely an ambiguous text revolving around statements on our own world and society. It is a chilling and haunting horror film that predominantly falls into the 'Gothic' typecast due to its minute details on screen. There is a distinct ritualistic tone to the film and it is one that is fetishised. Several years earlier, Christopher Lee himself starred in the highly fetishised 'Dracula'. Here, shots of naked people sitting on grave stones and people having sex in graveyards, maybe to merely gross the 1973 audience out or to just make us aware that this is indeed going to be different, are included and add an ever present layer of disturbance but also one of ambiguity  why is it that people here do these things? To combine sex with a place of death can be linked with the film's overall theme. The man in the scene around the maypole sings a song about evolution and reproduction and generally about a certain circle of life. From here, it is only obvious that the act of reproduction (sex) to produce new life would take place in a location in which you bury the dead. Life goes on, it seems.Then there is that extra evidence to suggest this is one of the great Gothic horrors. How may of the cast are actually playing themselves? There are the people in the public house and the elderly folk by the harbour. This gives off its own air of disturbance in the sense they might be playing themselves and what with the commentary on society as a whole, the two seem to bind together all the too nicely. Then there is the attention to faces early on. The chocolates in the baker's window have faces on them and the close up of the pub sign has a face on it. There is also the excessive wearing of masks later on as identity is toyed and revealed but generally kept ambiguous. Is this the future of the society circa 1973? Do we know what we believe in terms of religion? And where we are going in the future? What about the schools and the policing? Will this be the sad reality of a nation gone mad if these things are cut back on? I think these are the sorts of questions the writers are raising by making a film like this and it must've been all the more disturbing in 1973.So if The Wicker Man succeeds as a statement then it certainly succeeds as a piece of Gothic horror. It mixes in the uncanny with the surreal and it carries a distinct atmosphere of dread all throughout. There is ambiguity all over the place but I especially liked the attention to the film's music: is it diegetic or not? Sometimes it is and others it isn't but it's such a head-trip of a soundtrack that it's difficult to notice most of the time. This surely one of the better British films ever made.",The Wicker Man
48,Fella_shibby,Quiet unnerving n truly one of the best horror film.,9,7 April 2020,"I first saw this in the late 80s on a vhs.
Revisited it recently. Upped the rating but won't give it 10 cos it contains blasphemous dialogues.The film's twist ending gave me goosebumps during those days. Suspense is maintained throughout n the performances r top notch. The film is not at all slow n in fact very engaging. The photography is another highlight along with Lee's performance.
The definition of slow burn applies to Vvitch, Hereditary, It comes at Night, etc. and I kinda avoid films if they r compared to the above mentioned films. But Wicker Man is not at all slow, mayb lengthy but terrifying without any gore, kills or jump scares.
This film is incomplete without Lee n this is one of the reason the remake starring Cage tanked. The thing I enjoyed in the remake was the cry of Nic Cage when he is beaten in a gunny bag.
But the original has plenty to offer. Check out the blonde babe Britt Ekland's naked dance against a wall which can still give men palpitations. They have used a body double for her glutes display as it was much bigger n the moves were pretty professional.",The Wicker Man
49,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Odd thriller that dares to prod popular opinions on religious morality,6,3 March 2010,"""The Wicker Man"" is a peculiar little film. It begins as a typical mystery: a Scottish detective travels to a remote Island off Scotland's coast where he is to investigate a report of a missing girl. Then the film mutates into a musical of sorts with numerous shots of topless women. Then it becomes a mystery again, this time fueled by religious beliefs. Undoubtedly paganism was an eye-opening concept in 1973 and while it doesn't completely translate in terms of effectiveness today, it presents an interesting theistic argument and lays the groundwork for a number of future thrillers that would employ similar twists.Edward Woodward stars as the police officer investigating into the missing girl, which is suspicious right off the bat. ""The Wicker Man"" is not particularly good at hiding the vital clues to the film's mystery, but then again this is thirty-some years and consequently more experience with the thriller genre talking. Presumably the rites and rituals of pagan culture mystified and perplexed people a bit more back then. Anyway, as he starts to look into the mystery the landlord's daughter (Britt Eckland) attempts to seduce him and the Summer Isle's lack of sexual censorship becomes 'celebrated' in the film.At first, ""The Wicker Man"" appears to attack the God-fearing Christian. Sgt. Howie, the detective, is outraged at the lack of Christian morality on the island. He can't believe that the church is no longer a church and that no priest or minister exists. His ignorance is laughable in a modern context, making his character a bit despicable. It is a film not kind to Christianity or at the least Christians who choose to remain ignorant about faiths that do not believe in Jesus Christ and are appalled that someone can practice them.Eventually that concept evolves. It still remains a film thematically based in religion, but Anthony Shaffer's story suggests that we not be so quick to pass judgment on those who believe differently and hold different moral standards than ourselves. The moral guidelines that different groups of people follow are not clear-cut; right and wrong is not so black and white. In that sense ""The Wicker Man"" is a brave film despite its flaws.It would be wrong to classify ""The Wicker Man"" as horror. It is a thriller with non-traditional religious themes that seem cultish and mysterious. It is a mystery that despite not being the most elaborate and impressive of story lines, is nonetheless unique and highly memorable. Undoubtedly anyone that sees this film will remember its final act, culminating in the burning of the wicker man.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com",The Wicker Man

51,FiendishDramaturgy,"Dated, atmospheric shocker still inspires",10,30 March 2004,"Gruesome and not all together accurate, depiction of the Old Pagan Ways, but beautiful in some ways, nonetheless.As a Pagan, I must say that I was not surprised to find that Pagans were depicted as the villains here. Such is the way of man, to fear what he does not understand, and to seek to destroy that which he fears.Other than that one gripe, I found the whole human sacrifice ploy to be indicative of the condition about which I first spoke. All religions of old practiced human sacrifice at one time or another, including the religion of choice of mainstream America; Christianity. I found it a convenient and contrived device to use here, after such beauty was displayed. But perhaps that was the intent of the director; to lull us with the wonders of Pagan revelry and then murder that lulled sense of placation with the horrors that follow.Whichever the case, it worked. This movie is a beautiful glimpse into the world which was, and then you are plunged into the darker side of that same world.As Satanists/Luciferians are considered to be a Christian heresy, so is the type of rite featured at the end of this movie, to the Pagan community at large. The burning of the ""stuffy guy,"" ""corn man,"" ""wicker man,"" or ""John Barleycorn"" is a beautiful and sacred tradition among many in the Pagan fold, as there are as many denominations of Paganism as there are in Christianity. The corn man was filled with animals raised as sacrament to the God of the Hunt. Fresh fruits and grains (the best of the previous year's harvest) were placed into the corn man's extremities, he was erected and burned as a burnt offering to the Goddess as a wedding present. She marries the God on Beltane, or May Day if you prefer.Macy's still has a beautiful May Day parade, and many schools still celebrate May Day with festivals; some still featuring the May Pole.Just as there are fall festivals, there are still spring festivals the world over. Most do not remember why, but some of us do.I found the duplicity of this particular group of Pagans to be delightfully dark and highly enjoyable; sneaky, underhanded and just wrong, but enjoyable to watch.But if you are not of the Pagan Folds, never fear. This movie does not glamorize Paganism. To the contrary, it drags us back to the Dark Ages when human sacrifice was an acceptable means of offering, and human life was not yet considered sacred. So it will sit well with your fine sensibilities and not compromise your self-righteous indignations.Watch it for yourself to witness one of the most beautifully dark movies to ever be committed to film.It rates a 9.8/10 from...the Fiend :.",The Wicker Man
52,hellraiser7,Strange Faith,10,21 July 2012,"One of the other things about suspense thrillers that make them suspenseful is the protagonist forced out of his or her comfort zone or element, this it's based on our subconscious fear of an area were not familiar with or even understand will turn against us. This film isn't exactly a horror movie, it's more of a supernatural suspense thriller.And the film may have been one of the partial inspirations for ""The X-Files"" yeah I could see an episode of Mulder and Skully visiting this island.The suspense is of a different kind, it's similar to the films ""Angel Heart"" and ""The Ninth Gate"" where on the surface it seems like a simple cut and dry hunt to find someone or something. But as you get more deeply engaged in the mystery you have a feel or realize it's about a lot more. It's all a math equation where you know it's all going to add up to something but the question is what. It's suspenseful because we know that the protagonist really should quit at some point because you have a feel if not exact proof that whatever it all adds up to it's not good. But at the same time you can't help but want to see it though to the end because you simply want to know what it all means; it's the common strength and folly of the need to know.I love the sense of isolation which adds to the unsafe feeling. There is just no one you really can trust in this film not just from the unusual nature of the people but that none are whom they seem, most I never found completely likable because it's like their nice but then their not. My favorite suspenseful moment no doubt is the game of chance where everyone has to be in line to stand inside a series of sword blades in the form of a star for an amount of time, if one is left in the circle when time runs out well you can guess what happens next.The visual and production value is great, it was fascinating and really strange at the same time just seeing the Celtic Pagan practices exercised in modern times, it really has the feeling of a world where these practices are the norm. My favorite is no doubt seeing the may day festival and everyone in all those bizarre masks and costumes, it was sort of the pagan version of Marti Graz. I even like the in-depth knowledge on all the pagan symbols and rituals, hearing about it made me want to know more.The music is great as well despite not my style it really fits with the film. And this film has a lot of music moments which almost makes this film a bit of a musical, and one of the ones I personally in my book since I personally am not a fan of the genre only other one I like is ""Dr.Horrible's Sing A Long Blog"" but that's a different story. Anyway, I really like the music and songs because of how strange they are as well as their sexuality overtones.The late Edward Woodward as Sergent Howie is good. It's true his character isn't totally likable, he's kinda repressed, pompous, not cool. However he's worthy of some sympathy because he has common sense and clearly out of place in the island. You can emphasize with his disorientation as we see in his eyes certain things that even we don't see everyday. Like seeing sexual acts in the public eye, naked girls in some fertility dance jumping though a bon fire (wonder if anyone ever died in that one), and others I don't want to give away you have to see to believe. You can share a bit in his disdain because certain things people do and say are ethically questionable.But to me the one character that really drives this film for me is Lord Summerisle played by one of my favorite actors Christopher Lee. This to me is probably my favorite role from him because his character is sort of on the gray area because he's not exactly a villain despite what he does at the end he would be. I find his character likable he feels like someone I could be friends with; he has charisma, he's interesting seems to have a lot of hobbies, he loves having fun and life, sociable. However he also has a sinister nature that brews within and when we see it near the end it is both disarming and sends a chill.The interesting thing about the film is seeing the constant conflict in both the Christianity and Pagan faiths. Both Howie and Lord Summerisle I feel are two sides of the same coin, both of them are strongly devoted in what they believe in. But their folly is in their inflexibility from Howie's lack of understanding of the culture as well as his repression which keeps him from being more human. Summerisle isn't completely up to the times and it's ethical boundaries, he believes that the old ways still work but when time moves on it always produces different results.The ending is unforgettable, seeing it turned my blood cold because I knew in that moment there was nothing more anyone could do.If your looking for something different in the suspense thriller genre then give this film a try, I guarantee you you won't get burned.Rating: 4 stars",The Wicker Man
53,bsmith5552,The Hunter Becomes the Hunted!,8,1 August 2018,"""The Wicker Man"" is referred to by some as ""the thinking man's horror film"". It IS different.Sgt. Howie (Edward Woodward) is sent to an offshore little island off Scotland known as Summerisle to follow up on a missing persons report on a young girl. When he arrives, he is met by a suspicious group of citizens who deny ever knowing the young girl. He pursues his investigation meeting with little success. The sexy daughter of the local Innkeeper, Willow Britt Ekland) tries to seduce Howie who is a devout Christian. The next day he discovers that the girl had been part of the local school after interrogating Miss Rose (Diane Cilento), the teacher.Howie later meets the island's patriarch, Lord Summerisle (Christopher Lee in a god awful toupee) who offers little help. Howie begins to suspect that the girl has been murdered. He manages to find her grave only to discover that a rabbit has been placed in her coffin. He goes to the Office of Records where the librarian (Ingrid Pitt) reluctantly shows that no death certificate for the girl exists.Along the way, Howie is exposed to the islander's odd rites and ceremonies. He deduces that they are all part of a pagan cult. Ceremonies are planned for May Day to offer sacrifices to their false gods to ensure a better crop season the next year. During a ceremonial march led by Lord Summerisle (in yet another horrendous wig) Howie dressed in a ceremonial costume, sees the young girl for whom he has been searching and tries to rescue her.Emerging from a cave, Howie is met by Lord Summerisle , Miss Rose, Willow and others. It seems that he has been set up to become a human sacrifice rather than the young girl. The hunter has become the hunted. Howie is prepared for his meeting with ""The wicker Man"" and...........................................This movie has become a cult classic over the years. It starts out as a detective story and evolves into the horrific finale. Edward Woodward is excellent as the skeptical Howie and Lee is more than a bit over the top as the pagan leader. Cilento, Ekland and Pitt add various feminine touches to the proceedings. I must say that the end result caught me a little off guard.It's a good movie.",The Wicker Man
54,Stevieboy666,Folk Horror Masterpiece,10,30 October 2019,"A devout Christian policeman flies to a remote Scottish island to investigate the disappearance of a young girl, only to be met with hostility from the pagan locals.
This is not your typical horror movie, although the occult is at the core the horror is psychological as opposed to manifestations of demons, etc. It is a slow but gripping burn that culminates in one of the most powerful and disturbing finales ever.
Beautifully shot showcasing some stunning locations, the film also boasts a superb cast and a terrific musical score. Christopher Lee and Edward Woodward give possibly their best performances. Britt Ekland is dubbed, but she looks great! And it was great seeing Ingrid Pitt and Christopher Lee together, as a horror fan I can't help but think of Count and Countess Dracula!
I have just seen the Director's Cut. There is more footage but personally I don't think that it adds much to the Theatrical version.

55,kevin_robbins,I have no complaints about this movie and would easily score it a 10/10.,10,4 June 2021,"Wicker Man (1973) is a movie I recently rewatched on Shudder. This review is for my good friend Finnigan Somers. Hope you and your family are doing as well as you can be. The storyline for this picture is about a detective who receives an anonymous letter about a missing child from a desolate island. He flies a private plan to the island and discovers a strange religious cult but no sign of the child. As he understands the cult's way of life more things just get more twisted and instead of saving a child he may need to save himself. This movie is directed by Robin Hardy (The Fantasist) in his directorial debut and stars Christopher Lee (Lord of the Rings), Edward Woodward (The Equalizer), Diane Cilento (Hombre) and Britt Ekland (The Man with the Golden Gun). The storyline for this is delivered so well. It is setup by a mesmerizing soundtrack that is perfect for the content. The mystery behind the letter and the European feel were so much better than the remake. This also did a good job depicting the orgies and sex scenes in a fairly subtle fashion. They also did a great job depicting the cults way of life with home remedies, masks, school sequences, etc. And Willow in this movie, two thumbs up . The conclusion is obviously all time great and well delivered. I have no complaints about this movie and would easily score it a 10/10.",The Wicker Man

Further, why did they feel the need to remake it with Nicholas Cage (and even worse movie) when the first one wasn't any great shakes, either.Okay, the Cage movie sucked because Cage can't act. (Why no one in Hollywood has realized this yet is beyond me.) This one had good actors, Edward Woodward and the legendary Christopher Lee. It still stunk. Filled with a lot of bad Scottish folk songs (and I mean a lot of them), neo-Pagan mumbo-jumbo, lots of people with bad teeth and a hero who gets killed for trying to do the right thing, it just wasn't really scary or very interesting.",The Wicker Man

It strikes me as self defeating to do this in horror since the point is basically to worry for them. Sadly the locals are hardly better when it comes to sanctimonious spiritual lectures which make this one of those tragically flawed films that were made of such good stuffIt's bizarre how often I forgot this movie when trying to compile good horror. I very honorable mention for what it does right even if it does a few thing wrong. I'm not even sure the makers really had horror in mind. I think the writer had a dream one night and was trying to deliver this aesthetic of a place, detached from modernity where forgotten traditions blossom.By turns, enchanting, idyllic and disquieting, Christopher Lee is of course impeccable.Amazing ending.",The Wicker Man
58,MBunge,One of the few truly horrifying horror movies,8,22 October 2010,"Most horror movies never live up to that name. They're actually ""scare movies"" or ""shock movies"" or even ""sick titillation"" movies. The Wicker Man, though, is true to its genre. This film will unsettle, it will disturb and it will horrify you.Sergeant Howie (Edward Woodward) is a policeman summoned to a tiny island off the coast of Scotland to investigate the disappearance of a child. From the very moment he lands his seaplane and sets foot on Summerisle, Howie finds nothing but confusion and oddity. He can't get a straight answer from anyone about what happened to the girl or if she even existed. The girl's own mother won't tell him the truth. Howie does observe strange rituals, midnight orgies and blasphemous behavior. He finally meets Lord Summerisle (Christopher Lee), who won't give him any answers about the missing girl but does tell Howie of the history of the island and the pagan religion that took hold of it. It is in that heathen worship that Howie comes to suspect that the missing girl's fate was deathor something worse.There is a lot to praise about The Wicker Man, but you have to start by lauding the two elements that have become the unique calling cards of this movie. Firstly, this is probably the only truly Christian horror movie. And I don't mean there are a bunch of demons and angels in the story or anything like that. At the heart of this film is a conflict between Christian faith and Christian living and the ancient superstitions and practices of paganism. Beyond a threat to life and limb, this movie challenges Christian belief and propriety. There is a lot of nudity and bawdiness in the story, but its presence is not to arouse but to tempt Christian virtue. The Wicker Man is a movie about depravity, degeneracy, brutality and death that remains suitable material for a church group because of the undeniably Christian dynamic at its heart.The other defining aspect of this film is that it is probably the only true horror-musical. There is a lot of people singing in this movie and none of it is meant to be ironic of comedic or to wink at the audience in some fashion. All of the songs and music play a role in creating and establishing the crazy and evil society Sergeant Howie falls into. Not only does it make everything on the island seem unreal and otherworldly, but the contrast between the jolly, happy songs of the pagans and the ominous and terrible acts that occur amplifies the discomfort and unease in the viewer.Edward Woodward and Christopher Lee are outstanding as the parochially Christian Sergeant Howie and the paradoxically more worldly pagan Lord Summerisle. The clash between these two men is one of the great standoffs in horror cinema and neither swings and ax or waives a machete at the other. Woodward plays a man of rigid faith but never lets that rigidity imprison Howie or turn him into an unsympathetic martinet. Lee's performance is even more subtle, playing a character who's meant to be more in tune with the feelings and attitudes of modern audiences yet never letting viewers ignore or deny the evil that dwells in Summerisle's heart.There's very little graphic violence in The Wicker Man and it's from an era when horror movies would often start out like a different kind of film, in this case a missing person mystery, before twisting into something awful before the audience's very eyes. So, if you've been weaned on the gorefests and overwrought suspense of horror films in the last several decades, you might need to have a little patience. If you stick with it, though, this movie will creep you out like few things you have ever seen. The Wicker Man is not a thrill ride. It is not supposed to be funny or exciting. It is a horror movie. Watch it at your own risk.And for pete's sake, make sure when you rent it that you're getting the original and not the thrice-damned remake starring Nicholas Cage. That one isn't a horror movie. It's just horrifyingly awful.",The Wicker Man
59,Lechuguilla,Technologically Outdated,4,6 May 2014,"It was all I could do to get through most of the plot, owing to its redundancy. Most of it can be summarized by the simple question: ""Where is Rowan Morrison?"", the good cop Sergeant Howie (Edward Woodward) keeps asking, first of this person, then of that group, then of some other person, over and over and over, through two-thirds of the film. Then rather suddenly toward the end, the story's underlying premise becomes apparent, but then the ending, too, gets stretched out. There's no gradual escalation in the story, just a seemingly endless loop of repetitious plot for over an hour, followed by a long, drawn-out ending.Once we approach the end, we can see that the film has some thematic value, or at least it did back when it was made. But with ever-increasing technological interconnectedness the story's underlying theme is trending outdated.Even for 1973, the script is not well thought out, with huge lapses in logic and some plot holes involving both Howie and the residents. Further, I find the residents foppish, self-satisfied, and annoyingly blithe. None of the characters are worth caring about.Cinematography, casting, and acting are generally credible, though Woodward's performance at the end is melodramatic; perhaps that was the Director's fault. There is no score. The various songs are unmemorable.This story could have been told in thirty minutes, with the first twenty devoted to investigative questions and the final ten devoted to the ending, with its genuinely unique visuals of the wicker figure high on a hillside against the backdrop of the setting sun. The visuals here are captivating. But the script is poorly written, and the overall story, and its attendant theme, is fast becoming irrelevant here in the twenty-first century.",The Wicker Man
60,smatysia,Very odd; definitely worth a look,8,12 February 2005,"Wow. What an unusual film. I had never heard of this one, in spite of a fairly well-known international cast. Britt Ekland was awfully pretty, and performed very well, even though her singing, and possibly her dialog was dubbed. I saw an apparently shortened version of this film, and I think some of the cuts were to the bone. I hope to see the full version in the future. The ending would have been shocking to me, if I had not read too much about the film on IMDb.

61,barnabyrudge,"Tremendous, atmospheric horror film with an unforgettable ending.",10,19 February 2006,"The Wicker Man is an outstanding horror film from 1973 - perhaps the finest British horror film of all-time, and certainly a film that weaves an absorbing spell on a whole range of levels. It is not a horror film in the sense of buckets of blood and gore. Nor is it a horror film with ghosts and creaking doors and strange sounds in the night. The film plays out more like an enigmatic mystery thriller, with the horror coming right at the very end when we learn where the narrative has been leading us all along. In fact, The Wicker Man has a classic climax that will both surprise and unsettle viewers who are new to the movie. It is an ending far more memorable, and horrific in a subtle way, than any shock moment in, say, an Italian gore film.Deeply religious Christian policeman Sergeant Howie (Edward Woodward) flies out to the remote Scottish island of Summerisle to investigate the disappearance of a young girl. Almost immediately upon arriving, he finds the islanders alternately unwelcoming or downright peculiar. The missing girl's mother, May Morrison (Irene Sunters), claims that she never even had a daughter; the locals in the island pub refuse to acknowledge the girl's existence; and at the island school, the pupils and the teacher (Diane Cilento) say they've never heard of the missing girl. Howie is equally perturbed by some of the other events he witnesses - the pub landlord willingly surrenders his daughter for sexual hijinks; the children at the school are taught about phallic imagery and are encouraged to dance naked through flames; pagan symbols are to be found everywhere. The entire island seems lost under the sinister spell of Lord Summerisle (Christopher Lee), and Sgt. Howie becomes increasingly certain that his missing girl may be the victim of some kind of pagan sacrifice....To reveal much more would be to rob the viewer of a staggering conclusion. Let's just say that Howie finds out all too plainly what is really going on by the film's end. Woodward gives a career-best performance in the film, etching a remarkable portrayal of a devout man who is so bound to his moral code that he is sometimes as dislikable as he is honourable. Lee excels too as the island's top man - this is one of the great roles of his prolific career. The film switches from police mystery to pagan horror, with frequent pauses for atmospheric folk songs, and is at all stages a work of real intelligence. In both its shorter theatrical version and the longer Director's Cut, it tells an enthralling story while keeping its trump card cunningly disguised. There aren't many movies in the history of the medium that are genuine ""must sees"".... The Wicker Man, though, is one of the few!",The Wicker Man
62,drownnnsoda,Terrifying Collision Of Religious Beliefs.,9,10 July 2006,"I hadn't really heard of ""The Wicker Man"" before, but after learning about a remake being set for 2006, I decided to look into this and see what it was all about, so I went and rented it. The result - well, it was actually pretty good. ""The Wicker Man"" is about a devout Christian detective, Seargant Howie, who arrives at Summerisle, an isolated island off the coast of Scotland. He is there to investigate the disappearance of a young girl. While the island folk seem a little strange, he continues his investigation, asking all local residents and businesses on the island, and keeps on hitting dead ends. But as time goes by and Seargant Howie observes the islander's Pagan rituals, he begins to suspect that the young girl may have been chosen for a human sacrifice. In a race against time to save the girl, Seargant Howie soon finds out that he may be the one who needs to be saved...I found this movie to be really interesting, the whole story was well done and like nothing that I've ever seen before. The film was rather short, running at 84 minutes long. As I understand it, Europe has a 100 minute director's edition that is available, so maybe those extra 16 minutes contained footage that was beneficial to the movie, because it was pretty short. Who knows? Even with it's brisk running time, the subject matter is compelling, watching the rituals and different beliefs put in action by the islanders was interesting enough. The overtones of paganism and ancient religious beliefs was really intriguing and an interesting subject matter. As the strange rituals take place, leading up to the sacrificial ceremony, the suspense level is quite high, especially when the twist is introduced. I didn't really find the film to be 'scary' per se, I found it to be more bizarre, but in a good way. Horror legend Christopher Lee gave a good performance as the strange leader of the island, and Edward Woodward was fitting as Seargant Howie, the narrow-minded detective. Britt Ekland also turns in a memorable performance as the odd young woman named Willow. The whole atmosphere of the island, and the creepy music and rituals are what made the movie so eerie I believe. The sense of being in a foreign place, surrounded by things you don't understand is really frightening. And the abrupt, brutal ending makes the film even harder to forget, it sticks in your mind for days. Bottom line is, ""The Wicker Man"" is a classic horror movie in almost every way, but if you're a horror fan who is limited to slasher, chop-em-up horror movies, ""The Wicker Man"" isn't for you. It emanates a sense of foreboding and a feeling of being surrounded by people whom you don't understand, which can surprisingly be a terrifying premise. Check it out if you appreciate older horror films, it's a must-see suspense thriller and will leave you thinking about it days after viewing, especially after the shocker of an ending. 9/10.",The Wicker Man
63,Cristi_Ciopron,"striking, lavish movie, all sensation",9,28 December 2015,"This striking, lavish shocker has an undeniable freshness and force and appeal, and is so exquisitely crafted, that many misunderstand it; as, although sensational, it isn't either sensationalist or exploitative, yet it doesn't take up ineffable emotions (others than those basically allowed for by the situation and the genre), sentiments, empathy, ideas or meaning, safe for the minimal psychology needed, because there's no interaction other than a deceitful and hopeless one, between a visitor on the island and the masks, and the islanders are shown only as deceivers, so that the copper is the only one characterized, in his interactions with a world of deceiving masks (two phony religions are opposed: a phony, gain-driven heathenism, and a phony Christianity, the heathenism is boosted by the Summerisle's lord need for gain, on a fruitful island the people eat fruits from the cans, this heathenism isn't idyllic, and the copper's death, though echoing the lines from S. Paul, has him cursing his enemies). But then, its art in offering something so suspenseful is all the more awesome, because it has to rely mostly on beauty, music and feeling, on atmosphere; the score has many folk tunes, pop music, which I enjoyed. The dreamy, feverish feel also comes from this plausible premise, of a person meeting only masks, in the remote place where he lands; therefore, if all has been deceit, all has been dreamy and ungrounded, and the script means to have it entirely so, since very few of the copper's former life is evoked, it's an experience of a labyrinth, with laconic psychology, and since then some other genre movies have been made in the same spirit, where a protagonist with a basic psychology has an experience of a puzzling situation, with a sense of menace, and this makes the '73 work a classic genre movie, and it's unfair to ask from it what it hasn't been supposed to be (e.g., a drama). One has to have the dignity and honor of acknowledging a good genre movie, and this one certainly is a masterpiece.Its New Age isn't glamorized at all. There are clues: the lack of fruits is due do the last year's bad crop. On the other hand, the storyline's logic is dreamlike: the bewitched islanders picked the copper, selected him, but how did they find him, how did they know whom to lure there? The copper doesn't phone, doesn't inform his office, doesn't keep in touch with the outside world, doesn't report, and we are in the '70s, and if an anonymous letter has been followed by an inquiry, the copper's disappearance would be as well. If he would of accepted the local Aphrodite's advances, if he would of surrendered sexually, would that of saved him? Does he ever get a chance? Hiding a girl is one thing, hiding the murder of a policeman is different. What are the islanders' chances in getting away with it? The islanders don't stage an accidental death, but a holocaust.It has a strong leading man, Woodward. The copper doing research in a public library, reading about occultism, must be an early use of the trope.Another good occasion for us to remember Lee, here as the master of Summerisle.",The Wicker Man

65,rooprect,The most 70s thriller ever. That's a compliment.,8,9 May 2017,"This movie is so 70s, theaters offered 3-for-1 seats so guys could park their sideburns. This movie is so 70s, you'll need a special 8-track adapter to play it in your blu-ray. This movie is so 70s, the only bras you'll see are on Erin Go.(Get it? Erin go bra--? OK I'll stop now.)Ah yes, the 70s thriller. Stepford Wives, Coma, The China Syndrome, and the 70sest of them all, ""The Wicker Man"" are films characterized by a very cynical and existentialist ""lone person against a world gone mad"" vibe which probably mirrored society's reluctant awakening from 60s hippie flower power into the catastrophic reality of the Cold War, Watergate, and Volkswagen discontinuing production of the Beetle which I still can't believe.""The Wicker Man"" is the pinnacle of 70s awesomeness, beginning with the lone protagonist Sgt. Howie (Edward Woodward) arriving on an island of creepy, smiling, sex obsessed folks and their leader Lord Summerisle (Christopher Lee), proceeding through bizarre musical numbers as comedically dark as anything in The Rocky Horror Picture Show but with traditional Irish instruments, gaining momentum as our hero quickly pieces together the clues of a murder/disappearance which the townsfolk ""cover up"" with about as much subtlety as the Three Mile Island nuke meltdown, and finally depositing us at a dramatic, exciting conclusion as shocking and perfect as the death of disco.""The Wicker Man"" has it all. Well, everything except for Nicolas Cage's epic bad acting in the remake (""Oh god not the bees!!"" Lmao). No, despite the fact that I may sound like I'm calling this movie campy, it's actually very well done. You'll be amazed at how a single scene can blend singing & dancing with murder, powerful acting, the sexual frustration of our 40 year old virgin hero, and a seductive nude number courtesy of the delectable Britt Ekland, homina homina. Did I just blow your mind? Well buckle up your bell bottoms because it gets better, bucko.But rather than reveal anything more of the story, I'll just leave it to you to experience. If you're a fan of 70s thrillers like the ones I've mentioned, as well as lesser known cult gems like ""A Boy and His Dog"", ""Phantasm"" and ""Zardoz"", then pull up your favorite bean bag, dim the lava lamps, pop open a Fresca and watch ""The Wicker Man"".

69,Witchfinder-General-666,"Fascinating, Bizarre, Brilliant, Beautiful and Unlike Anything Else!",10,16 February 2009,"The great Christopher Lee, who agreed to appear in this film for free, is said to consider ""The Wicker Man"" of 1973 the greatest film he was ever part of. For good reasons, as this is one of the most unique and original cinematic masterpieces ever brought to screen and an absolute must-see for everybody interested in film. I will not try to discuss whether this is a Horror film or not. The unique greatness of ""The Wicker Man"" combines elements from a variety of genres, Horror, Thriller, Mystery, Fantasy, Drama, and even Musical, but it can not really be limited to one particular genre. ""The Wicker Man"" is one of the most essential films for any lover of Horror and Cult-Cinema to see for a variety of reasons. Firstly, this film profits from one of the greatest scripts ever written. The convoluted and fascinating story of ""The Wicker Man"" from the pen of Anthony Shaffner, who had previously written the screenplays to ""Sleuth"" (1972) and Alfred Hitchcock's ""Frenzy"" (also 1972) is based on David Pinner's novel ""Ritual"". Though I have never read the novel, I must say that Shaffner more than deserves to be called a genius for how he transferred it into one of the most intriguing scripts in film history.Scottish police sergeant Howie (Edward Woodward) is called by an anonymous letter to investigate the disappearance of a young girl on the remote Scottish island Summerisle. Upon his arrival, nobody seems to have ever heard of the girl. The deeply religious Sergeant Howie, however, is shocked to find out that the residents of the island, above all the sophisticated but mysterious Lord Summerisle (Christopher Lee), are practicing a pagan customs and free sexuality...As said above, the ingenious script by Anthony Shaffner must be one of the most brilliant that was ever written. Robin Hardy's direction also deserves utmost praise, however. The beautiful Scottish landscapes are a wonderful setting for this fascinating film, the cinematography is brilliant, and, above all, the film provides one of the most unique scores. Beautiful Scottish folk songs go in hand with gripping suspense, surrealism and convoluted mystery. Another outstanding quality of ""The Wicker Man"" is the brilliant cast. Edward Woodward is excellent in the role of Sergeant Howie, who has little understanding for non-Christian beliefs. The character of Sergeant Howie is another brilliant aspect of the story. At first one does not really know whose side to be on - that of the dutiful but narrow-minded Sergeant, or that of the open-minded, but mysterious pagans. The incomparable Christopher Lee, one of the greatest actors ever in my opinion, delivers one of his greatest performances as the mysterious Lord Summerisle, another character which makes this film so brilliant and unique. The female cast includes Swedish beauty queen Britt Eckland as the innkeeper's seductive daughter Willow, Diane Cilento as the school teacher, and Ingrid Pitt, sexy leading woman of several Hammer Horror films, as a librarian. Actually, it must be said that all the performances are great here. Lee and Woodward, of course, range at the very top, and Britt Eckland is too beautiful to be true. All said, ""The Wicker Man"" has everything one could possibly desire in cinema, stunning suspense and genuine creepiness, complex mystery, delightfully bizarre weirdness, overwhelming settings and photography, brilliant performances and intriguing characters, beautiful and hypnotic music, and one of the most mesmerizing story lines ever in cinema. A remake was made in 2006, which I will never watch as the mere thought of it disgusts me. This 1973 original is one of the most unique, fascinating and compelling experiences a cineaste can have, one of the greatest British films of all-time and a masterpiece that no lover of cinema can afford to miss! The 100 minute director's cut is essential. 10/10",The Wicker Man
70,ferbs54,Love Britt's Dance,10,20 December 2007,"I had wanted to see this cult item for many years, and finally caught up with it the other day. This is a terrific film, beautifully shot, wonderfully acted and intelligently written. Christopher Lee has called it his best role, and he is excellent in his portrayal of the pagan leader, Lord Summerisle. The film is filled with bizarre touches, haunting music and genuinely macabre scenes, all leading up to the shocking--and, sad to say, all too believable--conclusion. Britt Ekland's nude pagan dance will long remain in your memory; trust me on this one! The film version on the DVD that I just watched, despite the fact that it IS the edited print, and NOT the full-length director's cut, is a winner in every way. A 1/2-hour documentary at the film's conclusion helps to alleviate the fact that this IS the abridged edition.",The Wicker Man
71,aidanratesmovies,A Very Peculiar but Unique Thriller,9,26 April 2020,"Entertaining, unique, and well crafted- The Wicker Man may not be perfect, but is surely a one of a kind thriller unlike any before. Edward Woodward and Christopher Lee provide for some great all out performances, which is both very rare for this type of film in its time, and groundbreaking because of it so. The film is a bit slow at times, but for the majority it provides a very peculiar, strangely interesting, and entertaining experience unlike no other. The film is full of music, of which I did not expect nor did in concept would I expect to like, but provides a very interesting and creepy atmospheric element to the film that truly fits its very unique style. The cinematography is quite nice, with some cool camera angles, and some truly beautiful shots. In the end, The Wicker Man does have a bit of a problem with pacing, but for the majority of the films short run, it is a very peculiar and unique thriller that is not only ahead of its time, but very smart and interesting as well.
My Rating: 9.25/10",The Wicker Man
72,truemythmedia,Brilliant Folk Horror,8,26 November 2019,"On its surface ""The Wicker Man"" is about a police officer who is investigating the disappearance of a girl from a small island community. He meets nothing but resistance and opposition from the village as they are not very interested in outsiders and are also preparing for their big May Day celebration and would rather he not be around for it.As he learns more our police officer is apalled to find out that the community is a sort of revival village for paganism and the many songs he hears, interactions he has, and confusions he endures revolve around the culture shock of being in a world of people who don't think the way you do.This subtext is the most interesting aspect of the film to me. The way that witchcraft, paganism, and humanism are expressed is in many ways similar to the way a person who is Christian might feel in a community of all Buddhists or a Muslim might feel in a community of all Atheists.At first, it seems that while there may be differences in many areas, on the whole they should be able to get along. It is only after a considered screw-down into the details that it becomes apparent that they have intractable differences, not just surface ones.I don't know how much of this is intentional but it was the main thing I was feeling all the way through the film. Until the final facade is dropped and the heinousness of their communal intentions are revealed, there doesn't seem to be any reason that the police should care at all about what they are doing. They aren't hurting anyone and while their beliefs might make some roll their eyes, the same could be said of any religion or philosophy.It isn't until it is revealed that they have violent intentions beneath it all that all the awkward feelings and confusion that had permeated the film coalesce into the cruel scheme in which Sgt. Howie had been an unwitting pawn.It is a film about self delusion, communal story, and appearance vs substance. It's about knowing and how we know, fear of those who are different, and the limits of personal authority and autonomy.Strangely, I find it to be a strongly conservative film as many of the issues brought up from below the surface are typically fears of isolationists and fearful communities who are unsure of their ability to withstand cultural change or difference. Unfortunately that is also exactly the kind of person who typically would not watch this movie because of the paganism that is depicted within it. I do think there would be great value in it for those sorts of people though, if they could find a way to see beneath the imagery used and realize how much they have in common with the pagans in this film and also with Sgt Howie.Movies like this are not valuable because they are so intense (although it is) or because they portray us exactly as we see ourselves. The value blow the surface of this film is that the characters are so different from us that we are able to insert ourselves and our own issues beneath the metaphors the film maker is employing.It is precisely because the extreme to which this community takes their belief is further than I would go that makes me ask questions of myself and how far I would take certain beliefs especially when they run up against another.It is a warning of how manipulative, conniving, and cold we can be toward ""the other"" within our communities and an exhortation not to let ourselves go that way. Caring only for ourselves and our own small niches, silos, and facebook groups carries with it the huge danger of misunderstanding, not trying to understand, or not even not listening to people who aren't in our circle of confirming friendships even those who show up on our shores for altogether good or righteous intentions.",The Wicker Man

Shocks are so much better absorbed with the knees bent.",8,27 June 2012,"An absolutely outstanding film and way superior to the remake, Edward Woodward, who went on to do ""The Equalizer"" ten years after this, was brilliant as Sergeant Howie, a devout Christian who was absolutely shocked at the goings on on the island. The best part was when he was mesmerized by Willow's (Britt Ekland) sensuous dance in the adjoining room. He couldn't deal with the copious nudity and symbols of sex all around him.Christopher Lee was also extremely good as Lord Summerisle and lay a brilliant trap that we are all familiar with.Ingrid Pitt also gave great delight when Sergeant Howie was searching the village.The music was captivating and the whole scenery was perfect for the story.",The Wicker Man
74,Galina_movie_fan,This is how the horror movies should be made,10,22 November 2007,"""The Wicker Man"" (1973) which is known as one of the best British horror movies and has achieved the cult status since it was released over thirty years ago, is much more than just a horror. It very creatively and successfully mixes straight crime/mystery with horror, thriller, and occult drama, throwing in the elements of musical. The story (written by Anthony Shaffer) is always interesting and the characters are well developed and memorable. Where the film succeeds entirely, it is in slow build of unbearable tension that makes its final both inevitable and unbelievable.""The Wicker Man"" follows the disappearance of a young girl on the remote Scottish island Summerisle. Sergeant Howie of Scotland Yard (Edward Woodward), the serious and rather humorless but decent man whom we would eventually identify with, arrives to Summersville to find the girl but the locals claim that she never existed. Soon he realizes that cheerful and smiling residents of the island, adults and children led by their spiritual leader Lord Summersisle (Christopher Lee) are engaged in the pagan religion with the rituals that shock and disgust devoted Christian Howie. The film maintains sensual, creepy, ominous atmosphere throughout yet often makes you smile and in the end leaves you totally stunned. The cinematography is breathtaking, the songs and musical score are beautiful and take the important part in the plot. Even if you guess correctly where the movie takes you, you will be undeniably shocked and disturbed when you see where exactly it took you.P.S. It's been few weeks since I saw the movie but I still wonder whether the harvest on the island improves the following year.",The Wicker Man
75,nycritic,The Darkness Lurking Under All Those Smiles,10,4 September 2006,"Anthony Shaffer's THE WICKER MAN has become over the years a cult classic of modern horror due to the fact that while it never points at anything other than what is on the surface, it taps into tradition on both sides of religion. On one side, there is the faith that we've come to know as Christianity (although it could also be Catholicism, if you will). Sergeant Neil Howie (Edward Woodward) is at this end of the spectrum. His devoutness is quite strong, but even then he's not a Bible-thumper nor a promoter of the Word. On the other side is the entire community known as Summerisle, a place founded by the forefathers of Lord Summerisle (Christopher Lee), people who have joined forces to create a society in which paganism is the norm. For Howie, a man who represents the uninitiated, their constant cheerfulness as they dance around the May pole and sing folk songs; their casual yet ritualistic approach to sex; their beliefs and education system brings forth a shock. He is clearly on foreign land, and his search for the missing girl he has been summoned to find will lead him to a surprising discovery.Even then, the question that arises from what the end result is: will Summerisle's offering truly bring a successful harvest? Their last harvest was a failure -- crops did not grow -- and once the question is verbalized by Howie himself, for a second, Lord Summerisle's eyes fall to the ground, downcast. It's a reminder of a near identical scene in a similar story, Shirley Jackson's ""The Lottery"". Questions arise throughout snippets of narration as the preparation for the lottery goes on, if this is all necessary. One person answers that it's been discontinued in neighboring towns. Another one blames the new generation doesn't respect tradition. And Tess Hutchinson, like Howie, comes to realize too late what the lottery really is. Like Hutchinson, Howie allows himself to get drawn in the seduction that is fleshed out by Willow's (Britt Ekland) erotic dance as well as his moral sense of duty to save the life of this young girl. And like Hutchinson, Howie fails to see the extremism within the hedonism of Summerisle.Mislabeled as a horror movie, THE WICKER MAN is far from it, even though the ending is what people will debate. Cleverly drawing the viewer in for a meandering investigation, it misleads the viewer as it blithely throws its secret onto the foreground more than once and even adds several musical numbers that are sweetly ominous in their own way. Strong actors hold the movie up high and misdirect the viewer even more, thinking they will see a dead-on horror film: Christopher Lee, a veteran of horror films, plays against type as a congenial man with that baritone voice that commands attention (and even sings a song). Ingrid Pitt has a small part. Edward Woodward, a non-horror actor, is tragic as the man who has fallen in an elaborate trap. And then there is Britt Ekland, beautiful for her time, playing a part that shows off her beauty, and Diane Cilento, who is as cheerful as the rest of Summerisle, with those staring eyes that point at a dark inside. This, precisely, is the heart of the people in Summerisle: zealots who portray a sunny disposition, but who are corrupted at a soul level.",The Wicker Man
76,raulfaust,The innocent man,7,5 October 2011,"I knew the final twist from the get go, since I recently saw 2006's remake. I liked and disliked both, to me they had different good and bad things.Good about this one: original story, nice reflections involving religion, extremely entertaining, well built atmosphere due to the actors' synchrony and doesn't have many clichés. Bad about this one: The atmosphere is too light, I believe it'd be better if they made this dark and creepy. Some things are unbelievable, such as the police officer didn't try to do anything to save his life, not even used his gun-- if he had one. Good about the remake: dark and creepy atmosphere, which doesn't disappoint the spectator once he's expecting it as an horror/thriller. There are only woman in the island, which makes it more plausible for the inhabitants to choose Cage to the sacrifice. Bad things: The plot isn't very entertaining so the film gets annoying after the 40 minutes. Also, Cage is an annoying actor and we feel it's Hollywood in almost every single scene.All in all, both versions of ""The Wicker Man"" are good and deserved to be seen, but none of them are able to be labeled as a classic.",The Wicker Man

While the film is dated & grainy it's still a good watch & a classic all the same.However, I felt the remake had a slightly more dramatic impact. People will probably hate me for saying this, but I didn't really feel it as much in this film as I did in the remake which I felt had a more punchy impact in terms of dramatics than this film did. I found myself having some difficulty trying to connect with this film in terms of the decade & impact. I did want to like it more having heard the things I've heard about this film.The actors were good however, especially the late great Christopher Lee who was great & funny in this film ""I suppose you were getting drunk at your own bar!"" that line was funny.

78,screenman,Weird And Wonderful,8,5 October 2010,"This is a movie that's hard to define.Edward Woodward's policeman is sent to investigate the apparent disappearance of a young girl on some remote Scottish atoll called Summerisle. The community living their is led by a laird of the same name, played by Christopher Lee with his typical larger-than-life relish. Something ain't right.For the most part, the movie is a cross between an almost silly comedy in which Woodward's stiff-necked copper is constantly upstaged by the playful weirdness of the inhabitants. Their lifestyle seems to be an odd mongrel between paganism and Woodstock re-visited. Most of their ideas are utterly shocking to the policeman, who is a Christian churchgoer of the old-school. He is unworldly, inexperienced, a virgin and sullenly proud of it, and extremely uncomfortable with ideas outside of his - very small - box. They are cheerful, happy, and completely indifferent to his investigation. His lordship is equally munificent in his courtesy, and equally dismissive of the case.Britt Eckland plays Willow, the pub landlord's wife, if such a concept exists on Summerisle. She's hot to trot and unsuccessfully attempts to seduce their official lodger. We see her perform a naked dance that brings a whole new dimension to the term 'slap-happy'. (It's not actually Eckland's body we see; a more voluptuous stand-in was used).As the movie proceeds, what little tension there is mounts very slowly - almost too slowly. Sometimes it drags. Whilst throughout the meandering plot, incidental music assumes the sort of folksy froth of a tree-hugger's seminary. There's no clue to what's coming.What's coming is the titular Wicker Man. Our hapless investigator learns too late that he has been slowly inveigled to his own terrible doom.The whole thing hits like a train-wreck after an anorak's convention. You are left to watch the bright sun setting on a day that has just sent our policeman up in smoke.As I say; this is hard to categorise. You make of it what you will. It's completely off the wall. The movie that comes closest in my experience is Clint Eastwood's similarly-vintaged 'Beguiled'. Here, a wounded soldier of the American civil war strays into a secluded girls-school and also comes to a conspiratorial sticky-end.One thing's for sure; you won't forget it!",The Wicker Man
79,JLRMovieReviews,Edward Woodward at His Best,10,25 January 2010,"After hearing Edward Woodward died late last year and hearing that this was his most famous film, I was curious to see it.

Of course, if you're quick, you'll catch all the little things along the way.It concerns a call that the mainland police received about a missing girl on an island off the Scotland coast. Enter Sgt. Howie (Woodward) and his attempt to interrogate the people on the island as to the whereabouts of the girl. For the most part, they are not only uncooperative, but rather amused by his manner and his determination to get to the truth and by certain remarks he makes about his own beliefs.If you've never seen this movie, you should rent it right now.

80,uds3,"As the sun goes down on sanity, the sky glows bright from madness!",10,16 November 2001,"The only reason I have long held THE INNOCENTS to be the greatest horror film ever made is on account of THE WICKER MAN not being a true candidate for this category, rather, a bizarre thriller or suspense generating movie. It remains however well within the top 40 films of all time!So much has been written about the film, both here and in many learned places, I do not propose to re-hash the plot, merely to add my own viewpoint. Some years back CINEFANTASTIQUE devoted an entire publication to this genuinely awesome film, probably the most authoritative work ever compiled on the subject. Those amongst you who share the fascination of this one-off classic should try to locate a copy of this magazine.
Christopher Lee once commented that this was the role of his life and he is correct. He IS Lord Summerisle! For his part, Edward Woodward as the pure and innocent Sergeant Howie, so far out of his depth and yet so rigidly determined to see justice done, must strike a heartfelt chord for anyone who cherishes Christian values (and who would be prepared to back them no matter the odds).Something happened with this film that is curiously indefinable. Perhaps the paganistic May-time songs, the extraordinary images such as the beetle inexorably circling the pin to which it is tethered. The incredible script from Anthony Schaffer, the maypole dance. There are just too many to mention - all part of the larger mosaic. The scene which sears more than any however, is that when Howie crests the hill and confronts the Wicker Man. His look of abject horror as he cries out in fear and desperation, is like nothing I have seen in any other film. You share his mortal terror and funk as surely as if you were in his place. The final scene of the collapsing Wicker Man to the back-drop of the setting sun while the villager chant in that dreadful circle is not something you can forget either. Having your dinner straight after this film would really not sit well would it?The greatness of this uniquely filmed masterpiece is beyond words. You can either SEE it or you can't!

81,frankde-jong,Paganism as an excuse for female nude,5,10 June 2019,"The ""Wicker man"" is a cult classic highly rated by some reviewers that I respect very much.""The Wicker man"" has in interesting story. A police-officer from the mainland goes to a Scottish island in connection with the disappearance of a girl. Initially the local population remains absolutely silent, but after a while the officer supsects a relation with the pagan religion that still reigns on this island.The hostile silence in the local bar at the beginning of the film reminds of ""Strawdogs"" (1971, Sam Peckinpah). The police officer is as much a stranger to the locals as the American professor Sumner in ""Straw dogs"". The idea of a pagan religion still excisting at the edge of Europe (in stead of a voodoo religion in the third world like in ""I walked with a zombie"" (1943, Jacques Tourneur)) is refreshing and contradicting a false sense of Western superiority. For the anthropological aspects of paganism some reviewers refer to ""The golden bough"" (1890, James G. Frazer).There is however one big drawback to the interesting story of ""The Wicker man"". It is mainly used as en excuse to show female nudity (apparantly the old rituals dit not prescribe male nudity). That the '70s sex symbol Britt Ekland is cast in one of the roles is absolutely no coincidence.",The Wicker Man
82,capkronos,Brilliantly realized but not for all tastes,9,12 May 2003,"Edward Woodward (later star of ""The Equalizer"" TV series) is a devoutly religious police inspector who travels to the small island of Summerisle to investigate the disappearance of a young girl. There's a cover up to the girls whereabouts by the entire community and he finds himself equally appalled by their free-living lifestyle...simple pleasures which include drinkin', singin', swingin' sex...and pagan human sacrifice. The title refers to a giant wooden idol necessary for climactic May Day ceremony.THE WICKER MAN opens fairly slowly (and some complain it has too many musical numbers), but after the first pub scene it becomes suspenseful, creepy (without a stitch of violence) and brilliantly atmospheric, creating a seemingly authentic (and unusual) society not dependent on standard moral or religious codes. It's safe to say that the strong and unflinching religious subject matter in this film carries with it the potential to infuriate Christians and Catholics. It's also extremely ironic that this same close-minded worldview is perfectly reflected in the bullheaded lead character, and also helps to seal his fate. Not that the pagans in this film aren't equally unwavering in their beliefs, but the ""power of in numbers"" philosophy rings true here. Imagine a small place in this world NOT adversely affected by standard organized religion and you get the gist of Summerisle.If you want gore, you won't find any here. If you can't go into this film with an open mind, you simply won't appreciate what it has to offer. And if you are looking for a standard horror film you may be disappointed (or you may be like me and be pleasantly surprised). The ending is simultaneously chilling and oddly amusing.

83,chrichtonsworld,Overrated,4,28 July 2007,"After reading many praising reviews I was very motivated to watch The Wicker Man. First I considered watching the remake with Nicolas Cage first. But nobody seemed to be happy with that version and decided to leave that alone for now. So I watched the original and to be honest I am at a loss of words. This movie has to be one of the most overrated movies ever made. If you can even call this a movie. It was more of a musical than a conventional movie about cult traditions. As a true thriller / horror this fails miserably.Be warned this review will contain (mild) spoilers.From the moment Edward Woodward comes to the island it is obvious that something will happen to him. You don't have to be a genius to discover that. He is called to the island in order to find a missing girl. During his investigation he soon finds out that strange things are going on like villagers running around naked, having sex on the beach, pagan rituals, villagers singing songs. And because of this he suspects foul play. After witnessing these strange events you really beginning to expect that the viewer also is being made a fool of. The so called twist isn't a twist but just an ending. Since the result of the event in the end doesn't get revealed. This annoyed me a great deal. What was the point of this movie? To entertain me, to shock me, to educate me on ignorance or other man's religion? This movie is neither thrilling, scary or exciting. I did laugh at some scenes since it was so ridiculous. But overall it was so dull and irritating. Not once does the sergeant call for backup. Maybe he was proud, but he seemed quite intelligent so why didn't he? And if you suspect foul play you are not going to announce that. Certainly not to the people who you can't trust. In this case the whole village couldn't be trusted. It could be that he was blinded by his sense of justice. But even then it is a bit far fetched that he didn't make more of an effort to leave the island to get help. I really tried my best to understand why many reviewers liked this movie. I can only speculate and will keep those thoughts to myself since they can be considered rude. I do think that this movie is really bad. If it wasn't for Edward Woodward, Christopher Lee and some beautiful women I would fall a sleep. I am not a fan of musicals and I already had doubts of combining song and dance with thriller elements. The result is a movie that thanks to strange events and some songs starts out interesting but ultimately fails in surprising the viewer. No matter from what angle you look at it. The real mystery and horror to me is the fact that they have made a remake of this poor movie. Why not make a movie about that thought and process? That would be far more intriguing and interesting than this.",The Wicker Man
84,Maciste_Brother,Interesting film hampered by one massive plot-hole,4,2 September 2003,"Burning Spoilers!I like stories about closed-off societies that the general public know little about and we see how they live by their own rules and customs. I automatically gravitate towards movies with such stories and it's one of the reasons why I watched THE WICKER MAN. Unfortunately, the script is filled with so many plot-holes that I simply couldn't get into it. Of all the many plot-holes, the biggest and the least forgiving one has to do with the police officer and the anonymous letter. You'd think that the character played by Woodward would have WONDERED for one second about who sent the letter and what's the purpose of the letter. But from the get go, the script assumes that the police officer believes the letter is 100% authentic, even after he's being played around here and there on the island by its inhabitants as he's doing his investigation. At one time, Woodward even decides that the girl is not dead but alive and yet he still doesn't question the authenticity or even the reason behind the anonymous letter that got him there in the first place. I mean, come on! After deciding Rowan was still alive and after being played like a puppet, Woodward should have at least questioned the merit of the letter. He should have then tried to find the person responsible for the letter and ask that person the questions that needed to be answered, etc. But no. The letter is just a plot device.Had the script actually dealt with this *massive* and important detail in a right way, I think I would have sorta accepted the film as is but because this deliberate oversight from screenwriter Anthony Shaffer, I just didn't like THE WICKER MAN. To add more goofiness to the whole silly script, Edward Woodward, who overacts shamelessly, comes across as some sort of Dudley Do Wrong. He's so dense and overlooks all the obvious clues that he just looks stupid (the massive plot-hole I've already mentioned doesn't help him much too), and in the end, whatever happens to him, well, he deserves it thoroughly. Because of this, the movie's much vaunted climax is entirely devoid of any shocking, tragic or emotional resonance. Had the police officer actually been written as someone with some sort of intelligence and had the script actually dealt with all the important details it tried to set-up, then the ending would have been amazing.There are other silly plot-holes, like how the folks on the island will explain the police officer's disappearance to the people on the mainland. Or do the extremely isolated people of the island usually send letters to the mainland? Or why is everyone singing? With everyone singing, including a naked Britt Ekland, the movie ends up looking like a musical of sorts. Unfortunately, the kind of music the film has reminded me of the songs in MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL and every time someone started singing, I couldn't help but laugh out loud. Anyway, the idea behind THE WICKER MAN is actually great but the execution is seriously faulty on so many levels that the really cool idea within the story is completely nullified. THE WICKER MAN doesn't work at all.",The Wicker Man
85,inspectors71,I don't know . . .,5,10 September 2021,"If I didn't like The Wicker Man because it was incoherent or because it was a wheezy bit of psychobabble. Heck, I didn't know what to make of Britt Ekland, prancing and tapping about nekked, warbling some strange Celtic lyrics while trying to scissor her bedroom wall. Either I was already bored with the movie in the first 20 minutes--and Britt's boobs couldn't wake me up--or I found all the public humpy/grindy by the villagers in public was an embarrassing turnoff.This is, in Judith Crist's words, ""an old-fashioned movie, and not a good old-fashioned."" Police constable Edward Woodward flies out to an island off the coast of Scotland because he wants to follow up on a missing-child report. Woodward's character, about the thickest copper you could ever hope to hoodwink, can't get over just how weird and kinky the villagers are. He prays and prays and then walks by what must be a dozen couples copulating on the lawn across from the local watering hole. You can almost hear him saying to himself, ""I'm not seeing this, not, not, not!""The scene looks like a birthing class for pregnant couples, way, way too early.As the story unfolds, Woodward gets more frustrated, sweatier, angrier, and begins to smell like a dead rabbit (don't ask). The ending is, well, sort-of predictable, but I did appreciate that Woodward's Christian faith is tested but doesn't break. He is, despite his stolidity, a hero in the true Christians-versus-lions-in-the-Colosseum tradition.What I can't understand is why this movie has such street cred. It's clunky and dull, the main character has the personality of kelp, and Britt Ekland, all cute and perky, is just so much eye-candy. A mannequin with nipples would have sufficed.Go figure.",The Wicker Man

Lee is manic and Woodward is magic. Pure class.",The Wicker Man
87,one9eighty,Intelligent cult classic - relevant still almost 50 years later,8,13 August 2018,"A British cult classic film which uses intelligence, tension and thrills, over a big budget, blood and gore to deliver a haunting vision which leaves something with you.Edward Woodward plays Sergeant Howie, a police man who is sent to a Scottish island village (The Summerisle) to investigate the disappearance of a young girl, Rowan Morrison. Things begin to get strange when the small community deny any knowledge of her; furthermore their own behaviour bemuses Sgt Howie too - some are openly promiscuous, some sing strange songs of life and creation. Although he already suspects it, meeting Lord Summerisle (Christopher Lee) confirms that the inhabitants of the island follow Pagan traditions. Howie must try to uphold the law of a Christian country, deep within Pagan territory, which means working against what the inhabitants of the island see as normal, and he, the law, and Christian religion - see as wrong and immoral. A massive twist at the end of the film promises a memorable and haunting conclusion to the film. The picture shows what can be accomplished with a small budget. The stars of the film are undoubtedly Woodward and Lee who carry this film, probably more so Woodward, as Lee doesn't appear for long periods of time. This is Edward Woodward before his famed role as TV's ""Equalizer"". Christopher Lee appears in this after his stint in a lot of Hammer films, proving that he can do something other than out and out horror roles. The supporting cast didn't really deliver brilliant performances, but in the context of a British 1970's film, they didn't look out of place either. As an example, it seems obvious to me that Britt Ekland isn't there for her acting or singing ability - but other assets, which she finely displays! The film looks lovely and bright; it uses a lot of natural colours of nature which helps the theme of the film somewhat. The music in it is beautiful and haunting at the same time - it's just a pity that the dubbing is obvious for the most part. This is not the only thing which is a little out of place, some of the sequences including flashbacks and random dancing/cavorting aren't done that well, some choppy and some with an overuse of cross-fade, but not enough to make you lose track of what's going on. The pace of the film isn't always easy, and certain parts during the beginning and middle can be a little dull, but as a whole it all works - I just keep telling myself, this film is nearly 50 years old. I just put these down to the film being from the 70's and using techniques of the time - and this film does feel pretty much like a film of its time.
One thing that isn't necessary just of the time; and something that's interesting and relevant to see almost 50 years after the film was released is the religious messages/stance. A lot of the religious conflict in this seems to be apparent in the world today still: two (or more) sides or beliefs banging heads against each other with neither willing to back down, ultimately with somebody suffering. There isn't a right or wrong, it just depends on which side you sit to justify the actions - and in this instance much like real examples - which side has the biggest number of people. This film does that and through following a more typical western point of view of Christianity into a Pagan world it makes the viewer that little bit more alienated, and that little bit more shocked by the end. This is a great film, not the best horror film you'll see, but absolutely one of the best cult films you'll see. It's actually difficult to put this into a genre, many people would argue is horror but it's not, nor is it a thriller, action or detective film. It's a bit of a lot but nothing in specific - but one thing that is absolutely apparent by the end of it, it's clever, intelligent and it's make you think. While the ending has been spoiled over and over again, go into this film with an open mind and you won't be disappointed. 8 out of 10.",The Wicker Man
88,aciessi,Cult Classic.,7,24 March 2020,"Long before Nicholas Cage's career was a twinkle in God's eye, there was the original Wicker Man. The 2006 remake is rife with meme-tactic moments in what could be Cage's most insane role to date. NOT THE BEES! Indeed. But the 1973 film it was based upon does such an incredible job in unsettling it's viewers, it's a wonder that it was ever remade in the first place, let alone poorly. It's touted as one of the scariest films of the 70's. To compare this to a film of late, definitely refer to Midsommar by Ari Aster. A devotedly catholic policy sergeant goes on a mission to find a missing girl in a remote village on an island off the coast of Scotland. This island, unbeknownst to him, is inhabited by a pagan death cult. What starts as a routine investigation turns into a hostage situation as the pagans of the island entrap our protagonist into their web of harmonious chaos, culminating in a virgin sacrifice inside of a male effigy, literally, made out of wicker. I came out of this understanding it as a metaphor for the loss of organized religion and morals in the modern age. I came into it knowing it was a horror classic, but not expecting the large array of original songs. Technically, The Wicker Man could be classified as a musical. Lots of singing, and dancing.. oh, and nudity. The climactic ending is truly and epic feat in psychological horror, and if anything, will make you look at Burning Man a whole lot differently.",The Wicker Man

The wicker man is not really an out-and-out horror though, much more an eerie mystery featuring a fine performance from Woodward, an intriguing premise, and a creepy atmosphere. This is really the type of movie Hammer should have been putting out back in the early 70's, but that's a different matter altogether. Overall, a good film if you're willing to take it somewhat seriously, but not as good as many have claimed by saying that ""it's the best British film ever made"", as that really is going a bit too far.",The Wicker Man
90,TOMASBBloodhound,Eye-opening tale of modern day paganism.,8,20 October 2008,"The Wicker Man is hardly a horror film in the traditional sense of what most people would expect to fit that definition. It is however a terrifically unsettling experience with a stunning conclusion. The film is deeply shrouded in the style and attitudes of pop culture that were prevalent at the time it was made. So much so that much of the music sounds like Simon and Garfunkel type stuff, and the hippie attitudes of the late sixties seem to have been warped to fit pagan beliefs, or vice versa. But whatever the motivations, the finished product is definitely something to behold.Edward Woodward plays a sergeant from Scottland Yard summoned to investigate the apparent murder of a young girl in an isolated island community. Woodward has not even set foot on the land at Summerisle before he suspects the locals have something to hide. Though they are not outwardly hostile, they are hardly helpful with his search. And each step he takes on the island seems to reveal more and more strange behavior. The inhabitants are openly pagan in belief and practice. They make no bones about the fact that Christianity has long since vanished from the island, and now some kind of new-age translation of their old ways has taken roots. Christopher Lee plays the man in charge of it all in a role so delicious, he did it for free.Strange behavior aside, it is obvious that nobody plans on helping Woodward find out what happened to the little girl. At least that's what he's led to believe! Woodward is eventually able to piece together some clues leading him to believe she is still alive and will be sacrificed in a May-day ritual of some sort. He then sets out to search the island from one corner to the next to find the girl and get her out in time. That's his plan, anyway.....To read further would be a grave error if you have not seen this film. The ending was a big surprise for myself, and thankfully I did not read enough about the film to get any hint of the conclusion..... Well, to sum things up, Woodward learns that HE is really the one who will be sacrificed! The girl was never missing. She was just a means of getting Woodward out to the island to be sacrificed. He being a virgin, a servant of the king, and a couple more reasons that I cannot recollect, made him the perfect candidate these pagans were looking for. Since their crops had recently failed, they believed only a proper adult human sacrifice would appease their sun god and bring the crops back. Woodward is placed inside a giant man made of wood, and burned alive along with several animals. The scene was stunning, and for moment I was sure they'd either cop out and tell us it was all a big hoax, or someone or something would come along a save the day for Woodward. Though I felt very bad for his character, thankfully the film never copped out and filmed the ending we see.The Wicker Man is a very good film on many levels. The acting is very good from the main characters. Lee is always a treat, Britt Ekland is particularly stunning, and Woodward is top-drawer. He never really hit it that big in the US, and this is a shame. I've seen the guy in like three films, and he's really talented. Perfect for this policeman role. Breaker Morant is another fine one with him. The hippie music is a little odd, but somehow hypnotic so it ends up actually working. The story is not all that believable, and the final scene may not have been conceived properly in terms of blocking. Honestly, if I were in the cop's shoes, it would have taken one hell of a lot more than one guy to drag me into that contraption. I know, ""but where was he going to run to?"" Still, he would have resisted more than he did. Overall, I'd strongly recommend the film. And by all means try and avoid the remake. By all accounts it is terrible. 8 of 10 stars.The Hound.",The Wicker Man
91,jluis1984,Simply a brilliant thriller!,10,20 January 2007,"Ever since its troubled release back in 1973, director Robin Hardy's ""The Wicker Man"" has been slowly (but constantly) adding new members to its cult following as the film becomes better known, and it's just now that finally the movie is getting the praise it deserves as one of the best films (regardless of genre) ever made. It's hard to believe that this superb example of a mystery and suspense was almost lost, as the financial problems of its production company (British Lion Films) nearly cost Hardy his movie. Fortunately, the film managed to be finished, and while not exactly in the complete version of the director's vision, ""The Wicker Man"" was released theatrically and Hardy's tale of the horrific results of a clash of faiths was able to enchant us with its perfect mix of horror, mystery and suspense.In ""The Wicker Man"", Edward Woodward plays Sergeant Neil Howie, who travels to the remote island of Summerisle after receiving an anonymous letter informing him of the disappearance of a young girl named Rowan. Immediately after his arrival to Summerisle, Howie begins his investigation, but discovers that the locals refuse having met Rowan in the island. Somewhat discouraged by the answers, Howie decides to keep investigating, and soon discovers that the population of the island follow a strange religion with pagan beliefs that are a shock for his conservative Christian faith. As he discovers that Rowan may still be alive (and the villagers plotting her kidnapping), he decides to attempt to rescue her from what he thinks is a barbaric and uncivilized way of life, but he'll discover that there is much more in Summerisle than the case of a kidnapped child.Writer Anthony Shaffer became fascinated by the idea of a modern clash of religions when he attempted to adapt David Pinner's novel ""Ritual"" to film, but while the adaptation failed, the idea became the source for ""The Wicker Man""'s main theme: a confrontation between two extreme sides of religiousness. It's really amazing the way that Shaffer explores this theme through the story, because cleverly avoids to use the archetypes of ""hero"" and ""villian"", and just lets the characters drive the plot towards it's legendary finale. While he cleverly utilizes the missing child plot to question the nature of faith, it's surprisingly never disrespectful, and despite using exaggerated features of both in his characters, the movie is more a cry against blind fanaticism than against a specific religion.Even when Shaffer's brilliant screenplay is one of the film's fundamental elements, the direction by Robin Hardy is what truly makes the whole movie what it is. Despite being under a serious budgetary problem, Hardy managed to bring to life Shaffer's thriller taking advantage of the script's exhaustively researched plot to create a movie that was ambiguously captivating and of a simply otherworldly nature. By blending a natural, semi-documentary visual look with the unforgettable folk score by Paul Giovanni (that updated old traditional songs), Hardy created a joyful atmosphere that despite being cheerful and playful at first sight, becomes increasingly haunting as the plot unfolds. Giving little to no clue about the mystery of the plot, Hardy maintains the suspense always at the maximum level in preparation to a sublime conclusion that has now become a classic.Another of the film's best features are the incredible performance of the members of the cast. Edward Woodward is simply perfect in the difficult role of Sergeant Howie, delivering one of the best performances in the history of the horror genre as the main character of this brutal clash of cultures. The legendary Christopher Lee plays Lord Summerisle, owner and ruler of the island, and one of the movie's most interesting characters. Lee literally becomes Summerisle and fills the role with his natural charm and breathtaking talent. Director Hardy managed to convince Diane Cilento to come out of retirement and play a part in ""The Wicker Man"", adding her experience to the film's assortment of talents. Finally, Britt Ekland plays Willow, a local of Summersile who gets interested in the newly arrived cop. Ekland may not give a performance as amazing as her three co-stars, but she gives the eroticism the movie needs in an unforgettable scene.Sadly, the first thing one notices about ""The Wicker Man"" is how date it looks. While the themes at play are really universal, the movie can't help but look like a product of its time, specifically Great Britain in the 70s. True, this can be a flaw in a way, however, thanks to the style Hardy took on the making of the film (like truly exploring a different culture) make up for this flaw and now give the film the look of a real documentary film (and this of course increases its gritty realism). ""The Wicker Man"" has faced some criticism due to the constant use of songs through the movie, almost to the point of being labeled a pseudo musical film. While this is true to an extent (the songs are really omnipresent), I think that the way they are used fits perfectly the very detailed plot, and adds an enormous amount of realism to Summerisle village and its culture.""The Wicker Man"" may look like another typical thriller with the same kind of mystery and suspense that has been done over and over for a long long time, but it's actually one of the most intelligent and interesting movies ever made. It is a brilliantly written movie that invites its audience to question the nature of heroism and morality, and to witness how far mankind can go for their beliefs. While it really looks dated by now, it's still one of those movies where everything fits in the right place, making the movie as a whole feel like perfect. ""The Wicker Man"" is definitely a must-see, and not only for the horror genre fans. 10/10.",The Wicker Man
92,gab-14712,Shocking Images You Shall Never Forget!,8,11 November 2020,"The Wicker Man is a horror film that will stay with you for ages, if not forever. You will never forget the shocking images, the battle between paganism and Christianity, and that unbelievable ending. Heading into the film, I was expecting something more visceral and bloody. Maybe the trailers for the 2006 ill-conceived remake brought different ideas into my head, but the chills here are more subtle. After the initial disappointment, I was entranced by this British folk horror film. It is an intelligent film that blends together a mixture of genres; horror, thriller, and musical. Yes, you have heard that last part correctly. As someone who studied history and religion, this film spoke measures to me.
In the 1950's and 1960's, actor Christopher Lee appeared in a series of films called Hammer Horror. While he did well in those roles, they were often devoid of much substance and Lee wanted to take on more challenging roles. He got his wish in 1971 when he met with screenwriter, Anthony Shaffer. They decided it would be fun to create a film based on ""old religion."" Shaffer read a book called Ritual and the idea for this project was born. Later, director Robin Hardy joined the film. Everyone had to work quickly to release this film to help the studio, British Lion, avoid bankruptcy.
As almost as famous as this movie itself, is the story of making the film and the adventures since then. One of the most famous, and delightfully disturbing, sequences is the nude song-and-dance by Britt Ekland as she sung ""Willow's Song."" Apparently, Ekland's voice and body image was dubbed for most of the film. While the most famous edition of the film is the brisk, 88-minute one, Hardy original cut had an additional 12 minutes...which was the one he intended to show. However, the prints were thrown away. Many people tried to find it and cobbled together different editions of the film to show the director's original intention. Director's cut or not, the film remains a terrifying tale.
Sergeant Neil Howie (Edward Woodward) is on his way to one of the islands outside Scotland to investigate the disappearance of a twelve-year-old girl, Rowan Morrison. Initially, the folks on the island tells him they do not know of the girl. As he roams the island and gets to know the people more, he increasingly becomes aware that the islanders are aware of the girl. He also sees they practice pagan worship, which differs from his strict Christian morals. He meets with Lord Summerisle (Christopher Lee) where he explains the paganism; the free use of the naked body, procreation before marriage, bonfire jumping, and lots of sex. In fact, the innkeeper's daughter, Willow (Britt Eklund) attempts to seduce him. As the investigation grows deeper, Howie is led to believe that Rowan may have been murdered as a sacrifice for poor crop yield...and the islanders may not be done yet.
Edward Woodward's faithful and bumbling cop carries the film throughout. We get under his skin and mind and of course if you are a strict religious person, you could easily understand the shock as he faces something that truly undermines his religion. And what he does in the final minutes of the film is unbelievable. He was a television actor prior to the film, and he deservedly got some great roles after the film. Lee's character is more complex than the previous monster films he has done. His character is sinister, yet sympathetic. He makes you understand the behavior of his people. Britt Eklund, a horror veteran, will seduce your mind and soul throughout this film so be forewarned.
Without gore and blood, you can see why The Wicker Man is a horrifying feature. Not only that, it is a study of religion. This is the sort of thing you would see during the Middle Ages, so there is a sense of reality. Upon research for the film, The Wicker Man is actually a ritual the Romans had in France to deal with prisoners. The music is very haunting, very folkish. Paul Giovanni used the music to help this feature flow the way it did. The editing is unusual, sharp, and very effective. When the movie was originally released in America, it was widely ignored. It eventually became a cult classic. Whatever you do, do not seek out the remake. Seek this film out instead. It may move along at a slow pace, but unforgettable images will scorch across your mind I promise.

95,Libretio,Weaves a magical spell - but not for everyone...,8,19 February 2005,"THE WICKER MANAspect ratio: 1.85:1Sound format: MonoA deeply religious police sergeant (Edward Woodward, in a note-perfect performance) searches for a missing schoolgirl on a remote Scottish island, where he uncovers a Pagan society rooted in old superstitions and the worship of vengeful gods. First-time director Robin Hardy and acclaimed writer Anthony Shaffer (twin brother of Peter, and author of FRENZY and SLEUTH, the latter based on his stageplay) took aim at organized religion with this unusual entry, which opened at the tail-end of Hammer's Gothic cycle and quickly vanished from sight, only to re-emerge as a favorite of cult movie fans everywhere. To the accompaniment of Paul Giovanni's haunting score - comprising variations on traditional songs and folk music - THE WICKER MAN depicts an isolated community steeped in ancient beliefs and ruled with deceptive benevolence by a patriarchal figure (Christopher Lee, in unusually subtle form) whom the script suggests is a monstrous con man, maintaining the island's customs not through genuine convictions, but because the islanders - all of them true disciples of The Cause - simply know no other way.The central mystery (Woodward's search for the missing girl) is genuinely engrossing, and the bawdy songs which greet the sergeant's arrival are soon replaced by an earthy sensuality as the true extent of the islanders' belief in regenerative powers - divorced from traditional notions of 'morality' - become apparent. Lee's assessment of God verges on blasphemy (""He had His chance and... blew it!""), but ultimately, neither Christianity or Paganism emerges with any credit from the devastating finale. There's real magic in every frame of this extraordinary film, though it's clearly not for everyone: For some, the careful pace and deliberate absence of familiar horror motifs may seem a little long-winded, even dull, though everyone else will be enchanted by this unique, one-of-a-kind movie. Most viewers were introduced to the film via the 88-minute 'theatrical print' - roundly condemned by Hardy and Shaffer - simply because it was the only available version for many years. However, despite the filmmakers' protestations to the contrary, it's still a remarkable experience. The 'definitive' 100-minute version underlines many of Shaffer's themes with greater clarity, making it a revelation for anyone who's only ever seen the theatrical print or the 95-minute variant screened on British television during the 1990's. There's a few bits and pieces in the 88m version which are exclusive to that print, and Woodward's encounter with the doctor in the longer version (39m into the picture) opens a little too abruptly, indicating an apparent loss of footage. Also missing from the 100m print is the animated 'sun-god' which appears after the closing credits in the 95m version, filling the screen before retreating into darkness. The loss of this brief, iconic fragment is inexplicable.",The Wicker Man

In truth it is a low budget confidence trick played out on a audience that is expecting one film and is drawn in to another.This is the kind of film that really should come in to cold. Any prior knowledge - apart from my paragraph above - really damages  the impact. Despite all appearances, our hero is an anti-hero. He is a middle aged prude flung in to a liberal society which likes a bit of sex and nudity and doesn't make any bones about it.The audience is quickly on the side of the villagers rather than the straight-laced Edward Woodward. But slowly, but surely, we get on his side, see his logic, until we have the giant pay-off at the end.(What an end it is - shame that so many people know about it before viewing. I didn't and couldn't stand up for about five minutes.)Christopher Lee has his best film role as the feudal lord and ring leader, although that says more about his anything-if-the-money-is-right choices. We also have Brit Ekland in the undressed (or was it a double?) form of her life.Maybe the film was a happy accident - one of these films where the parts fall in to place almost by themselves?

These are totally at odds with a devout Christian police officer sent from the mainland to the island to investigate a missing young girl.Lee shows in a relatively small part the screen presence that endured him to such an audience. I can't believe this film eluded me for years. A real low budget 'cult' film ticks all the boxes for my film loving tastes.However a couple of thoughts: 1) How did Edward Woodwards police sergeant character have the ability to pilot a plane? 2) Lee has a hippy early seventies hairstyle that only a year later was drastically cut back for his role as Bond villain Scaramanga in The Man With The Golden Gun.",The Wicker Man
98,Seth_Rogue_One,The hills are alive with the sound of madness...,4,31 December 2015,"Some movies age really well, some movies don't.This one falls in the latter category.I saw this movie for the first time today, which is 42 years after it was released, so any nostalgia-factor that it might give to a lot of people is of course out of the window from the gate.I did however see the remake with Nicolas Cage a couple years ago, but don't really remember much about it except for it being truly awful.This movie, is better than the Nicolas Cage movie, I will give it that BUT in reality most movies are so that doesn't count for much.It's a musical more or less, which I didn't expect it to be but there's singing and music-montages every third scene or so that reflects the events or characters in the movie, a lot of the songs have strong sexual themes but with fairly gentle folk-song arrangements.It's also filled with tons of nudity (at least The Final Cut of it that I watched) almost to the point if you wonder if it was a soft-core erotic thriller they were aiming for it to be, but I don't think that was the point.Anyway, the music was actually rather good so I didn't mind that too much, nor did I mind the heavy amount of boobage either but the plot left a lot to be desired, and the ending to me is not bad on paper but it's really poorly executed, there was a lot that could have been done that wasn't for unbeknownst reasons without saying too much.Perhaps when it was new it broke a lot of new grounds but as a first time viewer in 2015 it wasn't all that impressive.",The Wicker Man
99,Son_of_Mansfield,Welcome to Summerisle.,9,6 June 2007,"It's an island of pagans who worship nature and sex. They are ruled by Lord Summerisle, played with effective glee by Christopher Lee. Into this world comes the devout Christian, Captain Howie, played with appropriate horror by Edward Woodward, looking for a missing girl. What he finds is a date with The Wicker Man. This is very hard film to peg. It has horror, comedy, drama, and lots of singing. But it is not easily ignored. If you can make it past the subject matter, I had no problem with that, you will find one of the greatest movies of the last forty years. It deserves a place among such uneasily defined movies as The Rocky Horror Picture Show, Dog Day Afternoon, and A Clockwork Orange.The amazing score by Paul Giavanni is one of the films many wonders. It is full of old fashioned bawdy folk music(Corn Rigs, The Tinker of Rye, and Gently Johnny), ritual songs(Maypole and Chop), and pub songs like The Landlord's Daughter. They can stand on their own, because they are made in a style that is sustained outside of the movie. They are not specifically tied to it, but they make the movie better.The one thing that holds the movie from instant greatness is the title. It's a good title, but the wicker man does not appear until the end of the movie. It is not the essential drive of the movie. Titling it The Wicker Man makes it one of those surprise ending movies, which it is in a way, but it shouldn't be thought of that way. The whole movie is good and it's about the whole movie, which is about the island. Summerisle is a much better title. Nobody is waiting throughout the film for what the wicker man is and the previews would be about the island, rather than giving away the ending. Nonetheless, The Wicker Man is a unique experience that is still fun, alive, and daring, even thirty-four years later.",The Wicker Man

The locals are unhelpful and tell him that she does not exist. Moreover, Howie is dismayed that the islanders have abandoned Christianity for a form of Celtic Paganism. Much of the film's appeal as a horror film comes from its secluded environment. A genuinely creepy feel permeates throughout. The Wicker Man is sometimes referred to as the Citizen Kane of horror movies. I wouldn't go that far, though be aware that The Wicker Man is a properly good film.",The Wicker Man
101,Prichards12345,A film of startling originality,9,2 November 2008,"The story of the making of The Wicker Man is as horrifying as anything in the film itself; British Lion, the company responsible for producing it, underwent a change of management that lead to the film being partly disowned and re-edited as a ""B"" movie in support to Don't Look Now, and after a modestly remunerative run vanished almost without trace in America. It was seen as unmarketable and tales of shady dealings in connection with the movie have filtered through the years to become the stuff of legend. Even poor old Rod Stewart was said to have tried to buy the film so he could destroy the negative - he was supposed to object to the nude scenes of his then girl friend Brit Ekland! That fact that it turned out to be untrue (Stewart didn't even know she was in it!) is all part of the film's fascinating history.The film's original negative is now lost, either inadvertently destroyed or, if you believe the conspiracy theories, buried under the M3 motorway!Ah, yes, the film itself. Anthony Shaffer's screen play introduces us to Sergeant Neil Howie (Edward Woodward), a Scottish police offer who receives a letter from one of the inhabitants of Summerisle, an island in the gulf stream off the west coast, claiming that a young girl has disappeared. Arriving on the island, Howie, a committed Christian, discovers the occupants have reverted to Paganism, re-introduced in the 19th century by the grandfather of the current lord of island (Christopher Lee). And it dawns on Howie that the young girl may have been abducted in preparation for a ritual sacrifice...To go too much into the plot would spoil the film, for it relies on a shift of the viewer's perceptions (not a twist as such)to experience the full genius of The Wicker Man. What we have here is a virtually unique film that dares to be different. It only has a toe in the horror genre, and is at heart a film that examines belief systems (Christianity versus Paganism) and their effect upon the followers of these faiths. Thus the viewers's interpretation of events is often called into question, viewed through the filter of our own beliefs. Once seen it's a film that's impossible to forget.Thanks to the brilliant playing of Edward Woodward Howie never comes across as a prig, but someone who finds the Pagan tradition on the island so totally at odds with his beliefs he can not accept the truth of the situation until it is too late. Christopher Lee also gives a fine performance, and the cast is rounded out by Brit Ekland, Ingrid Pitt and notable British character actors like Aubrey Morris. It's a film of conflict and curiosity, and the ending is as horrifying as anything in cinema. A near masterpiece, only Robin Hardy's rather clumsy direction spoils the proceedings. The story and the theme are all. I refuse to watch the re-make. Why bother when the original is so compelling?",The Wicker Man
102,vostf,Very weak,3,16 January 2007,"How would a movie become so over rated? Surely there's some kind of nostalgia involved for the Wicker Man is deeply rooted in this 60s into 70s period where Old Society collides with Hippie Utopias.Basically the movie is flat: nothing ever comes ahead of the premise. Police officer comes to investigate the disappearance of a young girl in an remote Scottish community. He suspects murder and these people's customs are very strange indeed. No suspense as he goes from rational to grotesque and upsetting discoveries and the copper hero himself is a caricature of the bland emotion-steering British civil servant.On the other hand the local population is rather funny, barely wicked but mostly over-the-top for the discrepancy between abrupt rationality and insidious insanity is too huge for us to feel at ease with either side. The one we would like to root for is of course Christopher Lee who gets a magnificent role that he acts with splendid talent. Unfortunately his character doesn't take over the lead and gets stuck with the rest of the movie in the grand-guignol and would-be-clever ending.On the whole see it only if you're interested in Lee's performance or studying 60s-70s sociology through the movies.",The Wicker Man

104,moviesleuth2,The Weirdest Film I have ever seen,6,26 June 2008,"What the...? For much of the movie, that was the only thing that was going through my mind. I've seen movies about cults and weird religions and so forth, but nothing like this.A police inspector named Sergeant Howie (Edward Woodward) is dispatched to an island of the coast of Scotland to find a missing girl. Once there, he encounters a mysterious populace, all of whom seem to know more about the missing girl than they are sharing.Common knowledge classifies this film as a horror film, but that is a misconception. Apart from the last few mildly chilling minutes, it's not scary, it's just plain weird. Actually, it's more of a mystery. But it's anything but straightforward.The film's construction has a lot to do with the film's success or failure (this really depends on the viewer). Robin Hardy chooses to have Howie serve as a voyeur investigating the people of the island, and while this is never uninteresting, it sometimes causes the story to lose focus.Again, this is not a horror film, at least in the strictest sense. If you're looking for something like ""Halloween"" or, closer to the film's type, ""Les Diaboliques,"" this ain't it. Comparing ""The Wicker Man"" to any of the so-called ""traditional"" horror films is like comparing ""There's Something About Mary"" to ""Monty Python."" That said, even looking at ""The Wicker Man"" as a ""way out there"" film, it still isn't perfect.The film would be more effective had it had a more sympathetic protagonist. Sergeant Howie is supposed to be the ""hero"" of the movie, but he's such a jerk that it's incredibly hard, if not impossible, to sympathize with him.Still, in some strange way I kind of liked this movie. It's never boring, and it has a few effective scenes. Actually, it gets better with after-viewing reflection. Still, I gave it a 6 because I was disappointed that it wasn't very scary.Do I recommend it? It depends on what you're looking for. If you read this whole review and you're still interested, go ahead. If not, skip it.",The Wicker Man

106,dr_foreman,"After twelve years, I finally get it",9,1 July 2004,"I hated ""The Wicker Man"" when I was twelve, but even back then I realized that maybe I just wasn't old enough to get it.  And now?  Now, human sacrifices aside, I think I'd like to live on this film's fictional Summer Isle.  What a groovy place.Oh, and I do like the movie these days.A few crotchety commentators have pointed out some ""plot holes,"" and I think their arguments need debunking.  The cultists were not necessarily counting on Woodward being a virgin; that was a bonus.  Even if he wasn't quite so pure, his status as (a) an adult and (b) a representative of the government would still have made him a good sacrifice, if not ideal.  And I get the feeling that, had Woodward not come through in the end, the cultists really would've burned that girl.But tish and pish to all such concerns, since horror movies are never really supposed to make sense anyway.  The really great thing about this film is its oppressive atmosphere and general freakyness.  I love the wonderful folk music, the passive-aggressive townsfolk, the eerie animal masks, the drawn out sacrifice segment; it's all so ballsy, when you consider that the average movie plays it so much safer by comparison.  And of course, the contrast between the island's idyllic appearance and the sinister goings-on there works really well.This is a cult classic that deserves its status.  You can sneer if you like, but horror really doesn't get much better written than this.",The Wicker Man
107,LoneWolfAndCub,A very unique horror/mystery,10,30 March 2007,"Robin Hardy has created a very different kind of horror. The Wicker Man is not a slasher, an exploitation flick, a ghost story, a werewolf film, etc. It is a blend of horror, mystery and religion with a touch of drama. After watching I thought it best to break the plot in two halves. The first half plays like a mystery, Sergeant Howie (Edward Woodward) is sent a mysterious letter asking him to locate a missing girl, Rowan Morrison, who lives on Summerisle. Throughout the first 50 minutes we are lead to believe many things about this girl but which ones are the truth? This is what makes The Wicker Man such a brilliant movie. The director never really settles on any idea or mood and as we see religious rituals and meet Lord Summerisle (an amazing performance by Christopher Lee) we know there is something quite sinister under it all.From the 50 minute mark, though, the movie slowly grows into a full blown horror which still manages to shock this very day. The great thing about it though, is the fact that Hardy decides to draw it out so our suspense levels are at the point where we are gripping the couch, just awaiting what is to be inevitable. And when it comes it hits like a hammer, it is shocking but done in a way so that it is not cheap or exploitive.The Wicker Man is horror at its best. There is no violence, no cheap shocks, bad acting or predictable music. Edward Woodward and Christopher Lee are both excellent in their roles. One a devout Christian cop and one the head of a Pagan community. An enchanting soundtrack is used marvelously in The Wicker Man which seems to lure the viewer into a false sense of security. Despite the thought of sinister goings on in the community , there is a certain light, playful feeling that is brought about by the elegant soundtrack making it quite hard to actually believe there any evil events occurring.Although this is not pure horror, it is easily one of the greatest (horror) movies of all time. Well-acted, great soundtrack, captivating direction and the best ending to a film ever put onto celluloid.5/5",The Wicker Man
108,asda-man,Terrifying burner,9,29 January 2012,"I think it's important to note that, given this to me a few years ago, when I first saw this film, I would not be sitting here giving it a 5 star review. Instead I'd probably sitting here giving it 2 or 3 stars and telling you about all the things I really didn't like about it. But as weeks and months passed by I couldn't get ""The Wicker Man"" out of my head, and I started to realise that actually it was a pretty incredible and rare horror film, that focuses its attention on unsettling imagery rather than cheap gory kills. Watching it again recently for the second time only confirms my new beliefs that ""The Wicker Man"" is a masterpiece and a well-deserved classic.It's a slow burner with an extremely, increasingly intriguing mystery surrounding a missing girl. From the minute Edward Woodward steps onto the island it's obvious that something isn't right with these people, and they're hiding something, though you're not entirely sure why. It's a film about encounters really, that don't make any sense, and are so unnatural that they turn out to actually be quite frightening. ""The Wicker Man"" has a very imaginative and solid screenplay, that clearly has had a lot of thought being put into it, with its creepy religious symbolism and ultimately shocking finale.Edward Woodward is the only normal man we see throughout the whole film, and like ""Shutter Island"" he can't leave, and so their is a great atmosphere of claustrophobia and also a coldness from the awe-inspiring scenery. The songs are also unsettling, if not a bit overlong, they seem to be cheery and well-practised, just something very unnatural about it all. ""The Wicker Man"" also has some fantastic iconic moments, not just the final scene, but throughout their seems to be moments that will always stay with you.Christopher Lee does a find job, also dawning an hilarious wig resembling a mild Patsy from ""Absolutely Fabulous"". He also has some classic lines and will probably be one of the most memorable characters of all time. In my opinion ""The Wicker Man"" was way ahead of its time, and the ending is no exception. When we meet ""The Wicker Man"" a sheet of sheer terror certainly does cover you. It is monstrously creepy, and will probably stay with me for as long as live. Unless I get Alzheimer's and forget EVERYTHING! ""The Wicker Man"" is an essential horror classic. You might not appreciate the first time, but as time goes on, you won't be able to put away that image of ""The Wicker Man"" which ultimately leads up to what probably is the best twist and finale to any film in history. It's the definition of chilling, and also you feel a lot of sympathy. Everything about it is unsettling and gripping. This is true horror.",The Wicker Man
109,Nightman85,An image forever burned into the cinematic minds.,10,11 May 2006,"An intelligent, suspenseful, and alluring modern classic, The Wicker Man remains one of the most unforgettable thrillers of it's day.Scottish policeman arrives on an off-shore island to investigate the disappearance of a girl and discovers that the mysterious islanders are all part of a pagan cult. That's only the beginning of horrors to come.The Wicker Man is a rare kind of film that develops a strange world of its own and exists only within that world. The culture that is presented in this film has a very realistic feel to it, thanks largely to Robin Hardys sharp direction and to Giovanni's oddly soothing musical score. The setting of the film is beautiful and lush, and very well exposed for our story. The cinematography is often stunning. Some sequences of the film are actually quite hypnotic! Story-wise The Wicker Man is excellent as well. Anthony Shaffer delivers a well-written mystery with a strong sense of both the eerie and erotic. It is a tale that builds with dread and tension till the horribly unsettling conclusion - which ends with the most arresting images of the film.The cast is quite excellent, the best of course being leads Edward Woodward and the great Christopher Lee. The characters of the film are very believably played, which strengthens the authentic feel of the movie all the more.A classic in every way, The Wicker Man is one of those films that never loses its power to chill and intrigue.

110,nickenchuggets,A quaint island full of pagans,9,28 May 2021,"I've known about this movie for a long time, but have put off watching it for almost as long. I suppose the horrendous remake starring Nicholas Cage ruined my perception of it, but it's best to pretend that that movie never existed, much like the supposed missing girl in this movie. The film is about a policeman from the UK who is sent to a strange island off the coast of Scotland to look into the disappearance of a girl named Rowan. Soon after arriving, he is sickened to find out that the people on the island practice all these grotesque and unusual acts in order to worship their pagan gods. Sergeant Howie digs deeper into the mystery of the strange island and finds out the locals are lying about the young girl when they say she isn't real. Her existence must be kept a secret because she is apparently going to be sacrificed in some strange ritual that takes place every May. Little does Howie realize though, the girl is not the real sacrifice. He is. The islanders choose him because he came there without being invited first and is foolish. After Howie tells the leader of the Island, Lord Summerisle, that killing him won't save their harvest, he is placed inside a giant Wicker Man effigy and burned horribly to death. The ending of this movie is probably one of the most disturbing I've ever seen, and it really shows how pagan beliefs can be savage when zealots make the rules. Woodward as the police sergeant is great, and throughout the movie you can sense his frustration (and later fear) as he is lied to constantly by the islanders. Christopher Lee also plays the leader of the island, and that alone makes it worthwhile. A definitive pagan movie for sure, but also has a musical element to it.",The Wicker Man
111,Ali_John_Catterall,The Landlord's Daughter,10,19 November 2009,"Three iconic horrors were made in 1973: The Exorcist, Don't Look Now – and The Wicker Man, in which Edward Woodward's Christian copper investigates the disappearance of a missing girl in a remote pagan community. Unlike the first two films, Robin Hardy's debut was originally mishandled and overlooked, only belatedly recognised as a brilliant original years later. Christopher Lee still refers to it as his greatest film role, while the exceptional score continues to inspire new generations of folk new wavers. Brimming with eroticism, haunted atmospherics and authentic pagan idolatry, it retains its bewitching power all the way to the horrifying finale.The other thing about the Wicker Man, is Britt Ekland. For a great number of young, British hetero men growing up in the 1980s, forbidden fruit came courtesy of two very impressionable, unforgettable sources: the well-bookmarked novels of horror writer James Herbert, with their unique descriptions of ritual and romance (all ""secret softnesses"" and ""moist forests"" being plunged into) - and Ekland in The Wicker Man.For those whose previous experience of girls cavorting round their bedrooms was confined to watching their sisters wig out to Altered Images, the vision of innkeeper's daughter Willow McGregor getting her kit off, shaking her jelly, and hammering lustily on the dividing walls, will have seared itself like an atomic-flash on the eyeballs for eternity.

113,rdoyle29,A rarely seen cult gem,10,9 October 2000,"""The Wicker Man"" is a subversive, double-edged fable about the attractions and terrors of the primitive and ritualistic.  It simultaneously criticizes and endorses the hedonism of the 1960s in a gleefully ironic fashion. Howie, supposed hero and only representative of decent, conventional society, is a dim, guilt-ridden figure while the islanders, initially presented as suspicious, menacing rustics, led by the suave, charming Lord Summerisle, are a liberated, fun-loving community, determined to protect their way of life.  The movie is blatant in the presentation of their obsession with procreation, rejection of traditional Western taboos about sexuality, and worship of nature.  Summerisle is a clean, brightly lit place, that comibines edenic innocence with hidden threat, and, depending upon your point of view, is either devoid of evil or its evil is concealed under a seductive surface.  The sense of a world ruled by ritual and in tune with nature is underlined by the constant use of folk music rather than the menacing scores associated with horror films.The movie belongs to two traditions - films of witchcraft and paranoid thrillers about city folk who find themselves the victims of rural plotters and conspirators.  It is imperfect, and at times overplayed.  Some of its appeal comes from its troubled history.  It became an instant hit among a small group of horror fans when it was released with 16 minutes cut by British Lion, a company undergoing a change of management and whose executives disliked the picture.  It went into distribution as a supporting feature with ""Don't Look Now"", a truly sensational double-bill.  There are thematic similarities and a close resemblance between Howie's pursuit of the fleeing dragon-headed hobby horse and Donald Sutherland's pursuit of the red-coated dwarf through the Venetian canals.  Because it wasn't given a press screening or advertised much, ""The Wicker Man""'s reputation spread mostly by word of mouth.",The Wicker Man

Brought to the island of Summerisle by an anonymous letter, Edward Woodward's constable is surprised to discover that the island's population suspiciously denies the missing girl's very existence. Even more shocking, at least to the traditionally pious law office, the island is ruled by a libertarian society organized around pagan rituals. Repelled by the open acceptance of sexuality, nature worship, and even witchcraft, the officer takes an antagonistic attitude towards the people and their leader, an eccentric but charming English lord (Christopher Lee). The officer's unease intensifies as he continues his investigation, slowly coming to fear that the girl's disappearance may be linked in a particularly horrifying manner to an upcoming public festival. Anthony Shaffer's meticulously crafted screenplay creates a thoroughly convincing alternative society, building tension through slow discovery and indirect suggestion and making the terrifying climax all the more effective. Performances are also perfectly tuned, with Woodward suitably priggish as the investigator and horror icon Lee delivering one of his most accomplished performances as Lord Summerisle. Little noticed during its original theatrical run due to studio edits and a limited release, the film's intelligence and uncanny tone has since attracted a devoted cult following.",The Wicker Man

It isn't really a horror film, or a murder mystery or even a black comedy, but contains elements of all three. This is, however, one of the most clever films I have ever seen.Devoutly religious police officer Neil Howie arrives on Summerisle seeking a missing child, a little girl named Rowan. He finds a community virtually cut off from the rest of the world who have reverted to a pagan lifestyle. Howie is quite shocked and morally outraged to see women dancing naked in the fields around bonfires, couples having sex right out in the open where anyone can see, grade school teachers instructing the class in fertility lore and herbalists healing with frogs. He is also sorely tempted by Willow, the Innkeepers daughter played by Britt Ekland, who tries to lure Howie into her bedroom with a song and a naked dance. Of course, he resists. Everyone seems quite amused by his piousness and not very concerned with the disappearance of Rowan. When he finds a hare buried in Rowan's grave, the angry Howie confronts Lord Summerisle, played with perfection by Christopher Lee in one of his favorite roles. Slowly, Howie comes to learn the truth; a virgin is needed for a sacrifice due, and the virgin in question may be Rowan...or it may not be.There's only one word for this film: stunning. There are no clichés here, no standard film formulas. This is so original that I truly did not see what should have been the obvious plot twist coming, and was quite surprised and shocked by the unforgettable ending. The cast is absolutely flawless, the visuals are impressive and haunting and the film is filled with lovely folk music throughout.

He has received a letter about a missing girl, but on arrival gets no help from the islanders, who hinder and mislead him, whilst his extreme, almost puritanical Christianity collides with the pagan practices enforced by the island's leader, the mysterious Lord Summerisle (Christopher Lee), leading to a terrifying conclusion...The film is very eerily shot, with some great use of music, much of it actually sung or performed on camera. The location shots of the Scottish Highland scenery, with it's houses, mountains and countryside add a very ethereal quality to the movie. The resulting atmosphere is one of almost jollified menace and this continuous right to the famous ending, with the islanders singing joyously as the wicker man goes up in flames.Some terrific performances abound here. Edward Woodward is spot-on as the continually perplexed and outraged policeman. Christopher Lee really enjoys his role as Lord Summerisle. Britt Ekland is alluring as the seductive Willow while the rest of the cast affect a well-realised veneer of sinister normality.The plot works very well in spite of one or two contrivances - in particular the scene where Howie is tricked into dressing up as Punch - and the famous ending works on two levels - the final nasty surprise which snares Howie in the Wicker Man and the hint that islanders actions will be to their own undoing as much as they prove to be Howie's.For those interested, it is worth reading up on the many articles written about the ideological struggle in ""The Wicker Man"", as the movie acts as a microcosm for many similar and more destructive struggles taking place in the world today.Provocative and powerful, ""The Wicker Man"" especially now is a film that needs to be seen.",The Wicker Man

⚪
All in all, this seventies classic ignites a bizarrely unsettling mystery and explores the deepest abysses of religious beliefs and values, and while it isn't graphic at all, the imagery, the symbolism and the overall writing make it an intelligently disturbing, subtly unnerving, thought provoking essay on fanaticism and conviction of mankind, a film that is the closest we can get to real life horror and while it is a slow burner in the beginning, it literally burns like hell in the end.

For day five I picked a British classic and one of the most popular non-Dracula Christopher Lee films, and a title that has been on my watchlist for a very long time. My father loves it a lot and was the one who inspired me to buy this version that includes all three existing versions, and of course, I started with the cinematic cut. I have only heard things about it before and didn't know what to expect from it, because it was mostly mentioned in the same context as Ari Aster's modern psychological terror fest ""Midsommar"" that has drawn a lot of inspiration from this movie here, and that is as twisted as this one. While I famously wasn't that thrilled by Aster's work, this one here really fascinated me on a mysterious level. On the surface, it seems to be a crime thriller about a mainland police officer who sets out to investigate the vanishing of a little girl on a secluded island, but the more time passes, the more the secrets unfold and reveal a disturbing truth. This film here is anything but ordinary and definitely not suitable for the average moviegoer, because aside from its original premise that indicates a crime thriller, it also combines many different other genres at the same time. When the islanders break out into song multiple times, it becomes a musical or when said people watch our protagonist from the distant while wearing disturbing animal masks, it has a strong horror film feeling as well. Whatever you call it, it is effective, at least for me. If you look for blood, gore or jump scares, you are at the wrong address with this film, because the tension is solely created by its subtle and mostly unnoticeable, small details that only contribute to the grotesque ending. It is full of sexual innuendos and similar symbolism and constantly juxtaposes natural religion and Christianity, as well as their respective rites and customs. The iconic and unforeseen ending is only the jaw-dropping climax of the whole psychological horror the film creates. ""What horror?"", you may ask, and I am going to show you what I mean. As already mentioned, the film is not graphic at all. The only thing that makes you feel extremely uncomfortable is those people living out their strange believes and customs, because what is there in the world more creepy than religious fanatics sacrificing everyone and everything in order to please their gods? This is the closest we get to real life horror, and I totally dig it. Of course, it still isn't perfect, mostly because protagonist Sergeant Howie isn't quite the most likable character and Lee's Lord Summerisle is underused (at least in this version), but it still has something intriguing that grabbed me the entire time. In the end, it definitely is a classic that convinces with its uncommon concept and atmosphere, and singlehandedly created a whole new subgenre of horror. You should have watched it at least once, if you consider yourself a horror film fan. I am pretty sure the other versions will improve this one here a lot.",The Wicker Man
120,SMK-4,Questioning your belief system,10,3 February 1999,"It is somewhat strange that some of the best British films of all time are not very well known outside movie-buff-dom.  The Wicker Man is certainly one of them (another is Get Carter).The Wicker Man is not just technically very well made, with an excellent cast, a glorious cinematography and a gripping script, it goes beyond that. It is one of those rare treats that manage to question your belief system. It lures you into a foreign system of beliefs, it seduces you into sympathising with an act that is - legally speaking - a murder.It is impossible to categorize the film into a genre.  Some have described it as a horror film, which in a strict sense is completely wrong as there are no shock elements here, no gore whatsoever, and just one killing; but in a more relaxed sense this is not such a bad characterisation after all, because the film uses the language of horror films, e.g. permanently hinting at that something mysterious and horrific is going on.  Similarly flawed are characterisations as a fantasy film (nothing supernatural) or sci-fi (no science), but the film takes a little bit each from the flavour of these genres.",The Wicker Man
121,GeorgeRoots,Stunning Cult Movie About A Crazy Cult.,10,25 July 2014,"""The Wicker Man"" has been widely regarded as the ""Citizen Kane"" (1941) of Horror movies. I guess Robin Hardy can be extraordinarily flattered knowing that this piece will continue to age and remain relevant, especially as a social commentary of sorts.A horror that isn't really bloody. Police Sergeant Howie (Edward Woodward), is sent to a remote island in search for missing girl Rowan Morrison. From the start it doesn't help that the locals are abrasive and lack any information, soon after the devout Christian realises he is surrounded by a community of Pagans. Ultimately leading to a hopeless climax, wherein logic is irrelevant and your fate on the island is ultimately sealed.Woodward's portrayal is timeless regardless how successful ""The Equalizer"" was, and Christopher Lee as Zealot Lord Summerisle is outstanding. Apparently it still remains Lee's favourite role but even after having more than 250 credits to his name, the man continues to have such a unique commanding presence in every picture. Unfortunately, too many of my peers now regard this film ""silly"", and the 2006 ""remake"" has only gone on to cement the absurdity of such a story. But I believe that ""The Wicker Man"", will continue to have influence for a very long time. I love how isolated from the outside world it remains and how futile Howie's investigation is, yet he bravely soldiers on in the face of animosity.All that remains to say is that the Scottish countryside is beautifully shot, and the eerie folk music build incredible tension. The mystery is revealed by the end and while it's nothing incredibly clever, the motives make sense to no one but the people who concocted it. The final moments are so wonderfully choreographed they end the movie as if it were a stage production.Final Verdict: A fantastic picture that ends in utter despair. 10/10. Classic British picture.",The Wicker Man

I wish they would have shown more of Ingrid Pitt.  (Read into that whatever you want.)  Christopher Lee was effective with an odd hair style and as the lead baddy.

124,kijii,Stranger in a Strange Land,10,12 November 2016,"The Wiker Man is number 96 on the BFI's Top 100 movies.---------------------------------Sergeant Neil Howie (Edward Woodward), of the fictitious West Highlands Constabulary, is sent an anonymous letter recommending that he investigate the disappearance of a young girl, Rowan Morrison, on the remote Hebridean island of Summerisle. He flies out to the island and during his investigations discovers that the entire population follows a neo-pagan cult under the island's owner Lord Summerisle (Christopher Lee), believing in re-incarnation, worshiping the sun and engaging in fertility rituals and sexual magic in order to appease immanent natural forces. Howie, an extremely devout and conservative Christian, is increasingly shocked by the islanders' behavior; yet, he is attracted and repulsed by the alluring and sexual Willow (Britt Ekland), the landlord's daughter. He receives no assistance in his search from the islanders, who initially deny Morrison exists and then say that she recently died. Howie persists and uncovers evidence suggesting the girl was a victim, or perhaps is soon to be a victim, of human sacrifice. Delving deeper into the island's culture, he disguises himself as Punch, a principal character of the May Day festival, to uncover the details of the ceremony ---Summary from Wikipedia--------------------------------------- This is a great example of what I call the ""stranger-in-a-strange land"" movie genre. While Howie, who is as 'male virgin' and a devote Christian, may deplore the pagan religion of these strange island people, he has a hard time justifying why his religion is more rational than theirs. For example, after witnessing young virgin girls forming a circle and jumping over a fire naked, he asks Lord Summerisle why he allow such immoral behavior on his island. Lord Summerisle explains that the girls are enjoying their divinity lessons representing parthenogenesis—reproduction without sexual union.Howie explodes, ""What ever is this? I mean you've got fake biology, fake religion. Sir, have these children never heard of Jesus?""..""Himself the son of virgin impregnated by a ghost"" Lords Summerisle interrupts, implying 'is OUR religion any less rational than YOURS?This story challenges modern traditional beliefs, with the music, dances, costumes and customs of the island hearkening back to an older time before Christianity replaced Gaelic paganism. The movie is not only challenging and unsettling but leaves us with an unforgettable ending.",The Wicker Man

126,loomis78-815-989034,Absolute Shocker.,9,3 August 2014,"This review is based on the American Theatrical release of this film. Sgt. Neill Howie (Woodward) is a policeman from the mainland who is called to a small island off the west coast of Scotland called Summerisle to investigate the disappearance of a 12 year old girl. The Sergeant is immediately taken back by the strange people on the island. They lie to him at every turn and there is a general lack of Christian morality everywhere he looks. On his first night he is tempted by the Inn's sexy daughter (Ekland) who dances nude on the other side of the wall to entice him to join her. Sgt. Howie is an upstanding Christian who is still a virgin so he is able to fight off the temptation. Even though he has jurisdiction on the island, no one is willing to help him find the missing girl. He is eventually brought to meet Lord Summerisle (Lee) who informs the sergeant that the girl is dead. He further shocks the Sergeant by telling him the Island and its people worship the Gods of nature are all Pagans. He is urged to leave their Island before their May Day celebration the next day. Sgt. Howie attends the ceremony in disguise, believing that the missing girl is still alive and is going to be sacrificed. *Spoiler Alert* He actually finds the girl alive only to realize that he is the one the cult wanted all along. He is brought to a hillside where a giant wooden wicker man is waiting for him. Along with animals, he is to be burned alive as a sacrifice. All though highly rooted in its era of the early 1970's, this British film is a well-crafted chiller that has one of the best Horror twist endings of all time. With its history of poor distribution and Christopher Lee saying this is one of his favorite roles; The Wicker Man has achieved true cult status. The film doesn't scare you with jumps or shocks. Instead it weaves a tone of creepiness from the beginning until the horrifying and shocking conclusion which stays with you long after it's over. Enough cannot be said about the lead performance by Edward Woodward. A lesser performance could have made this film unravel, but you never doubt the believability of this character, and Woodward should get the praise for this. Director Robin Hardy, working from a script by Anthony Shaffer, puts the audience behind the eyes of the lead character. We're trying to figure out the strange Island and its people just like Sgt. Howie is. It's obvious something sinister is at work and we experience the film from his perspective which is one of the strengths of the film. Britt Ekland's nude dance is erotic and memorable, and the many odd scenes this film has stacks up to make a scary and memorable Horror film.",The Wicker Man
127,the amorphousmachine,"Not your typical edge-of-your-seat horror/thriller, but a compelling mystery that proves that horror can be found in unravelling it!",8,17 July 2005,"(Some spoilers, or hints at spoilers) Despite a rather flawed premise in which a solo Sergeant named Howie (Edward Woodward, '""Breaker"" Morant') investigates a missing girl in an island community somewhere near Scotland, 'The Wicker Man' proves to be compelling viewing. One could argue that his precinct was short staffed, and his lone Detective status was natural given the circumstances. However, usually I believe more than one Police Officer will investigate a disappearance of a girl, especially if it's within a remote community and unfamiliar territory! Regardless, Edward Woodward's uptight extremely Christian Sergeant is quite a contrast to the community he explores, and he soon finds himself at odds with their religious Pagan practises, and how the community is raising the children of the island, as he searches for the missing girl.Christopher Lee plays Lord Summerisle, the leader of the community, and deceivingly helpful host in Howie's search. It seems the entire community are constantly lying to this would-be Detective, but as the story unfolds, you might be able to click what is exactly going on up until its rather terrifying conclusion. Christopher Lee has his familiar trademark presence, but it was Edward Woodward who really made this film for me. His performance is exactly in this strange film that borders on a musical/thriller/hippy film that explores cults, and I found myself really rooting for his character- who in reality was the underdog, as he holds to true to his beliefs and the law he works for. 'The Wicker Man' is not your typical thriller/horror movie (several musical numbers will see to that), and you can see the 1970s look and influence within this film. However, 'The Wicker Man' proves you don't need heaps of blood and gore to show horror, and debut director Robin Hardy shows us a good job of that through Howie's eyes-- as the community Howie explores unravels, and as our isolated hero becomes more disturbingly isolated throughout the story! 'The Wicker Man's' themes, issues and conclusion will ultimately garner a response from its audience, and Anthony Shaffer's story is good enough to keep the viewer interested. Overall, I thought it was really good, and while I can't say I liked the ending, it was perfectly disturbing enough given the content and direction of the film! Oh, and a very weird...but a very attractive Britt Ekland is in it too! **** out of *****!",The Wicker Man
128,Jacques98,Simply not that effective today.,7,20 January 2009,"I hear the whole ""Old horror movies were scary, new horror movies are just gore-fests!"" argument so often that I'm pretty much desensitized to the utter stupidity of it. For one, people said Night of the Living Dead (1968) was just as excessively gory in its time as people say Saw IV (2007) is excessively gory today. There is just as much sex/nudity in The Wicker Man (1973) as in Hostel (2005), if not more. New or old, movies pushed the level of shock value in their respective generationsthat has never changed. Being someone who's seen a large amount of older horror films, I can say firsthand that the majority of them are pure laugh-out-loud cheese horror, and their fans are blinded by nostalgia. I can count the amount of horror movies that have genuinely frightened me on one hand, and not a single one them was over 15-years-old. You're reading the review of a horror fan that has actually grown up and matured with the times. Not a horror fan that is stuck with old horror movies the same way a teenager is stuck with the blanket he's had since early childhood. I realize that modern horror films don't just dibble around with cheesy monsters and ghosts; they add realism and true emotion. Am I saying everything from the 2000s has been gold? Ha! Read my reviews and you'll see I hate 95% of it. But that doesn't make old horror movies superior, because they're just as bad for their own reasons. Namely cheese. But despite everything I just said, The Wicker Man was one of the few moviesmodern or agedthat is genuinely deserving of the hype behind it. Mostly.I'll start with the things The Wicker Man got right. While the movie was not absolutely terrifying by any means, I agree with the reviews that state there is a level of apprehension that is prevalent from open to close. The atmosphere is not perfect, but it is slightly better than average. The entire film carries a surrealism feel, but it isn't really surrealism. The use of colors is very neat to watch. I put the art direction far above that of Suspiria (1977), simply because it's a lot less over-the-top and cheesy. The acting and direction are both fairly well-done for its time. The Wicker Man, for the most part, avoids everything that made the other movies from its time so cheesy and laughable.The story is very well played out, even if it is a little thin. There is a definitive mystery behind it, and it's pretty immersive, for the most part. I'm someone who is easily bored with movies, but this held my attention to the endmostly. There are a lot of repetitious scenes that had no point, but the atmosphere and color-work made up for it.The director seemed to be inserting some idea about religious extremists on both sides of the spectrum, but I really failed to see his point. I give him props for not bashing us over the head with a cliché moral, however, and that is where The Wicker Man really becomes superior to other films like it.Now the things The Wicker Man failed at. Above everything else, as interesting as the story is, there just isn't enough here to stretch out for that long of a time. It's a single-line plot with no subplots, and when it finally reaches the end, the only thing I really thought was: ""Well . . . that was pretty cute."" Why? Because it played out a like a children's fable, and lacked any maturity of an adult piece. Get rid of the nudity and it could pass as an Alice in Wonderland wannabe. Maybe that assessment is a little too harsh, but that's really what I thought directly when it was over. It all plays out way too tritely for me to take seriously. All the answers to the main character's questions just fall in his lap with no effort from him whatsoever. He just stands there and people tell him what he wants to know. It's really sad to see such great atmosphere go to waste due to poor, childish storytelling.Overall, though, I really liked The Wicker Man for what it was. It was a cute morality tale with some nice visuals. But it's ludicrous for people to state this as the most terrifying movie of all time, or even one of them. It has a dull sense of dread, but I'd hardly call that true terror. It has some memorable scenes, but I'd hardly call it a masterpiece because of them. It borders a lot on take-it-or-leave-it, but I'm going to say this. If you're a modern horror fan who thinks everything from the past is cheese, check this out. It may challenge your opinion on the subject. If you're a horror fan stuck in the past, just get over this movie. It's not THAT special.4/10",The Wicker Man

130,jaibo,illuminating,9,6 July 2002,"Here is an allegorical revelation of the way in which the illuminati has mind-controlled the populations of Western Countries over the last few centuries, killing the spirit of revolutionary Puritan spirituality and numbing the minds of people so that their only obsessions are bovine sex and child-rearing and their only use is to produce products (""fruit"" in the film) for the profit of their exploiters (Christopher Lee's Lord Summerisle). My evidence that the film is an expose of the Illuminati? The small rowing boat which takes Edward Woodward's policeman Neale Howie from his plane to the Island has, painted on its side, a single eye - the famous illuminati symbol. The island itself works as a metaphor for our modern environment: everywhere one looks there are the marks of paganism and the old gods. Perhaps the arrival of Howie in a plane shows his (humanity's) descent into a lower state of consciousness, one which must ultimately lead to human sacrifice (the final symbol of the Wicker Man itself standing for all the wars, torture and atrocities which have risen from the human form in Capitalist/Materialist society). The name - Neale Howie - may be telling us that here is a man who can have the humility (he knows how to kneel) to look up to a higher state of human/divine consciousness (Christ), rather than being tied to unregenerate nature, as the islanders under Summerisle's rule are.   The way in which sex and conformism (i.e. having babies) is indoctrinated into the children at their school mirrors the relentless way in which our wider culture drums these same things into the poor plebian population. Perhaps the most extraordinary sequence has Howie - unable to get his plane to take off again - follows the constantly vanishing Hobby Horse around the island's twisting alleys. Surely there is no more poignant and sinister portrayal of the human tendency to follow vanishing whisps (each of us has our own special ones, our ""hobby horses"") which take us nowhere but to ignominious doom.   The death of the king of fools in the end shows us how the side of us which desires justice, higher consciousness and meaningful relationships (true romance) is forever roasted before the heathen gods of produce and natural phenomena.

Tonal spoilers, maybe.",10,2 January 2002,"On a second viewing, indeed a viewing of the billed ""director's cut"" of this film, I can put forward the view, without a zesty quibble, that it's a wonderful film. It is possible, indeed, somewhat... likely that convinced Christians may shirk at some stage, may claim the film is a hatchet job on fundamentalist Christians such as one Sgt. Neil Howie. Anthony Shaffer's script for this film seems to be quite an achievement. He manages to maintain an ambiguity (well, if one ignores the implicit) in his authorial tone towards the Pagan and Christian faiths and viewpoints that leave the film open to innumerable countenances. While even this 100 or so minute cut of the film proves a veritable collaboration of disparate elements - the musical, the suspense thriller, the billowing black comedy, the sexual rumination... it does merge to the effect of a tumbling orchestra : an epiphany of appropriate ambiguity and dark mirth, at least at its close.Woodward's Howie is perfectly pitched; a closed-minded, indignant innocent, pray to a broader scheme. His downfall seems ignoble, his portrayal is as a pathetic little man unwilling to the nth degree to countenance the ways of Summerisle : Howie is far from a hero, with whom a prospective audience can identify. The pathetic nature of the character is not without pathos, however, as the conclusion plies its spell. The film is a delectable inspiration of macabre delights : from the insidious, nigh-on knowing connivance of the villagers to befuddle the hapless Howie, to the arch, fitting symbolism drenching many a frame, to the ""decor minimaliste"" of the ladies... it's a film languourously intent on a precise purpose; questioning the viewer's imposed repose - putting forth the implication that Christianity is merely righteous chicanery. I am well won over, to a degree, to the island's side, as opposed to the self-confident, staid Howie. The portrayal of Paganism is far from unattractive; indeed 'tis embellished with libidinous and communal fortitudes. Isle Summerisle's macabre manipulation of Messr. Howie is masterfully evoked,  emphasized especially with the scene on the last morning where his boat malfunctions...
The players ply their trade effectively; Woodward puts not a jot out of place in his crucial role; Lee is satisfactory in his way, if not brilliant, as Lord Summerisle. The minor parts are all more than adequately performed, with Diane Cilento resplendent where some are tellingly hersuite.I must commend this picture for its use of music, mood and mummery to ingrain a baffled indulgence on its viewers; if you are of the agreeable sensibility, you'll damn well love this film...

It's a feast to our eyes and senses first of all, even if we all deny it.Then it comes the metaphor of a judgemental society turned against itself. The police man is the whole film judging what he is seeing, because it's different from what he knows - the prejudice all around yes.and then, when he feels the risk he starts to talk to Jesus, even if before that we didn't find him THAT Christian. It works pretty well.So the film has that message, even though it works more as a bizarre ritualistic horror film, or whatever it may be called. And it's fun, the characters are somehow wicked. The only criticism for me is how the things are shown to the viewer. Of course that WE are the policeman, but we feel him like a stone coming to one event to the other. Maybe i saw the shorter version, i believe the longer cut would reveal more about the character.

135,Mr_Censored,"""Shocks are so much better absorbed with the knees bent.""",8,15 March 2010,"Perhaps the cult film to end all cult films -- due to the fact that it is a cult film that concerns, well, a cult -- ""The Wicker Man"" is a highly influential and surreal story about a devout Christian police officer sent to a remote island in Scotland in search of a missing girl. Things go awry, as not only does the hedonistic way of life these islanders enjoy clash with that of the officer's beliefs, but also because no one will tell him the truth about what happened to or what will become of the missing child.Filmed entirely on location in Scotland, ""The Wicker Man"" has a sense of authenticity that is driven home by a pair of knock-out performances in Edward Woodward and the legendary Christopher Lee. Woodward, as the would-be hero, keeps things grounded even at their most bizarre and ridiculous. His grim facial expressions and looks of horror say it all. Lee, on the other side of the coin, is playing the enigmatic leader of the cult, and is certainly in his prime in one of his finest roles. Elsewhere, the acting ranges from questionable to non-existent, but because these two men deliver in spades, the film rarely suffers.Granted, there's a wealth of musical numbers that make things a bit awkward, but maybe that's the intention. Afterall, most of the film seems aimed at catching its audience off-guard and creeping it out, and to that end, it certainly succeeds. Even nearly forty years later, it still manages to at least make you uncomfortable one way or another, whether it's through the unassuming scenery, the outrageous costumes and rituals or simply in its shocking ending that will certainly leave you with a little extra left to chew on.

Whatever you feel after watching the film, you'll certainly be affected one way or another, and that's the film's ultimate brilliance.",The Wicker Man
136,Christopher_Reid,"One of the scariest, most haunting movies I've ever seen",9,8 January 2015,"I actually feel rattled after having watched this movie. I'm barely affected by most horrors and even though this isn't really a horror, it was incredibly disturbing. I found it hilariously weird and yet very engaging for the first three quarters but the last parts left me speechless. There are images which will be ingrained in my mind for the rest of my life. Like many great movies, it leaves you thinking for a long time afterwards. I'm going back over the movie in my mind, piecing things together. I see many of the scenes and words in a different light now. They exist in a deeper context now that I understand the full story.The Irish music is very gorgeous but also unsettling. You sense something is a bit off from right near the beginning. A bit like A Clockwork Orange, the music jars with the tone and events of the film in a way that makes it far more sinister than if we had dark, moody music.I'm reminded of the Joker in terms of the level of planning and control demonstrated here. It's impressive but psychotic. The Wicker Man is also very similar to Rosemary's Baby in the amount of isolation and confusion the main character feels. They don't feel supported and the people they meet are acting strange or indifferent to the point that they may begin to question their own sanity.Another theme which is present is the casual indifference to another person's pain to the point where laughter and joy can be enjoyed regardless. We can often understand why someone would commit a crime out of jealousy or rage or passion, but when they are gleefully ignorant of a person's suffering, when they show no empathy at all, we suspect pure evil.At first, the policeman's religious beliefs seem irrelevant and distracting. What matters is the difference between right and wrong, to simply be a decent human being and part of a healthy society. But over time we find that his religion is just a strong part of who he his; an atheist would probably have a similar reaction to what he sees but simply word their objections differently. Jesus may be irrelevant to exactly what's happening, but for him, the most direct way to express his disgust and disapproval is to turn to the words and ways of Christianity.Christopher Lee is extremely charismatic and commanding. He's tall and has a deep voice but also emanates a gentleness or kindness. He seems to emphasise almost every word he speaks. It sounds as though he sincerely believes everything he says. He could surely be extremely persuasive if he wanted to be. Britt Ekland seems to be a nymphomaniac, I'm not sure. She is very sexy and tries to tempt the main character. Even though she appears young and innocent and her sexuality makes her alive and human, the policeman still finds her untrustworthy and doesn't feel comfortable with her.Many of the other characters are suitably but subtly crazy (or seem that way). It's often annoying in murder-mysteries where every character is a suspect and acts overly suspiciously and then the actual culprit is some random person and the explanation is stupid. Here, the way the locals behave adds to the policeman's stress and isolation - he doesn't understand their culture or lifestyle which just exacerbates his difficulty in solving the crime he's investigating.I highly recommend The Wicker Man as it's very unique, has a strange and mysterious mood and is very thought-provoking and memorable by the end.",The Wicker Man
137,ags123,Bottom of the barrel. Truly.,1,4 December 2005,"Based on all the glowing comments posted on this site, I bought the DVD thinking I'd discovered an overlooked treasure. Well, I could barely sit through this embarrassing, amateurish nonsense. It's hard to imagine why anyone would think this film is good. The story aspires to be another ""Rosemary's Baby"" with all that religious hokum. The ""musical numbers"" are downright painful; I wanted to crawl into a hole. Production values are worthy of a homemade porn movie. The costumes look like they were salvaged from a defunct Renaissance Festival. And exactly what was supposed to be so shocking about the ending? No suspense, poorly constructed plot, self- conscious acting. Just plain awful.",The Wicker Man
138,peeedeee-94281,The 'horror' is in how it ends!,9,26 November 2019,"Before I ever saw this film, I had read a lot about it being a horror film. I also saw a few pictures, like the hand of glory beside the bed, and assumed it was a scary movie from beginning to end.
But then I got the chance to actually watch it. I don't remember my first reaction to it, I wasn't upset. I was probably more perplexed in the direction it was going, and also the musical nature of this film. But it was an intriguing journey.
Then comes the horrific ending! That's where the horror of this movie actually lies. The protagonist in this movie played by Edward Woodward acts more like an antagonist. He doesn't come across as being very sympathetic. But still, by the end of the film, you do feel bad for him, to put it mildly lol.
I've got the DVD of the wooden box, which contained an interesting documentary about the saga of this film. It's not the making of this film that's interesting, but the fate of the negatives. I wonder if someone wasn't upset with this film and deliberately had it destroyed? That's the conspiracy theorist in me.
I've also watched and owned different versions, including the Media VHS, which has a longer intro showing Sgt Howie's life, and his reputation with his fellow officers, prior to leaving for Summer Isle. The theatrical version just starts with him flying to Summer Isle, but has a few scenes from that beginning section later in the movie, as a flashback. All versions work, it's just a shame the director's original vision was never realised since the negatives were trashed.
One of the best films of the horror genre, without so much as a drop of blood. The Wicker Man is a rare gem of a film.",The Wicker Man
139,j-lacerra,Snicker Man,5,21 May 2009,"This original Wicker Man, although head and shoulders above the wretched Nick Cage remake, is a poor excuse for a thriller. It would have to be a thriller because there is not the slightest hint of horror in the film, with perhaps the exception of the hero's perception of his situation at the end.The film has an amateurish and slapped together feel to it. The music, which sometimes has characters bursting into song, is inappropriate and distracting. Neither cinematography or sound rise above an amateur level.Edward Woodward is excellent as the obsessive policeman sent to investigate the disappearance of a young girl from a remote Scottish island. He soon finds that the island's inhabitants are, without exception, lascivious and perverted ... and liars.Christopher Lee is terrible in the role of the island's lead citizen and benefactor. Poor Lee is further handicapped by a series of awful costumes, hair styles and wigs. One of the latter appears to have been directly stolen from Cher. Lee is not alone in suffering in idiotic costumes. Virtually the entire cast is forced to don appalling get-ups before this show is done.Supporting and character roles are the most fetching in this film, and an ample helping of female nudity serves to boost excitement during otherwise boring moments.Without revealing the finale, some questions come to mind. How did the islanders know the policeman that would be sent would be, believe it or not, a virgin? How did they know that he would not re-board his plane and leave after the first few blind leads? Portrayed as a upstanding cop, why is he constantly threatening people, breaking and entering, and trying to force his moral standards on the citizenry? All in all, a diverting way to spend an hour and a half, the Wicker Man fails on more levels than it succeeds upon. Hardly qualifying as a cult film, Wicker Man is a mild film about a cult.",The Wicker Man
140,freaky_dave,Stunning and hard to forget,8,7 January 2008,"Last night I watched director Robin Hardy's 1973 movie The Wicker Man and was completely stunned by what was on the screen. I have heard good things about this movie, and decided to watch it on demand. The music is one of the many things that makes this movie work, along with decent performances by the actors involved, and disturbing scenes that seemed torn from an ancient past.A police officer named Sargeant Hardy (Edward Woodward) comes to an island village in search of a missing girl. The locals deny she ever existed and don't offer him much help. They aren't hostile per say, but you get a sense that something just isn't right about them. After discovering some strange rituals that go on which involve Pagan religion, Howie becomes suspicious and, being a Christian man an all, appalled and disgusted by what is going on. He continues his search for the missing girl using his authority as an officer of the law. He has an idea about what's happening, but never truly suspects where this trip to the island is really going to lead him until the shocking ending which I will not reveal.The folk music that opens the movie was perfect for a film such as this one. It fits in with everything that goes on. There are dance numbers as well, and one in particular involves Britt Ekland who plays Willow. This scene, which is rather unusual but surprising for a movie out in 1973, will become important to the plot of the film and the shocking journey that follows at the end.The scenery is eerie and though this film is not scary, well not until the shocking conclusion anyway, it is more of a mood piece that pulls you in and creeps you out instead. The atmosphere is creepy as well, and Christopher Lee as Lord Summerisle is perfect in his role. He never appears terrifying, but you easily sense that there is a reason to be frightened of this man.The film is the director's take on two distinct and different religions. Edward Woodward as the passionate Christian fits the mold well. His distaste for Pagan religion feels completely genuine, not like that of a man just playing a part. You feel his anger and disgust. The island's inhabitants also fit their beliefs as well. They never appear to be actors, but a real society that might easily exist somewhere in the world.Weird, creepy, shocking. These words all fit as descriptions of The Wicker Man. The film is neither gory nor terrifying, but it will make your blood run cold anyway. Highly recommended. I've never seen the remake, but this film is a definite must see.",The Wicker Man
141,seawalker,It's a masterpiece,9,2 September 2007,"A while ago, after watching ""Goldfinger"" as part of the Summer Of British Films festival, my friend asked me if I wanted to see ""The Wicker Man"".The blood drained out of my face. I felt sick and dizzy. I started to shake. I stuttered... ""No... The Bees... The Bees...""I broke away from him. I ran into the road. A truck bore down on me...My friend grabbed my arm and pulled me to safety.""No, you silly fool"", he said. ""Not that rubbish Nicolas Cage was in. The proper version.""Phew! That was OK then.And so it was that on Tuesday night that we went to see ""The Wicker Man"" (the proper version.)Masterpiece is not a word that I throw around a lot with regard to films. (I don't see how any film can be considered a masterpiece until several years have gone by.) I will make an exception for ""The Wicker Man"", because it is a little, British masterpiece. Edited and unappreciated on it's original release, but discovered and turned into a cult by a generation of late night television viewers, I think that it is one of the best British films, never mind horror films, of all time.It must be said, except for the final traumatic scenes of the great Edward Woodward screaming for help from a God that cannot help him, ""The Wicker Man"" is hardly a horror film at all. It is incredibly funny (watching it with an audience really brings that home), very thoughtful, sensual and strange. Rough around the edges it certainly is, but it contains should-have-been award worthy performances by Edward Woodward (from arrogance to disquiet to true panic and horror - the best thing he has ever done) and a cheerfully, sinister Christopher Lee (who says that it is the best thing he has ever done - he might well be right.)It's a masterpiece.

What he finds is a community of heathens openly worshipping nature and the cycle of re-birth. That sinister things are going on is evident from the very beginning. But his investigations reveal the goings-on layer by layer with an completely unexpected and shocking final few minutes.Apart from the excellent script, the low-budget Hammer atmosphere plays a big role in making this so effective. Plus, there is an amazing performance by the talented but so frequently under-used Christopher Lee as the head pagan Lord Summerisle. Its refreshing to see him dressed and looking like a normal person and equally frightening when he dons a long wig during the May Day pagan festival.Not for children primarily due to copious amounts of nudity, The Wicker Man is possibility the best Brit Horror film out there.

They play games with the sergeant and mock his christianity, he is appalled to find this haven of heathens isolated away. His attempt to return to the mainland is prevented by the sabotage of his plane by the locals, now he his trapped and fighting for survival. The film leads to a shocking last scene.

Kinda like Mary Poppins meets the Exorcist, you really don't know which direction the film will take, and I guess that is what the appeal of this movie is. I can't say that I didn't like this film, nor can I say that it is a Classic horror film. Lord Summerisle(Christopher Lee) with a permanent, says this was one of his greatest roles, I can't say that I can agree with him, but you really have to judge for yourself.Sergeant Howie(Edward Woodward) in a good performance, keeps the film together, as the devout Christian policeman, who becomes a human marshmallow roast, so to speak. Sgt. Howie is sent to find a missing girl, only to learn of this bizarre behavior of the locals.Apparently, last years harvest didn't go so well, so the thinking of the local clan is a human sacrifice, and Edward fills the bill very nicely. For some reason, Scotland gets noticeable credit as the only filming location. Whatever , I never got a sense of surprise or horror, just aggravation or annoyance for not being able to find the missing girl.So, while this film gets HIGH ratings, just see it for yourself, at 88 minutes or the longer Directors cut, which give more BIOS on Sgt.

Those familiar with Scots Culture and tradition will unsheathe difficult and often uncomfortable points of recognition and dread as they follow Edward Woodward's doomed expedition to find a missing girl in the insular Island community. The naked couples romping in fields outside the local pubs, the institutional paganism, the horse costumes, the profound ignorance of the local people, the desecrated religious monuments, the culture of inbreeding and the construction of large sacrificial vessels for unsuspecting tourists - all important tenets of agrarian communities in the north but sadly not to be found in tourist literature on the area. In Fact the Scottish Tourist Information website only lists Summerisle as 'great for a pub lunch'.This is a chilling slice of island life in which we're invited to consider our good fortune in having embraced Enlightenment thinking (in as much as some of us have), developed industrial practise and liberal values. Lord 'leave no traces' Summerisle, the very personification of the argument for the reform of the upper house, leads a community in which the people would rather burn visitors and wait for the next apple crop than send someone across to the mainland to visit a supermarket.

This is definitely one of the strangest films I have ever seen.The characters were disturbing to say the least, all they do is commit sexual acts and lie to the Howie the whole time. The amount of sexual themes in this movie could give the Piranha movies a run for their money. There was a fair bit of suspense towards the end, but it was unsatisfying in the end. Some points in the film I didn't know to laugh or shake my head in disgust.There is not much to say about this film other than it was a waste of time and money.

As he delves deeper and deeper into the mystery he finds himself in greater and greater risk of incurring the wrath of the villagers and their sinister practices. Christopher Lee is the Lord in charge of the community and he is what we would nowadays call a flower child and the townspeople are right behind him. The ending is a shocker and crazy to boot.

This film is more about Christianity than bizarre ""pagan"" cults.Sgt Howie arrives as a lone representative of the ""civilised"" mainland, he's constantly reminding the inhabitants of Summerisle the law of the land and their responsibilities as Christian citizens.It's Howie's naivety and single minded obsession with uncovering the truth that is ultimately and ironically the very thing the islanders are searching for.This is a movie that reflects a broader fear in society that the old pillars of establishment were becoming irrelevant, The Wicker Man is a clear challenge to that order.The scene in the grave yard where Howie improvises a cross and the final scene when he is being burned as his own ""martyr"" to his faith while reciting a confusion of desperate prayer and scripture while gods creatures burn around him, is as much about the impotence of faith as the threat of non-Christian ""paganism"".Throughout the film there are constant references to the absurdity of Christianity, the scene where Howie challenged Lorn Summerisle's faith and he's reminded that Jesus's mother was ""..a virgin impregnated by a ghost"".Back in the early 1970s the atrocities Vietnam war, the collapse of the British empire and the threat of nuclear apocalypse was very real.

I had put this film on hold for a very long time, and I shouldn't have! Let's get into it! All the film is about is it sets on a Sergeant who comes to an island full of rituals and sacrificial killings, trying to locate a missing girl who the locals of the island claimed never existed. From there on, it's an unpredictable plot full of twists to whether this girl is real, alive, dead, fantasy or just a myth???? It could be any of those things and I'm not going to give away a cent of this thrilling film because you need to see it! All I can say is that this film is high on thrills, has many great mystery plots, contains it's level of violence and builds on the suspense throughout different scenes, with no music (only singing from the locals) creating a sense and feel of loneliness and isolation.Anyway, it's a classic and people need to see it and forget the remake. This film also let's you think and work out the different results in the actions that the Sergeant makes. The locals of the town give you the suspicion whether the Sergant should trust them and they're very unpredictable in their actions and the decisions they make throughout. It also plays with the mind, tending to let you continually point out what is going on. It's also very unpredictable and it will leave you shocked towards the end!!! The ending scene is the most unexpected and really leaves you in a web of questions! But nether the less it's worth it and definitely up there in the group of horrors and thrillers.It's also a rare gem and to me another one of those films which really go the two genres going. It's on the level of Black Christmas, Rosemary's Baby, Night of the Living Dead, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Last House of the Left and of course Halloween. Just naming a few. Even Psycho :P Wraping it up, the film deserves a solid 9/10 for the mysterious themes which play throughout and it's cleverness to keep your eyes glued to the screen.

The policeman is shocked - SHOCKED I tell you! - about their immoral, unChristianlike behavior. It's extremely obvious that the whole point of the film is to shock the audience, but I just wasn't shocked. The actual story takes a backseat to all these transparent attempts to shock us, and at it's core it's a very simple story, and it's seems more or less forgotten for long stretches of the movie. This is a mystery, and as such, it certainly doesn't distinguish itself. The ending is just so stupid I couldn't help but cringe. And laugh. The policeman giving a fire and brimstone sermon, screaming at the top of his lungs...good lord this is just idiotic.I'll give it 3 stars because it had some interesting scenery and some nice little set pieces like the naked girls dancing around the miniature Stonehenge, but that's about it. Too bad the people involved in making it didn't take more interest in actually presenting us with a good suspenseful story about Paganism instead of constantly snickering to themselves ""Can you imagine what people will think when they see this?

158,dtb,A Subtle Masterpiece of Suspense and the Pitfalls of Religious Intolerance,9,30 January 2008,"The 2-disc DVD edition of the 1973 British cult classic THE WICKER MAN (TWM) includes the 88-minute cut that played in theaters and the restored 99-minute version. If you're expecting a high body count, slam-bang action, and fast-paced editing of the sort spoofed so brilliantly in HOT FUZZ (also featuring TWM star Edward Woodward), you may feel impatient, but chill out and pay attention, and you just might be glad you did.After a puckish opening title screen thanking the people of Summerisle ""for this privileged insight into their religious practices and for their generous co-operation in the making of this film,"" Sir Anthony Shaffer's screenplay tells the story of Police Sgt. Neil Howie (Woodward) investigating an anonymous tip begging him to find Rowan Morrison (Geraldine Cowper), a 12-year-old girl living  or is she?  on Summerisle, an island off Scotland that's renowned for its apples and other produce. A staunch Catholic and by-the-book police officer, Sgt. Howie's expectations are confounded from square one. When he arrives via seaplane for an overnight stay, expecting to be served fresh Summerisle apples and veggies, he's surprised to be handed a plateful of turquoise-hued beans from a can. Indeed, all the islanders seem to be eating nothing but canned produce as Summerisle's apple crates lie empty. But that's nothing compared to Howie's outrage as his investigation reveals that the islanders, led by Lord Summerisle (Christopher Lee in a performance brimming with urbane mischief and menace) are all free-thinking, free-loving pagans.The culture clash between Howie and the Summerislers lends TWM as much wry humor as mystery and suspense. Things only get weirder, creepier, and often, more titillating as everyone he meets stymies his investigation into Rowan's disappearance. Everybody from Rowan's family to her teacher, Miss Rose (Diane Cilento), to Lord Summerisle himself initially deny that Rowan even exists, then claim she's dead, thenwell, with the strange excuses and even stranger rituals on Summerisle, the determined Howie has his work cut out for him as the film reaches its shocking climax.Over the years, fans and critics alike have tried to stuff TWM into the horror and fantasy categories, perhaps because the cast includes Lee and fellow genre movie veterans Ingrid Pitt and Britt Ekland. However, anyone anticipating traditional monsters, copious bloodletting, or F/X-oriented frights will be disappointed; that's not what TWM is about. For all its suspense, we never see anything supernatural happen; even the weirdest things can be explained by real-world circumstances. There's a bit of low-key gore, but by and large, the monstrousness is of a purely human variety, the evil and intolerance that lives and lurks quietly like a sleeper cell in people's hearts, minds, and belief systems. To me, that's scarier than any supernatural creature, because it hits closer to home.TWM creates an air of unworldly unease, of events beyond what we can see and hear, keeping us guessing to the end. Between the uniformly fine acting, Robin Hardy's skillful direction, and Shaffer's slyly sinister script, TWM is a great example of how you don't need endless gore and sadism to chill an audience to the bone, just suspense crafted from atmospheric direction, a stellar cast, and foreboding arising from the enigmatic circumstances, character development, and a location whose beauty hides its treachery.Shaffer's script plays fair, trusting the audience to keep up with its skillful combination of wit, mystery, and dread. The characterizations are fascinating throughout, particularly with Sgt. Howie and Lord Summerisle. My husband and I have joked more than once that, in the end, what really killed poor, well-meaning, stalwart Sgt. Howie was the stick up his ass. Even before he realized he'd been tricked, that he and not Rowan was the intended blood sacrifice that the Summerislers hoped would appease their ancient gods and jump-start their crops, Howie showed nothing but hostility and intolerance towards the placid islanders' religious practices. If he'd only loosened up and let himself be seduced by the bewitching Willow McGregor, he'd have lost his virginity, rendered himself useless as a blood sacrifice, and saved his own life. God and Howie's fiancée would've forgiven him, I'm sure. :-) I'll admit that as much as I love the film as is, there's always a part of me that wishes they could have had one last shot set one year later, showing whether Summerisle had their hoped-for bumper crop or, perhaps, showing Lord Summerisle himself being dragged into the wicker man and set aflame after another disastrous barren year. Yeah, I guess it's better to keep the audience guessing, but closure has its merits, too.Paul Giovanni's haunting music, with traditional Celtic songs woven throughout, is practically another character in the film, by turns erotic and beautiful, bawdy and joyful, fitting the film's tone perfectly. No wonder Eli Roth used ""Willow's Song"" in a key scene in HOSTEL! As Willow, Ekland looks luscious and does a decent Scots accent, though her singing is dubbed by Annie Ross, and some shots of her backside were done by a body double. But why quibble when there's such a powerful erotic charge to watching Willow drive poor Howie nearly mad by, well, making love to the wall separating her room from his? Say what you will about pagans, they know how to party! :-) The DVD's extras include the restored version and a terrific commentary track on Disc 2, with moderator Mark Kermode interviewing Hardy, Lee, and Woodward, exchanging entertaining stories about the tricks involved in making a low-budget, tight-scheduled movie while studio British Lion was on the slippery slope to bankruptcy. Disc 1's excellent documentary featurette, The Wicker Man Enigma, includes interviews with Woodward, Lee, Pitt, Hardy, Shaffer, and Roger Corman, as well as the jaw-dropping story of the idiots who thought they were putting the TWM negative in a vault but instead put it in a waste pile that was buried under England's M3 highway!",The Wicker Man

Yet few would interpret The Wicker Man, the 1973 British cult classic, as particularly scary in the traditional sense. It is in the themes and ideas behind the film, however, that the element of horror is to be found. Like its American contemporaries The Exorcist and The Omen, The Wicker Man deals with that most effective of horror themes: religion.Having been anonymously alerted to the mysterious disappearance of a young girl from the remote Scottish island community of Summerisle, Sergeant Neil Howie encounters difficulties in his search for answers in the form of the obdurate islanders, who fervently deny the girl's existence.That a film so regularly ranked highly in horror ""best of"" lists can contain traces of a musical might seem perplexing, even contradictory, the mutual exclusivity of the genres surely set in stone. Much of The Wicker Man's effect, however, can be attributed to its musical heritage, its eerie atmosphere of impending threat engendered primarily through the heavy usage of folk songs. On the second day of his visit, Sergeant Howie encounters a group of children dancing around a maypole, the increasingly rapid tempo of their song lending a sense of unsettling urgency to their otherwise harmless actions. The song outlines the basis of the community's beliefs, namely reincarnation and the old gods of the earth and the sun. The paganism which characterizes the islanders immediately establishes the film's religious commentary. Howie is a fundamentalist Christian, his views steadfast and self-assured. He is repulsed and repelled by what he encounters in Summerisle, the openly practiced sexual rituals and teaching to schoolchildren of phallic symbolism the direct antithesis to his conservative views of celibacy and quietly reverential worship. Played inimitably by Edward Woodward, Howie in many ways represents 1970s British society itself, at one point sternly reminding Lord Summerisle—the leader of the island, authoritatively portrayed by the great Christopher Lee—that he remains the subject of a Christian country. The dynamic that exists between the two characters juxtaposes their respective faiths, Howie's protestations that Summerisle is a place of heathenism and the community's practices ludicrous indulgences in sacrilegious nonsense countered immediately, the similarly far-fetched elements of Christian doctrine highlighted, scrutinized, and ridiculed as just as unbelievable and absurd. Lee brings an avuncular grace to his performance, his retorts simultaneously firmly definitive and benignly inoffensive—a description, incidentally, which rather effectively summates the film itself. Whilst not strictly anti-Catholic, the film takes a skeptical stance to organized religion, Woodward's depiction of his character as uptight and immovably fastidious deliberately preventing the audience from meaningful identification with him. Summerisle and its population are presented in such a way that we are made to question whether the strict society Howie represents is really a more appealing prospect. The island is inexplicably opulent, its crime rate all but non-existent, its inhabitants close-knit and undeniably satisfied with life. Indeed, even Howie himself is tempted by the allure of this alternative way of life, a particularly memorable scene in which the young woman in the room next to his nakedly dances, pounding his wall and singing a hypnotically mesmeric song conveying the testing of his ideologies. Like the audience, Howie is fascinated by this culture and, though he maintains an austere facade, sees in it the kind of free-spirited life which he can never himself enjoy.Effectively utilizing music to create an atmosphere of tense unease, The Wicker Man is a film replete with religious imagery, symbolism, and detailed commentary upon the role of religion in society and its effect upon its followers. Impressively acted—particularly by its two leads—it is the kind of film which remains embedded in the mind long after viewing, its chilling effect making it impossible to forget. After all, isn't that what great horror should do?",The Wicker Man
162,wisemantonofski,Sir Christopher Lee at his Finest,10,5 February 2019,"As bizarre as it is hauntingly chilling, this film is a dark exploration of the occult that keeps you hooked from its intriguing start to its tragic finish. Everything from its settings to its melodic folk score weaves an atmosphere of mysticism and uncertainty, never really allowing the audience to relax as its strange story unfolds scene by scene. Its said that the scariest form of horror is that which revolves around the human mind, and to that end The Wicker Man is a cautionary tale of the dark lengths a disturbed mind will go to in the name of faith, a warning to remain ever vigilant against unseen machinations as this seemingly aimless series of events lures everyone involved, characters and audience alike, into the clutches of its terrible climax.",The Wicker Man
163,stefankrs,Masterpiece,9,23 September 2021,"This movie is really one strange masterpiece. A unique movie, with strange people and events, very unsettling. The movie is a mystery and makes you guess what happened to the girl? Where is she? Is she real?, just so many questions. It is has a very interesting story and keeps you hooked on what is going to happen next. Beautiful scenery, music, cast. Amazing horror movie, one of the best. Definitely recommend this masterpiece and midsommar. (2 similar strange cult movies)",The Wicker Man
164,mungflesh,Battle of beliefs,9,4 October 2001,"BIG SPOILERS starting 3rd paragraph. Read only 1st 2 if you've not seen the film.I recently bought 4 movies whilst on holiday in Canada, 4 horror films which are either unavailable, banned or cut in the UK.They were Deep Red, I Spit on Your Grave, Zombie and The Wicker Man. After watching them all (!) in 1 afternoon / evening only one film left me feeling truly chilled ... The Wicker Man. Featuring no gore, no violence as we would expect from a horror and no explicit language out of context this is a proud example of what the horror genre needs more of.The Wicker Man has the audience seeing the ending from a long way off and yet teases them that all will turn out ok in the end, but In one of the most traumatic finales I have ever seen, it doesn't.The weird imagery and music of the majority of the film builds up a surreal, dream-like atmosphere from which we are abruptly awaken as Sgt Howie chases Alice (Rowan) out of the rabbit-hole from wonderland into a waking nightmare. Our feeling of security in his authority as a police officer is stripped as he is stripped and dressed in sacrificial robes.In his desperate plea to the villagers, Sgt Howie's reasoning falls on deaf ears, as though he were talking in another language, except the barrier here is belief and religion rather than words and meaning. Even Howie himself appears to lose faith as his rock-solid character crumbles and his prayers to Christ turn to profanity as he screams 'Jesus'.With fantastic performances all-round, this is a rare gem of a british movie and knocks spots off the Hammer ""movie template"".",The Wicker Man
165,evilskip,An over rated film,3,6 October 1999,"This is a cult film revered by many.The story concerns a religious zealot of a policeman flying to an island to search for a missing girl.Naturally no one has heard of the girl and everyone acts a bit off the norm. So Inspector Howe stays to investigate.Seems that the island is full of pagans and the girl may have been sacrificed to the ""older gods"" to provide bountiful crops.So the obnoxious Howie lectures the heathen islanders, exhumes graves and generally p*&^%s everyone off including the viewers.The ""twist"" ending is okay but nothing earth shattering. You could examine this film and say that it is a jaundiced view of current religion and its clash with older beliefs.Or it is a comparison of a simpler way of life as opposed to modern day living.You can be as artsy as you like but evilskip thinks its a piece of bulldookey. The ""hero"" is detestable.You want to give him a swift kick in the groin immediately.(Woodward does make the best he can out of a one dimensional character).Christopher Lee (Lord Summerisle)considers this his best work.Why?Maybe because he gets to wear a kilt, a wig and sing a few awful songs very badly.The soundtrack bites as we are forced to endure early 1970's folk tunes.Whoever wrote these insipid lyrics must have had a frontal lobotomy.I wanted to hit the mute button whenever the songs started to play.The simple island folk are so weird a normal person would get the *&^% out of there in a heartbeat.The only thing this movie has going for it is a gratuitous nude scene by Ingrid Pitt(YES!!).That is the only reason this movie gets a 3.Well the scenery is nice. This movie was nearly ""lost"" as many of the negatives were being used as road filler.Too bad they found it.",The Wicker Man

I watched it over a week ago now and I'm still not sure what to say about it. On one hand, the disturbing path that this movie took was enjoyable to experience but, on the other hand, the outcome was predictable and the over-the-top Christianity and the cult beliefs being called paganism kind of got on my nerve. Overall, it's a weird combination of horror and mystery.That, however, doesn't mean the film is bad. The story did grab my attention and kept me interested, even when I knew how it will end. It gets really bizarre at some points but it does a decent job at building suspense as the creepy factor increases as the story progresses.

168,imdb-19548,Disappointing.,4,24 February 2008,Having heard about this film for so long I can't see what all the fuss was about.Perhaps at the time of release the idea of a pagan island was shocking to people but I found the idea of the police man running around getting angry and upset about the loss of Christian practices on the island a bit annoying.There are quite a few long musical moments that irritated me and added nothing to the story.That said the performances by Woodward and Lee are excellent and manage to save the film from being awful but nothing would make it good.I had already seen clips of the ending on TV numerous times so the surprise was lost on me but it is still a good and believable ending.Perhaps a masterpiece at the time it simply hasn't aged well enough to be worth watching.,The Wicker Man

It was easy to see where the story was heading, so there was no shock of surprise.Seeing Woodward in such a strong and steadfast role was wonderful, and watching the great Christopher Lee explode out of the Hammer film horror machine with a new, vibrant and libertine character was excellent.Unfortunately, fighting off sleep became my battle instead of immersing myself into the film. I plan on giving the movie another look in the future, but if it could lull me to sleep, what does that say about it overall?",The Wicker Man
170,bt698nhj,Do not watch sober,5,10 June 2016,"I realized my mistake shortly after the film ended. I should have drunk or done drugs before watching this kaleidoscopic flick.Talk about an avant garde exercise in theatrical narcissism. This film is over the top. The film bounces merrily along, simultaneously tracking the devout Christian policeman's investigation of a missing girl and his abject horror at the paganism of the island folk, intertwining much nudity and bizarre scenes that, while mildly interesting, seem a bit overdone. The finale, while bizarre in itself, salvaged a 5-star rating as it finally tied the movie together. Recommended only if you are under the influence. About my reviews:I do not offer a synopsis of the film -- you can get that anywhere and that does not constitute a meaningful review -- but rather my thoughts and feelings on the film that hopefully will be informative to you in deciding whether to invest 90-180 minutes of your life on it.

171,Snake-666,"Creative, entertaining and tragic. A beautiful picture.",10,27 September 2003,"The Wicker Man' follows the story of Sgt. Howie (Edward Woodward) who travels to the Scottish island of Summerisle to investigate the disappearance of a young girl. However, the entire population of the island, including the girl's own mother (Irene Summers), denies that such a girl ever existed and as the righteous Howie investigates further he learns the terrifying truth of Summerisle. Famed for an exceptional yet short performance from the legendary Christopher Lee as Lord Summerisle, The Wicker Man' is a textbook example of how to create a virtually seamless horror/thriller. Director Robin Hardy at one point thought this low-budget movie would never be made as he was forced to work with a very small budget, a short shooting schedule and a studio on the verge of bankruptcy that was in fact declared bankrupt just a few short months after filming was completed. However, The Wicker Man' was made and nowadays is accepted as one of the finest horror/thrillers of all-time despite not receiving the praise it so deserved back in the Seventies. The Wicker Man' was brilliantly written by Anthony Shaffer who chose to add very subtle clues as to what would happen that are made more apparent on further viewings. With the added advantage of obvious research into the pagan rituals The Wicker Man' sought to portray the movie is left with a chilling feel of realism. An enchanting soundtrack is blended marvellously into The Wicker Man' which seems to lull the viewer into a false sense of security. Despite the constant foreboding feeling created by the intricate plot and top notch acting, there is a certain playful feeling that is brought about by the elegant soundtrack making it difficult to actually envisage any evil events occuring. One could be forgiven for wondering on a first viewing just where this bizarre little movie is going but the story has a quality about it that can grab the viewer and keep their interest all the way to the bitter and awfully haunting ending. The final scene as the credits roll is an image that is now engrained on my mind with all its emptiness and despair. As the curtain falls on this performance (so to speak) it becomes hard not to question the events leading up to the end and the humanity of these islanders. In some ways The Wicker Man' is an unsettling history lesson that makes itself seem all too real. Edward Woodward gives a tremendous performance as the increasingly baffled Sgt. Howie. He played his character convincingly and Howie's eventual realisation of what is going on around him is portrayed so well that it adds more realism to the movie. Woodward was able to take a character that may be a figure of loathing in another type of horror movie and make the audience feel empathy towards him. The strong religious beliefs within Howie thoroughly clash with the free-loving pagan society which adds humour and distress at the same time. However, as mentioned before, Christopher Lee somehow stole the show playing the relatively small part of Lord Summerisle. His magnificent onscreen presence seems so powerful that one forgets that he is only in the movie for a short amount of time. Added to this great mix was Britt Ekland as Willow, the beautiful landlord's daughter. Her seductive, nude dance (though a double was apparently used in parts) was one of the most erotic moments in horror and helped to contribute further realism to the movie. The scenes featuring the clashing characters of Howie and Willow are both amusing and tense making for some interesting character interaction. The Wicker Man' is undoubtedly a cult classic of the horror genre which I recommend to all fans of horror/thrillers. Visually pleasing with some superb acting and direction as well as a fine screenplay. My rating for The Wicker Man'  9/10.",The Wicker Man
172,matheusmarchetti,'One of it's kind' occult masterpiece,10,22 June 2010,"A cut above all the other Hammer films that were so popular at the time, Anthony Sheffer's mature and ahead of it's time occult chiller ""The Wicker Man"" is director Robin Hardy's unique attempt at the horror genre, whose originality and one-of-it's-kind style has never been doubled. With a bright Springtime setting, soft-focus cinematography, a 'friendly' folk soundtrack and oddly sympathetic antagonists, Hardy creates a falsely safe environment, which, like it does to our hero, draws the audience in, gradually uncovering a brooding atmosphere of dread and terror that lies beneath it's harmless surface. Though it does happen in a slow pace, when the horror of ""The Wicker Man"" finally shows it's face, it comes with full power, leaving the viewer stunned and shocked, with a finale so terrifying today as it was back in the 70's when it was first released. Anthony Sheffer's intelligent script does not only succeed in it's originality and suspense-build up, but also in creating an interesting analogy of Christianity vs. Paganism, while questioning the pros and cons of both religions. Thus, it makes us question who the real villains are, and rather disturbingly so, also forces us to reflect over whether the antagonist's action can actually be considered crimes. On top of it all, the film also benefits from a great cast, which includes Edward Woodward, the gorgeous Britt Ekland (who, by the way, stars one of the most deliciously erotic scenes in the film) as well as the horror veterans such as Ingrid Pitt and Christopher Lee, the latter being a particularly interesting choice as, though playing a villain, does it so much differently than what he did in his previous works. Overall, a masterpiece of horror cinema which, though unfairly received at it's release, is finally getting the recognition it deserves. 10/10",The Wicker Man

Fascinating, chilling, and utterly unique"", Infofreak from Perth, Australia, 17 August 2003) also has good information about Britt Ekland's famous seduction dance.***""Wicker Man"" is brave, erotic and disturbing. While it is widely considered one of the greatest horror films ever, it is sufficiently allegorical to represent a different conflict depending on who is watching it. Churchgoers may view it as an attack on their belief system. Others may perceive this as simply a detective mystery gone sour, as the investigation of a missing girl by British Police Sergeant Christian Howie (Edward Woodward) on a remote, Scotland island leads to an unexpected solution. There's Order vs. Chaos; Stability vs. Entropy. Considering the present times, it can represent a societal collapse, where social norms are disrupted.""Wicker Man"" also concerns the delayed schedule of a man's coming of age. A key plot point is Sergeant Howie's (no-sex-before-marriage) celibacy. During the police investigation, Howie resists the considerable temptations of the landlord's lascivious daughter Willow (Brit Ekland, and body double), whose erotically-charged, full-frontal-nude dancing will raise the temperature of most viewers. The audience is encouraged to believe the Sergeant is a fool for not having the girl. During the memorable May Day ritual, the Sergeant is wearing the costume of the medieval fool Puck. His failure to launch with Willow lends some credibility to what happens next.What I find most surprising about ""Wicker Man"" is the prevalence of hippie music, particularly early on. Considering the frights in store, this music seems counter-intuitive; not just with horror films, but in films where sanctimony and blasphemy appear.Visually, the imagery (directed by Robin Hardy and photographed by Harry Waxman) seems effortless. I like how the early scenes are rendered. While Sergeant Howie sermonizes in a church; the photography is grainy with high contrast and the colors are washed out. This look helps the viewer detach from the Sergeant's moral universe.The performances are stellar. Edward Woodward as Sgt Howie, Christopher Lee as the sinister and imposing Lord Summerisle, Britt Ekland (and body double) and Diane Cilento as Miss Rose inhabit their characters well. Lee, with his towering frame and charismatic basso voice, is the standout performer. The biggest star is arguably Anthony Shaffer for writing such an audaciously provocative screenplay.Contemporary, nymphomaniac and bloodthirsty Pagans are dancing naked and mocking orthodox Christian ways. That sounds like a movie to enjoy to me.",The Wicker Man
175,Dandy_Desmond,The Wicker Man - Not a horror but much more...,10,29 September 2009,"I saw this as a teenager advertised in the paper as a horror movie. My first experience of it was not good - i couldn't understand what all the fuss was about. I was at a movie show a few years ago and was fortunate enough to see Ingrid Pitt. I bought the DVD as it was cheap at the same show and give it another chance. I don't know what it was but second time around with no expectation of a 'classic horror' hanging over it I was enchanted. First of all was the music. fantastic beautiful music in which the highlight is most certainly Willows Song in which the stunning and naked Britt Ekland temps the virgin Christian Edward Woodward. Then there is the acting. All play their roles well - Christopher Lee is always great, Britt Ekland is simply delicious enough to eat but the real performance is from Edward Woodward. Such a mannered, carefully presented performance right up to the end when he really comes into his own as a terrified man realising he is the victim of a cruel game and facing his own death. The movie almost has a false sense of security - you never really think these people who are so happy, open and free would commit such a crime. But as Mr Woodwards character is led over the hill to his doom towards the towering wicker man we realise the true horror in the story. I would not describe The Wicker Man as a horror. I would describe it as magical, beautiful & ultimately tragic.",The Wicker Man

It does not cause fear, nor does it have explicit horror scenes. I decided to assist him on the recommendation of third parties. The highlight for the participation of the legendary Christopher Lee. The end of the film is its highlight and highlight that symbolizes the ultimate sacrifice for purification and obtaining a supernatural favor. My rating for this movie is just reasonable.

177,eddiez61,"A Slightly Corny & Silly, but Very Fun Fantasy/Thriller",8,1 August 2013,"I detest most religions and religious beliefs so it was easy for me to cheer for the Heathen islanders, even if they were a bit wacky. Edward Woodward's uptight, self righteous police officer, Sergeant Howie, is a barely sympathetic character, entirely confined and controlled by his demented, pointless Christian faith, and therefor is the perfect target for some devious, mean spirited, soul testing pranks. Christopher Lee is compelling as the aristocratic wizard, his innate sinister yet sophisticated charm perfectly suited for his role as gracious host of his private island's Pagan Party. Few other actors could so effectively generate such a charismatic image of formidable worldliness. Think of a more modest, more homey Gandalf.There's a very memorable scene of a very gorgeous and very nude Britt Ekland writhing in possessed, ritualistic desire. The risqué scene functions not just as a salacious exploitation of Brit's sensuous physique but also as a stylized Rorschach test by which we are very emphatically prompted to measure our own level of prurient repression. Sexual desire, as Christianity would have us believe, is unnatural and evil. Ha! Some of the dialog, especially in the later half, is unnecessarily deliberate and expository - it would have been much more mysterious and suspenseful to not have the motives and meanings so literally explained. Heathenism, even more so than Christianity, embraces irrational, nonlinear thought and so it isn't necessary to have the pagan islander's ideas and actions any more comprehensible than those of the good Detective's. In fact, I much prefer my Paganism entirely inscrutable, thank you.The finale is positively gruesome, aesthetically inspired, and undeniably satisfying. In spite of it's modest flaws - the most obvious one being why the islanders would bother to continue to deceive the Detective once he's trapped on their island - this nasty little thriller will definitely tickle your spiritual funny bone.",The Wicker Man

182,myboigie,Paganism vs. Christianity: Nobody-wins!,9,11 March 2006,"'Oh Christ, oh Jesus Christ!' Christopher Lee is dismissive of a lot of his screen-work, but this is one of his favorites (along-with The Whip and the Body). It's hard to call this a horror-film, but I guess you could say it is, depending-upon who you root-for. There really are no villains in this film, though hardcore religionists would say the pagans who inhabit the island are evil are just flat-wrong. Western civilization still has its sacrifices in our American death-penalty, and in warfare. Almost every generation is called-up to give-of-their-numbers to Mars, and the bottom-line. So-called conservative economists argue that a minimum-of-poverty is needed to maintain-capitalism/consumerism. There are sacrifices-aplenty in our 'modern' world, and they are hardly-removed from pagan-sacrifices, just more-removed and indirect from our daily-lives (what could be more ""modern""?). Oddly, the film is critical of the ancient and the modern.No, this is more a thriller, with a 'horror-reveal' at its climax, as it was created by director Robin Hardy. Sadly, the producers of the failing UK-studio balked at his cut, and we have been left-with cobbled-together theatrical and 'director's-cut' versions of the films with many of the scenes and insert-shots back, but from shoddy-sources like videotapes. The original-negatives of deleted material were hidden in-a-hole on an English country-road, according to Christopher Lee and others close to the production. Why? Why did RKO destroy an hour of Orson Welles's 'Magnificent Ambersons'? This is done as retribution by producers, so that a director can never reinsert-the-footage. Why? Partly because producers cannot usually create, and some of them resent this. It also gives them a chance to legally-assert authorship, and thus ownership of a property based under international copyright laws. Due to the butchering of The Wicker Man, Christopher Lee has attempted for decades to do a remake, but it appears it isn't going-to-happen with him now. The Nicholas Cage remake can only suffer from this fact, since it doesn't improve-upon the original. It actually does a poorer-job, yet has a budget almost twenty-times the 1973-version.Literally 'stealing-the-show', Lee plays the enigmatic and charming Lord Summerisle, and he haunts the entirety of the Wicker Man until the brutal-ending. The other protagonist of the film is the character of Sergeant Howie, who has been sent by the mainland-Police to investigate the disappearance of young-girl on the island, namesake of the Lee-character. This island is Lee's domain, and he has reinstituted pagan-beliefs alongside the island's agriculture--fruit-groves in the cold, hostile-environment of the Hebrides. The cop is entering a world he (and we, the audience) never knew existed. Unlike the remake, I'd say the Summerisle seems inviting and sensual. It's a place you might want to call home. As a stodgy-Christian, Howie doesn't really get this, and it seals-his-fate, a nice touch of irony.It appears the 'new-beliefs' (really ancient, British-ones) are working, for the crops are abundant and the people of Summerisle seem happy and prosperous. There are numerous-references to fertility-symbols, and the musical-numbers are both-inviting and haunting (if not a little goofy), & they lull Howie and the viewer into a complacency (as pagan-rituals do to their sacrifices). Seargeant Howie (a daft-name, chosen so the audience doesn't fully-identify with him) is being tested by the pagans for his purity, and the gorgeous Britt Ekland is the bait, though her acting is a bit 'wooden' (or is it 'Wicker'?). Still, she--and her body-double--add a great erotic-flavor to the film that makes paganism seem pretty inviting. Well, unless you are the sacrifice, though believers would likely have no-problem. This then, is the horror-component of the film, a non-believer sacrificed by believers.There are many-reviewers who have said this is about a battle-between paganism and orthodox-Christianity. This is accurate, but there are nuances to this, and comments on the surrender-to-irrationality by the pagans AND Sergeant Howie. Let's-face-it: the cop isn't likable, and we aren't really supposed to identify with him until the end, as simply a human-being caught-up in something he never wagered-on. Like a pagan-initiation, the story begins as a mystery, both tempting-and-warm, even human. The initiate penetrates more-and-more layers of the mystery of the cult until...you'll have to watch the movie, it is an ending for-the-ages. There really isn't any gore here, just a little-blood, so gorehounds won't like-it, but who cares? This is inverse-horror.",The Wicker Man
183,MovieDude1893,Burnt Offering,4,14 June 2007,"'The Wicker Man' is widely considered a horror film must see, I've heard it's climax mentioned along with the likes of 'Halloween'. I'm hear to tell you it barley can stack up against the like of Freddie's newest foray in to the land of sequel tedium. As a thriller it fails to thrill, as a musical (yes there is much music) it is out there and unenjoyable and as a horror story it is unremarkable.So many have said that this is a classic horror film, but I hated it. The only redeeming feature of this snoozer is the always reliable Christopher Lee. He provides the right amount of menace for his character, Lord Sumerisle. The story could also be filed under mystery. It chronicles the journey of a religious and strong principled investigator Sgt. Howie. He has been brought to the sleepy island of Sumerisle to investigate the disappearance of a young girl whom the locals say never existed. He soon uncovers scandalous secrets of town rituals. I know that this is a ""cult film"" but that is certainly one cult I'd stay away from.",The Wicker Man
184,Aditya_Gokhale,Wicked..!!,9,5 May 2009,"Robin Hardy's ""The Wicker Man"" has got to be 'the' most twisted and bizarre film from the early 70s..period! The plot doesn't take much time to pick up its steady pace..Sergeant Howie, a devout Christian, played brilliantly by Edward Woodward, receives an anonymous letter recommending that he undertake the investigation of the disappearance of a young girl from the remote island of Summerisle. He sets off on this task by leaving for the island. Once there, during his quest, little by little he uncovers what actually happened to the girl. What he learns leaves him as well as the viewer equally shocked and disturbed...Make no mistake, this is a truly great picture...with a fantastic screenplay by Anthony Shaffer, brilliantly directed by Robin Hardy. And then there's the already famous soundtrack by Paul Giovanni and Magnet, which consists of folk songs performed by the characters in the film. They are also aptly placed and great accompaniments fitting in well with the narrative in some of the key scenes in the film. Albeit, the ""low budget"" element shows..Harry Waxman's cinematography is not very crisp, but that's small potatoes.About the acting...Edward Woodward in the lead role is outstanding as Sergeant Howie. Christopher Lee delivers a fantastic performance as Lord Summerisle in one of the best roles of his career. Then there is Britt Ekland's unforgettable ""Willow""..and the other bunch of loony characters on the island...all make for some truly bizarre and memorable characters.It's a pity that the original release in Britain was massacred and reduced to a 87 minutes version..and to top it all, released as a B-picture on a double bill with ""Don't Look Now""! It is difficult to believe. It definitely deserved a bigger, independent initial release.However, this film has stood the test of time, and is now revered as a cult classic, more than 30 years after its release.It is sacrilege to miss this one...go for it!",The Wicker Man

186,a666333,Just not very interesting and not at all suspenseful,4,15 September 2020,"This review is of a 99 minute version of the movie.The ending will surprise some people. That is a point in its favour. At its time, it was possibly considered to be adventurous film-making. It is dated now although there is some shock value and strangeness at certain moments which will appeal to some people. It is not suspenseful, it is not scary. I would hesitate to call it a horror movie as many have.It is not erotic despite the nudity involving attractive women. All the nudity and attempts at being erotic are either gratuitous/surplus even non-sequitur or attempt to contribute to the strangeness/shock value without really succeeding. Leaving most of it out would have improved the movie.The plot is thin and simple. There is an anti-Christian aspect to it which was and is so common that it comes across as stock formula.The acting is nothing memorable although a few people succeed at coming across as suspicious. But when that is almost everyone, it doesn't mean much. Edward Woodward is good but his work is wasted. If the rest of the movie had been better constructed. his performance would have been elevated. Given the surrounding material, his work withers. Christopher Lee has a couple of short interesting moments and I understand that he likes his role in this movie but frankly, it doesn't add up to too much. Diane Cilento is effective but doesn't actually do much in total. Britt Ekland was there as a sexual object. Ingrid Pitt is a throw-in.I know it will appeal to some people which is why I elevated it to a 4 from the 2 or 3 that it probably more justly deserves.",The Wicker Man

But almost as soon as he arrives, he notices the towns people (Diane Cilento, Britt Ekland, Lindsay Kemp and more) and the town in total are way out of the usual.Okay, written on paper, this movie should be boring, and stupid. Naked people dance in the streets, men dress as women, and more wackiness! So how does it work so well? Anthony Shaffer (One of my all time favorite writers) just makes it work, with help of course from the wonderful actors and director.Although not mentioned on the IMDb genre list, I consider this movie to be partly... well, a musical. People randomly break out into song, usually in a sexual nature (sex and religion are the themes of this strange little masterpiece) but the music fits the movie perfectly.So for a neat little drama/thriller/horror/musical thats VERY well done, plop down and plop in The Wicker Man!",The Wicker Man
188,its-me6611,Enjoyed it but Midsommar is better.,7,6 December 2019,"7/10I have heard a lot about this film, good things. It is a well-made film. I enjoyed the first half more than the second half. I knew how it would end so that kind of made it less enjoyable than it should have been. Also I watched Midsommar which is a better film both in terms of visual and character.Plot: Sergeant Howie receives and anonymous letter saying that a girl is missing in a private island. Once there he is shocked by the degenerative behavior of the townsfolk also he suspects that the girl might have been murdered.The first part of the film is amazing. We have a Cristian devotee who is plunged into a world of old gods, superstitions and pagan rituals. The ideologies of the town's people and the sheer lack of concern over the missing child perplexes him. The way people of the town interacts him feels deliberate and feels almost as if they are taunting him, making a mockery of his religious belief. We see him praying at night and gradually being angry at the people around him. The way his character is shown is very interesting and I enjoyed it.In second part of the film, we are shown more bizarre side of the town and its people. By then I could feel the ultimate fate of our protagonist. Some scenes were really well made. I liked the dialogues. Songs were wonderful.I did not like the absence of horror element. There were no danger lurking, no tension. The film felt like a comedy, even during the end it did not had any horror feeling. The Midsommar is a much better film although I would recommend anyone who liked Midsommar to give it a watch.",The Wicker Man

Though I didn't like either version, I am impressed by this classic. It is good to see Howie stick to his Christian beliefs until the end, to see his torture as he discovers the community's pagan beliefs and their pagan gods and rituals. Howie is a good man, by the book, and cant believe there are people who still live like this. This version holds your attention as you see the struggle Howie is forced to endure at the hands of the people of Summersisle.",The Wicker Man

193,nickthegun,The last great British film,9,20 February 2003,"Seen by some as the last great British horror (maybe even the last great British film), the Wicker Man stands towering above the periods more camp attempts at the macabre.The film kicks off with straight laced copper, Edward Woodward, speeding towards Summerisle in his nifty little sea plane. He is a man on a mission. And this particular mission involves finding a missing girl.
Finding the locals particularly unhelpful (especially the girls mother) Woodward decides to stay the night on the island, in the local pub. And that's when things get weird. Woodwards character, an utterly devout christian, is somewhat perturbed by people having sex in graveyards, naked girls jumping through fire and children being force fed frogs. His faith is tested the most, though, by having Britt Ekland do a nude jig for him. These tests of faith help to set up a thrilling climax.The Wicker Man is superbly shot, the scenery is lovely and everything is well framed. The notion of this film being a musical never quite escapes you, due to the villagers bursting into song every 5 minutes, but adds to the quirkiness of the village.As most of you will probably watch this on DVD I might as well give a brief over view on that. The 2 disc pack comes with the print of the film most people will have seen and a second disc with an extended directors cut. The vanilla version has been cleaned up and looks very good. Lovely 5.1 surround and a great documentary which explains the how the film was badly treated by the studio and why it became such a cult hit. The second disc is where the action is at though. A directors cut'. Although whether it is a true directors cut' or not is debatable. The extra material fleshes out the story significantly, extending woodwards stay on the island by a day and explaining why he's there and expands Christopher Lees role significantly. The new material is sometimes of dubious quality (having been buried under a road for some years!) and the sound is nothing to write home about, but it is as close as you can possibly get to the director's vision.",The Wicker Man
194,montferrato,Overrated and Mediocre Film with a decent twist in the end,5,9 December 2014,"I have watched tonight this movie. I had good expectations, and i was very disappointed. The movie is full of pseudo hippie, new age stuff, with amateur guys and girls drinking and singing, playing guitars, and dancing naked and having sex in the new age island ruled by a freakish lord played by Cristopher Lee(too urbane to be credible, ridiculous hair). The islanders and their dances and rituals looked like a cheap Sunday pantomime done by amateurs at the local pub. The scene at the school, where the teacher is just teaching black magic as if they were just saying 2+2=4 made me jump from my chair and laugh. So bad¡¡¡¡ The actors are horrendous, including Lee. The plot is bad, and the script is poor. The director executes the movie very badly and poorly. The end is morbid and rather interesting, but it is very far from being the great thing people say. The wicker man is a mediocre movie with some touch of originality and a decent ending. That is why i give it a five. As for the people who give this movie a 10, they must be surely card carrying members of Lord Freakishland Islanders Cult promoting a pagan covert operation to grow apples in the minds of the IMDb readers¡¡¡ (LOL)",The Wicker Man
195,batzi8m1,Satanic Human Sacrifice Cult with Nekkid Bimbo Booty Shaking,9,9 November 1999,"OK.  I'll admit it was cheesy at some parts, esp. Willow's mating dance - heck she wouldn't have to pound the walls that hard to get my attention! But aside some of the elements were quite well done, and it was suspenseful and horrific in and anticipatory kind of way.No druids dispensing wisdom, no heroic cattle or woman stealing raids, just dark conspiracy.  This was done as a commercial film venture to make money. Notice that none of the respected folk rock bands of the era are represented -- no Fairport Convention or Pentangle.  This was a formula horror movie. And the horror was that the conspiracy against this self-righteous self-important uninvited do-gooder was plain as day but his devotion to his duty made him heroically and tragically persevere.  Remember, tragedy must be self-induced by a desire to play God, and this one follows the formulas.I couldn't help thinking, as I first watched this movie, how much this film owed to the tongue in cheek approach to B horror movies of that era.  By all means not a film for children, but if you are having one of those days where you get just sick of that variety of Christians who've never read a holy book not even their own, shoving their self righteous delusions into your unwilling face.... Better yet invite some Christians over to watch it, and serve them a roast suckling baby pig but don't eat any yourself; tell them you're a vegetarian but this baby piggy was sacrificed just for them...Honestly, this movie is about as close as this society can get to displaying a contemporary pagan society, and it does so with some cheesy self-satire. But the theme and lesson the imperialist west learned in that era is aptly portrayed by the inhabitants of the land of eternal summer, the Celtic euphemism for the land on the other side.

196,VictorianCushionCat,Best Brit Flick,10,17 January 2002,"The Wicker Man is one of my favorite British movies. Much of the film is rather amusing as Sgt Howie is ever more bemused and unsettled at the weird pagan ways of the islanders.  Seeking explanation for this from Lord Summerisle only serves to further this.
The ending is shocking and disturbing (especially on first viewing) This is perhaps partly because for much of the film the lifestyle on the island is portrayed in an not entirely negative light. The music is an surreal collection of tunes made to sound as if they are authentic.There is talk of a re-make, it might get seen by more people, but it surely wouldn't come close in terms of atmosphere.",The Wicker Man
197,ericdetrick2002,I wish there were more like this one...,10,11 May 2005,"While I site here and write how much I enjoyed this film, there are going to be people out there who just got back from watching ""The Ring 2"" meets ""The Grudge"" and will say, ""This isn't scary"". This is not a film that uses cheap overdone ""startle you"" moments to get scare points. In fact, to a degree this is not a horror movie at all. The only monsters are the ones called human beings.If you enjoy films that build up, seeing it from the point of view of the main character who is trying to figure out what the heck is going on- check this out. You find yourself thinking you know what is happening, then that idea gets shredded, and so on. I had to go back and delete a good portion of my comment I wrote about this film, not so much because it was a spoiler, but because I didn't want to plant any ideas about what I thought the film was doing. I had the pleasure of seeing this film with absolutely no idea what it was about. I didn't know if it was supposed to be scary, suspenseful, or dramatic.See this film. This is not a ""beer movie night"" film you watch with your drinking buddies. Watch it alone or with a few people who won't make comments and talk throughout the film. Let the atmosphere draw you in to the story. If you want blood, guts, and zombies- this isn't it- although I love a good gut munching film from time to time (ok, that's all I watch).

198,darioilg,"An interesting story about religion, less engaging as a mystery",8,6 August 2021,"""The Wicker Man"" is a fun mystery/thriller/horror story, but for the most part it drags on as the policeman protagonist tries to make sense of all the lies and deception of the islanders. There is one big twist towards the end which helps the first frustrating part where all questions are simply deflected.What makes this story really stand out among horror movies is its complex approach to religious belief. As a convinced atheist, I see it as the struggle between two equally deluded world-views, and it is particularly interesting to see how the policeman calls the islanders crazy for believing some supernatural creatures will save their crops when he calls for eternal life right before burning alive. It's a poetic image that not many directors would have the guts to film.",The Wicker Man
199,silva-w-pius,I cease to find the charm in this lacklustre bore fest.,6,21 March 2014,"Wicker Man is Robin Hardy's 1973 original, chronicling the tale of a police officer Neil Howie as he ventures into the remote Island or Hebridean, Summerisle, in hopes of discovering the whereabouts of a little girl among an island of freakish individuals, to say the least.Although usually physiological thrillers, may lack the jump out of your seat moments, but they make up for it by leaving you with a bone chilling sensation that haunts you to you down to the core, such in the likes of Silence of the Lambs and Rosemary's baby, but in this film it offer you neither jump out of your seat moments or bone chilling sensations, instead all it offers you is a snail's paced building climax, along the way filling your ears with pointless sing and dance numbers that even High School Musical would be embarrassed to have, although the only aspect I did find terrifying was the way the town folk where so heavily brainwashed that they lost all sense of individual thought or morality and behaved almost zombie like. Although the twist at the end wasn't actually that bad and slightly makes up for the boring precursor. What I also found annoying in The Wicker Man was the outrageously, sinfully bad dubbing that was extremely distracting and cringe inducing. The main character was also rather infuriating, I found him irritating and difficult to empathise with; although rather gallant in the face of a group of people seem to not to care about the disappearance of a little girl. What annoyed me most about him was the fact that during the earlier parts of the film, he rides into town he has never been before, upon his high horse and believing just because he is part of the law he automatically achieves almost god like status among the town folk, and uses it as an excuse to constantly speak to them through snide remarks and impatient demands.It seems the internet is filled with admirers of this horror flick, but I cease to find the charm in this lacklustre bore fest. I strongly beg you not to waste your time watching it; you will probably find more scares in an episode of Goose bumps, than you would in this mess. But on a positive note, at least it's better than the American 2006 remake.",The Wicker Man
200,HSauer,Truly horrifying,10,14 November 1999,"It seems that many people hate this film and/or find it ridiculous.  I think it's a great story, the execution of which may falter in spots (particularly in the wardrobe department), but not so as to detract from the overall effect.  [WARNING:  POSSIBLE SPOILER]  Viewers who find ""holes"" in the plot frankly do not understand what is happening to Sgt. Howie and what the islanders are doing.  The Sgt. is extremely important to the islanders and they can devote all their energy and guile towards seeing him carry out Lord Summerisle's design.  They have nothing better to do; perhaps nothing else to do.  The Sgt., for his part, has been invited to Summerisle, and believes it's his part to solve a mystery presented to him.  There's no way he can get ""search warrants"" before May Day, and the islanders are offering more and more evidence of complicity in a shocking crime he must prevent, if possible.  So the Sgt.'s professional improprieties must be weighed against the need for him to act fast, as well as alone.    Everything that seems ironic or too coincidental for belief (another criticism of the film) is explained by the fact that the islanders have a plan for Sgt. Howie.  He needs to be led - pulled along by the nose - to a specific conclusion in a short time.  In sum, the plot makes perfect sense and proceeds in a deliberate way to its horrifying conclusion.  Lord Summerisle is a swine, of course, and manipulates everyone to save his own skin.  It can't happen here?  Maybe not.  The pagan elements are particularized so that the film shouldn't offend ""pagans"" in general; the Summerisle theology is a patchwork of ideas culled from thousands of years of non-Christian history, presumably to include those notions most profitable to Lord Summerisle and the locality.  We don't know how the islanders behave when Sgt. Howie isn't around.  Perhaps everything - family names & relationships on Summerisle, for instance - are put-on for his benefit (certainly the film involves enough paranoia to suggest such a fact).  Who could believe that Britt Ekland is really the landlord's daughter, after seeing the two of them together?  The social structure of the island may have been cobbled together in a few hours by a drunken Lord Summerisle and his lovely schoolteacher/friend, and put in place just in time for the Sgt.'s arrival.  What makes the film so much fun is that we learn the Sgt.'s fate before he does, without learning exactly how the story will be resolved.  So there's a conspiracy - what's the point of the conspiracy?  The answer we learn in the final fifteen minutes, which are utterly perfect!",The Wicker Man

Everything he finds out about the people there and the lives they lead convinces him that she has been sacrificed in some sort of Pagan ritual.  Great, unexpected ending.

202,Vastarien202,Beautiful and haunting,9,19 October 2005,"There is a reason why this film continues to stand out nearly 30 years after it was made. The atmosphere is timeless, the story compelling, and the music joins everything into a seamless whole. There is no single classification for Wicker Man; it's a murder mystery, a thriller, a musical, and a kind of ""what-might-have-been"". The result is shocking, sad, and even wistful. To tag it purely as ""Horror"" is nothing less than an insult.The story begins with a policeman getting a letter, in which he is asked for his help in finding a little girl. The village she vanished from is located on a remote Scottish island.When the policeman arrives, he is greeted with indifference, suspicion, and outright hostility. His reaction to the practices and faith of the villagers is nothing short of indignant rage and puritanical snobbery. The two forces at play drive the story along in unexpected directions, well-spiced with traditional songs which further illuminate the tale.It must be said that Christopher Lee's performance as Lord Summerisle is nothing short of brilliant. He did not steal the film, but he made it much more believable. With all the glory heaped upon this film, it remains one of those which has no middle ground; either you will love it, or you will hate it. The only thing the factions DO agree on is that the re-make with Cage was a festering pustule and never should have been allowed to exist, much less sully the reputation of this gem of cinema.You owe it to yourself to see this film at least once, especially with a Pagan friend. They will have some interesting insights.",The Wicker Man
203,eminges,The first movie rated NC-17 for ideology,10,12 June 2001,"One of the other viewers nailed it perfectly: subversive.  This is the movie that challenges the very moral and intellectual foundations of modern Western civilization AND features Britt Ekland doing the nasty with a blank wall.  Perfect fare for your anglophile friends who think Easter egg hunts on the church lawn are cute, and can't understand why Father Hugh is so dead-set against having a maypole dance at the spring picnic.
Yes, it's going to take at least three viewings before you appreciate just how deep and finely constructed this low-budget quickie really is.  Shaffer starts laying traps for Edward Woodward (and us) on the first page of the script, and until you've seen this twice or three times you won't understand just how inescapable Sergeant Howie's fate really is.  And then you can see all the better that nobody but Edward Woodward could have brought it off without looking like a complete jackass.And Christopher Lee should have gotten an Oscar, an Emmy, AND a Tony for his reading of three words: ""He blew it.""

205,campbell-russell-a,A journey of the mind.,10,23 January 2014,"When Sgt. Howie leaves for Summerisle, we are taken with him on a journey of the mind back to rituals and attitudes that were rooted in the reverence and supplication of nature. Howie steadfastly resists the temptation to immerse himself in the sensual and sometimes sexual abandonment of the locals but I am sure that most viewers, no matter whether they are religious or not,find it difficult not to be seduced - at least a little. This is part of the brilliance of the film. The music is beguiling - perhaps the best soundtrack in any film. The acting is utterly convincing. The rites are performed with such belief and passion. The final ideological duel between Howie as he sings a psalm in opposition to the locals as they swing back and forth whilst singing ""Summer is A'Coming In"" as the wicker-man burns is perhaps the most striking and thought-provoking conclusion to any film. The film is a mixture of mystery/horror/thriller but ultimately a challenge to any person who wishes to look back from whence we came with our beliefs and rituals.",The Wicker Man
206,quatermax-1,"An atmospheric, unique and memorable film...",7,8 February 2008,"If you've never seen or heard of The Wicker Man you're obviously an inhabitant of some remote island not dissimilar to that featured in the film, a Scottish isle upon which lands our hapless hero, Sergeant Howie (Edward Woodward), a mainland copper in search of a reported missing child. ""Have you lost your bearings?"" ask the islanders on his arrival, and, considering the mess he gets into during the course of the story, he obviously had. Howie, you see, is a devout and still virginal god-fearing Presbyterian. He practises his religion as he does his job  strictly by the book (or The Book) and is appalled to discover that the island's community is still practising pagan rituals, and even worse, still teaching these rituals in the local school. So now, as well as conducting his investigation, he also feels duty bound to lead these heathens on to the path of righteousness. Thus begins a cat and mouse game as Howie pointlessly tries to pit his wits, and his religion, against the passive yet manipulative islanders, led by the charismatic Lord Summerisle (Christopher Lee), who are completely in control of their environment, whereas he is a man alone, a fish completely out of water, in a place where mainland laws, and his own Christian beliefs, no longer apply, his only companions being his Bible and his God.Sounds heavy doesn't it? And so it is eventually, but in the meantime we are treated to a nice travelogue of a fictitious Scottish island community, accompanied by a Celtic folk music soundtrack (no other score is involved), that yet has a simmering threat forever in the background. Howie is witness to several blasphemous goings on that you certainly wouldn't organise as part of a church fete, he is given the runaround by the villagers in his search for the child, and even his own chastity is put to the test by the pub-cum-guesthouse landlord's daughter (a dubbed Britt Ekland).Arguably a problem with the film is that Howie is not a bloke you'd get along with. He's not likable. In fact he's a pain in the arse. He is as much a zealot in his own beliefs as the islanders are believers in theirs. Also they enjoy their religion, barbaric as it sometimes transpires to be, whilst he is almost puritanically strapped into a straightjacket and almost flagellates himself with his in such a blinkered, intransigent and intolerant way that you can't help feeling that in the end he gets everything that's coming to him. But of course this is the ambiguity of the film  Who's side, in the end, do you find yourself on? But of course, that's for you to decide. Or not.The UK DVD release features two versions of the film: the theatrical version of the movie running at 84 mins, and also the extended ""Director's Cut"" running at 99 mins. The extra footage (easily spotted by the change in picture quality as it has been sourced from an original 1"" analogue telecine master 'the best element known to exist') includes scenes on the mainland before Howie leaves for the island (and consequently different opening titles) and which establish early on his anally retentive character; more footage of Lord Summerisle which develops his character and influence on the islanders a little more, and footage which establishes more clearly that Howie actually spends two nights on the island, not one, which is a little vague in the original theatrical release (or one of them  let the purists rant!).The special features include a theatrical trailer; TV and radio spots, a 25 minute American TV interview with Christopher Lee and director Robin Hardy and a 35 minute documentary 'The Wicker Man Enigma'. The animated menus are also beautifully presented with each scene selection panel featuring footage from that scene. There are also talent biographies and a special CD Rom feature providing you with the original Theatrical Press Brochure for the film. Also, exclusive to the UK release, there is a full-length commentary (on the Director's Cut version) by Edward Woodward, Christopher Lee and Robin Hardy, and moderated by British film broadcaster Mark Kermode. Mostly it's very informative, but Christopher Lee comes across as such a bolshie individual, perhaps it's his age. He keeps trying to dominate the conversation with poor director Robin Hardy eventually managing to cut in with 'Would you like me to tell you what really happened?' with Lee indignantly responding with 'Well I don't remember it being like that at all...' and also deliberately cutting the others off in mid-flow with lines like 'Can I just point out that that chap on the left worked in the Glasgow Hippodrome...' and then going off on another tangent. Then he keeps harping on about how disgraceful it was that the 'greatest British movie of all time' was deliberately hacked to pieces by the distributors, something he goes back to again and again in his best, brooding, ominous curse-ridden tones straight out of Lord of the Rings. He may well be right but hey, Chris, we got the point the first time you ranted about it. Add to that some of Robin Hardy's comments, which are often vague, confused and contradictory, and which set the ball rolling back into Lee's court again. Edward Woodward meanwhile tries uneasily to keep the mood a little lighter, change the subject and not lose his cool. Mark Kermode does well to keep it moving and in check. If you listen between the lines it's actually very entertaining.

A genuine believable horror story. No special effects, a great script, fine performances, limited budget . Just about every box that needs to be ticked in a horror film was included. A haunting scene with folk music is one of the films most memorable moments. A cracking ending, with Christoper Lee in fine form, it is a work that cannot be praised highly enough.Another positive no stupid comedy scenes to wreck the flow and build up of tension as the film progresses. Why oh why cannot horror film makers produce work like this, instead of the unimaginative effect ridden slasher scenes with teens, in so many productions today.",The Wicker Man

Action adventure?  Hardly.  I think this gives the film its unique feel and is the reason I love watching it.  The ending is a surprise the first time you see the film, but it still shocks after many viewings too.  I don't agree with the comments on here about the music, it is just another of the quirks that gives the film atmosphere.

215,stephparsons,Frosty policeman meets island of free loving pagans!,7,13 July 2013,"Wowzers!! I was totally unprepared for the goings on in this movie and thought I'd be settling down to an old, predictable, 'horror' - how wrong I was. The Wicker Man, written by Anthony Shaffer and directed by Robin Hardy, is so bizarre and yet so cunningly clever, it's a truly worthy cinematic experience. Sergeant Howie (played adeptly by Edward Woodward) sets off to a remote Scottish Island to follow up on a 'missing child' case, having received a letter from one of the islanders about her disappearance. Right from the get go we are treated to the outlandish ways of the island folk and let's just say, the straight laced Howie is not exactly welcomed with open arms. It soon becomes apparent that the islanders actively pursue a pagan belief system and are immersed in an unusual lifestyle that involves the worship of nature and pagan Celtic gods, and an open reverence for fecundity, sexuality and fertility - this totally outrages the conventional, god-fearing Sergeant and the more he sees, the more frustrated and irritated he becomes. Imagine his horror at the continual cavorting, sudden bursts of jaunty folk music , and elaborate (and somewhat explicit) fertility rites.As Howie goes about his business he soon finds, much to his chagrin, that no one is willing to help him in his quest to find the missing girl and that no one will even openly admit to knowing her. This stonewalling, combined with his continual exposure to the islanders' hedonism, just compounds his intolerance and revulsion which I believe is neatly summed up when he hollers at the top of his lungs 'Heathens!, bloody heathens!'. He quickly learns that all residents of Summerisle (including himself) must defer to the charismatic Lord Summerisle (played with panache by Christopher Lee) and although this 'leader' isn't 'worshipped' as such, it is evident that he 'runs the show'.The artful depiction of ancient British customs, celebrations and costumes are a huge component of Wicker Man, not to mention the islanders' random eruptions into bawdy folk songs. The movie appears to have been casted with a range of unskilled, 'wooden' actors who are not altogether believable and seem big on 'over acting' but, as the plot unfolds, you may well change your opinion as to their 'acting skills'. There are though, without doubt, some genuinely bad actors and some painful attempts at the Scottish accent (apparently the Landlord's daughter's 'accent' was so heinous they ended up dubbing her lines). There are also many seemingly over the top, and obvious, metaphors (think: dead child cakes, numerous phallic symbols, dead hare in a casket, lingering shots of the sun etc).After initially sympathizing with Sergeant Howie and the way he is ridiculed and lied to by the wilfully uncooperative islanders, one begins to finds his staunch, prudish, celibate and rigid brand of Christianity somewhat objectionable, and his intolerance of the islander's customs and beliefs, particularly narrow minded. The juxtaposition of Howie's 'god fearing' ways and the islanders ebullient and, on face value, 'cheerful' worship of nature, is cleverly enacted but, as the movie plays out, the portrayal of these contrary beliefs beg questions such as, is this an indictment of religion (including but not necessarily limited to the Sergeant's and the islanders)? Is it solely an indictment of paganism? Is it pro Christian and anti heathen? And, if that last theory applies, why wasn't Howie depicted in a more sympathetic light? Other interesting elements of the movie include the fact everything we are presented with is seen only through the eyes of Howie so one does start to wonder if his biased, prejudiced view of the pagan folks actually colours what he (and in turn we) see. This notion is exemplified when the Sergeant is in his room at the inn and, in the next room, the Landlord's daughter is stark naked, dancing around in a highly suggestive manner and repeatedly slapping the wall (yes.. that bit was weird). Howie leans up against the wall and you see his perspiration and pained expression of unfulfilled desire as he battles with this 'sinful' temptation. However, you then realize that a) he didn't know she was naked, and b) he didn't know there was 'dirty dancing' going on. Was it all just a figment of his imagination? And if so, how much else of what he saw on that island was conjured up by his mind's eye?.In conclusion, if you want to watch a well thought out, creative, totally non-generic movie that may generate much discussion - and if you appreciate strange, off the wall and sometimes bizarre film-making - oh yes, and if you can handle an eyeful of naked, nubile young women prancing and dancing around - you're gonna love it!",The Wicker Man
216,jmrecillas-83435,An impressive masterpiece retelling of The Bacchae and Eleusis rites,10,3 September 2018,"I think this is the most impressive and fascinating retelling/adaptation from two great anquiquet Greek cult issues. Euripide's The Bacchae and the Eleusis rites, both minor and major rites. In that sense, this is more than a thriller or a horror movie, and that is wath it makes so unique, so special, and so impressive. In that way we have to understand what all the people call ""pagan cult"". The symbolism of Eleusis rites appears since the arrival to the island and all wath happen. Is not a casual thing that the island calls Summerisland, and that the future victim, Sergeant Neil Howie, need to come by his own will to be part ot a voluntary sacrifice, instead of beign abducted. Agrarian symbolism includes the way in Summerisland beer is made, and all the film atmosphere always remember us that is an island basically full of young girls, who seduce the newcomer in order to conducted to his ritual sacrifice, exactly as happen with Pentheus, who want to know the name and the rites of the new arrival god, Dyonisus, who needs the sacrifice in order to succeed. In the Teban myth, girls on an island sacrifice Pentheus, exactly as in film Sergeant Neil Howie is finally burnt out on an agrarian rite of purification.A supreme masterpiece that goes beyond conventional film genres. One of the greatest british films ever, in my opinion. A must see!",The Wicker Man
217,xterminal,It grows on you...,9,27 December 2000,"The Wicker Man (Robin Hardy, 1973)I have to revise my original review of this film-- though, from checking every archive I can find, I'm not sure I WROTE a review of this film after first seeing it. This could turn out to be a good thing, because my original feeling for it was ""what the hell was all the fuss about,"" and after finding out that, yes, I had seen the original uncut version, my confusion deepened.Well, it's been eight months or so since then, and the thing's crept into my consciousness. Repeated viewings have had exactly the same effect they had with Argento's masterpiece Suspiria, to wit:viewing #1: what the hell was all the fuss about? viewing #2: I can see where there are some points made and subtexts in this film that would greatly appeal to the people who held this thing up in such high regard to me, and Ed Woodward and Chris Lee are very fine actors (and Britt Ekland unclothed is always worthwhile), but it's still kind of, forgive the pun, wooden. viewing #3: My god, this is a profound film. viewing #4: Why hasn't the rest of the world clued into how great this is? (Probably because it was so badly mangled in its original release that it left a bad taste in the mouths of many, from what I've been told.)This film was the directorial debut of Robin Hardy, who has since gone on to direct only one other film and a few episodes of a TV series (read: mysterious shadowy figure). It was the brainchild of Anthony Shaffer, a name that should be well known to all film buffs (Frenzy, Sleuth, Death on the Nile, Sommersby, et al.). It stars Edward Woodward, already a veteran TV actor by the early seventies, as the uptight Sergeant Howie, a Scottish constable who decides to investigate an anonymous tip-off that a thirteen-year-old girl named Rowan Morrison has been abducted on a small island famous for its apples. Howie's nemesis, Lord Summerisle (Christopher Lee looking surprisingly young, given that he was over fifty when he played this role), flits in and out of the film, dropping hints that all is not, perhaps, as it seems, but offering all the help he can given that Howie doesn't seem to understand that police procedure doesn't have to go by the book. After all, you can only offer someone so much help if he doesn't see where you're going with it.Yes, there are a lot of things about this film, on the surface, that could have been done better. It was obviously made on a shoestring budget that didn't have room for a Steadicam or top-quality film. Unfortunately, that leads to unconscious links about other things in the film that are supposed to look primitive (the islanders' costumes for the Mayday celebration, for example), and the first-time viewer tends to knock the film for things that should be praised because of it.As for the content of the film itself, the acting is, as one would expect from names like Woodward, Lee, and Ekland, easily above average. The plot moves along quite effortlessly, and the underlying subtext, while strongly presented, never gets in the way of a bang-up mystery (and while the ending becomes somewhat obvious about two-thirds of the way through the film, by then you've realized that the resolution to the mystery isn't what this film is about at all, and you-- or at least I-- become willing to cut Shaffer and Hardy a lot of slack). The scenery-- and no, you dirty-minded little nappers, I'm not talking about Britt Ekland's infamous naked dance-- is breathtaking, from the opening credits panning over Howie's district, to the very end. ""But,"" you're saying, ""all of these things are true about many other films that have probably been forgotten thirty years after they were made."" True. And what keeps The Wicker Man firmly entrenched in the heads of so many, I'd warrant, is the gorgeous and profoundly influential soundtrack to this film. The main theme (which is untitled, but for years I've heard it referred to as ""The Wicker Man Song;"" Sneaker Pimps released a version of it in 1997 with the title ""How Do"") is rapidly becoming one of the world's most covered songs, and all the songs in the film are extremely well executed. (Also in the ""mysterious shadowy figure"" vein, composer Paul Giovanni never scored another film.) I've no idea whether these songs were written especially for the film or whether they're traditional, and I can't find a single Internet resource capable of telling me, but this film is worth buying simply for the music. The rest will come to you. Trust me on this. Christopher Lee-- who holds the record of having been in more films than anyone else (ever!)-- considers The Wicker Man his finest work. I haven't seen everything Christopher Lee's ever been in (I'm not sure there's a living soul aside from Lee himself who has!), but I'd have to agree with him based on what I've seen. Once The Wicker Man has you, it has you for life. **** 1/2(Note: the film has presently been verified in release in three versions: 87 minutes, 95 minutes, and 102 minutes, with the 102 minute version considered the ""uncut"" version, which is selling for close to $100 in many places. Don't believe the hype-- I got mine for $12 on ebay. It is rumored that a full version of the film, which runs 122 minutes, DOES exist somewhere and has never been released.)",The Wicker Man
218,madsmartinussen,More musical than horror,3,20 April 2021,"While watching this film I thought to myself ""Well, it's before my time, maybe this is what constituted scary in '73 and I just don't get it?"".. Then I remembered that 'The Exorcist' came out that same year and, by god, 'Psycho' came out 13 years earlier. How this film is ranked as one of the all time horror greats is beyond me. It's more musical than horror. I suppose it's a great little mystery for it's time, even in some respects a thriller, and I recognize the fact that the reason it came off as predictable, is because it's influenced a lot of later films. So I'll give it that, but nothing more, this movie is NOT scary, it is by no conceivable means shocking, unless (as other reviewers have pointed out well before me) you are somehow shocked and appalled by naked women and people not believing in god, and basically half the movie is hippies singing old folky songs. I was bored, and if it wasn't for the promise of a great big horrific ending, I would have quit within 15-20 minutes. Oh and as for the ending, I've seen Disney pictures more terrifying!

219,Turin_Horse,"Hippies, paganism, police investigation, a bit of horror and a lot of humor",8,17 April 2015,"I was very surprised by this film, in a positive way. I expected some kind of cannibal holocaust, wild cruel rites in some dark and remote African, Amazonian or New Guinea settlement. Far from it, we are in a Scottish offshore island, and about to meet a community of neopagans who live happily a rather free and morally relaxed style of life following old pagan rites mixed with Scottish traditions, and spiced with traditional folk music; hippies of the 60's-70's would have loved to live there! Technically the film has its flaws, but the last scene offers something very original which we have hardly ever watched in cinema. Forget about its classification as a ""horror film"", it is not, actually there are many more moments for laugh than frightening ones, yet an atmosphere of mystery is present throughout the film.The plot is essentially a mystery about the disappearance of a girl from the community, the investigation of a just arrived policeman, and the lack of cooperation from the dwellers. There is a very interesting final twist, just before the remarkable last scene.But there is more it. The film contains several layers actually, and below the surface there is a very interesting clash of religious beliefs, and a reflection on the role religion and believing in the supernatural plays in the society (be it the promise of an afterlife made by someone who died in a cross or the belief in reincarnation on the grounds of the natural cycle of life and the gods that govern it all). It was my impression that neither of both are given much credit in the film, so maybe it does contain some kind of subtle atheistic message.In summary, a highly recommended film. The fact that there has been two recent remakes of it (both failed attending to the opinions of IMDb's reviewers) is indicative of the interest and influence The Wicker Man still conserves three decades later.",The Wicker Man

221,mikeg994,March Hares and Paganism,9,25 November 2008,"If you haven't seen the film then by no means read this review, since knowing the ending beforehand largely spoils the effect. However for those of you who have seen it or know the story, here goes:This was an excellent film and part of its excellence was its upending of so many movie clichés. One huge cliché is that the hero of the piece, (Edward Woodward) could take on an army and win against outrageous odds. The hero is quite literally toast and that comes as a complete surprise to those who have no inkling of how it ends. The viewer is teased into thinking he is going to be smashed on the rocks below but an even more horrifying ending is in store as the title character, not seen until the last minute or two of the film finally appears. One might, based on so many other films one has seen, expect that the SWAT team would arrive by parachute and put the fire out and arrest all concerned. That this does not happen is about as gripping an ending as one could devise. The amiable and gentle folk of the island have all gone collectively bonkers and it isn't just from an excess of drinking. And how many old inbred aristocrats such as played by Christopher Lee have we read, seen, or heard about? Well-bred, high born, and flat out insane? Islands of course are famous in literature for being dens of wickedness hidden from the view of the larger world. From Papillion to Lord of the Flies to Jurassic Park, they are special, rather magical places and this one is no different. At the same time it makes paganism look like fun. There is a delightful playfulness in the spirit of the islanders. It seems almost a satire on the clash between paganism and the early missionaries of the Church. The music is wonderful. One wonders if there was ever a sound track album that came out of this film. It seemed at certain points on the verge of becoming a musical, a musical horror film the likes of which had never been seen before Sweeny Todd.The cultish eroticism in the film did not distract from the story and did not seem in the end, gratuitous although it might have easily been so. There was a kind of sixties flavor to the weirdness, when people went native and dropped out, adopting very strange ideas indeed. One thinks of Charles Manson, Jonestown, Scientology, and Heaven's gate. How anyone could have hoped to remake this classic adequately is beyond me.",The Wicker Man

He suspects foul play (e.g. that the girl will be offered up as a human sacrifice) and tries to get to the bottom of theislander's secret. This film, generally categorized as a horror film, is more of a mystery and thriller. Since its release it has gained a cult status (and I can see why). It is very different and unique, combining elements of mystery, eroticism, and even a musical. It's also the most authentic depiction of paganism in film that I've seen.

224,SilkTork,Cult Rather Than Classic,4,30 June 2004,"Having seen this film years ago, but only remembering a rather dull and simplistic movie with a stunning ending, I have been curious over the years to hear of people who regard it as a classic. I borrowed a copy from my son, then settled down to see what the fuss was about. The opening sequence really sets the scene for what is about to unfold - a very tedious solo flight to the island. This sequence does nothing except to provide a background for the opening credits. It's slow, boring and meaningless. The film starts when the plane lands at the island and Woodward's character begins to interact coldly with the islanders. Yes, he is sure of his convictions and his authority, even though he is often told that he is not the authority he believes himself to be. But I don't care. I don't care for his personality, nor his assumed authority, nor the simplistic approach Shaffer and Hardy have adopted to this symbol of blinkered Christian religion. I don't care for the clumsy speeches about religion, belief and morality - they never come over as natural dialogue , but as bits of cheap philosophy inserted baldly into the script. The brooding atmosphere of a ""reasoned"" man against a secretive and primitive community is present, but never fully developed. As the viewer I'm not sure who it is I'm identifying with - and that may be part of the film's appeal for many, but for me it leaves an emotional gap for which the cheap philosophy never fully fills. The shock of the first musical number, when the pub bursts into a bawdy song about the landlord's daughter is accidental amusing rather than skillfully handled. The erotic scenes outside the pub are odd, daft and laughable. When these are followed by the landlord's daughter's attempt to seduce the dour policeman by dancing naked in the next room - a room into which he cannot see - the film really starts to fall apart. The landlord's character is so badly Hammer horror funny that he can be spotted in many a horror film spoof. Yes, I can see people watching this to laugh at the ineptitude of it all. The sweet shop owner pops a frog into the mouth of her daughter to cure a bad throat, then asks the policeman if she can help him, to which he storms out shouting ""No, I doubt it, seeing you're all raving mad!"" Yes. A few drinks and a few friends and this film becomes an outrageous comedy. Wait until you see Christopher Lee! He gives a very assured performance - indubitably his best - it's just a shame that his blow dried hair and paedophile  manner undermines everything he says and does. The plotline is simplistic - a plod toward the discovery of why the policeman has been called to the island. It provides little side interest, little meaningful character interaction, simply a slow trudge toward the inevitable climax. There are no real people in this story. No real life. No ideas worth paying attention to. And no emotion. All this film has is a dramatic closing sequence. If you want to see the main point of the film - read a quick plot summary, then simply watch the ending. The rest of it is just too daft to take seriously.",The Wicker Man

Now before I carry on, I ain't picking on other styles of horror I am stating a point.  One other thing I like about English horrors is the endings.  There's always some fancy twist that screws with your mind.To the film...Christopher Lee...Superb.  Probably his greatest role.  He plays the role so well.  The film dabbles into paganism which adds the element of fear.  This works particularly well as most horror's do in relation to this subject.  There is also this weird crazy element about the film which gives the viewer the sense of the unknowing.  I also believe that the director wants us to be Edward Woodward in this film.  It treats us as it does him.  When watch I'll think you'll understand my meaning.I also read somewhere that some people class this film as a MUSICAL. Shocked, I read this theory and eventually agree with it.  It might be hard to see but why can't a horror film be a musical.  The songs are a little crazy but they have a kind of magic about them.

I am actually more annoyed by the film than I like it. Because I see a huge opportunity missed here. This film could have been a great criticism of religions. But instead, it chooses the opposite almost. Although it is never spelled directly, our protagonist is portrayed as a moral model, thus Christianity as the true religion as opposed to paganism. In one scene, our good christian policeman, fully uniformed in his officers, scatters some pagan symbolism or offering in anger, then proceeds to create a makeshift cross from some pieces of wood on the same altar. How dumb! It could have really been a masterpiece if its message had matched its weirdness. One other major flaw of the film is that the protagonists behaviour doesn't match the situations that he is in. He was in numerous instances that he should have been alarmed and felt thereatened and unsafe. But he chooses to peacefully sleep when a lot of suspicious things going on around him, instead of trying to call for help. Again, dumb! And when I say dumb, I don't mean the character, he is dumb too of course, as a result. But at the end, the filmed served its purpose as a horror movie and it is really a different and weird film, I can't complain about any clichés and that is saying a lot when it's the horror genre.

He follows many scattered breadcrumbs throughout the film and eventually realizes that he was trapped all along with no one to comfort or save him.This film was enjoyable because we, as an audience, were with the police sergeant throughout the entire feature. We knew only what he knew and were as baffled as he was with the strange ways of the village; such as the exceedingly inappropriate discussion at the local school, the animal masks that are worn frequently and the naked girls dancing and singing over a bonfire.With the horror occurring in the daytime, in front of an entire community and in a nice village (that you may even go to for your holidays), this film throws you off the scent with its many anti-conventions. The stereotypes of the genre are almost completely overthrown to create this twisted, terrifying piece of cinema.The final scene was particularly horrific; ending with the Sergeant Howie burning to death as a sacrifice in the Wicker Man. Reminiscent of the death of Jesus Christ, Howie sings praises to God and prays to be saved as he is burned to death - one man against many. This is a sad, yet powerful ending - again using the anti-conventions in the sense that the villains won this time.I strongly recommend seeing this film. Christopher Lee himself said that his role as Lord Summerisle was one of the best roles he had ever had.",The Wicker Man
233,cathalokane,One of the greats,9,17 January 2014,"The Wicker Man is a very affecting film. It is one of the few films that you encounter that genuinely transports you to another world, a world where a conventional Scottish Catholic is a strange alien creature, and a creature to be hunted.I won't reveal any details of the plot in this review but it's a film that is loaded with atmosphere - it literally oozes menace from a very early stage. Viewers who are expecting to be ""entertained"" with explosions and car chases will walk away unsatisfied, and those coming here expecting a conventional ""horror"" will be confused. There are no supernatural aspects to this film over and above the imaginings of the human mind. There are few moments designed to make you jump in the manner of a conventional horror - that is not what this film is about.This is a story of tribalism, religion, deadly group superstition and a devastating parable of the dangers of what can happen when groups of humans agree on fanciful explanations on the nature of reality.The acting isn't mind blowing, and the film does look its age, but none of these things really seriously matter. It's all about the atmosphere, and the isolation and this is portrayed amazingly well by the way the piece is structured, the cinematography and the wonderful music.All in all, this is a wonderful film, that will both fascinate and shock. Not everyone will like it, but it certainly ranks, for me, as one of the greatest films of all time. Many of the films that are made today are singularly incapable of capturing the imagination in the way this film does as it's difficult to imagine such an isolated community existing in our globalised world - and that's part of the magic of this tale. It's believable and if you let yourself go with it, it's a shocking and disturbing piece of cinema.A must see for anyone seriously interested in film.",The Wicker Man
234,weekly-movie-review,The Wicker Man takes place on a remote island of England as a detective investigates the disappearance of a young girl...,7,19 December 2008,"The Wicker Man takes place on a remote island of England as a detective investigates the disappearance of a young girl. Immediately upon arrival, it becomes quite clear that he or anyone else is not at all welcome. The people and their island become more and more strange the longer he stays and the more questions he asks. This horror flick is a bit oddball, but the oddity is well worth it. Although not as good as I had hoped, there are many times during the watch that my eyes grew large and my jaw dropped to the floor. It is indeed a very eerie and strange movie. Think of it as a lesser quality Rosemary's Baby in the sense that a small community of wackos are out to get the only sane person left. Britt Eklund plays the evil seductress, if you will, and does quite a good job. The costume designs and setting are creepy in themselves, but props must go to the props (sorry for the pun), as the wicker man himself has remained the vaunting symbol of the movie for decades. Considered a cult classic about the occult, this film is sure to raise an eyebrow or two and is worth the time for those looking for something different.",The Wicker Man
235,sibelian,Um. Hm. No.,5,27 September 2006,"Actually, it's, er, not that great.Oh, okay, when I saw when I was a little kid the shock ending was really shocking and the whole build-up and stuff was reasonably interesting and affecting, particularly Britt Eckland's pretty yet creeeeepy seduction song....All the creepiness of the villagers, however, wasn't creepy at all when I saw it again recently, in fact they were so much nicer than Edward Woodward that I had pretty much no problem with them setting him on fire at all. I know, this is bad. This, coupled with the fact that I had already seen the movie when I was young, meant that the best bit, the shock ending, was neither a shock, nor particularly emotionally affecting in any *other* way. Which I didn't expect. After all, this is supposed to be a horror classic.When the schoolteacher at the end of the movie says: ""You shall be *revered* and *anointed* as a king"" along with a neat, confirmatory nod of the chin to indicate the ceremonial appropriateness of this anointing, she could just as easily have been saying: ""You shall be *ritually burned alive* for being *irritating* public nuisance"" and it would have been just as good.Not that I'm advocating copper-torching. Far from it. It's just that the islanders come across as so ordinary and pleasant that the ending, far from being a horrendous shock, just looks... fake. Edward Woodward acts his little heart out, but everyone else looks like extras.Also, I have an ambivalence about the film's basic premise. As an adult I couldn't really take the film seriously as I regularly visit the Scottish islands and the idea of paganism bursting into bloom in a hundred or so years to the intensity necessary for this movie's plot seems now to be a dim-witted idea, much MUCH more dim-witted than it seemed when I was young. The Scottish Islands, particularly the far out, far up ones, are DEEPLY Christian. Although I suppose you could postulate that it's the depth of religion itself, whatever it is, that hangs around those distant beaches and mountains. Certainly they are soul-stirring places... Meh. Dunno. That spiritual aura is there in the islands themselves, and the movie seems to tell of it a little in the images and music... but going there in reality is better.I do rather like Christopher Lee's little speech about animals. That was well-written, and, though very much of the time, contained sentiments that one might keep close to one's heart without *too* much danger of developing a law-enforcement officer incineration tendency, I would hope.5 stars. 1 for the acting, which *was* good, very good in places, 1 for Christopher Lee's little speech about animals, 1 for Britt Eckland's dirty dancing and the nice song, which I like (that sequence wasn't half as daft in 2006 as I expected it to be), ermmm... 1 for Christopher Lee himself, who does pull his bit off wonderfully, and 1 for...... well, cough, I suppose a conglomerate of May Morrison, the Harbour Master and the daft gravedigger, actually no, he was behaving like he was in a ""Wicker Man"" parody, er... say the schoolteacher...There. 5.

How well you enjoy this movie depends on whether you can reach that state of acceptance, given the weak production values and the odd pacing and the odd way the (odd) music is incorporated into the movie. First time I saw it, I started out thinking it was serious as Sgt.

242,harry-austin,True cult classic.,9,1 May 2011,"This should be ranked within the top ten films of the 1970s, and it is a great shame that it is not widely known as a film. I am amazed that it has not been broadcast on the BBC, and if it was re-released at the cinema, people would flock to watch it.I originally wanted to watch this film purely because Christopher Lee stared in it as the eerily charming Lord Summerilse. After seeing him in his more recent films, I wanted to watch his earlier films that brought him to the forefront of the acting world. After watching 'The Wicker Man', I felt that it has certainly exceeded my expectations.I think that this has been said before in other reviews, but I found the film to be very believable. The way in which the Summerisle Community starts off to appear so innocently and then seeing it at the end in such a barbaric way really creates a chilling contrast. When I hear of May Day now, I won't be thinking off children running round a pole covered in ribbons. But instead an almost possessed, nude Brit Ekland and the chilling howls of Edward Woodwar being burned alive! This is probably the first film I have ever watched that has genuinely horrified me without using any graphic violence.If you want to watch a film that makes you really think, rather than being slouched on a sofa being brain dead, watch 'The Wicker Man' and by the end, you will be on the floor trembling!",The Wicker Man

245,buddypatrick,Brilliance in a bottle...,10,26 November 2007,"How does a film be so good? Well every one of them has their flaws, and I'm sure even this, The Wicker Man, does, yet it's guaranteed that you'll surpass whatever flaws the film may hold due to the pure brilliance it beholds. Written by Anthony Schaffer (Sleuth, Frenzy) and directed by one hit wonder of film, Robin Hardy who is previously working on a somewhat another adaptation of his 1973 work called 'Cowboys for Christ', The Wicker Man is one of the best any could ever see.The Wicker Man is a great film; that's basically what I'm going to try to get across. The messages and themes in this movie are so phenomenal and elements bizarre, that its hard to believe people out their actually hate this movie. Whilst at first the film gives a some what biased message against Christianity, the movie unfolds into a matter of religion being some what a muddle in general due to human kind's way of behaving upon it. A film that strikes a message across over mans obsession over religion? Yes, it works, and oh how it does.The plot is as follows; Sergeant (Neil) Howie receives a letter from anonymous from Summerisle, a small secluded Scottish island consisting of a community with some what odd and different believes from the mainland's religion and culture which possibly fall into Paganism. The letter explains of a missing girl called Rowan Morrison. Howie, being an incredibly strict Christian, so strict that he refuses to have sexual intercourse before marriage, and strict to his career as a police officer, is given nothing but ""nonsense and rubbish"" as he asks the whereabouts of Rowan Morrison, and other questions to follow, which ends with a festival called May Day which lives up to the films poster art work. This is where the questioning of your personal beliefs comes in. Howie seems to be very closed minded and strict about the culture of the people on Summerisle, and although you may think the people of the island think the opposite back, they too are quite ignorant and ""insane"" due to their beliefs and religion hence ""God is dead, he had his chance"".The film has an amazing pace, and along the whole feature there are scenes such as a girls nasal passage wrapped around a tree on her grave, and a jar of foreskins in a local shop which makes this film so different and obscure like no other because of its exploration into unheard territories of religion(s) and culture that we as the majority of society may be very unaware of. Another thing about The Wicker Man is its incredible realistic portraying of ""pagan"" cultures, where as in the remake we see people running around in brown and white robes, and in this film we see them as normal and well presented people living on an island isolated from their culture, but not living in the 1800's or anything ridiculous and far-fetched. The film does play on its characters to represent the message of accepting one another's cultures, religion, beliefs etc.Not only has this but the movie has a certain spark of music to it. Along the whole movie there is folk like music that occasionally makes its way into the film and suits in very fine to what scenes it connects with, such as the scene between Howie and Willow (Britt Ekland) and their moment despite their separation of different rooms. The music adds more to the islander's crazy, fun yet somewhat enlightening religion.The acting from almost every character and actor in the film is remarkable. Edward Woodward does an absolute spectacular job as the strict, up tight ""no fun"" police officer, and his character works so well with him, its not only convincing, but you begin to get annoyed by his character for being so, as many would say ""boring"" and yet we as the audience can understand just how he feels about the way things are run on Summerisle, and in the end there is a complete character change, that makes you feel so gloomy over the ending of the film. Even Edward Woodward's character went on to inspire the Simon Pegg's character of Nicholas Angel in Hot Fuzz (2007) in which Woodward himself stars in too. Christopher Lee has always has a certain enigma about him as an actor, in the James Bond film The Man With the Golden Gun he plays a mysterious and intellectual man which is convincing, not only due to his acting abilities but his facial expression, height and so on. Even today in films such as Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005) he still has a morbid yet intelligent character about him despite he is only on screen for a few moments. All the extras of the film that appear on Summerisle also have this mysterious character about them. The sort of ""they know something I don't"" act is seen through whole movie by all the citizens of the island. Christopher Lee's role as Lord Summerisle has got to be one of the most influential and amazing performances I have ever seen on screen, and I'm sure there's more than a handful that agree with me.The Wicker Man, no matter how unheard of the film may be, should be seen by everyone who actually has a care left about film. This movie toys with personal beliefs and religion, and doesn't necessarily portray specific messages, but gives the viewer their own thought on the subject of religion, culture and beliefs. This land mark in film history will never be forgotten as long as people uphold its pure brilliance, no matter how many people say it isn't a horror film, and no matter how many remakes it may have. The Wicker Man has stood the test of time and as long as religion stays on the planet, this film will always stand the test of time.",The Wicker Man
246,nick_oke,Illuminati? You need to get out more.,9,12 July 2002,"One of the greatest 'cult' movies ever.Like so many classics (Blade Runner, Shawshank etc) it was considered something of a flop on first release, the original film being severely shortened to fit it into the old 'double bill' format which was popular in the seventies (I believe it was twinned with another superb nervy shocker - Don't Look Now). As a result, there are several versions of varying length and picture quality doing the rounds.The seemingly basic missing-child detective story begins to take some strange and unnerving turns involving pagan rites and free sexual morality. The 'seduction' scene involving Britt Eklund and a wall(!) stirred this teenager's hormones to a frenzy on first viewing back in the early 80's! My fantasy was destroyed when I learned recently that a body double was used!I digress. What makes this movie stand head and shoulders above the horror films of the time (and since) is that feeling of a man losing control and falling inexorably towards his doom. Edward Woodward has seldom been better than when he portrayed Sgt Howie - a man so confident and stubborn in his righteousness that when Summerisle and it's inhabitants challenge his beliefs, he refuses to acknowledge the evidence in front of his eyes. Until he meets the Wicker Man...The last five minutes are as good as any you will see - stay with it until the final frame when the Wicker Man bows his head to reveal the setting sun...",The Wicker Man
247,the_only_warrior,Unique and daring,8,30 May 2014,"This film is about a man who goes searching for a missing girl on Summerisle, a fictional island off the west-coast of Scotland. On arriving at the island, he finds it very different from the mainland, in that they have adopted very old religious beliefs.It has been said to be a horror film, but definitely NOT in the traditional sense. It is not frightening and has no horror themes, but unsettling the entire time. It is also said to be a musical, but the singing colors the atmosphere rather than telling the story in a traditional musical sense. And some of the creepiest moments in the film involve the songs and texts, some of which are traditional folk songs.This kind of film is very rare. It is rough around the edges, but also very sophisticated. The kinds of scenes being so indulgent with time and detail showing ritual, especially with long sections music and dance, are something I cannot imagine being accepted again by today's expectations.The only drawbacks I found was that the style of cutting was sometimes a little bit jerky. Some of the acting, not so much from the main actors but from the smaller parts, was pretty over-the-top and could have been more effective if they acted a bit more normally.Also, it is perhaps a little bit dated being released in the 70's - There is a lot of nudity and all of it is female nudity, which doesn't really make sense as it really should include both sexes.But all in all really worth a watch if you don't mind something a little bit weird and unconventional!",The Wicker Man

What he finds is a community of Pagans. I wont spoil the rest of the film for you. Its defiantly something you need to experience for yourselves. The film reminds me of the old game Broken Sword. Not for the story, but because this film could easily be a point and click kind of game. I love the way it blends the elements of horror, mystery and thriller all into one. The performances are all of the highest level most of all those of Christopher Lee and Edward Woodward. All the others do superbly as well and I must add Britt Ekland looks amazing. Probably my favourite thing about the film is the way the soundtrack fits it perfectly. I mean usually I would hate the thought of a folk music soundtrack but the look of the film with folk music over it is just amazing. The songs are all rather catchy too. The finale is one of movie history. It is something everyone should see for themselves.

How many eyebrows did it raise then? And how many controversies would have this film raised had it been made today? A remake was done in 2006➖is it as good as the original?What begins like a delectable musical, with a song about wheat and barley playing over an aerial photograph of the beautiful Scottish land- and seascapes, soon turns into something as subversive as possible. The ""landlord's daughter"" song, couples having sex in the open, the May Day ""tree-man-woman-man-grave"" song, young schoolgirls learning about ""phallic"" symbols from a stern school teacher, naked pregnant women dancing around and jumping over a bonfire so that their babies come out healthy, a live frog being pushed into a little girl's mouth (and then taken out a moment later) to cure her sore throat, the school teacher telling a devout Christian police officer that the concept of reincarnation is more acceptable to children than the concept of resurrection because reincarnation doesn't demand much of ""childish imagination"" as much as the resurrection of a ""rotting"" dead body does➖THE WICKER MAN is a brave and terrific attack on the concept of organised religion and making one's own choice in the matter of faith.The acting is top notch. If Edward Woodward is earnest as Sergeant Neil Howie, an officer of the Mainland Police and a devout Christian, investigating the disappearance of a young girl on the island of Summerisle; then Christopher Lee is terrifyingly sinister as Lord Summerisle, a self-proclaimed master of everyone and everything on the island of Summerisle. I would especially mention Britt Eklund, who brings in a throwing-caution-to-the-wind and I-don't-care kind of sex appeal as Willow, the innkeeper's daughter. What I liked most about THE WICKER MAN is that despite being a horror film, there are no visible elements of horror in the film; yet, the film is so atmospheric, I had this feeling that something was definitely not right on the island of Summerisle. Like I mentioned earlier, the film starts like a beautifully shot musical set in a picturesque location and progresses like one. Even the subversive scenes - scenes that powerfully challenge one's faith - are accompanied by songs➖beautifully rendered songs which are, again, of a subversive nature.There are three films I am really thankful I was able to see: Pier Paolo Pasolini's 'Salo', Ruggero Deodato's 'Cannibal Holocaust', and this one, Robin Hardy's THE WICKER MAN. These films are shocking, no doubt, but they also raise some important questions. THE WICKER MAN is a must-watch and I am happy that a film like this was made.And this just occurred to me so I am editing my review a bit (I would still give THE WICKER MAN 10 out of 10 because I found it to be a brave and well-made film). What was the actual intention of the makers of this film? Did they want to push the view that anyone who practises the so-called ""pagan"" rituals and does not conform to Christianity is evil?",The Wicker Man
252,psp777,"70s ""Cult"" Film; Rhythmic Weaving of Paganism with Imagination",8,14 March 2004,"Showing again on Apr 1 06A remote Scottish Island is the setting for sending the steadfast Christian, Sgt Neil Howie (EDWARD WOODWARD) to investigate an 'anonymous' tip-off by letter that a young girl has gone missing from the island under suspicious circumstances.Edward Woodward plays the role superbly by being the central vehicle for the 'classsic' shock reaction to the island's Pagan ways - just as well, as he's the only one who is! - it must be said, yes, must! - that that whilst the Pagan type rituals and rites of passage are heavily glamorised and exaggerated, they are built on the religions's basic premise.As the bewildered, Christian (no sex before marriage) Sgt (Edward Woodward) conducts his enquiries, he 'happens' on such events as a classroom of young girls being taught about the phallic symbolism of the Maypole, and encounters numerous fertility rites as part of the villager's day to day life . . . and nightly activities ... the Landlord's daughter doubles as serving wench, eager to please all and sundry, especially willing host to the island's boys and their right of 'passage'.**The last couple of decades of UK news events and media hype regarding bizarre rituals (this review written March 2004) (film repeated UK April 06) perhaps adds a more sober dimension to the film's 'mystery' - having said that, the good acting, fresh atmosphere and role of Christopher Lee as Lord Summerisle, complete with kilt, helps keep the imagination alive to the unexpected.The hearty-cum-sensual 'folky' music complete with thrusting tambourine beat highlights the bawdy lyrics that accompany many subliminal moments of the film; one particular scene with this sensual beat manages to penetrate the walls of room where the God-fearing Sgt is staying.The soundtrack is an essential component, and on reflection ensures the continuity of the film's atmosphere and cleverly gives dimension to the rest of the cast, made up of some quite famous as well as some very odd-looking characters that you would expect to find yourself surrounded by as an unwanted stranger on this island.The film is wonderfully quirky, odd, off-beat, colourful and still has the power to ensure devout Christians are left ""tut-tutting"".The title ""The Wicker Man"" or the complete title ""Anthony Sheaffer's The Wicker Man"" is all part of the twist - no spoilers here - but let's just say that the wicker in that year was not needed to construct baskets to carry fruit, as it was a failed year for produce (you may pick up a clue when the good Sgt is offered tinned fruit during his overnight stay at the local pub on the island!) - so as you'll see at the end of the film - the basket weaving was a little neglected, but put to good use otherwise!The final part of the film is further enriched by the traditional Pagan costumes sported on May Day (you don't want to be here on May Day). . . quite a twist at the end that wraps up this little adventure into wicca and paganism - as long as you aren't too picky about facts.I have comeback to my review and read some of the other comments - everyone is entitled to a opinion - but do ya really think Pagans run amok like that? btw the 'freezing of the scene was perhaps a mere heartbeat jumping in Sgt Howie's virgin chest?""8.5 /10",The Wicker Man
253,john-souray,Misunderstandings,8,16 August 2006,"*** May contain spoilers, but I'll try not to *** I can't believe how many people misunderstand the Wicker Man. Does everyone fall asleep half way through? There are hundreds of comments here, and obviously I can't check every one (well I can, but I can't be bothered), but all the ones I've looked at get it wrong.The religion in the Wicker Man; it isn't particularly pagan, it isn't druidic, it isn't pre-Christian, and it isn't Ancient British. It's made up. Lord Summerisle explains this quite clearly half way through, when he tells Howie how his grandfather established the community, but that something was missing, so he introduced this artificial religion as an exercise in social engineering.This isn't just accidental either. It's critical to understanding the appalling ending, where Howie warns Summerisle that this awful sacrifice better work, or else he'll be next. Hence the haunted expression on Summerisle's face, because he knows Howie is right, and because he also knows that the religion is made up, and it's just a load of old tosh. And that makes the horror even worse for Howie, because he knows that there is nothing he can do, and that at least one participant knows it's a charade, but will go through with it anyway.I've given this film 8 stars, which for me is high praise, and though I didn't think much of it when I first saw it (when it was first released) it grows in my estimation every time I see it. It's certainly much more intelligent than even its fans appear to give it credit for.There's a message for contemporary Britain here. Britain is going through a crisis of xenophobia and racism because of imagined problems with immigration. There are a number of idiots around who claim that we need to rediscover a sense of national identity and rediscover our Britishness (or, in some versions, our Englishness), and crucially, they also claim that such nationalism can be benign and non-racist. They need to watch the Wicker Man and think about it very hard. This invention of a set of ideas to fulfill a perceived social need is exactly what Lord Summerisle's grandfather did, and look what a Frankenstein's monster he created.The final irony in all this is that there is a British singer songwriter called Billy Bragg, a leftwinger who witters on about rediscovering or reclaiming Britishness or Englishness just as I've described. But this same Billy Bragg has also derided the Wicker Man for presenting a travesty of pagan religion. Yes, Billy. Of course it's a travesty. It's meant to be. Go back and watch it again, and this time pay attention. They're talking about you.",The Wicker Man
254,loco12,Atmospheric masterpiece with a huge twist in the tale,10,16 July 2002,"I saw the Wicker man in 1973 when it was first released in the theatres. I was only 14 at the time, and not old enough to see it legitimately. I sneaked in with a friend up the emergency exit of the local Odeon in Swindon and sat through the film wide eyed, the highlight being of course (being a hormonal lad) seeing the beautiful Britt Eklands knockers as she danced about.The film left a lasting impression on me and I had never forgotten it (or Britts tits).Then last month I saw that the movie had been brought out on DVD, together with the Directors cut. I purchased it straight away and watched the longer version that night. All the memories (or was it mamories) came flooding back and I watched entranced as the film unfolded. And what a great movie it is to!I won't go into details about the plot as it's been well documented here, but just to say my wife, who had never seen the film before, just couldn't believe the ending! She loved it.Christopher Lee, Edward Woodward, Britt Ekland and all the locals who took part acted their socks off and deserve the praise that has been heaped upon them.Small Spoilers-------- Personally I prefer the directors cut of the film. In this version it is easier to understand Edward Woodwards character, and where he is coming from and why he turned down the lovely Britt when she sang out to him to come to her. (I would have been there in a flash with her first call!) The film also has about a dozen songs in it, but don't let that put you off. They add a certain feel to the film that makes it even better. End Spoilers---------If you want to see a great atmospheric movie, with a fantastic story about kidnap, murder, the occult and a musical to boot, then this is the film to get your hands on!Don't miss it. 10/10",The Wicker Man

256,Alex Klotz,Even in a cut version this is one of the most fantastic films ever made.,10,4 October 2001,"I've first seen this movie when i was about twelve years old as it ran on Dutch TV. Because my English wasn't very well back then (it's still far from perfect, excuse me), I couldn't understand much of the dialogue, let alone the dutch subtitles. But i was instantly hooked. There are so many powerful and unique images in the movie, like the may day celebrations or the marvelous ending scene that make it worthwhile to watch. It also creates, with the help of creative photography, highly professional acting and an excellent musical score, a slightly disturbing atmosphere of the unreal that most horror movies (especially those of a more recent vintage) fail to achieve. It's been one of my favorite movies for almost twenty years; and it will probably remain there in my Top 5 list for a long time.",The Wicker Man
257,Soucriant,Mesmerizing,10,17 June 2006,"The Wicker Man is one of those few films that is unlike anything else. I have tried to compare it to other movies without success, it is truly in its own league. We follow a police officer named Sergent Howie to a remote island in Scotland called Summerisle. He is investigating the disappearance of a young girl, and from the moment he sets foot on the island you can tell something isn't quite right.The locals are secretive, unhelpful and downright strange. And intriguingly so. The Wicker Man is a mystery within a mystery and utterly compelling. You will feel Sergent Howie's despair and frustration as he constantly asks where is the missing girl, and receiving neither a straightforward or satisfactory answer.The music that accompanies this masterpiece enhances the already tense and dreamlike atmosphere greatly. The melodic and haunting sounds can be soothing at times but full of malice. The cast are brilliant. The islanders are utterly convincing as oblivious Devil should care types, who see nothing wrong with their lifestyle or what they are a part of. Edward Woodward gives a heroic performance as the confused Sergent determined to discover the truth. It is Christopher Lee however who steals the show as the island's minister, Lord Summerisle.Christoper Lee delivers an Oscar worthy performance as the proud and well spoken leader. His casual manner and overwhelming sense of authority add to the already sinister and unsettling theme of the film.The Wicker Man is one of my top ten favourite films as it is so unique and absolutely captivating. It is portrayed lightly throughout, but with an undercurrent of darkness and doom. As i'm sure you've already heard about the famous ending, i however won't spoil it. But i will tell you it is shocking and has stuck with me since the first time i saw it. Great ending, spectacular film.",The Wicker Man

260,Jamalio,Classic 70s' British Horror,10,17 January 2002,"The Wickerman was made at a time when British films were innovative and gritty, weighty rather than stylish, and cocksure rather than cocky. It tells the tale of a police constable assigned to investigate the murder of a young girl- and when he reaches the island, is digraced at the lack of Christianity that the inhabitants refuse to follow- instead, they focus their attention on worshipping Satan. The police constable- who accuses them of blasphemy- believes their is a link in the attitude of the locals to the missing child, and pretty soon these accusations turn into murder.
Quite why actor Edward Woodward (great name!) is not recognised in other films is a mystery, as he puts on such a believable performance it makes the final 'twist' in the tale (which must have had an influence on Se7en) all the more tragic, yet it could'nt have ended on a more fitting note. The style of the film itself is beautifully restrained, and focuses more on the deranged, twisted attitudes the locals have, their clash with the police constable, and the authoritative presence of Lord Summerisle (played with gleefull menace by Christopher Lee, who claims this to be his favourite film). A subtle masterpiece of hypocrisy, religous propoganda and liberalist attitudes which climaxes with genuine horror 10/10.",The Wicker Man
261,TheCharles,Isle Of The Bizarre,8,4 April 2016,"The movie starts off with a police officer from the mainland who travels to an isle to investigate the disappearance of a girl. Soon he discovers that the lifestyle of the community differs from his as he is repelled by the pagan rituals and open acceptance of sexuality. What frustrates him most though, is that the locals won't seem to cooperate in the investigation.It's hard to decide in what genre The Wicker Man fits the most. It's a non-scary but very mysterious Horror movie. Quite 'cheesy' but I believe it aged well as The Wicker Man maintains its quality with the storytelling. The bizarre atmosphere is absolutely fantastic as well.If there's one thing that may have bothered me a bit was that the locals didn't seem to be to concerned about their poor harvest. Perhaps a bit silly, but the best part may be the soundtrack. If you like Neofolk you're in for a treat.",The Wicker Man
262,nekrotikk,One of my all time favourite films.,10,18 April 2019,"'The Wicker Man' (1973) is one of my favourite films. I'm Pagan and know that some people don't like the inaccurate portrayal of Pagans in this film. But as the film is a work of fiction, I think we can enjoy the story without comparing it to any branch of Paganism, modern or historical.I recommend the director's cut over the theatrical. The director's cut adds a lot of atmosphere and character development.This is where the spoilers will start...The image used for most of the physical and digital promotion is great if you've seen the film, but could be a spoiler for anyone who hasn't.'The Wicker Man' follows a Christian police officer going to an island to investigate a report of a missing girl. Only when he gets to the island does he realise everyone on the island is a Pagan who wants to sacrifice him in a giant wicker man to ensure a good harvest.Starring Christopher Lee, Edward Woodward, Britt Ekland, and Ingrid Pitt, it feels very much like a Hammer film even though it isn't one. I see this as a good thing because Hammer created a classic style that draws the viewer in.'The Wicker Man' is a fairly slow moving film and I wouldn't say any of the visuals are scary, but the story itself could be. For the story to be scary you just have to believe there are people in an isolated area who want to kill strangers.So what makes 'The Wicker Man' a good film when compared to more modern examples of a group of people trying to kill strangers like 'House of 1000 Corpses'? In my opinion, the lack of gore. Now don't get me wrong, I love gory films. I'll happily watch films just for cool gore effects. But gory films aren't often the ones that leave a lasting fear in my mind. The more special effects a film has, the less realistic it tends to look in years to come. Everything in 'The Wicker Man' still looks real. But some of the effects in 'House of 1000 Corpses' have aged badly enough to be funny. I love 'House of 1000 Corpses', by the way, I just can't honestly say it still looks as good as it did when it came out. Nothing in 'The Wicker Man' takes me out of the story.The end scene in 'The Wicker Man' in particular manages to be haunting and unforgettable without the need for overly graphic gore or violence. They had one shot at getting that scene because they only had one wicker man. The animals and Edward Woodward are actually in the wicker man for some of those shots. Forced perspective is used for the rest as they obviously didn't kill Edward Woodward or the animals.Modern horror films tend to have much faster pacing so 'The Wicker Man' probably won't appeal to those who expect faster pacing and jump scares. However, it will leave you with the horrific idea that you would be powerless against a group of people wanting to kill you.",The Wicker Man
263,zyclunt,Okay movie but nothing special,6,29 August 2021,"I've always heard Wicker Man was a cult classic and unfortunately I don't see why. The story is fine, policeman looking a missing girl on an island run by some strange cult. And that's all there is a lot of strange pagan rituals and no horror elements, no creepy factor or tension. But there is a bit of singing. Movie is well made Christopher Lee is always a joy to watch. On the other hand Edward Woodward who plays policeman is annoying a real fool and catholic biggot. Maybe the 85 minutes version I've seen was butchered. Maybe if I haven't seen first the 2006 remake and sort of remake Midsommar ending would made some impact on me. Maybe.

264,smegma23,A wonderful thriller with dreadful music (possibly spoilers?),8,23 October 2006,"I think The Wicker Man 1973 is probably the single most dissonant movie I've ever seen in terms of soundtrack music versus the rest of the film (although the song over the opening credits of The Ninth Configuration really tries, momentarily, to wrest the title away). TWM is an effective, creepy flick, regardless of whether the showcased pagan beliefs & customs are unsettling (and i think we're mostly meant to identify only remotely with Sgt. Howie's growing horrorhe really is a right prude and the flick was made in very libertine times; though, after all, immolation can really spoil one's afternoon). And to my way of thinking, Edward Woodward's francophonic pronunciation of ""turquoise"" is itself worth the price of admission. But the true, immutable, almost Lovecraftian horror of the movie is its music, from the ""Corn Rigs and Barley Rigs"" song over the credits to the truly loathsome balladization of the circle of life around the maypole to the pub music to which Britt Eckland ostensibly makes love to a wall. Awful, awful stuff, and all the worse for being so obviously new-writ for the movie, instead of sounding like (or actually being) traditional music, such as the residents of Summerisle would undoubtedly sing and play to accompany their millennia-old rites and ceremonies.",The Wicker Man

Edward Woodward must be commended for making his character a likable, if boring, lead man (and that's an achievement: I don't like Christian-types).

267,captain_bungle,"Superior drama, musical, horror, thriller, erotica, mystery...",9,14 April 2005,"British horror movies. What is it that these three words project into your mind? The Gothic melodramatics of Hammer? Long, dark coats and flaming torches? Frankenstein? Dracula? Or none of the above? Is the impact of the British horror film so feeble that it doesn't even spark a reaction in your mind? You'd be forgiven as, despite from a few real gems in Hammer's back catalogue, the history of British horror is seeped in watered down, made-to-formula genre movies of very little substance. Of course, great movies were still being made, but one stands the test of time particularly well for its era. That film is The Wicker Man (1973), and its history is as intriguing as the film itself.Edward Woodward stars as Sgt. Neil Howie, a devout Christian and policeman searching for a missing girl on the Scottish Island of Summerilse. There are many clues suggesting that the girl has been killed as a sacrifice by the pagan cult that inhabits the island, lead by Lord Summerisle (Christopher Lee). But Howie soon discovers that the girl may be held alive somewhere for a forthcoming ritual, and sets out to find her. During his time on the island, Howie encounters all kinds of blasphemous activity performed by the inhabitants who have rejected Christianity in favour of the 'old gods'. He witnesses fertility rituals where naked girls jump through fire, schoolchildren dancing around phallic maypoles, a school teacher lecturing on the importance of fertility and bizarre, masked people wandering the streets. Howie's Christianity (and virginity) is also put at risk by the landlord's daughter (Britt Ekland), who dances and sings naked in a room next to his, enticing him to a point where his faith (and the content of his scrotum) is almost lost.The narrative of The Wicker Man centralises on the conflict between Christianity and paganism without ever taking sides. This is shown beautifully within the characters of Howie and Lord Summerisle, with Woodward and Lee playing off each other, embodying the films exploration of religious differences through their performances (Lee has said that his performance is the best of his career). The naïve, virginal, honest Howie proves to be no match for the calm, manipulative evil of Summerisle, and Howie's fate seems to be completely in his hands, but for those who have yet to see The Wicker Man, I will write no further of the outcome. If you have never heard of The Wicker Man's ending then you are praised indeed, and should see it before you find out just what is so shocking about it.Hardy's direction maintains consistency as the film switches between the bizarre, the comic, the erotic and the chilling, whilst also finding time for a few musical sequences (the one in which the landlord's daughter tries to seduce Howie from the room next door is particularly well done). In fact, The Wicker Man seems to switch genres frequently throughout, yet what could easily have been an uneasy mish-mash of genres is instead consistent, poetic, thoughtful and frightening in the hands of Hardy, whose willingness to just let things happen creates a feeling that just anything might. But this insistence to throw everything together may put some people off, as the film is never entirely sure what it wants to be. But those willing to go with the flow will find it a remarkably rewarding experience, and one that is not easy to forget.The Wicker Man was hardly seen upon its release, mainly due to poor marketing and the distributors difficulty in categorising the film itself (Hardy was known to keep changing his mind about the nature of the film throughout production, telling crew it was now a musical / a thriller / a comedy etc.) Also, a horror film that takes place in bright sunlight instead of dark, shadowy corridors probably confused the poor saps at the distribution company. The film was also heavily cut by distributors who didn't understand what the film was supposed to be about, but now, with a recent release on video and DVD, The Wicker Man is available in its longest form, just as Hardy had envisioned it. But finding the missing footage proved to be an exhaustive and painful exercise, as no one knew of its whereabouts. The footage was eventually found in the vaults of Roger Corman's production company, as he had been sent a print on the film's completion. This print was used to restore the missing footage, but still the only existing negative has never been found and is believed to be buried underneath a motorway somewhere in England. For a more in-depth account of this particular films history, pick up Allan Brown's excellent book 'Inside The Wicker Man'.Although slightly dated, the theme of conflicting religious beliefs is just as relevant today and the intriguing detective story will keep just about everyone hooked.",The Wicker Man

Well the obvious answer is yes for the death that is caused (what religion doesn't cause death?) but on the other side of the coin they are not at fault as thy are doing what they believe in on their island, they are happy folk who have positive beliefs and a crime free state, if the Sergeant had been nicer and a bit more open with them perhaps things would have been different?

Christopher Lee played his role brilliantly as the carefree Lord of the island, which keeps the puritanical Howie off balance until the finale. I really enjoyed the music as well, save for the 'Corn Rig' tune, a 60s-style movie music piece which cropped up far too often. It screwed up the pace of the film in it's insipidness.

I wouldn't classify it as a horror movie though. More of a thriller/drama. Some people may find it a little slow, but I think that the little bits of frequent nudity kept me entertained.

Wow! I simply have to use the old cliché', they just don't make movies like this anymore. The plot, settings, actors, and ending come together for a harrowing journey, that sets out as a nice detective piece, and then moves into something far more mysterious, and eventually, shocking. Christopher Lee and Edward Woodward were absolutely marvelous, especially in their first meeting. Without reading any spoilers ahead of time, I knew about 2/3rd's through the movie what was going to happen, and when it did, it still sent shudders down my spine.*Spoiler Alert*Woodward's reaction at the first sight of the WickerMan, was mine as well. He said it. I thought it. Add to that the animals in there as well, and man, what a powerful moment. Was this a classic horror movie? Maybe not, but it definitely stays with you after you watch it. And that, more than anything, places it in a category all to it's own. I am so glad that this movie finally is getting the props it deserves, and if you are thinking of purchasing it, you have to get the Collector's Edition, which has about 12 minutes of original footage that is not only essential for the whole affect of the film, but drops some subtle hints as to what is actually going down.A 9/10 must see. 1 point deducted for some bad folk music, although you have to listen to the words of the songs, as they get more and more sinister as you go along.",The Wicker Man

The soundtrack is appropriately creepy . It is just such a shame that this film was lost for so many years, manly due to British Lion who wouldn't disribute it properly. It was originally placed in a double bill with ""Don't look Now"" and within a year it had vanished from the cinema screens in the U.K. Cut to pieces by the distributer and over shadowed by ""The Exorcist"" on it's original release, it is only now that it is finally getting the reconigition it has always deserved.",The Wicker Man
274,zdh952,"Good thriller, But over hyped as a horror film",7,4 March 2015,"I will say, ahead of time, that I had this ending ruined for me before I saw the film, but I will try and remove that aspect of my experience from my review.Edward Woodward plays Howie, a police officer sent from the mainland of England to Lord Summerisle's (played by Christopher Lee) private island to investigate the disappearance of a young girl. As the film progresses, Woodward is progressively more and more baffled and horrified by the pagan religious practices of the residents of the island, ending in twist at the end I won't ruin, because I don't want to detract from the film's impact. It could be a product being raised in the 90s and 00's where everyone is so concerned with freedom of self expression and political correctness, but I find Woodwards character to be stuck up, needlessly hostile, xenophobic and generally unlikable. He is a devoted Christian man being thrust into a pagan world, and his indigence makes sense for the character, but I found the character the be largely unlikable. His character is contrasted by Christopher Lee, who plays Lord Sumerisle, is obviously hiding something concerning the disappearance of the young girl. He is kind, cordial, and very patient with Woodward's hostility. To me, this sets up a very interesting dichotomy. You have the main character, a man the audience relates to, because he is a lay man from a normal, religious world. But even though we relate to him he is unlikable. Then you have the character of Sumerisle, who lives a baffling life with an archaic religion. So he seems wrong, but is the obviously more personable character. By the end of the movie these lines are so blurred for me i don't know who i like and who i hate. And I LOVE it. By the end of the movie, both parties display religious zealotry that seem insane, given the circumstance.The use of music in this movie is incredibly odd at first, but believe me, if you go with it, it adds so much to the atmosphere you wont be able to think of a standard score being effective. At times the movie almost becomes a musical. In the end, i can't think of this as a horror movie, even though there were parts that horrified me. I consider this a fine thriller but not a good horror movie, which is an important distinction.Definite recommend for horror/thriller fans, but i don't think it's for everyone. 7/10",The Wicker Man
275,Shayde9,Paganism at its funniest (not quite its finest)!!!,10,29 April 1999,"My husband and our best friend and I had never even heard of this movie before the year 1997.  We found it listed in a small book about Celtic paganism that we were thumbing through and then the three of us went on a mad search of video stores to find it. We just had to see it...a movie about paganism!  We were certain, however, that like most films, it would paint our faith in a really bad light.And I guess to some people, it did.  What with the final scene of Edward Woodward............. But it was all for a good cause...wasn't it?Seriously, this movie was good clean fun...just like most Christians would say about the Spanish Inquisition scene in Mel Brooks' ""History of the World, Part I.""  I'll agree...it was a funny movie, but what Christians don't realize or understand is that was a really sad, brutal time for people who were not Christian.  But back to ""The Wicker Man""...I find that this movie is an attention getter from the very beginning.  Of course, this was in part because the three of us who were watching it are pagan to begin with.  We wanted to see this portrayed in a movie.  And we wanted it to be positive.As I said, some would argue that the pagans were the ""good guys"" of the movie.  Most would say that Neil Howie (Woodward) was the hero who unfortunately meets his end bravely while being used as the sacrifice of a group of barbaric heathens.  Others would realize that it's Howie's self-righteous attitude and closed minded beliefs that bring about his martyr-like death.  And isn't that what certain people like...martyrs????One of the things that we especially loved about the movie was the fact that so many of the people had Nature-oriented names.  ""Rowen"" Morrison...""Willow"" (played by blonde bomb-shell Britt Eckland)...and countless others.  The references to the hare(s) was another point that was great for those of us who understand the ""meanings"" behind their presence in just such a story.The idea of using ritual to aid in the fertility of the crops is not a new idea.  It's one that dates back to as far as there was people on this planet.  Ritual sacrifice is a part of it.  The burning of the sacrificial candidate (Howie/Woodward) was integral to the people of Summerisle.  Lord Summerisle (Christopher Lee) leads the ritual drama and finally the sacrifice itself, promising the people of his island that the crops will be fertile and plenty again for the following year.  A sacrifice like this was performed, according to history, throughout many different cultures. Egyptians, Greeks, Celts (as in this movie), Aztecs and even the Biblical Jews...remember Abel the shepherd and all the other sacrificial lambs that meant prosperity in the coming months?  What about Abraham and his son Isaac?  Or even better...Jesus allowing himself to be killed for the sins of his followers?  The ultimate sacrifice.I guess what I'm trying to say (without getting into the nitty-gritty details of a bunch of history) is that this is a great film.  It has it's typical 1970s cheesy moments, of course, but it represents paganism with heart and spirit and shows that Nature is to be respected.  Above all else, it is a movie about honoring Mother Earth...with a few laughs along the way.
I highly recommend this film.  Both for pagans and for Christians.  Despite the big sacrifice scene at the end (which by the way, most pagans DON'T do these days...sacrifices are not a common practice of ours anymore...), it offers a way to understand the beliefs which are otherwise feared and hated because they are so different.  And it does it in a manner that is easily understood.",The Wicker Man

What gives? - have people been shelling out their savings in a desperate bid to find on-screen entertainment - only to have their hopes dashed against the rocks of disappointment? Sure sounds like it! I guess I better add my encounter/appointment with the Wicker Man to the list.I first saw this movie when I was quite young on TV in the late '70's. I'm sure it would have been severely edited for TV -  with very little sex or nudity to worry about, but it made a big impression on me and it left me feeling uneasy - this could well be the strangest movie I'd ever seen. My view of the world had just been altered!  In every TV show, movie, and real life incident I'd observed up till that time,   policemen (and other figures of authority) were always in control - and there were always others to back them up. That was the way of the world, wasn't it? So how could a figure of authority like Howie be so far out of his depth, and have so little control over his situation?""   True, this is not a horror film by what we expect of the genre these days i.e. monsters, psychotic killers etc. The real horror here is Howie's predicament, finding himself in a situation with no familiar boundaries, where the rules and regulations which he has existed by in normal society count for nought. This premise is much more subversive and scary (& should still be) than any haunted house or possessed teenager coughing up bile. People's lives are built upon assumptions & understandings about the way things work, and to have all these stripped away would indeed be frightening. The other aspects of the film? Well, I guess we are dissuaded from siding with Howie too much, and he is portrayed as something of a control freak, representing uptight conformity at it's most repressive. But siding with the pagans isn't all that easy either, which I guess leaves you dangling somewhere in between?  The rituals & aspects of daily life shown in the film vary between quaint/bizarre/and just plain odd.  The music? a matter of taste I guess - I ordered the CD soundtrack as soon as it came out and I wouldn't part with it. Will have to give this movie a 10 out of 10 on the ""saw it when I was younger & I still think it's great (even if some other people don't)"" scale.",The Wicker Man

Great performance from Edward Woodward, who played the Sergeant. The ominous camera cuts to just show the sun with eery sounds playing in the background is some of the creepiest moments in this movie, and the sound design is really well done in tense or dramatic situations.

I have no idea - but what I do know is that I absolutely hated this movie from the minute it started to the minute it finished. As this movie was out before my time I wasn't really aware of it until the mid 90's when I read an article in a film magazine about the best horror films of all time and this one was placed quite high at number 3 or 4 so I decided to ask my dad about it. He went on to tell me that it was one of the greatest films of all time and that I have to see it as it is really really good. My mother overheard this conversation and told me to not bother as it sucked. I decided my dad would be right on this occasion as he had introduced me to many other great horror movies such as Halloween, Friday the 13th, Psycho and many others. After spending a few days trawling around video shops (this was before DVDs) I eventually found an old copy in a second hand shop and bought it and watched it. As soon as it finished I put it in the bin and had a row with my dad over his crap judgement and told my mother I would never not believe her again as this movie is just an absolute awful piece of junk which is just over-hyped and overrated and it isn't even a horror film! I know the masses will disagree with me but I don't really care as I hated it all and actually preferred the Nicolas Cage remake which was just as bad but at least it had some horror elements to it!",The Wicker Man

280,noirlover,Scariest thing about it is those horrendous songs! And Christopher Lee in a bad wig!,7,1 November 2003,"(No real spoilers). Glad I rented this so I could fast-forward through the many hippy dippy folk songs, especially the ever-present 'Corn Rigs' song. Urgh. There are so many songs that it's almost a musical! Christopher Lee's wig (not the Mayday one, but the fluffy, light brown one) is also cause for alarm! However, I did enjoy this film apart from these serious detriments and I'll watch Christopher Lee in anything. (I prefer him in stuff like 'The Devil Rides Out,' where he's very elegant .) Some joker had ruined the ending of this movie for me, but I still didn't know exactly how it was coming, or why. It's a strange, subversive film that seems very much a product of its time, what with the hippie values and all. There's been talk of remaking it, but I imagine they'd have to jettison the songs and some of the Woodstock-era sensibilities. Who could play the religious, stiff-necked Sergeant? Would a character that old-fashioned and devout even work today? Perhaps Mel Gibson or Jim Caviezel would fit the bill, but I can't see them agreeing to it! By the way, first heard of this via 'Shallow Grave,' when Ewan McGregor is watching it (clearly he's watching the 'Oh, God,no!' ending). 7/10",The Wicker Man

A classic of its kind, it deserves the re-release it will probably never get.Superficially a mystery thriller, this intelligent and well researched story delves into the beliefs and rituals of Ancient Britain, its folk mythologies and music, and reveals some of the un-settling fears that lie at their root.  Set on a remote Scottish Island and giving the appearance of being a Whisky Galore, Local Hero type community, there is yet something off-centre about the townspeople that Edward Woodward, as Sergeant Howie, has come to investigate.  The presence of Christopher Lee as the eloquent, commanding Lord of the Isle, gives the film an insidiously creepy edge suggesting a Hammer Horror lurks around the next wee wall.  He is perfect in the role.The story un-folds like a cross between Chinatown and Rosemary's Baby, as the dogged Howie gets led all over town, up one blind alley and down another.  Clues are dropped all the way about what is really going on, but we don't heed them.  Until it's too late.  Too late to walk away.The standard video version runs for 85 minutes, cuts many important scenes and shows others out of sequence.  A BBC version shown in 1998 ran around 95 minutes.  The full version ran 102 minutes but I have never found it.However, whilst uneven in parts and certainly flawed this is one of the most intelligent and interesting stories I have ever seen on film.

You gotta love Chrisopher Lee's tongue in cheek performance as Lord Summerisle, the pagan ruler of this isolated Scottish community.  Perhaps the finest point in the film is Brett Eckland shaking her booty to one of the many ecclectic folk songs that grace this cult classic.  Rent it.  No, buy it.

It almost makes you feel at ease while watching it. The atmosphere really catches you and pulls you in. The acting wasn't bad either.The movie is about Sergent Howie; played by Edward Woodward coming to a place called Summerisle looking for a missing girl. But what's strange is no one has ever seen or heard of the girl. Well, Howie eventually finds out they're lying and when he finds out the real truth; he can't except it. The movie is like a goose chase all the way to the end. Well, anyways, Lord Summerisle; played by Christopher Lee tells Howie of the town's religion. How they think when one dies; they come back as something else. But Howie can't except that, since he is a really Christian man.Howie starts doing some detective work and is able to find out that the girl that was missing was still alive and is led to believe that she is going to be a sacrifice since the town didn't have a good harvest last year.This is great movie and though I seen the ending coming; it still took me by surprise.

Thoroughly slimy AND boring. Didn't finish it, would rather take out the trash or darn socks.

A very well written, thought provoking storyline, adding great mystery and tension throughout, along with some pretty surreal imagery. I thought Edward Woodward as Sergeant Howie was amazing, especially in the final moments of the film - a truly chilling and moving performance. (Pulls off a pretty good Scottish accent too!) Sir Chris was also great in his role (even if his screen time wasn't as long as I expected). Nice to see Britt Eckland and Ingrid Pitt amongst the recognisable faces also. I think one of the main attractions to the film were the locations. The opening shots of Howie in his plane overlooking 'The Old Man of Storr' and the finale on the cliffs were breathtaking (especially on this Blu Ray)! The music was something else that surprised me, it almost felt like a musical (in a good way!) Overall, I can see why this film gets such high praise and will definitely be revisiting it (especially with the various cuts available on the Blu Ray). Just wish I could have seen it on a big screen. A unique masterpiece of film!",The Wicker Man
287,Pem-3,Brilliant Mystery Imagines a Druid Island,10,13 November 1998,"This beautiful thriller is not really a horror film, although there are some frightening things in it.  It is a brilliant invention of an ""alternative universe"" in modern time on one lonely Scottish isle, where the residents have reverted to the religion and customs of Ancient Britain.  Beautifully plotted, directed and acted as a ""murder mystery,"" it has a stodgy but sympathetic police sergeant as its hero and a tremendous cast of quirky eccentrics, the island's residents, who out-maneuver him at every turn. The locale, Summerisle, is lovingly created down to the last detail, including quite a bit of delicious pseudo-folk music by a group called ""Lodestone"" (aka ""Magnet"") and some fine humorous touches.  One of the best British productions of the 1970s, it should not be missed. This is not a children's film, so see the 95 to 98 minute version which is much the best edit. Though it contains suggestive language and disturbing ideas, there is no real violence or sex that would be offensive to a thoughtful adult. The original (85 mins.) release  destructively cut 10 minutes, partly from the heart of the story, presumably to outguess the censor.  Those cuts can not be justified even by the ""tighter"" standards of the 1960s, which produced much more salacious and violent stuff, particularly in the ""spy"" genre.",The Wicker Man

I have heard the film was badly cut when at the time of release the studio was taken over, and this is my one and only critrique of the film - that it lacks continuity, in this case more would have been more.

289,lornamd-1,A Good Story But A Badly Made Film,4,30 December 2006,"To me the Wicker Man has the ingredients to be a classic horror film. It has a good story, a good twist at the end and doesn't have the clichés that most horror films are full of. But unfortunately apart from Christopher Lee and maybe Ingrid Pitt the acting is either average or downright bad - the landlord, Britt Eklands father looks like he should be in a pantomime - and it lacks suspense or atmosphere that a film (especially a slow paced film) needs to keep the viewer interested.Many parts of the film are silly, the Landlords Daughter song where Britt Ekland's character laughs and dances happily as the men of the village label her a sex object that everybody gets to sleep with is a real low point, and the Scottish accents are terrible which is distracting and pretty disappointing considering The Wicker Man is a British film.There is nothing wrong with the basic story and the way it is brought together and they keep you guessing till the end is clever and I also think it is interesting that they made the main character unlikable but unfortunately for me the faults of the film outweigh the good points.Apparently the remake is terrible which is a shame because I feel that if this was well directed and acted it could be a really good film but sadly it isn't.",The Wicker Man

What sticks in my mind the most is that all of the people in the town have grown up thinking that their lives are normal, to the point where they have no problem singing and dancing while a man burns to death right in front of them. These people have been brainwashed by tradition and don't know any other way of living which when you think about it is any xenophobic's response to going abroad and visiting other countries...that's the magic of this film, it turns the premise around on the viewer and dares you to find anything wrong with Summerisle, when the traditions and customs of the outside world are just as strange to them.

This cannot be considered a thinking man's horror either as the story told a linear tale throughout.The end of the movie was a plus point & was slightly different from the norm which puts this movie in the average category but only just as it was heading in the poor direction.5 Out of Ten",The Wicker Man

It has been called the Citizen Kane of horror. It has been called Sci-Fi. It is neither.It is simply the story of a righteous man who is put to the test of his own faith.

It's one of the very few works of cinema-history that transforms into anything you want it to be: may it be horror, may it be thriller, may it be satire. For me it's a black-comedy-folk-musical and as black comedy goes it's up there with the best. It's is as dark and horrific as Kubrick's ""Dr. Strangelove"" and ""The Wicker Man""'s final scene even rivals the famous bomb-ride of Slim Pickens in Kubrick's masterpiece. The horror doesn't rely on pointed teeth or spilled guts but some very basic revelations about human nature. Religion is forced onto you by birth, place and upbringing. Here the christian stands alone against a community of pagans and everything he represents suddenly seems to be just as (or even more) bizarre, elaborated and downright silly than the heathen rituals he encounters. As for the musical part it's just done with a natural grace. Actually this is one of the very few musicals where the scenes of singing and dancing are motivated (by the villager's lifestyle) and thus becoming organic. When the townpeople get into their nicely choreographed sequence about the lovely inn-keeper's daughter you will be reminded of Dennis Potter's musical fantasies. And in terms of comedy think Monty Pythons (the animal heads that quickly duck behind the pier when Sergeant Howie can't start his plane) or contemporary british comedy troupe ""The League of Gentleman"" (""This is a local shop for local people!"") who borrowed heavily from this films style and setting.

The people of Summerisle are lead by 'Lord Summerisle' (Christopher Lee,) whom 'Howie' believes is orchestrating a cover-up over the disappearance of 'Rowan Morrison,' as not even her own mother will acknowledge her existence. 'Howie' is to be sacrificed by the people of this island (who sabotage his plane) in order to convince nature to favour them. This film is riddled with excellent quotes and strange events. A horror film as they should be - on a psychological level rather than a knife wielding, white-masked, indestructible killer (you know who I'm talking about - John Carpenter!)Christopher Lee was not paid for this great film, until other stars do this they'll ""simply never understand the true nature of sacrifice.""",The Wicker Man
297,m-wain,Is it a cult classic? Or is it a classic film about a cult?,9,16 June 2010,"Is it a cult classic? Or is it a classic film about a cult? The truth is that this film is the definition of a British cult classic. Recognition of just how good a film it is was a long time coming but it is now rightly recognised as one of the greatest cult horror films of all time. The plot centres around Sergeant Howie (Edward Woodward) who is sent to a remote Scottish island governed by Lord Summerisle (Christopher Lee) to investigate the disappearance of a missing child. The plot itself sounds simple but in truth the film is a psychedelic erotic trip out from start to finish which is a really overwhelming cinema experience.The film contains stand out performances from both Edward Woodward and Christopher Lee which adds so much depth to the film. Christopher Lee's portrayal of an apparently civilized man being the instigator of these pagan rituals is truly chilling, and equally powerful is Edwar Woowar's reaction to this in playing a Christian upholder of justice. The film is filled with scenes of eroticism and impromptu musical numbers which really should not work, but strangely enough they do. People appearing in strange animal masks should not be terrifying, it should be funny, but it isn't. The film itself is filled with contradictions of the horror genre and is itself a flawed film (hence why I have not given it 100%), but despite this it is still probably the most chilling film of all time and I love it. I love just how flawed it actually is and the fact that it still works.If you have seen this film you will know that this is embodied in the encounter with 'The Wicker Man'; a fun filled occasion of music, dancing and sacrifice.

Having seen this at a time when I was deeply into Paganism, esp Celtic beliefs, I was not offended by it's approach to what paganism could be if left unchecked. It doesn't implicate modern pagans as a catch all tale it stands alone as a good tale with a great twist, and a fantastic soundtrack of wonderful songs. There are two versions available to the buyer and I'd get both as they each have a few scenes unique to the other. this is a gem of a film relegated to cult status (no pun intended, but the irony is there) and worth finding.

In my opinion, if a place like Summerisle ever did exist, a mass B52 napalm attack on the island and all its residence would be in order.ON WITH MY REVIEW.I rented this movie in 1984 and the effect it had on me after watching it lasted for two days. This film really toyed with my emotions. I guess its the way the film dragged me from disliking the character of Sgt. Howie and feeling the peaceful people of Summerisle as being a bit ""picked on"", to ultimately feeling pity for Howie and utter contempt for the islanders. This is one of the brilliant things about this film. Its ability to transform your feelings towards the characters is subtle but still noticeable. If you start watching this movie you will get hooked and drawn in but may wish you had not been. And as the film begins its dash towards its climax, we realize along with Sgt. Howie, that he has made a horrible mistake in coming to Summerisle. This has one of the most jaw dropping and disturbing endings in movie history.

The only redeeming quality of this film is the burning of the ""Christian"" at the end.The audio was rough, at best; I've seen films from the 40s with better sound. The dialogue wasn't of consistent volume, I had to constantly adjust up and down to catch everything, and I still had to replay several portions to hear what was said. The musical breaks hurt the film far more than they helped. Maybe it had something to do with the social movement happening in the UK at the time, but the songs were too loud (comparatively), and seemed to only partially connect to the story.By the end, I was so annoyed by the investigator that I wanted to see him die, horribly. His acting was entirely unbelievable, as was his religious diatribe. When compared to the newer version, the best part about the ending was the victim's prayer for help, though it doesn't hit quite as hard as a man's daughter burning him to death (as in the 2006 version).In retrospect, I would have expected these two films to be juxtaposed, both in time and place of creation. America seems to be the current hot-bed of ""Christian"" propaganda, especially now, so it just makes sense that a contemporary film would retaliate with such anti-Christian sentiment. By comparison, I've not come across any zealots preaching Christian dogma in my times in the UK, though this film leads me to believe that it may have been worse at the time of production.",The Wicker Man

This view was, however, based on the supposedly butchered British Lion cut that has been the most commonly viewed version over the past few decades. Having since seen the extended director's cut, shown recently on Channel 4, I must say that this seems to be restoration for restoration's sake (not unlike the bum-numbing pointlessness of 'Apocalypse Now Redux').Much of what has been placed back into the film is simply unnecessary. the audience does not need to see any of Sgt. Howie's scenes before his arrival on Summerisle (i.e. preaching in the church, and that awfully acted opener in the Police Station). Elsewhere, plot points that were perfectly legible in the shorter cut are hammered home in a way that begins to border on the patronising.And although Christopher Lee complained heavily that many of his supposedly 'character building' scenes were omitted from the 80-odd minute cut, these seem to amount to little more than a few brooding looks and a spot of poetry. Other scenes involving the inhabitants of Summerisle did benefit from being slightly extended, but for me there was probably 5 minutes maximum of film that marked a true improvement.Having studied both cuts of the film now, I'm willing to put my neck out and say that perhaps British Lion had a point.......",The Wicker Man

He finds himself disgusted with the 'religious' beliefs of the island,and what is taught in their schools.Religion seems to be sex related, and Howie, as a Christian, is disgusted. The people of Summerisle hold a sacrificial ceremony(in hope of good crops next year from the gods), which Howie participates in, unknown to them. He then sees Rowan is to be sacrificed and tries to intervene, but things aren't what they seem to be.

Weirdness kicks in at times so it may be too much to handle for viewers who are not used to that kind of films. It really does leave you uncertain until the very end, and that is the beauty of it. The actors are also outstanding, giving you reasons to believe this is real. Landscape does its work, so the visuals of the film are undeniably stunning. Definitely not a horror film though, so do not expect jump scares. Personally, i think songs used to build up the scenes are serving their purpose, they are unexpectedly well timed.

Not this film! It takes values I think most people don't think about and stands them on their head.

Then through trial and tribulations abound, it is revealed to be a great conspiracy committed by the island so as to make a better crop yield in the forthcoming year. Now when I stopped watching that was my general take away from the film; nothing more than basic standard horror fare really, clever plot, but other than that not much else is unique. BUT now that I have had time for the title to stew in my soul a little bit longer, I can't help but have a growing appreciation not only for the film as a standalone entity (the world/lore/etc is all ingeniously intricate and no corners were cut in regards to fleshing out this religion of the islanders). For me though, the greatest takeaway that I've really found is the revelation that Howie wasn't afraid. Not until it was far too late. He was so bull sure of his authority, of his churches authority, of his police badges authority, that he never questioned what would happen if everyone conspired to murder him. The idea of a murder conspiracy is spooky, but what's really horrifying is the fact that this man, who really could be any man, went to this island with certain preconceived notions in regards to the law of the land, and he managed to be completely wrong in every way, and he didn't even notice until he was being burned alive! It really begs the question of what kind of constants we as a race consider permanent and transcendent of culture, because you can swap out Howies beliefs for anyone's beliefs ( a la, your own) and possibly horrifyingly discover you too would be burned alive for stepping on the wrong toes.

322,AholeAndy,What an overrated piece goat cheese.,3,31 March 2010,"I decided to rent The Wicker Man after seeing virtually all good critic reviews , who mostly referred to it as a must-see 70s cult horror classic. Cult horror films have always impressed me, from the low-budget gags of The Evil Dead to the exploitative depraved nature of Cannibal Holocaust and The Last House on the Left. While these films are dark, intense and sometime funny, The Wicker Man not, except maybe a little funny(unintentionally). A Scottish Police Sergeant, played by Edward Woodward, is sent to investigate the disappearance of a local girl on a small island off of mainland Scotland. The people of the community seem a bit strange in contrast to the ""all business"" sergeant Howie. Nobody seems to recognize this girl at first, but the people's stories change as they contradict themselves. Howie's quest soon brings him to the lands mysterious leader Lord Summerisle, played by Christopher Lee(who else?), where he learns the island's pagan history is responsible for the people's promiscuous behavior. The acting is solid by the two leads and the plot is somewhat intriguing. Don't be fooled. They call this a horror, but it's not the least bit scary. The pagan rituals are campy rather than black; like the performances you'd see at amusement parks for kids. They say it's also a thriller, but it's hard to be ""thrilled"" when the plot's laid out so easy and predictable. It's more a musical than anything. They couldn't go 5 minutes without breaking out into some of the worst Scottish folk songs imaginable, singing about the ""corn ring and barley"" or ""the landlord daughter"". The whole film I was waiting for something interesting to happen, but it never comes. No scary atmosphere. No foreboding rhythm. Just song and dance for the whole family.",The Wicker Man

The movie was good as a whole and works best for most of the film as a mystery as to going ons and strangeness of the Summerisle residents and their pagan religion and as to what really happened to Rowan Martin. The film did not scare me but when the end came did very much so shock me and disturb me cause I did not see the end coming like that at all. for a film thats 34 years old to still shock and surprise is a BIG accomplishment which is why its probably a classic. Easily Christopher Lee's best performance as Lord Summerisle. PLOT: A Scottish detective gets a telegram about the disappearance of a young girl named Rowan Martin from the small island Summerisle and goes to investigate. being a devout Christian, he is shocked to goings on of how the towns folk were brought up to believe in the pagan religion and is quite frustrated when no one seems to know Rowan Martin. a well acted convincing film not what I expected but still good just the same. 7/10",The Wicker Man
324,grahammeredithjones,"""The Best British Horror Film""",10,4 February 2005,"This is one of my favourite films. It well deserves its accolade of ""the best British horror film"".It was shown on ITV last new year's eve and I believe the one before. Is this to become a tradition? Interestingly the shorter version was shown the last time rather than the director's cut. I prefer the shorter version (even though the reason for this brevity on its initial release was damage limitation, the producers considering it one of the worst films ever made), because it gives it one of the most beautiful opening scenes of a movie ever, the flight over the Scottish islands with the enchanting folk soundtrack. ""The Wicker Man"" deserves this dramatic beginning, as elucidating as the preamble in the director's cut may be.Whose side are you on personally? Some root for the joyous animist islanders; some egg on the stern but incorruptible ""Christian copper"". Personally, on first viewing, I lost all sympathy with the Islanders upon the revelation that their religion was not something that had somehow survived continuously from the misty past, as I had assumed, but had been imposed on them just a century before by an upper class Victorian eccentric.The conflict between the diametric opposites, the AMBIVALENCE is what makes the film so poignant, and I think a quick look at the background of its creator, the successful screenwriter Anthony Shaffer, is pertinent. Anthony Shaffer was the twin brother of the playwright Peter Shaffer, who later eclipsed him with ""Equus"" and ""Amadeus"", both great plays made into films. In the film of ""Equus"" the shrink played by Richard Burton bemoans the loss of primal ecstasy that curing the boy of his psychosis entails - this is so close to the theme of ""The Wicker Man"". In ""Amadeus"" the contrast is between the pedestrian competence of the dignified Salieri and the divine inspiration of the ribald Mozart (sibling rivalry between A. and P. respectively?)",The Wicker Man
325,apaglia,Questioning Accepted Belief?,10,16 September 2006,"This may come as a bit of a surprise to some, but I don't find The Wicker Man in the least bit uncomfortable to watch or mildly even frightening. Recently, I watched it for perhaps the 6tth or 7th time. All previous attempts have been ended by distraction at various stages of the film. But this time I was able to view it throughout without interruption. So, considering this film's reputation, and after at last giving it my fullest attention, I find that it is not a horror film of the classic genre, and neither is it a real thriller because its pace is so laid back. In fact, in previous partial viewings I've often thought Sergeant Howie should just push off back to the mainland like he is constantly being advised to, and let the Summer-islanders get on with their lives. And I've wondered if it is because I'm not a hard and fast religious person? To me it is no shock at all that the islanders are pagans. If it suits them, then go for it. Not so, Sergeant Howie. All this may make people think (from this review) that there is nothing in the film of worth to titillate or entertain. And that would be completely the wrong conclusion.Don't look for shock value in The Wicker Man. It is a beautifully crafted and complete film that, despite the obvious lack of budget, manages to convey the way of a tight island community. Outsiders are not altogether welcome until, ironically they are, called in by the islanders on a special premise unbeknown to the outsider. And a Christian police officer is the perfect guinea pig. There is plenty of community wit, humour and a prominent celebration of the sexual act. Remember, this is paganism and unlike strict Christian belief, sex is one of the joyous fruits of nature. And it is this celebration of life (and death) that comes through most of the film, to Howie's disgust and later temptation. And it is only in the last 5 minutes or so that the full reason for Howie's presence on Summerisle is revealed to him. And by that time, your sympathies may even have sided with the islanders, despite the dark deed they are about to perform.",The Wicker Man

327,agbwillow,Exceptional British film-making,9,6 November 2006,"The Wicker Man is a great example of how a film can be tossed aside like rubbish, only to emerge in later years as a classic. Although usually billed as a horror, it is only towards the end that a feeling of dread sets in, as the film reaches its conflagrative conclusion. There are many other elements to enjoy along the way - eroticism, comedy and even a sing-a-long with Christopher Lee! The film keeps you off balance throughout - constantly setting up the central character, Edward Woodward's puritanical Sgt Howie, as a figure of ridicule and letting the audience root for Lee's liberal Lord Summerisle and his followers instead. The Wicker Man certainly makes a lie of the theory that only virgins survive in horror films! There is no heroic rescue to save Howie in the end because this is so far removed from your typical Hollywood popcorn movie.This would not be the same film if it were not for the shoestring budget, patchy picture quality and folksy ballads. The soundtrack, by the way, is every bit as quirky yet ethereal as the film and is well worth owning.

330,hitfan,Not what it seems,9,7 August 2009,"I watched ""The Wicker Man"" (the original 1973 film) for the first time a few days ago. I admit, I disliked the movie quite a bit in the first half, trying to make sense of it all.However, the final 20 minutes or so are an awesome spectacle and the weirdness and the flaky hippie atmosphere of the whole thing built up quite nicely to the climax.SPOILER AND ANALYSIS: I was expecting this movie to be a ""pagans=good and misunderstood / Christians=bigoted and intolerant"" type of political screed. Instead, the film kind of takes more of the tack of ""a pox on all their houses"" when it comes to the subject of religion.There have been horror/exploitation movies made about the Inquisition, witch burnings, slavery in the Deep South and Nazi atrocities. I'd like to see one made about atrocities of the Soviet Union (specifically the forced famines of the 1930s).I got into a 'debate' with someone the other day about the root causes of war, and his response was a typical one: ""Religion is the cause of all suffering and misery in the world"". Well, they stripped out religion in the USSR (or at least they tried to) and that society was just as horrific (if not more) than Medieval Europe in terms of misery and death. I think that oppression by the use of religion is just a symptom of the darkness of human nature and it's inclination for social control over others.So I think the film is trying to say that whatever ideology or religion (whether it be Christianity in medieval Europe, forced atheism in the USSR or paganism in an isolated community) would be used by those in charge to maintain control at any cost, even resorting to ""state-sanctioned"" murder. SPOILER WARNING AGAIN: Wicker Man starts off showing many beautiful songs and dances of the old religion and then ends with a horrific human sacrifice--an ironic dichotomy of a Utopia devolving into the worst aspects of all the other idealistic societies.On the flip side, religion/ideology is a necessary evil that maintains social cohesion. Sure, we have pluralism and multiculturalism today, but there are ""anti-hate"" laws in place (state-sanctioned ideology) that force people to get along with each other, for good or bad. It remains to be seen if pluralism (the new religion?) will be able to survive economic collapse.",The Wicker Man

Its considered one of the greatest horror films of all time and its inspired numerous filmmakers and even a terrible remake featuring Nicholas Cage. However, after getting excited and actually watching this movie, I can honestly see why someone at least tried to remake it (though failed humorously at it). The Wicker Man is another one of those over-hyped and over-acclaimed films that generally fails to deliver upon its highly esteemed reputation. Don't get me wrong...this movie, by no means, is horrible....its just.....average. Let's break it down for a minute (no spoilers) :Ok. The acting is great; Edward Woodward does a phenomenal job as Sergeant Howie, the soundtrack is stellar and the premise is promising....but the actual execution is just....., frankly, weak. From the horribly placed and unintentionally comical musical numbers to the wacky pace and over-hyped so-called ""shocking"" ending, the Wicker Man simply fails to deliver that ""it"" factor to make it a true, brilliant classic. And don't get me wrong: The movie wasn't terrible...(frankly, I love the strong religious overtones, bizarre sexual emphasis and lack of violence) Overall, however, it was just half-way decent. P.S. I saw the ""shocking"" ending from a mile away on my first viewing....maybe in '74 that was shocking or something.....I don't know.

336,hauntedriver,Cult British film-making at it's very best,10,26 January 2005,"'The Wicker Man' is - like 'Withnail & I', 'Get Carter' and 'Performance' - quite rightly hailed as a cult Brit classic. The simple fact that this obscure film has attracted well over 200 reviews on the IMDb website is testament to the enduring spell it has cast upon its admirers (either that or it is a testament to the IMDb's popularity). Christopher Lee acclaims it his finest screen performance but Edward Woodward (Sgt Howey) and Lindsey Kemp (the publican) steal the acting honours. And although Britt Ekland appears, her voice was dubbed over and a body double used for the nude scenes (much to her chagrin). Though one must honour screenwriter Anthony Shaffer ('Sleuth', 'Amadeus') and director Robin Hardy too.It's well worth tracking down the original uncut version because it helps establish Sgt Howey's character as a somewhat odd but thoroughly devout Christian. Quite rightly he is considered something of a prude, yet one cannot fault his decency and spiritual integrity. Indeed, this gives the story its backbone of credibility. The tenacious way in which he conducts his investigation whilst the inhabitants of Lord Summerisle's Island play with him like a spider caught in a web is testament to this. As viewers we sense that Howey is anything but paranoid and therein lies the true terror (paranoia being the delusion that 'everyone is out to get you'; clearly this is no delusion).The film possesses a discordant weird ambiance throughout and features a superbly horrific ending. The music perfectly underscores the mood, suggesting a dark Celtish folklore in which pagan rites dominate all spiritual belief. There are many brilliantly evocative images which linger on in the mind of the viewer, including the scene of the naked woman grieving on a tombstone (recalling the Mardi Gras trip scenes from 'Easy Rider'), the naked women jumping through the flames, the insect tied to a pin in a schoolgirl's desk, the inhabitants wearing animal masks, and of course, the final scene in which director Robin Hardy wonderfully juxtaposes the burning sacrificial pyre against the setting sun.According to historians, the lost edits from this were used as filling for a Buckinghamshire road improvement scheme, when boxes of unwanted film reels were crushed up to use as ballast. Even the current extra-length version we now enjoy only exists by accident, after the UK distributors sent US cult director Roger Corman their only fuller length copy, having cut the British version for various reasons. Luckily Corman was impressed with the film and had kept the only longer-length version safe, which is why we can now enjoy an extended, but alas by no means complete, version of this brilliant, brilliant masterpiece.",The Wicker Man
337,wimsattm,"The Wicker Man: Film, Fiction, Fact",10,31 May 2008,"Several comments, in ascending order of importance:First, there are various versions of Robert Burns' poem, ""The Highland Widow's Lament,"" which is sung in the film. Here are some stanzas that differ from those in the film:I was the happiest of the Clan; Sair, fair may I repine; For Donald was the bravest man, And Donald, he was mine.Till Charlie Stewart came at last, Sae far to set us free; My Donald's arm was wanted then, For Scotland and for me.Thou woeful fate what can I tell? Right to the wrong did yield; My Donald and our Country fell Upon Culloden field.Second, the film is excellent. It disturbed me, even though I have known about it and its famous ending for years. Actors and actresses who are not native Scots do a reasonably good job with the distinctive Scottish accent. It is interesting to see the remarkable Christopher Lee as a fairly youthful middle-aged man. It is also interesting to see Edward Woodward, whom I had previously viewed only in 'The Equalizer,' splendidly playing the role of the baffled, ethical Sergeant Howie. The conversations of Lee and Howie are brilliant. The conclusion of the film is terrifying.Third, people who note that the film is dated or that it is not a true horror movie should remember that film dates quickly and that, as other commentators have remarked, The Wicker Man does not fit into any single category, a fact that is one of its strengths.Finally, since much, perhaps most, of my blood is Celtic, I shall make the following observation. Presumably Julius Caesar invented the legend of the Wicker Man in order to convince Rome and its various subjugated colonies that the Celts were more bloodthirsty than the Romans. See the entry in 'Wikipedia,' disambiguation, on this point.",The Wicker Man
338,scott-goring,Think and Enjoy at the same time,10,24 September 2005,"There is an unusual quality about this film. It is a film that almost defiantly refuses to be pegged into any one genre and yet it welcomes viewers who would enjoy films of almost any genre. You can enjoy the police drama, the historical elements, the tests of religious beliefs, the music, the folk lore, and so on and so on. I don't know why The Wicker Man makes me uneasy. There's nothing to be afraid of but as you dig along with the clever copper you start to realize that something very unhealthy is unraveling here. The Wicker Man is not only overlooked, it is practically shunned by so many. Don't be put off by it's unusual appearances, take a look and be taken in.",The Wicker Man
339,UncleJack,Watch the original version first,9,17 June 2007,"This film is certainly not for everyone and I give fair warning to potential viewers. The folk music and the complete absence of blood in what is usually described as an horror will put off a lot of people and the slowness of pace will deter others. But this is an outstanding film.Ostensibly about a missing person investigation, the main theme of the film is in the clash between Christianity and Paganism and their underlying ideas and beliefs. Not the dogma, rites and tradition of Catholicism more often featured in films but hard-headed evangelical Scottish Presbyterian Christianity - no work (and precious little pleasure) on Sunday, no taking the Lord's name in vain, no sex outside marriage and the Bible as the Word of God. The Paganism is well developed too, not just dancing naked round bonfires on Hallowe'en, but fertility rituals, festivals, ceremonies and sacrifice to numerous gods. Lord Summerisle who owns the island is candid that it was his grandfather who introduced Paganism for pragmatic reasons, but this is no made-up religion; instead a return to the old gods of the sun, the sea, fertility and the harvest.To my sometime Christian eyes, the Christianity of the police sergeant is captured perfectly and Pagan islanders seem sinister. Speaking with pagan friends, they welcome the portrayal of the islanders and regard the sergeant with suspicion or as a bigot. So then, is this film some sort of religious drama? No, it is an horror film. Horror can be more than shock or blood.One important point: If you have not seen this film and you get the choice of which version to see, choose the original (short) release. Much has been written about the various versions - the 'Director's Cut' is widely praised and it is interesting to see some deleted scenes - but one thing which seems to have been overlooked by almost all reviewers is that the original cinema release is a masterful piece of editing with a more logical flow, greater subtlety and an outstanding opening sequence. It also has far better picture quality. You can always watch the 'Director's Cut' if you want to see the film again.",The Wicker Man

The film is at different times eerie, beautiful, and frightening.Some of the songs are great.  Willow's haunting song to the sergeant is one of my all-time favorite works of music.  Sadly, I have looked for other work by the performers mentioned in the credits, but have turned up naught.The story is intriguing and disturbing in many different ways.  Regardless of how you take the religious/philosophical aspects of the story, the sort of cultural cross-section it provides is unique and valuable.I recommend any version of this film (I believe there are 3), but I hope that you can find one longer than the 84-minute American release; one of the film's most powerful and beautiful scenes is rather carelessly truncated in the 84-minute version that I own.",The Wicker Man

344,powwowdancer,I rave about this quirky film with good reason!,10,25 September 2002,"This movie has definitely punched a hole in what is expected from horror films!  I loved the strong performances, and unlike the reviewer at the Wicker Man page, I also enjoyed the music and the atmosphere of the film. Christopher Lee gives one of the best performances of his career as Lord Summerisle; the Wicker Man was voted one of the top one hundred most important British films of all time for many a good  reason.  It broke the mold for horror films and it's like hasn't been made since.  I love the ""thinking man's horror film"" gestalt that this film has and the way that things gradually unfold, leading us inexorably towards an emotionally charged, stunning climax.  The seventies kitsch that the site reviewer laments adds immeasurably to the atmosphere of the film for me; an atmosphere which is very earthy and enjoyable.  The characters are very human and vibrant, and all of them are likeable, which is strange all things considered.  I really did like Lord Summerisle.  I liked the sincereity of all the villagers.  This ""likeability"" adds a profound depth to one's sense of shock and horror at the end of the film.  All in all, I must respectfully and quite vigorously disagree with the negative review bestowed upon the Wicker Man at it's page.  I felt compelled to rebut it and to point out that not only did I love this movie, (indeed, it's one of my all time favorites; right up there with Dr. Strangelove and Lawrence Of Arabia), but I enjoyed the music so much that I'm going to buy the CD as soon as it comes out this month!  It's a good, particularly odd and definitely inimitable film with atmosphere and to spare.  The performances are all rock solid, and I'd recommend it VERY HIGHLY to anyone who enjoys either good cinema or a good story!",The Wicker Man
345,Ronnie_Barko,One of the all time great British horror films,9,25 July 2010,"I had seen The Wicker Man twice before. The first time I watched it, when I was about 16 or 17 (I'm 30 now) I just didn't get it, maybe this was because I was at an age when if a film had Christopher Lee in it and was on after midnight, I usually had a pre-conceived idea of what it would contain. I revisited a few years later and upon second viewing I did 'get it'. Watching it for the third time reiterated my opinion that it is one of the great British horror movies.The story centres around a police officer, Sergeant Howie (Edward Woodward) visiting a remote Scottish island, Summerisle, to investigate a report of a missing 12 year old girl. Upon arrival at the island, the islander's all deny any knowledge of the girl's existence, even the woman believed to be her mother. As Howie continues to investigate he begins to discover that all is not quite right on Summerisle, with the villagers seemingly practising their own religion, a lot of which entails highly sexual behaviour, which grates against Sergeant Howie's own strong Christian views. The islanders also seem to all be operating under the orders of the mysterious Lord Summerisle (Christopher Lee). The town's disregard for Howie's authority and religious beliefs causes him to investigate further and when he discovers that the girl must be somewhere on the island, this starts a series of events that lead to a shocking climax.The reason the film works so well is because it eschews a lot of the horror conventions that were common in the era that it was made. Rather than using formulaic devices ('Don't open that door!' etc), the film uses it's location and cast of bizarre characters to create a sense of a creeping and gradual uneasiness. There aren't many moments that will cause you to jump out of your skin but the film contains surreal and disturbing imagery to create a sense of fear within the audience (another film that does this is The Shining). Another aspect of the film that sets it apart from it's peers is the soundtrack, which consists of traditional folk and pagan music that goes well with the films location and imagery, in fact, there are points in the film that almost feel like a musical, which lends itself well to the slightly surreal nature of the movie.What I like about the film is the fact that, as an audience, we are watching the film through the eyes of Sergeant Howie. He appears in every scene and we don't find out any information before he does, so his confusion and intrigue is matched by our own. Another aspect that helps the film work is the location. The fact that all the action takes place on a remote island adds to the fear. Howie arrives by plane, and when he tries to leave the plane has been sabotaged, therefore trapping him and the audience on the island. This is an incredibly effective device which adds to the fear the film contains. Another factor that helps the film is the islander's behaviour towards Howie, they never show any fear or appear to be intimidated by him and treat him with a casual indifference and amusement despite his authority, this gives him (and us) a feeling of powerlessness.I think that the film is about the dangers of organised religion and a clash of ideals and the devastation that these things can cause.It is a very well made film. The direction and cinematography are superb and Woodward and Lee both play their parts with convincing aptitude, the soundtrack is also brilliant too. It also features an incredible final shot too.An excellent and fascinating film 9/10 ...now what's this I hear about a remake?....",The Wicker Man
346,Bourne1886,"Boring, weakly scripted, predictable and overrated.",1,12 March 2012,"I had heard a lot about this film and the premise sounded really good. I then saw that it was being shown on TV, so in the interests of film I recorded it and watched it back the next day. Having read that it was a Horror film, I went in with a little hesitation as I am not a huge horror fan, although I must admit the first Halloween is film gold.I always try to keep an open mind when it comes to watching films and try not to be influenced by other reviews etc, so went into this with that in mind. As I started to watch the film unfold it was obvious from the start where this was going. Basically a Police Sgt is sent to a remote island in Scotland from the main land to investigate the supposed disappearance of a young girl. As soon as the main character arrives you realise he is out of his depth from the beginning. The character Sgt Howie, played by the excellent Edward Woodward believes he is the one in charge and his word is final because he has the law and God on his side, being a devote Christian. He believes he has the moral high ground over the people on the island because as his investigation, which was very poorly executed takes place he discovers a secret society of Pagan worshippers with liberal sex views, who are completely mad. Because he is blinded by faith and incompetence it ends badly.I was not impressed. For a Sgt who is a supervisor, in charge of other officers he never does his pre-investigation ground work or takes any precautions.(This is not seen in the film at any point.) He then travels to a remote island alone,which doesn't having any police presence, with only his uniform, pocket note book, truncheon, handcuffs ( I presume he had his truncheon and handcuffs with him as you are required to have them when on duty- but didn't see them) and mouth, from the mainland and you the viewer are supposed to be surprised when the villagers turn against him. I wasn't. I found the story to be very very weird and slow, boring and poorly executed. It is very undeserving of its cult status. It is not a horror film as some would make you believe and not frightening in the least. The whole premise was spoilt by the weak script. The character of the Sgt was written by someone who clearly doesn't know anything about the police service which served to ruin the story further. My summary says it all.",The Wicker Man
347,warbuch,"Creepy, Unsettling, but Dated",6,27 September 2021,"Creepy flick, but the music, acting, directing/editing all feel dated. The music especially is just...weird. There's one part where it goes into a 70's style rock/jazz fusion thing that is jarring. Some other scenes involve motifs and melodies that come off comical. Intended or not, it's still strange. The acting is also pretty great from the two leads, but everyone else is sorta...meh. Ending is great, obviously, but some scenes are just odd. Like, say, the innkeeper's daughter singing(?) a song to the Sergeant, from the other room.The movie's good, and superbly influential. It deserves the praise it gets and is worth a watch for history's sake, but its impact is lessened ~50 years after it came out by some of the ""1970s-ness"" of it all.",The Wicker Man
348,radditz_13,Not to be placed in the horror genre,6,19 March 2007,"This is not a scary movie.So often Wicker Man is referred to as ""Britain's finest horror movie"", though with its complete lack of terror or suspense, it makes for a poor horror movie.Not to say its a bad film.A bit dated, perhaps, by the rather unusual inclusion of folk songs and dance, the film stands well as an interesting view of clashing ideologies. In this case, a devout Christian man bumbles along stubbornly trying to find a missing girl in a pagan community.The film is more of a view, almost documentary style, of the pagan community and their adoration for nature, sex, and medicines based on a faith in folklore and natural healing. The community, while bizarre and guarded, is typically peaceful and hospitable. Our protagonist, the police inspector, seems thick headed and incapable of comprehending this religion, mixing his own personal beliefs with his investigation of the missing child. It is only in the last few moments of the film where we see a darker side of this community, and a few moments of horror for the doomed officer. So, if you're looking for terror, you'll find little. If you're looking for blood, you'll find none. But if you're looking for an introspection into old beliefs that were once common and now seem unsettling, looking for a film about two religions from one nation being unable to reconcile, looking for a movie about the dangers of a religious community and their actions in times of desperation, you'll find few better than Wicker Man.Highlighted by a great performance by Christopher Lee.",The Wicker Man
349,kingclockwork96,Um...What?,3,2 December 2014,"So I decided to give this a watch, I'd seen the remake of this and thought it was unintentionally funny in a very entertaining way. So out of curiosity I decided to give the original a watch, and all I have to say is... What in god's name is this?I've seen people call this a horror movie, and I'd say it's very very VERY far from that. This movie seems less like a horror film or a thriller and more like a crappy exercise at trying to unsettle you. As I watched this I felt less unsettled and more weirded out, even more weirded out then when I watched the remake. The plot sounds intriguing and starts off very strongly, but as it goes on and you see more of the people on the island it just seems stupid, preachy and even a little pretentious at that. Also something else I really, really really have to complain about is the music score. For a movie that tries so hard to be creepy and bizarre the music score doesn't fit the movie at all. It's surprisingly very upbeat in scenes where you wouldn't expect it too. Did the director listen to the score and think ""Yes! This fits the movie's tone perfectly."" It's a more unfitting score then the score to The Uninvited.The best thing I could say about this movie are the performances from the two leads. Edward Woodward as the police officer Sergeant Howie is perfectly cast and commands a strong presence in every scene he's in, and Christopher Lee is clearly having a blast in the role of Lord Summerisle and does a great job at coming off as charming yet creepy as he always does.I'd strongly suggest not going near this at all. I know this movie is an important part of horror movie history to some people, but I guess not all of history is meant to be good. This gets a 3/10.",The Wicker Man
350,nightshade071,Unlike anything else before or since.,9,23 December 2014,"The first time I watched this I was twelve or thirteen years old (and probably entirely too young, to boot). This remains one of the bleakest movie-watching experiences in memory, almost to the point I couldn't enjoy it... but I sat through (being a long-time fan of Mr. Christopher Lee) and ultimately, I'm glad I did. As I said, it's bleak and dark while being totally hypnotic. Like driving past a car wreck with fresh blood smears on the road, you're horrified but you just can't look away. Lurking beneath the murky surface is a sense of doom. The ending is disturbing in a way I have not seen before or since. I would not call this a horror film - at least, not in the traditional sense of the word. I'm not even sure if it can be probably categorized in one genre or another, and maybe it doesn't need to be. And let me clarify one thing: make no mistake, this is not a fun movie. It's not the thing you pop in when you're bored and looking to absentmindedly waste away an hour and forty minutes. The Wicker Man takes you by the throat with an icy grip and doesn't let go until long after the credits are over, if ever. It will remain with you for a very long time.

It blew me away. 
This is one of very few films that made an impact on me then and to this day 30 years later I still have it up there in my top 10. 
Everything about it for me works. It has a sense of realism, a believable scenario of that time. A unique film, that does not sit into any genre or category. It is very unsettling and for the first view difficult to know where it is going, but you want to stick with it. It builds on and finally grabs you and takes you to its harrowing finale.

352,transcendental_realism,A landmark for cult films,7,8 November 2020,"Wicker man excibits qualities that are rare to find in a Hollywood cult movie or in any cult movie for the matter. There is something truly unique and individual about the aesthetic feel of this movie that makes it stand out as folklorist and outwordly.The movie runs at one and a half hour long and it is really staight to the point from start to finish. (In contrast with the american remake). The opening scene lays out splendidly the psychological structure of an ultra religious catholic cop without even saying a word. It then proceeds directly to our point of interest - the island. Although you could argue that the long music cuts are a bit off putting and make the movie feel a bit over the top and querky I believe that they beautyfully set the pace and the overall atmosphere of the eerie pagan community. The end scene in just a candy for the eyes and doesn't exaggerate the tragic finale but rather leaves us with the a feeling of awe and mystery.The music is another strong aspect of the movie, a psych cult folk masterpiece great for lovers of this post-60s era. Sometimes it's greatest advantage can also turn into a big disadvantage. Considering the level of craftsmanship in these songs it's wierd that Giovani never released anything other than this OST.Christopher Lee delivers the baritone awesomeness that you would have come to expect from him with witty comebacks and remarkable philosophical insights. His monologue in the scene with the slugs is where the films peak for me in terms development of the cult's philosophical background.Having seen the other reruns of this theme (american one, and loosely midsommar) i believe that the lore and the concepts of this movie strike as more folklorish, dark and medieval. The trinity of the fool, the woman and the dragon gives me deep pagan symbolic quality that none of the reruns have.

358,united100,A cult film about cult practices...,9,19 September 2003,"The best British horror film ever made? Probably, yes. The best horror film ever made? No. The best occult thriller ever? Quite possibly.The film was in part conceived as a vehicle for Christopher Lee to get away from his Hammer roles and give him a chance to demonstrate that, yes, he could actually act. Perversely, however, the film is in many ways homage to the films produced by the Hammer studio and is at the same time their antithesis.Although Lee's Lord Summerisle was certainly a stronger character than his Hammer caricatures, and was suitably sincere and sinister, it was left to Edward Woodward's bumbling, pious Highland Police Sergeant to carry the film.The rest of the cast are not as strong as the two central characters. Famously, it was always suggested that Britt Ekland's voice was overdubbed for the entire film. Robin Hardy has now denied that, stating that only her singing was dubbed. Even if the other actors' performances fail to match those of Woodward and Lee, somehow, it doesn't detract from the film.Almost as famous as The Wicker Man itself are the stories surrounding the film. The version first released was almost completely butchered from an original, almost grandiose cut of 102 minutes to a more concise 87. Christopher Lee has always maintained that this was a crime against the greatest piece of art with which he had ever been involved. The original negatives were then accidentally thrown out!When a fuller version finally surfaced in 2001, Lee's contentions were (at least in part) proved. The film was overall improved, and save for a couple of points of rather clumsy editing (the flashbacks Edward Woodward has as the penny drops spring to mind) and the pointless scenes before the flight to the island, it ran more smoothly and made more sense.The film's greatest asset comes through in whichever version you actually see. The eerie sinister atmosphere never fails to be conveyed. Somehow, the fictitious Scottish island setting of Summerisle, which could so easily turn twee at any moment steers clear of the territory occupied by Brigadoon or the now happily deceased BBC TV drama 'Monarch of the Glen'.The setting's remoteness, which could have been its worst enemy, is actually its greatest ally.Perhaps the most interesting thing about the film, however, is the way that it steadfastly refuses to fit precisely into any genre. It is all at once a horror, a thriller and even a musical! Unbelievably, these things come together and fit into the film.The music in The Wicker Man is unique, always adding just the right tone of eeriness or bawdiness to proceedings. A strange mix of elements including traditional folk music, it's as innovative and interesting as the soundtracks to Blade Runner, or The Virgin Suicides. The opening title sequence to the tune of Corn Rigs succeeds in transporting you with the plane over the remote coastal peninsulas and out into the Irish Sea towards Summerisle.My only criticism of the film (and I really am nitpicking here) is the way it goes about establishing Sergeant Howie's Christianity. I can't conceive of the Howie character adhering to any religion other than one of the obscure forms of Presbyterian Protestantism practised in parts of the Highlands of Scotland. These scenes contain an apparent reverence for the sacraments that appears more Catholic in nature. This distinction in religious backgrounds is important to understanding Howie's attitudes. Nevertheless, I am truly nitpicking when I make this criticism!But what ultimately makes this film is its ending. Without giving the game away for those who have not yet seen the film, it is inevitable, and yet wholly unexpected when it finally comes.The Wicker Man would be a classic of its genre - if it had a genre. Instead, it has to be ranked as a classic film.",The Wicker Man
359,matt_shute_07,A true classic,10,13 January 2005,"There are actually two main ""versions"" of this film. The first, heavily cut for its original cinema release, is the one most people have seen. Then there is the fully restored version, all cuts replaced but with a grainy quality that makes them stand out somewhat (the negatives were lost, and so the ""missing"" scenes had to be taken from prints of an older copy).The cut version of the film feels rushed and incomplete in places, and some early character development is lost. I find the complete version significantly more entertaining and satisfying on the whole, despite the quality issues of some of the shots.The Wicker Man is not scary in an obvious way. It's nothing like, say, The Exorcist. The Wicker Man doesn't hit you in the face with horror; it quietly creeps up on you. That creepy feeling dawns on you slowly, and the atmosphere is built up with care. The way all the villagers act indifferently or defensively to the supposed disappearance or murder of a young girl is disturbing, especially as everyone seems to be hiding something - even the girl's classmates.This is one of my main criticisms of the cut (or butchered) version of the film: not quite enough time is given to that subtle process of building up the suspense of the film. Such was the cutting that the two nights Sgt. Howie spends on the island are reduced to a single night, and several entire sequences are lost.The full version, however, is a small masterpiece. The central idea of this closed-off pagan community, generally peaceful but indulging in the occasion ritual of human sacrifice, is delicious. Edward Woodward as Howie is on top acting form, as is Christopher Lee as Lord Summerisle. The ending of The Wicker Man (from which the title gets its name) must go down as one of the most genuinely shocking in cinema history. You just don't expect the main protagonist to come to such a horrific end. Because the film plays it cool up until that point and never goes over the top, the ending also seems harrowingly believable. I also liked the idea that, in terms of what may lie beyond death, both Howie and the villagers get some kind of ""pay-off"" from the ritual. The islanders get the reassurance that their crops will thrive in the coming year, and Howie gets a martyr's death and a kind of sainthood that seems fitting. The film made me think a lot about belief systems - who is to say paganism is less valid than any other system of religion? All religions are sustained by faith and passion rather than reason or evidence.Thought-provoking, strangely beautiful, and just plain creepy, the restored version of The Wicker Man is a must for any horror movie fan's DVD collection. But even if you're not usually a fan of horror, you're likely to take something away from this burnt offering. The word ""classic"" was invented for this brilliant and eccentric film.",The Wicker Man

It was TERRIBLE! Don't waste your time renting this if you are a horror fan or even if you happen to be Pagan! A few words to sum it up: boring, corny, eccentric, unrealistic, and not scary. Also, it was quite predictable. Hmmm, if everyone in the town is a nut, what are the chances the girl won't be one too? When the cop finds her and at first she is smiling, it was obvious she wasn't scared and easy to infer what would happen next. I had heard this had a good ending and even that was far from good- it didn't show anything, only animals screaming and the cop spewing Jesus crap. If what happened at the very end of this movie actually happened to you or someone you know it would obviously suck, but it didn't make for an exciting or creepy movie. All of this was supposed to have been because they couldn't get their crops to grow for one year?! LOL Maybe they had way too much beer at 'Mr. Weirdo's' Inn/Bar- that could have caused most of the stupid things that happened in this movie.I'd recommend Silent Hill instead...it has plot similarities in that a crazy group of people does some very bad things crediting their odd religious beliefs, but has a much better plot, effects, and is genuinely engaging, dark, and creepy- like a nightmare in which you take a trip to Hell itself.",The Wicker Man
363,rockyhorror-1,A crisis of Faith,9,23 January 2007,"This brilliant film is , at it's heart, the best warning against irrational faith I've ever encountered. And I'm not talking about the Pagans.Sergeant Howie (Edward Woodward)a prudish Scottish Policeman, receives a complaint from a resident of Summerisle (a remote island somewhere off the coast of Scotland) about her missing daughter. This precipitates Howie's encounter with the islands ""quaint natives"", back country, rural folk, ""Pagani"", in Latin, and it's not long before the devout Christian copper discovers that they have abandoned Christianity and become exactly that. As the community's leader (a delightful Christopher Lee) calmly explains, Jesus ""Had his shot, and, in modern parlance. . .blew it"" Lee's ancestor rejuvenated the desperate island's economic prospects by introducing a new and hardy strain of fruit, and knowingly attributed his success to his worship of the old Celtic deities who were once reverenced in Britain before the imposition (and eventual adoption) of Christianity. And now, the islanders have not only reclaimed their ancestor's old beliefs, but in the process have ""freed"" themselves from conventional Judaeo-Christian morality, much to Howie's consternation. ""You teach them what? False Medicine! False Religion?"" However, to these islanders, the Celtic Gods are very real, and they are as sincere and unwavering in their beliefs as Howie is in his. The policeman's pursuit of the missing child, affirming repeatedly along the way his complete faith in the right of Christian dogma and morality, will lead him and us to a harrowing end on a windswept cliff at sunset, where we finally realize, too late, that what we might regard as unquestionably true just might not be somewhere else. . . .and that is far more terrifying than any monster could ever be. This film should take on increasing importance in this day and age, where, everyday, we are bombarded with news reports, and in some cases real events in our own backyard involving people whose unwavering belief that what they believe in and do in the name of that belief is right and good end up inflicting irreparable harm on others. And I'm not just talking about suicide bombers. The joy, the utter suety , with which the people of Summerisle go about their May Day festivities at the expense of Seargent Howie is truly one of the most effective pieces of cinema I have seen, and should be a stark warning to any of us, on either side of the fence, who, even in the back of our minds, believe that we alone truly have ""it"" right. Highly recommended, if viewed with an open mind",The Wicker Man

I can't imagine what the fuss is about - the show is dragged out, plot is contrived and just not believable. One you've seen this show, you'll realize you've wasted your time. The story drifts and meanders, and suddenly becomes an odd musical. The situations presented are not in any way believable. Characters are thin and artificial. The entire premise of the show is the conclusion - a big 'gothcha' but it hardly merits a 1/2 hour show, let alone a 2 hour film. Overly deliberate acting and direction create a juvenile ""I know something you don't know"" atmosphere in nearly every scene. This show insults the intelligence with repeated use of nearly identical situations - it's sort of a perverse straight man - funny man act where the funny man is actually a deranged town.

It is well worth seeing, however the second time round it is easier to spot the many flaws in the film, such as the casting of Britt Ekland purely for her body. The other major flaw is the pretty ridiculous twist towards the end, however this can be forgiven as the climax is so unforgettable.Maybe I am being rather too curmudgeonly though, its a terrific film and I very strongly recommend it, just don't go looking for plausibility in the plot like I rather unwisely did on my second viewing.",The Wicker Man

Probably goes to my Horror Top 10 along with Black X-mas, Suspiria, Deep Red, Texas Chainsaw Massacre etc. I did not think of it as a horror film at first, but more of a mystery or occult thriller, but i realized it was in fact deeply unsettling when you think about it. Very emotionally engaging film, almost suggestive, and affected you in a weird way that most movies don't. Works on a deeper/intellectual level as well and seem to explore some very interesting questions, almost making you dizzy when you think about it. Christopher Lee is usually a creepy guy in films but i think this is the creepiest role i have ever seen him in. And Woodward's performance was excellent too, he was simply perfect for the film, as were most of the other performances. I can't say much more, you have to see the film yourselves.I find it hard to rate something like this, (i still don't quite know what hit me) but a perfect 10 would probably be closest.

Easily one of the best horror films of all time, the shock ending is just as effective as the Blair Witch Project and deserves just as much praise. Woodward gives arguably the best performance of his career and Lee is on usual top horror form.

It was incredible.. and I'm not much when it comes to musical or musical-style movies (normally I dislike.)  Edward Woodward is perfect for the role of Sgt. Howie.  Likewise, there could never be anyone else to consider for the role of Lord Summerisle; Christopher Lee was brilliant.  Sadly, I have not been able to find this wonderful movie on DVD, and even more sadly the only VHS copy I've been able to attain is the US version, which is missing what I consider to be important scenes.  Who could *not* be moved by the exchange between Lord Summerisle and Willow, in her window?  (Yeah, Britt Ekland is one hot babe!!)  Or the spoken thoughts of Summerisle after she closed the window?

This is not the only reason to see the movie, though its a pretty strong reason if you're the type who appreciates either form of gender doing unexpected things to the soundtrack of some very lively folk music.Another good reason to see this film is if you like to collect mental images of great hair styles in history. Christopher Lee's coif steals the show, hands down.Aside from the camp aspect, the story has a number of question marks in its plot. In other words, you can't understand why the main character, the investigating sargeant, gets so embroiled in a situation that could easily have been side-stepped with better protocol.That being said, if his protocol had been better we'd not have much of a story at all.Overall The Wicker Man is good for the musical score, film folly and novelty but it is poor as a contender for being called a ""good"" movie.",The Wicker Man

In addition to being practical, it also manages to be poetic in an eerie way no other motion picture has ever captured.  Chris Lee has said this to be his best role, and I agree with him.  Please compare his character as a pagan king with any one of his Dracula roles:  he's much more frightening in drag than he is wearing a cape and brandishing his teeth.

'Sleuth'(1972) (Anthony Schaffer's previous work) is one of my favourite films of all time, and naturally I was quite excited about seeing this film. This film does share some similarities to 'Sleuth'(1972) with regard to sick, violent, and bleak satire, and also, the kind of 'Comedia Del Arte' elements such as the use of theatre masks and colourful, medieval costumes.Edward Woodward is exceptional as Seargeant Howie assigned to find the 'missing girl', and Christopher Lee back again to play another villain.One thing I loved about this film was the constant alienation technique involving song and dance.

I also prefer older movies over current ones. But this one is no contest. Some say Nic Cage over-acted in his performance, but I find it far more relatable than this one -- the scene in the bedroom is over-acting if I've ever seen it.The second half of this film is mostly just the main character repeatedly being shocked that the island inhabitants aren't Christian, and saying ""What about Jebus?!"".This is certainly no masterpiece, and has aged very poorly.

381,wigandjm,Save yourself from the Wicker Man --- Spoiler,1,15 December 2011,"SPOILERS ALERT (if such a terrible movie could in fact be spoiled...) In October I set out to watch the greatest scary movies ever made. Searching the internet I found a list of 50 movies that included the Wicker Man. The synopsis suggested it had potential to be good but in watching it I learned the opposite.The Wicker Man is one of the worst films ever made (more disturbingly, Hollywood decided to remake it with Nicholas Cage decades later). As a horror, mystery, thriller, or any other genre it fails. Even if you were to watch it as a comedy, given how bad it is, you would be disappointed given how dull it is and how its cheesiness just gets on your nerves rather than making you laugh.Filmed largely in daylight, full of singing & dancing, lots of nudity while singing & dancing, and with the villains being too weird to unnerve the audience, there is absolutely nothing scary about say 99% of the movie.Then comes the ending which has a slight touch of horror but it is not enough to redeem the movie and in fact makes the viewer even angrier with the makers of the film. Basically, the main character (Sgt. Howie) is a Christian police officer who goes to an island where a little girl has gone missing to investigate. He encounters a pagan populace worshiping ancient deities and comes to a the conclusion that the girl is to be the blood sacrifice to appease the gods and make the crop yields better next year.The surprise at the end of the movie is that HE is to be the victim and the girl even helps to entrap him when he goes to rescue her at the ceremony at the end. In that moment you the viewer feel a great deal of sympathy for Sergeant Howie as he is dragged off by these deluded townspeople to be burned alive in a ""Wicker Man"" along with various animals in cages. Christopher Lee's character, Lord Summerisle, has pushed this ritual since he fears his town will sacrifice him if the crops fail the next year.This moment is the only good part of the movie but it comes after suffering through nearly an hour and a half of utter crap. There is no suspense until the final moments and because of this you merely feel cheated AND furious at the dark ending. To be frank, the townspeople are extremely irritating and the Sergeant is an idiot (five minutes after arriving in the plane he knew something was wrong with these people yet he went UNARMED to the blood sacrifice to save the girl).This movie could have been saved if as he was being surrounded, Sergeant Howie said 6 words: ""Good thing I brought my gun!"" That would have made the film a bit more like its distant cousin, Hot Fuzz. That is what Wicker Man is: An old version of Hot Fuzz with none of the qualities that make that movie a classic.In closing, if you want a good movie with a small town conspiracy, try the comedies Hot Fuzz & Waking Ned Devine, the horror flicks Population 436 & Sleepy Hollow, or even the television series Twin Peaks. I'm sure there are other works I could mention that are far better. Save yourself from the Wicker Man!",The Wicker Man

The main character, Sergeant Howie, was full of cliché about the typical Christian, that doesn't recognize others people rights to exercise their religion. He almost reminded me some ultra conservative Tea party members, claiming that we are living in Christian country etc. That made me think it was all a joke. Basically it would be a good comedy if they wouldn't burn him in a wicker man. The last part, with the tragic death of Sergeant Howie, turned it from a good comedy into a ... not really scary horror movie, making me thinking ""What a paranoid Christian had written the plot?"" The last episode promotes the idea that we are living in a Christian country and all good people believe in Jesus and those that do not are wicked pagans that are doing human sacrifice on regular basic.

The uniqueness of this movie is the product of such an imaginary mind that you rarely see in movies now a days. No other film in history can even come close to its remarkable achievements. The Wicker Man is a musical delight that has music so fitting it helps you become absorbed into the plot line more easily.This will sound like a bizarre things to say, but I believe you can actually judge someone's intelligence on their opinion of this film, all the people who adore this movie are insightful thinkers and seem to know common sense, all the ones who say its OK, are of average intelligence, all the ones who say its terrible are more than not narrow minded people with no mind to think for themselves, they often favour cloned Hollywood non thinking action movies with no spirit or character.This movie is like the God of all other movies ever made.

Thirdly, his so-called hero, the character we're supposed to root for, is basically an angry nun, expressing his pious disapproval to everyone he meets, and never once shutting up about Jesus.

I believe that if the film had been about any other religious it would not have been allowed to be made. Film writers take a loving pagan religion, and gives it a nasty face to show the world. Judging and giving the wrong view of different religions, to different people is were you get trouble from. This film is very hurtful to true pagans who are good people and do not believe any god would ask for any type of sacrifices. The film did not even perceive these people on this island to be not true pagans with there own agenda.",The Wicker Man

405,jane_dont,Unique and Memorable,8,20 June 2007,"""The Wicker Man"" is a great movie. Not only is it an original subversion of the genre conventions of typical ""horror"" films, but it also subtly incorporates themes much wider than the narrative. The film starts of as Detective Sergeant Howie (Edward Woodward) arrives on a picturesque Scottish island after receiving an anonymous letter telling him that a young girl has been missing for months, so he sets out to find her. But he finds the locals of Summerisle to be uncooperative, and their behaviour - particularly their neopagan religious practices - bizarre and sinister. The film seems to have sparked debate between Pagans and Christians on the board as to which theology the film is advocating, or whether it is scornful to both, but I don't think this really features. ""The Wicker Man"" is a film with no apparent political or strong ideological agenda, and as such it raises more questions than answers. The films rejection of genre markers adds to the neutrality of the way it treats its subjects. This could be in reference to Pagan tradition itself. Whereas Christian teaching suppresses the parts of human nature it finds dark or impure, the sort of beliefs depicted embrace their animalism and celebrate everything that is innate to human beings in their role as part of nature. Sounds fair enough, but in the ending scenes when the animalism of humanity, or ""nature"", is laid bare in all its brutality, the result is disturbing and abhorrent. Despite the moral neutrality of human nature, in most people there is a desire for purity and goodness. Part of the irony of the human psyche is that there are instincts and behaviours clearly ""natural"" - things we were born to be - that are too dark to be embraced or even really accepted by sane people. Woodward's character can be seen as somewhat dour and closed minded, but in the end his adversaries prove his suspicions correct, and the islanders simply come across as sick...forks. In a similar vein, the film plays up the similarities between Christianity and Paganism, yet never quite derides or exalts the concept of Faith. It is faith that seals Detective Howie's fate, but at the same time faith that lends it some dignity. The contrast is enhanced by the setting of the film. Summerisle is at first glance a normal village, and its inhabitants look normal. But the details build up a dreamlike surrealism and confusion - on Summerisle, everyday concepts such as school, church, medicine, childhood and social interaction are subverted from mundane to glaringly abnormal. This gives a disconcerting sense of what it might have felt like when the first Christians set foot in Pagan Britain, and of the subjective nature of normality. By placing a conventional man as the outsider to a strange community, the film creates an empathy with the outsider, contravening the usual character ""roles"" in Horror. ""The Wicker Man"" is in no way typical of a horror movie, not even the murder scene. The fact that such a horrifying act takes place in broad daylight, in the open, by a whole community, and that their emotional reaction to the situation's brutality is so indifferent not only underscores that what's ""natural"" isn't always ""right"" but also triggers questions about the horrors that become accepted in societies. There is nothing like ""The Wicker Man"". For the most part, it is a strange fusion of crime thriller, surreal comedy, musical and (at the climax) epic, and it somehow pulls it off; the overall feel is similar to a disturbing dream that stays with you all through the next day after you wake up. Its weirdness is what makes it work :)",The Wicker Man
406,nakamur21,"A strange, unique film",6,3 November 2006,"I recently viewed this picture for the first time, and let me say, I was entirely surprised by what this film had to offer. Let me just begin by saying that I consider myself not only a horror aficionado, but also a fan of well made movies in general. This film however, I found to be very unmoving.The reasons for my disappointment were not from any usual point of criticism such as poor acting, dialog or directing. I think that anybody who sees this movie would agree that it is strong in all three of these areas, it is just that the end result of the movie leaves the viewer unsuspecting and not entirely prepared for the outcome.The Performances by the actors are excellent and passionate. A movie about a secluded Pagan society set in modern times would be difficult to produce with any believability, but this film manages to pull it off.The characters, especially the police officer and Lord Summersisle are the driving forces creating the tension in this film. As has been previously mentioned by other commentators, the movie just isn't that frightening.In the end, it comes off as less of a horror film, and more of a commentary on the hedonism and social decadence of the modern western world. This is done by contrasting ancient pagan rituals with modern attitudes towards physical and sensual pleasure as well as sexual liberation. This film left me not necessarily upset over the conclusion, but more puzzled as to how and why these people lived the way that they did.Lord Summersisle, if he were such a genius and master manipulator, should have just applied for government farm subsidies in secret so that he could fund his pagan society while keeping everyone else in the dark. i mean, they could still sacrifice and everything.",The Wicker Man

The theme, concepts, background, and history are greatly unrecognized, nevermind the cinematography, This movie is rich in Wiccan/Druidic religion (interesting even if you are not an adherent), and a vast cast of characters.Edward Woodward (later to be the star of the TV series ""Equalizer"") sets the tone as the authority figure. He gives us a point of sanity in the production, as well as a counterpoint to the insanity going on around him and as a touchstone to the viewer. A phenomenal performance as always, Woodward is an unrecognized talent in British acting. Woodward was in middle-age when this was produced, and thus missed his shot at stardom, much to our loss.This movie is a harrowing, bizarre exploration into the man's preoccupation with the occult, a juxtaposition of the Christian religion vs. The earthly religions.The production is rich in symbolism, history, setting and iconography.

409,Dewsword,so much more than horror,10,22 December 2006,"The film is based on a violent incarnation of Wicca - which in itself is an oxymoron. Wicca is a peaceful earth based religion. In the original, they are not saying that modern day pagans living in modern society are violent much less burn any sentient being (any animal be it a chicken or a human) alive. Instead the film makers are using some of the ancient rituals that were bloody when they were believed to have been practiced millenia ago. The society is both hypothetical and isolated. The appeal in the movie is in its quasi Darwinian segregation from our society. They were not subject to the same environmental (or social) pressures that caused change elsewhere in society. It tantalized ones senses in that it emphasized the original use of the rituals that we have reincarnated in our modern life and for those of you that have read Guns, Germs, and Steel, it was almost as if this movie was an inspiration for him (though it was not) but you can see how the needs, rituals, and religions of isolated societies vary from others. To make a plot that is entertaining, thought provoking, and controversial, there is a very dramatic crescendo to the piece. I saw the ending as a metaphor against Christian domination, as he cried out to his god and was not saved. A morbid Daniel and the lion's den. In other words, the original was a good movie if it made you think and a bad movie if you went on emotion alone (and sided against the people in the colony). Hence the reason its a cult classic.

412,elag-nitram,Whimsical Pagan Fest with God-Awful Music,4,31 August 2008,"Perhaps I was expecting something different, but after hearing so many good things about the Wicker Man, I was rather disappointed when I finally saw it. The movie has some good moments, but its whimsical tone and dated 70s sensibilities make it hard to take this story seriously. It's true that the film does not fit well into any one genre, but I would attribute that more to a lack of focus than sheer originality. The film blends police investigation with horror, erotic pagan ritual, and cheesy music and dance. Yes, that's right -- there are several unfortunate sequences featuring really bad New Age folk music presented in a musical theater format. The pagan philosophy is heavy-handed, and much of the film ends up being more comical than it is ominous. I think it would have been much better if they dropped the musical numbers, focused more on the horror elements, and offered Christopher Lee a darker, more menacing role. (For some reason, Lord Summerisle kept reminding me of Willy Wonka.) Of course, the Wicker Man is best remembered for its shocking ending. Indeed, there is an abrupt shift of tone near the end, when we realize that a sacrifice is about to take place and the wicker man is finally revealed. This sequence does evoke an effective sense of horror, however, the film then proceeds rather quickly to its inevitable conclusion. The Wicker Man is not a terrible movie, but it seems more like an interesting relic from the 70s than a timeless classic. Some may find a certain charm in its campiness, or a hint of greatness in the final act, but there is little else to recommend here.",The Wicker Man

Can't you enjoy the film without nit-picking at every little thing which you consider to be a flaw?  Especially since most of the ""things that don't make sense"" you talk about actually do if you put your brain into gear. And of the things that do seem a bit far-fetched, such as the Summerislanders sending Sgt Howie a letter in the hope of him being a virgin.... why not???  Scotland has the most amount of church-goers in the UK, especially in the Highlands and Islands. It is quite credible that a sergeant in the police force would be a middle-aged virgin. And to whoever said ""how could the Summerislanders know he was a virgin?"" - they didnt; that was the whole point of Siren's Song and Gently Johnny.. to ascertain whether he was or not. If it pleases you, why don't you script The Wicker Man II, and just to satisfy yourself you can make it about the West Highland Constabulary's attempts to find out what happened to Sgt Howie? Or here's an idea - why don't you just use your imagination instead?Unless I've overlooked something, the only ""mistake"" as it were, is at night outside the Green Man pub when you can hear cicadas calling.... in Scotland?!?!  But so what, that's just for atmospheric value. The whole film is very eerie and the ending is shocking and simply a very impressive and imposing climax. Dated?  Oh no, it's not a huge Hollywood blockbuster with an all star cast!!  Boo hoo!!  Corny soundtrack?  I think the music in it is wonderfully atmospheric and adds so much to the film. Couldn't Sgt Howie just have pushed the ""flimsy"" Wicker Man over and escaped?  Christ, how many cynical and downright stupid people are there out there?!

As far as a recommendation, I would be hard pressed to recommend this film to anyone except for the true horror buff, and only to them because it's basically required watching. If you're looking for a legitimate ""fear-jerker"", I'd go for The Exorcist or The Shining (1980) or for the true film noir, pick up a copy of Kwaidan (1964 from Japan.)

418,lostsoundsofrubyandgold,incredibly important and overlooked film,10,8 November 2013,"An exercise in atmospheric terror, Hardy's 1973 'The Wicker Man' is of the utmost importance. Despite contrary belief, don't let anyone fool you into thinking this is a horror film, or any sort of genre piece for that matter. It is not. It is also not a psychological thriller. It is a thriller, and it is indeed psychological, but its no 'Seven' or 'Silence of the Lambs' and for a good reason. It is less about being unable to trust one person, and more about being unable to trust anyone. The film begins with a Christian police officer, arriving on duty, at the island of Summersile, a place that appears to be a close, friendly and tight knit island of happy-go-lucky Scots who are all apparently unaware of his reasons for being there. He passes a photograph of a young girl, said to have gone missing, amongst a group of elderly fishermen, who analyze the photograph. They deny knowing said girl so quickly that the viewer immediately grows suspicious. So does the protagonist. The thing that differentiates The Wicker Man from most films of its kind is that our hero is smart. He's quick on his feet and we get the feeling that he feels the same discomfort as we do, as it occurs. There is never an instance where we feel he may make a wrong decision that may deem him dislikable or deserving of his fate. Despite the dramatically stubborn religious pride he wears on his sleeve, we are not prepared to see the wool pulled over his eyes any time soon. He is directed by the fisherman to a small market, owned by the alleged mother of the girl in the photograph (also the woman responsible for writing the SOS). He confronts her, but as we know, the film can't wrap up with a simple, ""It's alright, I found her already, thanks for your help."" She also denies not only writing the letter, but also that the girl in the photograph is her daughter. The paranoia worsens. We see a clearly, logically thinking person begin to stumble over himself, and rightfully so. Every piece of information he is fed seems to contradict the last, and no one seems to have any idea what he is talking about. What adds to the eeriness of the film is that there are no dramatic scenes where characters crack under pressure. There's no 'good cop, bad cop' routine, where civilians of the island are wrongfully interrogated. Instead we see people calmly and cruelly tampering with a sane person's sanity. One big, awful joke is being played on Sergeant Howie, and he's aware of it, too. The point where we begin to feel bad is when the lies and falsities become so convoluted, where we can't really blame him for being tricked. His fate is silently but surely being determined by an entire town's watchfulness and ill-informed belief system. For a good majority of the film we are falling victim to the people of Summersile's joke, too, and hoping for the best. Prior to cell phones, and wi-fi, and just about everything else, Howie has no communication with the outside world. He has traveled long and far to take part in his own torment. It hurts for us, too. This poor chap just wants to do his job and go home, and we know thats not going to happen. I have no intention of saying anymore due to the fact that this film is almost essential to those that prefer discomfort to horror, spooks over scares and atmosphere over guts and gore.",The Wicker Man
419,justkirkers,Brilliant for so many reasons.,10,2 February 2011,"One of the greatest films ever made, and a film that I have seen so many times it amazes me that I don't get bored. You've read loads of reviews already so I'll cut straight to the points others don't usually mention. This is the epic historical battle between Christianity and paganism that has raged for two thousand years, perfectly encapsulated in a two hour movie. The earthy, naturalistic, sexual, hedonistic, amoral, lustful, jocular, deceitful and violent natures of the pagan islanders versus the serious, chaste, courageous, moralistic, steadfast, naive and self-righteous qualities of the Christian Sgt. Howie. The viewer is torn between the two forces throughout till the bitter end. The clash of morals is epitomized in the character of Willow, the landlord's daughter. To the Christian she is a slut and a sly temptress. To the islanders she is as lovely as a spring flower, graciously releasing the young boys of the village from their virginity. It's hilarious how her own father taps out the rhythms on his liquor bottles to the pub singalongs celebrating her carnal virtues. In the school the girls shout out an answer ""Phallic Symbol!!"" with glee as the teacher unashamedly lectures about the role of the penis in their culture, while the boys dance round the maypole singing a song we certainly didn't sing in my village.The folk-rock soundtrack is exceptional and performed by a band put together just for this movie. Try to find anything else by Paul Giovanni or the group Magnet. There's nothing out there. Every song sounds so pure and angelic (except the bawdy ""landlord's daughter"") but when you listen to the lyrics they are often explicitly sexual. A truly great film. However, three little points always annoyed me.1) If the island suffered a bad harvest, would they really bother taking a harvest photo of the May Queen with a few crappy vegetables strewn about? This is so obviously in there to help the plot along.2) The explanation given by Lord SummerIsle of how his grandfather bought the island and re-introduced paganism out of a personal whim and that the islanders took it on because of the success of his new fruit strains. For me it would have been more realistic to say he found the islanders already practicing paganism underground and he banished the Christian clergy for good allowing the old religion to flourish.3) The glee with which all the islanders, bar none, join in the last act. Surely at least one person would have piped up and said ""This is a bit wrong, isn't it?""",The Wicker Man

I would not classify this movie as a horror flick, it is more of thriller although the climax is pretty horrific. The story is slowly paced which lets it build to a dreadful climax, one of the best climaxes I've ever seen in a film. There is hardly any action in this film and what action there is comes in the last 15 minutes but like i said earlier this is a more story driven then action driven film.The late Edward Woodward does a fantastic job playing the staunchly Christian conservative Sgt Howie who is sent to a remote island off the coast of Scotland to investigate the disappearance of a missing girl only to realize that the inhabitants have long ago rejected Christianity and practice the old religion.The still acting Christopher Lee plays Lord Summerisle, the leader of this pagan community who matches wits with Sgt Howie. Lee, who has done a ton of films, considers this role his best (his second best role is playing Mr Flay in Gormenghast) and I would not dispute that. It says much that he was so impressed by the script that he played his role for free. It was also a vehicle for him to keep from being typecast as Hammer's Dracula.Definitely should be part of any movie fans' DVD collection but be advised to get the directors cut",The Wicker Man
422,stevesmith2003,"You follow proceedings within the mind of a ""fool""...",10,11 October 2003,"There is surely no better example in cinema history than the Wicker Man for placing the viewer at the mercy of it's main character, Sergeant Howie. Every scene has Howie delving deeper and deeper into an increasingly complicated set of characters and events, and at all times you are led to believe exactly what he discovers.  Indeed, I am sure every first-time viewer at some stage or other would have had innner thoughts to the tune of ""what the hell is this about"" - just as the poor Sergeant would have!  It is this rare quality in cinematography that makes the eventual outcome as shocking and horrific to the watcher as it is to Howie himself.  He's ended up as the King for a Day - a ""fool"".  So, dear viewer, have you. Brillliant.",The Wicker Man
423,MrFergushill,Not nearly as good as many people make out.,5,18 April 2005,"I have just watched the ""Director's Cut"" version of this film, and it is tempting to play devil's advocate and ask why do so many people think that this film is anything more profound than the story of an exceptionally priggish policeman with an extremely narrow and outmoded (even for the 1970s) take on Christianity on the one hand, and a bunch of stupid weirdos singing silly songs and waving their arms about like crazed chimpanzees? Superimposed on this core content is an excellent performance by Edward Woodward, a reasonably good one by Christopher Lee, the total irrelevance of Britt Ekland (and her admittedly beautiful nude stand-in) and the extremely irritating minor characters and (I'm a Scot) the strange variety of accents.There is some beautiful scenery and an admittedly shocking conclusion leading one either to exclaim ""So what?"" or to wax eloquent about Christ's sacrifice morally inverted, or some such profound thoughts which, truth to say, the content of the film doesn't really merit.Oh, and it is quite funny in places. I could certainly watch it again a number of times, but I suspect that it might just get funnier rather than more shocking and profound. I'll report back differently if otherwise.",The Wicker Man
424,snaeugla,There is more in this movie then the policeman's death,10,27 February 2006,"I've just watched the movie and read most of the comments on it.A few things I would like to discuss and add.First. There is no issue of whether the policeman deserved or not to die. The issue is if he lived up to the king for a day frame. Because they were not looking for someone to sacrifice out of spite, but someone who would live up to the kind of sacrifice they needed. They needed a virgin, a man who believed he had authority when he had not (believing he was a king) and so on. In modern time the sacrificing of people is not accepted but in the time the religion this movie is based on death was a much more common place thing. Life of a human was not raised as highly above the life of an animal as it is now. Death was a much bigger part of life. So to me discussing of whether he deserved to die seems to indicate total disregard of the subject and material of the movie.Second. The movie is to me a masterpiece just because how incredibly historically correct it is down to the most minute details.Third. Although his end was brutal, I was more intrigued by the comical view the picture gives of the common Christian man wandering through a flora of people who have quite a different base of belief than he has, and his total lack of respect, willingness to understand anything about them (even when there were just small differences), inadaptability, and how utterly bewildered he is that someone could be ""not like him"".Fourth. The people in the movie are pagans much like the modern revival once. The differences lie in two main issues. The killing of animals and humans is no more and the sex thing has mostly disappeared, even though they do not have the same rigid sexual views of some other folks.Fifth. If the movie had ended with rain putting out the fire, it would have been like making a movie about the Kennedy assassination and making the bullets miss. Just not right. Pretty, nice and comforting but not right.And I probably have many more observations, but now I must go to sleep.",The Wicker Man
425,clara1200,Only one criticism!!!!,10,7 April 2004,"Anthony Shaffer's ""The Wicker Man"" deserves to be called one of the best British horror films ever made. Shaffer's cleverly written script gives the film an element of dark comedy which become apparent the second time you watch it.In the first few minutes you are sucked in to the lies that the island's inhabitants are harbouring, lines such as ""A missing child is always trouble"" become ironic, as Sergeant Howie is about to realise just how much trouble.....Religion plays a large part in the film as Howie is a very strong Christian and he believes in pantheism, which evidently effects the way he reacts in the situation he is put in. The island's inhabitants are all Pagans and prefer to view Christianity as a ""comparative religion"". As part of Howie's beliefs as a Christian he doesn't believe in sex before marriage but cant bring himself to say the word sex, just as the school teacher cant bring herself to say the word death. She explains that they prefer to think of life as a ""regenerative"" force.The island's inhabitants believe strongly in the forces of nature and doing what comes natural to them is the way in which they choose to live their lives. Images of nature are seen through out the film, such as blossom trees, pregnant women and corn dollies. One of the most important images in the film is the naked women jumping over the Beltane fire as a ritual. Throughout the film sexuality is flaunted right from the moment the land-lord's daughter dances naked outside Sergeant Howie's bedroom. Even the maypole dancers are celebrating fertility as the may pole is a ""phallic symbol"" as the pupils are taught in the school. No one on the island is ashamed of who they are and they don't dismiss sex as they see it as a natural occurrence.Some might argue that Sergeant Howie is punished at the end of the film for not having their values because he is still a virgin. On the other hand he could be being celebrated because he is worthy enough a sacrifice for their ""God"" Nuada, the sun God.The Wicker Man is an interesting film for analysis because there are many different approaches you could take to it probably due to its many themes and wonderfully, original storyline. The one thing you mustn't do when watching this film is try to analyse it from a logical point of view. You could rip any film apart in terms of logic because you have to remember that any fictional film is purely fantasy, even if this one is a sick one.
The only criticism that I could give this film is that the storyline could be very easily ruined for someone from the picture on the front of the video/DVD case which shows the wicker man burning.....which idiot chose that?!?!?They need shooting at dawn....what is the point of watching the film when the ending is broadcast on the front cover?!?hmmmm.....the marketing department were obviously out at lunch when that was being chosen.....However back on track....overall a very stylish, truly British film which will be a cult film for years to come!!!If you haven't already watched it do so....but just don't look at the cover first....hmmmmm...you know my opinion on that....!!!",The Wicker Man
426,louise_eccles,Original musical-horror.,7,8 November 2007,"The Wicker Man is one of those films that leaves a legacy in British horror and it is easy to see why it has left its mark. As far as I know it is the only musical-horror and the jolly Scottish tunes put the audience on edge from the outset. It is certainly original, which is often a risk, but in this case it has certainly paid off and it's success, and recent remake, speaks for its self. It does not attempt to cash in on cheap thrills and jumps but instead aims to build up tension and mystery throughout by creating a society so far from our own which challenges all the taboos. As all the characters are made to seem odd the audience is forced to share PC Howie's sense of isolation which is emphasised through his physical and geographical isolation. The blend of well-known faces, Christopher Lee and Britt Ekland, as well as the Scottish islanders, means the audience doesn't know who to trust or suspect thus increasing the mystery. It's controversial subject matter and imagery have ensured it's success as a cult classic. You don't know what to expect from this film and can never predict what will happen next and that is really all you want from a horror film. If it doesn't sound like a horror film to you just wait until you see the end.",The Wicker Man
427,james-macleod-1,A quite unique Pagan-mystery-horror-thriller,8,31 December 2004,"A quite unique and very creative mystery horror.Superb acting from Edward Woodward as the prim Seargant Howie, and Christopher Lee as Lord Summerisle. Fascinating from start to finish and a real twister of a plot that keeps you hooked right until the final twenty minutes, what appears at first sight to be an innocent search for a missing girl turns into a fascinating exploration of pagan rituals on a remote and sex obsessed Scottish island.One of the best elements of the film is the classic early 70's folk soundtrack which gives indication of how the era in which this was filmed influenced the subject matter.Definitely not a 'horror' in the true sense of the word, but more mysterious and chilling than any gore-fest. A quality piece of cinema!",The Wicker Man
428,office-150,Content not form,4,1 January 2005,"As the story unfolds, as the elusive missing girl takes Sergeant Howie on a journey of discovery through the psychological wilderness of savage paganism, the pleasant exterior of a quiet village community reveals a menacing yet predictable undercurrent of conspiracy. Tribalism and cult sacrifice have been around for centuries and the author kindly treats us to a sacrifice of a different kind at the end. As a Christian who has never seen this film before I found it a rather quaint and retarded exploration of spiritual forces, suggesting as it does, that there is a finality about the ritualistic sacrifice at the end. When of course the opposite is true. There is retribution. So, the film kind of leaves one laughing in the aisles somewhat. A wholly daft film that conveys only half the truth.",The Wicker Man
429,roman-761-216635,An important film that deserves wider recognition,9,10 August 2013,"The Wicker Man 1973 - not to be confused with the horrendous Nicholas Cage remake from 2006.This film is unique in many ways, most importantly breaking convention and crossing genres in a fashion unseen at the time. Christopher Lee acted his part Pro-Bono as he saw the potential. Interestingly he is a central character, referred to from the beginning, but not actually seen until halfway through. The Wicker Man combines horror, spiritualism, music and eroticism in a seamless and beautiful way to truly form a work of art. It pushes the envelope of these themes, even by today's standards and deserves to be more widely recognized. I would highly recommend this film. 9/10",The Wicker Man
430,SummerisleTourismSociety,All Hail The Wicker Man!!!,10,29 September 2013,I first saw the 2006 film unaware that it was a remake and was inturgied by the general story but thought the film was awful. I later learned of the original film from 1973. Thank the old gods that i did!!!! This for me is hands down the most amazing film of all time!! Wonderful story and wonderful cast. Christopher Lee gives the greatest performance of his career and that is saying a lot. Robin Hardy and Anthony Shaffer did and incredible job telling this tale of pagan ritual and horror. Edward Woodward does a magnificent job as the naive devout Christian Sergent Howie. By far my favorite film of all time!! Forget the terrible remake(if u can) and make an appointment to see The Wicker Man.,The Wicker Man
431,alastwhore,One of the most overrated films of all time.,1,4 October 2016,"This is definitely one of the worst movies I have ever seen. At the ending, I was very confused as to what I should take away from it. That Christians are pure and above reproach and pagans are evil? Is there even an underlying theme to this movie? If so, it was completely lost on me having to sit through all its incredibly dull scenes. Where were the ""subtle chills and thrills"" that all the reviews for this movie talked about? I think by ""subtle"" they actually meant ""completely nonexistent."" This definitely shouldn't be classified as a horror movie, more like a mystery. But it raises far more questions that it actually answers. I guess the mystery is supposed to be ""what was the point of all that?"" To which, you won't get an answer.",The Wicker Man
432,haute-vulgarisation,Go!,10,13 April 2005,"This movie is a work of weirdo genius. It's a pagan/horror/thriller/musical and the Jesus-fueled cop gets burned up in some type of anthropomorphic structure that appears to be made of wicker. And I'm not giving the ending away, because the title suggests the outcome. The music is incredible and Christopher Lee sings and wears one of those plaid lady's dresses that Scottish men wear. Also, there are bunny masks, foxy chicks that are nekkid, palm trees, a seaplane and the best maypole ever. If you don't see this flick, you are doing a grave injustice unto yourself and you really need to hang your head in shame.

This is not the case for this movie, the genre ""horror"" isn't even close to being a accurate label for this title (I wouldn't label this movie).To go into depth, there are some subtle things about this movie. which tells a much deeper story than the one i instantly perceived after watching it once through. Something was hovering in my unconscious. Something that, at the time i didn't think about or even know about. Using some skills i've picked up from evolutionary psychology, I was able to get to the bottom of this. This movie actually has 2 stories, the first one being the surface story (the plot, the climax, the ending, the dialogue etc..) The second story told in the shadows, is the dark mythology of the human species. We can see 2 very different philosophies and thoughts of spirituality collide, none of them which is the good one or the other the bad one. none of them is the right one or the other the wrong one. its up to how the viewer perceive it.(or judges it, if you're a dick)This is one of the most authentic motion picture i have ever seen.

Lovely scenery of the Scottish lowlands and wonderful exposure to the Scottish people. But, come on folks, a ""horror, mystery"", really? Where was the horror? In the last few minutes when Sergeant Howie is about to be burned to death as he appeals to his god for salvation? That's it!? If the rituals depicted are indeed from Summerisle, they're educational in the context of Scottish history and tradition for that area. Otherwise, they are opportunities for displays of nude women, about which I am not opposed, but have no purpose other than their exposure.

I have watched many average to mediocre horror movies on Netflix that were far superior to this terrible film. Do not waste your time.Not only was the story uninteresting, but then there is a crazy dancing Britt Ekland interlude. Instead of wasting my time on The Wicker Man, I would rather watch any of the ""Insidious"" or ""The Conjuring"" movies, or even ""Sinister"" or ""The Woman in Black"".

438,pthorn01,Sheer genius - one of the greatest British films of the 20th Century,9,16 November 2005,"A truly fantastic film, epic in its dimensions and symbolism - which is matched only by the tortured history of its original cut release in 1973. This is a masterpiece of genreless-filmaking and it is profoundly psychological and questioning of religion and morality. There are masterful and inspired performances by Christopher Lee as Lord Summerisle and Edward Woodward as Sergeant Howie and the script by Anthony Shaffer is intelligent and incisive (Christopher Lee has said this was one of the best scripts he has ever worked with - and he has been involved in almost 300 films!)If possible, try to get the 2-Disc 'Directors Cut' version - I think it may be available in the US, and it certainly is in the UK (e.g. from Amazon) This DVD is the definitive version - it includes the original (butchered) theatrical release (84 minutes) as well as the vastly superior Director's Cut (99 minutes). There is also a 35-minute documentary which is excellent, revealing many nuggets about the film and also the cast and crew's frustration with the original cut version. There is also a 25-minute interview with Christopher Lee from the 1970s, theatrical trailer and a fascinating 2001 feature-length commentary with Christopher Lee, Edward Woodward and the director Robin Hardy. There is also a wealth of information and fansites out there on the internet - I've spent many a happy hour researching the film! :)In short, you owe it to yourself to watch this film! I would place it (as many critics do) in the same as legendary films like Citizen Kane. Simply brilliant and I only hope that it inspires others to make similarly original films rather than the usual derivative dross we have today (which the upcoming 2006 re-make with Nicholas Cage may well be).",The Wicker Man

As a normal teenager I have to confess my first attraction was the promise of seeing Britt Ekland wearing nothing but a smile. However on viewing this spiritually haunting film I was fascinated by its pure originality. Having been to many of the locations before its production I felt almost as if I were part of it. I live less than 10 miles from Culzean Castle (home of Lord Summerisle), and know Kirkcudbrightshire very well indeed. I have stood on the very cliff at Burrowhead and watched the sun dip into the sea. Living as I do in relatively close proximity to many of the locations I am looking forward a visit this summer to Plockton on the western mainland opposite the Isle of Skye and to explore and soak up the atmosphere of the place. I feel I would be safe from a similar fate which was bestowed upon the unfortunate Sergeant Howie as I cannot be a true Christian as I would not have been so hesitant in nipping in to see Willow next door in the Green Man!!!

It is about a close-knit community that hides evil. Something is wrong with the community, even though everyone puts on a cheery face. (Sort of like ""The Stepford Wives,"" I guess, if it were set in a small town instead of suburbia.) You know that it's hiding some evil but are unsure of what exactly it is. Who holds evil intentions? How many people in the community are conspiring against you?

This was the one that looked terrible. Some People say that you shouldn't judge a book by it's cover, but this is a movie, and we should have judged it more harsh than we did because watching this movie literally brought me close to tears. It's terrible acting, slow as glass plot, yes glass, and even stranger events made this movie as terrible as it was. The plot was somewhat interesting could have been done in a 25 minute movie, but was drawn out with scenes of naked 13 year old girls running around in circles and idiot saying that they are powerful trouts of wisdom. WTF? Whenever someone says ""blabla bla was the worst movie I have ever seen,"" I simply reply, ""Well obviously you have never seen Wicker Man."" Nicky Cage is remaking this movie, and hopefully at the end of it he doesn't sit in the wicker statue and cry while he is burned to death, while and 10 year old boy could easily break the door that is made of little sticks the diameter of a quarter. This movie is terrible and Nick Cage must have been on some coke when he signed up to remake this ""film"" as some may call it. I thought it was cool how the guy who played Count Dooku from Star Wars I-III was in it. None-the-less, people who gave this movie a 10 were probably in it, or part of the cast, and wanted you to see the film under the slight chance you will make it to the end to see their pathetic name in the credits.

443,cliff-wade,The Truth About the Wicker Man,7,1 March 2006,"I saw this film for the first time recently, and was intrigued by the themes in the film, notably the information on pagan philosophy etc.I will not comment on the technical aspects of the film, as they have been covered in other reviews, though I must say I thought Woodward in particular played his role very well.I think any viewer knew ""something bad"" was in store for Howie when his seaplane failed to start when he wanted to return to the mainland for reinforcements ! What I do want to say is this. I am a Christian, and for me the most ironic part of the whole film was when the pagan Lord (Christopher Lee) said to Howie ""you know nothing about real sacrifice."" The great irony is that Howie knew more about real sacrifice than ANY of the island people, as he knew the Lord Jesus Christ had died for his sins in His sacrificial death. And that though he died a painful death, Howie ultimately had the ""last laugh"" as he would be with the Lord forever...whereas unless the pagans repented of their evil deeds, they would be damned forever.I think the film makers ""acknowledged"" something of this when we see Howie about to die in the Wicker Man at the end of the film. Although the islanders were celebrating etc we also see Howie praying and praising God, knowing that when he died he would be with the Lord Jesus Christ. And I believe the film-makers captured something of this paradoxical hope and joy that Howie had. (Reminded me of the Protestant martyrs who were burnt at the stake under Queen Mary.) I also appreciated the tactic Howie used to try and appeal to the islanders when he was about to be taken to his death. He appealed to them that by killing him would NOT guarantee a good harvest - and then he used the tactic of saying ""and if you do not get a good harvest, then next year you will have to sacrifice your leader"" (referring to Christopher Lee.) For a few seconds, you could see Lee realising what Howie said was true, and had a look of fear - but quickly hid this by saying ""but we WILL get a good harvest this year !"" and then encouraging everyone to continue taking Howie to his death.So, I think the real twist of this film is that though the islanders SEEM to have won, it is actually Howie who gets the real victory.",The Wicker Man
