0,bkoganbing,A Zoo for Mee and you.,8,20 May 2012,"Matt Damon stars in a wonderful family film where he plays a widower dad who buys a zoo on life support. Rather We Bought A Zoo since it becomes a project for the whole Mee family that includes his son and daughter. It turns out to be a learning and healing experience all around.All this because Damon wants to get away from all memories associated with his late wife. So the family Mee packs up kit and kaboodle and moves out to the country where he buys a ramshackle country estate type of dwelling. The house is on a large piece of property which contains a zoo. Instinct tells Damon to move in and try and save the animals there.Zoos are a lot of fun, but when man takes the animals from the wild he assumes their responsibility. It's a lesson that Damon's character Benjamin Mee learns and while it would be easy to dump the animals to a euthanistic fate probably, it would be ducking a responsibility. And the responsibility that the Mee family comes to love and rejoice in.Helping Damon out is his staff that includes Scarlett Johansson as the zoo keeper. She gets Damon out of widower funk as well.Young Colin Ford as Damon's son is well cast and a lot of that is due to him really resembling Damon at an age before he was playing Will Hunting. I'm sure up the family tree you'll find them related if you do a genealogical trace for both. He's got some real relocation issues, but in time he comes around.Definitely either buy or rent this DVD. It has to be in Red Box by now.",We Bought a Zoo
1,SnoopyStyle,well-made nothing-new feel-good movie,7,18 August 2013,"Benjamin Mee (Matt Damon) is still struggling with the loss of his wife. His son Dylan has been expeled from school. He decides to move his family. His daughter Rosie likes one house but it comes with a zoo. His brother Duncan (Thomas Haden Church) does not approve of the purchase. Kelly Foster (Scarlett Johansson) is the head zookeeper. Her cousin Lily Miska (Elle Fanning) falls for Dylan.Cameron Crowe wrote/directed a functional traditional by-the-book feel-good movie. Thankfully, he's a pro and he's good at what he does because this is not exceptional or original. It's just good work. Same goes for Matt Damon and everybody in the film. The little girl is super cute. The boy is a grumpy teen. Scarlett is way too hot to be a zoo-nerd. Elle Fanning is a down to earth sweetie. All the cliché are here including an evil usurper and a fight to overcome great obstacles.It may be a disappointment for those who pine for something special from Cameron Crowe. The problem is that there's only so many personal stories. I doubt Cameron ever bought a zoo or run anything like a zoo. This movie just doesn't have the personal touch, and it feels like a well written sitcom.",We Bought a Zoo
2,Prismark10,Zookeeper,6,5 December 2013,"We Bought a Zoo is based on true events. It is an adaptation of British journalist Benjamin Mee's autobiography who bought a zoo in Dartmoor, Great Britain.The story is transplanted to the USA.Cameron Crowe is a director who has his detractors and in some cases rightly so. Matt Damon is the grieving widower who makes the unusual decision to buy a house in the country with a run down zoo attached.His young daughter is ecstatic about this, his teenage son less so. His brother thinks he is crazy and the staff at the zoo are suspicious of his motives and whether he will be able to stick around for the long run when things get tough.Of course it is a tale of overcoming adversity. The zoo needs upgrading, he is bleeding his savings, there are some old animals and they need to pass the safety audit before it can open to the public.There is also potential for some romance with Scarlett Johansson.There is a lot of warmth in the story and the performances are heartfelt. It is also lazily predictable, you know where this is going and how its going to end with little room for surprises.",We Bought a Zoo
3,kosmasp,Crowe made a movie about a zoo,6,8 May 2013,"Cameron Crowe is a good director. Even a ridiculous plot like the one we get served here, is handled with great care. Of course he knows that you have to make it as light as possible and make fun of yourself too. Matt Damon is a good choice as a main actor. I like Scarlett too, but she's too obvious and the chemistry isn't perfect. It does build throughout the movie and she also spells out why she doesn't live another life, but it's all too shallow.There is also a scene, where Scarlett does a really good speech with a question towards Matt Damons character. Unfortunately the scene is not being resolved properly. Mood changes are a bit too sudden too and the story is filled with cliché. Nonetheless, the movie has a lot of heart and it's obvious that the actors had a lot of fun making it. A decent little movie, that will spark more with certain people than others. It's fun, it's light, if that floats your boat, go ahead and watch it",We Bought a Zoo
4,classicsoncall,"""We walk with lions.""",8,8 September 2014,"Is there anyone alive who ever grew up not liking animals? I have to admit, the plot sounded kind of far fetched but it was actually inspired by a true story, so who can argue with that? I liked the movie and was kind of surprised to see some of the negative reviews here, the ones that get hateful for a movie that's apparently made as a feel good film. Yeah it tugs at the heartstrings and may seem manipulative during some scenes but it's got an inspiring message of working hard, aspiring toward a dream and sharing love with family and friends. That can't be all bad. Let's face it, life throws some major curve balls at you sometimes and it's up to every one of us to pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off and carry on the best way we can. That's the message here and I think it works. Give the film a try. I don't know about the depressed bear though, is that really possible?",We Bought a Zoo
5,jboothmillard,We Bought a Zoo,5,24 February 2013,"From director Cameron Crowe (Say Anything..., Jerry Maguire, Almost Famous), I saw the trailer for this film based on a true story a few times, it looked like easy to swallow entertainment, I didn't know if it would be too cheesy or not but I was up for seeing it. Basically Benjamin Mee (Matt Damon) has suffered the sad death of his wife Katherine (Stephanie Szostak), and the mother to his two children Rosie (Maggie Elizabeth Jones) and Dylan (Colin Ford), and he decides that they should move and start a new life, so he starts looking for new houses. He is shown around one good looking and not too expensive property by estate agent Mr. Stevens (J.B. Smoove), but he reveals that it is a zoo with many breeds of animals, many endangered, his daughter is excited about the idea and her father goes ahead with the purchase, but his son is unhappy and can only retreat and to do artwork. Benjamin sets about to help the zoo go ahead with desperately needed renovation, head keep Kelly Foster (Scarlett Johansson) and the staff get to know him and the family and are happy to help bring back business, but slowly they realise the financial trouble is building because of the inexperienced new owner. Rosie is still obviously happy with the new surroundings and being near the animals, and Dylan may be coming out of his shell being with new friend Lily Miska (Super 8's Elle Fanning) who has a crush on him which he does not know about, but he is happy that the zoo losing its money may need to be sold, she is upset about it. The situation may change though when Benjamin discovers he was left some money by his late mother, he decides to ""follow his hear"" and spend it on rescuing the zoo, the staff and Kelly are delighted about this, but he and his son have an argument about it. The next day the father and son forgive each other, and Dylan confesses he misses Lilly and finding her tells her he loves her, and he is happy to help the zoo finish all preparations for a potential reopening to the public, and they are lucky to gain the approval of the strict and picky inspector. Benjamin, his brother Duncan (Thomas Haden Church), Kelly who has slowly started to fall in love with him, and the staff are all ready to let the people in for the opening, but the this is threatened by a storm, but they escape this, but there are no people coming into the zoo. It turns out there are hundreds of people waiting outside behind a tree that fell into the road, they think it is closed, but the crew come over the branch and confirm the zoo is open, all the visitors are happy with the renovations and to see the animals, Kelly confesses her feelings for Benjamin, and they eventually kiss, and the end of the film sees him and his children able to move on after visiting the place where the father and mother first met. Also starring Patrick Fugit as Robin Jones, Braveheart's Angus Macfadyen as Peter MacCready and The Mask's Peter Riegert as Delbert McGinty. Damon gives a relatively good performance as the father who wants a good life for his kids and try and get over the death of his wife, Johansson is nice as the woman who eventually couples with him, and the supporting cast members are all fine as well, the story is really simple with no need for big moments, it is light-hearted and sentimental, but on a gentle level, and there are some small funny bits, so that the whole family can have some fun, a not bad comedy drama. Worth watching!",We Bought a Zoo
6,tavm,We Bought a Zoo is a nice heartwarming family drama starring Matt Damon and directed by Cameron Crowe,7,12 January 2012,"A heartwarming family drama was not something I expected from either Matt Damon or director Cameron Crowe but when I ended up watching this with my movie theatre-working friend today, that's what I got and to tell the truth, I actually liked what I saw. Whatever conflict arises in such a not-so-intense film mostly arises between that of Damon and his teenage son who hasn't completely gotten over the death of his mother. There's also some amusing scenes featuring that of the inspector played by John Michael Higgins. Oh, and Scarlett Johansson as the potential love interest was also pretty good. Really, all I'll say now is if you like this kind of thing, I highly recommend We Bought a Zoo.",We Bought a Zoo
7,michaelRokeefe,Leave the city; buy a zoo!,7,8 February 2017,"A feel good movie directed by Cameron Crowe, who also co-wrote the screenplay.Full of positivity, empathy and new found love. Benjamin Mee (Matt Damon), following the death of his wife and his 14-year-old son, Dylan (Colin Ford), being expelled from school, decides to get a brand new start and looks for new surroundings. He has always been an adventurous soul and he is ready to take Dylan and and his little sister Rosie (Maggie Elizabeth Jones) to their new home...it just happens to be part of a down-on-its-luck zoo. Yes, zoo with a very attractive head zookeeper, Kelly Foster (Scarlett Johansson). Mee's big brother, Duncan (Thomas Haden Church), reluctantly becomes a believer in the adventure. Kelly's zoo-keeping skills and Benjamin's finances are needed to make a go of the zoo and the Mee family.Also in the cast: John Michael Higgins, Angus Macfadyen, Patrick Fugit and and the very impressive Elle Fanning. This happy, venture into the rebuilding of a zoo is accompanied with a pleasant soundtrack featuring: Cat Stevens, Neil Young, Isley Brothers, Bob Dylan and Echo and The Bunnymen.My only complaint: not enough sparks flying between Damon and Miss Johansson (who is too beautiful playing plain Jane).",We Bought a Zoo
8,sunwarrior13,Matt Damon Makes A Good Central Character,9,5 April 2013,"We Bought a Zoo is a family film based on the memoir of the same title by Benjamin Mee that tells about an amazing and true story about a single dad who decides his family needs a fresh start, so he and his two children move to the most unlikely of places: a zoo.It stars Matt Damon as Benjamin Mee together with Scarlett Johansson,Thomas Haden Church,Patrick Fugit,Elle Fanning and John Michael Higgins.Cameron Crowe directed it.Recently widowed Benjamin Mee, still grieving his loss and dealing with school behavior issues with his 14-year-old son, Dylan, decides to get a fresh start by buying a new house. After touring many houses with his daughter, Rosie and his realtor and finding none to his liking, his daughter finds a paper with what seems like the perfect house he is wanting. They drive up on a beautiful old large house and as Ben inspects the property and tells his realtor it's the perfect home, the realtor tries to explain that the situation is ""complicated"", when they hear a lion roar outside. The realtor explains that the house comes with a zoo in the back and if they want the house, they have to buy the zoo, which closed to the public several years before. Although reluctant to take on a zoo and all of its animals, he decides to give it a try.With the help of an eclectic staff, and with many misadventures along the way, the family works to return the dilapidated zoo to its former wonder and glory.The movie has animals, kids and fine acting from but it lacks the emotional honesty and unpredictability that Crowe's movie are known for.A muddled focus keeps it from being a guaranteed hit with kids or a captivating adult drama but there are enough compelling moments to make it worthwhile.Nevertheless,Damon makes for a sympathetic central character despite the fact that nothing that happens in it is in the least surprising, but it's all quite pleasant and even, at times, moving.",We Bought a Zoo
9,grantss,Good but not great,7,12 February 2017,"Benjamin Mee (Matt Damon) moves his family to an unusual home - a zoo. A journey of personal discovery ensues.Good, but not great, light-drama from Cameron Crowe. No frills plot, based more around characters than story. Story is sweet, almost Disneyish. However, does feel a bit trite and unoriginal at times and doesn't really provide a profound conclusion. This said, this movie is more about the journey than the destination.Solid performances from Matt Damon, Scarlett Johansson, Thomas Haden Church and the supporting cast.Excellent soundtrack, as you would expect from Cameron Crowe.",We Bought a Zoo
10,george.schmidt,Why Not. Why Not indeed! :D Damon & Crowe make the most of this dramedy of change.,8,13 January 2012,"WE BOUGHT A ZOO (2011) *** Matt Damon, Scarlett Johansson, Thomas Haden Church, Colin Ford, Maggie Elizabeth Jones, Angus Macfadyen, Patrick Fugit, John Michael Higgins, Elle Fanning, Carla Gallo, JB Smoove, Stephanie Szostak, Peter Riegert, Lauren Sanchez. Widowed father Benjamin Mee (Damon in a heartfelt low-key performance) uproots his grieving family and, on a seeming-whim – buys a dilapidated zoo – while attempting to cope with their devastating loss, embarking on a new life chapter. Filmmaker Cameron Crowe – who co-adapted Mee's book with Aline Brush McKenna - tries a-might-too-hard with the metaphors (dying zoo/re-born family) but his heart – and the film as a whole – is in the right place. With its Disney-lite tone and amiable cast of misfits the storyline is a bit disjointed with its tone (i.e. the wrongly underscored with rock guitar solo for cartoon-villain Higgins as an obnoxious park inspector) but hits the marks in how each character is dealing with their new situation and Jones is the most adorable tyke on the big screen yet. Best bit : a loving montage of Damon's ethereal wife (the beguiling Szostak) comes to life from his MAC photo album and the film's central them in two words: Why Not. Why Not indeed! :D",We Bought a Zoo
11,neil-476,Entertaining and not excessively treacly,8,20 March 2012,"Following the death of his wife 6 months earlier, and the expulsion of his troubled 13 year old son Dylan from school, Benjamin Mee (Matt Damon) quits his job, sells his house, and makes a new start elsewhere with both children (he also has a 7-year old daughter, Rosie). The extensive property in the country is a small and run-down zoo, and Benjamin finds trouble assailing him from various quarters: there is a lot of work to be done, money runs out, the zoo inspector is hostile and looks to fail them so that they cannot open to the public, and Dylan adds resentment over being uprooted to the difficulty he has in dealing with his grief. Looking on the bright side, the zoo staff are stalwarts and, even glammed down, head zookeeper Kelly (Scarlett Johannson) is worth a second look.Even though it is based on the book by the real-life Benjamin Mee, sufficient major elements have been changed to enable one to state that this is essentially a work of fiction. And it works well as an entertaining story with an emotional core to it. There is sentimentality, it is true, but it is held in check enough so that it is not dangerous to diabetics. Benjamin's cute moppet daughter (Maggie Elizabeth Jones) is truly very cute indeed, but not to the extent that she induces vomiting. Dylan's troubled feelings engage you but don't overwhelm the film, although I felt they were rather glibly resolved when the movie settles down for a happy Hollywood ending (having said that, is there any reason why films shouldn't have happy Hollywood endings? This one almost demands it). And Damon simply radiates decency - you root for him all the way through.Thomas Haden Church, as Benjamin's cynical brother Duncan, gets all the best lines.Interestingly, I felt that this film shared something with Up - one of the main characters dies at the start, but is nevertheless very present all the way through the film by virtue of the gap her absence leaves.Rather undemanding it might be, but I enjoyed this film very much nonetheless.",We Bought a Zoo
12,ferguson-6,"Like the Animals, Love the People",7,11 December 2011,"Greetings again from the darkness. Director Cameron Crowe has finally emerged from his cocoon - 7 years after the abysmal Elizabethtown. Yes, he has had a couple of projects in that time, notably the Pearl Jam documentary, but he has avoided anything related to his dramatic film roots of which produced ""Say Anything"", ""Jerry Maguire"" and ""Almost Famous"". This time he delivers a feel good, family appropriate, sentimental crowd-pleaser that should play very well to the holiday crowd.Please know I do not use ""sentimental"" as a derogatory term. Sure there are moments where the actions and dialogue seem contrived and manipulative, but some of the best crowd-pleasers throughout Hollywood history have these same traits. This film is based on a true story and uses Benjamin Mee's autobiographical book as the basic source material. The real Mee family and their zoo, are stationed in England, not southern California as Crowe presents them. What I can tell you is that this version of the Mee family and the zoo staff is interesting and entertaining, even if you just have to let go and allow yourself to be guided through.Matt Damon plays Benjamin Mee and the story picks up after his wife dies. He soon quits his job and moves his two kids to the country so they can work through their grief and start fresh. His teenage son Dylan is played with blazing anger by the talented Colin Ford. The precocious 7 year old daughter is played by scene-stealer Maggie Elizabeth Jones. This family experiences the realities of struggling with their pain and difficulties in communicating.As for the zoo, it is in major disrepair and in danger of closing if it doesn't pass its pending inspection. Benjamin works with the rag-tag staff, including head zookeeper Kelly (Scarlett Johansson), to bring the facility up to code and nurse the sick animals back to health. As the zoo is rehabbed, so are the individuals. No surprise there.The main conflict in the story comes from the hard-headedness of Benjamin and Dylan, as they ignore their inability to communicate and connect as father and son. A couple of their scenes together are the best in the film for acting and realistic dialogue. At the same time, Kelly acts as a quasi-love interest for Benjamin, while Lily (Elle Fanning) uses puppy love to help Dylan through his misery. That sub-plot is where Crowe missed a real chance. Ms. Fanning is one of the top young actresses working today and her contributions here are limited to that luminescent smile.The wild cast of supporting actors includes wise-cracking Thomas Haden Church as Benjamin's brother, JB Smoove as the Realtor, Peter Riegert as Mee's editor, Patrick Fugit (from Almost Famous) as the guy with a monkey on his shoulder, Angus Macfadyen as the colorful zoo maintenance man, and John Michael Higgins as the snooty zoo inspector who knowingly holds their future in his smarmy hand.As always, Crowe uses music better than most any other director. This includes his use of score and soundtrack to compliment a scene or drive the setting and mood. What really makes this film work is Matt Damon. His character is the heart of the film and the soul of the family. His performance is strong enough to prevent the film from lapsing into pure sap and makes us care for him, his family and this zoo. Don't expect some cutting edge, independent sulk fest. Just accept the movie for what it is ... a feel good story delivered for the holidays.",We Bought a Zoo
13,anaconda-40658,We Bought a Headache.,5,5 February 2016,"We Bought a Zoo (2011): Dir: Cameron Crowe / Cast: Matt Damon, Scarlett Johansson, Thomas Hayden Church, Colin Ford, Elle Fanning: A lacklustre drama about responsibility. Matt Damon plays Benjamin Mee, a widow whose son is rebellious and just expelled from school. Seeking to start over and shacks up his son and daughter in a new house but the catch, they learn, is that it is a zoo. Great concept with lots of thrilling wildlife including lions, tigers, bears, zebras, peacocks, etc. Unfortunately the film grows formula and too corny for its own good. It needed taken out with a tranquilizer dart right about the time the dimwitted romantic subplot surfaced with Scarlett Johansson making claims that no woman would ever make. Cameron Crowe struck gold before with Almost Famous and the underrated Elizabethtown, but here the wildlife can only distract lame writing and corny situations. Damon holds strong as he struggles to raise his children as well as take on this new task and have the zoo opened at a particular date. Johansson as the head zoo keeper is more or less there to shovel sh*t and shovel more of it at viewers when idiotic romantic elements creep in. Thomas Hayden Church plays Damon's brother in a cardboard role. Colin Ford has the thankless task of playing the whiny son who complains constantly and irritates everyone on screen and off. Elle Fanning makes a cameo appearance that is also second fiddle to the scene stealing wildlife. Great theme regarding responsibility and preserving wildlife but the only thing viewers bought is a headache. Score: 5 ½ / 10",We Bought a Zoo
14,gradyharp,"'Just 20 seconds of insane courage, just embarrassing bravery...'",9,4 April 2012,"Maybe you have to be in the mood or have had a similar life experience or have just been around too many uses of the word 'whatever' that spill out all over the place in an attempt to cover up real feelings, but WE BOUGHT A ZOO is touching. Yes it gets a bit sappy at times, but so doe life. But in the end if you let yourself go with the flow of this true story based on Benjamin Mee's memoir you will end up feeling the pleasure of hugs again. Aline Brosh McKenna joined director Cameron Crowe in adapting the book as a screenplay and it works.Benjamin Mee (Matt Damon) has recently lost his wife to cancer. Always a lover of adventure as in the journalistic form, he sees the newspaper world crumbling and his life of grieving overbearing and in a bid to start his life over, and against the advice of his older brother Duncan (Thomas Haden Church) he follows a new realtor (J.B. Smoove) with his young daughter Rosie (an absolutely captivating Maggie Elizabeth Jones) and purchases a large house that has a zoo. Benjamin and Rosie are delighted, but his young frustrated and failing student son Dylan (Colin Ford) is not happy about it. The zoo is need of renovation and Benjamin sets about the work with the head keeper, Kelly (Scarlett Johansson), and the rest of the zoo staff - MacCready (Angus MacFadyen), Robin (Patrick Fugit), Lily (Elle Fanning). But, the zoo soon runs into financial trouble. The staff must get the zoo back to it's former glory, pass a zoo inspection, and get it back open to the public.In addition to the challenges of the new adventure of owning a zoo, Benjamin must face the reality that his deceased wife is to remain only a sweet memory, must deal with Dylan's anti- social behavior and budding awakening to girls in Lily, must deal with the nauseating inspector Walter Ferris (John Michael Higgins), and gradually become at one with his zoo animals and that responsibility as well as his attraction to Kelly who gives him advice on how to relate to his sullen son Dylan (""The secret to talking is listening'). How it all works out is expected but endearing.This is a strong cast, well directed, and continues Cameron Crowe's tendency to pluck at the heartstrings. Now is that so bad? Don't think so.

15,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: We Bought a Zoo,8,22 December 2011,"6 years. It's been that long since Cameron Crowe last did a feature film in Elizabethtown, before taking that long a hiatus and coming back with a bang this year through his documentary Pearl Jam 20 that chronicled the life and times of the Seattle based alternative rock band, and We Bought a Zoo, a family drama filled with all the good themes necessary for a year end celebration. If you're as big a fan as I am, there's always this feel good factor in his films, together with that whimsical feel and that inevitable touch of romance.You can't help but to feel just how cathartic this film could have been for Crowe himself, who had during this time split from wife and frequent music film collaborator Nancy Wilson, and short of sounding like a cheap tabloid, you can feel every bit of his emotion and state of mind even as we follow single dad Benjamin Mee (Matt Damon), whose wife Katherine (Stephanie Szostak) had already passed away, and now at the crossroads of his life where every turn is a hard decision, especially tasked with raising his kids, moody teenager Dylan (Colin Ford) and the very much younger daughter Rosie (Maggie Elizabeth Jones). Priding himself to be an adventurer of sorts thanks to his journalistic days at being gung ho and a risk taker to get the story he wants, Benjamin now faces the adventure of his life when an almost impulse decision to buy a zoo for its compound and house to live in, led to an expansion of his family to include zookeeping staff, animal handlers and the animals themselves, thanks to his injection of fresh funds to keep the zoo alive for just a little wild longer. No you can't turn into an instant zookeeping expect after viewing this film, as the narrative constantly reminds us how primal some predatory animals can be, the routine experienced by the keepers themselves and essentially a character and relationship exploration between friends, would be lovers whether amongst adults or young ones, and that between family members. Between Benjamin and daughter Rosie, Maggie Elizabeth Jones will definitely steal your heart as the adorable young one whose innocence and sprightly nature boosted the first half of the show thanks to her antics and unbelievable ease and naturalness in front of the camera, while the focus between father and son Dylan had the spotlight to resolve in the latter half, with Colin Ford convincing enough for any parent to want to give him a piece of their mind.After a glamorous three film outing as the spy Jason Bourne and not so glamorous ones with characters like in The Informant, Matt Damon puts on a little weight to star as the everyday fatherly figure who at times have absolutely no clue how to connect with his children, while having the zoo face pressures in getting the bills paid on time. He does enough here to show that he can tackle dramatic roles with aplomb, while Thomas Haden Church supports the role as Benjamin's accountant brother and realist Duncan. Scarlett Johansson tries hard to deglamorize her sensuousness as the head zookeeper Kelly Foster who slowly develops a liking for Benjamin in part due to his determination in not abandoning the zoo's revival project midway, with the story throwing in a little trivial argument over whether to see off aged old animals humanely, with that theme and plot element of death weighing heavily in Benjamin's inability to let go and coming to terms with his wife's death.Then there's Elle Fanning starring as Lily Miska, who hangs out in the zoo and is involved in the romantic subplot with Dylan Mee, a puppy love if you'd like that that on one hand didn't quite work out its kinks despite the potential of a clash of system values between small town girl and big city boy, but on the other showcases enough of her ability to step out of her famous sister's shadow and stand on her own ground, especially after a fabulous run in Super 8. If anything, We Bought a Zoo makes you sit up and want to take notice on how Fanning's, Colin Ford's and Maggie Elizabeth Jones' career will continue from this point, having allowed each to shine in their respective roles here.Like all Cameron Crowe films, the strength lies in the characters, and We Own a Zoo is no slouch in that department, even if the pacing of the narrative may seem to puzzle at certain points, and a blip in characterization most noticeable midway where a serious tiff had Benjamin abandoning his children and left to their devices for dinner, which I felt was a major departure from character, even if one may counter argue he knows that Kelly would be around to see to it that the children are well taken care of after all. And while Crowe's films at times may seem to sprawl, it always has its moments in the film that will talk and engage you directly with its nuggets of wisdom. There's no shortage of such moments here that will touch, and will also on the flip side inadvertently seem to bear his the director's own heart and emotions. There's a single takeaway that I thoroughly love involving 20 seconds of courage, and that awesome, tear inducing finale scene that brings everything full circle with that coming of terms, that's absolutely brilliant in treatment and full of heart. That scene alone is more than worth the price of an admission ticket, I kid you not. Coming from a Cameron Crowe fan this film is naturally recommended.",We Bought a Zoo

17,StevePulaski,We needed one good zoo movie of the year,8,8 April 2012,"It's a shame that We Bought a Zoo got stuck with such a trite, gimmicky title because it's actually a surprising piece of work from a director whose career has been devoted to making dramas with heartwarming characters, we later feel for and grow fond of. Cameron Crowe's simple, yet incredibly well done drama Say Anything... is one of the few non-John Hughes films to be awarded ""The Brat Pack"" stamp, and his drama Almost Famous has garnered a worthy following of the years.Crowe's ambitious style of filmmaking has lead him to pursue family-friendly fare, with We Bought a Zoo, which illustrates the story of Benjamin Mee, played by a superb Matt Damon, a widower who is struggling to keep control of his two children. In need of a change of scenery for him and his kids, Benjamin moves into a beautiful house, with a healthy eighteen acres of land. The catch? ""It's a zoo"" the charismatic and instantly likable real estate agent J.B. Smoove states. Benjamin makes the decision on a whim to buy and fix up the zoo, despite inevitable financial setbacks and the desolate location of the house. He gets loads of help from the cute zookeeper Kelly (Johansson), her colorful band of helpers, and his undeniably adorable seven year old daughter Rosie (Jones). His other son, Dylan (Ford), is a darkly artistic kid, who was recently expelled from school for thievery. While the zoo is busy being re-opened, Dylan instantly becomes drawn to Lily (Fanning), the home-schooled cousin of Kelly.It may come as a surprise to many that the zoo animals are put in the foreground, while the humans enjoy the limelight. We Bought a Zoo is being marketed as a ""human-animal"" comedy, when it should be dubbed a ""family drama."" It involves some heavy subject matter, but always keeps a nice sort of simplicity to its writing and directing.Unfortunately, one quirky and somewhat off-putting message plagues the film from greatness. It gives the shallow and nonsensical idea that one doesn't need to occupy experience, knowledge, or even plans of how you will go about achieving a successful business, but as long as you enough optimism, heart, and are confident in your impulsive decision, stuff will go your way. One could tell Crowe was trying all he could to avoid that idea from elbowing its way into the picture, but it inevitably shows up and is sort of a glaring sore on a picture so vibrant and ambitious.Jonsi's score also deserves a mention. At times, it seems a bit heavy-handed and pushy, but at other times, it seems fitting, necessary, and charming. It always seems to come at the right time, and never over/understay its welcome.I've seen some people even have written the film off as ""emotional manipulation."" Let's refer back to that oh-so-disappointment of a drama Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close. That was emotional manipulation. Every possible depressing element was used as a cloying and aggravating tear-jerking method that made the film feel like it was reaching out to use, forcefully sucking tears out of you. It was embarrassing, pretentious, and desperate. We Bought a Zoo has a much more controlled sense of progression and storytelling. Rather than making us feel sorry for the characters because it's the right thing to do, we actually get to know them over the course of this somewhat lengthy two hours. They are likable people, who don't feel like they are purposefully trying to bother and annoy us.There's one incredibly charming scene at the very end, that involves Benjamin showing Dylan and Rosie where he met their mother and how twenty seconds of insane courage and embarrassing bravery will most of the time result in something good. This is the part of me that loves We Bought a Zoo and Cameron Crowe even more than I already did. It has the ability to take gooey setups, make them aesthetically presentable and not evoke corniness in an act of emotional desperation.We Bought a Zoo is a bit heavier than a lot of other children's films I've seen, and it's definitely one of the smarter. The characters are more vibrant, the messages are presented in a stronger manner, and the story has purpose and, though a tad far-fetched (despite being based off a true story), packs in enough optimism to the point where it isn't oppressive or utterly eerie. I'll leave off by saying, next time you're in the video store with the little-ones, thoroughly read the back covers of both Judy Moody and the NOT Bummer Summer and We Bought a Zoo, and see which one may be healthier for your growing child.Starring: Matt Damon, Scarlett Johansson, Thomas Haden Church, Patrick Fugit, Colin Ford, Elle Fanning, Angus Macfadyen, and Peter Riegert. Directed by: Cameron Crowe.",We Bought a Zoo
18,lasttimeisaw,We Bought a Zoo,5,25 May 2012,"Saw this one in the cinema, after a 6-year hiatus, Cameron Crowe eventually has returned to his director chair (documentaries excluded), but this a cliché ridden family dramedy clearly isn't on a par with his prestige works like ALMOST FAMOUS (2000) or JERRY MAGUIRE (1996), despite being interimittently sparked by a bunch of decent animal cameos. As oversimplified as most Hollywood production, the film never dare to touch a more fly-on- the-wall level of bona fides, one might take it for granted of the situation like that it is so common for an American single dad with two children to buy a zoo and swiftly tackles with the reconstruction of their home with such great ease and casualness (not to mention the film is based on a true story).The film is generally pleasant but discharges a phony posing all over the places, substantially reaches its summit when a tempestuous row between the bereaved father and son (it seems a weight-gaining Matt Damon hasn't done such strenuous work for ages), to give vent to all the suppressed displeasure accumulated, which is a banal gimmick only viable in the dramatized contrivance.Scarlett Johanssan is clearly under the way of re-washing herself in her unassuming and more down-to-earth role (unexpectedly convincing in it, thanks to the lame kiss between her and Damon, another lame Hollywood trickery) after almost a decade from her breakthrough young leading lady status of GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRING (2003) and LOST IN TRANSLATION (2003) and ironically she is still pining for her Oscar-nomination wannabe's entrance, which is quite gloomy for now (the upcoming THE AVENGERS surely cannot be considered seriously). Cameron Crowe's previous flops have left him be shut out in the elite group of Hollywood bankable directors. (typically ALMOST FAMOUS is an unmountable barrier erecting mercilessly in front of him). This family-oriented project cannot act as his last straw, maybe he still has another shot, but the lukewarm credibility can mar his future path quite certainly.",We Bought a Zoo
19,sddavis63,Some Good Performances In A Movie With More Than A Few Weaknesses,4,22 April 2012,"The most obvious thing to say about this film is that it represents an opportunity for Matt Damon to do an entirely different kind of acting. At this point in his career, he's best known as an action star, and particularly for the ""Bourne"" trilogy. Here he takes on a light, semi- comedic, semi-romantic type of role and to his credit he does rather well with it. I thought he came across as believable as Benjamin Mee, who buys a zoo to start life over again after his wife died and left him with two children. Kudos also to the children. Colin Ford and Maggie Elizabeth Jones did well. Ford had a particularly powerful scene with Damon as father and son confront each other over the move to the zoo, which Dylan (Ford) was opposed to, and Jones avoided the irritating child actor syndrome that affects so many young actors. They both did well.Aside from the performances of those three, though, I didn't think this was an especially powerful movie. On the bright side there are a lot of heartwarming and funny animal scenes (which are, of course, totally expected in a film like this.) I'm thinking of the wandering grizzly scene, or the changing of the lock to the lions area. If you have little ones (for whom this movie may not be entirely appropriate, by the way) they'll enjoy a brief scene of peacock eggs hatching. There's also the requisite heartwrenching animal scene as Benjamin comes to terms with the fact that the zoo's aging tiger will have to be euthanized. So, pretty typical animal stuff involved in that.On the negative side though, there were a number of things that detracted from this. First were an assortment of somewhat ""cartoonish"" characters - characters that just seemed a little off-balance and that made it hard to take the movie as a whole seriously. Mr. Stevens (J.B. Smoove), the real estate agent who sells the zoo to me seemed to fit into that category, as did zoo inspector Walter Ferris (John Michael Higgins). I also was a bit put off by the totally unnecessary quasi- romances built into the story for Mee and his son, with Kelly (Scarlett Johansson) and Lily (Elle Fanning.) They seemed out of place and distracting to the real story, which was getting the zoo ready to pass inspection before it could open.The movie is loosely (very loosely) based on the story of the Dartmoor Zoo in Devon, England, although it's transplanted to California because American audiences apparently wouldn't believe that there were zoos in England. Forgive the sarcasm. Apparently the real Mee family must have approved of the rather significant dramatic licence taken with their story, since they did appear in the movie as one of the families who visit the zoo at the end.It's not a bad movie. It does have those pretty decent performances from those playing the Mee family. It just seems a little bit light on content, and it doesn't really come across as being an especially significant story. (4/10)",We Bought a Zoo
20,Hellmant,The best zoo movie ever made!,8,3 March 2012,"'WE BOUGHT A ZOO': Four Stars (Out of Five) The best zoo movie ever made and writer / director Cameron Crowe's best movie since 'ALMOST FAMOUS' in 2000. It's Crowe's first film since 2005's 'ELIZABETHTOWN' (which was a disappointment for many, including me) and his first family film ever. It's based on the memoir of Benjamin Mee (who moved in to a closed zoo with his family and reopened it). Matt Damon stars as Mee and Scarlett Johansson, Thomas Haden Church, Elle Fanning and Patrick Fugit (William from 'ALMOST FAMOUS') co-star. The screenplay was co-written by Aline Brosh McKenna. All in all it's definitely an inspiring and heart warming film (like all of Crowe's work).When we meet Benjamin Mee he's a recently widowed father of two. After his son Dylan (Colin Ford) gets in trouble at school Benjamin decides to relocate his family. After looking at several homes he and his daughter, Rosie (Maggie Elizabeth Jones), really fall in love with one. They then learn it's the home of a closed zoo (somehow they didn't realize this walking up to it) and whoever moves in to the house takes on the responsibility of reopening the endangered zoo. The Mee family bonds with the employees there and really starts to re-bond with each other as well despite the emotional and financial struggles of trying to reopen a zoo. Benjamin especially bonds with employee Kelly Foster (Johansson) and Dylan especially bonds with employee Lilly Miska (Fanning). Together they all try to work through their hardships.The movie is a little cheesy and corny at times but that's to be expected from a movie geared towards the entire family. Crowe once again puts his magical touch on the film and really produces a heartfelt movie. Damon and the rest of the cast are all more than adequate and the soundtrack is superb (like with all of Crowe's films). If you're a fan of Crowe you're almost sure to enjoy.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDQQKEqGhZQ",We Bought a Zoo
21,MLDinTN,needed more of a thrill,5,5 November 2012,"This movie is a family drama; the problem with it is that it needed something dramatic/thrilling to happen. Benjamin and his two kids buy a house that comes with a zoo. His son, Dylan, is going through growing pains since the mom died and he is just moody all the time. The daughter, Rosie, is cute and the best part of the film. The zoo also comes with some employees and they all work to get the zoo fixed and ready to open in July. I would have liked it with more animal interaction, but this film is about the people. Too bad it wasn't better written.FINAL VERDICT: A fair family film, but I wouldn't recommend it.",We Bought a Zoo
22,g-bodyl,Family Fun!,9,10 June 2013,"We Bought a Zoo is a fun family film that the whole family can enjoy. While the tone is mostly light-hearted, there is more darker family drama than I expected. There is really no profanity at all except for maybe one scene where the daughter of the family has a nice name for the zoo inspector. This film has great acting, a good script, and is directed by Cameron Crowe. I think this may be Crowe's best movie since Jerry Maguire.Based off a true story, this film is about how a family suffering from a loss of someone very close to them move from the city to the countryside where they buy a zoo. Now they have a goal to tidy up the zoo and get it open for the public.This movie is well-acted. Matt Damon puts up a strong performance as Benjamin Mee and I loved how he shown different shades of emotions as he struggles to raise his kids alone, how he can properly manage a zoo, and how he misses someone dearly close to him. Scarlett Johansson is really pretty and does well as the head zoo trainer. The small role by John Michael Higgins adds some good comedy as the inspector. I'm also pleased to note that the kids were not annoying.Overall, this is a well-acted drama that delves into family themes and how doing hard work will bring them together as a family. The animals are really cool and I'm glad that they have many scenes especially the tigers. This is a much better film than I anticipated and it's good for the entire family to enjoy. I know I did. I rate this film 9/10.",We Bought a Zoo

24,lesleyharris30,"Formulaic and Tedious,",5,10 June 2015,"We Bought a Zoo is a very mediocre movie with a reasonably well developed storyline and a cast that, for the most part, seem very uninspired. It has some aspects of quality, obviously any scenes with animals in it will bring a smile to your face, for a movie about a zoo there aren't really enough of these, and Matt Damon puts all his heart in to his performance, he's a very convincing father and he certainly carries the whole film. The plot is very formulaic which is certainly the biggest problem, it's very predictable and too straight forward, it also tries too hard to be sweet and heartwarming, this is obviously something that should always feature in a movie, but when they're trying to do it every few minutes it becomes very tedious. Besides Damon, the rest of the cast seemed very uninspired, his kids clearly didn't take much acting classes before this movie, and Scarlett Johansson seemed to have no interest in this script whatsoever, she was phoning it in. Though there are some good scenes, We Bought a Zoo is mostly a very boring and predictable film that I would not recommend. A father moves his family to the countryside, where they end up buying a dilapidated zoo. Best Performance: Matt Damon Worst Performance: Elle Fanning",We Bought a Zoo
25,secondtake,"Warm, uncomplicated, alternating between true emotion and pushy sentiment",7,23 June 2012,"We Bought a Zoo (2011)A linear, broken-family, feel good, nicely made story--which so far also describes the recent George Clooney movie ""The Descendants""--about a zoo. That's the hook here, the zoo and the animals on both sides of the fence at what is really a unique small rural animal park in California.When everyone acts with such charm and realism and the cast is filled with quirky lovable characters, you can't go wrong. And Cameron Crowe is of course an expert movie-maker, more admired for his writing than his directing but a mainstream success in both worlds--and he is both here, with co-writer Aline McKenna. Matt Damon is most convincing and unaffected I've ever seen him--he tends to have roles that have slightly off-kilter personas, as in ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" or all the Bourne movies, where he is more machine than man. Here he is the warm, understanding, only slightly flawed father of two, and a recent widower. The other large force here, and I say that tenderly, is Scarlett Johansson, who is the most unaffected I've ever seen her--thinking now of ""The Girl with the Pearl Earring"" and scintillating roles in Woody Allen movies. If Damon is spot on and steady, Johansson outdoes him in her more sporadic screen-time, and she's beautifully astonishing at being an ordinary girl, which she probably is not anymore than Damon is an ordinary guy.I'm delaying the down side because the movie is so warm and well-intended. But boy does it barrel into straight up sentimental manipulation, even at one point becoming a kind of several minute cinematic detour as the dad sits and dreams of his former life before losing his wife. It's meant to be beautiful and emotional, and you might cry against your better wishes, but it's so unnecessary and in a way beside the point.But that depends what you want from the movie. Certainly the hook and line and sinker in the promos is that this bereft family buys a broken down zoo and the adventure begins, and this (with all the animal roles) is where I bought in myself. But a full half of the movie is how the family deals (as in ""The Descendants"") with losing Mom. And of course mom, by now in their memories, is a perfect and too-beautiful paradigm that must sometimes be true but again is unnecessarily idealized. This is the soft, tear-drenched wedge in an otherwise terrific straight up true-life story. Would I recommend this? Absolutely, for the acting and the zoo story line, but without expecting a masterpiece.For a brief explanation of the actual zoo and family this is based on see the Wiki entry--mainly to note that the real zoo was and is in England, and that the real Mr. Mee bought it with his wife and she died after they had moved in.

Its a struggle, as everyone is still grieving the loss of their family member and learning to adjust. Teenage Dylan, especially, is troubled, as he draws creepy pictures and acts out in school. All too soon, he is expelled. Therefore, Benjamin decides, over the objections of his accountant brother, Duncan (Thomas Haden Church) to buy a home on the very outskirts of the Los Angeles area. Rosie loves the house at first site and so does Benjamin. The trouble is, however, that the large property is very unique. It has a small zoo on the premises! Woweee. Yes, there's lions and tigers and one big Grizzly bear, among other animals. The small staff includes head zookeeper Kelly (Scarlett Johanssen) and her teen niece, Lily (Elle Fanning). Since Benjamin knows nothing about operating a zoo, there is much to learn and many bills to pay. Also, although Rosie is happily residing in the new digs, Dylan is grouchier than ever, for none of his friends bother to come and visit him and he doesn't seem to want to begin a new friendship with Lily. As money problems, animal health problems, staff problems, and kid problems pile up one by one, will Benjamin rue the day ""We Bought a Zoo""? This is a lovely film for fans who don't need explosions or car chases to entertain them. Its a sweet, funny story, based on fact, and its beautifully shot. In addition, the cast is great, playing very genuine and flawed characters. Damon does a nice dad while Johanssen drops a bit of glam to play an outdoorsy type, with nice results. Church, especially, steals scenes easily while the child actors steal hearts just as smoothly.

There is both humor that is polite and light instead of over the top dumb which could have easily overwhelmed an animal movie like this. There is also several deeper dark and intense dramatic moments both at the beginning that is lightly but effectively touched on and later between father and son. There aren't any really manipulative story points, but a rather captivating tone of events that proceed to its conclusion which has a memorable touch about death and life. It's hard to know how much to cut or add in such a movie that it is easy to point out the absence of much character development of the supporting cast including both human and animal kind. There is also the omission of the inclusion of more the laptop photo slides at the beginning of the movie that would become a key part later in the movie.

The main problem with the film is that it isn't as interesting or unique given that it's about a zoo. Nothing much out the of ordinary happens and at times it is quite dull.The movie is also very predictable but dealing with a novel, it appears to be expected. As we know everything will work out in the end, we know the zoo will be back running in good shape, people will enjoy it, the father-son relationship will better itself and eventually Matt Damon and Scarlett Johansson's characters fall for each other. It is also quite unrealistic as he seemed like he was able to smoothly pay for everything that appeared to be a problem with the zoo. The film didn't mention how Matt Damon had all that money, but living in a zoo, the price would be very expensive, and the film made it seem like a fantasy. They did show some scenes of problems but overall everything seemed a little far fetched and unrealistic.

The trouble with the story is not so much what the man does, and how its impacts on his family, but that it is purportedly based on a true story, the facts of which bear no resemblance to the plot. The actual story took place in England and the writer's wife was alive at the time, and not deceased as depicted in the movie. Now this doesn't mean that the movie's story lacks credibility, but what it does mean is that the story is to a large extent a work of fiction and should be treated as such. Matt Damon is excellent as the writer and Scarlet Johannsen is charming as an animal trainer who helps the writer manage the animals. One positive feature of this movie are the animals, especially the grizzly bear and the tiger, which are all magnificent creatures. The idea that these animals were at risk of being destroyed is outrageous and the fact that somebody came forward to save them is noteworthy, but let's give credit where credit is due, and in this case credit belongs to an Englishman.",We Bought a Zoo

39,estebangonzalez10,Cameron Crowe delivers once again!,9,30 January 2012,"¨You know, sometimes all you need is twenty seconds of insane courage. Just literally twenty seconds of just embarrassing bravery. And I promise you, something great will come of it.¨ 2011 brought us some surprisingly great family films such as The Muppets and Dolphin Tale, but I think Cameron Crowe just won me over for the best one of the year with We Bought a Zoo. I'm a huge Crowe fan and have loved most of his films (I even loved Elizabethtown and am not ashamed of admitting it despite being hated by nearly every critic), especially Almost Famous and Jerry Maguire. I think this film is up to par with his best work despite being over sentimental at times. I think that what I like best about Crowe's films are his dialogues. I think he's a good writer and he creates some interesting characters. He usually writes his own stories for his films, although this time he based it on a true story and adapted the screenplay from Benjamin Mee's biography, but he still should receive credit for his adaptation. The story isn't the only thing that works, a lot of credit has to be given to Matt Damon for his performance in the lead role and to the rest of the supporting cast. Scarlett Johansson had strong chemistry with Damon and her performance felt believable, Maggie Elizabeth Jones was cuter than any other character on screen this year, Elle Fanning is almost as amazing as she was in Super 8 (she's turning into my favorite young actress along with Chloe Grace Moretz), while Thomas Haden Church, John Higgins, and Angus Macfadyen provided most of the laughs in the movie. Colin Ford had to play kind of the rebellious teen son and he did a decent job although he perhaps had the least interesting character. The animals also play a huge part in the overall effectiveness of the film.The film is based on a true story about a father named Benjamin Mee (Matt Damon) who after losing his wife has to raise his two children on his own in Southern California. His fourteen year old son, Dylan (Colin Ford, a young Bon Jovi lookalike) is going through a very dark time and is having trouble at school. He ends up being expelled for stealing some money and for painting a very dark mural. His seven year old daughter, Rosie (Maggie Elizabeth Jones) is a lot closer to her father and is cuter than any other girl her age. She is sweet and always smiling, a complete contrast to Dylan. Benjamin becomes tired of the city life and quits his job as a journalist and decides to buy a new home in the countryside. This new home is big, has lots of space, but it comes with one special responsibility: it is a zoo. Benjamin decides it's time to begin a new adventure and decides to repair the zoo in time to open it for the public in the summer. The zoo is pretty much abandoned, but with the help of a few workers left Benjamin begins putting his life savings into it in order to restore it in time before the next inspection. Kelly Foster (Scarlett Johansson) has worked at the zoo for several years and becomes his right hand helper, along with Peter (Angus Macfadyen), Robin (Patrick Fugit), and her thirteen year old niece Lily (Elle Fanning). Benjamin's accountant brother Duncan (Thomas Haden Church) warns him about the financial risks involved, but he decides to go with his heart and live a new adventure.If you've seen a Cameron Crowe film before then you know this won't just be a family film. Crowe loves music and he always includes some really great soundtracks in his stories. He also manages to include one or two dialogues based on music. He makes a reference to Dylan being named after the great Bob Dylan, but later we realize he was really named Dylan for his dog. Just like the Crowe humor isn't missing here, the romantic stories aren't left out either. Crowe is a romantic at heart. We've seen some of the most famous romantic lines in movies like Jerry Maguire, such as ¨you had me at hello,¨ but here he also includes a few lines that will be memorable like the ¨twenty seconds of insane courage¨ one. The film is really worth a watch, it is for everyone, it has a love story, several funny scenes, an inspiring story, and several cute animals. Adults and children will enjoy this film alike. I was surprised to hear the characters in which this film was based actually had a cameo near the end of the movie. The real Benjamin and his two children were the first in line to climb the fallen tree in order to reach the zoo. Matt Damon is such a reliable actor; he has had a great year, but the true heart of the film here relies on the cuteness of Elle Fanning, Maggie Elizabeth Jones, and the animals. Yes this film might be over sentimental and cheesy at times, but it's so cute that it's hard to resist.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com",We Bought a Zoo

The new house they buy comes along with a zoo, and they get a tour of it from the ""owners."" I loved the animals in it, and my favorite scenes in it include the inspection and when the bear escapes.

41,juneebuggy,Actually surprised that with this cast & director how mediocre this movie is,5,18 October 2014,"I expected this to be way better than it was. Actually I was kinda surprised that with this cast and director attached how...well, not bad exactly, but mediocre it ended up being.This was also a little vague and choppy at times, silly even (evil zoo inspector) and the daughter was just way too precocious. I also could have done without the overbearing score of music, telling me how to feel -cue tearjerker moment. And even though this is based on an autobiography it still felt clichéd, like you've seen this family drama play out before. The zoo being the only original aspect. It is a nice family movie though, all about healing and moving on and exotic animals and Matt and Scarlett do a good enough job.I think this might have played out better if they'd kept it in England, as it was written. By moving it to America all the eccentric secondary characters fell flat and it made little sense that there was a functioning pub on his land especially when he lived 9 miles from anyone and the zoo was still closed. These aspects made just me want to read the book. 4/23/14",We Bought a Zoo
42,bob-rutzel-1,A Warm Family Movie? Almost.,6,6 April 2012,"This is based upon a true story. Benjamin Mee (Matt Damon) lost his wife 6-months ago, has a troubled son and cannot get over his wife's death. He quits his job as a writer doing adventurous things just so he can write about them (guess he didn't know about being a reviewer of adventure-type movies). Now, he feels he must make changes because everything reminds him of his late wife. Hence, he buys a Zoo. That should do it, don't you think?I am at odds with this movie. I was of the belief this would be a very warm family type movie and, in some ways, it was. Those ""some"" ways included 7-year old Rosie (Maggie Jones) and her comments with Benjamin that seemed she was wise beyond her years and Benjamin's flashbacks to memories of his wife playing with the children. However, other than those family type scenes, this concentrated more on son Dylan's (Colin Ford) strained relationship with Benjamin and getting the Zoo ready for opening day. This also tried hard to get Benjamin to move forward after his wife's death.I expected to see more interaction with the animals in a nice fun way. ( No, not the snakes. Ugh!) Didn't happen. Hey, this is not a Disney movie like back in the day. Most of what we see is business as ""unusual"" with everyone busy, busy, busy trying to get the Zoo ready after a 2-year layoff. The director must have been on time constraints as many scenes seemed like they were done with the players on roller skates. While the pacing may have been too fast all the cast performed well. And, even though we know Matt Damon as an action hero from the Jason Bourne movies, he is quite polished as a dramatic actor. His scenes with everyone were spot on and there was good chemistry with Scarlett Johansson. The entire cast performed well. The loud, angry confrontation between Benjamin and Dylan was largely uncomfortable to watch and listen to. We were hoping for a Dylan epiphany later on. Language: there is some but mostly soft stuff, the S-word and BS words. However, little 7-yr old Rosie calls the Zoo Inspector (John Michael Higgins) a part of the male anatomy: a "" D**k."" Nice warm family movie? I think not, but almost. Comic relief. Rosie when she wasn't calling the Zoo Inspector a name; and later on Benjamin's brother Duncan (Thomas Haden Church) but his dialogues were largely ineffective and not funny. The statement at the end of the movie says the kids, Dylan and Rosie are still living on the property, but there is no mention of Benjamin, Kelly and Lily (Elle Fanning) a love interest of Dylan. So much for being a true story, and oh yes, a warm family movie as well. (6/10)Violence: No. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language Soft Stuff. Children under 5-yrs: Not recommended. There are some scary parts with the animals and snakes. Hey, I jumped at times. Maybe under 8-yrs, 9-yrs you decide.",We Bought a Zoo
43,moviexclusive,"A lot of heart and humanity makes this a delightful, inspiring and poignant autobiographical tale notable too for a peerless lead act by Matt Damon",8,20 December 2011,"You can't get more obvious what your film is about with a title like 'We Bought a Zoo', but fortunately director Cameron Crowe's adaptation of British journalist Benjamin Mee's autobiography possesses much more subtlety and nuance than what its title would suggest. The story of a grieving widower who makes the unusual decision to buy a rural property whose 18 acres includes the Rosemoor Animal Park, it is also Crowe's first feature since his 2005 flop 'Elizabethtown' and the feel-good family movie represents a welcome return to form for the talented filmmaker behind such classics like 'Say Anything' and 'Jerry Maguire'.Working off a script by 'The Devil Wears Prada' and 'Morning Glory's' Aline Brosh McKenna, Crowe grounds the high-concept tale in a heart- warming story about a lonely widower trying to overcome his grief for his bereaved wife while attempting to reconnect with his teenage son Dylan (Colin Ford) and young daughter Rosie (Maggie Elizabeth Jones). Crowe is better than to take the easy route of mawkish sentimentality; instead, there is genuine humanity and optimism in his storytelling, complemented by some outstanding performances that he coaxes from an ensemble cast- in particular his lead actor Matt Damon.Though the 'Bourne' trilogy has cemented his reputation as a thinking man's action star, Damon has been and still is a strong dramatic actor. The astute actor confidently matches the emotional beats that Crowe chooses for his character every step of the way, from sanguineness at a change of scenery early on to dismay later on when one thing after another goes awry. His is a heartfelt performance that packs a powerful emotional wallop in his understated delivery of a father struggling to do it right by his children- and nowhere is this more evident than in a powerful scene where Benjamin and Dylan address their fractured relationship head-on which is guaranteed to bring tears to your eyes.The conviction that Damon brings to his role is a huge reason why the film achieves its intended poignancy. A scene where his character finally overcomes his fear of looking at past photographs of his wife and their happy days together as a family is simple yet moving- and appropriately filmed in close-ups; while the film's last scene where he reminisces his first encounter with his deceased wife to his children also works brilliantly thanks to Damon at his earnest best. He also shares great chemistry with each of his co-stars- whether Scarlett Johannson's perceptive zookeeper Kelly, or Thomas Haden Church's wry older brother Duncan.Both Johannson and Church are also individually outstanding in their supporting roles, alongside other equally incomparable veterans like Angus MacFadyen as the groundskeeper with a longstanding grudge for park inspector Walter Ferris (John Michael Higgins) and Patrick Fugit (who played Crowe's alter ego in 'Almost Famous') as one of the zoo staffers with a capuchin monkey perpetually perched on his shoulders. Crowe has also assembled an impressive teenage cast- Ford brings a raw edge to his character's anger, counterbalanced perfectly by the ebullient Elle Fanning as Kelly's cousin- as well as an impossibly adorable Maggie Elizabeth Jones sure to melt your heart.Aided by an outstanding cast, Crowe drives the narrative along with a sure confident hand. Alongside the running themes of grief and parenthood are well-inserted vignettes of Benjamin and his crew's obstacles at getting the zoo up to inspection standards in time for a grand reopening on the seventh seventh (or the seventh of July)- among them the escape of the zoo's 650-pound grizzly bear Buster, the fate of the zoo's 17-year-old ailing tiger Spar and of course Benjamin's impending bankruptcy (that we admit is over all too soon by a dues ex machina). Still, there is genuine feeling in every scene, and Crowe's choice of music (a mix of oldies with more contemporary tunes) as well as Jónsi's (of Icelandic cult band Sigur Rós) eclectic score works perfectly in complementing the mood of the film. And even though it's tinged with sadness, the tone of the film is never depressing- Crowe making it sure that the film steers clear of both over-dramatic as well as melodramatic moments. There's hope and affirmation abound in this inspirational tale, and just because its message of acceptance and reconciliation may sound familiar doesn't mean it is less authentic or touching for that matter. It wears its heart on its sleeve, but thanks to Crowe's deft hand as well as Damon's heartfelt performance, even the cynical will find themselves moved. www.moviexclusive.com",We Bought a Zoo
44,mike48128,A Disney-like Movie from Cameron Crowe?,7,18 April 2016,"That is both a complement and an insult at the same time. So ""wholesome"" and yet so unrealistic. Almost based on a true story. The real zoo was in England and the real-life counterpart really did buy an old, broken-down, condemned zoo. Populated by beautiful people like Elle Fanning and Scarlet Johansson. Reminds me a lot of the MGM Movie & Series ""Clarence-the-Cross-Eyed-Lion"". The house is purchased and the zoo kind of comes with it. A young widower moves here from the city in a desperate effort to keep his family together after mom dies. Many different characters and situations from puppy-love to bankruptcy occur. Actually much better than it sounds! A nice, clean, but almost unbelievable series of events pulls it all together, including the special ""death with dignity"" of a very-old (but not cross-eyed) lion.

For example the evil Zoo examiner, the teen romance and the young girl is pin perfect cute the way she moves and smiles and say those intelligent lines, It went little too much. Besides that the tension between father and his teen son screams Typical. Anyways it isn't a big deal as its pretty entertaining and an enjoyable family movie.

50,napierslogs,"Walks the Hollywood line but is sweet, funny and enjoyable",8,21 April 2012,"""We Bought a Zoo"" is a family movie. And I'm going to make that distinction very clear. A children's movie is family friendly but is enjoyed by children and pretty much only children. A family movie is family friendly and can be enjoyed by anyone and is meant to be enjoyed by everyone. This film is pretty much the only example that comes to mind and that just proves how rare it is.The reason such an oddball, simple story like a family owning a zoo works on more than just a silly level is because Cameron Crowe is a talented filmmaker who knows story structure. The story here is that Benjamin Mee (Matt Damon) has just lost his wife to cancer and is struggling to raise his two children. After problems at school and in their neighbourhood, they look for a new adventure. His seven year-old daughter loves it (of course!) and her many excited exclamations provide the movie's title. It's also based on a true story.The comedy is of a sweet nature rather than animal silliness (as one might expect) or screwball annoyances. It gets dramatic as we examine the father-son relationship and with the life-changing decisions that come after you buy a zoo. I really was on the edge of my seat hoping the zoo would be a success. Normally one wouldn't question that, but Crowe has the ability to write smart movies. Here, however, he has a less talented co-screenwriter and the story never did go as far or reach the inventive heights as I had hoped. It was still good but it walked the line that Hollywood has drawn.One of my reasons for watching this was Thomas Haden Church, but I have no idea why they insisted on giving him the worst, cloying lines with nothing else of value. At least John Michael Higgins is consistently funny in supporting roles. Despite the attractiveness and star power of Damon and Scarlett Johansson, young Maggie Elizabeth Jones was the highlight. Her uninhibited joy and pure need for innocence is what made this so enjoyable.",We Bought a Zoo

53,Bob-45,"Charming, but uneasy walk between ""family film"" and drama",7,6 May 2012,"I could give ""We bought a Zoo"" my ""7"" rating based just on the performances of actresses Scarlett Johansson, Maggie Elizabeth Jones and Elle Fanning. Until know, I've found the voluptuous Jahansson surprisingly resistible. However, here adorned with unattractive clothing concealing her more notable features, Johannson resorts to facial expressions and real acting to win appeal and it works. Maggie Elizabeth Jones delivers the most memorable performance by a seven year old girl since Drew Barrymore gave us ""Gertie"" in ""E.T."". Director Cameron Crowe must have recognized this, given the ""E.T."" homage, when he has Jones buried among the stuffed animals. Finally, Elle Fanning's ethereal beauty of both body and spirit is the first to match Elizabeth Taylor's ""Velvet Brown"" in nearly 70 years.Given all this, ""We Bought a Zoo"" walks a tightrope of drama, farce and cloying family fare and frequently does so unsteadily. I could imagine small children squirming at the length and pacing, parents cringing at the profanity and graphic art by the emotionally disturbed son and virtually everyone touched, but puzzled by the ending; which, while the movie's most touching scene, seems somehow out of place, even though it makes a valid point within the context of the film's theme. Given these problems, I cannot give ""We Bought a Zoo"" either an unqualified recommendation or a higher rating than a strong ""7,"" but that certainly is enough.",We Bought a Zoo
54,jon.h.ochiai,20 Seconds of Insane Courage,9,29 December 2011,"Sitting on the barn floor with his 14 year-old son Dylan (angst plagued Colin Ford), who fears taking a chance on a pretty girl Lily (sweet hearted Elle Fanning), Benjamin Mee (resolute Matt Damon) implores, ""Sometimes all you need is 20 seconds of insane courage And I promise you, something great will come of it."" Director and Writer Cameron Crowe's ""We Bought a Zoo"" is about the courage to take a risk and follow your heart. Matt Damon is powerful and sublime. Crowe wrote the funny and poignant screenplay with Aline Brosh McKenna (""The Devil Wears Prada"") based on the book by Benjamin Mee. Yes, this is based on the true story of the Mee family, who bought a home with a zoo in Southern California. ""We Bought a Zoo"" is wonderful surprise. I was touched by its humanity, the authenticity of loss, and the celebration of life. Colin Ford is amazing as the dour teen Dylan, who transforms-- creating new beginnings and his life.Crowe is poetic in catharsis. Lily asks her cousin zoologist Kelly (brightly intense Scarlett Johansson), ""If you were to choose: animals or people?"" The socially clumsy Kelly answers with a beaming smile. Crowe and McKenna's metaphor is about the people we love. Matt Damon is understatedly bold as widower Benjamin, who veers orthogonally in life in an attempt to forget the loss of the great love of his life, Katherine (beautiful Stephanie Szostak), only to be reminded of her in everything-- including the fate of an ailing tiger. This is not so far-fetched, and endearingly human. Benjamin can't even have lunch with his older accountant brother Duncan (ironically fostering Thomas Haden Church) at any restaurant associated with his memories of Katherine.Damon is Benjamin, a fearless adventure newspaper columnist, at the crossroads of his life. When we first meet him, he is rushing his kids Rosie (precociously cute Maggie Elizabeth Jones) and Dylan (sullen Ford) to school. Mom passed away less than a year ago. Rosie doesn't completely grasp the aftermath. Dylan channels his anger and fear in his macabre Gothic art exemplified in the drawing of propelling bloody decapitated head in a school display, which gets him expelled. Troubled Dylan demonstrates genuine talent, albeit clinically disturbing. Dad prefers Benjamin instead of Ben, which was his Dad's distinction. In an exit scene vaguely reminiscent of Crowe's ""Jerry Maguire"", Benjamin quits his job. Consequently, the Mee's look for a new home. One home resonates with Benjamin, and it houses an entire zoo. Rosie immediately falls in love with it. Jones's face captures the wondrous enchantment of a 6 year-old. Here Damon is amazing as he witnesses the joy of Rosie, and his entire world alters. . Dylan on the other hand thinks this is crazy—not what he wants. Crowe reveals his story with ease, grace and humor.Along with the Zoo, Benjamin inherits the Zoo Staff. Their leader is impatient and unwavering Kelly Foster (Johansson). If Benjamin chooses to proceed, they have to prepare for an inspection by July, by the beyond anal retentive Walter Ferris (comically humorless John Michael Higgins). Inevitably, this will cost Benjamin his family inheritance—something Duncan (Church) vigorously reminds. Honestly, Kelly can't figure whether Benjamin is the naïve savior or the well intentioned fool? I found Johansson refreshingly strong and no nonsense. This is the most transparent I've seen her in a role—it is awesome. Obviously, she is the possible romantic interest, but she keeps us guessing. Similarly, Elle Fanning (Dakota's younger sister) is clearly smitten by brooding Dylan, although he is too self-absorbed to know what's up. She is the young soul full of light and life.Damon is the brilliant nexus of ""We Bought a Zoo"". He embodies powerful gravitas and grace as a man completing the past and boldly expanding into the unknown. There is a heart wrenching scene where he argues with Dylan about the family and Rosie. Benjamin's children remind him of the best in his late wife. And Dylan ironically reminds Benjamin of both the worst and best of himself. Again, this is not a bad thing—simply a human thing. In the eloquent fade away, Damon along with Ford and Jones touchingly remind us that all it takes is 20 seconds of insane courage. Life goes on.",We Bought a Zoo

Benjamin (Matt Damon), a widower with two children buys a broken-down zoo, and must fix it up before he can open it. He struggles with regulations, sickly animals, and escaped snakes. His adolescent son, Dylan, hates him, and spends his time drawing nihilistic pictures. His cute daughter thrives. Kelly (Scarlett Johansson), a zoo keeper, has a crush on him, but he can't get over his deceased wife. His brother, Thomas Haden Church, keeps telling him to listen to his head, not his heart, and to give up on the zoo. There are plenty of cool animals on screen: lions, tigers, and bears. The bear is given the most to do. The zookeepers are themselves pretty exotic and they party and bond. Dylan gets a girlfriend. Otherwise, not much happens. The final scene didn't work for me. Part of the thrust of the movie was Benjamin moving on from his wife's death. But I won't reveal the ending. ""We Bought a Zoo"" is a fun, upbeat movie and a good escape that doesn't offer much to think about. Scarlett Johansson is especially good. She wears standard zookeeper clothing – no décolletage – and she doesn't have any hot scenes. She just, plain, acts – and she's surprisingly good at it.",We Bought a Zoo
57,JohnRayPeterson,"Sweet, endearing, delightful. Impossible to dislike.",7,6 April 2012,"When I read that this movie was based on a book by the same name, and that it is was a true story, I looked it up on Wikipedia (Dartmoor Zoological Park) and found it interesting; I expected that if Matt Damon was on board for the lead, it should be a film worth seeing, not to mention Cameron Crowe back in the director's chair would be a plus. It turns out the movie was indeed very pleasant to watch, well worth the two hours of your 'entertainment time'.The cast has five actors I really like, Matt Damon in the role of Benjamin Mee, Scarlett Johansson in the role of Kelly Foster, Thomas Haden Church in the role of Duncan Mee, Angus Macfadyen in the role of Peter MacCready and Elle Fanning in the role of Lily. I discovered the talent of Collin Ford, who plays the serious parts as Damon's son; the best dramatic moments (realistic life moments) featured these two actors. I was also completely sold on Maggie Elizabeth Jones' performance; she steals the scenes she's in. This seven year old can charm even a cold hearted fogy; if you're a father or grand-dad, you're going to rewind her scenes.The early parts of the movie may lead you to think it will be just an okay comedy; wait because it does get better. The moment the Mees (father and daughter) set their heart on buying the zoo, the story might become predictable but I assure you, it won't matter if it is. The well written script makes it clear that the Mees were looking for a fresh start in their lives. The difficulties the Mees face with salvaging their zoo are matched by the difficulties they struggle (father and son) through to cope with the loss of Benjamin's wife, Dylan's mother. That role, played by Stephanie Szostak, is a timeline edited part. The editing and the musical score are very well done; these go a long way in making the film well liked by those who rated it.Don't let the title of the movie dissuade you from watching it; it's a delightful, heart warming motion picture you're not going to regret watching.",We Bought a Zoo
58,Likes_Ninjas90,For the adults it is more complex than a lot of light family entertainment and I think that's why I enjoyed it so much,7,19 December 2011,"Benjamin (Matt Damon) is a single parent and a writer, looking after his teenage son Dylan (Colin Ford) and his small daughter Rosie (Maggie Elizabeth Jones). Following the death of their mother the kids have not been coping particularly well. Dylan is regularly distracted by his angry drawings and is expelled from school for stealing. Benjamin is urged by his older brother Duncan (Thomas Haden Church), an accountant, to start living his life again. In his desperation to turn the lives of his kids and himself around, Benjamin begins house hunting. He visits a property and immediately holds an attachment to it. What he discovers is that the property is actually a struggling zone. Seeing how attracted Rosie is to the land herself, Benjamin becomes the new owner. With the help of a number of workers, including Kelly (Scarlett Johansson) and her niece Lily (Elle Fanning), Benjamin looks to use his own finances to reopen the zoo. Yet the tension with his son, who has been extremely reluctant about moving, still remains. You would have to be some kind of scrooge to dislike this movie. It is safe, entirely predictable and sugary but then again it's not really for you. It is for the families on Boxing Day too smart to involve themselves with the horses of war. Colour me surprised, and this is really the film's only surprise, but here is a family movie that doesn't rely on obvious humour and idiotic slapstick comedy. It's a true story, transported from the South West of England in real life to America for the film, and anyone who isn't a cynic is welcome to this. For the adults it is more complex than a lot of light family entertainment and I think that's why I enjoyed it so much. This apparent complexity stems from Matt Damon's amusing and soulful performance. This guy has matured so much in the last few years, separating himself from a still-Bourne action star, into an extremely versatile actor. He's playing a genuinely nice character here, who is in equal measure, frustrated and desperate to help his family. This comes through a lot of the humour and gentle- nudging in the film, as he tries and generally fails to blend in, embarrassing himself because he is out of comfort zone. He's genuine funny and brings so much feeling to this character that he somehow makes you understand why he was so impulsive in the first place. Although many of the film's conflicts are resolved too easily, Benjamin's isolation from his wife and his search for renewal is, for the most part, sympathetic and touching. I thought his chemistry with Elizabeth Jones was just about perfect too. Some of the best scenes in the film are with them alone because they have such a warm, inseparable relationship. She's just an adorable little actress, with just the right amount of input. Some child stars overplay their hand. You notice this kid for the right reasons. I particularly enjoyed the inclusion of Duncan too, someone who has been adventurous himself but was left unsatisfied and doesn't want his brother to fall into the same trap. His relationship with Benjamin, which has its share of funny moments too, makes sense. For small children this is a visually warm film, with so many different animals that you can forgive the omission of a petting zone. I think the message of this film is also refreshing. Some of the dialogue is sugar- coated too thickly with lines like, 'The secret to talking is to listen'. Yet the idea of taking a risk, or as the film puts it, 'Twenty- seconds of courage', instead of the usual balderdash about being yourself, feels refreshing and anew. If you're choosing between this and the Chipmunks these holidays just remember which film has a chimp in a zookeeper uniform.",We Bought a Zoo

So he works to renovate the zoo, basically.The rest of the cast includes Scarlett Johansson as the head zoo curator, Thomas Hayden Church as Benjamin's brother, Elle Fanning as Johannson's niece, who obviously has a crush on Ben's son, and Almost Famous's Patrick Fugit as another zoo employee. All well chosen.Two hours of zoo may not sound that appealing. But I was charmed by almost every second of it. Damon gives a wonderful performance, the kind of sweet performance that we don't see very often, and as does Johansson, who is too hot. Sure some of it is a cliché, but it's a cliché that works very well. I haven't been charmed by a Crowe film this much since Crowe's masterwork, Almost Famous.We Bought a Zoo is a harmless movie that really is good. I mainly wanted to see it because I like Crowe's work. Though he doesn't quite reach his Almost Famous or Jerry Maguire level, what he has is good enough for me. Please go to a Redbox and get it. You won't regret it.B+",We Bought a Zoo
60,MattyGibbs,Predictable but enjoyable,8,16 March 2013,This is loosely based on the story of Benjamin Mee who bought a run down Zoo and turned it around. The plot is predictable and there are few surprises throughout the film. Sounds dull doesn't it? However due to likable turns from Mark Wahlberg and Scarlett Johansson and great support from Thomas Haden Church and Elle Fanning this turns out to be an enjoyable film with a fair smattering of comedic moments. This is a family drama and is unlikely to appeal to those who seek a bit of action and few thrills in their films. This is a film that will appeal I think to either a young or older audience. If you are in the mood for a undemanding simple heart warming film then you can't do much better than this.,We Bought a Zoo
61,griffolyon12,A Great Time at the Movies,10,7 January 2012,"Few movies are as genuinely good-natured as We Bought A Zoo, and sometimes it's just fun to watch movies about the human spirit and to realize that life truly is beautiful. In We Bought A Zoo, Matt Damon portrays Benjamin Mee, a widowing father who is now having to care for his fourteen-year-old son and seven-year-old daughter on his own, so what is his solution when his son is expelled from school, to buy and renovate a zoo, of course. What We Bought A Zoo captures so effortlessly is grief and love, how both can often be the same, yearning for lost love, and how one can conquer the other and help a person to carry on with life. Benjamin and his family rediscover love in their newfound home, love with the zoo staff -- from Scarlett Johansson to Elle Fanning -- to the animals themselves, and also rediscover their love for one another. We Bought A Zoo is just honest and true in how it portrays relationships, in how Benjamin tries to figure out his relationship with his distant teenage son, and how he tries to keep his daughter from having to grow up too quickly and help her remain an innocent child. The real winners here are the actors, Damon, Johansson, the kids who portray Benjamin's children -- in particular the too-cute-for-her-own-good Maggie Elizabeth Jones as Rosie -- I especially loved Thomas Haden Church as Benjamin's older brother who lends some of the largest laughs of the movie. Simply what director Cameron Crowe has achieved here is a movie that is funny, touching, and genuinely makes you feel good. Of special note, the music by Sigur Ros' Jonsi accentuates all of the right moments and never misses a beat.I give We Bought A Zoo a 10 out of 10!",We Bought a Zoo
62,Maniac-9,Much more then about a guy who bought a zoo,10,1 February 2012,The movie is marketed and the outside view of the movie would be about a guy who bought a zoo and all that entails. But it's also about a grieving family and them disconnecting and eventually having to come back together as a whole.Benjamin Mee moves his family to a new house to get a fresh start but it's not until after he looks at the perfect place does he realize that it's also a zoo.The zoo that he purchased had been shut down for a few years at that point and they have to overcome those just to re-open the park. One major factor is dealing with an older tiger who's coming to the end of his time and another is when a bear escaped the park and they have to get him back in without incident.,We Bought a Zoo

He was like any teenager in movies, she's always an annoying character, I recommend watching her with the family.",We Bought a Zoo
64,TheSquiss,A tender film that prowls just the right side of twee.,6,17 June 2012,"We Bought a Zoo is the latest feel-good flick from writer/director Cameron Crowe, the man who delighted us with Say Anything, Almost Famous and Jerry Maguire though, alas, there was no killer line on a par with with the latter's ""Shut up, just shut up. You had me at 'hello' "" But don't for a moment think that means I was left disappointed I thoroughly enjoyed it. It's a tender, thoughtful film that prowls the right side of twee. Yes, you know pretty much what you're going to get but the journey is worthwhile. The trailer tells you everything you need to know: Widowed Benjamin Mee (Matt Damon) sells the family home and moves his angry son and sweet daughter to a fantastic house in the country that just happens to have a decrepit zoo in the back garden. Once there, the zoologically inept city boy attempts to inspire, and then learns from, the tiny collection of staff that he's inherited. He hemorrhages cash, battles to understand and reach out to his son, mourns his late wife and builds relationships with his staff, not least of all the fresh-faced, wholesome version (as opposed to the vamped-up, sex goddess version) of Scartlett Johansson (as Kelly).A few plot points dwindle to nothing but the whole is very satisfying. Some of the animals fail to move in the long shots, evidence of budget-preserving models, but when it counts the animals are real, as are the situation and the performances from the principals. The cast is largely convincing but for a couple of pantomime turns from John Michael Higgins as the villainous zoo inspector and Angus Macfadyen as his bitter former colleague. The two children are well cast and avoid the obvious ruts of sickly sweet and despicable creature and we see they both have their own issues and a caring relationship away from the prying eyes of a desperate father.I'm not giving away any plot points when I say it all ends well although Crowe shuns the obvious Hollywood ending and avoids horribly schmaltzy group hugs and mutual blubbing in favour of a gentle understanding of unresolved situations that will be worked out in time. And when, on occasion, it all becomes a little too obvious, the superb soundtrack by Jonsi is distracting enough to make it all good again.Perhaps We Bought a Zoo isn't the pinnacle of Crowe's filmmaking career or as flashy and award-laden as Jerry Maguire but it feels subtler, more real(istic?) and far less contrived. It is also one of those rare occasions where the Hollywoodisation of a true English story is almost certainly an improvement on the reality. Let's face it, buying a zoo in cold, damp Dartmoor doesn't have quite the same romance as lions and rhinos Southern California.Another film review from The Squiss.

65,AvidClimber,We Bought a Zoo — A good family entertainment based on a true story,7,1 April 2013,"We Bought a Zoo is a nice family movie that anyone can appreciate. It has some laughs, a bit of silliness, a dash or romance, a few dramatic scenes, but nothing really intense.The story is interesting and very nice. The actors performed well within the tone of the film. It was a surprising role for Matt Damon, off his usual tense or broody characters. It wasn't his best performance, but he managed well. Scarlett Johansson also did a good job, and I think the one scene where she underperformed was a result of editing or directorial mistakes. Elle Fanning probably gave us the best performance of the cast as the awkward home schooled girl. I was also impressed by the little Maggie Elizabeth Jones who is totally adorable, and completely believable.The most grievous mistake made in that flick, was the end. Bad. The coffee shop scene should have been cut out. Totally unnecessary and just there to satisfy film goers who have to get that extra perfection. A gagging bit, at best.Overall, it's a bit fluffy, but it's good entertainment for the whole family. No disappointment.",We Bought a Zoo
66,nickmesafilms,We Bought a Zoo (2011) - I Want a Zoo Like That!,9,24 May 2012,"You can always count on writer-director Cameron Crowe to give us such classic motion pictures from ""Jerry Maguire"" to ""Almost Famous"". Now, Crowe probably gives us one of his best movies with ""We Bought a Zoo"". This is also one of the most entertaining and heartwarming movies of this or any other year. Based on the remarkable true story, ""We Bought a Zoo"" stars Matt Damon, delivering one of the finest performances of his career, as Benjamin Mee, a desperate single father, trying to fix his family, after his wife's tragic death. Looking for a fresh start, Benjamin ends up moving to a new house, which surprisingly is a zoo! Benjamin now must do what is right to help save the animals of the zoo, while trying to fix his family, as well. Scene after scene, ""We Bought a Zoo"" succeeds in all cylinders of filmmaking. Writer-director Cameron Crowe has hit a triple home-run, scoring yet another brilliant movie. The writing still has that ""Cameron Crowe-feel"", that is traditionally used in most of his movies. The cheesy, but remarkable dialouge, the strong moments that tug at the heart-strings, and some sincerely funny moments, is all that's needed to prove that this is a Cameron Crowe film. A great combination that definitely still works. Besides Damon, the rest of the cast includes Scarlett Johansson as the gorgeous young zoo keeper, Colin Ford in a challenging performance as Benjamin's teenage son, Elle Fanning as the optimistic home-schooled cousin of Johansson's character, Thomas Haden Church in a comic-relief performance as Benjamin's older brother, and Maggie Elizabeth Jones in a adorable performance as Benjamin's 7-year-old daughter. But, it's definitely Matt Damon who carries this movie, delivering such witty and sharp humor, delivering a likable performance, that's easy to cheer on for. Although ""We Bought a Zoo"" is advertised as a family film, the movie contains more realistic and serious situations. Yes, there are some laughs that the family will enjoy, and there will be some moments where you'll be crying tears of joy, but this movie also deals with some strong moments that could break anyone's heart. But, the heart of this movie is beautiful, the acting is superb, the writing is top-notch, and the ending is something to fall in love with. If you feel like taking a break from the big-budget popcorn flicks or the annoyingly bad comedies, then this is the movie for you, a refreshing take on comedy, family drama, and life lessons. This is an absolute enjoyable motion picture that everything in the family will enjoy. You just need 20 seconds of complete courage! ""We Bought a Zoo"", in my review, ""heartwarmingly affective, and beautifully mesmerizing"".",We Bought a Zoo
67,Ramascreen,Why Not?!,9,24 December 2011,"-- www.Ramascreen.com --And the 2011 most feel-good movie goes to WE BOUGHT A ZOO. It's one of the most heartwarming, delightful, pleasant family films you'll see this Holiday season. It's also an excellent grief-themed movie. Great ensemble cast, across the board. This is much lighter than what we usually expect from Cameron Crowe who brought us Jerry Maguire, Almost Famous, and Vanilla Sky, but after leaving us with the meditational Elizabethtown, which I didn't enjoy very much, and then 6 years hiatus, WE BOUGHT A ZOO is a very sweet, very nice comeback, a breath of fresh airWhat I enjoy about Crowe's movies is that there's always something personable about them, and it's no different with WE BOUGHT A ZOO. This film is not preachy, it doesn't hit you like a ton of bricks, it doesn't drag, it doesn't get too sentimental either. It's tender yet firm, a bit predictable yet entertaining. It's one of those movies that make anything seem possible, somewhat of an underdog story, the kind that's generally liked, it's a good way for Crowe to tell the world that he's still in the game, without having to alienate his old fans, while embracing some new ones. Be glad that this is not a talking animal movie. The animals in WE BOUGHT A ZOO serve as a way to challenge the humans on their road to healing and triumph.Matt Damon is a fantastic actor because he can be action man in one movie and he can be your next door regular neighbor joe schmoe in another. As the single dad, Benjamin Mee, Damon channels a certain vulnerability that comes with fatherhood. And Damon shows the sorrow and exhaustion of a newly single parent. I think it's great to see Scarlett Johansson utilizing more than just her good looks. She shows some range that we remember from Lost In Translation, Girl With A Pearl Earring and The Horse Whisperer. Johansson is not believable as a zookeeper, I mean, let's face it,.. if you were to name someone who handles a zoo or cleans animal crap for a living, Johansson would probably the last person on your list, but she seems self-composed, which allows her character to be Mee's listening ear. Outstanding work by the teens in this film, Colin Ford who plays Mee's angry son, Dylan and Elle Fanning who plays the socially awkward Elle Fanning. Their characters embody stereotypical teens and their usual problems with parents and also with peers their age. Ford and Fanning are actors who are going to rock Hollywood someday, you just wait and see.Some things don't work for me, although I admit Maggie Elizabeth Jones who plays the little daughter Rosie is absolutely adorable, I think the film plays out her cuteness way too often, way too much. And I think it's sad that Patrick Fugit who was practically the star of Crowe's 2000 Oscar worthy movie, Almost Famous, doesn't get to have a substantial role in this film. All he mostly does is stand there in the background with a monkey on his back, how sad. Aside from the zoo aspect, the story itself, in its core, is nothing unique but that doesn't necessarily mean a bad thing. It's about difficulties of moving on. The loss of his wife, the mother of his children, leaves a mark that can't easily be replaced by the appeal an unconventional new home. But as the film suggests, sometimes plans change, and all of a sudden it's not about you anymore. And it's not a Crowe movie without such memorable lines like 'Show me the money' and 'you had me at hello', WE BOUGHT A ZOO has a hopeful message of taking chances and gambling on life through 20 seconds of insane courage, loving people, and adventurous, unadulterated joy. And if you're still asking why you should watch this movie, just say to yourself.. why not?!-- www.Ramascreen.com --",We Bought a Zoo
68,Chris_Pandolfi,The Family That Went Wild,7,26 December 2011,"In August of 2006, the Mee family of Devon, England – consisting of DIY columnist and animal lover Benjamin, his brother Duncan, his mother Amelia, and his two children – invested £1.1 million of their own money into the Dartmoor Wildlife Park, a local landmark which opened in 1968 and was forced to close thirty-eight years later after falling on hard times. The eleven-month renovation, which required not only an additional £500,000 but also the family moving into a house on the property, resulted in upgraded pathways, more secure and hospitable animal enclosures, up-to-code restaurants and shops, and the new name of Dartmoor Zoological Park. The enclosures were especially important; prior to the renovation, they had deteriorated to such a degree that the animals would occasionally escape.Mee would go on to write a memoir and be the subject of a four-part BBC documentary series. Now the memoir has been Americanized by Cameron Crowe into the film ""We Bought a Zoo,"" which stars Matt Damon as a fictionalized version of Mee. At one time, he was an adventurous world traveler and reporter; now a widower and a single dad, he finds he's having trouble keeping his head above water. His young daughter, Rosie (Maggie Elizabeth Jones), seems relatively well adjusted, if a little too precocious. His teenage son, Dylan (Colin Ford), is another matter entirely; he's moody, rebellious, angry, and dark, as evidenced by his well-rendered but disturbing drawings of decapitations and other forms of physical harm. He's eventually expelled for stealing money from his school.All the signs point to one thing: It's time to start over. Mee quits his job without accepting a severance package, as he considers it a form of pity. I don't pretend to know how some people's minds work. He then sells his house, hires an upbeat real estate agent (on what just happens to be his first day on the job), and, against the advice of his brother, Duncan (Thomas Haden Church), picks a house located on what appears to be acres of open land. It seems perfect. But there's a catch: The open land is actually a part of a dilapidated zoo. If he agrees to buy the house, he is in effect agreeing to become the zoo's new owner. This means he will have to invest in the zoo's renovation and, most importantly, make sure the animals are properly cared for. It's absolutely insane, but it's also an adventure, the biggest he has ever been faced with. On top of that, it makes Rosie happy. He officially buys a zoo.There to help him is a small but dedicated ragtag band of comedic typecasts, including the guy with a monkey always on his shoulder and the drunken Scot who has made a mortal enemy out of the local safety inspector (John Michael Higgins), who actively looks for defects just for the satisfaction of pointing them out. They're led by Kelly Foster (Scarlett Johansson), the perpetually frazzled twenty-eight-year-old who has no life outside of the zoo. As they all scramble to get the zoo ready in time for a July 7 opening date, they will face numerous personal and professional challenges, including low funds, sick and unruly animals, and unresolved issues. Mee must find a way to connect with his son, who laments the loss of his old house and his friends. Dylan must learn to not be such a boy and actually communicate with Kelly's perky niece, Lily (Elle Fanning). And, of course, Mee and Kelly must come to terms with the fact that they have a crush on each other.There have been many criticisms aimed at this film, and I can't argue with any of them. It's cloying. The characters are essentially one-note stereotypes. This is especially true of Dylan; the only thing missing from his morose personality is the all-black Gothic wardrobe. And as for Rosie, she's just the epitome of cuteness. The plot, while based in reality, has been altered out of all plausibility. Seriously, you have to marvel at the ease with which a zoo can be bought and renovated. But dang it, Crowe is coming from a good place. Shouldn't we expect that of him by now? He has built his reputation on cynicism-free stories that are intended to make the audience feel good. ""We Bought a Zoo"" is sappy and predictable, but it's also irresistibly charming.We know, of course, know that Mee went ahead with this more for himself than for his children. Quite simply, he's trying to escape the memory of his wife. She's seen in flashback sequences, most of which depicting moments of domestic bliss so picturesque, they seem to have been transplanted from a medication commercial. Mee was once told that, if you allow yourself twenty seconds of insanity, your life will change for the better; he lives his life according to that principle, and I honestly don't know if this is inspiring or just plain naïve. Perhaps it's a little bit of both. Whatever the case, this character is what makes ""We Bought a Zoo"" worth recommending. He's just a likable guy; he many not always know what he's doing, but he has his heart in the right place. I don't know how much he is like the actual Benjamin Mee. To be perfectly honest, I don't really care.-- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)",We Bought a Zoo

70,Ryan_MYeah,"It was at least well intentioned, but could it have been ANY more cloying?",5,18 January 2012,"At the end of the day, I found myself underwhelmed by We Bought a Zoo. I really wanted to care for it more than I did, but somewhere during the filming of this movie, the emotional response I should have had just got lost by the film makers. Cameron Crowe at least puts good effort into his direction. His photography is lovely, the music by Jonsi is wonderful (Especially the beautiful ending song ""Gathering Stories""), and Matt Damon, as always, gives a great performance, earning honest sympathy.But this is about as far as I can go. The rest that Crowe does isn't particularly great. There's some decent performances, including Thomas Haden Church's occasional humorous touches, and John Michael Higgins playing... John Michael Higgins. But then we also have Scarlett Johansson, who continues to leave me a bit disappointed, making me wonder if she'll ever prove her excellent performance in Lost in Translation was more than a fluke.Then we get down to Crowe's biggest issue, his own script, which practically shouts mediocre. There's a scene in the film where Damon gives a small, cheesy speech to pep up the zoo workers, and then the film cuts to a small monkey slapping its own forehead. What you might see as a throwaway gag, I saw as an unintentional self metaphor. The movie forces schmaltz on us, especially in the dialogue, which is seriously awful. I sometimes hear people complaining about War Horse, mainly because detractors point fingers at so called ""forced sentimentality"".

I've heard lots about it, news circulating that it was a great film by a unsuspecting director. There's not much to this prologue, except I became intrigued and wanted to see what would happen..I really did like it. I loved how the plot was so simplistic and low- key, that nothing could really stop you from watching it with a heart. The first thing I really loved was the cast. We have Matt Damon (great actor, with great diversity) Scarlett Johansson (pretty actor that I've known and loved from Lost in Translation) and lots of others underrated actors. They all did a great job playing their parts, albeit some scenes coming across cheesy. And that reminds me, the style of the film.. It really doesn't want to be as complex as you think, and the acting isn't bad at all. People may glance at it and think it is, but I thought the acting contained lots of heart and soul. It takes a lot for that to happen. Everything else was done with a similar fashion, and the film is glossed over with some emotional aspects. And for a family film, it was really refreshing to see. And to keep this alongside the film, I'm not going to go into full details. The movie was simplistic, sweet, and hopeful. So will this review.

I find it hard to believe that he needed to make this movie for anything else but to keep busy. Maybe Hollywood is tougher and tougher for good actors to find movies in which to act. The movie is boring, and doesn't seem to get anywhere. The only one who got somewhere was me when I decided to get out of it and watch youtube instead. I did not even finish it. I must give a mark.

This is a delightful, well thought out, and thoroughly enjoyable film that touches on some very sensitive subjects and shines like a beacon through it all. Matt Damon and Thomas Haden Church have a charisma which bonds them on the screen and helps the audience to identify with them as brothers. Damon's charm and gentle personality is disarming, and his ability to transcend the ""Bourne"" image shows just how capable and talented an actor he has become. Scarlett's role is equally challenging from past performances, particularly with her ""Black Widow"" persona about to be displayed across the big screen in the Avengers, but she plays the part of the zoo keeper with a sensitivity that reaches off the screen and into your heart. Elle Fanning, Colin Ford, and Maggie Elizabeth Jones all give excellent performances in their roles as the younger generations dealing with the realities of loss, life, and just being kids. John Michael Higgins and Angus Macfayden lend an air of comedy with out going over the top, giving just the right tones to this impressive film. Since family films rarely make it to the Oscars, we probably won't see this one on the dais next year, but it is a shame, since the film is a testimony to great cinema. Rated PG for language and theme, I can't see why the preteens wouldn't enjoy this as well as the rest of the family.

There isn't any cute animal to steal the show though.The romance between the two couples aren't very convincing.

80,julian-mumford,A good family film,7,27 July 2012,"Faced with a life changing experience, people often act in ways they have not done before. Whether buying an open top sports car, taking up a new hobby or basically just reassessing their lives.Benjamin Me (Damon) is forced to make these choices following the tragic death of his much beloved wife and mother of his two children.Luckily his daughter Rosie Me (Maggie Elizabeth Jones), a seven year old going on forty, is very supportive. Arguably the cutest movie child ever, with screen charisma well beyond her years, she almost acts everyone else off the screen.However, Benjamin's son is another matter. Dylan (Colin Ford) is moody, with cloudy sullen expressions and seemingly just one step away from a trenchcoat and an automatic assault rifle. With the art projects he produces, it is no wonder he keeps getting expelled from school.Benjamin believes a move would do the family some good, putting some distance from all the ghosts and the places he and his wife shared. Finally settling on the property of his and Rosie's dreams, there are two slight catches.Number one, Dylan considers this banishment to the wilds as tantamount to death. This can be overcome, no biggie. After all, Dylan hates everything and everyone, so one more thing will not matter.The second point though is more challenging, the house comes attached to a Zoo, with a specific requirement to keep trading, otherwise the animals go to the great enclosure in the sky.We later get to meet the eclectic group who run the establishment, now under Benjamin's inexperienced care. Kelly (Scarlett Johnasson) is in charge and knows everything that needs to be done, including keeping the inspector Ferris (Higgns) happy, with or without his rather suggestive extending tape measure.We have various keepers, all with minor quirks and foibles who help to jolly the story along, there are enough trials and tribulations to keep the audience happy but the end result for most, will not be in serious doubt.There is a feeling that all the character arcs are completed rather neatly but the story is sound, based on true events on Dartmoor in the UK, here transplanted to a distinctly sunnier and American audience centered, Southern California.The acting is solid, as mentioned before, young Jones as ""Rosie"" has more looks and expressions that any seven year old should possess, clearly a bright future awaits her on this evidence. Johansson is the potential love interest but this is largely downplayed, although Johansson is sexy enough without also dressing her in a Zoo uniform.Thomas Hayden Church as Benjamin's brother acts as the voice of reason and gets some good lines and we also meet Elle Fanning, who soothes Dylan's troubled brow. With less to do here but showing good promise after her excellent appearance in ""Super 8"".Matt Damon provides a likable everyman performance, dialing down the star wattage and this anchors the film, allowing the more eclectic characters to bounce their eccentricities off the main character.The film possibly suffered at the box office following the unrelated intentional release of many exotic animals by a Mentally Ill American Zoo owner around the time of the films release. Unfortunately, local law enforcement ""contained"" the problem by shooting dead many of the released animals in the interests of public safety, not the best advance PR for a film of this type.Summary A good family film, based on a true story albeit ""embellished"" and transplanted to an American setting.Harmless and wholesome gentle entertainment driven by Matt Damon's easy star power.http://julesmoviereviews.blogspot.co.nz/",We Bought a Zoo
81,patsworld,Film Clips Don't Do This Movie Justice,8,5 January 2012,"We Bought A Zoo is a heart-warming, fun movie. The casting is a good as you could wish for and if I had to choose, I'd pick this as my favorite Matt Damon film. For anyone who loves animals, and I have to confess I'm about head of the line as one of them, this is a marvelous picture with not only the people personalities shining forth, but so too the animals. In most cases, we all know that the brief film clips shown prior to the movie are supposed to be showing the best of the picture. In this case, that is far from the truth. I almost passed this delightful movie up because all I could think of was, if this is the best there is...I don't think so. I'm so glad I opted to see it in spite of my reservations. Who ever picked the preview clips should be fired...or retrained, perhaps, because what they went with most certainly didn't do this movie justice. Not even close. It's a really enjoyable movie and I'd recommend it to everyone.",We Bought a Zoo
82,Dar Star,Can't believe I like this movie,7,28 March 2018,"This kind of movie is not the type I usually gravitate to, but since I'm a huge Matt Damon fan, I decided to give it a shot. I don't know how to encapsulate it,but the story just works. It's charming and has just enough humor to keep the story light. Definitely worth checking out.",We Bought a Zoo
83,drpakmanrains,Pleasant Fare With Limited Appeal,8,24 December 2011,"Cameron Crowe has made a film ""We Bought A Zoo"" which, while considered a family film, may have a hard time finding a large audience. This is not to say the film isn't good. It is good, and overall an enjoyable experience. But at the first night show I attended, the audience was about 50% seniors, like myself, and there were only 2 children in the rather small audience. This is because, despite a fine cast, the film is a bit too cute and predictable for most of the 18-35 crowd, and not cute or fast enough for the preteen crowd.The story is based on a book, which is based on a true story of a widowed father, played here by Matt Damon, and his two children, a 7 hear old daughter, (adorable Maggie Elizabeth Jones), and a 14 year old son, (Colin Ford). They are all mourning the recent loss of their mother, and finding it very hard to go on with their lives. When the teenage boy starts to become angry and depressed, drawing horrible pictures and failing in school, Dad decides to move the family to a more rural setting. Of course by the title, you know they buy an old fixer, which happens to have a zoo which has been forced to close for financial reasons and is being minimally maintained by a staff so the animals can survive.Without giving any details, much of what happens can be figured out early, especially when Dakota Fanning's sister Elle, age 13 is on this staff, and the curator is Scarlett Johannson. But the animals are quite interesting, and there is no attempt to make them cutesy, which may disappoint younger children, but is appropriate to today's attitudes regarding caging animals, which this film clearly reinforces.I found the film to vacillate between very engaging dramatic and heartfelt moments, with some scenes that seemed to be overly stated, or melodramatic. Matt Damon was very believable throughout, and so was Colin Ford, who few have seen before, though I saw him in a little known film from 2007, ""Dog Days of Summer"", which starred Devon Gearhart, a fine child actor at the time, but who was overshadowed by Colin's excellent performance. Maggie Jones is very cute, but is given some lines that few 7 year old kids would say, typical of trying to make children too precocious in many of today's films.I gave this film 8 stars, though 7.5 would be closer to my feeling. I tend to see films I expect to enjoy, and I did enjoy this one, so most of my ratings are at least a 5 or 6. Thus while I think this was a fine film, it may not have enough elements to attract a large adult or child audience. I have not been a big Cameron Crowe fan, though I did like ""Jerry Maguire"" and ""Almost Famous"", and his musical interests always make the soundtracks enjoyable, this film no exception. In summary, if you go, I think you will like it, but don't expect it to blow you away.",We Bought a Zoo

85,jdonalds-5,Great family movie for children 8-10 years and up.,8,18 April 2015,"I really liked this movie. It is just a simple family friendly movie but being simple is one of it's strengths. Most of all I thought Matt Damon not only acted really well in his part, but I can't think of another actor who would have been better suited.I've seen Matt Damon in a few movies (Good Will Hunting, The Borne series, etc.) but in each case I thought Mr Damon was a little too pompous. In some of those movies being pompous might have been the right characteristic but every movie he was in came out the same. In this movie Mr. Damon was very sincere and quite believable. I really liked him and he carried the whole movie very well.The director Cameron Crowe did a great job with the pace and story line. Whoever picked the two young girls sure had an eye for cute and both girls did a great job acting. Scarlett Johansson was good too.I watched this to see if we could watch it as a family with our precocious five year old. But while it is a very good family movie it is just a bit to subtle for him, and it isn't the sort of fun, even a bit silly, movie for a five year old. I'm sure he would watch it and not get bored but he certainly wouldn't grasp some of the depth of the story.I do believe I will buy this movie. And these days of streaming I don't buy many DVDs.",We Bought a Zoo
86,Treyroo,"Not amazing, but good",7,24 November 2012,"""Life is an adventure"". A cliché if ever there was one. But for some people, it just so happens to be true. And Matt Damon is portraying one such person in this latest family effort from acclaimed writer/director Cameron Crowe.Benjamin Mee (Matt Damon) is an adventure columnist for a struggling newspaper, if that's not redundant, and father of two children. His wife recently passed away due to illness leaving him to raise those children on his own. His daughter Rosie (played by Maggie Elizabeth Jones) is regularly losing sleep thanks to the hard-partying college students in the house next door. His son Dylan (played by Colin Ford) is a fourteen year-old artist who's developed a taste for the macabre of late and who has recently been expelled from school. Rather than keep his job at the paper, which he would've held onto despite their financial problems thanks to his editor's sympathy, Mee decides to sell his home and find more picturesque surroundings for him and his family. After rejecting several houses for being dull or dime-a-dozen, they find a home situated on the grounds of a struggling zoo and embark on their greatest adventure yet.It's cutesy, I'm not denying that. But while Zookeeper had nothing else going for it, this is entertaining and interesting and I enjoyed it very much thanks to Crowe's screenplay and direction, a typically interesting effort from Damon and an excellent supporting cast in Elle Fanning, Thomas Hayden Church and Scarlett Johansson.",We Bought a Zoo
87,bdgill12,"Some GREAT, Real Moments Wrapped Up in a Family-Friendly, Candy Shell",6,28 December 2011,"I think making a family-friendly movie that is also significant is one of the harder tasks a filmmaker can undertake. Making a film that appeals to a wide range of demographics is difficult enough but when you factor in the need to entertain both six and sixty year-olds, you've got a tough task ahead of you. This is why Pixar succeeds every year (2011 excluded) whereas Dreamworks is hit or miss, why I'll see The Muppets a hundred times but will never again take in Bedtime Stories. We Bought a Zoo illustrates these difficulties in some spectacular and truly frustrating ways.Our protagonist is Benjamin Mee (Matt Damon), an adventure writer who recently became a widower. His daughter, six year-old Rosie (Maggie Elizabeth Jones), has handled the loss well but Benjamin is constantly at odds with his son, 14 year-old Dylan (Colin Ford). When Dylan finally gets himself expelled from school, Benjamin decides it's time for a change and after an exhausting search for a new house, he finally finds the perfect home. The only problem is that the property comes along with a small zoo, including 47 species of animals and a crew of employees. Despite the obstacles and the advice of his brother (Thomas Haden Church), Benjamin opts to buy the zoo and takes his children off on an adventure that will bring more drama than he could ever dream of along with the healing he and his family so badly need.I'm a huge fan of writer/director Cameron Crowe and I readily look forward to anything and everything that he does. This outing certainly won't change that feeling but it isn't one of his better works. Simply put, We Bought a Zoo wants desperately to be both family-friendly and cinematically relevant and that mix just doesn't blend seamlessly. Crowe's usual brand of fresh, casual, and well-versed dialogue is muddled with predictable clichés. It often borders on becoming cheesy and it is almost always cloying, working extra-hard to force a connection that isn't always there. There are a number of scenes which are just fine in terms of post-Christmas feelgoodery but fall flat in terms of really mattering. This uneven mix seems to negatively affect some characters and actors more than others. Ford and John Michael Higgins (as a zoo inspector) both jump back and forth between good and bad scenes and Elle Fanning, who was so good in this summer's Super 8, doesn't have any feel for her character whatsoever. I think she's supposed to be the teenage version of the manic pixie dream girl but instead she just comes off as an idiot. Add in a will-they-won't-they romantic relationship between Benjamin and his head zookeeper, Kelly (Scarlett Johansson), that would have been better off left on the cutting room floor and you get a cliché-riddled narrative that doesn't do much to inspire.When We Bought a Zoo excels is when it gets real. Damon gives a subtle, craftsman-like performance and does an outstanding job of conveying an awful lot about his character in unspoken ways. You genuinely feel for Benjamin and it is the genuine sympathy that Damon elicits that serves as an example of what could have been had the film gone in a different direction. Interactions between Benjamin and Dylan and Benjamin and Kelly in the second act are powerful, filled with emotion that is wholly appropriate for the situation. There's a story arc involving Benjamin's relationship with an aging tiger that hits home on a number of levels. The flip side of this is that these moments are much more tense and dramatic than the family-fun exhibited throughout the rest of the film and if Crowe had continued to expound upon these plot points, there's no way We Bought a Zoo would succeed with the kiddos.It should be noted that none of this film's issues are deal breakers. It is funny, entertaining, and totally acceptable family film that never allows its flaws to become cringe-worthy or painful. In essence, it is Dolphin Tale and there's nothing wrong with Dolphin Tale. But with Crowe, Damon, and a potentially impactful subject matter involved, it could have been better than it is.",We Bought a Zoo
88,Macleanie,Local story,5,18 June 2019,"To me the original story of Ben Mee is local, I live 5 minutes away from Dartmoor Zoo and have visited the home to its wonderful animals. As for the hollywood adaptation of this beautiful story..well knowing the original story in full theres a lot of changes and isn't whole heartedly true. Things have been tweaked for whatever reason to help the perception on the big screen. That said it doesn't effect it too much, this is a story of heart and that is felt through its adaptation also. This is due to a wonderful cast and wonderful acting, but still I feel more could have been made of the talent on offer. We Bought a Zoo has fabulous charm. It focus's on a families struggle rather than its animals, also on a group of unconventional workers with grit and determination which rubs off on a lost and vulnerable city widow, father of two. For me this isn't the ideal family movie due to its drama and ideologies which kids won't grasp. I don't think Crowe knew its audience but felt the need to produce a movie based on the wonderful narrative on offer. Im delighted with the movie and this story being told to a wider audience which has provided lots of income to a still struggling day by day zoo. The zoo has been totally hollywooded out to complete over the top fakeness but the story is as whole hearted and fascinating as they come.",We Bought a Zoo

90,Manal1987,"""Twenty seconds of insane courage...""",9,7 April 2012,"Why this movie flopped at the box-office is beyond me! We Bought a Zoo is one of those movies that make you feel good about life and everything around you. It follows the true story of a tragedy-stricken family who search for a new start in an urban property that turns out to be an endangered zoo. Despite the recent death of his loving wife, the father (Matt Damon) tires to reconnect with his children and help them overcome the loss. Not only does he try to save his children, but also the animals and the zookeepers he suddenly became responsible for.The movie interweaves the three worlds of humans, animals and nature contriving a universal language of love and faith. It finds hope in the middle of despair, courage in the middle of fear, and life in the middle of death. All this brought together in a humorous, light-hearted way. Everything about this drama is so good-natured and simple: the performance, the scenery, the music (actually, Jonsi's music gave much soul to the film). Both Damon and Colin Ford excelled in beautifully portraying the emotionally intense relationship between a caring father and an estranged son.I guess Cameron Crowe (director of Jerry MaGuire and Almost Famous) has done it again. Definitely a must-see.",We Bought a Zoo
91,DJRMewzique,A superb return for Cameron Crowe,8,29 December 2011,"""We Bought a Zoo,"" based on the memoir of Benjamin Mee, is a terribly touching true story of an adventurous man who tries to bring his family back together and get a fresh start by quiting his job as a journalist, selling his house and, yes, buying a struggling zoo.If this film were a work of fiction, you might think that it was produced as nothing more than a vehicle to get Damon, starring here as the aforementioned Mee, an Oscar nomination and to get the audience in tears. However, having been based on the real life adventure of Mr. Mee, the end result leaves you not caring how much was fictionalized for the Kleenex crowd: if this film doesn't touch you, you may just be dead inside.Although this may not be Damon's best performance to date, it is still one of his strongest, taking on the role of a single father (ack, am I getting that old that the still hot Damon is now playing a parent?!) dealing with the death of a wife whom he loves with every fibre of his being. He shows real acting maturity here as his heartfelt execution of a dishevelled man trying to deal with an enormous loss and a troubled son (played with perfection by ""Supernatural"" star Colin Ford), who is feeling just as lost as his father, may have been overlooked by the Golden Globes but still has a simmering Oscar buzz going.And not one to be a huge fan of ""cute kid actors,"" relative newcomer Maggie Elizabeth Jones may be one of the absolutely most adorable child actors on the face of the planet.Rounding out the cast is the stunning Scarlett Johansson as Kelly Foster, the zoo-keeper Mee takes on as part of the purchase of the property, who tries desperately to look somewhat plain yet cannot help but radiate her absolute beauty even under imperfect hair and a complete lack of sexy outfits.Director Cameron Crowe (""Singles,"" ""Jerry Maguire"") makes a long-overdue resurgence here with an absolutely beautiful film about life, loss and, ultimately, hope. I would be hard pressed to deny that I haven't been thinking how I could give that ""20 seconds of courage"" a shot. And by the teary, heartfelt conclusion of an exceptionally sweet dramedy, I think you might just be wondering the same thing.",We Bought a Zoo

93,skullislandsurferdotcom,New Zoo Review,7,27 December 2011,"Here's a far-fetched premise remarkably based on a true story which includes a good cast, great tunes (including Bob Dylan), and loads of the usual sunny optimism ala director Cameron Crowe to make even the biggest flaws not matter.Matt Damon, six months after losing his wife, takes his two children – a sweet little girl and a brooding teenage boy – to find a new house in a new town. Turns out their dream home is on the property of... a zoo! Most of the film deals with the restoration and coping with the sporadic obstacles including an uptight inspector who could shut everything down; an aged sick tiger; a dangerous bear; and worst of all, dwindling funds.Scarlett Johansson is a nice distraction, serving more than the obvious love-interest; as chief of operations and the only real expert on board, she's the one character who keeps it all moving. It's fun seeing the zoo morph from a shamble to the real thing, but overlong scenes dealing with the teenage son – too deep and honest to be realistic – ruins the overall flow... As do moments when the little girl tries way too hard to win the cutie pie of the year award.But with all the people and animals on board, it's really Damon's solo venture: In dealing with the memory of his wife while battling constant snags that could keep his dreams from coming true, he's a down-home protagonist to not only care about, but root for.For More Reviews: www.cultfilmfreaks.com",We Bought a Zoo

95,Reel_starz,Sunshine. People. Joy.,8,27 November 2011,"Why should I like We Bought a Zoo? On paper, Cameron Crowe's latest self-discovery romance is a mess: it's sentimental, manipulative and self-conscious – no different from countless other inspirational family movies, from 2008's Marley and Me to 2011's inexplicably successful Dolphin Tale. And yet, against all logic, We Bought a Zoo doesn't fall into that trap. The difference between this and, say, The Blind Side, is that in the former, at least for the most part, the romanticism feels genuine, not a cheap method of pandering to parents in search of a family-friendly movie (for the record, I don't imagine that many children will find We Bought a Zoo all that interesting, despite numerous shots of animals). Thanks to a capable cast, Crowe's spirited direction and, of course, the pitch-perfect soundtrack, We Bought a Zoo is far better than it has any right to be.Whether you enjoy We Bought a Zoo most likely depends on how you feel about director/co-writer Cameron Crowe. After the dark, bizarre Vanilla Sky and the meditative Elizabethtown, this represents Crowe's return to the energetic, lighthearted fare that made him popular and features many of his usual tropes, including the memorable, somewhat cheesy dialogue; the aimless male protagonist; the quirky sense of humor; the precocious child. Having fallen in love with Jerry Maguire and Almost Famous, I was both excited and anxious for We Bought a Zoo, hoping for a career comeback for Crowe but also accepting that the chances of it being a widespread success were slim. The result is similar to what I anticipated: a heartwarming, if occasionally schmaltzy ode to the power of love. Although lacking the vivacious wit of Jerry Maguire and the nostalgic ease of Almost Famous, We Bought a Zoo has a charm of its own in its belief in happy endings and the strength of the human spirit. Thus, while those who dislike Crowe's brand of all-American naiveté will probably find the movie intolerably sentimental and disingenuous, those like me, who are less opposed to starry-eyed optimism, will discover moments of surprising emotional honesty.Much kudos must be given to the cast, particularly the five main actors. Matt Damon is a perfect fit for Cameron Crowe, imbuing his character with just the right blend of cheerful vitality and quiet sorrow to prevent him from becoming cartoonish and delivering even the most questionable lines with tireless aplomb. Once again, he proves his ability to seamlessly inhabit virtually any role, as, with his graying hair and pudgy physique, he is one of the few A-list actors that can convincingly play a completely ordinary father of two. Taking over the prerequisite ""friend"" role, Thomas Haden Church puts his dry pragmatism to good use, evening out the bubbly dynamism that saturates the rest of the movie, and, although not as impressive as in J.J. Abram's Super 8, Elle Fanning displays admirable maturity for an actress her age, proving that she is undeniably one to watch out for. Nonetheless, the biggest surprises are Scarlett Johansson and Colin Ford. The matter-of-fact foil to Damon's idealist, Johansson goes against type, shedding her usual sylphlike sensuality in favor of something more down-to-earth and restrained, displaying a subtle composure evocative of her work in such films as The Horse Whisperer and Ghost World. As the bitter, volatile Dylan, arguably the juiciest part in the movie, newcomer Colin Ford (whose most notable credit so far is a recurring guest spot on the TV show Supernatural) displays considerable self-control, turning what could have easily been a stereotypical, angst-ridden teen into a complex person. Like Alex Schaffer, who had a similar turn in Win Win, he joins an astonishingly long list of promising young performers this year.We Bought a Zoo is not perfect. Unlike the aforementioned actors, young Maggie Elizabeth Jones does not fare so well as Mee's innocent, outspoken daughter. She is undoubtedly adorable, yet she is never quite believable and fails to transcend the angelic child cliché the way Jonathan Lipnicki did in Jerry Maguire, and some of her scenes are almost cringe-worthy in their excessive cuteness. The first thirty minutes are uneven, relying too heavily on ham-fisted idiosyncrasies and rather clumsy attempts at humor, which is a shame since it is precisely those moments that Crowe handled with perfection in romantic comedies like Jerry Maguire and Say Anything. The scenes involving the amateur real estate agent are especially unpleasant; luckily, there are only a few. Only after the family moves into the new house and begins to interact with the zoo workers does the movie find its groove.The 2011 movie year has brought a surprising trend: a return to optimism. From the wide-eyed wonder of Super 8 to the whimsical nostalgia of The Artist, numerous films have displayed a willingness to break from the dark cynicism that has suffused recent cinema and embrace a newfound sanguinity. Maybe, then, We Bought a Zoo could not have been released at a better time. With its boundless energy and can-do attitude, not to mention radiant cinematography and sweeping score (composed by none other than Jónsi of Sigur Ros fame), this is the epitome of exuberance, a bright declaration of faith in humanity rarely seen in modern film. At first, I was hesitant to accept We Bought a Zoo (something about its brazen cheer felt outdated, contrived), yet around the halfway mark, I realized that I was tearing up. Then, during an unexpectedly raw argument scene, I outright cried. Maybe the movie is nothing but a cheap ploy for emotion, a series of scenes designed to manipulate viewers into experiencing feelings inorganic to the story and characters, an inauthentic, condescending portrait of false ideals. In the end, though, I couldn't help but succumb to the film's bold sensitivity, its simple tale of triumph over adversity and redemption through love. To answer the question posed at the beginning of this review, I will say what Benjamin Mee would probably say: Why not?",We Bought a Zoo

97,socialmedia-437-956449,Learning about hope,6,15 August 2012,"In this amiable family drama, middle aged widower Benjamin Mee (Matt Damon) is unable to hold together his grieving family of two children, after the passing of his wife to cancer. In an attempt for a new adventure and fresh start, he falls in love with a house surrounded by a beautiful forest, but is told that the main condition of purchase is to maintain the zoo that comes attached to the property. He takes the risk and moves from the city to the menagerie which needs a major overhaul before it is to reopen to the public.A journalist writing adventure columns, Benjamin is lacking stories to share and finds himself resigning from the newspaper. In part, this is to escape the sympathetic looks of his boss and colleagues. At the same time, his fourteen-year old son Dylan (Colin Ford) has just been expelled from school for theft while displaying introverted behavior, expressed through dark paintings of monsters colored in black and blood red.Based on a memoir by Benjamin Mee, moving to a dilapidated zoo was the last effort of a despairing widow looking for any means of happiness. His trigger to this big step is the look of joy on the face of his seven year-old daughter Rosie (Maggie Elizabeth Jones) at the sight of the zoo's animals. In their old neighborhood, the Mees are looking to escape the overwhelming memories of their deceased wife and mother.But coming with no experience in the field of animals and zoo, he didn't expect all the expenditures that may be involved in the process, draining his financial savings and inheritance, while tensions with his son grow more intense. The moving in period is tougher than expected, especially now that a full time staff headed by Kelly Foster (Scarlett Johansson) and featuring Elle Fanning, were hoping to find in Benjamin a rescuer who will save their jobs and the animals. So far, anyone who promised to open the zoo has ended up reselling it. The fear is that Benjamin will follow the same fate of previous owners as he develops more doubts and concerns.From now on the premise seems predictable, conflict is here and Ben struggles with the challenge of restoring glory to the zoo. In Scarlett Johansson, he finds a new romance. Cameron Crowe, who previously directed the feel-good ""Jerry Maguire"" and the meditative ""Vanilla Sky"", doesn't pull out any of his usual box of tricks here. Instead, ""We Bought a Zoo"" has a rather simplistic narrative, but manages to create emotions and engages viewers with the fate of this grieving family, thanks to the performance of Matt Damon and the children.If the film does provide gratification, it is due to the pure conversations between Benjamin and his daughter. But it is disappointing to have all these great elements of nature and animals and not to take advantage. The inhabitants of the zoo are filmed with an ordinariness which could have been spiced up with a touch of cinematographic magic.Human connections are the strongest bond within the family Mee. The relationships are sincere and profound. The rest of the characters, however, are underdeveloped, attempting to create a forced sense of humor. The only exception here, of course, is Scarlett Johansson, who is the basis of a new love angle.After the flops of ""Vanilla Sky"" and ""Elizabethtown"", Cameron Crowe has managed to come back to mainstream cinema again. ""We Bought a Zoo"" is an enjoyable film that will see adults shed some tears while their children enjoy the hatching of eggs. Everyone will learn about hope and the will to go on.",We Bought a Zoo

102,keiichi73,"We Bought a Zoo, but should you buy a ticket?",4,28 November 2011,"Cameron Crowe's We Bought a Zoo is a harmless movie about some very nice people who, yes, end up buying a zoo when they go looking for a new place to live. Unfortunately, while the movie is harmless, it's also not very interesting. Same goes for the people. They're nice and all, but don't seem to have a lot on their minds. Even the zoo animals seem kind of bored. This certainly isn't a bad movie, just a very familiar one.The film is based on the true story of Benjamin Mee (played here by Matt Damon), a single father who is coping with the recent passing of his wife, and having to raise his two children on his own. His teenage son, Dylan (Colin Ford) is your typical isolated young man, who expresses himself by getting in trouble at school, and drawing graphic pictures of death in class. His younger daughter, Rosie (Maggie Elizabeth Jones), is one of those cloying little movie kids who always has something cute or clever to say on cue whenever the camera is pointed at her. He also has a supportive brother (Thomas Haden Church), who is mainly there for sarcastic comic relief. Benjamin decides the time has come for a change when Dylan is expelled from school, and he himself becomes fed up with his newspaper job, and walks off. He wants to start a new life for himself and his family.He finds the perfect home somewhere in the Southern California countryside. Naturally, it's the one that the realtor seems the most nervous about, due to the fact that the house comes with its own struggling private zoo. In what has to be one of the biggest impulse buys in the history of cinema, Benjamin decides to buy the house when he sees how happy his little daughter is around the animals. I certainly hope there was more than that behind his decision to buy the property in real life. The family moves in, and they take charge of the zoo, which comes with its own staff of colorful stock characters. There's Kelly the zookeeper (Scarlett Johansson), who serves as somewhat of a love interest for Benjamin. The zoo's staff even has a teenage zookeeper (Elle Fanning) to act as a love interest for Dylan. There's an attempt at a subplot about Fanning's character trying to help Dylan come out of the emotional shell he's been in since his mother died. Too bad it never really works on an emotional level. Maybe if she had been written as an actual character, rather than someone whose main character trait is to smile a lot.The rest of the staff is made up of eccentrics and oddballs that the movie can't think of anything to do with, so they're not worth mentioning. I understand what Crowe was going for here - He wanted to make a big-hearted movie about a family's emotional healing after a crisis, and how this family adventure of trying to run the zoo brought them closer together. You can literally see the screenplay co-written by Crowe trying its hardest to push our emotional buttons. You can also see him throwing just about every audience-pleasing trick in the book. A cute child, a shy teen romance, the struggle to save a sick tiger, a monkey who makes cute little reactions to what the characters say, a father trying to move on from his painful past, as well as connect with his emotionally distant son...It gets to be a bit much. I have not read the book that inspired this film, so I don't know if things actually happened this way. But, it felt awfully manipulative and contrived to me.I was also put off by the severe tonal shifts that go on throughout the movie. The stuff concerning Damon and his son are actually pretty good, and there are some honest moments. But then, there are a lot of moments that are so overly sentimental or broad that they seem like they belong in a different movie. Thomas Haden Church is one of my favorite actors, but his role as the dry-witted brother is out of place. He's like a character on a sitcom, his every word a sarcastic quip. Equally out of place is John Michael Higgins, who plays the film's villain, a safety inspector who wants to close down the zoo, and does his best to find problems with it. Higgins plays the part too broad. As soon as he steps out of the car with that confident and smug smirk plastered on his face, you know what role he's supposed to play. And that smirk never leaves his face. It's like he's silently telling us at all times, ""Yep, I'm a jerk. How can I be so terrible to these nice people? Don't you just hate me?"" We Bought a Zoo wants to wear its great big heart on its sleeve, and it does. But then, for some reason, it thinks we don't notice, so it keeps on hammering good, sunny feelings into each scene to the point that I started to feel assaulted by the film's manipulations. Like I said, I have not read the book that the film is based on, but I have a sneaking suspicion it's more honest and subtle than what's up on the screen. It has to be, because it's real life. This movie is an overly sunny, sitcom-level imitation of real life.",We Bought a Zoo
103,jamuckley,We Bought a Zoo... it may just take 20 seconds of insane courage,8,20 April 2012,"Who knew that you could create an uplifting and inspiring family film out of the tragedy of losing a parent in your pre-teen years?Check out my full review here: http://reelstorymovies.blogspot.com/2012/04/we-bought-zoo.htmlThat's exactly what We Bought a Zoo did in their film starring Matt Damon (Benjamin Mee), Scarlett Johansson (Kelly Foster), Thomas Haden Church (Duncan Mee) and Elle Fanning (Lily Miska). The film is a moving depiction of life after loss for the surviving spouse and hurting children who are left behind. The film demonstrates the aftermath of death and its effects on the entire family.The film depicts the struggle between father and son as Damon's character, Benjamin tries to guide his hurting 14-year old son, Dylan (played by Colin Ford) through his first year of high school and his the first year of his life without his mom. Dylan's only solace from the pain of loss comes in his artwork, which features dark depictions of decapitations and scary creatures. He has been struggling at school all semester when he is caught stealing and forces the principal's hand to expel him from school.This development prompts Benjamin to look for a change of scenery. His work has been affected by the death of his wife and he finally quits the job, and looks to pack up and move to some place with a big backyard outside of the city. The constant ray of sunlight in the film is Rosie (Maggie Elizabeth Jones), Benjamin's 7-year-old daughter, who seems to be handling the loss the best of everyone in the film.On Benjamin and Rosie's house hunting trip they come upon an older home with 18 acres of backyard. Despite warnings from his Realtor, Benjamin thinks they have finally found their new home. It is miles from the nearest store, has lots of room to roam and one catch: it's a zoo!Against his better judgment and his brother Duncan's admonitions, Benjamin in an act of desperation to escape the never-ending grieving process and to boost the overall morale of the family decides to buy the zoo.Upon later reflection, Benjamin makes a bold comment about his approach to life and about taking chances. He says, ""You know, sometimes all you need is twenty seconds of insane courage. Just literally twenty seconds of just embarrassing bravery. And I promise you, something great will come of it.""It's a statement of courage, bravery, but ultimately faith.Faith is stepping out into something without guarantees. It is doing something no one else would even attempt. It is putting yourself out there with everything to lose, but so much more to gain.Against all hope, faith accomplishes the impossible.The film portrays the real-life story of a man who lost everything when his wife died, but refused to give up and went for everything by selling his house, to take his family on an incredible adventure.The film's story speaks to something inside of mankind. It speaks to a place of complacency and routine. It challenges you where you are to consider your life. To take a step back and examine what you are doing and why you are doing it. Benjamin's wife's death was a wakeup call for him that he chased after other people's adventures as a journalist, but never really experienced his own adventure.Sometimes it takes something drastic. It takes something life-altering in order to live in such a way that you become really alive; not going through the motions; not just doing what you have always done. But truly living it a way that has an impact.As Christians, we are called to be the salt of the earth and a city on a hill. We are called to stand out and to make a difference in the lives of those around us. We aren't to remain idle, watching those around us, instead, we are to participate in the lives of those we interact with. In order to get out of that rut it occasionally requires a leap of faith. It requires ""getting out of the boat"" metaphorically speaking, like Peter who had been with Jesus and didn't want to just watch, but wanted to participate in what was going on around him.In order to change the world it might just take twenty seconds of insane courage to step out and do something extraordinary.My Score – Overall Rating: 8 out of 10 Plot: 7 out of 10 Character Development: 8 out of 10 Acting: 8 out of 10 Audio/Visuals: 9 out of 10",We Bought a Zoo
104,mfrost71w,Cliché after cliché,3,25 July 2017,"This film takes every cliché from every Hollywood romantic comedy and animal film of the last 60 years and stitches them into a single vomit-inducing tear-jerker. There is not one second of footage that is unique - every scene, every plot device, every character, every film trick, you will recognize from a hundred other films. It is a Frankenstein monster of a movie, long-dead parts sewn together into a shambling barely-alive whole. It comes across as a poor made-for-TV movie made by people who had been fired by Disney for being too schmaltzy. Based on the book of a true story in England, the film omits or changes all the good parts of the book and replaces them with Hollywood clichés, for what reason is not known. No redeeming qualities whatsoever, it is a feel-good movie for the retarded",We Bought a Zoo

106,bonsai-superstar,"Of Lasagna, Pizza, and Sandwiches",5,21 March 2012,"Do you relate to women who base not only an entire relationship, but even love not on conversation or shared experience but on simply bringing a person a sandwich? Do you consider simply throwing money at life's problems an ""adventure""? Do you fantasize about meeting a rich, available man who pines for his dead wife (showing he is capable of LOVE)? Are you desperately lonely and wish you were blond and beautiful? Do you wish your neighbors were all silly, non-threatening stereotypes? Do you wish the worst thing your kid did was to draw some angry pictures (with a professional style, of course)?If so, have we got a movie for you! Based on the user ratings for this movie, most women agree: We Bought a Zoo is a classic! This is the tale of the aptly-named Benjamin Mee (as in, ""it's all about mee mee mee!""), a supposed adventure-seeking reporter. Though he acknowledges in the beginning of the movie (his lame human interest pitch to the editor) that he is a hack, he expects the viewers to trust that this movie won't be just another one of his forced tearjerkers. One can't help but side with his son, who realizes early on he is simply a pawn in yet another one of his father's stories. And, yes, ultimately, this ""adventure"" (uh, yeah, he bought a zoo. Any problems? Just bring out the checkbook) also ended up being a book and this cheesy movie. The movie is a fantasy not only for women, but also men (well, mostly Benjamin Mee): this guy lives in a magical world where beautiful blond women just can't get enough of him and his son! Beginning of movie: His fridge is jammed packed with lasagna from blond mothers who are filled with lust for him for some reason. Middle of movie: just his arrival to the zoo is enough to make his blond neighbor and her blond niece fall in love with him and his son (""Shut up and bring me a sandwich"" has been the male chauvinist catchphrase for years and Benjamin Mee creates a character (blond, natch) who does literally that!). End of movie: a trio of blond teenagers pass by the guy in his zoo, giggle, and nudge one another. The film ends with the blond pair staring at this guy and his son and gushing about how they prefer humans to animals (this, from zoo- workers, after Benjamin selfishly lets an animal suffer in pain and his son kicks another!). Now we know the hair color of the girl that turned down Benji for prom. However, it is mainly women that rated this movie highly. I can understand the appeal of a rich, brooding guy (check out that scene where iMovies of his dead wife come to life and start dancing around his kitchen to empty ""majestic"" pop!) who loves children, but I can not respect any woman who would relate to these pathetic characters. Scarlett Johannsens' takes a page from the desperate housewife in Jerry Maguire, revealing how desperately lonely she is to a complete stranger who doesn't respect her. Signs of trouble? Like the similarly desperate mother in the beginning of the movie, Scarlett's character shows up with food (pizza, in this case). Her niece is even worse - though Benjamin's son utters nary a word to this person and treats her like crap (rolling his eyes, sneering, telling her that his ""friends"" (who never visited) are more important than her, etc.), she brings him sandwiches (!!!) daily then goes away. After he admits to her that she means nothing to him, she puts up a sign (yes, a real sign) confessing her love for him. You've come a long way.baby.So, yeah, if you enjoy being manipulated by bland/insulting stereotypes and don't necessarily require a story or believable/relatable characters, check out this movie!",We Bought a Zoo
107,spitfire2356,Depressing as whatever,1,28 December 2014,"Well, we watched this in the Christmas holidays as we wanted to see a light family comedy. Worst case of mislabeling and advertising I have seen from IMDb. I should sue! Everybody blamed me for spoiling the evening.The story was the very essence of predictability. Even the movie's weather needed no weatherman to tell you when the clouds will burst or the sun come out. The soppiness was as cheesy as a pizza with all the mozzarella overflowing into your lap.Matt Damon was just unreal: from his bumbling accounting to his pathetic imaginary stories to his kids. Not even Scarlett Johannson relieved the drag, with that irritating smirk which she wore throughout the 2 hour incarceration we suffered.When the fight between father and son finally happened, I could not decide who to hit first - the soppy patronizing dad or the whiny emo son. Rosie saved the family and movie from suicidal thoughts. The inspector Ferris provided the only humor.In these so called family offerings the animals usually save the day. Not this time. The animals real (and imaginary) are depressed from the start and actually die - off stage - not to upset anyone.At the end, one just wants to go to bed, curl up and fart.",We Bought a Zoo

Matt Damon is great, the kids are cute and Scarlett is gorgeous.For me it was a great way to lose myself into a fantasy tale, forgetting everything around me for 2 hours and enjoy the kind of life I always dream for myself, but can never get my hands on. The complications and the solutions might not seem real, but then again it's a family comedy with a touch of fantasy, not a drama or a documentary.

I like these kind of inspiring dramas, but this one was a bit too flawed for me to like it as much as I wanted to. Cameron Crowe does a good job directing and Matt Damon is also great as always. I really enjoyed the story here and even when the film slowed down a bit I still stuck with it. The main problem I have with this movie is it tries to be too much of a Family film when it's already fine the way it is. There are also moments where the film tries to add humor in a situation where it feels very off and just falls flat. The son character in the film really annoyed me. Not just because he constantly whines and is pretty much unlikeable, but also because the actor who portrays him doesn't do a very good job. There's also a romantic subplot between the son and a younger girl who works at the zoo that feels incredibly forced and adds nothing to the film. It could've easily been cut out and the film would've actually been better without it. Despite it's flaws, the film does have a sort of charm to it that makes it hard to dislike. It's a good film that's perfect for viewing with the family.",We Bought a Zoo
114,CaptMTS,We Bought A Zoo is a Heart-Warming Family Film,8,25 December 2011,"We Bought A Zoo highlights the life of a family coping with tragedy that moves to the countryside to take over a rundown zoo. Getting the zoo running provides some funny and touching moments, as the zoo employees and animals serve as entertaining costars.Matt Damon does a solid job as a widow now raising two young kids alone. His character is unable to move forward after his wife's death. Trying to escape her memory, he transplants his family and takes on a crazy challenge for which he has no experience. Matt shows good emotional range, as he learns to adjust to his new challenges.The young actors playing Damon's children do a great job. His daughter is adorable, and she lights up every scene. And, Colin Ford does an excellent job as a troubled teenager, who feels that he has lost both of his parents. Damon and Ford do a wonderful job in the fractured relationship that is central to the film.The supporting characters add warmth to the film. Scarlett Johansen is good as a dedicated zoo keeper, Thomas Haden Church is funny as Damon's concerned older brother, and Elle Fanning is charming as the teenage friend. Several other characters, particularly the zoo inspector, added some fun to the film.Overall, We Bought a Zoo is a heart-warming family film with a good share of both laughs and touching moments. The film takes us through the struggles of several characters to a satisfying resolution. The film is great for all ages and is worth a full-price ticket.",We Bought a Zoo
115,buny101,So much Glurge I now have Diabetes,3,27 December 2011,"The good: Matt Damon, Thomas Hayden Church, Maggie Jones (Rosie), John Higgins. The Bad: The rest of the movie. The Ugly: The possible relationship love angles that might develop with the characters. The movie itself is fairly harmless. Benjamin Mees is recently widowed, and is watching his world fall apart, quits his job and moves his family into an old house in the country that comes with it's own zoo. Of course, there are issues. But, and this is the glurge, no matter how bad it gets, the solution is right around the corner! This probably would have been a better movie if the they had told the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. Instead, they have to make up fake issues to resolve. Oh, I don't doubt there were real issues in the story, but each one seems to be solved not so much by character resolution but by blind luck. It's not that Benjamin couldn't step on a banana peel--it's just that if he does, he lands on a wallet stuffed with cash! Nothing bad ever happens to him without 10 wonderful things of greater magnitude landing at about the same time. After a while, you quit believing in his good luck, and wonder how much of it is contrived. If you start questioning how much of this is not true, then you begin to doubt the whole story. I think if I could have been assured a true story, it would have been better. Instead, I end up doubting so much of the story...and that's a shame. It probably is a wonderful tale, but they had to introduce so many issues that were so easily resolved you just quit trusting the storyteller.The really disturbing part? Ben's love interest is the head zookeeper. Let's see--she's 28, and Ben's son is 14. Dylan (Ben's son) also has a love interest, which is the the zookeepers little sister, who is 12. Hmm. Okay, If Ben and Dylan both get married to their love interest, it would mean that Ben's sister in law is also his daughter in law, and his son is now his brother in law. It will mean that Dylan's sister in law is also his stepmom. Freaky? I think so...",We Bought a Zoo

Wisely, he dares not shovel manure or fall in love with a horse or play the harmonica. He is Matt Damon, actor worthy of nothing shy of a Nobel Peace Prize, for his temperance and triumphant will.

The pair's charming performance (along with a strong supporting cast) makes the somewhat far-fetched story come alive. And a mesmerizing score by Icelandic musician, Jonsi, creates an absorbing ambiance to help it hit all the sweet spots.Some of the relationships are underdeveloped, and the plot is somewhat manipulative and does feel fluffy at times, but sometimes some movies are just heartfelt enough for you to ignore their flaws and willingly buy into the premise.

121,mariajoaou27,Beautiful Family Movie,9,1 April 2013,"We Bought a Zoo is labeled as Drama/Family, but don't let that stop you from watching one of the best movies of 2011. The fact that it is a Family movie doesn't make it too cheesy, too cliché or boring. In fact, the movie's really interesting and the reason why it's labeled as a Family movie is that people of different ages will watch it from different points of view. Younger audiences may see it as an entertaining story about a family who lost a person very close to them and bought a zoo. Older audiences will be able to watch an interesting movie about how to deal with death, grief and how to start over. First of all, the acting is amazing. Matt Damon is very believable, and the actors who play his kids in the movie are brilliant. The little girl is really cute and brings a touch of innocence to this movie. The boy shows how teenagers have a hard time dealing with problems that only adults should have to deal with and the magic of a first love. Love is not the main focus of the movie, which makes it realistic and different from the lovey-dovey movies that have been trendy lately. However, they're important to the storyline and won't feel misplaced or irrelevant when you're watching the movie. This is definitely not one of those films where you feel like a love story was thrown in there to make teenage girls sigh. The animals and landscapes are breathtakingly beautiful, and there's a little bit of comedy to it too, even though it's just in the right dose. It won't make you laugh out loud, but it will certainly make you smile. To sum up, I think this is a movie that's definitely worth watching. It teaches us important lessons, such as that there is time for everything in this life, that we must know how to choose our priorities and that we must live and learn, or else we'll never learn to live. I highly recommend this movie and I hope everyone enjoys it as much as I did.",We Bought a Zoo

Matt Damon plays a lively and adventure loving single dad, with an awesome short but very humorous and noticeable supporting role by Thomas Haden as his brother. Trying to connect with his children after the passing of their mother, he finds all the support from his cute little daughter but a cold shoulder from his son. How the story culminates into him taking the ownership of the Zoo is worth watching. Scarlett, the all beautiful Scarlett plays one of the Zoo Keepers and her chemistry with Matt Damon is very believable.

Great story, directing, acting, production-- all around a refreshing movie in a sea of violent and unpleasant flicks. Someone said ""sadish,"" a rather shallow review of a beautifully executed treatment on the subject of bereavement and renewal. It's a sweet story with comedy, romance, no trashy language, and likable characters. If you love animals, you should see this. If you've experienced loss--either human or animal--you will be touched.

125,walentys,Cameron Crowe wields the camera akin to any of history's greatest painters,8,29 August 2018,"In this latest piece of his he shows his maturity as a director as well as his sense of compassion and truly emotional understanding of humanity.Crowe keeps it real throughout, although moreso in style than in fact. The film is based on a real-life memoir by Benjamin Mee, portrayed by Matt Damon in the film. The facts are not accurate, as the real story happened in Britain whereas the film was Americanized. However the style is real, and by that I mean it is portraying a realistic situation.To briefly summarize the plot, Benjamin Mee's wife has just passed away, and he is looking to restart his life. Right from the beginning we are sympathetic with his situation. He looks at houses and decides to buy one that has a zoo with it that he must agree to maintain, a very large change for him and his two children to make.The film is saturated with varying degrees of emotion in every corner. It ultimately centers on grief and coming to terms with the dead wife/mother. Crowe is not afraid to really dig into the raw feeling of the situation from every character's perspective. Many times we see Benjamin's grief come out, as well as the teenage son dealing with it in his own quiet way, and the very small daughter's naive way of just plainly saying what happened, even to strangers. But there are the good moments too. The zoo comes with a fun, eccentric staff, with the zookeeper being played very convincingly by Scarlett Johansson. This undeniably keeps them all closer together, working together as one big family for a respectable goal: to reopen the zoo to the public after many years of dormancy, and this helps out their situation emotionally by uniting as a family.At the same time it is never absolutely brutal; he masterfully keeps it somehow light and entertaining throughout. This combined with the way it's all shot and portrayed simply makes for a beautiful watch. The cinematography complements the characters' feelings at all times. There are also some gorgeous shots of nature and the zoo by the end of the film. There is a sense of true power, beauty and just plain life to the entire film that makes you want to sit and relax in it, like a warm bath, and never come out, even during the less comfortable parts. This man knows how to make a film.Much of the power can be attributed to Jónsi Þór Birgisson (of Sigur Rós fame) for composing the film's soundtrack. I immediately recognized his distinct voice and knew I'd be in for a treat. His music perfectly meshes with the film's themes: the varying stages of grief, the ups and downs, all with an undertone of the beauty and essence of life and nature that the zoo brings.As a fun bonus the film has a lot of head nods to Crowe's previous works, including a self-reflective scene with the main character looking in the mirror (Vanilla Sky), a long shot of a woman smiling ear to ear (Almost Famous), and the real estate agent was quite reminiscent of Cuba Gooding, Jr.'s character in Jerry Maguire. As a fan of Crowe I was excited to see these minutiae and recognize them as his style.All in all, this is a truly excellent piece of cinema. The only thing that slightly drags it down is that the pacing of the story was perhaps a touch slow at some points. This is only minor and doesn't harm it very much. After a long 6 years since he has made a film at all, Cameron Crowe once again picks up his cinematic paintbrush and delivers to us another fine work that will be viewed and enjoyed worldwide for years to come.",We Bought a Zoo
126,Reverie5,"Good, but not what I expected",5,15 March 2013,"I don't know if this is a spoiler, but for the parents out there thinking this is a good movie for the kids, keep looking. I thought it was a zoo movie myself, but was disappointed when it's all about loving people and only ""liking"" animals. I'm more of a ""I love animals, I like people who love animals"" type of person. There were some beautiful scenes of the animals, but the majority focused on the tiger and bear out of how many species in that zoo. The title of the movie should be ""We Bought a Zoo, Just Because.""I gave it a 5/10 because there was good acting from the Mee family. I didn't like that the movie was choppy at times, and I'm not a big fan of Scarlett Johansson (both her beauty and acting are overrated). I'm sure it's a great movie for other people, but it's not my cup of tea.",We Bought a Zoo

128,marktucker7777,The best ticket to the zoo you could ask for!,10,10 December 2011,"Thank you Cameron Crowe for sharing this amazing story with us. Like you did with Almost Famous, you found an artful and personal way to spin a multi-layered narrative in a visually stunning, yet subtle and approachable fashion. Matt Damon is perfectly cast as the father, securing his rank as the most reliable (and relatable) leading man in Hollywood over the past 15 years. Add to that a throng of amazing child actors, a soundtrack that is still buzzing in my head, and a screenplay which echoes equal parts tenderness, hilarity and truth, and you have my favorite film so far this year. We Bought a Zoo is a movie all audiences will enjoy, though some younger audiences may have to cover their ears for some curse words. Finally, thank you Fox for your series of sneak previews - you wanted the buzz? Well, the buzz is coming! GO SEE THIS MOVIE!",We Bought a Zoo
129,vcastilino,Why not?,8,13 October 2012,"'We bought a Zoo' claims to be based on a true story. It truly is worth watching for the values and ideas it offers. The story is about a man (Benjamin Mee, played by Matt Damon) who has lost his wife and is now left alone to bring up his two children. The teenage son has his own ways of going about and is barely comfortable with the father. The little seven year old daughter is still all awe and happy about what she has than mourn about what she has lost. In an attempt to 'resurrect' his life, Benjamin Mee purchases a new house, far off from the city – only that it has an abandoned zoo attached to it. He takes it upon himself to reopen the zoo with the assistance of the limited staff and of course, without any knowledge of zoo-keeping. Slowly but surely he wins the confidence of the staff – and the animals – and by the end of the movie, all is well. However, at one crucial point when the head of the staff questions Benjamin as to why he purchased this whole thing with absolutely no idea of animals or zoo, he replies, ""Why not?"" Only at the end of the movie, it is shown, how exactly the same reply (or question) opens up a whole new life for him earlier when he meets his would-be wife for the first time. Interestingly the question, 'why not?' is a very revealing one. A sincere look in such a direction throws open so many possibilities which we often – gladly and comfortably – shut out owing to fear, laziness and refusal to move out of our comfort zones. Even in my own life, sometime ago I remember asking back, some of those who always questioned me why I choose to be a Brother and not a Priest. To some I had indeed replied, ""Why not?""

130,Scott-hind,Perfect,10,9 December 2014,"Some films try to play on the emotions, some try to warm the heart. This... Was born for it. Where do I begin with a perfect movie? Let's start with the Mee family. This is Matt Damon at his finest. His role as an absurdly optimistic father desperate to keep his family together an inspiredly understated performance. Damon doesn't try to be clever or brilliant, he just performs in style. His Children... Rosie and Dylan. If Rosie does not completely melt your heart there is something seriously wrong with you. She is adorable. With her big eyes, crooked smile and pure innocence she will melt you instantly. Dylan is a different story. Played by Colin ford, he portrays a dark teen tortured from experience. If this is anything to go by, Colin ford could become one of the finest young actors in the world. His performance is unbelievable! To have you pity such a unbelievable character is something that some seasoned actors are unable to pull off. For a teenager? Fantastic. In a smaller role we have Duncan, Damon brother played by Thomas haden church. Duncan is there mainly for laughs and oozes witty charm. Whilst we're on the subject of wit, you will be hard pressed to find a funnier family flick. Very witty and the laughs come from every member of cast which is very tricky to pull off. Every member of the so called minor characters has well thought out line which are guaranteed to make you chuckle. In short this is a must see, whether 9 or 90. This will make you laugh it may make you cry but it will almost certainly make your day.",We Bought a Zoo
131,tsettles98,I loved it!,10,26 November 2011,"This movie was one hell of a surprise for me! A little while ago, I was really looking forward to it since I'm such a fan of Matt Damon and I adored his most recent movie The Adjustment Bureau. I'm glad this was my first advanced screening.Another thing was that I'm probably one of the first people to see this movie and I'm happy for it! The story was involving and kept me glued to the screen, the little romances between some of the characters were cute and believable, and most of all, THE LITTLE GIRL! She was so cute and an incredible actress for her age!The script was phenomenal and the performances were stellar. The direction was great (expected considering Cameron Crowe, director of acclaimed Jerry Maguire) as well. It made me feel very happy and will most definitely take you out of a dark place if you're in one.Only one gripe was that it was pretty predictable considering the trailer. But, avoid the trailer if you really want to be in love with this movie. I still was! Despite having had seen the trailer.I highly recommend it, great Christmas flick! Full 10/10. No, I wasn't involved in this movie at all. Just got a very lucky advanced screening.",We Bought a Zoo
132,mister-green7,something is missing,4,1 July 2012,"I get the feeling that this film is low on budget (Probably spent all of it on the big stars hehe). I just do not get the 'feel' of the whole zoo. Little or no wider shots. But then again, I don't expect Benjamin to buy the San Diego Zoo or something of similar size. I reckon shots of a wider scale will give viewers a sense of location of the film. It feels like the animals are on a different state altogether, away from Benjamin's residence and that cafe/bar. I wonder if these ideal shots did not make the final cut, meaning they were not shot well enough. Also, you know that something else is missing from this film if you are constantly thinking of Scarlett and nothing else.",We Bought a Zoo

But surprisingly, what disappoints me is in watching the DVD ""extras"" And the real life Benjamin Mee, I(as well as some of those that have read the book I am guessing),was disappointed to see how far from the real story the movie veered. Different country, different life situation with the main characters, different main characters (the female zoo keeper in the movie? Really?) I know the author signed off on this but I have to ask myself. Would his real life story in England not have been every bit as interesting if left intact? They kept in the single dad and death of the mother..Well I guess that would be my only complaint. I am just one to always see if a film is ""based on a true story"" to make sure on the DVD to check that out if provided in a vignette. Watch this movie on it's own without that and you will enjoy it. Just my small gripe.",We Bought a Zoo

Will I re-watch it, not a chance, but I had fun and I think that's the point. Matt did his normal great job, he's not Johnny Depp, but he knows it. Scarlette, well, honestly she just has to stand there and that would be plenty, but she did a fine job of being a really kind of boring character. The Zoo inspector's character was really cliché and wasn't nearly enough of a prick, but I think the over-regulation of the government came through loud enough.

It honestly looked silly and rushed, to me. However, it happened to be on a day when I was working on a book, and I thought, ""Why not ?"". So, I gave it a chance.A widower who is left to raise his two children is determined to move on, peruse his dream, and make a life better for his family. In search of a new house, he finds the perfect one in the country that he is ready to purchase. So? you may ask. Well, this is no normal house as there is a zoo on the property! Even though it failed in the past, he is driven to make it work this time with the faithful staff and his family. Why? Because his little daughter Rosie has that same dream...an adventure. With many side stories, and drama along the way, this family and their new friends give it everything they have. This movie is full of lions and tigers and bears...oh my! Plenty of heart warming lessons and humorous events come along with them.Why I liked it-Well, I am no fan of Scarlett Johannson's but this performance was great! What made it different and so enjoyable was the fact that when a family pulls together, anything can happen. The principles of self determination, hard work, and yes a hint of less government prevail and save the day. This was uplifting, fun and inspiring.The chemistry of the cast was excellent.

Matt Damon was superb, as always! I cant say no more when it comes to Damon. Also, Thomas Haden, who played Damon's brother in the movie, added a nice comedy touch to the movie and made you smile several times. Maggie Elizabeth Jones, who played the daughter, was surprisingly good as well. Am always impressed when I see young actors/actress perform so well.As I read the book, I think it was pretty good, they tried to capture most of what happened and focused on the most important and touching events.

(Spoiler alert - basic plot to follow - no ending revealed) It's the story of a recently widowed father (Matt Damon) who needs to start live over in a new environment to help him recover from the loss of his wife. He has a fourteen-year-old son who is having psychological issues and an adorable seven-year-old daughter. The daughter, played by Maggie Elizabeth Jones, is the best thing about the movie. After searching unsuccessfully for a new urban home, he finds a country home that is perfect, except that it is also a zoo. The zoo is fully staffed (with who else but Scarlett Johansson as the zoo keeper), but is in disrepair. You can guess the rest of the story.

I often find myself rewatching certain scenes from the movie on YouTube. Again, I really cannot fully justify myself for this rating, I just feel like I have a passion for this film deep inside me that I cannot explain, and quite frankly, I am not sure I want to.

There is something about their movies which makes little things important in my life. I have always liked Cameron Crowe & WHY NOT? Jerry Maguire, Almost Famous, Elizabethtown & now this beautiful movie. He does it again & again. Now my story goes like - It was a boring day & I just didn't feel like doing anything & I checked out the movies I downloaded recently and clicked on to WE BOUGHT A ZOO. The movie appears to be a regular family movie-single dad, teenage boy & little sister, nothing new to it. The kids are bit disturbed by the recent death of their mother & father trying to make the things work & in the process he buys a zoo. Now most of us will find it illogical at the beginning that a father buys a zoo just to make his cute little daughter happy. Why would a father do that to his daughter?? Just because she finds others happier...No way man.But as the movie progresses, I realized why not? Why shouldn't we give a chance to the things we are not sure about- just because we are not sure? Of course I m not planning on buying a zoo after watching a flick but there's a lot in everyone's bucket list.All in all the movie gives you hope. Matt Dammon plays his part beautifully, the little girl is too sweet & Elle Fanning is sexy. The lush green appearance & zoo creatures make the visuals lovely & the movie lovable.& the end came a surprise to me, its a true story (tf, he bought a zoo for real).....its insane but I still give it a 9.

And that's what it is. A family film. And that's what you should expect. If you're ready for a feels ride, this movie is for you. We Bought A Zoo does a brilliant job at depicting the story of letting go and moving on which I found quite impressive. I like to use my head while watching a movie and so I basically hate romance and feel movies. But I have to give my exception to this movie, it's brilliantly done in a way that depicts the emotional story of a single father who is trying to raise a family after the departure of his wife. What better way to do that than buy a zoo? Like, why not? However the movie lacks any real plot but manages a great deal of character development and I have to say the acting is superb in this film. In my opinion, you should expect to be watching a family film and nothing else. I mean look at the rating itself, that should say what type of film it is. I highly think that this film is underrated and at least deserves a 7.5.",We Bought a Zoo

147,Darkknight951,My review of the biopic comedy of the meed family and ho they bought their zoo.,8,8 January 2012,I would say that we bought a zoo is one of the better movies from 2011 and a good one to end 2011 it was pretty funny and dramatic Matt Damon's portrayal of Benjamin Mee was a heartfelt one he really brought out the dream that meed had for his zoo and that nothing would get in the way of him achieving it taking care of the animals and reopening a zoo that had been closed for years a hard task or anyone not to mention he stared down a north American grizzly as well and lived to tell the tale. Scarlet Johanson's portrayal of the head zoo keeper was one that was of a headstrong and efficient woman who know's how to take care of animal's and is a little skeptical about meed at first because just like everyone else she can't understand why a man from the city with two kids wants to buy a zoo. The little girl Rosie was the funniest of them all the funniest line said in the movie as said before is when she says to the zoo inspector at the end of the film everyone thinks your a dick but I don't because he was about to sign off on the zoo she also loved the animals and was the main reason that her father bought the zoo at the begging of the movie. Dylan the son of Mee is a teen rebel that does graphic drawings and get's expelled from school at the begging of the film and really misses the mother that's dead now he is a polar opposite of his father and their is a really heated argument between the two of them later in the film but at the end of the film they become closer and he becomes smitten with the zoo keeper's niece at the end of the film. The supporting cast was good as well especially the guy that wanted to kill nit literally the zoo inspector.All and all I have to say that we bought a zoo is a great family film that I recommend taking your kid's to.,We Bought a Zoo

Difficult to let go embark for a fresh start. Out of emotion and desperation for change end up owning a zoo(closed for last two years). The new owner - prior adventurer - accepts the challenge to reconstitute it with a personal motives of distraction from his recent loss. The difficulties, economical bumps and moral principals underline the new circumstances.The fourteen year old son who in constant pain, unable to cry for help express only bitterness towards his father's new venture.The zoo with its thinned staff and uncertain future does not help the cause.In these chaotic grounds the story unfolds and straighten to a happy endings.The star cast unquestionably the best with Matt Damon at the pinnacle as the father and adventurer followed by Scarlett Johansson the dedicated head zoo keeper and refreshing and brilliant addition of Thomas Haden Church as the buttress and adviser to protagonist brother and also not to miss out the youngest Maggie Elizabeth Jones the unbelievably matured eight year daughter with pessimistic son Colin Ford and his love interest very forward Elle Fanning.Matt Damon clearly leading the pact with very idealistic figure venerable to human error.The brilliant cinematography with every scene either starting or ending with picturesqueness of animals and nature giving depth to human emotions unknowingly. Music consistent and grasping the nature of an outcome.Dialogues very well written intelligent, charming and unbelievably knowledgeable with the best pick-up line ever "" Why would an amazing women like you will even talk to someone like me "" and philosophical addition as ""twenty seconds of insane courage, just twenty seconds of embarrassing bravery"" at instant of questionable actions are dully noted.Finally the great comeback of Cameron Crowe after almost five years with exceptional movies such as Vanilla Skies, Almost Famous and Jerry Maguire under his belt and this definitely did not fall below expectation.

149,izibellz,HOW is this movie averaging such a high rating???,1,10 October 2012,"This is absolute crap. First of all, for a movie that has everything from tigers to kangaroos to porcupines, it sure is boring. Secondly, what the heck kind of widower with small children thinks it's a great idea to face off with a bear and wander into a tiger enclosure because, God forbid, the tiger's chilling on the roof of his tiger house, and - to paraphrase Matt Damon's character, whose name I don't even remember - if the tiger attacks him, AT LEAST IT WILL CLIMB DOWN FROM THE ROOF FIRST? Jesus Christ, you've got to be KIDDING me!!! WAY TO LOOK AFTER YOUR MOTHERLESS CHILDREN, AS*H*LE!!! And why can't the tiger hang around on his roof if he wants to be there? IF YOU DON'T WANT THE TIGER ON THE ROOF, DON'T GIVE THE TIGER A LARGE, FLAT, WARM ROCK THAT'S EASILY ACCESSIBLE AS A ROOF!!! O_O Also, I love how the guy buys a zoo because ""it makes his very young daughter happy"" and conveniently ignores the fact that (1) of course a small child is going to like a zoo, this doesn't mean it's a good idea to buy one, and that (2) his teenage son is NOT happy that his dad's wasting all their money on a run-down zoo out in the middle of nowhere. Finally, he should probably invest in some employees who know what they're doing. This is a ZOO. There are WILD ANIMALS in the enclosures. It is STUPID to run into a lion enclosure while a fellow employee ""distracts"" the lion. If Mr. Lion's feeling peckish, he'll IGNORE the crazy person yelling and waving at him, without a second thought, and EAT the other person who's walked into his enclosure, has turned his back on him, and probably pongs of fear all the way to Timbuktu. Not to mention that Scarlett Johansson's character leaves an UNLOCKED crate of snakes just - you know - sitting there, in a place where the main guy's son or little daughter can (AND DO!) just stumble upon it and open it out of curiosity.

Matt Damon puts up a strong performance as Benjamin Mee and I loved the way he had shown different shades of emotions as he struggled to raise his kids alone with the memories of his late wife.

152,winston9109,Despite Some Obvious Problems - The Movie Was Good,7,1 November 2012,"There were many times during ""We Bought a Zoo"" I felt like I was seeing an unfinished movie. Nevertheless, it was a movie worth watching all the way through. (Its not entirely just about the little girl being cute.)The Bad: Transition shots. They were too long, for instance a car driving by would be on the screen for several seconds. These things add up especially if its a family movie with restless kids. The Profanity. Not because it was a family movie - even the most sheltered children surely have been exposed to the words in this film, and even as a family film, it still holds a duty to be realistic. However a lot of the swears I felt were simply unnecessary for there scenes, and thus took precedence. The OK: Acting: Matt Damon is a good actor. A good actor - sometimes great (most notably his earliest in Good Will Hunting.) He doesn't exactly carry this film, but he at least shines above his female opposite. Scarlett Johansson, in my opinion, shouldn't act. Lord knows why she was chosen in Nolan's The Prestige, the one weak spot in that film. The Ending: If you view the ending as an epilogue, it works. A little nostalgia, a little reflection on the road they've traveled. Otherwise its just a little weird. A large keystone for the film was Damon getting over the pain. Maybe - doing what he did - symbolized this, but could it have been done better by just stopping with the Zoo? I think so. The Good: Cinematography: The use of the sun in the film, especially those drifting shots where the daughter is playing with the birds and the sun shines above her, were remarkable. I've been to that part of California and the lighting, framing and film stock was effective enough that I felt like I was back. The Icelandic Soundtrack (mostly Sigur Ros) also complimented these shots very well. Story line: The one area of recycling Hollywood doesn't fail at is recycling story lines. This story is something fresh and original - much needed, and calls upon important family issues such as sacrifice, letting go, and opening up. Overall: Had they gone over this project a few more times (with me in the cutting room, of course ;) it could have been upwards of a 9. It had a strong foundation. But it felt like too rough of a cut. Sometimes the camera angles were choppy, sometimes they were languid and beautiful. Sometimes the script was sentimental and smooth, sometimes it was just awkward. It was nonetheless a family film worth watching and enjoying.

Of course the film is a bit too young for me at 50+/- so I expected a light film and few upsetting moments to the characters.Yes there are moral themes but, they couldn't offend anyone, again, it is this type of film; no conflict and a youthful cast that leads it to qualify for a ""Family Film"".I knew what to expect going in and was not disappointed in any way.If you happen to be a mature adult and count your pennies, maybe try another film, though it is a nice film.",We Bought a Zoo

While it may not be extraordinary acting, it does have meaning and different life lessons you can learn. The movie is centered around a family, a father who recently lost his wife. As well features his two kids whom he moves out to an abandoned zoo. This movie shows overcoming tragedy, adoslescent behaviour and the trials of being apart of a family. Also for kids there's many cute animals. This movie can help anyone suffering from a loss of a family member to someone who forgot about what it's like to pursue their dreams.",We Bought a Zoo
155,venkatarathnaiah,Adventure of life of zoo,7,24 August 2018,First of all kudos to the cast they portraied every character in a perfect manner. something i felt matt convention through character has distugised which i had observed in emotional scenes.The little girl was so cute and well acted might this could be helped her for her acting skills through young sheldon.The movie of the story plotted coherent to the jungle life.It was nuance of watching a different one.Would helped me to muse of about zoo.Watching on these got few ideas where i want to spend some time in zoo for natural air and need to spend precise time with natural beauties. nowadays hord peoples are almost hectic on social networking sites or some more public things. But for real they are all missing nature's life there we can see how much of life was thriving with zero envy.Thanks for the director for coming with a natural movie,We Bought a Zoo
156,karen_ga,Much more than I was expecting,8,5 November 2012,"I went into this film with little hope. Having seen the trailers, I was expecting a lot of farm jokes and lots of sight gags. What a pleasant surprise I got in return for my low expectations. As the film opens, Benjamin Mee is hustling his kids out the door to school. 7 year old Rosie is a happy little girl, her 14 year old brother Dylan is ...well, not. As we get into the movie, we realize that this family recently lost their wife and mother. Needing to get out of the town where everyplace reminds Benjamin of time spent with his wife, he and Rosie go house-hunting. They find the PERFECT house, only to find that a zoo comes with it. Rosie is immediately in love with the animals and the place, and Benjamin signs the paperwork to take possession. The family moves into the house, Dylan being dragged along unwillingly by everyone else. Kelly, the zoo-keeper is the first person who challenges Benjamin over his treatment and relationship with Dylan, saying he's giving him too much space. Meanwhile, 13 (or 14) year old Lily has set her heart on Benjamin. With Lily, Dylan is able to be himself and we slowly see the child inside who is trying to make sense of his life now. Meanwhile, the zoo must be renovated to pass inspection, and reopen to be a money-making venture. The supporting cast is amazing, from Thomas Haden Church to Patrick Fugit and Elle Fanning is stunning as Lily, and plays her with just the right touch of naiveté.Lots of ups and downs later, the Zoo reopens with hundreds of people waiting to get in on opening day. Benjamin and Kelly, and Dylan and Lily start their own relationships and the movie ends on a friendly note. It's heartwarming, tear-jerking and will take you on an emotional roller coaster ride, but it's worth every minute. You will walk away from this movie with gladness in your heart. To find, at the end, that it is all a true story makes it that much more rewarding. Stick through the credits to see the real Mee family getting the original zoo up and running.",We Bought a Zoo
157,Racetrip,Worst movie of the century,1,10 April 2012,"I feel so manipulated after watching this movie, they push all the right buttons to make you cry just to kick you in the teeth later. As much as I tried to hold back the tears I couldn't, but that doesn't mean this movie is a family movie at all. While watching the movie I thought I might have made a mistake regarding the rating, I thought it was rated PG (nothing to worry about language wise) but damn was I wrong - it was rated PG, although it should have been rated PG13. I cannot explain how surprised I was when I heard the little innocent little girl in the movie say the word ""dick"" out very loud... what the what! And while no mother need fear that the day will never come when a little boy will use the word ""cunt"" or ""pussy"" in a PG movie, many seem to have gotten so used to hearing women and teenage girls using the ""d"" word that it's now time to have 7 year old girls say it. The movie was totally ruined after this and my wife and I walked out of the theater. I don't even care how great Matt Demon was acting, or any of the other actors for that matter - this is the kind of movie you should be ashamed to buy, as ashamed as if you were buying a porno movie!

159,cubes007,Positivity,8,12 May 2012,"I ended up enjoying this movie much more than I thought I would. When a movie is titled, ""We Bought a Zoo"", it lowers one's expectations. However, I found this movie watchable and substantive.Matt Damon really carries this movie. Himself appearing visibly aged, having lost whatever youthful shine that he used to glimmer with for the last decade or so, Damon really personifies a man who struggles with having lost something integral to who he is, as a widower. His character jumps into a self-proclaimed adventure headfirst, and he pays the price. However, Damon does a nice job of wearing that pain on his face, particularly in scenes where he struggles to connect with his unhappy teenage son.Although this movie was definitely formulaic, it really felt like a journey of substance. The daughter of Damon's character is a scene-stealer, an adorable little sprite. The end of the journey had an epic feel to it, and it was genuinely satisfying to watch.",We Bought a Zoo
160,irishguy122,Life is a jungle...,8,20 May 2012,"Based on a true story, We Bought a Zoo is a simple story of a man who's life is falling apart following the death of his wife, and unable to effectively help any of the people in his own life, he risks everything by buying a zoo, and in reopening this zoo and saving it from permanent closure, he himself begins rebuilding his own life. Utterly heart warming and charming throughout, the characters struggle against time and financial limitations to rebuild the zoo and ultimately form a close knit family.Matt Damon serves up a delightful and honest performance as Benjamin Mee, and constantly steals every scene. His insecure but determined character makes us root for his success, and this is a refreshing performance after his numerous action roles.Other honorable mentions go to Maggie Elizabeth Jones as the adorable Rosie Mee and Thomas Haden Church as the well-meaning older brother in an all round great cast performance. One to see!!!",We Bought a Zoo

I know that it is an ""Americanized"" version of the real story, but that doesn't matter. Matt Damon is such a good, all around versatile actor, and this part doesn't hurt his credit one bit. I will say that not using Thomas Haden Church more was a lost opportunity, and I don't think Scarlett Johanssen brought anything special, but she was just fine. Every moment is enjoyable and great happiness.Great family movie, and those are far few between these days.I hope every see this movie and enjoy.",We Bought a Zoo
162,alienator345,An Inspiring Family Film,8,3 January 2012,"This holiday season brought audiences several great movie options to see. Out of all of them, earlier today I believe I shave seen my favorite. Not War Horse, Sherlock Holmes, Tintin, Mission Impossible, or Alvin and the Chipmunks. The winner is We Bought a Zoo. Now to be fair, I haven't seen Mission Impossible 4, but despite all the great things I've heard about it, I don't think it will strike a chord with me like We Bought a Zoo did. It is such an inspirational story with a powerful message. And it gets quite emotional in several spots. Now I'm not an emotional person typically and I've never actually cried in a movie, but this movie almost broke me. My mom, who cries a lot during movies, certainly was crying in a few spots, so its a tearjerker.We Bought a Zoo is based on a true story. Specifically the memoir of Benjamin Mee, which is his story of, as you can guess, him buying a Zoo. There are some noticeable differences in the movie and in the real life story as I have looked at it afterwards, but those changes were adapted only after the approval of Benjamin Mee himself, who still owns and lives in the Zoo he purchased. In the movie, Benjamin, played by Matt Damon, is going through some serious family troubles. Namely, his wife the he dearly loved has just recently passed away which has made life for his young family really difficult emotionally, especially for him and his teenage son. Seeking to get away from life a bit, he decides that he wants to move and falls in love with a certain country house some 9 miles outside town. Before purchasing it, he quickly learns that it is a somewhat broken down and struggling Zoo. Despite his background as an adventurous person, he has no knowledge of Zoology. However, he decides to take on the task to help renovate and re-open the struggling Zoo. With that said, yes it is a story about a Zoo, but telling a story of how a man renovated a Zoo is not the point of this movie. It is a story of courage. A story about moving forward in life despite the difficult times. Lastly it's a story about maintaining good relationships with your family and those around you. There are a few taglines in the movie that really just jumped out at me that I will remember and use in my own personal life to help me.Now We Bought a Zoo isn't without its flaws. There are times when I was slightly bored with it and times where it seemed to move slow. I wasn't a big fan of some of the acting by several of the more minor characters. But overall it was a very well done film. The strongest part of the movie was certainly Matt Damon. He has become one of my favorite actors recently and in this he gives a very good performance. If the Academy Awards were up to me, I would give him the Oscar for best Actor after this performance. I hope he at least gets nominated because he deserves it. The cast around him was also superb for the most part. Scarlett Johansson did a great job in the lead female performance, that being Kelly the lead Zookeeper. Elle Fanning did a great job acting as one of the younger crew members of the Zoo. Lastly, Benjamin's two kids ages 14 and 7, were done quite well. His 14 year old son Dylan, played by Colin Ford, even looked and acted like a young Matt Damon. The score in this movie was absolutely beautiful. It really made the movie. In my opinion it is one of the best scores of the year. The cinematography was also great. I especially loved the animal shots in the movie.In conclusion, We Bought a Zoo is no action-packed, high suspense adventure movie. If you are looking for that, go check out Mission Impossible or Sherlock Holmes. What it is is an inspirational family movie that I really enjoyed. I highly recommend you check it out. I give it an 8 out of 10.",We Bought a Zoo

166,ryanvance,"Not a great family movie, full of heart but does not quite deliver",5,13 November 2012,"There are two reasons this film did not work for me. First off, for a movie that surely looks to be marketed to kids under 12, this one really misses the mark. There is a fair amount of curse words which is totally inappropriate, plus the easter bunny comment was not necessary either. The film was very slow and much of the dialog was over the head of the viewers under 12.Second, this was a very typical Hollywood, feel good, cliché production. The believability factor was totally out of wack. Here goes-How could an unemployed person with two kids afford to buy a zoo in Southern California? Who is paying for the staff and upkeep of the animals? Why would the property listing not include a mention of the zoo? They list if the property has ceiling fans, but not a wild animal park? How could someone finance the complete restoration of the park? remember he is unemployed. Why would his late wife put the secret financial documents in a sweatshirt pocket? When snakes escape they do not congregate in the driveway.The setting of the film was breathtaking, I wish they would have had a better shot of the whole property. Visually the film felt disconnected, the house, the park, the restaurant, all of the buildings. This just amplified the unbelievability rating for me.Matt Damon did a fine job with the screenplay but I don't think he was the right actor for the part. The girl was adorable, his son's character was typical bad attitude teen turned dad's best bud. Overall it was somewhat boring, not an animal movie, not a kids movie. Kind of a love story maybe?",We Bought a Zoo
167,liveweaver,"http://readreels.blogspot.in/ : This is a Adventure, one that keeps you smiling throughout.",8,1 April 2012,"We Bought A Zoo directed by Cameron Crowe is a true feel good movie.You do not only feel nicely sedated by its sheer loveliness long after it ends, but you actually feel good about all of its characters while its playing unlike some recent films like The Descendants and 50/50 where you constantly feel bad for their leads as they face their tragedies that is why this movie feels so fresh and full of joy. You may shed some tears though this adventure but you just can't stop smiling ear to ear when its playing.The film stars Matt Damon as Benjamin Mee, having a hard time as his wife died 6 months back.Now a single father of a boy of fourteen Dylan and a girl of seven Rosie(she's so cute that your jaw will hurt watching her). Frustrated with all the sympathy he's still getting Ben sorry!! Benjamin (Ben was his dad) quits his job and then decides to move to a zoo after his son gets expelled.That's when this lovely adventure starts.In order to complete this adventure Benjamin have to find some closure, repair his relationship with his son and above all bring the sun back into his and their live.I loved the film for its immense and constant likability.A success on all fronts great acting, lovely story, flawless direction, a great background score and a happy adventure.

168,andrew-32-51147,"A sensitive and serene exploration of grief, loss and adventure",10,8 January 2012,"I thought this was a very honest and sensitive exploration of a fathers relationship with his children after the tragedy of his wife's death. It has moments of sheer trepidation and intense awestruck emotion as the children and the man himself try and grieve in separate ways.The boys love interest, while banal at times, was very enjoyable. However given the strength of this subplot i found the animals to take the passenger seat as Benjamin didn't seem to buy the zoo because of his own connection with the animals but rather due to his daughter, which made his attempts to keep the zoo rather unconvincing as I could only see his passion towards his wife under the guise of buying a zoo.I was glad that Scarlett Johansson was not a priority in this film and instead the family was the core focus of the film.

This character was able to live life to aspire for an amazing cause by improving his family's lives, and making a journey out of being able to make a living. I found all the character's believable and interesting and high quality (for anyone saying the little girl was annoying, I think she kept things entertaining).

The cinematography was a delight and I often felt like I was watching a BBC episode of Planet Earth but with human drama and comedy. Best of both genres!Matt Damon is excellent as usual. An actor who can talk about anything and have you totally captivated (He should run for congress like in The Adjustment Bureau). So was the rest of the cast, especially the kids.

175,tjfrye-970-903996,Happy happy happy happy happy happy happy...lots and lots of happy.,7,8 January 2012,"At one point all guys have usually had a girlfriend that's begged us to take her to a certain movie. Sometimes it's something that makes you want to hide, like say Twilight? Or you get that instance where she wants you to take her to typical cutsie wootsie date movie full of happiness, and rays of sunshine gleaming down on the faces of the innocent, and at first you buckle down and just say ""OK alright not too bad"", or maybe you even heard it was an OK movie. Yeah, well We Bought a Zoo is that second kind of movie I mentioned. It's not really something you would want to go see on your own, but it's something that's not really painful to take a girlfriend to. In fact I (a slightly morbid adolescent who's film class projects are influenced by often dark themes) took a liking to this film. The characters were fairly well developed, I didn't find myself hating any of the characters that I was supposed to like. At the bare minimum you can call this movie decent. ---What did I like?--- Well like I said I really did like the characters. Out of all the characters I liked most, I would have to say I liked Dylan the most out of all. He's a true exhibition of how you can make a non-likable character actually likable through the story arc. I felt they really portrayed his emotions in a sequence that an actual teenager would go through them in the situation of moving after a parents death. Loss, remorse, anger, physically portraying the anger in a manifestation (i.e. his dark artworks of decapitations and monsters), depression, and then finally acceptance...although the arguments that he has with Matt Damon that is supposed to make him come around was quite backwards. I felt it should have been Benjamin coming to comfort Dylan, rather than Dylan being sorry and accepting his dad. The way it was done just made it feel like Benjiman was unable to understand his son even after their little fight. ---What did I hate?--- Although I loved the characters I really have to admit...I kinda hate the main character. Matt Damon does OK portraying him I guess, but it's just the way that the character is written. Instead of being a man overcoming uncertain odds, he's just some guy who relies on a never ending supply of optimism to get him through...and let me be honest this guy is optimistic, so optimistic in fact that it's scary. Sometimes you just want to slap him over the head and make him feel a different emotion other than pure optimism induced happiness. Some of you might argue he does have those scenes where he's thinking about his wife and how he's crying...but no you're wrong. He might be sad in that scene, but right afterwords he's back to being some happy optimistic guy with a spring in his step. Other than that I didn't hate much...OH! no actually there is one more thing. It was so annoying how Matt Damon called everyone ""Man"". He calls his son that in a huge emotional argument when it really would have been better to say ""Son"" or ""Dylan"" or something a father really would say, but he doesn't stop there, he call's his own love interest Kelly ""Man"" at one point too; kinda awkward but I digress. Over all this is a fairly good movie that's worth being enslaved by your girlfriend to take you too. Oh and what about the plot? I'm not going to review that because it's just straight forward inspirational movie plot. You know ""Guy does something that puts him in a world with small odds, guy fights through all his obstacles, tons of false climaxes to keep you on your toes, and then finally a mooshy climax that makes your heart collapse from sheer adorability."" 7/10 Worth a watch, or a red box rental -FryeGuy",We Bought a Zoo

Amazing that all that emotion, all that passion and adventure was real. And so much came out of Benjamin Mee simply buying a zoo; reconnection with his son, acceptance of his wife's death learning to move on.

Getting along the zoo staff and learning to take care of animals will be an adventurous and refreshing journey for the family.This skillfully realized Hollywood product has all the right ingredients for a decent movie: an ensemble of niceable characters (cute kids & attractive adults), a proved plot style (overcoming a challenge as a team, here, putting the zoo back in shape), a moving topic in background (mourning), and a touch of humor (the villain inspector & the animals).In this time of changes, relationships between people will evolve. We see some conflicts but also new forms of complicity. Characters develop according to some predictable clichés, and the movie does not take risks.

The zoo is kind of in the background, the main focus is on the relationships between the characters. I had a few tears during some of the more emotional scenes.My only issue with the movie is the language used. Given that this is a PG family movie about a zoo, does the swearing really need to be in the movie?

I've seenmany movies the last couple of years, but this was one of the only ones that I believe was actually a waste of time. I still think it's supposed to be parody.

What a waste!! Even the story line was a bit lacking and I thought too serious for kids. Not at all the lighthearted, fun family film it was portrayed as in the trailer.",We Bought a Zoo

I don't know why I waited this long to watch the film. Actually I do! I was thinking ""Oh, here is another boring film based on an everyday story that somehow got a mention at the Oscars, a gimmick to sell DVDs""; so I thought. How dumb of me! This is an ordinary story but woven into very extra-ordinary circumstances! The writing is so stupendously effective that I want to bow down to the script-writer. The levity and seriousness is so superbly handled I am awed. The filmmakers are heavenly, and the actors made watching this for me feel like a little piece of magic happening in real life, like I was watching my own family up on screen. I am so beyond impressed that occasional Gems like this one, do make it into print. Thank you so much for making a beautiful, beautiful piece of cinema. I will be buying my DVD copy with great pride.",We Bought a Zoo

I was blown away from start to finish, Matt Damon was brilliant, as well as all the cast, I cant fault this film, it is going to go down as one of my top tens of all time! If you want to go through the roller-coaster of emotions then this is the film to watch, I was laughing, crying and cringing! Cringing at the fantastic scenes when the dangerous animals were feet away from actors. Crying at the touching scenes, which were filmed brilliantly.

Cameron Crowe has done just that with WE BOUGHT A ZOO. This is a beautiful movie, full of life - truthfully acted, beautifully shot and lovingly directed. I expected to cry (which I did, many times) but I didn't know that it would also be so funny with levity coming just when you need it. Matt Damon was brilliant as the heartbroken but hopeful father. And my only gripe about Thomas Haden Church is that there wasn't more of him! The kids were all brilliant -- not an ounce of self-consciousness to their acting, which is rare when it comes to child actors. And the final scene alone is worth the price of admission. Anyone willing to open his or her heart will fall in love with this movie like I did. Kudos to all involved.",We Bought a Zoo
192,zemorena,big disappointment,1,29 January 2012,"What a disappointment of a movie! This family is making a big change in their life by moving in the countryside and taking a zoo business on their hands. It's supposed to change them, to enlighten them, to provide some sort of inner development but it didn't seem to do so. There were no big revelations. At the end of the movie the father was still living in the past, still not moving on. There was no connection between those people and the animals, no connection between nature and man. The soundtrack would have been OK if there were a deepness to the story, but there wasn't. Scarlett Johannson - it seems her only job in this movie was to smile at Damon. She doesn't have any smart lines. And all the other people from the zoo, they were supposed to be eccentric misfits but it all stopped at clothing and accessories. No character, no friendships! Not to mention the whole cheesiness and clichés.. at every two minutes there's a voice shouting 'dead wife, dead wife, dead wife'. We got it the first time! Will you please develop a movie on that?",We Bought a Zoo

I honestly have no idea what the writers were thinking when they came up with this piece of crap they tried to pass off as a movie.Okay, first of all, it had humor that was obviously meant for young kids, so why the hell would they put in swears like sh*t, assh*le, and b*tch?! I have been trying to figure out what was going through their mind when those dumbasses made that decision, but I can't even think of a reason! What age group did they think that movie was gonna be for?! Jesus... Hollywood these days...Secondly, there was really only one funny part. The daughter was buried in animals, and the Dad was like, ""What are you, a Chilean minor?"" I'll admit that part was really funny, but nothing else was funny. If you're looking for a laugh riot, do not, by any means, see this movie.Lastly, my ass that movie was rated PG!! There were swears that you can't even say on TV-MA, they said the easter bunny wasn't real, and that stupid d*ck son was drawing gory emo pictures every two seconds. Whoever rated this movie.... good luck, buddy.So, in conclusion, this movie goes at the bottom of my list, right next to The Dilemma.",We Bought a Zoo

Far better. What i feel is that the movie does not deserve a rating more than 6.5 on IMDb (When we compare all the other movies which got a rating of 7 or near about). In that sense the movie is clearly overrated but still a one time watch. Its a feel good movie which barely makes you feel 'good'. I am going with a very very generous rating of 6 on 10 for this one",We Bought a Zoo
195,aebars,"Pleasant, but predictable",5,16 June 2017,"Benjamin Mee (Matt Damon) is a former adventure journalist whose family - consisting of obligatory cute, precocious 7-year-old daughter Rosie (Maggie Elizabth Jones) and obligatory moody, confrontational teenage son Dylan (Colin Ford) - has been in a funk ever since his perfect, pure-as-the-driven snow wife Katherine died. Deciding that a move to a new house is the means of snapping them out of it, Mee discovers a property that seems perfect, only to then be informed that it is in fact a zoo - a dilapidated zoo that is forecasted to close unless someone purchases and refurbishes it. Initially discouraged, he elects to buy the property anyway after he observes what a shine Rosie takes to it. Will the family be able to refurbish the zoo in time for its grand reopening? Will Benjamin and Dylan reconcile with each other? Will Benjamin enter a new romantic relationship with the attractive divorced female zookeeper (Scarlett Johansson) who runs the zoo?Gee, what do you think?'We Bought a Zoo' is a fluffy, amiable, inoffensive film, but there's no getting around the fact that it's incredibly, incredibly schematic. There's no plot development that you can't see coming from a mile away, no dilemma that isn't solved by a convenient contrivance, and little dialogue that isn't trite. (At one point, prior to the move, when Rosie can't sleep due to the next-door neighbors having a party, she declares: ""Their happy's too loud.""). Hell, there's even a ""villain"" in the form of Walter Ferris (John Michael Higgins), a snooty, ""evil"" zoo inspector who swaggers around, looking down his nose at Benjamin, and threatens to close the zoo unless every square inch of it complies with draconian regulations. (Walter Ferris joins the likes of Principal Edward Rooney from 'Ferris Bueller's Day Off', and Walter Peck from 'Ghostbusters', as an example of a character who is framed as a ""villain"" simply by virtue of doing his damn job!).If it's a rainy afternoon, you're feeling depressed, and you just want some generic, no-frills, Hollywood feel-good comfort food, then 'We Bought a Zoo' actually works quite well. I'll be the first to say that there is, in fact, nothing inherently wrong with such a movie. But if you're in any way jaded or cynical, or in any way a connoisseur, then 'We Bought a Zoo' is liable to make you roll your eyes hard.",We Bought a Zoo
196,soumer-mariem,"surprisingly moving, humanly touching and incredibly honest",7,28 March 2012,"I went into this film with low expectations, honestly I thought: what could be special about it? it's just a story about a zoo. well I was pleasantly surprised. As a matter of fact, it is ,in no case, just a pointless film about a guy who buys a zoo. It is a movie about life, about family, and human connections. it is about a father who is attempting to start over after his wife passed away, a father who is doing everything he could to keep his family together after an unfortunate tragedy set them apart. it is about a brave man who saves the animals and ends up being saved by them in return. it is a magnificent film featuring great performances from both Matt Damon and Scarlett Johansson and led by such a wonderful soundtrack. what really and instantly draw me in in this film is its undeniable honesty. I was watching it and thinking : that could happen to anyone and when he/she least expects it. It's a journey anyone should experience , because by the end of the day, we come to the realization that we are all looking for the same thing that is true joy. isn't that what life is all about ? finding true joy ?",We Bought a Zoo

Hollywood always pushes the envelope of their artistic license, blurring the lines between the factual and fictional elements of movies ""based on a true story"" and this was no exception. Nevertheless, it was very enjoyable and had memorable characters and memorable moments. Definitely one to watch again. Only real down side for me was the amount of ""adult language"" sprinkled throughout this family film.Okay, I get it: it's Hollywood and it's the new millennium, but why the need to embellish the script with so many ""colorful expletives?"" I'm no saint and I let my own four-letter words fly every now and then, but when a movie is billed as a family flick, you gotta at least give parents a fair chance. Here's a clue Hollywood: When your movies are edited and played on T.V.--they're still just as good. In this movie, the language was just unnecessary and added nothing to it.

I did not understand Damon's character, or the ""motley crew"" of zoo personnel. I get that he is mourning his deceased spouse, but what would motivate him to purchase this zoo?

That's downright stupid).This movie was a huge disappointment and was totally unrealistic. It was obvious that the ""true story"" was severely manipulated to create this film.It is supposed to be a family film, but I would not waste my time watching this with a family when we could actually be watching something worthwhile.

Well, it's not. I have watched this film numerous times over in a row simply because I suggest it everywhere I go for a movie night. It suits everyone.We Bought a Zoo deals with loss and rediscovering, it has simple yet effective humour and just generally has you smiling, and if you put yourself into the perspective of Matt Damon's character, Benjamin Mee, then definitely crying. There isn't much that can go wrong with such a great storyline and great actors; everything is so warm but not the kind of warm that makes you wince from the corniness.Like I said, this movie is always a hit and I always suggest it. Not only is it a true story but it will teach you lessons to live by and at the same time have you either laughing, clenching your heart or covering your eyes. This film is incredible and deserves more recognition and praise. Do yourself a favour and watch this movie!",We Bought a Zoo

After about 5 minutes, I saw what kind of movie this was and was disappointed in the IMDb community. Don't get me wrong, This is a good family movie to take the kids, But it is a straightforward Hollywood feel good movie and thats it.You can call where everything is going in the first 5 minutes. Everything wrong is presented to you, and everything is fixed by the end. No hiccups. Bloody drawing? The child must be so troubled. You can guess what kind of drawing they were in the end. No Love interest, Guess what? that changes to. No money? O what do you know, Your dead wife left you 80k, isn't that nice?It literally goes out of its way to make it feel so good. Snakes escape the night before and they all gather around the front of the house. The little girl talks like a 20 year old for the most part, and has perfect handwriting, yet her J is backwards.

There was no need for this vulgarity. Both my kids turned to see my reaction when this happened. I was not pleased, being as this is supposed to be a family film. The rest of the movie was ruined for me as I spent it on edge waiting for more vulgarity instead of being immersed in the experience of the film.

The emotions that he brings out in some of the scenes like his frustration when he finds it difficult to maintain the zoo, his conflicts with his son makes us feel so genuine. All the other actors have done justice to their roles. The surprise package would be Ms.Jones, who plays the character of Rosie. She is just a breath of fresh air in the movie. Probably this is the 1st time I realized while watching the movie is the importance of background music.

The troubled, misunderstood teenage boy. The starry-eyed little girl. The flashbacks of mom. Some of the conversations regarding mom before she died, etc. The snakes in the crate was poorly executed IMHO. Ever seen a snake escape from a cage? They don't generally go lay out on the front lawn. Let alone hundreds of snakes. They all just happened to be lounging on the front lawn? Kind of silly. Production values were high, as would be expected in a high-budget film. But overall it just didn't flip my switch. Which is very unfortunate, as I really wanted to like this film.",We Bought a Zoo

Adorable little Rose Mee, the animals, Peacocks will definitely put a smile on your face. Matt Damon & rest of the cast have done their parts well. The reason you should go watch this movie or why I liked it is because we find very few simple stories these days. A fictional novelty like Inception and an outer life experience in Avatar surely are the films which capture your imagination in this age of cinema.But there is always a story with normal family struggles, life, humans, animals (in this case) and a simplicity. Keeping it simple yet charming I feel is a very tough tough task and this one does both well. There might be technical imperfections or talks over Crowe's previous works but I feel every movie is a different experience and this one leaves you with a smile. Cliché for a family dramas but we all love it and director strikes a right cord in holiday season.I read a review where one said ""I am glad we came"".",We Bought a Zoo

Come on guys - give us parents a LITTLE warning, huh? Otherwise it was a cute heart-warming story that appealed to young and old. We loved that it was a true story; didn't find that out 'til the end but. It's amazing the healing qualities of humanity, hard work, fresh circumstances and a new perspective. I really loved how the sad energy was put to a new use and was so completely turned around. Just wonderful.",We Bought a Zoo
214,caitlin-t-98,Heart Warming movie for the whole family,10,9 January 2012,"We Bought A Zoo is an enjoyable family movie that will have both the kids and adults laughing and crying. Not only will you fall in love with the characters, you'll fall in love with the animals and the zoo just like the Mee family did. You will also walk away thinking about 20 Seconds of Insane Courage, a little phrase that has helped the Mee family in lots of situations for example; girls.After the tragic death of Katherine Mee, the Mee family turned upside down. Dylan Mee (played by Colin Ford) started hating the world and started drawing pictures of what he thought was the underworld, Benjamin Mee (played by Matt Damon) was struggling to get the kids ready for school and was hating the pity and help from people because of his wife's death so much so that he quit his job, and Rosie Mee (played by Maggie Elizabeth Jones) missed her mum a lot and at 7 shes already doing a lot to help her dad out. Thats when Benjamin decided to change everything, new house, new schools, new job. When he found the perfect house he got a bit frustrated when he was told the house was a little complicated, until he heard the lion roar. When Rosie found out it was a zoo she got all excited and that when Benjamin new this was it, this was the perfect start to something new.Benjamin's brother, Duncun Mee (played by Thomas Haden Church) helped him out a lot financial wise and around the zoo along with the zoo keepers but even then there was a lot of work to be done. And even threw all that stress, Benjamin gives love a second chance with co-worker Kelly Foster (played by Scarlett Johansson) who shows she good with kids when Benjamin went off on a drive to release his anger and frustration. Kelly's cousin, Lily Miska (played by Elle Fanning) also showed a liking to Dylan Mee and, even threw all his darkness, managed to squeeze sunlight and happiness out of him.Overall, I believe We Bought A Zoo was a great movie that I would love to see again and probably will. The cast was great and lovable, the animals were cute and the plot was amazing. I totally recommend it! I guarantee that if you don't love the cast and characters, you'll love the animals though I still believe everyone will fall in love with Rosie.",We Bought a Zoo
215,jmeshearer,Simple and Hopeful.,8,23 December 2011,"This film, starring Matt Damon, was unequivocally everything I had hoped it would be. Upon viewing the trailer while waiting to watch The Muppets, there were tears in my eyes and my heart skipped a beat as I remembered I wasn't watching the film itself, just the preview. The film came out yesterday and to my luck, my mother invited me to go and see it with her this evening. I was thrilled to see that the music throughout the film was performed by a favorite Icelandic musician, Jónsi, with a perfect selection of ""Holocene"" from Bon Iver's new album. It was little details such as these that kept me appreciating the film from start to finish.The plot may have been at times predictable but they were predictions you wanted to happen; conflict you wanted to be resolved and rain you wish would stop. Coming into the theater already a Matt Damon fan I was interested to see how he was going to fill the widowed father role. A few things a noticed; Matt does look older, he is still as handsome as ever, and he should stick with a shorter haircut. Aside from my personal opinion, I think anyone leaving the theater could agree he played the roll wonderfully. The warmhearted character of adorable Maggie Elizabeth Jones, melted my heart every time she was on the screen. Her character, ""Rosie"" was the seven year old whose dreams came true; her Dad moved them to a zoo. My favorite scene is when the Realtor tells Matt Damon's character, ""Benjamin"" that the house they wanted to buy was also a zoo. As Benjamin stood there dumbfounded, Rosie Jumped up and down as any seven year old would shouting ""Yay!"". Seriously, the cutest thing ever.If the cast didn't win you over the animals did. Tigers, lions, bears, snakes, monkeys, owls, otters, peacocks, etc. The list goes on and on. Each personality portrayed in a relatable way as if you were on the team helping run the zoo itself.If you and your family are wanting to go see a movie this holiday season, go and see We Bought A Zoo. It is the perfect film to tug at your heart strings, leave you with tears in your eyes, and hope in your heart.",We Bought a Zoo

PG means PARENTAL GUIDANCE, It's good to give parental guidance on an issue like ""mom died"" and ""why did the tiger go to heaven"" things that shouldn't be in a ""G"" movie. To make matters worse, they OUT THE EASTER BUNNY!! Seriously not the conversation I was wanting to have on the drive home. The movie would have been just as good without all of the swearing and easter bunny outing. Without it, this would have definitely made it into our DVD library. Hope the Hollywood a holes that decide on these things think it was worth all the money they'll lose when parents don't buy their stinkin' DVD.

221,supkaty,About a family whose mother passes away and buys a zoo. The family learns to love each other more and more.,10,31 December 2011,"This movie was just excellent.It had many lessons to teach to people. one lesson was you only need 20 seconds of courage which was the one lesson that stood out to me. Also, I thought the acting was outstanding especially from Colin Ford, Dylan Mee, . Colin does a great job in the movie of how he is in so much pain of his mother passing by getting into trouble and overall just being mean to everyone. His father,played by Matt Damon,decided the family needed a change by moving which helped out Dylan and Rosie get away from all of the remembrances of their mother. Dylan(Colin) shows us very well how much he is hating his lifestyle of his father buying a zoo. Colin and Matt(father and son) fight all the time with each other and Colin just does an amazing job as well as Matt of showing us that they pretty much hate each other. Basically, Colin Ford does an amazing job acting in this movie which makes me want to watch it over and over again.",We Bought a Zoo
222,tmistretta-261-533397,"Good movie, but not for kids",7,9 January 2012,"The movie and storyline itself were good. My only complaint is it appears to be a kid friendly movie from the previews, but is not. Aside from all the profanity, that is not needed and does not add a thing...there is one line in the movie that was a completely stupid move on their part. Benjamin Mee says to his son ""there is a 7 year old girl in the next room who still believes in the Easter bunny""....HELLO?! There was a 7 year old girl next to me (my daughter) as well as an entire theater of kids who still did too, until coming to see that movie. Nice move. Why don't you just tell them there's no Santa Claus while you're at it. Other than that, I do recommend this movie for adults.",We Bought a Zoo
223,cparrish14,Family Friendly and Funny,10,9 January 2012,"I went and saw WBAZ with my sister and it was the best movie to see with her. It was a family friendly movie and anyone of any age would benefit from seeing this movie. All of the actors and actresses in the movie were dead on and they all played there parts perfectly. My favorite of them all was the heart-throb, Colin Ford. He was very mysterious and extremely Attractive in this movie.****************SPOILER************************I found it funny that he never noticed Elle fanning's character having a crush on him. What I took away from this movie was ""All you need is 20 seconds and insane courage, and I promise you something great will come of it."" I also found out that the question to ask isn't why? Its Why not? Everyone should live there lives freely and worry free without asking why they should do something. Overall I give this movie a 100% and I would recommend this to all of my friends and family.*****************SPOILER*************************",We Bought a Zoo
224,ilovecolinford,first movie that made me so emotional,10,13 January 2012,"For Christmas, my family and i went to watch this move.

225,zoemani,I love we bought a zoo,10,18 January 2012,"We Bought A Zoo is the touching story about a father Benjamin Mee (Matt Damon) and his two children Rosie (Maggie Elizabeth Jones) and Dylan (Colin Ford), as they try to move on from the tragic death of their mother. The Mee family wanted to start fresh. A new school, a new house, a new place. They came across this house, which in Benjamin's eyes, was 'perfect', but this was no ordinary home, it was in fact the Rosemoor Wildlife Park, which had been struggling to run. Dylan wasn't all excited about the idea of living in a zoo, but the rest of his family looked at it as the start of a new adventure. A week after moving in, it seemed easy to run, they faced struggles, but that didn't matter to Benjamin, because he was willing to do what it takes to save the zoo, no matter how much money he spends, they were he's new family, and a family will stick together till the end, no regrets. Altogether, they manage to update the zoo, passed the test, and were able to open it. We Bought A Zoo is the most inspirational movie I've ever seen. It caught my attention from the beginning till the end. I laughed, I cried, and I fell in love (with Colin). This movie suits any age, and I would rate it 6/5 stars! The cast were amazing, and they all did a fantastic job. Cameron Crowe is a great director, and turned a book, into the most popular movie ever! I've seen this movie heaps of times, and I'll NEVER regret it! Some people don't like watching movies at the cinemas more than once, but We Bought A Zoo is so worth it!!!!",We Bought a Zoo
226,jkrules003,Will It Move You?,9,20 March 2012,"The answer to the query posed in the title is, in effect, what should determine whether you decide to watch this film. Cameron Crowe's latest work is what one would label as a classic 'feel-good' movie, or perhaps even a 'tearjerker'; the intent of the film, then, is primarily to explore the relationships between cast members and, in the end, resolve them in a manner fit for the genre. We Bought A Zoo accomplishes this with very little missteps along the way, in part due to Matt Damon's ability to convincingly play a widowed father undergoing an emotional crisis of sorts, and in part because of the phenomenal music utilized in this film.The film's title effectively summarizes the thrust of the plot: an urban family, in need of change, relocates to a pristinely beautiful rural area (and house) that just so happens to be a zoo. The family dynamic is the foundation on which this movie is built: Damon's connection with his son and daughter, and his former wife, drives much, if not all, of the tale. In conjunction, and perhaps equally important, is the dynamic between said family and the zoo caretakers; Scarlett Johansson and others play the residents in charge of animal operations, and do so admirably. There is no true 'antagonist' here, although physical and psychological obstacles are present, and overcome.The soundtrack accompanying Crowe's film is, simply put, enthralling. Jonsi, lead guitarist and vocalist of Sigur Ros, has put together some of his best work, not simply within the movie's context, but also outside it; this is music that easily stands on its own. Whether one feels the soundtrack -- and the movie's affecting moments -- to be persuasive or compelling will, of course, depend and fluctuate from person to person; as a film enthusiast and a veteran of many movies of this type, I can say that this one was a good, if not great, entry in the genre. Thus, the answer to my initial self-imposed question is a definitive YES; I can only hope that it also moves you.",We Bought a Zoo
227,shorty654321,Great Movie!,9,2 May 2012,"In my opinion, this movie is great! It shows how it is not always easy to venture out after losing a loved one. Buying the zoo was probably a great thing for that family because not only was their house getting small, but Dylan was having a hard time in school and he needed to get away from the city life. This movie is a great example of how hard it can be to be a single parent with two kids. Dylan also isn't very nice to his father, which shows how relationships aren't always great between parents and children. Dylan and Lily have an awkward relationship also which portrays how teenagers aren't always good under pressure. Overall this movie is by far a terrific movie that i wouldn't mind watching over and over again!",We Bought a Zoo
228,angelique127,movie kills children's beliefs do not watch with children,1,9 May 2012,"We found out the hard way that this movie was not suitable for children. We watched it two nights ago with my daughter and it was the biggest mistake I could have made. The father makes reference to the daughter believing in the Easter bunny. It had nothing to do with the plot at all and could have been deleted or a warning to parents. This crushed my daughter's beliefs. She no longer believes in anything and cried. I know that all children will find out eventually, but a movie shouldn't do it for you without warning. All previews looked family oriented and I'm highly disappointed. If I had known, I might had watched without her or not at all. It gets an F for crushing her world. It was fairly good until then.",We Bought a Zoo
229,yapat2,A regular favorite!,10,17 January 2021,"For ten years, I just love this story of persevering, overcoming, and the reward of walking forward without having all the answers.",We Bought a Zoo
230,tk4101,cute movie but a little disappointed,3,21 May 2012,"The movie started out sweet. The little girl is adorable, but why the curse words. You ruined it for children. You would think that a zoo movie would be perfect to watch with your kids until the kid in the movie starts cursing. Really? YOU COULDN'T DO WITHOUT THOSE NASTY WORDS. Did you think a few curse words were going to add to the excitement. I'm sorry, in my home we don't use that kind of language and I'm sorry, I wouldn't find the rating before I watched it. Thanks but no thanks that totally ruined it for me. I hope in the future, you think of us parents who still prefer to keep our children innocent. Beware parents with children.",We Bought a Zoo
231,slohrba,Better movie than expected!,9,16 June 2012,"I rented this movie for a Friday night movie date with my husband. From the advertisements, I wasn't sure what to expect other than some family issues, sadness, and some cheesy moments. What we experienced was an emotional roller coaster ride. The movie actually demonstrated how different people cope with a loved one's death quite accurately - everyone reacts differently. Having recently lost a good friend to breast cancer at the young age of 33, and since I have two young children of my own, I'm sure that pulled at my heartstrings in a way that it might not in other people. But I thought the actors & actresses did a great job in this movie, and I was truly excited to see if the zoo would succeed or not in the end. This movie is totally worth watching, and I would watch it again.",We Bought a Zoo
232,cheunghiulam04,Good,10,3 July 2012,"This is a good movie which the actors bring out their feelings naturally. In this movie, I like Dylan and Lily's relationship. They are both teenagers and they fell in love with each other. I love it because most of the boys or girls wish to have a girlfriend or boyfriend. ;) Colin Ford as Dylan Mee is so handsome, I just can't stop starring at him in the movie. Also, Kelly Foster and Benjamin Mee's relationship is also complicated. Benjamin lost his wife but he met another girl in the zoo. Kelly Foster is a really beautiful girl and she is attracted by Benjamin. Every movie has a plot and this got one too, the zoo has a financial problem, but they went over it. This film is suitable for any ages. Enjoy this movie!! And hope this comment can give you guys a good information of this movie.^_^",We Bought a Zoo
233,et1821,Very touched by the movie,10,12 November 2014,"I would love to thank all involved in creating this movie which is highly sensitive in the approach and presentation, where we can see ourselves ""attached"" to many events and even make me cry.... which I mainly do not.

Have we become nothing but brainless mush waiting to be transformed into sycophant authoritarian, Big Government loving libtards? Just waiting to be influenced by left-wing propaganda. Sappy enviro-crappy nonsense and lame love story puke. God Help us if this is what passes as entertainment for the masses.

237,ben-todd-260-503931,really quite something,2,10 March 2015,"It made me want to cry. Cry magnificent tears just like the tiger whose pain shot through this film so viscerally and reverberated off the fortresses of acting genius that are Scarlett Johansson and Matt Damon. The little girl's innocent charm most ignited the very core of my paternal instinct with a joy of great radiance. What surpassed even the acting was the plot. Based on a true story, this cinematic tour de force was compellingly raw, honest and refreshingly devoid of the clichés and implausible devices that so many use to drive them forward or pull themselves together.Then there was the script, oh my, what a thing. It has inspired 'zoo face' a new term for an expression that my wife and I share which can only be brought on by the sparkling brilliance of the dialogue in this film. Sometimes it can be difficult to submit to that which is truly sublime and it looks like your grimacing whilst simultaneously inhaling faeces, however, in reality all the time the core of your being is being slowly filled with the caramel nectar of joy.",We Bought a Zoo
238,atts1,Great Family Movie,7,27 November 2011,"We Bought a Zoo... There are not enough movies that teach what it means to care. Matt Damon and cast turn in a very good performance in this light, but powerful movie about reestablishing a famous zoo that had been shut done but functioning for the last two years. My wife and I went to the movie on a whim due to our love of Cameron Crowe, and were not disappointed. Crowe always has a focus of building the characters up in a playful way (Jerry Maguire and Almost Famous). The 7 year old daughter played by Maggie Elizabeth Jones, and the older brother played by Thomas Hayden Church were well done. They added the right comic humor to kept the movie uplifted. In addition, it was good to see Patrick Fugit again, he was so great in Almost Famous. The movie, based on a true story of a widower buying a zoo, at times tilted toward being overly dramatic, but never tipped. Overall WE BOUGHT A ZOO is not a Oscar worthy movie, but a movie that will have you leaving the theater feeling good.",We Bought a Zoo

240,njangid,"A fresh breather, Wow!",10,4 April 2012,"After a long time, a movie with the freshness of story which is heart warming and original. Matt Damon, Scarlet Johansson..in fact all of the actors have done wonderfully well, of course under the genius guidance of Director Cameron Crowe. The story has interwoven the emotions Benjumin's family, who is looking for a fresh start from their loss of mother and wife, with those of team of animal loving persons who are tending to a lost zoo, and to a certain extent with those of lovely animals who are part of the zoo. After the initial hiccups, all of them get together to bring the zoo to life again. Well, you got to watch the movie to feel the pulse of heart poundings of the main characters in the story. Go for it!",We Bought a Zoo
241,dawntrespass,Not as rosy as they make out,5,3 May 2017,It may be a good film but the zoo this is based on had a previous owner and the new owners wanted vacant possession of the attached properties that the zoo staff stayed in. Lets just say that the new owner wouldn't have bought the zoo if the staff didn't move out and the old owner allegedly was threatening to blackmail them to moving out and kill the animals if the sale fell through. Please be aware this 'intrerpretation' is made as rosy as possible.,We Bought a Zoo
242,wbhendrix-1,"Beautiful & Touching, Crowe does it again.",9,27 November 2011,"Cameron Crowe never fails to deliver hart warming drama-comedies that make you laugh, cry and keep you on the edge of your seat for duration of his films. For me personally, I never seem to agree with Crowe's casting taste (Matt Damon and Scarlett Johansson never do much for me) but Cameron has a way with actors and a true vision for his story. He always seems to know exactly who can capture his characters and ultimately draw out your emotions that he's tugging at. In We Bought a Zoo, there is a bit of a slow start and at one point I was worried Cameron had lowered his voice to appeal to a larger audience to please producers and critics alike (after his Critically-bombed but personal all time fav, Elizabethtown). But let me tell you, pay your dues with the first half of this film because the second half will take you on a mesmerizing cinematic adventure you'll be heartbroken for more. Cameron ventures into a new family drama without compromising his voice, music taste or quality film making. And if you are still not a huge CC fan, the animals are sure to win you over. Their beautiful and natural moments on screen are as breath taking as they are tear-jerking.Spend an amazing two hours with this film and there won't be a person in your household that won't agree that this film is one to remember. From a fan and living-room-critic, I give it two thumbs up :)",We Bought a Zoo
