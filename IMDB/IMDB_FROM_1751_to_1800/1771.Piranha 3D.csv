0,TheLittleSongbird,Messy...,3,21 September 2011,"Just for the record I was fully prepared for a fun, silly movie like the original Piranha. But apart from some good moments I found this movie messy and rather pointless too.There are some good things. The big attack is gory and one of the few scenes in the film I'd call tense, the special effects look great and well-incorporated here and the scenery is really beautiful. Elizabeth Shue is very good in her role, and Richard Dreyfuss's cameo was really quite neat.So what was wrong? Sadly, pretty much everything else. The script was mostly very weak and cheesy, the music verged on gimmicky and obvious and the story is dull with little surprises. The piranhas are effectively designed, but they're not really that threatening until the big attack and a lot of scenes suffer from a lack of tension and excitement. The editing could've been more tight and less sloppy, while the direction lacks focus and the female nudity does get too much after a while.The acting apart from Shue and Dreyfuss's cameo is not that great in all honesty, Christopher Lloyd overdoes it badly to the point you can't keep a straight face whenever he appears and Jerry O'Connell is so obnoxious you feel nothing but irritation for him. The actors are not helped by the fact the characters are written in a very shallow manner, while I disliked the stupid and unnecessary ""it's not over yet"" ending. All in all, a messy and pointless film. 3/10 Bethany Cox",Piranha 3D
1,Leofwine_draca,An all-time monster movie favourite,10,9 October 2016,"I'm a massive fan of the 'underwater menace' B-movie. From old-time 'classics' like HUMANOIDS FROM THE DEEP through to modern-day disasters like AQUANOIDS, I make a point of sitting through every one I can track down. Having loved Joe Dante's original PIRANHA, it was inevitable that I went to the cinema to see this remake. Even better, it was in 3D, so there's plenty of stuff popping out of the screen as the story progresses (although not quite as gimmicky as the 3D seen in MY BLOODY VALENTINE 3D and THE FINAL DESTINATION 3D, the effects are great here).This film is a blast. The movie succeeds admirably because it never tries to offer anything else than B-movie thrills, namely nudity and gore. The scant running time is absolutely packed to the brim with naked women and people being destroyed by piranha in increasingly gory ways. Director Alexandre Aja, who handled another fine remake (THE HILLS HAVE EYES), knows exactly how to deliver a fun, thrill-packed film and he does his job admirably. This is one of the most hands-down entertaining creature features I've seen in a while and the kind of film you think they don't make anymore.The ensemble cast is rather impressive, although most of the familiar faces contribute little more than extended cameos while the youthful likes of Steven McQueen (Steve's grandson), Jessica Szohr, and Adam Scott take the major roles. BACK TO THE FUTURE's Elizabeth Shue is good value as the resourceful sheriff, though, and I liked the majority of the young stars, with the exception of Jessica Szohr. Elsewhere, we get Ving Rhames playing a customary hard-ass, Jerry O'Connell hilarious as a sleazy porn director, Christopher Lloyd good fun as the exposition-heavy doctor, Kelly Brook beating off supporting porn starlets as the hottest woman in a bikini (and out of it), Richard Dreyfuss contributing a sly cameo, Eli Roth in a great cameo, plus brief turns from Dina Meyer and Ricardo Chavira as divers.The first half of the movie builds the suspense with some murky underwater shenanigans and a tense, terrifying showdown in an underwater cave system. The second half lets rip as partying teenagers fall foul of the piranha (who number in their thousands and make short work of the partygoers). The gore is pretty extreme but done in a humorous way that doesn't leave a bad taste in your mouth. Let's just say body parts are removed and flesh stripped from the bone as the fish go to work. The CGI effects aren't spectacular, but a lot of effort has gone into them and I ended up enjoying them a lot. PIRANHA 3D is no classic but I'll look forward to watching it again once it comes out to buy.",Piranha 3D
2,SnoopyStyle,well made sexploitation horror,6,25 March 2015,"It's spring break at Lake Victoria and kids have gathered for their annual drunken party. Deputy Fallon (Ving Rhames) and Sheriff Julie Forester (Elisabeth Shue) are trying to keep the peace. Kelly (Jessica Szohr) has come home from college and Jake Forester (Steven R. McQueen) is still pinning for her. Derrick Jones (Jerry O'Connell) hires him as a guide for his video shoot. He has to babysit his siblings and recent earthquakes have released a school of prehistoric piranhas. Julie takes out a group of scientists to investigate the tremors. Jake ditches the kids and Kelly comes along for the shoot.It's fun to have Richard Dreyfuss killed off in a fish horror movie right off the bat. It sets the right campy tone. It's sexploitation horror. It knows exactly what it is and doesn't try to be more. It's got blood, gore and hot bods. The acting isn't too silly even with Jerry O'Connell. There are some good actors in this functional horror.",Piranha 3D
3,claudio_carvalho,"A Rip-off of Jaws with Lots of Clichés, Boobs, Piranhas and Blood",4,8 February 2011,"A geological failure on the bottom of Lake Victoria opens a breach and releases prehistoric flesh-eaters piranhas. Meanwhile, it is the Lake Victoria spring party where teenagers arrive in to drink beer and booze, get sun tanning, swim in the lake and have sex. When the local Sheriff Julie Forester (Elisabeth Shue) and her Deputy Fallon (Ving Rhames) discover how danger the lake is, they unsuccessfully try to avoid the tourists to jump into the water to protect them. After saving many teenagers, Sheriff Forester learns that her family is trapped in a yacht that is stranded in the reef and heads in a boat with an acquaintance to rescue her children and family.""Piranha"" is a rip-off of ""Jaws"" with lots of clichés, boobs, piranhas and blood. This forgettable film has good names in the cast, including a cameo of Richard Dreyufuss, but the greatest attractions are the girls in the bikinis and the gore and gruesome special effects. There are funny moments, like the piranha eating Derrick Jones' penis; or Jake and Kelly being pulled through the reef in a ""very clever"" way to escape from the piranhas and the explosion of the yacht; or the clever Novak asking the youngster to leave the water during the attack of the piranhas. My vote is four.Title (Brazil): ""Piranha""",Piranha 3D
4,nogodnomasters,Girls gone wild plus fish,10,10 February 2018,"The opening scene with Richard Dreyfuss (Jaws) fishing was worth an added star. He gets sucked into a computer generated whirlpool. The plot is simple: fish eat people. Rather than create mutated or altered fish we have prehistoric fish which gives us an underwater cavern scene which could have used some more imagination. The fish, who lived in the cavern should have been blind, a point missed by the producer who was too busy recruiting porn stars, Ashlynn Brooke, Gianna Michaels, and Riley Steele for cameos. Yes there is nudity and lots of it, including underwater full frontal and a severed male organ being devoured by our prehistoric fish. The boat used in the movie has the name ""Barracuda."" The actors can't help the bad script. There is plenty of blood and devoured bodies, especially the bottom half. Lots of underwater, fish eye views. In this case the campy re-make is better than the original, which doesn't take much.",Piranha 3D
5,kosmasp,Coming at you,7,24 October 2010,"Piranha movies are kinda crazy. They are actually completely ridiculous. But still, if you let yourself, this one puts the fun back in ... Piranha. And breasts (nudity) and everything else you might expect from a movie of that caliber/category. There is not a big story behind this all (just enough to move the action and party scenes moving along). With great actors turning up (the intro might just be one the funniest nods to another movie) and some very gory moments.So this isn't for everyone. Who'd have thought? A movie about Piranhas (I'm guessing you know those fish are not vegetarians) divides the audience. Of course it does. But if you really rent this movie, without knowing what you get yourself into, than shame on you (and not the movie).But congrats to Mr. Aja, who seems to finally found his calling. Mindless fun/gory movies. The reason he said, he wanted to do movies in America, was because he could up the ante in the gore department. And he didn't have a problem to do that. And this might be the most enjoyable movie he did since his french debut High Tension.",Piranha 3D
6,gavin6942,"Bad Movie, But I Am Fairly Sure That Was The Goal",6,15 March 2011,"A group -- a very large group -- of college kids are having spring break at Lake Havisu in Arizona (called Lake Victoria in the film). A small earthquake unleashes an underwater tunnel where thousands of hungry piranhas wait.This film marks the third time that director Alexandre Aja has directed a horror film remake. He previously directed ""The Hills Have Eyes"" (2006) and ""Mirrors"" (2008), also remakes of earlier horror films. I want to say this disappoints me, because Aja has some of the best talent in the business today, but frankly he makes remakes worth watching. ""Hills"" may have trumped the original.Having ten times the budget of a SyFy film, with only a marginally better outcome. The effects are still pretty cheesy in most scenes, leading me to believe the money went to the decent cast, with the two best actors (Christopher Lloyd and Richard Dreyfuss) only having a few scant minutes on screen.The cast? Elisabeth Shue (looking good for her age), Jerry O'Connell (usually annoying but works in this film), Ving Rhames (who we do not see nearly enough of in the theater these days), and Eli Roth as a guy with a thousand one-liners about wet breasts. In fact, the film as a whole has more bare women than piranhas.Empire gave the film three out of five stars, saying ""Remember the film you hoped 'Snakes on a Plane' would be –- this is it! By any sane cinematic standards, meretricious trash ... but thrown at you with such good-humored glee that it's hard to resist."" I agree. This is the cheese I wanted from ""Snakes"", but unlike that film, it is not a pile of dog excrement.And did you hear? There is a sequel on the way... I almost suspect it will be better than this one.",Piranha 3D
7,jboothmillard,Piranha 3D,6,21 August 2010,"When I saw the trailer and poster for this film, I knew it was going to be borrowing themes and cashing in on the success of Jaws, but I didn't know it was a remake. The original film was released three years after Jaws from debuting Gremlins director Joe Dante, and it had a sequel three years from also debuting Terminator director James Cameron, anyway, this was the new one from the producer of 300 and director Alexandre Aja (The Hills Have Eyes). Basically the film opens with Matt Boyd (Jaw's Richard Dreyfuss) fishing on Lake Victoria and with the simple dropping of a beer bottle causing the underwater earth to crack open, releasing a race of pre-historic man-eating piranha fish, and he of course is their first victim. Annual Spring Break has arrived, which means thousands of visitors come to the lake to party, drink, dance and enjoy the great sunshine, and Novak (Adam Scott) is ignoring his order to stay home and babysit his little brother and sister. His mother meanwhile, Sheriff Julie Forester (Leaving Las Vegas's Elisabeth Shue) and her team of water experts have discovered the nasty truth about the quake and the victim's body, and they take a caught fish to aquatic expert Mr. Goodman (Christopher Lloyd). He identifies the caught ""specimin"" is indeed a deadly thought-extinct piranha, they have survived from cannibalism, and he explains their attack tactic. While they try and get to the lake to close it to keep everyone safe, Novak has joined brash dick-head porn filmmaker Derrick Jones (Scream 2's Jerry O'Connell) as he makes his new film with stars Danni (one-time Britain's Got Talent judge, the gorgeous Kelly Brook) and Crystal (real porn actress Riley Steele). Soon enough chaos does indeed set in as the piranhas start attacking all the people swimming in the lake, and Novak and the gang also get caught in the blood fest, and only Julie and Deputy Fallon (a slightly brief Ving Rhames) can rescue them. In the end, after a few dozen people have been killed and half-eaten by these monsters, Novak and his love interest Kelly (Jessica Szohr) seem to stop the last bunch with a gas explosion which knocks them out, but the final shock of ""babies"" may bring us a sequel. Look out for cameo appearances by Eli Roth as Wet T-Shirt Host who has his head crushed by two boats, and porn actresses Ashlynn Brooke as Cheerleader who gets sliced by a rushing boat line, and Gianna Michaels as Parasailing Girl who goes into the water and comes out with no legs, only entrails. The most memorable sequences, brought out with the 3D gimmick, are obviously the nod to Jaws opening, Brook and Steele's naked underwater ballet-like swimming, all victims having limbs taken off with plenty of blood and guts following, and the Pièce De Résistance, some silicone breast implants floating followed by O'Connell's bitten off penis with two piranhas fighting over it, and it's spat back out. The B-movie concept with casting choices and particular ideas does do the film favours, the critics say the film didn't go over-the-top enough, I agree O'Connell does, Lloyd as the mad scientist is good, there are some well done in-jokes and an overall grisly feel, but for me the both gruesome and comedic gory effects were what keep the film going, a dark but fun horror thriller. Good!",Piranha 3D
8,Woodyanders,Entertainingly mindless soft-core horror splatter schlock,8,2 February 2012,"A bunch of ferocious carnivorous prehistoric fish are unleashed following a minor earthquake so they can ravenously devour assorted rowdy'n'obnoxious kids celebrating spring break in the small town of Lake Victoria. Yep, that's about it for the admittedly skimpy plot, but what this gloriously tasteless, senseless, and offensive big budget Grade B junk lacks in substance (plenty, to be brutally honest) it more than compensates for in sheer giddy chutzpah, excessive in-your-face graphic gore (it's a real nasty treat to watch scores of boisterous party hearty collegiate hell-raisers get savagely munched in the flick's major grand scale splatter set piece), cheerfully crude'n'vulgar humor (watch out for that severed penis and those floating silicone implants!), and a bunch of hot babes happily baring their tasty bodies in the name of leering lowbrow exploitation (two luscious nymphs swimming together underwater to classical music provides the definite arousing highlight in this particular department).Director Alexandre Aja and writers Josh Stolberg and Peter Goldfinger deserve kudos for their audacious eschewing of good taste and restraint in favor of go-for-broke energetic and unapologetic sleazoid fun'n'thrills. The neatly varied cast has a ball with the trashy material, with especially stand-out work from Elisabeth Shue as the feisty Sheriff Julie Forester, Jerry O'Connell as slimy porn filmmaker Derrick Jones, Adam Scott as the heroic Novak, Jessica Szohr as the sweet Kelly, Steve R. McQueen as nice kid Jake, Ving Rhames as the hard-nosed Deputy Fallon, and Kelly Brook as foxy hardcore cinema starlet Danni. (Speaking of hardcore cinema starlets, yep, Riley Steele has a sizable role as the yummy Crystal while both Ashlynn Brooke and Gianna Michaels appear briefly in smaller parts.) Popping up in cool bits are Christopher Lloyd as flaky fish expert Mr. Goodman, Eli Roth as a smarmy wet t-shirt contest host, and, in an amusing homage to ""Jaws,"" Richard Dreyfuss as a fisherman who has the honor of being the first person to bite it (pun intended). John R. Leonetti's polished widescreen cinematography gives the movie an impressive slick look while Michael Wandmacher's spirited score and the pulsating rock soundtrack keep things buzzing. Art this wild'n'woolly outing certainly ain't, but for those seeking tons of over-the-top cartoonish contemporary grindhouse popcorn fun this baby is sure to fly your proverbial kite.",Piranha 3D
9,BA_Harrison,Aja puts the fun back into horror.,9,25 November 2010,"After five years of humourless 'torture porn' nonsense and 'gritty' remakes of 70s/80s exploitation classics, it seems to me that many horror fans have forgotten how to have a good time: Piranha 3D, a veritable smörgåsbord of tongue-in-cheek, in-your-face, gory 3D delights and gratuitous nudity, has garnered some pretty disparaging comments from viewers who have berated the film for being 'trashy', 'cheesy' and 'dumb'. Helloooo people... surely that's the point!!!Alexandre Aja's re-imagining of Joe Dante's low budget Jaws cash-in is a deliberate return to the good old days when all you needed to enjoy yourself was a lake full of man-eating piranha, loads of graphic gore, and a few hundred nubile teens, all potential fish food for the fanged critters from the deep; if people can't see why that is fun, then I truly feel sorry for them. As far as I am concerned, one of life's greatest pleasures is to be able to switch off the brain from time to time and just revel in an excess of boobs and blood, in this case all presented with the advantage of an extra dimension. Call me easy to please, but I had a blast.From the amusing opening, which sees Richard Dreyfuss parodying his famous role from killer fish classic Jaws, to the predictable final scare immediately before the closing credits, Piranha is hugely entertaining, low-brow, popcorn horror. Whether it be Eli Roth hosting a wet tee-shirt competition before having his head crushed, Jessica Szohr puking in 3D, Kelly Brook performing a prolonged naked underwater ballet with adult star Riley Steele (given the size of the lungs on those girls, staying down for so long must've been easy), Elisabeth Shue in uniform, Ving Rhames being a total bad-ass once again, the endless splattery effects of Nicotero and Berger, Jerry O'Connell as sleazy porn producer Derrick Jones, or Christopher Lloyd hamming it up as fish expert Mr. Goodman, I loved every single trashy, cheesy, dumb minute of this film.",Piranha 3D
10,paul_haakonsen,"Just gory enough, but....",5,7 October 2010,"Well, where to start on this movie? I think I will start off with the gore. There is enough blood and gore in this remake of the classic ""Piranha"" movie to keep most of us gorehounds interested. And this is, without a doubt, because of the effects created by Gregory Nicotero, he is the king of special FX make-up. His work here really carried this movie.In my opinion there was way too much ridiculous non-sense scenes about having to show off naked breasts. I am sure that would sit well with younger audiences, but for us movie lovers, this is a slap in the face. We watch this movie to recapture the essence of the old ""Piranha"" movie and see what the director improved on and made different in the new version. We didn't watch this movie to see a softcore adult movie. It was tasteless and pointless, especially because of the excessive amount of time used on those shots.The story was fairly good, easy to follow, and surprisingly enough, no plot twists. Basically your standard ""whoops, we released some vicious bestial killers on the world, now we must kill them"" type of movie here.As for stupid scenes, besides the naked breasts scenes, well what was up with shooting shotguns at random into the water to kill fish? What sane person would do that? And the water rushing into the sinking boat seemed to go on break or pause when the sheriff (Elizabeth Shue) had to get her family across the connecting wire between the boats, that made me laugh. It was so bad. And also, who would say ""they took my penis!"" after having been mauled from the waist down by piranha? Stupid, stupid, stupid...In overall, I was thoroughly entertained by the movie, because it had just the right amount of thrills and gore to keep me happy. The story was secondary in the case here, because it was all something that was seen before.As for the cast and acting, well people did good enough jobs with their roles. However, Ving Rhames had very little on-screen time and didn't get to act out his potential in this movie. The starting scene with Richard Dreyfuss, that was one of the cooler scenes and bolder choices of his that I have seen in a long, long time. Hats off to Dreyfuss for that.Now, I will not reveal the ending, but WOW! That was one of the crappiest typical Hollywood endings in a long time. It was ridiculous. I don't really get the hype there has been about this movie, because it was not all that impressive. Sure, nice 3D effects, but that doesn't really impress me that much. I watch movies for the entertainment value, the acting and the story, not just solely because the movie makers can now start to utilize 3D technology better. Sheesh!",Piranha 3D
11,Quinoa1984,this is inexcusable. I mean that as a compliment,7,21 August 2010,"Piranha 3D isn't a very good movie. It's an awesomely bad movie, at least up to a point. It does take itself at times seriously as a horror movie. This is where it kind of goes wrong; if anything Piranha 3D - a remake of a ripoff of Jaws - should be so trashy that Oscar should pop out of a trash-can and riff on the piranha chewing on the castrated penis underwater. But it is trashy enough to be a lot of fun at the movies, and, yes, particularly in 3D. Since it is such a gimmick that is not really altered by a whole lot since its inception in the 1950's (maybe slightly, but in theory not so much), it has a certain appeal when it comes to movies that don't have scruples about their quality. So, for example, Alexandre Aja is not making an Avatar, or a Toy Story 3, where they keep their filmmaking prowess in mind and in depth for 3D. It's for fun. This is this year's My Bloody Valentine 3D, only better... or worse depending on point of view.What plot? Who cares? A lake, spring break, pre-historic piranhas let loose, and GO! At most we get some exposition from a Doc Brown inspired Christopher Lloyd (a wonderful walk-on), and some side characters who are making a Girls-Gone-Wild style tape of the proceedings of lots of naked girls getting it on. And more naked girls. Lots of them. For the moments of unintentional hilarity that are missed early on, Aja makes it up for something that is missing in most American mainstream movies: gratuitous nudity. Hell, there's even a scene where two extremely hot women swim stark naked underwater with classical music playing. It's that kind of show.But once the piranhas come, in full force, that's when the movie becomes even more despicable, in all the right ways. It is such a blatant B movie that you would have to know if you're the audience for it from the trailer - or if you happen to be one of those who saw the original Joe Dante flick. There's tons of good gore and special effects, tons of kills and bodies strewn all over, and it's all tasteless but tasteful. In other words, you have a shameless spectacle that Aja indulges in, but with some sincerity to his craft; this doesn't have the sort of desperate indulgence of The Hills Have Eyes remake. He's become more polished, which may be a turn-off for some looking for a purely Grindhouse experience (also from the same studio people, your ""friends"" at the Weinstein Company).I had a lot of fun with it, by the nature of its let's-go-for-it cast (coked up Jerry O'Connell, stern leader/Sheriff Elisabeth Shue, momentary bad-ass with a blade Ving Rhames, a walk-on by Richard Dreyfuss at the start that is a blatant dig at Jaws), and by its reckless on-screen violence and nudity. This is meant for the drive-in, a low-rent theater, though ironically gets its best make-over with the 3D. It could still be fun in 2D or at home with friends, but as a party it rules.",Piranha 3D
12,BandSAboutMovies,Cheese in the water,4,18 December 2018,"Alexandre Aja may have announced his horror career with High Tension, but he's really been known for his remakes of classic films, like directing The Hills Have Eyes and writing and producing Maniac. Here, he presents a much more satiric take on undersea terror, along with a cast game for pure silliness at times.It all starts with Richard Dreyfuss playing a fisherman named Matt Boyd, but we all know that it's Matt Hooper, particularly because he's listening to the song ""Show Me the Way to Go Home,"" which he sang with Quint and Brody in Jaws. Dreyfuss did this cameo for a large salary, which he promptly donated to charity. Regardless, he's only here to get ripped apart by piranha.Jake Forester is kinda sorta the hero of this whole endeavor, crushing on his old friend Kelly and dealing with her boyfriend and his jerk pals. To make money that summer, Jake is working for porn director Derrick Jones (Jerry O'Connell), who is looking for spots to shoot his latest film with his star actresses, Danni Arslow and Crystal Shephard (legit porn star Riley Steele), and cameraman Andrew Cunningham (Paul Scheer of the podcast How Did This Get Made?). He leaves his little brother and sister behind and takes his crush Kelly onto the porn boat The Barracuda.Meanwhile, Jake's mom Julie (Elisabeth Shue, somehow roped into this gory mess) is searching for the missing Boyd along with Deputy Fallon (Ving Rhames). When they discover his body, they consider closing the lake, but much like every single movie that I've ever seen about killer fish, the prospect of tourism dollars keeps everything open despite the danger.Meanwhile, Julie and a team of seismologists led by Novak (Adam Scott) to discover buried prehistoric lake filled with piranha eggs. They capture one alive - despite big losses - and take it to pet store owner Carl Goodman (Christopher Lloyd!) who was once a marine biologist. He tells them that this species is incredibly aggressive and has already grown cannibalistic.Our heroes try to warn everyone, but of course, people just want to jet ski and have sex in the water, which means that every single person must be devoured by mini-fish with big teeth. Nearly everyone on The Barracuda is killed before Jake reaches his mother for help. Only Jake, Kelly and the kids survive, using the porn director's corpse as bait and as is customary, blowing up something real good to kill off the killer fish.Just when it seems like the coast is clear - literally - Goodman calls to tell them that these are only the babies. Novak wonders where the parents are just in time for one to eat him.Chuck Russell (The Blob, A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: The Dream Warriors) was originally slated to direct this and I would have loved to have seen his vision. That said, this is a fun and fast-moving affair. And when it comes to awesome directors, Aja was planning on having the directors of the last two Piranha films, Joe Dante and James Cameron play boat captains, but Cameron was too busy.",Piranha 3D
13,Coventry,"For God's sake, get out of the water!",6,13 September 2010,"""Piranha"" is a hodgepodge of ingredients that can't possibly fail on themselves already, so can you imagine how successful a mix of them would look like? Number one: it's a remake of an old horror classic and, as much as us die-hard fans might be against those, they're usually big hits at the box office. Number two: the film cashes in on the contemporary moneymaking trend of 3D. Number three: the numerous trailers, teasers and publicity spots promise excessive amounts of two very essential things nudity and gore! And, by God, does the film ever deliver! Number four: a whole series of appealing names in front of as well as behind the camera. Apart from the fresh young faces, director Alexandre Aja also managed to convince some veteran genre actors to appear in his cheerful nonsense film, like Christopher Lloyd and Richard Dreyfuss. So you see, the success formula of ""Piranha"" isn't too difficult to understand, but as said, the film also delivers! The film takes place in the sunny little town of Lake Victoria, on the very first day of College Spring Break. Each year, literally thousands of insane and hormone-overloaded teenagers invade the holiday resort for a holiday full of alcohol, sex, party and watery fun! It's the year's busiest week for Sheriff Julie Forrester (Elizabeth Shue) and Deputy Fallon (Ving Rhames), but hey, it's also Lake Victoria's most important source of financial income. This year, however, the party-goers will get a whole lot more than they bargained for, as an endless legion of ravenous prehistoric piranhas invited themselves to join. Richard Dreyfuss is the first to meet with the sharp-teethed bastards. He's quietly fishing in the lake when suddenly a subterranean earthquake clears the way towards another, even bigger lake underneath the existing one. Here, in this once hermetically sealed off area, the monstrous piranhas survived for more than two thousand years by devouring their own species, but now they crave for a different type of flesh. The sleaze, nudity and bloodshed in this film is totally shameless, gratuitous and pointless  but I guess that's the way we all like it. Is it really necessary to watch topless porn actresses parasailing or to see over-enthusiast ""Hostel"" directors go bonkers over a wet T-shirt contest? Nope. And it's definitely not necessary to be treated to an entire extended nude underwater ballet to the classic tunes of the Flower Duet from the Opera Lakmé, but it was definitely impressive and memorable! At least, finally something to justify the incredibly expensive cost of cinema tickets these days! Admittedly the whole party-hardy sequences of the film are a bit too overlong. Personally, and as a fan of nostalgic creature-feature horror films, I would have preferred to get a little more insight on the piranhas. Christopher Lloyd obviously went OTT with his scientist/fish expert character, but sadly his screen time is rather limited. As much as I love admiring colorful bikinis and tanned cleavage, after a while you just had enough. Yet, once the hungry fish monsters reach the party beach, the water marvelously colors red with blood! The carnage is tremendous, with dozen of kids getting killed either by the piranhas or by their fellow Spring Breakers since everyone panics. The highlights are plentiful, including sinking eyeballs, chewed off penises, parasailing torsos, peeled off faces and numerous gaping flesh wounds. Not exactly Oscar-winning material, but guaranteed summer fun!",Piranha 3D
14,michaelRokeefe,Spring Break piranha attack.,6,24 March 2012,"Director Alexandre Aja in a way is making fun of Steven Spielberg's iconic JAWS. Very decent CGI and a body count to high to decipher. It is Spring Break at Lake Havasu, where hundreds of tiny bikini clad babes and buff bodies are co-mingling and having the time of their lives. An underground earthquake below the Arizona lake releases schools of primitive piranha. With razor-sharp teeth these hungry fish terrorize the merry makers that are reluctant to follow orders from Sheriff Julie Forester(Elisabeth Shue)to vacate the lake. Deputy Fallon(Ving Rhames)tries to give aid in getting vacationers out of the suddenly turning red waters. Fantastic kill scenes full of blood and gore. One of the highlight kills is of a sleazy porno film maker, played by Jerry O'Connell, having his male member being swallowed only to be spit back out. Many, many scenes of full frontal(and back)female nudity. Blood, destruction, gore and death that is hard to match in screen time. One hell of a Spring Break flick, worthy of a cult following. Richard Dreyfuss, who starred in JAWS, makes a cameo appearance in the beginning of the movie. Other stars: Adam Scott, Christopher Lloyd, Kelly Brook, Dina Meyer and Steven R. McQueen. A cheap thrill for sure.",Piranha 3D
15,hitchcockthelegend,"Piranha hunt in packs - not for protection, but for overwhelming force.",7,10 October 2013,"Actually many of today's younger multiplex goers hunt in packs, they know what they like and they know how to have a good time with even the most crude or banal movie. I don't mean that as an insult, it's just indicative of the film market available to them, it's the reason why films like this here Piranha remake/re-imaging/re-jig exists and makes money. Even ""spawning"" a franchise on occasions.Alexandre Aja's Piranha 3D is a complete machine gun of a movie, it knew exactly how to sell tickets at the box office. Even before the 3D was used as a selling point, the word down the grapevine was the promise of lithe bodies in beach wear and loads of CGI killer fish shredding the hell out of a whole community. And that's exactly what is delivered, only with extras that see considerable nudity in the mammary areas and Elisabeth Shue and Ving Rhames kicking buttocks.It's all very bloody, even lurid and exploitive, while it's difficult to know if you are meant to laugh, scream or do something that Russ Meyer would endorse? But, and I say this as a middle aged old fart, there is so much fun to be had here if you are prepared to unscrew your head and take out your brain.

16,Theo Robertson,Somewhat Tasteless But Enjoyable Comedy Horror,7,10 February 2013,"This is a very loose remake of the 1978 tongue in cheek horror spoof by Joe Dante . On the surface it's a film that's probably not all that different than all those B movies that the SyFy channel churn out featuring an underwater fish flavoured menace . Add to this PIRANHA is a film marketed as being in 3D . you think this might be a selling point ? Try and remember JAWS 3D a film so bad it spent many years in this site's 100 worst films list . In other words this film should be a disaster in the making , a film floating through choppy waters destined to hit the rocks and sink without trace and yet against all expectation it doesn'tWhat makes the film if not a memorable classic then at least disposable entertainment is its unrepentant , knowing sense of mean spirited and cruel sense of humour . The big setpiece is a literally dozens of people getting eaten alive by the eponymous piranha school . Normally when dozens of nameless extras are massacred in a film are cruelly killed it's no laughing matter but PIRANHA isn't that type of film . It's a film that celebrates its own meaness and if you're not laughing out loud at bikini clad bimbos and beach hunks getting eaten alive then you've misunderstood the whole point of the movie. I literally laughed liked a blocked drain Somewhat surprisingly being made in 3D has done the film no harm . Before the 3D gimmick made an unneeded come back in the last couple of years a film using this technique continually had unnatural distracting camera angles but here watching it on a 2D television I didn't feel irritated by the difference in medium . PIRANHA is also a film that contain crystal clear clarity in its underwater sequences . Okay it's probably computer generated but at least you're able to see what's happening as the on screen carnage takes place . And remember don't be ashamed to laugh when these scenes take place",Piranha 3D
17,Scarecrow-88,Piranha 3D,7,24 August 2010,"Red meat city, baby. It's a bare cupboard, the plot. This is an effects movie all the way. A fissure opens a cavernous rift which unleashed prehistoric piranha who, in turn, swim for human lunch meat. With spring break at Lake Victoria, Arizona, there'll be a fresh supply of victims for the killer fish to feast on. The inner gorehound in me was howling at the moon, this is a show case for make-up effects specialists Nicoterro and Berger as many handsome/beautiful spring break partiers are torn to shreds, bloody and mangled bodies all over the place as frightened victims splash and scream, trying to swim to safety and unable to do so.Elizabeth Shue is the sheriff, Ving Rhames, her deputy, Christopher Lloyd(all bug-eyed and hamming up without restraint)the fish expert, Adam Scott a seismologist(an earthquake caused the rift which set loose the piranha), Jerry O'Connell a creepy, enthusiastic porn director who convinces Steven R McQueen(Shue's son)to be his ""location scout"", the delicious Kelly Brook(as one of O'Connell's uninhibited girls; her gorgeous body utilized to titillate quite effectively), Richard Dreyfuss(as the fisherman and first victim; an obvious homage to JAWS), and Eli Roth(as a DJ of a wet t-shirt contest)round out the cast.We get such eye-opening moments as Rhames using a boat motor propeller to chop to pieces an army of piranha, a head taken off by a boat, a rival of McQueen's for the affections of Jessica Szohr's Kelly using a boat to mow over swimming bloody kids caught in the water without a means of escape, a face skinned off(..because the victim's hair was caught in the propeller of a boat!), a penis swallowed by a piranha fish(..and spit back out), gaping flesh wounds bleeding profusely(..as many who were able to get of the water suffered serious injuries), legs and arms eaten to the bone, an eyeball that gets away only to be snatched up by a piranha(not to mention the remains of silicone breast implants left floating to the surface after the victim, a bikini bimbo was chomped to bits)moments later, and much, much more. PIRANHA 3D's bread and butter is the massacre at the end and, unlike movies such as this in the past, the police do try to talk the kids out of the water, only to be ignored by the loud, unruly, and very drunk crowd. Once the piranha case the joint, the carnage ensues and doesn't let up for a cool 15/20 minutes. It's a grand spectacle fans of grue will enjoy to the fullest, the ocean bathed in blood, ravaged bodies of those unable to find refuge stockpiling into a heap, many others needing serious medical attention. The big suspense sequence concerns McQueen, Szohr, Brook, and Shue's two younger kids(Brooklynn Proulx and Sage Ryan)trapped on O'Connell's sinking yacht as piranha fish swim abouts hungry for their flesh. Shue and Scott hoping to rescue them before the yacht sinks completely(the yacht is trapped amongst rocks, one of which caused the rupture in it's hull). The great final shot of the movie was positively ruined by the trailers. While I had a good time, I, for one, believes it's time for Aja to move on past these remakes and direct something with a bit more originality. With all due respect, PIRANHA 3D is just another sci-fi channel Saturday original with a far bigger budget and naked women.",Piranha 3D
18,preppy-3,Is this a horror movie or an R rated Playboy movie???,1,28 August 2010,"An earthquake unleashes a bunch of prehistoric piranha fish into a lake. This happens just as spring break is happening and tons of brainless kids are partying in that lake! Sheriff Julie Forester (Elisabeth Shue), deputy Fell (Ving Rhames) and others try to stop them before they kill all the kids (who you seriously want dead). Also Julie's son Jake (Steven R McQueen) is in a sinking boat in the very same lake WITH his younger brother and sister.PLENTY OF SPOILERS AHEAD!!!! OK--the original ""Piranha"" wasn't that good but THIS is even worse!!! For starters there's WAY too much female nudity. Yes--female nudity is expected in all horror films now and I can accept it...but this goes overboard! There's a wet T-shirt contest which offers no other point than to see women's breasts in 3-D. And there's a LLLLOOOOONNNNNGGGG skinny dipping session between two women (set to classical music no less!) which has them kissing and making out. And women's breasts and butts are constantly being shown on screen. Ummmmmmmm--this is a HORROR film right? If I want to see lesbian sex scenes I'll order it online! To make it worse Eli Roth (a lousy director and a sexist jerk) is shown in the wet T-shirt contest spraying down the women! He is killed in a very gory way but that didn't satisfy me. Acting is all over the place. Shue is great despite having nothing to work with. Rhames appears drugged (no surprise there). McQueen is no more than OK. Adam Scott is very good in his small role as Novak. And Richard Dreyfuss does an amusing bit at the beginning (Remember ""Jaws""?) But then we get Jerry O'Connell as a sleazy porno director and Christopher Lloyd as a scientist. They both seem to be trying to show who can overact the most! O'Connell is VERY annoying in his role--you want him dead FAST! Lloyd was SO over the top that my audience was laughing out loud at his performance! Really--just beyond belief.On the up side--Shue was great (as I said before); there was a cute reference to the John Sayles scripted film ""Alligator"" (he also wrote the script for the original ""Pianha""); the special effects were excellent; the underwater scenes were beautiful and the big attack sequence was brutal, bloody and long (LOTS of blood, gore and dead bodies). Then they gotta ruin it with a stupid ""it's not over"" ending.I HATED this. I also find it disturbing that there's an audience out there for films that mix graphic violence and explicit female nudity. Really--mixing those is ENTERTAINING???? A 1.",Piranha 3D
19,poolandrews,Not bad for what it is.,6,9 October 2010,"Piranha is set at Lake Victoria in Arizona where it's spring-break & twenty thousand teens going to invade the town & party, however local teen Jake Forester has to miss out on the summer fun & wet T-shirt contest as his mother Julie (Elisabeth Shue), the local Sheriff, orders him to babysit his younger brother & sister. A large underwater earthquake has uncovered a huge cavern than joins a previously hidden subterranean lake with Lake Victoria & has unleashed hundreds of a once though extinct breed of vicious prehistoric killer Piranha that proceed to start attacking & eating anyone in the lake including Jake & his brother & sister who are stuck on a rapidly sinking boat from which his mother Julie has to rescue them...Directed by Alexandre Aja this is the second time the original Piranha (1978) has been remade, Roger Corman originally remade his own film for television as Piranha (1995) & anyone who says the 2010 version is bad watch that 1995 one & then come back & tell me it's as bad as you thought. Although planned as a 3-D film Piranha was shot in 2-D & later converted to 3-D, since I am blind in one eye I couldn't see the 3-D version even if I wanted to so I will be basing my comment on the standard one eye friendly 2-D version. This remake doesn't follow the original Piranha that closely, out go the genetic military experiments which created the Piranha & in comes an underground earthquake which release the Piranha, out go the summer camp & in comes a wet T-shirt competition & out go the believable adult character's & in come moronic teens & to be honest the only things the original Piranha & this remake have in common are killer Piranha, lots of water & the title. To be fair the first forty five minutes of Piranha is rather average, the menace of the Piranha is hinted at & then built-up along with various annoying teens drinking & partying before the final thirty minutes or so when Piranha explodes into none stop nudity & gore. Piranha moves along at a decent enough pace, I was never bored even if I couldn't say I was exactly interested either until the last third & while the character's here are dumb teens & macho heroic police they are serviceable. The plot is lazy at times, one underground lake couldn't support generations of a species, why did four people hang onto & slide along the rope at the same time at the end? The weight was dragging the rope nearer to the water so why not go across one at at time? Why use a shotgun to try & fight off hundreds of Piranha underwater? Having said that I'm not sure the makers wanted you to take Piranha that seriously & if you can just enjoy it for what it is, some nice scenery, some nice naked girls & lots of Piranha eating people then I don't see any reason why you wouldn't enjoy it.The special effects are pretty good, most of the gore is solid make-up & proper red blood but even the odd instance of CGI computer work looks quite good too & the Piranha themselves look pretty fearsome. People have their legs bitten off, limbs are chewed down to the bone, a woman has a Piranha eat through her head & face, a guy's penis is bitten off & eaten before being barfed back up, there's gallons of blood, a girl is sliced in half & a girl gets her hair caught in a boat propeller & is scalped as it starts. Fans of gore will find much here to like, fans of nudity will too as there's a fair bit on show including a surreal moment where two naked porn actresses fondles each other underwater to the tune of classical music no less. As a side-note director Aja needs to stop ripping other films off & show some creativity, his career as director so far reads Switchblade Romance (2003) which is a slasher, The Hills Have Eyes (2006) which is a remake, Mirrors (2008) which is a remake & Piranha which is also a remake.With a supposed budget of about $24,000,000 this did modest box-office, apparently a sequel has already been announced. Filmed at Lake Havasu in Arizona this looks nice enough & has good production values. The acting is alright, it's not great but I didn't expect it to be. Richard Dreyfuss & Christopher Lloyd have small cameos as does horror film director Eli Roth who gets his head crushed between two boats.Piranha (or Piranha 3-D as a lot of the publicity material calls it) is a film that I didn't have high expectations for & while I wasn't blown away I wasn't that disappointed either, it could have been worse & for those saying Piranha should never have been remade it was back in 1995 & that one is far worse than this. It could have been worse, a gory & fun little film.",Piranha 3D

22,Boba_Fett1138,Simple silly fun!,7,29 May 2012,"Of course the key to liking this movie, is to take it not too seriously. It's also so over-the-top and ridicules that I just can't imaging anyone taking this serious in the first place, though there are still plenty of people like that out there, as it appears.It's a B-movie that is very well aware of itself and actually strives to be taken as a B-movie. Now, this is an approach that can work out but more often does not, since it's too forced and the movies are too slick looking to be taken as a B-movie. However in this case I feel like it did work out well! Throughout the years, I have seen plenty of just plain silly mankind versus nature/animal type of movies. And as far as this sub-genre goes; this is probably one of the better movies out there, that I have seen. It's such an enjoyable film to watch that its story just simply doesn't matter and neither does all of the crazy and just stupid stuff that this movie comes up with.But it's not like that the movie simply only goes over-the-top with its story. It also does so with some of its characters but mostly with its gore. It's an extremely gory film, that also has lots of nudity in it as well. The gore gets so extreme at points that the movie actually starts to turn into a comedy, which is one of the reasons why it also becomes such an enjoyable movie to watch.It's also such a clichéd movie but because of this, the movie actually starts to turn into a spoof. The movie gets deliberately exaggerated in about every way imaginable, such as with its gore, nudity, character behavior and plot developments. When you get and recognize all of this, the movie actually becomes a much more fun movie for you to watch!Of course when you start over-analyzing everything and look seriously at this movie, there is no way you could call this movie a great one. But not all movies are made to be great. Sometimes certain movies are just simply made for entertainment and not to win any awards or receive lots of critical praise. This movie is a perfect example of that. It's purely made for entertainment and it looks to me like the film-makers also had plenty of fun creating it. It also must be the reason why so many big name actors make a cameo appearance in this movie. Lots of people wanted to be part of the fun and madness that got called ""Piranha"". Richard Dreyfuss, Christopher Lloyd and Eli Roth make cameo appearances, while also big name actors such as Ving Rhames and Dina Meyer play bit parts. It's just simple, silly, fun entertainment, that works out very well!7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Piranha 3D
23,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Enjoyable, mostly hits the spot",7,8 October 2010,"After an earthquake, a prehistoric species of man-eating fish is unleashed upon an unsuspecting beach town during party season. Some people try to stop them and survive. Yup, that's the entire plot here. This is a cheesy throwback to 80's exploitation horror, and with that in mind, it's pretty good. No, it's not supposed to be smart, dignified or particularly unpredictable(well, there are a few surprises). If this doesn't either make you laugh or offend you, it didn't do its job. And yes, this is fun... not quite as much as it thinks it is and it wants to be, and the climax is oddly weak. All the clichés are well in place. McQueen(no, I don't know who he is, either) plays the kind-hearted male lead(and pretty flatly at that), Christopher Lloyd(yes, really) portrays that old person in this kind of flick who knows exactly what's going on and explains in a dramatic speech(like all other talent in this, he's underused), and O'Connell gives us a reasonable spoof of the guy behind Girls Gone Wild. That last one seems present mainly for the sake of controversy, as with other things in this(can someone please sit down with all these people with creative control and explain that simply going into taboo territory doesn't render something hilarious or interesting?). Some of the dialog is bad, as is the majority of the acting(those kids... *ugh*). Anyway, that's not what anyone is watching this for. The 3D is nice, and not excessive, with a couple of memorable uses, pushing the level of brutality further with the extra dimension. Done by Aja(who appropriately describes this as ""Gremlins for adults""), the director of Mirrors(it's OK) and The Hills Have Eyes(that I haven't seen), this has a ton of gruesome, bloody, gory violence(there is also plenty of strong language). He keeps the pace high throughout, and with swift(and not in-depth) characterizations, he manages to make us care about the main group, and hey, several of the deaths of the bathing-suit-clad extras are effective, as well. The CGI is well-done, if obvious at times... the practical FX in this are better. This is filmed and edited well. There are jump-scares, and times where this tries to use a strange or loud noise to create a shock. The mood and, to a slightly lesser extent, the tension, are decent enough. This delivers what it promises. Whenever there is a cut in this, there's a 75% chance that whatever shot it goes to has breasts and/or at least one butt in it, even if they may be partially devoured. Numerous of them will be nude... in fact, you see every naked inch of at least a few girls in this, and not only for seconds, either. I don't think the word ""gratuitous"" is really extensive enough. There is a ton of hot, slutty chicks, including ones who've done porn. For anyone wondering, this is a remake of the original(that I haven't seen, but I would like to), not a second sequel to it. Not everything in this is properly followed up on, and a couple of actions are so unmotivated that they are distracting, and/or don't ""work"". While ultimately soon forgotten, a 90 minute ride that, if you intend to take it for what it is, will overall be worth the price of admission. I recommend this to any fan of non-committal, uninhibited and campy B-movies. 7/10",Piranha 3D

What I mean is that they clearly wanted to make a horror/comedy and to do that they had to be no-holds barred outlandish with it.Piranha 3D can be summed up as a funny version of Jaws with more nudity. Piranha 3D even paid a little homage to Jaws with a cameo appearance by Richard Dreyfuss. The movie was so absurd that it was funny. Jerry O'Connell was a riot as Derrick Jones the producer out to make a Girls Gone Wild type movie. Ving Rames' improvised heroics were novel. It was just good humor and violence all around.Sure, you can easily give it a low rating, but come on, I know you laughed at least a little. This movie was along the lines of Eight Legged Freaks or Attack of the Killer Tomatoes and other movies like that.

They also decide to snack on the kids of sheriff Elisabeth Shue who just happen to be on a boat (don't ask) where porno sleazebag Jerry O'Connell is shooting some mildly risqué stuff with Kelly Brook and some other bird. And all in 3D yet.Let me say at the outset that this is possibly the goriest movie I have ever seen and, in over 50 years of movie watching, that's a lot of movies. The gore effects are well done too, in terms of prosthetics, makeup, other physical effects (including the use of amputees), and CGI. Having said that, the gore is massively overdone and frequently very tongue in cheek (as exemplified by the first victim being Richard Dreyfuss).There is (for this sort of thing) a moderate amount of nudity, a plot which progresses exactly according to formula (students get out of the water when ordered to by the sheriff? Naaah!), and a script which is tolerable.Shue plays it straight (and well), as does Ving Rhames in a part which should have been bigger. Christopher Lloyd plays two short scenes as a character who makes Back To The Future's Doc Brown look introverted. Kelly Brook gets to take her clothes off and be mildly sympathetic for a short while. Jerry O'Connell overacts in a part which demands it. Everyone else is pretty much unknown, and this film isn't likely to change that.There is a noteworthy scene where Kelly Brook and another young lady swim sinuously around each other wearing only facemasks and flippers to the music of the Flower Duet from Lakme - this sequence manages to achieve the trick of being sexploitational, hysterically cheesy and naff, and quite beautiful, all at the same time, not to mention being absolutely striking in 3D.Piranhas is cheerful trash, it knows it's cheerful trash and plays to that strength (if it is a strength). If gore and/or nudity upset you, then don't see it: otherwise, it's a hoot. And it provides an outlet for 3D which is both different and effective.",Piranha 3D
27,Uriah43,Could Have Been Better,4,21 October 2015,"""Matt Boyd"" (Richard Dreyfuss) is out fishing on Lake Victoria when an earthquake hits and opens up an underground lake directly under his boat. Not only does he become trapped by a sudden whirlpool but the fissure also allows thousands of prehistoric piranha to escape from their subterranean prison into Lake Victoria. And they are very hungry. To make matters even worse there is an annual holiday taking place at the lake during this same time and this special event typically hosts over 50,000 college students from all over. Now rather than reveal any more of this movie I will just say that it featured two good actors in Elisabeth Shue (as ""Sheriff Julie Forester"") and Ving Rhames (""Deputy Fallon"") along with several attractive young actresses in Jessica Szohr (""Kelly""), Kelly Brook (""Danni"") and Riley Steele (""Crystal""). Unfortunately, rather than concentrating solely on these fine people--and possibly giving both Elisabeth Shue and Ving Rhames roles befitting their abilities--the director (Alexandre Aja) chose to spend an inordinate amount of time focusing on some of the dorkiest men ever caught on camera. Likewise, the music chosen for the multitude of party scenes was equally bad as well. Additionally, one particular scene, which was supposed to be humorous, ended up being just plain silly and vulgar. As a result, although the director had the necessary ingredients for a pretty good movie, he obviously wasn't up to the task and this movie simply proves that point.

In this idiotic film people are warned by police and they still jump into the water. A tremor causes an underwater ground opening and a rare breed of piranha emerges and terrorizes a beach community celebrating spring break. Directed by Alexandre Aja who is no stranger to graphic violence but the 3D is effective. Aja previously made other graphic outings such as the remake of The Hills Have Eyes as well as Mirrors. The cast unfortunately is totally piranha fast food. There is Elisabeth Shue as the local Sheriff whose son doesn't know how to follow orders. Her children seem to do things that people with any form of intelligence would avoid. Ving Rhames plays her deputy who has his own methods for killing piranha although the payoff isn't so great for him. Jerry O'Connell plays a flamboyant beach party host filming a porn flick. Adam Scott is among the rescuers. There are several celebrity cameo with Christopher Lloyd most notable playing off his Doc Brown Back to the Future persona. The film points out that it is in 3D as if that really matters. We are given the severed floating image of a penis before one of these creatures gobbles it up. That was intended to be a laugh but it just comes off as tasteless and desperate. The ending leaves the door open for a sequel with even bigger fish.

What really makes this such a fun experience is that there's just so much fun stuff here that this one is absolutely loaded with positives, and the feeling that it wants to wallow in such material rather than shy away from them is the best sign of all to display here. This one features the kind of material here where it's just so much fun and enjoyable that to contain all these elements with plenty of nudity here from so many worthwhile and appreciated sources not just from the main girls but also all of the debauchery and partying which go hand-in- hand together here and allows this one enough to like here already without getting to the film's other big fun the action and suspense featured. This here is where the film really scores here in that regard as the scenes are enjoyable, from the opening ambush of the lone fisherman on the lake being overwhelmed by the suddenly-released fish, the big ambush in the underground caves against the divers underwater which goes for the absolutely suspenseful with their descent into the cave as well as the search of their breeding grounds before going for the action of their attacks and the big fun of the finale where the race to get out of the sinking boat full of snapping, aggressive fish in one of the film's most suspenseful moments. Still, beyond all this fine action elsewhere, the film's best moments here come from the fish's massacre of the spring break members partying on the water as this here was quite the outrageous blast here as this is pure exploitation goodness featured here, as the events and discoveries leading up to them attempting to close the lake against the partiers, the debauchery of the drinking and wet t-shirt contest all before getting to the fish attacking. Unleashing tons upon tons of gore getting them ripping people to pieces or even just keeping them alive, the numerous rescue attempts getting people out of the water as the panicking masses flee to the other boats and safety while they relentlessly gnaw at those still out in the blood-red waters as all the rescues get pulled away to safety while the action of keeping the fish at bay just makes this one such a fun and exciting overall effort as this whole set-up is completely over-the-top fun. The last plus here comes from the cool creatures those fish are, for not only do they come with a rather intriguing and wholly creative backstory but their design is really imposing and vicious which really lets them look cool even with their lame CGI, meaning this one really had it all. Just to nit-pick, this one had some woeful set-ups that look retarded in normal 2D that were set-up to be in 3D and tend to come off as contrived, yet that is just a nitpick to try to grasp at something in order to give this one something resembling a flaw. Overall, this here was a nearly flawless entry and one of the better entries to come along in a long time.Rated R: Extreme Graphic Violence, Extreme Graphic Language, Continuous Full Nudity, drug use and children-in-jeopardy.",Piranha 3D

It had a wonderful director in Aja, who made a really brilliant remake of The Hills Have Eyes and the wonderful Switchblade Romance, so this had all the potential to be something special.It had a great cast, the added potential of 3-D, and of course, something different in the blockbuster season, and this is what we were given?Despite the fine cast, it's rotten from the moment Dreyfuss destroys any self respect he has by spoofing his role in Jaws, and just like the whirlpool that sucks him up, it goes downhill from there.The plot is basically riffing on Jaws, person of authority tries to prevent a party that will garner huge revenue for the area, but no one will listen, it goes ahead, and the carnage ensues.And there's a subplot involving her children in peril.........on a yacht with the makers of an adult film.It's an unfunny ordeal, with the makers going way over the top with gore and nudity so much, you actually begin to roll your eyes whenever someone gets bitten by the titular creatures, and this is the selling point of the film.The 3-D is is the most irritating I've ever seen in a film, and the whole film becomes an incoherent mess by the time Christopher Lloyd basically says the sequel will get made........Great Scott indeed.....",Piranha 3D
31,Aaron1375,Mindless gore and entertainment,6,29 May 2018,"This film is a rather cheesy film, but sometimes a bit of cheese is a good thing. In fact, I enjoy cheese so to a point I enjoyed this film. It had some great gore in it and it was just a mindless movie where you shut off your brain and enjoy an hour and a half distraction. The film was a modest hit, making its budget back in the states and making an additional 55 million with its worldwide gross, but not a super hit by any stretch of the imagination. The story has a earthquake that unleashes an underwater cavern where there are apparently thousands upon thousands of flesh eating piranha residing. One would think that if these fish were living in an isolated cavern where food was not plentiful they would evolve needing less food, but like I said it is mindless fun as they come out hungry and their victims? A bunch of annoying teen spring breakers, so you are going to enjoy watching them get killed. A teen whose mom is a sheriff goes with this guy shooting a girls gone wild type video (why the heck were those things popular?) and we meet a few people before the fish go on their super kill spree!The film features quite a number of actors such as Richard Dreyfuss who gets credited and I never really noticed him, then figured out he was the fisherman at the beginning of the film. Then there is Christopher Lloyd who was not listed in the credits, but who is in the film a lot more than Dreyfuss. Ving Rhames also plays a role in this one and there are a couple of others of note. They seem to be just having fun with this one and as I said, just don't take it too seriously and it is enjoyable enough. Nothing great, but I could think of worse movies to waste and hour and a half with. The gore effects in places are great and the film leaves off clearly with a sequel in mind. Just one question, how did those two chicks stay underwater for so long without drowning?",Piranha 3D
32,trashgang,one for the teenagers,5,18 November 2010,"Alexandre Aja, he has really a name in the horror genre due Haute Tension (Switchblade Romance), the remake of The Hills Have Eyes and Mirrors. So far so good, real gory flicks and Haute Tension really not for the easy offended. Of course, the call of Hollywood and the $$ depending on it made it clear for Aja that he could go further with more budget and even the 3D aspect as in this flick, but money doesn't always deliver good stuff. Piranha is by many said as a remake but Aja made it clear in the specialized magazines that it wasn't going to be a remake but his personal view on Piranha. The blood flows copiously, there is a lot of nudity and wobbling juggs but it just doesn't work. It takes 30 minutes before the Piranha's arrive, before that you will have boobs and bikini's, but in a gratuitous style. And that bothered me a lot. Especially from Aja. I don't have anything against nudity but here it's more important than the piranha's. The underwater ballet scene with bald kitty cats is nice to see but it really takes too long. A lot of the red stuff is CGI and some shots were really made for the 3D effect. If you watch it 2D you can't be annoyed by seeing that it is meant to be a 3D shot. There are indeed some funny parts (an ode to Braindead) but it's all too late. Sadly this is the first disappointment from Aja.",Piranha 3D

The story is by the numbers, where an earthquake opens up an underground river which has scores of Piranhas in it an the Piranhas swim into an Arizona river where spring breakers are partying. What happens? A bunch of swimsuit clad good looking people get chomped. The 3 D quality is not as good as last years Final Destination film which 3 D quality looked real compared to Piranha. I give the film an 6 out of 10. I noticed the film industry is going 3 D because no one can watch 3 D on an illegal downloads on their laptops.

34,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Piranha 3D,7,18 October 2010,"Alexjandre Aja is fast becoming the director to go to should anyone in Hollywood decide to remake a horror film from the past. He's done The Hills Have Eyes, followed by Mirrors, and then now bringing to fruition a Piranha film in 3D no less, since the only unique selling point possible in having this, or projects of such nature green lit, is if the studios buy in to the 3D hype.You know the drill, where a solid story actually takes a backseat just so that enough gets created to bring on the killer fishes in B-movie fashion, where violence and gore are of the order, and gratuitous amounts of tits and asses (how else can you explain the wet T-shirt contest with a playful Eli Roth, or an underwater naked lesbian ballet?) are staple at every opportunity, what with a Wild Wild Girls video production cast and crew written into the story. The excuse given here in the small lakeside town of Lake Victoria is a seismic incident that causes a rift to be opened up, and who knows that buried beneath a cavern for some 2000 years lie some thousands of pre-historic piranhas which have grown meaner through cannibalism.Slap together an ensemble of caricatures, plus hundreds of partying, beach bumming, summer holidaying teenagers and you have a movie in the spirit of Snakes on a Plane as they get decimated by piranhas one and a time until the entire floodgates in the last act. Aja learns from how Jaws, and other sea-faring monster films build up suspense with plenty of moving legs underwater and the first-fish perspective, enhanced by CG which for the most parts have the piranhas look convincing as mean beasts you wouldn't want to touch with a ten foot pole - they're really ugly critters that you'd just want them destroyed even if it meant upsetting the eco-system. Hunting in packs also upped the danger quotient, as they're small, fast and extremely agile to be taken out by precision weapons.3D effect wise, there were enough opportunities designed to exploit the 3D effect presentation, and this may make for a nauseating outing given the attention to detail when the filmmakers have to creatively come out with hundreds of death-by-piranha scenes, where body parts get nibbled at and chewed off, or through the soaking in blood stained waters meant they peel off. Fans of gore will have a field day in this as I can't recall any other mainstream film that featured a phletora of limb designed, fully or half eaten, ever assembled for the screen, and death through some of the cruelest of methods as well, one which stood out to highlight the selfishness stemming from the instinct to survive.Part of the fun the ensemble veteran cast assembled for the film, such as Richard Dreyfuss to bring forth the very first action scene involving a whirlpool, Elizabeth Shue starring as the town's Sheriff, Ving Rhames as her trusty, beefy deputy, Christopher Llyod as what else, an eccentric scientist, Dina Meyer and even director Eli Roth lending a cameo here. But don't expect anything cerebral to be coming out of this. It's a wickedly fun romp that loads up on the gore factor if anything, and largely forgettable once you laugh at how certain scenes were incredibly far-fetched.",Piranha 3D

But, despite its merit, this is clearly a B-Movie, that doesn't even aim to achieve any greatness. The Screenplay offers the correct amount of nudity & gore, while Alexandre Aja's Direction is fair.

37,StevePulaski,Death scenes not as sharp as the teeth,6,10 September 2011,"It's clear that Elisabeth Shue, Ving Rhames, Christopher Lloyd, and Jerry O'Connell all have a sense of humor because, while they all have been in great films, they still go back to do something they would if they were just starting out. I think this time they went back for the love of the genre, and felt they could bring something to the table with Piranha 3D, which you can tell by the poster art, is an all out satire and comical parody of Spielberg's timeless classic Jaws.Piranha 3D does almost everything right, except that it has the gimmicky, overused, and unnecessary stamp at the end of its title to most likely leach onto more money and so people don't get confused since this was already remade before. Yep, a remake of a remake of an original. The original film, titled simply Piranha, was released in 1978 cashing in, once again on the big Spielberg film. Then the remake from Roger Corman and Joe Dante was released in 1995 which failed to do much but rustle up a cult following.The plot: Jake (McQueen) lives off the coast of a beach with his sheriff mother (Shue) and his two younger siblings. Forced to watch them while she works, Jake decides to ditch them for ""spring break boobies,"" and to photograph naked women with his best friend Derrick (O'Connell). It isn't long before the sheriffs discover the lake is swarming with schools of angry, razor-sharp teeth piranhas ready to devour anything with the scent of blood. They try to warn everybody, but they just continue their beer and sex antics. Looks like the piranhas will get a fulfilling lunch.This doesn't necessarily fail as an attempt at a satire, as much as the CGI kills most of the death scenes. The film is very bloody, like one would expect - but the fact that most of the death scenes are dominated by unbelievably fake flesh and poorly crafted CGI is pitiful. It's worse than The Final Destination, released the same weekend. The only reason the CGI is there is to make the 3D look more realistic. But once it's on DVD, and on Television, people will see that the special effects are virtually inexcusable and they only worked if you saw the film in its 3D form at the theater.Some scenes go beyond plausibility and could never happen in the first place. There is one scene where a character falls in the water and is pulled out only to have both legs showing muscle tissue, blood, and no skin in sight. The character is still speaking, and winds up lasting another five minutes before finally dying. It's an anomaly of the horror genre.I have to admit that some scenes were nothing but creative. The opening scene has a cameo from an actor I'll never get tired of, and the end scene caught me off guard. I applaud seeing some bigger names to the cast as well because, like I said, when you get big you still need to occupy some sense of humor. I loved Elisabeth Shue from The Trigger Effect, a rather unsung film, and whenever I think of Christopher Lloyd I don't think of Back to the Future. I grew up with Cyberchase, and the villain on that show was voiced by Christopher Lloyd and named ""Hacker."" Lloyd didn't strain his voice, that was genuinely how he sounded. Now whenever I hear him I can't help but picture Hacker. This isn't a bad thing, since I love picking out the similarity in people's voices. Piranha 3D is honestly a bit nostalgic for me, and that's one thing I didn't expect.Still, the tiny bit of nostalgia it packs doesn't excuse the goofy death scenes and the abundance of CGI. It's a splatter flick - but not a great one. You have to leave your brain at the door when you see these, and while this one knows what it wants, it still has trouble getting there in one piece. Same goes with the characters in the film.Starring: Steven R. McQueen. Elisabeth Shue, Ving Rhames, Christopher Lloyd, and Jerry O'Connell. Directed by: Alexandre Aja.",Piranha 3D
38,Smells_Like_Cheese,Makes you double check your plane ticket for Spring Break,7,6 September 2010,"Remember back in the golden era of movies that was the 1980's? Well, not so much golden as more implausible, but still one of the decade's best genres was horror movies. The one's that have become silly fun cult classics over the years because of it's unbelievable plot, excessive amount of blood and sex that scared and thrilled the audience at the same time. Piranha came out in the later 1970's, I saw it on TV when I was a child with my parents, in fact we always joked how it was a family movie and since it was right before Christmas it was a holiday film. But it was a very cheesy film along with it's predecessors, I mean, come on, Piranha 2 had flying fish. Nevertheless, it needed an upgrade and who knew that Alexandre Aja could pull it off? Now I do like this director, he always does a great death scene in his movies even if they are a bit dull and he delivered in the gore and guts this time. This movie knew exactly what it was and didn't try to pretend otherwise because it's just a really stupid plot. The fact that I enjoyed this movie was just a surprise to me, it's just a bloody good time with some great laughs and fun scares.Piranha is about a boy Jake who reunites with his old crush, Kelly during spring break, before being chased off by her boyfriend. He meets Derrick Jones an eccentric pornographer, and Danni, one of his actresses. Derrick convinces Jake to show him the hot spots on the beach for an upcoming pornographic film the following day. Meanwhile, Jake's mother, Sheriff Julie Forester, searches for the missing Matthew Boyd at night with Deputy Fallon, who has found Boyd's boat. They find his mutilated body and contemplate closing the beach down. Eager to enjoy spring break for once, Jake bribes his younger sister and brother, to stay home alone so that he can show Derrick around the beach with Danni. Jake goes to meet with Derrick but encounters Kelly first, who invites herself onto Derrick's boat. Two scientist divers explore the opening in the lake that the body was found in, Novak speculates that the rift is a passage to a prehistoric lake buried underneath. Paula and Sam scuba dive to the bottom, discovering a large cavern at the mouth of the opening, containing large egg stalks. Sam is torn apart by a massive school of piranha when he ignites a flare; Paula scrambles to escape but is eaten. Novak and Julie pull her corpse into the boat, capturing a lone piranha still attached. Novak and Julie take it to the pet shop owner, Mr. Goodman, who examines the fish and explains that the piranha are a long-extinct prehistoric species, and had been trapped in the underground lake for over two million years and need to be stopped before they reach spring break.One of the pleasures of this film was seeing Christopher Lloyd who is playing his mad scientist side from Back to the Future. He was way too funny and said his lines with spunk and made his role absolutely memorable. Richard Dreyfuss gets his due with his cameo, pretty much playing homage to Jaws. The cast seemed to have a good time, but the stars of the film that top the cake are the extras. I was thinking about how much fun it must have been to be an extra in that film because you can tell there are people that are over exaggerating their deaths but just having a total blast with it. Not to mention the incredible deaths that will make you cringe, scream and as bad in taste as this sounds but also laugh. This is one of those films that you just have sit back and have a very good time with, letting go of your ""critic"" self. There is a ton of nudity in the film, just a warning to those who find it offensive. But once again, it falls into that category where I can let it go because it's all done in a comedic way. I had a good time watching Piranha, as silly as it was, it didn't take itself seriously, so you shouldn't either. I'm recommending this film to those who just want a fun horror movie, this is not for the squeamish however seeing as there's a certain hot dog shaped human part that is chewed up by a piranha and just spit back out.7/10",Piranha 3D

What you will get while watching this a lot of gruesome and bloody parts with a lot of ass and titties. The cast is also full of a lot of porn stars, so if your one of those that like to see nudity on the big screen in 3D, I guess your in for a treat. Although I won't give the film a lot of credit for that since there is already the internet for that. The death scenes are actually really gruesome and sometimes even creative, even if the effects aren't really that great. Plus most of the people that get killed in this you don't feel any sympathy for, plus it's a movie so it adds to the entertainment for a film like this. There are a few cameos, but I personally thought it was just pointless and didn't get why they wanted to do this, except maybe Eli Roth for obvious reason. This film isn't for everyone but if you want to see a lot of gruesome scenes, with some nudity thrown in. You might come out of the theaters entertained.6.5/10",Piranha 3D
41,Hellmant,"Cheesy Exploitation Creature Feature, done right!",8,26 August 2010,"'PIRANHA': Four Stars (Out of Five) This 'B' monster film is a remake of the 1978 cult classic of the same name, which was executive produced by Roger Corman and directed by Joe Dante (Who later went on to direct such other quirky popular flicks as 'THE 'BURBS', 'GREMLINS' and it's sequel). I don't think I ever actually saw it, if I did it was so long ago that I don't remember and I possibly just saw parts of it as well, so I can't compare this new version to the original. I have seen the sequel a couple times which came out in 1981 and was James Cameron's directorial debut (although he was fired from the film before it's completion). This new version was directed by Alexandre Aja who started out making French horror films like the very popular 'HIGH TENSION' and then recently made a name for himself directing all American made horror remakes (like 'THE HILLS HAVE EYES' and 'MIRRORS', followed by this). The film is released in 3D, which looks great and horror flicks like this are perfect for it. It was advertised under the title 'PIRANHA 3D' which made me think it was actually the second sequel (in a very loose way) rather than a complete remake. Now this film has done so well in it's first week (financially and critically) that a sequel of it's own is already in the works! Elisabeth Shue stars (who you might remember from such 80's classics as 'THE KARATIE KID','ADVENTURES IN BABYSITTING', 'COCKTAIL' and 'BACK TO THE FUTURE PART II and III' as well as an Oscar nominated turn in 'LEAVING LAS VEGAS'), as Deputy Julie Forester, she was a childhood celebrity crush of mine. Forester, with the help of fellow Deputy Fallon (played memorably by Ving Rhames) and Novak (played by Adam Scott), discovers that a bunch of prehistoric man eating piranha have been set loose, by a tremor, in their hometown of Lake Victoria. To complicate things thousands of tourists are on Spring Break vacation there and her son (played by Steven R. McQueen, from the popular TV series 'THE VAMPIRE DIARIES') is out filming a sleazy pornographic video aboard a boat on the lake with the video's sexist director (played by Jerry O'Connell), his cast and crew and the boy's would be girlfriend (played by the beautiful Jessica Szohr, also well known for a popular TV show named 'GOSSIP GIRL'). Tons of explicit nudity, sex and gore ensues.The movie has about as much graphic violence and gore as I've ever seen in a movie but it is done in a mostly campy and comedic way. It also has about as much full frontal female nudity as the MPAA has allowed in an R rated movie. This has caused a lot of controversy and discussion. Perhaps the film got away with it because of it's campy comedic nature or the 3D computer like visuals. Does it really matter? The film is what it is; a cheesy exploitation creature feature. It does what it's supposed to perfectly. The acting is mostly blah, the dialog is weak and the film contains several ridiculous scenarios with almost complete disregard to logic. The effects are cool, including some very realistic and disturbing bloody aftermath wound scenes, and the gore is out of control. The movie is a lot of fun. Short and sweet, almost a little too short. It's only real flaw is that I just expected a little more; there's no scene where Forester argues with some selfish business man about shutting down the Spring Break celebration and the end is a little too abrupt. For the most part the film is exactly what I expected though and I'm sure it will soon be a cult classic 'B' monster film of it's own.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9G9Ubb99VY",Piranha 3D
42,thesar-2,It's not just boobs in 3D!,8,20 August 2010,"First I was shocked to see 2010's Piranha 3D received an 80% on Rottentomatoes.com (to date.) Then after seeing itI was blown away that it actuallydeserved that rating.Sure, I expected silliness, clichés and B-Movie quality including tongue-in-cheek acting and dialogue. The previews didn't hide a thing on what to expect. You will, in fact, get silliness, clichés (every one of them) and tongue-in-cheeks, but if you're into horror/When Animals Attack films of the past, like I am, you will LOVE this movie.In addition, I rate movies higher that don't lie to me, like the recent The Expendables movie did. Like the previews, this movie did not hide one fact of its B-movie genre. It dove directly into all the predictability, all the formulas this type of movie typically portrays and if you can get past the fact this wasn't meant for the Best Picture Oscar and understand that you wouldn't be watching a movie entitled ""Piranha 3D"" or see the previews without knowing what you're getting yourself into, then sit back and have a great time like I did.Immediately in the film, Matt (Dreyfuss – it's absolutely no coincidence who he's supposed to take after, heck, listen to the song he's singing) is fishin' & drinkin' & soon spinnin' in his boat in Lake Victoria (really Lake Havasu, AZ) following an earthquake that frees thousands of prehistoric piranha.Bad timing for the 100s of tourists of the annual Spring Break water events, as seen on (M)TV. Naturally, there's one Sheriff (Shue) with a minimal police squad to keep the peace. To throw in tension, she has 3 kids whom she commands to stay off the lake (even before she realizes there's more danger than the drunken college kids.) And to round out the main cast, we have a dirty film maker (O'Connell) who exploits women, drugs and minors. Oh, lest I forget, there's the crazy scientist who, of course, can explain what's happening to the audience and who definitely couldn't have been played by anyone else than Doc Brown, himself: Christopher Lloyd.By just reading the previous paragraph and if you've seen any, literally any When Animals Attack films of the 70s and 80s, you can put the pieces together on how all that's gonna pan out. The real fun is the fish in the sea themselves.Believe it or not, the movie contains actually good acting, plausibility to both the creatures and how humans would truly react, tons of suspense, tension and originality in regards to attacks (both by them and us) and surprise when they are supposed to occur. In addition, there are plenty of in-jokes, real jokes and, naturally, a boatload of nudity (yes, also some male) and gore.Damn straight it was gory. And for the most part it was the typical B-Movie gore that I barely blinked, as I had expected it. However, the movie takes a turn in a few scenes that flat out shocked me on how far brutal they made it. Though I do applaud them for taking it to the next level, some scenes were really disgusting – you try walking on that leg, for example.As mentioned there were comedy bits and nudity to balance out the whole homage to the genre. Some were even combined. My favorite scene involved both a fully nude water ballet that had me rolling and my favorite line was, no joke, about a man's member, though the aftermath, while funny, was a little overkill.The obvious climax – let's see, 80% of the film we see young mostly-to-fully nude youths in and out of the water – was impressive, bloody, tension filled and satisfying even though it was expected. I even liked the final few minutes of the film. Again, I knew what was coming, but not the actual revolution.I will say the movie was near perfect for what it was supposed to be, yet, there were a few flaws I couldn't get past. Even at just 89 minutes, the middle dragged a bit. The pacing was just plain annoying in a few scenes that went on far too long, such as the dive to the revealed cave. Sure, they make up for it in the full second half and they gave plenty of attack scenes – some that kept me thoroughly interested because they actually were original in a completely unoriginal movie – so I'm not entirely complaining. And if you think about it, nearly all When Animal Attack films contain a minimum of two to three scenes that slow down and let you catch your breath. So, it's nothing but consistent.As for the two other ""problems"" I had may not have been the movie's fault. In the screening I saw, the 3D seemed a bit off. I could see extra lines or shadows of some of the objects or people. It didn't happen throughout, but it finally got bad enough, my eyes were actually looking for it. And finally, the marketing gave away a critical scene. I won't ruin it, but suffice to say, since I saw it in the preview, it became more and more evident that this would be either the final scene or damn near it. I was right and shame on them – it's bad enough they spoiled Richard Dreyfuss's cameo, but to give awaywell, I don't want to be guilty of it too.Overall, it's obviously not everyone's cup of tea and though it contains the title of Piranha, and its all-but advertised as a remake/reboot/sequel, it has zero connection to the previous two installments. That said, I doubt I could give you any warning of what you're getting yourself into when you sit down with those Buddy Holly 3D glasses. It's like a roller coaster: without too much depth and it's a pretty quick ride, but in this incredibly bleak summer (and year,) strap yourself in and have a blast.",Piranha 3D

44,Robert_duder,Absolutely P E R F E C T!! Here is why...,9,22 August 2010,"I am not an adolescent teen who will tell you why 3D boobs and people getting cut up is 'giggle giggle' so cool. I'm a 30 something year old man who loves movies of all kinds. I have almost 1000 reviews to my name and I will watch ALMOST anything...good, bad, funny, scary, romantic, cute, Disney, whatever. For all the haters of this movie I have to say you are the foolish ones going to see a film called Piranha 3D about killer fish at a spring break party and expecting something deep and prolific. Piranha fills a very specific expectation and does so with absolute near perfection. Hear this...Piranha 3D is an absolute homage/re-creation to the 70's, and 80's exploitation 'grindhouse' films of yesteryear. The gore and violence is blood splatteringly deliciously gratuitous. The nudity is ridiculously over the top, it is practically everywhere including an absolutely absurd underwater, classic music montage of two naked girls swimming around each other. The special effects are plentiful and silly, the only work put into the piranhas themselves is to make them look as campy as possible. This is true camp and done perfectly and with that in mind. This was NO accident.I'm going to start with the absolute stand up performance of the film. Jerry O'Connell plays sleazy producer Derrick and is absolutely wonderful. He is over the top ridiculous, funny and campy all in one and he embodies his performance and what it was meant to be. Steven McQueen comes from mostly Television and is okay in his role as the young 'hero' of the film. Oddly the two heroes of the film give in many ways the weakest performances. McQueen just looks out of place and doesn't play up to the camp at all. Jessica Szohr who I know as Vanessa Abrams from Gossip Girl gets the same review for the most part. While her and McQueen have decent chemistry they don't really stand out. Elisabeth Shue gives a solid performance as the tough as nails Sheriff. Ving Rhames is absolutely perfect as the Sheriff's deputy and sadly gets victimized too soon because he fits perfectly into the cast. Kelly Brook and porn star Riley Steele fill their roles appropriately as being the main nude attractions. Character actor Adam Scott is good in his role but very underused. I think he could have really impressed in the film. Also honourable mention for the terrific cameo from the legendary Christopher Lloyd.I have a lot of respect for director Alexandre Aja after he created one of the greatest horror films of the 2000's and a remake to boot (The Hills Have Eyes), and although I have only seen one other of his films (Mirrors) which wasn't top notch but I am convinced he has a lot of talent and this proves he has a love and passion for horror and for the great B movies of yesteryear. If nothing else this film is absolutely not for everyone. Be very aware that the gore is through the roof. The 3D is mostly unnecessary but adds to the campiness and probably to the fact that it will manage to make back its 25 million dollar budget because otherwise it would likely be straight to video fodder. There is a strangely slow part in the middle of the film where they discover the underground cave and a few other minor plot points and then when the savage disgusting and hilarious slaughter begins you will be wide eyed, laughing and cheering at the camp. Just see the film for what it was meant to be and you'll have a romping good time. I loved it for all it is!! 9/10",Piranha 3D
45,bowmanblue,If you go into the water today...,7,2 November 2014,"...you'll probably get mauled to death - probably not a nursery rhyme that will really catch on, but it does tend to describe the film. Piranha 3D (note: I didn't watch it in 3D) is about - you guessed it - a horde of nasty flesh-guzzling fishies eating hordes of scantily-clad teenagers. In fact, fat people were obviously not allowed on set during this production.There are bad films and there are good bad films. I'm pleased to say this is the latter. You should basically know what you're getting - no Shakespearian dialogue or massive character developments or plot twists, just daft, silly (and very gory) fun.However, it's worth mentioning that just because this film was very 'popcorn watchable,' not every film in the same league is. I've also watched the sequel 'Piranha DD,' and, in short, it's rubbish. Whereas this one was a lot of silly fun, the second time around it feels forced and there's nothing new.If you're looking for some grisly fish action and bikinis aplenty, then you have found your holy grail.",Piranha 3D

But history I think will notice this little gem as well.Because the ""other"" way is to take the standard and predictable tale and -- like a martial artist doing Tai Chi -- exaggerate every single movement, action, visual, and piece of dialog.In other words, it is what you expect, but much more. It is excess to the point of excess. It is overkill. Part of your brain likes what it sees and part of your brain wants to run to the parking lot and hide in the trunk of the car.That is the genius of Aja. From the opening scene from iconic Richard Dreyfus (JAWS) becomes a snack, to the semi-serio-comic close, you can't help but notice how technically perfect everything is.That is the beauty of this deconstruction.

Just unbelievable gross. I can't not believe it got a 5.5. That is just overrating it. It is not a remake of the classic horror masterpiece Piranha (1978). The only thing this movie has in come with Piranha (1978) is there are both about the same kind of monster. Other then that it is like saying Interview with a vampire is a remake of Dracula. Do not waste your time. Do not waste your money. Do not see this awful movie. Good actors wasted there talent being in this awful movie. The special effects crew did a great job. I can not believe that same man who wrote Sorority Row wrote this crap. He can do a good job if he wants to. This a great movie to skip. Do not see it.,Piranha 3D
49,Rodrigo_Amaro,"Horrible, horrible",2,9 February 2012,"Absolutely pointless, ridiculous from the first minute up until the very last shot, ""Piranha"" is one of those movies that if possible shouldn't exist at all. But they do exist to give some money to the studio who needs it to finance another movies and they get happy regardless if their audience enjoyed the film or not. It comes as a shocker to see the Weinstein brothers producing this garbage but it's completely understandable: they get lots of their money back easily with a flick like this than to make, let's say ""The King's Speech"" a box-office hit (it became a hit after all the awards given).I can't describe how low this is, you'll have to see it for yourself but I wouldn't advise you to do that. What's the point of of wasting almost two hours of your life with something that only shows CGI fishes killing dumb people all the time?It's a really disgusting film, you might put your guts out while seeing what those piranhas do with the fellas who crossed their path, I mean, their water. That includes: blood and body parts all over the place, and a penis being chewed and spit by two piranhas, among other things. Basically, you'll be doing the facepalm through the whole thing (but if you're a guy you'll handle this flick better since there's lots of boobs coming on). It's a nasty butchery!But why, oh why such a good cast of actors had to be part of this scam? I know actors need to pay their bills, need to work and they need to eat, just like the piranhas here, but I also think they should've try harder and do some other thing, and I'll bet they weren't so well paid for this. Ten years from now and you'll hear them say ""I only did it for the money"" or ""It's the worst movie I've ever made!"".So, Elisabeth Shue, Steven R. McQueen, Christopher Lloyd, Ving Rhames, Adam Scott, Eli Roth, Jerry O'Connell (oh dear...) and Richard Dreyfuss (paying an tribute to the brilliant ""Jaws"" right on the opening); they all have some good moments in this, they practically save this bomb of being worse than it is. But they shouldn't be in here.Mark my words, don't go near this or you'll be deeply affected. Avoid it like the plague! 2/10",Piranha 3D
50,johnnyboyz,"The banquet of fast food that sounded like a good idea at the time, but quickly rears its true colours on the consumer as something you don't really need nor want.",5,7 August 2011,"To attempt to even imagine Piranha, one needs only to recall the opening scene of Steven Spielberg's 1975 film Jaws and try to envisage it cranked up beyond all measurable necessity; occurring half-a-dozen or so times in a film that's 88-odd minutes long in duration, and with an additionally gross influx of heavy gore, blood and nudity chucked in for good measure. In short, the film is stupid; but it's stupid in a fashion that sees it stay at ""just"" stupid. The film is directed by a certain French born Alexandre Aja, a man who has helemed horror film remakes in the past of whose competence, and competence is the key word here, did not come in for much in the way of criticism upon release. Rather, Piranha is a fruitless, albeit very merry, romp through easy material executed in a fashion that sees its makers wholly identify just how dumbed down it all is: if one were uninformed enough not to know that the same man whom heralded this 2010 incarnation of Piranha directed the 2006 remake of The Hills Have Eyes, one might have to think twice upon hearing such a fact out of suspicions of being lied to.The film begins on a remote lake; unpopulated and within the domains of some tall wire fence looking like it's seen better days displaying a ""Keep Out"" sign. Note: when a film entitled Piranha begins as such, and you do not correctly guess what happens next, you're partaking in the wrong hobby of film-watching. On the lake, in his little boat, sits Richard Dreyfuss, who's doing a spot of fishing with a radio on and a beer in hand. A lot has been made of the parallels between Dreyfuss' character here and in the aforementioned Jaws – I got a bigger kick out of figuring out that the last time I saw a film featuring Jerry O'Connell that was bookended by Dreyfuss' presence was Rob Reiner's Stand by Me. Dreyfuss gets a bite, and amidst the struggle with the fish, his beer bottle drops into the water before plummeting downwards onto the bed – the final straw in the natural opening up of a crevice thus letting loose dozens of piranhas and dooming an awful lot of people.Indeed, Aja has experience in dealing with a ""cornoned off government site housing beasties that are now running amok"" movie; the previously mentioned The Hills Have Eyes feeding off a similar premise but actually arriving with more scares; more terror and a grimier, grubbier atmosphere. In a nearby coastal town, this thing Americans call ""spring break"" is in full flow, and Elizabeth Shue's sheriff Julie Forester (a strong, empowered female presence counter balancing most of what else we get in that regard) along with her deputy, Fallon (Rhames), are taking very little in the way of stick from clumps of childish, usually shirtless, hormonal young men dotted around. Her son is Jake, played by a certain Steven McQueen, and yes, his grandfather is whom you're thinking – most say McQueen went on to achieve special things, he began his acting life as an extra in 1958's The Blob: there's hope yet for his grandson. Jake, unlike most of the other men in the area, chugs around on that of a scooter frequenting the ports, not to partake in the yacht-set shenanigans of booze and breasts, but for more ""mundane"" reasons.At home, he is dominated by his mother and little siblings just as he is by the seaside jocks; the rummaging through of some internet pornography suggesting a lack of, but a desire to, intermingle with the opposite sex. His chance to do so arrives with the equally young Kelly (Szohr), and the film takes glee in putting them together out at sea with a high-maintenance pornographer plus crew, before allowing shoals of the titular killer fish to swarm into proceedings and chomp away at those on their break we're thoroughly disillusioned with, anyway. Amidst all this, there are bits-and-bobs of a strand suggesting the film is about Jake's realisation that such crass behaviour exhibited during Spring Break is wrong and ill-minded; while for Kelly, the idea she risks veering off and away towards the bleak and undesirable lifestyle exuded by that of the porn stars she shares time with feels equally prominent.But we all know the film is actually about the blood; boobs and bonkers material Aja happens to throw up – surprisingly so, because it's not as interesting and there are, at best, probably only about two decent set pieces in the entire thing. We grow tired of the film's incessant use of the close ups to capture various women's chests, often unclothed, when it isn't zeroing in on anonymous people mindlessly leaping into stretches of water. It is very much the sort of film in which, despite being little under an hour and a half, lends five minutes of its time towards two stark-naked females swimming in slow motion to the Lakme Flower Duet; a sequence presciented by the makers' channelling through one of those partaking via the line: ""You ain't seen nothing yet."" I know - boy could those women hold their breath! Alas, the negatives outweigh anything remotely interesting; the film's lone African-American presence is disparagingly punished for his apparent transgressions of possessing helpful, insightful characteristics. Additionally, there is a woefully misjudged few minutes or so sequence in which people, in all their tattered and mangled glory, wash ashore post-piranha attack which, whilst we're on the subject of Spielberg pastiches, ill-advisedly induces iconography of the Saving Private Ryan beach landings opening that has no place in a mock-up, knock-about movie such as this. From its guilt-edged opening to its final shot consisting of a Deep Blue Sea rip off (at least we didn't see it coming in Deep Blue Sea), Piranha is ""dumb-fun"" which I wouldn't really go so far as to label all that ""fun"".",Piranha 3D
51,TheMovieDiorama,Piranha 3D stupidly bites and chomps its way to the third dimension.,4,4 April 2019,"Remaking Dante's 1978 original was bound to happen at some point. Hollywood has run out of ideas for fishy B-movie horrors. So here we have a modernisation of the schlock-fest that is Piranha. I'm sure the question burning in your minds right now is: ""how do you modernise Piranha?"". Tits. No seriously, tits. Breasts bouncing and bobbling across the water. Boobs literally coming out of the screen. A twelve-year old's wet summer dream. But in order to get to the bountiful treasure that is apparently the female anatomy, one must survive the shallow waters that is the plot. An earthquake splits a lake floor and causes a school of ravaging piranhas to populate the lake during spring break. I'm sure you can guess what happens.Right, so the film is bad. Lifeless characters, atrocious visual effects that one would find in a SyFy film, a waste of a perfectly adequate cast and enough plot conveniences to write a porno film. Speaking of, the sheer amount of tanned flesh in skimpy bikinis actually enabled a character to be a sleazy pornographer. If that isn't the most obvious way to get tits into a film, then I don't know what is. Oh, Dreyfuss is in this! Isn't that absolutely flipping hilarious because he was in 'Jaws'? Ahhh good times. The parodied script and, well the screenplay in general, never really worked.However, before you feed me to the piranhas, hear me out. What made this a tolerable and surprisingly fun time was the ridiculous amount of gore and fun director Aja had with the film. On several occasions, I actually (prepare yourself) laughed. Just something about Eli Roth getting crushed by a boat had me smiling for a minute or two. Clearly my sadistic side getting tingles. Watching a large group of teenagers fearfully screaming and getting eaten alive considerably increased the film's fun factor. The 3D, despite it being a gimmicky flaw, made it that little bit special. Oh, it's still a bad film which has lost all the charm from Dante's original, but an enjoyably tolerable one at that. Tits and gore man, tits and gore.",Piranha 3D
52,BaronBl00d,T & A and Blood Over-load,5,13 October 2012,"This is in no way one of the worst films ever made. It is clearly splashed with excess T and A as well as blood that it will definitely turn some viewers(and their stomachs) away. But never, and I mean never, does the film take itself seriously. How can you take a film seriously that has Spring Break ""kids"" listen to loud music, dance in bikinis(or not much else if anything at all) while the threat of flesh-eating piranhas envelops them. The big grand guignol scene where these spring breakers serve as a ghastly buffet to the flesh-eating prehistoric predators in this little area that makes all its money at this time of the year is so hyperbolic in its blood and carnage and yet has some moments of humor, sick I grant you, twisted(as with the girl and the boat motor), and yet never believable. Now, I am not a gorehound by any means. Seeing two girls sliced in half from a flashing cord does not do anything for me. Nor does seeing a woman have her ass ripped out from under an inner tube. Nor does seeing a guy in a boat just run through screaming, half-alive bodies only to meet a fate we all know will befall him shortly. The blood, the guts, the violence was much for me, but in all of this director Alexandre Aja shows competence, a dark yet intriguing sense of humor, and clearly an eye for anatomical female beauty. This film could have easily been nothing more than hard, unrelenting violence, but we get characters we care for such as the lead young man, his mother, and his two younger siblings(Aja follows the rules with regard to these characters). We have some decent if uninspiring acting from lovely Elisabeth Shue, a nice though weird comedic performance from Jerry O'Connell which shall prick some viewer's interests, a bizarre Ving Rhames who takes a boat propeller into the water and kills the killer fish(what a hoot!), and cameos by Richard Dreyfuss in the beginning who is the cause of these killer fish being unleashed in the lake - and also makes the film interesting from the very beginning! and then there is Christopher Lloyd as the owner of a pet store who appears to also have a degree in paleontology. Last but in no way least are the bevy of girls that Aja has parade throughout the film. Most cannot act - but hey, who cares right? All are hot and sexy and buffets for the eyes, but Kelly Brook really stands out - both literally and figuratively. She is just plain gorgeous! I do not recommend this film for everyone, but if you have an idea of what to expect before you start viewing - c'mmon look at the poster for the movie and who is in it, then there should be no big surprises for you. Movies like this that try to do what this movie does often do a much worse job. This was really a notch-above-the-rest for a film of this ilk.",Piranha 3D
53,insomniac_rod,Aja's style. You know what to expect even on Spring Break.,8,23 May 2011,"Alexandre Aja once again demonstrates that he can create terror anywhere. And I say anywhere because this time he starts a wave of blood (no pun intended) caused by killer pre-historic piranhas. The crazy situation gets interesting when these animals attack spring breakers and remind them that excessive partying always means death in Horror cinema. The movie looks like any E! Entertainment Television program but Aja makes sure to remind us that it is HIS horror movie where he takes control and throws body parts, blood, guts, and more to the screen. Get inside this bloodbath.The plot is simple but works perfectly for the movie's tone. The sub- plot about a brave single mother gets important when the security of the town and of her own children depends on her. There are gruesome moments that also flirt with black humor such a piranha devouring a penis, and more. Ving Rhames is the ultimate bad-ass. You'll see what I mean. The score is not so bad if you take in consideration that hip-hop is the new ""in"" when it comes to spring break. Give this movie a chance. It's one of the most entertaining modern blood feasts.

But it is a lot of fun, especially when the real madness happens, with hundreds of party goers thrashing about, and scrambling to safety. This bloody sequence goes all out, taking it to the hilt. The piranha look as real as fake hooters, and them depriving a dying O'Connell of his member, was amusing if with ""Are you fu...ng me"" expression.

57,dfranzen70,You have to be kidding me.,2,17 May 2011,"I can only assume that Piranha, itself a remake of a parody of horror films, is supposed to be a comedy of sorts. It can't possibly be straightfaced, because not only would that be in opposition to the premise of the original, it would be a massive failure. This version will surely disappoint anyone who takes it to be serious horror cinema. Sure, there's gore, but it's funny gore.If it's meant to be humorous, then Piranha is an uproarious, unmitigated success. It's about on par with the recent spate of SyFy Original horror movies, the ones with prehistoric crocodiles and octopuses and the like. It's also probably one of those rare recent movies that looks better in 3D than in 2D; in the latter format, you can tell where the object was supposed to look like it was coming right at you, because instead it sort of floats there, disinterested and bathed in ennui. Which is what you'll be if you take this movie seriously.The setting is a remote lake in Arizona, which is apparently a spring-break destination for thousands of nubile, hormone-laden teens. A mild earthquake under the lake causes a new fissure that joins one underwater lake with another - and the second underwater lake is home to the titular fish. Only they're not your typical piranha, which of course aren't from around those parts anyway, they're prehistoric, or something. Christopher Lloyd, who plays the local animal expert, says so.Elisabeth Shue plays the sheriff, and she has a working force of what appears to be three or four guys. Sure, one of them is Ving Rhames, but really? To control all those teenagers? That makes sense.The sheriff's kid, played by Steve McQueen's grandson, is a Nice Guy who agrees to take a skin-flick producer (Jerry O'Connell) to a secluded lake spot so he can do some filming - instead of watching his younger brother and sister, who immediately go off in a rowboat and get lost. It's that kind of movie.Meanwhile, the piranha, released by the quake, take aim at scores of barely dressed women. And some guys, I'm not sure. There's a lot of blood, so it's hard to be certain. A literal bloodbath. There's decapitations, hair caught in propellers, slices and dices, and, well you get the idea. Lots of red stuff, lots of half-naked people. But it's more gross than engrossing.At one point, the sheriff calls in the National Guard. At the time, I thought that seemed like overkill, because all the cops had to do was get the kids out of the water - i.e., Close the Beach. But when that proved to be too much for them, I could see her point. In any event, the National Guard never shows up, perhaps the smartest thing they did that day.(Really - the cops yell at the kids to get out of the water, and the celebrating resumes, mostly unabated, with music blaring. A gunshot to the boombox would have solved that.) Although the movie's pretty funny, in a sick-minded way, it could have been funnier still. Shue's cop corps isn't bumbling, which might have made for some wacky hijinks. What we have are smart people doing either nothing at all or only vaguely dumb things, like leave their teenage son home to watch the youngsters when there are literally hundreds of horny, drunk women waiting for him.This Piranha has little of merit. The old one featured some old-time stars, like Dick Miller and Barbara Steele, and was fairly serious. And it worked. Joe Dante did a great job on a limited budget. Here, a lot of money was spent on a lot of nothing. There are no scares, and it's possible that the added dimension would just make it funnier.",Piranha 3D
58,dee.reid,"""Piranha"" = Sushi? Not!!!",6,29 September 2012,"As you may or may not know, 2010's ""Pirahna"" is a remake of Joe Dante's semi-classic 1978 ""Jaws"" (1975) parody ""Pirahna."" Alexandre Aja's remake is a gory one, albeit a gore-fest with some impressively gruesome practical special effects courtesy of Greg Nicotero and Howard Berger (from ""Evil Dead II"" and most recently, the critically acclaimed AMC TV series ""The Walking Dead""). Yet, despite the gross-out gore, this movie's tongue is planted firmly in its cheek.The virtually non-existent plot concerns a minor earth tremor that releases scores of a previously undiscovered prehistoric species of flesh-hungry fish, the vicious piranha of the title, into Lake Victoria, which unfortunately is in the middle of spring break festivities. It's up to Sheriff Forester (Elisabeth Shue) and USGS science nerd Dr. Novak (Adam Scott) to save thousands of drunken and bikini-glad party-goers from becoming fish food.I'll say that ""Pirahna"" is a vicious little late-night distraction for a big-budget horror flick. Is the film scary? No, not really. Is it entertaining? Yes. It's so entertaining, in fact, that it really zips along through its plot so fast that the whole thing's over before you know it (with a surprise ending that no doubt leaves room open for a sequel - see this year's ""Piranha 3DD"" for further details). The only thing that I feel really diminishes the experience is that not only is ""Piranha"" extremely gory (even for an ""R""-rated horror-comedy such as this one), it's also very disgusting. After a feeding frenzy involving thousands of man-eating fish on drunken unsuspecting party-goers, you can see Nicotero & Berger's gruesome special effects in their full gory glory and it's far from being a pleasant sight. As I stated earlier, it's pretty disgusting and you better have a strong stomach to watch it.I also mentioned that this movie's tongue is planted firmly within its cheek. Despite the vicious gore, there's a perverse sense of humor shooting through the proceedings. Much of the humor centers around the ultra-sleazy porn director/producer Derrick Jones (a scene-stealing Jerry O'Connell), who hires out Sheriff Forester's teenage son Jake (Steven R. McQueen) as a location scout and she has to come to their rescue when the boat they're on becomes stranded in the middle of the lake. And just in case you were really wondering how bad this movie parodies ""Jaws,"" there's a moment early on in the film when middle-aged fisherman Matt Boyd (Richard Dreyfuss, of ye old ""Jaws"") becomes the piranhas' first hapless victim.Despite the gory practical special effects and plentiful female nudity, ""Pirahna"" is an interesting late-night distraction - as far as horror movies about man-eating fish go...6/10",Piranha 3D

Ving Rhames did have plenty of medieval Piranhas on his ass as Deputy Fallon. Adam Scott co-stars as Novak, a ?, I actually forgot who he was because his character was totally useless and forgettable. Richard Dreyfuss and Christopher Lloyd even make brief cameo appearances in mimicking their ""Jaws"" and ""Back to the Future"" characters. Jerry O'Connell is in over-the-top form playing an obnoxious porn film director. The rest of the cast of ""Piranha 3D"" is comprised of amateurish performances from ""pleasing to the eye but not to cinematic taste"" young actors. Nevertheless, ""Piranha 3D"" is not a thespian showcase. The Piranhas in the movie are the real stars of the flick, and the 3D effect did heighten their viciousness. So do not expect a horror ""masterpiece"" (as when the Piranhas attack the silicone breasts) in ""Piranha 3D"" but there is something fishy going on in your local movie theatre that is worth diving into. **** Good",Piranha 3D

63,MaxBorg89,Preposterous - in a good way!,7,11 October 2010,"On paper, the 2010 version of Piranha was a combination of two bad movie categories: crappy horror remakes (let's face, it the Piranha franchise doesn't have that glorious a pedigree to start with, Joe Dante's fun original notwithstanding) and gratuitous 3D pictures, where the added dimension is added only to enhance the ""money shots"" (gore and nudity). Fortunately, in the hands of remake expert Alexandre Aja, the new Piranha becomes a perfectly enjoyable piece of B-cinema, one that is aware of its own limits and turns them into assets.Set near Lake Victoria, Arizona, the 2010 update rejects the genetic manipulation premise of previous entries and opts for another angle: this time, the killer fish are remnants of a prehistoric species, set loose after an earthquake unveils their home situated under the current lake. With Spring Break beginning, a potential buffet is waiting in the water, including teenagers (Steven R. McQueen and Jessica Szohr), a porn crew (Jerry O' Connell, Kelly Brook, Riley Steele), seismologists (Adam Scott and Ricardo Chavira) and the Sheriff's department (Elizabeth Shue and Ving Rhames), and it won't take long before the holiday turns into a bloodbath...All the ingredients for a disaster are present: basic writing, oddball casting and, most of all, 3D that was added in post-production. However, the film was always meant to have an extra dimension, so the scenes were cleverly filmed so that they could work even in a converted state. Besides, the bizarre mix works quite well because Aja, knowing he's handling something that could provide unintentional laughs, goes for the deliberate comedy effect, refusing to take any of it seriously. Whether it's creative bloodletting - with one kill taken straight from Final Destination - or displays of flesh (including an underwater lesbian sex scene and a fish chomping on a penis), Piranha 3D is a hoot from start to finish, unafraid to go anywhere to hit the ""fun"" button.This concept goes all the way down to the aforementioned bonkers casting, with each one doing his best/worst with the ludicrous material: Richard Dreyfuss pulls off a perfect Jaws spoof (a reference to the original Piranha being a rip-off of the Spielberg hit), Christopher Lloyd relishes the mad scientist schtick and Ving Rhames does the usual ""horror movie black character"" with great joy. And that's without mentioning Eli Roth's standout cameo as a wet T-shirt contest judge...Overall, as a proper movie, Piranha 3D would be an unholy mess; as a piece of gleeful, throwaway fun, however, it delivers all the goods. It may not be the best 3D film of the year, but it sure is one of the most entertaining.",Piranha 3D

67,dwpollar,Graphic exploitation film ...,3,29 December 2012,"1st watched 12/27/2012, 3 out of 10 (Dir-Alexandre Aja): Graphic exploitation film that mixes bloody fish-eaten people with a little bit of semi-porn and a touch of black humor to make for a pretty messed-up movie. The story begins with an icon from the ""Jaws"" movies, Richard Dreyfuss, being the first devoured by the man-eating fish from a pre-historic lake opened up below Lake Victoria by volcanic activity. Elisabeth Shue, plays the Sheriff of the Lake (which is a hotspot for College spring-breakers and the wild wild girls' drunken activities), and find the remains of Dreyfuss's character and instead of closing down the lake lets the fish reign of this mass of nude & semi-nude vacationers – who eventually all become quite bloody. With a few scenes being borderline Pornography and the amount of bloody gore – I can't believe this got an 'R' rating. One unbelievable scene has a piranha chewing and spitting out a penis from one of the victimsI have Never seen this before in a movie!! The movie is so bad and outrageous that it brought out a few laughs from me(which made it slightly viewable). The best scene was a rescue scene near the end where the filmmakers try to redeem themselves but it's really too little too late. They ended the movie with the expectations of a sequel with bigger piranha but I haven't seen this happen yet and I hope it doesn't. If nothing else, this movie is for those looking for extremist entertainment, where the filmmakers were aloud to do much more than they should have and none of those things made for a good movie, in my opinion.",Piranha 3D
68,JoeKarlosi,Piranha (2010) **,5,22 August 2010,"(Possible Spoilers): Another remake that aims low and succeeds in that effort. I just came back from seeing it, and I'd rate it only about ** out of ****. At first I was sure I was going to score it lower based on the ho-humming first half or so, but later on when we finally got a full-blown gory piranha attack on a hundred arrogant spring break swimmers, it delivered some fun at last. Yes, that's the idea -- no elaborate story required -- just that there's this lake teaming with man-eating fish, and annoying young Spring Break partygoers with no respect for authority are getting chomped on (yay!!), and have to be saved ... so what else is there to say? I thought Elisabeth Shue was adequate as a toughie female sheriff for what little she had to do. Her son, played by Steven R. McQueen, was just your typical do-gooding, hearthrob boyfriend. The slimy and self-centered porn director was a complete jerk, but that was the whole point of his character and so it's quite satisfying when he gets what's coming to him. Ving Rhames was wasted, but I certainly felt a little touched by his character's heroic fate. Christopher Lloyd played his usual dopey role, but I thought he could have been put to better use. I despised all those partying ""Girls Gone Wild"" college jackasses, so when they finally became stringy piranha fodder it did my heart good. Some of the CGI effects were convincing, others were obvious and silly. Some of the over-the-top dismemberment sequences and carnage got to be unintentionally funny. This is just a mindless popcorn flick, nothing more or less. I had some fun with it, but it's not a good movie and I definitely wouldn't return to it. When I left the theater I did spot one man in his 40s with his little son. They both seemed to enjoy it, and the kid was saying ""That was good"", while pop concurred: ""Yeah, it was just like an old horror movie!"" A word about the Richard Dreyfuss cameo at the beginning of the film. Yes, this was a clear indication that this film was to be tongue-in-cheek, but at the same time I felt kind of let down to think of what became of our beloved ""Matt Hooper"" after JAWS. That is, until I paid attention to the closing credits which had Dreyfuss listed as playing a character named ""Matt 'Boyd' "". So, my friends, he's not actually who you think he was! ** out of ****",Piranha 3D
69,Jonny_Numb,The Deep Six,1,30 August 2010,"To paraphrase Freud, ""there are times when a piece of detritus is just a piece of detritus."" Similarly, there are times when a CGI weiner is just a CGI weiner. And on that same note, there are times when a heavily hyped 3D horror film manages to be so much less than the low standard it sets for itself. By the end of its 88 (mercifully fleeting) minutes, ""Piranha 3D"" had me wondering if a camera crew was going to enter the theater, revealing that what I had just watched was a practical joke before running the ACTUAL film.Needless to say, that didn't happen.Which means that yes, ""Piranha 3D"" really IS that bad.Alexandre Aja, the French wunderkind behind the bloody psychothriller ""High Tension,"" the mercilessly brutal remake of ""The Hills Have Eyes,"" and that iffy movie about killer mirrors, has spent the better part of a year heralding his latest venture, an update of the Roger Corman-produced, Joe Dante-directed ""Piranha"" (itself a rip-off of ""Jaws""). The concept seemed like a lock: the titular creatures with the razor-sharp teeth and unquenchable thirst for blood go ballistic on a couple dozen hardbodies during spring break; and to sweeten the deal (for those who prefer gore and boobies in their lap), the project would utilize 3D, the current industry standard for inflated ticket prices and deflated expectations.How could this possibly fail? The problems with ""Piranha 3D"" (subsequently making it an even more frustrating picture) are so numerous that a college film course could be devoted solely to picking apart its flaws. The most glaring is the general lack of development all around: not just the characterizations (which are almost appallingly non-existent), but the plot (Christopher Lloyd is trotted out for a few lines of unconvincing exposition), the effects (the piranha exist in two forms: obvious CG close-up and murky, dark mass), the editing (the spring-break bloodbath is an incoherent mess of torn flesh shot largely in close-up), and the 3D itself (for a film that began with the notion of being an immersive experience, its use of the medium is actually less impressive than it was in ""Friday the 13th Part 3,"" a film that's nearly 30 years old). In Henry Selick's ""Coraline,"" the 3D effect was used to enhance elements of character and story that ultimately made the film an engaging trip into another world. In ""Piranha,"" the effect (when it makes a rare, underwhelming appearance) is an obvious cash grab that feels like outright thievery.In 2010, I thought the horror genre could see no greater low than the misbegotten remake of ""A Nightmare on Elm Street."" How wrong I was.",Piranha 3D
70,robertemerald,"Great blood splatter romp, but suffers from not knowing if its serious or not",8,29 February 2020,"There's no doubt that Piranha 3D is entertaining. The underwater photography is actually really good, even artistic, and most of the attacks are also a wizard blizzard of cgi, yet with a lot of taste. There are many classic scenes here, in fact, you could take stills from almost any compass point along the movie's arc and have yourself a great poster. Yes, you could compare it to Jaws or Jaws 2, only expect things to go berserk, and by the end there is a frenzy not just of blood and attacks, but of cheese, boobs and half eaten body parts. That's basically the problem with the movie, and why it would be hard to give it a 10. Firstly, the movie never quite becomes all out camp, and battles with its serious side whilst all manner of grotesque images and snapping smiling piranhas capture very conceivable contortion you could ring from a movie about killer fish. That's a bit of shame. If they'd styled it back a bit I think they could have had a serious rival for Jaws, or at least Lake Placid. The other problem is the character playing a soft porn movie Director, which is way over the top and simply not believable. Again, if only they'd turned it down a notch. That being said, all up there are just too many things working well in this movie for it to be ignored. Face it, it's a classic, and the world is a better place for its existence. Just don't tell your kids about it.",Piranha 3D

Nobody can write a serious bad review for this movie, as it gives exactly what the title and concept promises, plus infinitely more. Piranha 3D has your usual killer fish premise. But this time, it's in 3D. Now, I hate 3D, mostly because filmmakers are denying the gimmick that it is. It IS a gimmick. It isn't to draw us completely into new worlds and a new experience. Here the 3D is used to titillate and disgust. So we have a few people shooting a porno on a boat, whilst others are ripped apart by piranhas. Kelly Brook, naked, swimming, making out with another woman, in 3D? Now there's a fantastic application of this technology. A torn off penis floating in front of you, then swallowed, then regurgitated? Another unique use. This film is sick and disgusting to the point of hilarity. Just as the film has had plenty of Piranha deaths its success depends on how they can vary the kills. They do it soooooooooo well. Motorboats and wires are just two of the ways to kill, kill, kill. Scattered about we have some wonderfully satisfactory performances, and a few smile inducing cameos. Big dumb cinema is fine, as long as it's an unstoppable entertainment ride of pure awesomeness. This is what we get here. In its genre, it's pretty much perfect.",Piranha 3D
72,raulfaust,American Pieranha,5,22 December 2011,"This time, the piranhas are monsters of mass destruction that terrorize a whole city. While the classic version had a good plot and an interesting film pace, this one is focused in gratuitous deaths and hot women for a teen (and easy) audience. The cast is nothing to be blamed-- with exception of McQueen playing a 17 years old, when you can obviously realize he's more than twenty. Directing also isn't a thing to be criticized-- I believe it has a strong direction with a well built background sound, which deliver this film a suspenseful time. But, however, nevertheless, it's full of stupid things-- for instance, Jake trying to be a hero in the end for a girl he barely knows, come on, who would risk your own life for a girl you just met? Also, piranhas eating that man's dick is truly ridiculous, and so is the very last scene. So that's it, ""Piranha 3D"" is sometimes TOO gory for a young audience, and most of the time is too stupid for an adult one. This film will at the same time impress and disappoint both audiences. All in all, I see no need to state how much I preferred the original version of ""Piranha"".",Piranha 3D
73,eric262003,Submerge in This Great Horror Remake,8,23 July 2012,"""Piranha 3D"" is an upgrade to the original 1978 horror and is loosely a spoof to the classic 1975 movie ""Jaws"". Directed by French director Alexandre Aja (""The Hills Have Eyes""), takes us on a journey to Lake Victoria, where the lake has been inhabited by giant killing piranhas that have caused havoc amongst the fish and tourists who have visited the area. As absurd as it may seem, we must ask ourselves, why would these killer fish unexpectedly go out on killing frenzy by destroying everyone they see? According to local legend, under the lake there was another lake and these monster fish submitted to cannibalism to survive in these difficult times where all the other prehistoric lizards were succumbing to extinction. And when an earthquake erupts, the killer fish are free. The second explanation is that well to all those who live in a perpetual world where everything has to be factual and real, to just get a grip already. It's a horror-comedy, not a paleontologists dream for excavating underwater sea creatures that roamed the Earth 15 million years ago. It's just to turn your mind off for 90 minutes and enjoy the scenery and throw in some laughs along the way.Okay so this movie's script is very pedestrian and leaves little to the imagination, but it has the integrity of a B-movie and never once does it try to hide that fact. However, the acting (not up there to win any Oscars) was on the whole not too bad. Sure there were some rather silly parts to it, but it's a horror film and the dialogue is not to be taken seriously. But there are some highly prolific thespians and are well developed to point that we actually hope they pull through somehow in the end. The humor implemented in the script matches similarly to sex-based films like ""American Pie"" and ""Hot Tub Time Machine"" among others which is pretty good, although very lewd in nature depending on one's choice of humour. Who can't resist watching those killer fish devouring a severed penis? Remember it's all about one's taste for humour (pun not intended). The effects were very tantalizing and the 3D viewing worked out very well. The piranhas were intimidating and the gratuitous death scenes looked believably authentic. It felt that the characters were really suffering during the whole ordeal. The weak point was that the ending looked cheap and it was just designed for the purpose that there's going to be sequel to Piranhas in the near future. It will surely happen thanks to the opening release that was given a handsome profit of $10 million.Will this movie disappoint? Not as long as you go in expecting to see something uplifting or artistic or even a film that will change your life. I knew it had none of those qualities so therefore I was not disappointed to say the least. Even though the expectations were low standard, one thing that sticks out is that it is a very fun movie to watch and bring along a few friends too. It's great to watch at night when there's nothing else on the television it may not be for all, but it is a fun watch and shouldn't be taken seriously.",Piranha 3D
74,Matt_Layden,"Boobs, Blood & Doc Brown.",7,21 August 2010,"An underwater tremor unleashes thousands of hungry Piranha that have thought to have been extinct for millions of years. Bad timing, because it's Spring Break. Piranha was, what some people called, a rip off of Jaws. Another person wanting a piece of the pie. It went on to have a sequel, to be directed by the now famous James Cameron and it seems that it is time for a remake, in 3D no less. Do we need a remake? Probably not, but the film is fun and excessively violent, which makes for a good time for those looking for b- movie horror goodness. Piranha delivers on the levels it aims for, take that as you want to.Alexandre Aja directs this film, let's just forget he did Mirrors okay? He gets the bloody mess off to an interesting start by having Richard Dreyfuss in the film. A nod to Jaws no doubt, but one can only assume that he had him in here to say that this film is either a: More scarier or B: More dangerous. I'd go with the latter because the film isn't scary. What's more dangerous though? One shark, or thousands of Piranhas? You pick.So it's Spring Break, so the fish have hundreds of young drunk teenagers to eat, and boy do they eat. The film doesn't shy away from the bloody truth. Piranha's can strip a cow to it's bones in minutes, these guys are more aggressive. They've been feeding off each other for millions of years and now they have a variety of meat to pick from. Yummy. So people die in bloody, over the top, funny ways. The film is one for the people who cheer when someone has their legs torn off. If that's not you, you might want to stay away from this one. Also, if you're not a fan of naked women, you might want to stay away from this one. This film is full of naked women, left right and centre. There is even an underwater naked swimming dance sequence set to opera music. It's weird and funny at the same time because it comes out of nowhere. The film could have used more of it's cast. We have Richard Dreyfuss, Ving Rhames, Christopher Lloyd and Eli Roth. All of them are underused. Rhames, I thought was going to have a more hero type role, he doesn't. Roth has a total of maybe two scenes as does Lloyd. Dreyfuss only shows up at the beginning of the film. Once again, an interesting cast that is not put to good use. The film decides to stick with the blood and boobs. The film is in 3D. I expected to have more fun with it than I did. Although I did enjoy it more than other 3D films I've seen. It has a more gimmicky feel to it and it actually fits with the film. Seeing bits of Piranha fly up at you is fun. Boobs in 3D, fish in 3D but the things that were used the most were the underwater coral reefs. The theatre lost power near the end, so the last 3 or so minutes of the film we saw with no sound, but I could tell what was going to happen, even with the lack of audio. I'm not letting that affect my review for the film, but I can sense that the film was going to go for one of those jump-scare-abrupt endings. Piranha 3D is a hoot, for those who know what they are getting into. In my theatre there were children, this is NOT A KIDS MOVIE!!!! This is more bloody and violent than any SAW film.

A bunch of prehistoric piranhas get unleashed after an earthquake at a lake that just happens to be a big destination for Spring Break. And, it's Spring Break. I'm sure you can guess what happens next. The vicious little predators start gobbling everything up in sight, and it's up to the town sheriff (Elisabeth Shue) to save as many people as she can, as well as her own kids. The rest of the cast is populated by a bunch of people that you maybe be familiar with to varying degrees (Ving Rhames, Jessica Szohr, Adam Scott, Kelly Brook, Steven McQueen), and depending on who they are, they have one or (possibly two) of four roles: be eaten, be almost eaten, save someone from being eaten, or be hot. There's also a fair amount of making out, screaming, and thrashing about while yelling. Let's just say that multiple Academy awards probably aren't likely for any of the actors involved, but they all do a good enough job. I though Piranha was a lot of fun. It was over really fast (I was literally surprised by the ending when it arrived), and leaves the door wide-open for a sequel. A sequel I can just about guarantee that I'd go and see (yes, in 3-D), if made. The nudity factor is pretty high, and the piranhas like boobs just as much as your average guy does, if for different reasons.

76,Chase_Witherspoon,Soft porn piranha,4,14 January 2012,"Punctuated by some entertaining moments, this spoof of the 1978 classic employs more T&A than your average loop (so I've heard) and enough blood, guts and dismembered limbs to rival a Mexican drug war. When I first read that ""Piranha"" was to be remade, I salivated at the thought of Brad Dillman or Barbara Steele coming out of retirement to make a cameo. So when I read the cast list, I was a little disappointed (though I'm a big fan of Shue). After seeing the final product, I'm not surprised. It's an embarrassment. Entertaining in parts, but on the whole, a turkey of Christmas time proportions.Some of the mutilations are sadistic - the boat propeller scalping was neither funny, nor suspenseful; just plain poor taste. I liked Jerry O'Connell's over-the-top playboy characterisation and for the most part, Ving Rhames and Elisabeth Shue do the business, but Adam Scott's character and his erratic interpretation, was as pointless as it was pitiful. The Richard Dreyfuss and Christopher Lloyd cameos lend some film cred, but they're self parodies and all too brief to be completely effective.They say there's more than one way to skin a cat, and it seems director Aja has applied the metaphor to humans being devoured by piranhas - absolutely macabre. The scene in which the two submerged nudie bathers grope and fondle one another set to ""Lakme Flower Duet"" (a soprano opera duet) is sure to bring the house down with laughter - or simply cause you to switch off and give yourself an upper cut for wasting valuable minutes of your life.

After a sudden underwater tremor sets free scores of the prehistoric man-eating fish, an unlikely group of strangers must band together to stop themselves from becoming fish food for the area's new razor-toothed residents. (The Weinstein Company)If you go in a film called PIRANHA 3D, chances are you know what to expect. Gratuitous nudity? Check. Over-the-top violence? Check. Buckets amount of gore? Check. Horrible acting? Eh--debatable. But overall, if you go in with the right mindset, you'll be entertained. Still, I was disappointed. I didn't have as much of a blast as I did with SNAKES ON A PLANE in 2006. It also wasn't as funny as I thought it would be. All I got were a few chuckles. I guess that's what I get by watching the film with six other audience members. I have no doubt that if you're in a filled theater that you would have a grand ol' time, assuming that every audience member goes in with the right mindset, of course.The main strength of the film is that it doesn't take itself too seriously, although not to a point where it's making fun of itself. It knows that it's an exploitation flick and it has fun with it. Also, as much as I do oppose to converted 3D films (like 99.9% of other movie goers), the 3D in here actually looked legit, as if it were shot in 3D. ""How is that possible?"" you might ask? Well, the filmmakers shot the film with the 3D in mind and took the time (almost half a year, I believe) to convert the film in 3D rather than do a rushed conversion like THE LAST AIRBENDER and CLASH OF THE TITANS. I guess taking time really is worth it!The performances by most of the cast is surprisingly good. Elisabeth Shue and Jessica Szohr were the ones that impressed me the most. I've seen Szohr in GOSSIP GIRL in which she was also fantastic in. I hope she gets her big break soon. I've also enjoyed Steven R. McQueen as the lead character and cameos from Eli Roth, Richard Dreyfuss, and Christopher Lloyd are always great to see. I didn't like Jerry O'Connell, though. I found him really annoying.With my mild disappointment, I was still entertained by the film.

81,DJAkin,Best GORY movie of the past 10 years,10,12 April 2012,"When I decided to watch this, I was not sure what to expect. However, I was very pleased with how good it is! The piranha are very evil and mean. They look right at you! They are very prehistoric and have pure anger when they go for their prey! The actors are great. The actor Richard Dryfuss was excellent as the fisherman and Christopher Lloyd of TAXI was amazing as well. I could not believe how GROSS this movie was. The fish eat everything in sight. The boat party scene where all the spring breakers are not listening to ""get out of the water"" is the gore fest of the ages! It makes DEAD ALIVE by Peter Jackson look like CHILDS PLAY! The fish eat penis, eyeballs and skin right down TO THE BONE! Many of the victims try to get out of the water only to end up half eaten! There is this one scene where a woman's head is ""degloved"" by a propeller on a boat. The guy who O'Donnel plays is a jerk. In real life he is married to Rebecca Romain Stamos but in this movie he is a porn director. He sniffs cocaine and drinks booze and can't drive a boat to save his life. But he is certainly good fish food! I was glad to see Ving Rames in this movie as the propeller sheriff who doesn't say ""UGLY"" like he did in TRUE BLUE - instead he says the F word a lot. This movie has it ALL! It has Eli Roth as the guy who talks into a blow horn and directs a wet t shirt contest! There is a good storyline in this movie and Elizabeth Shoe delivers the goods on all throttles! One of the funniest scenes was when the eyeball is floating in the water and the fish piranha eats it! He eats it in one gulp! Move over Jaws - PIRANHA is in town!",Piranha 3D
82,Troy_Campbell,A bona fide guilty pleasure.,6,27 August 2010,"If you have no desire to see gore-galore and gratuitous nudity then don't see Piranha, it holds about as much value to you as Pride and Prejudice does to adolescent boys. If you have no desire to read about gore-galore and gratuitous nudity then don't continue on past this sentence, there's not much else I can talk about in this review. Those of you still reading out of sheer curiosity, you have been warned.The latest horror remake from director Alexandre Aja, following on from The Hills Have Eyes and Mirrors, has a distinct advantage over said precursors: it has tongue planted firmly in cheek. In fact, I would argue that Aja's Piranha isn't a horror flick at all. The violence on offer – a poor girl's face is ripped clean off thanks to her hair being stuck in a motor, another nubile lass dies after being decapitated in half but not before showing her displeasure in what has just happened, a piranha chomps its way out of the mouth of yet another unlucky lady, and the list goes on – is designed to make you laugh, or at least scoff, at its ludicrousness, not to sicken or frighten you. True, you may jump a few times due to the whiplash score, but even then the immediate reaction afterwards is to chuckle at your own silliness in being spooked so easily.It helps that the screenplay is so gleefully impudent. Scripters Pete Goldfinger and Josh Stolberg know exactly how bonkers the premise is and they have a blast milking it for all it's worth. Featuring a pair of fan-pleasing cameos – Dreyfuss is a good sport in his pre-title scene and Lloyd hams it up nicely in a couple of ""Great Scott"" moments – and plenty of winks and nods to previous fishy horrors, I found it hard to wipe the grin off my face. Throw in a few additional crazy things like completely-naked-and-extremely-hot-female-porno-stars kissing underwater to the sound of classical piece 'The Flower Duet' and projectile vomit coming right at you (the 3D is actually pretty decent) and you have a bona fide guilty pleasure.A popcorn flick of the highest order.3.5 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)",Piranha 3D

84,oneguyrambling,Schlock and awe. An efficient little horror flick.,7,27 December 2010,"This may be the first film review where the review is longer than the script that was to make it, in fact I think it took me longer to write this than it did to make the first 2/3 of the film, and don't worry this will be brief.Someone mentioned over a mouthful of sandwich one day ""Alexandre how cool would it be if ancient fish came back and attacked Spring Break kids?"" and Mr Aja said ""Stop right there! I'LL NEED 16M, WE START Wednesday!"" The plot is this: Ancient fish come back and attack a bunch of kids at Spring Break.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ There are thousands of vacuous party-idiots at Lake Victoria. Idiots that need eatin'.Among the boneheads is sleazy T&A filmmaker Derek (Jerry O'Connell), his cameraman and a couple of immaculately disproportioned young chickies to point the camera at.A wide eyed young local boy of about 17 named Jake dodges babysitting after being conscripted for location finding duties (they then film the ladies underwater rendering the locations pointless I would have thought). Must've been a big choice for a 17 year old – ""Sitting"". ""Titties"". ""Sitting"". ""Titties."" ""Oh who am I kidding?"" His female fancy Kelly also hitches a ride to provide a damsel who will somehow attract a certain level of distress.The babysittees are both about 8 and just independent enough to get themselves into trouble, and to cap it all off the local law enforcement seems to consist of Ving Rhames and Jake and the two kids mum (Elizabeth Shue gunnin' for that second Oscar).When seismic activity opens a fissure into a water-system, unleashing a species of long since thought extinct vicious cannibal piranhas anxious to try new taste experiences the plot goes out the window. Feeding time.The last 20 odd minutes are a blood soaked orgy of shredded flesh and screaming teens.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ There are many boobie shots in the film but the film slows down enough to feature a couple of assets more prominently – and to be fair there is pretty good reason.There are hundreds of kills but the film slows enough to feature a few of the more graphic, and with many deaths comes much gore, some computer generated and some good old fashioned effects: guy's body through the floor kinda stuff.I didn't love Piranha 3D and it didn't bring much new to the table, but it knew exactly what it wanted to be and was very efficient in that.You don't have to do much research to find out that there is a lot of flesh on display, both the good kind and the gore kind, this is where Piranha 3D excels, the only improvement might've been trying to put a couple more jokes into proceedings.Piranha 3D ends up in the company of films like Dog Soldiers, Black Sheep and Zombieland, but two or three more decent rib-ticklers might have pushed this a little closer to classics like The Descent, Tremors and Slither.Final Rating – 7.5 / 10. Piranha 3D is a fun horror film. Boob-induced hypnosis will keep the young blokes squirming in their seats until the bloodbath starts and then it's the dates turn to squirm.",Piranha 3D
85,TheUnknown837-1,"the original 1978 ""Piranha"" was dimwitted and a lot of fun. This new ""Piranha"" is even more dimwitted and only about half as fun",4,26 August 2010,"The original 1978 ""Piranha"" movie, directed by Joe Dante, is a classic example of B-movie exploitation done right. It was so enjoyable on a guilty pleasure level that even though it was a more than obvious rip-off of his film ""Jaws"", Steven Spielberg himself convinced the executives at Universal to drop their pending lawsuit against Dante and producer Roger Corman. Now I will never, as long as I live, claim that ""Piranha"" was a *good* movie. It was a bad movie. But it's what we like to call a ""good bad movie."" It was corny, preposterous and dimwitted, but it was also a lot of fun and quite humorous. And it was meant to be that. A sequel directed by James Cameron followed a little while after, but then there was a long gap in his franchise. Now Alexandre Aja, who made ""Mirrors"" (2008) takes the director's chair of a loose remake of the first movie. And just like that awful horror movie of his' that I mentioned, it is well-made on a technical level, but is lacking so severely in so many places, most notably in that adventurous sense of exploitation filmmaking, that it comes off as rather dislikable.Now I must confess that the first two minutes of the movie got me involved, because it was packed full of references to ""Jaws"" the movie that inspired the original ""Piranha."" Fans like me will be delighted to see that familiar face and spot those references. So the opening had me interested; I told myself that I was in for a worthy remake.Unfortunately, that good feeling only lasted for about another ten minutes.Alexandre Aja is a good director. He knows how to *film* a good-*looking* movie. His earlier film ""Mirrors,"" though absolutely contemptible, was also very well-directed. Unfortunately, both ""Mirrors"" and ""Piranha"" are lacking any real sense of joy and exploitation and they both leave the audience feeling rather empty inside. And if they don't feel empty, they're liable to end up wanting to throw up as they leave the theater. The attacks by the killer fish in the new movie are a lot more gruesome and disturbing than the ones in the 1978 movie. They ought to be; it would be absolutely shameful if they weren't, seeing as how more than thirty years have passed. And Aja was more than willing to be creative with these brutal killings. When the fish attack, it's more than just water being filled with blood. We see bits of flesh being torn off, we see a woman get her scalp ripped from her skull, hindquarters are nipped at (in reference to a scene from the original movie), and so are genital organs....Now that is being just a little too bold. I'd better warn anybody interested in seeing the movie that although most of these attack sequences are goofy and preposterous, some of them are really quite disturbing, such as the last one I mentioned. These moments are not merely suggested; Aja had his special effects department to let loose all of their perversion and banality.And frankly, I hope I never have the displeasure of seeing a chewed-up sex organ floating around in the water again for as long as I live.However, that's just the margin of my complaints. I also have to discredit the filmmakers for the way they continue this unfavorable tradition of bad B-exploitation movies, in which they seem to promote misogynism. Frankly, treating women as sex objects and less-than-human and feeling free to exploit their bodies like gemstones for the perverted members of the audience to gawk at does not amuse me. Again and again throughout the movie, women are stripped naked and examined by the camera. And there is also an incredibly strange lesbian scene shot underwater, which is the most unusual and unsettling love-moment-in-a-void scene since the zero-gravity sex scene of ""Sayonara Jupiter.""Now of course, I am fully aware that this is a popcorn movie and was meant to be. There are some good things about it. Like I mentioned before, it is well-directed, the opening scene of the movie really got me interested and the cameo in that moment is really delightful. There are...mostly good performances. Elisabeth Shue, in particular, is very good as the female sheriff of the lakeside town where all the mayhem takes place. Jerry O'Connell, even though he was just hamming his way to a paycheck, was actually quite good as a pornography director shooting his latest smut on the lake. There's also some good acting from Steven R. McQueen and Ving Rhames. The only bad performance that shocked me was from Christopher Lloyd, who I am sure is regretting his decision to make this movie as we speak. Lloyd is such a brilliant actor, as he's proved many times and he will be brilliant again. But this film is thankfully a small aberration in his career.I say thankfully because I am sure that this remake of ""Piranha"" will be forgotten before long. If it weren't for a particularly disturbing scene I mentioned (I'll let you guess which one I'm talking about) I would have forgotten about it now, two hours after I left the theater. This movie is really short, so not too much time will be wasted on it for those who choose to see it. However, it is ninety minutes of your life and there are much better movies playing right now. If you really feel that you have to see it, I suggest waiting for a DVD rental date. My main problem with this ""Piranha"" was that although it had a similar mentality as the original, it was lacking the exploitation joy and adventure that made that movie so much fun. The joy is replaced with libidinous hunger and a really empty feeling.Oh, and for those who are interested, no, it's not particularly scary....",Piranha 3D
86,MrGKB,Voraciously inferior...,4,20 April 2011,"...in almost every way to the original Dante offering, this latest spawn of the ""Piranha"" franchise (such as it is) flops about like the fish out of water it is, despite its surfeit of boobies, blood, and did I mention boobies? I suppose if I was younger, I might have enjoyed this wretched excess more, but I'm not; I'm far too jaded to forgive the crass commercialism of the project, as well as its lack of genuine humor, which the original had to spare.Instead of beloved genre actors like Bartel, Miller, and Steele, we get a slumming Richard ""Jaws"" Dreyfuss, an equally slumming Ving ""Dawn of the Dead"" Rhames, an apparently washed-up Elizabeth ""Leaving Las Vegas"" Shue, an obnoxious Jerry ""Stand By Me"" O'Connell, various bimbos of little individuality or consequence other than serving as eye-candy and fish bait, two bland and boring leads, Stephen R. ""The Vampire Diaries"" McQueen (who will never in a million years approach his grandfather's charisma) and Jessica ""Gossip Girl"" Szohr, and mercifully brief appearances by Christopher ""Taxi"" Lloyd (shamelessly recycling his ""Back to the Future"" persona) and Eli ""Hostel"" Roth (shamelessly being seen on film again). Virtually nothing in the dim premise or dismal plot makes a lick of sense, and none of the actors bring even a glimmer of believability to their characters. Simply put, it's all a horrendous mess designed to do little more than showcase the above-mentioned boobies and gore, which as also mentioned, are plentiful. I refuse to mention the director, because he's done a few things I've admired, and I refuse to mention the writers, because they deserve little more than derision and shunning.Shot in 2D, adapted to 3D, and who cares?

87,SanteeFats,Adequate,5,7 November 2014,"Okay we have a typical SyFy movie channel film here. Why it is called Piranha is beyond me though. Yes the fish look kind of like piranhas but are suppose to be prehistoric which would not necessarily make them piranha, at least in my opinion. I know nitpicking. Elizabeth Shue is the lead as a semi-small town sheriff with Jerry O'Connell in a smarmy, sleazy role as basically a ""Girls Gone Wild"" film maker with no scruples. He does get his towards the end of the film. He gets a local girl to come on out and be one of the girls. There is a lot of bikinis and eye candy in this movie which helps to make it palatable. As to the released piranha how did they survive if they were trapped in a fault line? Nope not buying it. It is still fairly entertaining. The end is of course rather predictable but what do you expect? Ving Rhames is the deputy and of course he is macho to the end. In his last scene he uses an out board motor to save a lot of the tourists. He does die but heroically. I do wonder why the outboard ran so long without a fuel source but this is a SyFy flick. Mom (Shue) abandons her law enforce duties to go after her kids who are trapped on a sinking boat. Of course all are saved, more or less. The gas tanks that blow kill a crap load of the fish but it turns out they are only babies. Gee does any one smell a sequel????",Piranha 3D

89,cultfilmfan,Piranha 3D,7,1 September 2010,"Piranha 3D is supposedly a remake of the 1978 cult classic Piranha, only in this case it is done in 3D, or at least parts of it are and you get to pay more to watch it with the glasses that the theatre hands out. I did see the original Piranha several years ago. How long, or where I saw it, I do not know and it is irrelevant for this review anyway. As, I have stated in many reviews that I have posted on this website, when I was younger I grew up watching the offbeat and cult films from the 60's, 70's and 80's and found much enjoyment in watching them. When, I saw the advertisements for Piranha 3D it looked to be in the same spirit and style as the 70's cult films I loved so much, that I thought it would be a really fun time to go and see it at the theatre and in 3D no less. For the most part Piranha 3D works on that level. I can honestly not tell you anything from the 1978 version because I simply do not remember anything about it, but it is fairly obvious that in both versions a swarm of piranhas get loose in the lake and wreak havoc on the unsuspecting townsfolk. Only in this version it takes place during Spring Break, so there are a lot of college and university students around who are drinking, partying and more or less making fools of themselves and becoming annoyances to the town and the authorities. To tell you that the piranhas eventually go after them, is not spoiling anything of the movie, it is fairly predictable that way and besides it is kind of an old horror cliché anyway. I enjoyed Piranha 3D because there was a fair amount of humour to it and yes, it was very campy with a lot of the actors overacting and emphasizing their lines to be laughably bad and the film did not take itself too overly seriously, so for the most part it worked. There were in jokes that a lot of film buffs would enjoy and some of it was just plain entertaining and I was enjoying watching it. I guess I am giving it a rating of 7 because as I get older I seem to find that I prefer more serious horror outings than these sillier and more gratuitously gory ones. There are long scenes in Piranha 3D when nothing is happening, but you see people dying in violent and gruesome ways and it just became tedious and a little too much for me. As, I was saying I prefer a more serious type horror film were a lot of violence is not needed and the film relies on a great script and atmosphere to keep your attention and leave you with an overall feeling of dread, mystery, or whatever said film is trying to get across. I still enjoyed Piranha 3D for what it was, but at times the violence was a little too much and not much else was going on and I think there have been better horror films lately that would make this one more of a rental than a must see at the theatre. Worth a rental if you are into this kind of thing, but it is nowhere near a perfect cult film, or homage (see my review of Grindhouse for that), but is still an entertaining diversion and if that is what you are looking for, have fun.",Piranha 3D
90,The_Movie_Cat,"""It took my penis!""",7,19 August 2011,"No film has a right to be this good. Starting with Richard Dreyfuss on a rowing boat this is one that goes beyond just seeing Kelly Brook naked in the water. Key highlight is Jerry O'Connell exploring the outer reaches of over the top... if the viewer is having half as good a time as Jerry is, then they're having a riot. The peak of Jerry's career may in fact be him spitting his dying, blooded breath in someone's face while rueing that he'll never get to see a wet t-shirt competition. His death also raises intriguing points about how we see gender in the cinema, given that his severed penis is amusing, but a woman having her vagina literally eaten is one of the times when it does go a little too far.Other great moments are too many to list, but chief among them include a girl hitting piranhas with a saucepan, a man on a speedbike blowing them out of the water with a shotgun and Ving Rhames' ""Chew on this, motherf***ers!"" This is the film that Mega Shark Versus Giant Octopus SHOULD have been, one that's kind of dreadful and with ropey SFX, but wins out because of it.

91,witster18,One Gigantic Biohazard of a Movie,5,12 January 2011,"I for one cringe when I see those 'crazy / when girls go wild' Spring Break shots. To me it's like a half-naked Jerry Springer Show fresh with boneheads, STD's, and paternity tests. Don't get me wrong - I was crazy at that age too, but now approaching 40, it pretty much just disgusts me to see all that promiscuity, and lack of self-worth. I guess that makes me a bigot, or someone who's just grown up.So needless to say.... When somebody makes a film where all of these party-goers get eaten alive by prehistoric piranha - I'm in.Let's nip this in the bud. 'Piranha' 2010 is an extremely gory film with loads of nudity, and many 'that's just not right' moments. That means parents who strive to keep their children from seeing stuff like this - will not like it. Anyone offended by severed limbs/body parts or floating genitalia, will not like this. This film is definitely for that 20-40 year-old/primarily Male audience who, like myself, have been yearning and waiting for a stupid horror movie to really push the boundaries of an 'R' rating. I must say that one day after watching 'The Last Exorcism' and 'Case 39', 'Piranha' was a pleasant departure. It's an over-the-top, R-rated horror entry that pulls no punches, and IS entertaining for its' demographic.I think the vast majority of the 1 star/2 star/'hated it' reviews are coming from those who were flat-out offended by this films' violence/gore/nudity and truly disgusting moments. Personally, I found the production values to be pretty good. We have a cast that's better than usual for this type of thing, and the CGI isn't all that bad considering there's no other way to show a living prehistoric piranha. There's loads of hot women to be found, and nearly all of them will end up as fish food, or stew bones. I must say that Elizabeth Shue looks pretty freakin' hot, and in that regard, she doesn't play second fiddle to any of the sizzling extra's that Aja hired for their assets alone.The biggest negatives? The plot has no depth and the film is shamefully short.I'd compare this to 'Anaconda' or 'Snakes On a Plane', but 'Piranha' is a touch better than those films. It wasn't nearly as campy as I anticipated, but it also wasn't as funny as I would have liked it to be.'Piranha' is a film that you should know if you can take or not before you press play. If you have any hesitations - DON'T WATCH IT - because chances are it pushes the buttons that you're hoping it won't.That's why I liked it.54/100You'll like it if you liked: Cabin Fever, Godzilla, Re-Animator, and Night of the Creeps.",Piranha 3D

94,DonFishies,"Aja delivers all the blood, camp and boobs you could ever ask for",7,21 August 2010,"Films rarely deliver on the promises of their trailers. Even their synopses can indicate a promise of something the final film has a problem making truly happen. Some movies come close, others fail miserably, and others deliver a different experience entirely. Piranha 3D is the rare film the delivers exactly what the trailers, synopses and every ounce of marketing promises – buckets of blood, campy humour and boobs – lots and lots of boobs.The plot, or what little semblance there is, revolves around the small town of Lake Victoria, which explodes with activity every Spring Break. An earthquake tremor shatters the lake's floor, and lets loose hundreds of prehistoric piranha. And as the trailer suggests, not even local Sheriff Julie Forester (Elisabeth Shue) can stop the mayhem in store for the unlucky college students and residents who venture into the water.Despite a rather threadbare plot, Piranha 3D survives on an alternating scale of maniacal destruction and sheer glee. It is clear from the opening moments of the film that Alexandre Aja is having loads of fun creating this throwback monster movie. And in a year where just about everything seems like a nostalgic reference to films from other decades (specifically the 1980s), Piranha 3D fits right in. It makes no argument about the type of film it is at any point. It knows it is not going to be the next Schindler's List, and it knows it has no chance of even remotely being a ""good movie"". What it strives for, especially if you are the right audience for it, is to be the funnest film of the summer. After all, this is a movie that makes a joke about a severed CGI penis.The film is fun for the sheer fact that Aja does not seem to care about the line between good and bad taste. The aforementioned severed penis aside, there are quite literally hundreds of people who are murdered by these prehistoric killers by the time the film reaches its credits. And Aja just seems to revel in the destruction he creates at every turn. I lost count of how many people perished in one grisly attack near the beach that makes Jaws look about as menacing as Bambi. And somehow, the attacks even vary at how successful they are, and just what gets attacked. Various body parts are ripped out and eaten in detail, and many people end up more mangled than the trailers suggest. Aja has a go-for-broke style that we rarely get a chance to see in modern horror, and pushes the limits of what he can show at any given moment. I have heard there were cuts made to the film, but as it is, I cannot even fathom what could have possibly been chopped out in comparison to what they left in.But the buckets of blood are only the beginning. This is also a film that revels in having bare breasts appear almost every five minutes. Hell, there is an entire five minute underwater ballet-like scene that borders on soft porn. But again, it does not seem like Aja cares. He just wants to revel in how much he can possibly get away with, full frontal nudity and all. It almost feels exploitative at times with just how much these female actresses show off, specifically Kelly Brook and Riley Steele (who is just one of a handful of porn stars who appear in the film). Aja knows his audience, knows his genre, and knows the films that inspired it. It almost comes off like he wanted to ensure he had enough bare breasts so he knew he did not do a disservice to all of those expecting gratuitous amounts of nudity.The film's ultimate success comes from its humour though. With just how ridiculous the film quickly becomes, it never loses sight of its tone and lack of seriousness. It may get extraordinarily gruesome, but it is never serious or horrific enough that you will have trouble laughing at what is going on. The campy one-liners are all very effective, as is the film's nostalgic sensibilities. Even better are the cast members who provide them: Christopher Lloyd as an aquarium owner two steps short of Doc Brown; Jerry O'Connell as a coked out porn producer; Ving Rhames as a bad ass deputy; Eli Roth as the host of a wet t-shirt contest. Everyone brings their A-game, and maintain their deadpan humour throughout. They all look to be having just as much of a blast as Aja is.But there are issues with the film. For one, some of the special effects are lacking. The explicit shots showing the piranha destroying their victims all seem to look awful, as do the piranhas themselves (3D effects do nothing but make them look even worse). The makeup effects are working at full throttle in every single case, but the effects of how these people are being ripped limb from limb seems to have not been too much of a concern for anyone. I realize the campy style of the film, but its style does not excuse its shoddy special effects. The character development is also a little stilted, much like the performance of main star Steven R. McQueen. Had Aja sacrificed the thirty to forty minutes of ""development"" and just added more mayhem, this would not be nearly as much of an issue. But looking at the movie and its style, I doubt Aja was going for perfection here.Granted you are the audience for buckets of blood and gratuitous amounts of nudity, Piranha 3D delivers on all counts. It has some problems and is far from a great movie, but its campy and nostalgic style more than forgives any issue. The film exists solely to be gleefully destructive.

No Story no good script no Character Development whatsoever also has one of the lame-est ending i have ever seen...This movie plays off as a big budget girls gone wild episode with some killer pirhanas thrown in almost as an afterthought...while some of the gore affects were nice and nasty looking..a lot of the Cgi stuff was utter crap..Even the so called 3d wasn't in 3d and it shows just like Clash of the Titans..There is a few good points to the film Elizabeth Shue who did a good job and the Richard Dryfuss Cameo was Clever..however other then that this movie sucks..If they had spent more time working on a good script and giving us Characters that were worth a damn and less time or even no time on nudity and gore the movie would have probably been better...Thank god for the Original being on DVD because i can go and watch that and see what a good film is all about...Again Gore and nudity do not make a movie,Piranha 3D

97,doctorsmoothlove,Piranha,3,24 September 2010,"Exuberance can be one of the worse characteristics someone working towards a goal can have. Filmmaker Andy Miligan, author of several bad films, offers some wisdom on the subject: ""you can't be good at something if you are focused on being good at it"". Mr. Miligan was able to channel this wisdom into more than twenty laughable motion pictures as plot-less as they are misogynistic. In accordance his own words, he would not have achieved this feat had he set out to do it. No one intentionally makes a bad movie.Alexandre Aja could learn something from Miligan. That is to say, he should calm down and determine what kind of film he wants to make. With his new version of Piranha, he did not decide whether to produce a funny movie or a scary one. He tries to do both, and despite his competency at both, the final product is subpar. The tone switches from a typical eco-terror beginning; an earthquake opens a cavern inhabited by deadly prehistoric creatures, to an intermittently comical conclusion. Ancient piranhas emerge and snack on fun-loving spring breakers. The attack sequences are funny. Aja has a delightfully gruesome sense of humor. Someone's body actually breaks into pieces when people attempt to rescue her during the now-famous ten minute bloodbath. Seriously, rent the film and watch that part of it.I wish there were more moments like that one in the film. The advertising campaign emphasized it to counterbalance the other lengthy deficiencies. Nudity abounds (of course all of it is female). A man's CGI penis is devoured. This homage to Regan-era industry standards is particularly odd. This is a 3D killer fish movie. Even audience members at the screening I attended commented on this. In the modern era where people have access to high-speed pornography and musical sensations write songs about their ambivalent sexuality, just adding pornography isn't enough to earn a positive rating.But a bigger problem with Piranha lies with the 3D itself. It was filmed in 2D and converted in post-production. As usual, it results in a loss of color (and coherence). A lot of the attacks are simply too blurry to see. The excessive gore actually works well to mask this problem during the main comedic sequence. During individual attacks, you see a person attacked by a single fish and then a Gray blob. These scenes should be stimulating in some way, but the distracting 3D prohibits even animalistic pleasure at seeing people eaten alive.Piranha may have been Aja's answer to critics' and the public's condemnation of the content of his earlier films. They have been described as joyless celebrations of cruelty without the redemption of having something to say. I haven't seen any of his other works, so I cannot agree that he cannot make a good film. What I can say is his version of Piranha is too boring to recommend.Not Recommended.",Piranha 3D
98,Rickting,An entertaining but disgusting B movie,5,19 May 2014,"Like most people, horror remakes really annoy me. Despite not being particularly successful or regarded, Piranha (likely the best of the Jaws rip-offs) also got the remake treatment. During spring break, a school of prehistoric piranhas attack the partying teens and blood fills the water. Some people try to stop them. That really is about it. Now, Piranha 3D is an acquired taste. It knows what it is. It's a silly B movie filled with unrestrained nudity, gore and general carnage. At least it doesn't try to be Jaws. It manages to nail the right tone and offers various B movie giggles, but the novelty wears off before the end and there are only so many times you can see teenagers getting eaten before you start to feel sorry for them and the film just becomes mean. The film also lacks structure, as it ends with the piranhas getting blown up and a cliff-hanger leading to the (apparently awful) sequel.Most of the cast take it too seriously, but Christopher Lloyd and Richard Dreyfuss have amusing cameo appearances. The film isn't as clever as the original and lacks jokes, so there is a jarring mixture of seriousness and stupidity. However, the film is quite exciting and the characters are likable enough so that you don't want them to get eaten in the first half hour. It's fairly well directed and the script is passable so it's a little better than it had any right to be. The film probably should have aimed a bit higher because although we weren't expecting anything more than guilty pleasure garbage it could have been a bit better cinematically. However, it's certainly high on energy and silliness so it's a very watchable film and the decision to make it 3D, even though I watched it in 2D, was a good idea. To sum up, it's fun and silly and gleefully insane but eventually it runs out of steam.5/10",Piranha 3D
99,davidgee,Alternative title: Free Willy Gets Bitten!,6,25 August 2010,"We all remember There's Something About Mary for the ""hair gel"" scene, don't we?. So I'm pretty sure we're going to remember PIRANHA for the poor guy who gets his dick bitten off by one of the razor-toothed denizens of the deep! There are as many ""Jordanian"" boobs on display as killer fish. Most of the carnage is shot in and under murky water, so the attacks aren't much scarier in 3D than they were in 2D. The gore quotient is pretty high: extras with bite marks, extras with limbs stripped to the bone, extras bitten in half. But the cast member losing his member is definitely THE moment of this piece of ho-hum hokum.A great final shot. It may NOT be safe to go back in the water.",Piranha 3D
100,jordan2240,A tale of two movies,4,28 August 2010,"I've never walked out of a movie before, but actually came close on this one. The first half, or more actually, plays like nothing more than a ""Girls Gone Wild"" video. I understand that's the stage that was being set, but it simply went of way too long. And I found none of the supposedly comic lines to be funny at all. But the fun started when the piranha finally got to the spring-breakers. There was some really cool gore. Yes, there were some obvious references to Jaws, but I thought there could have been some better ones, frankly. If you are a member of the raging-hormone sect, you might enjoy both halves of the film, but for those whose memberships to that group expired a good while ago, your patience will be tried mightily. So, I would recommend waiting until you can get this on Redbox, then skip to the later chapters - or simply skipping this one altogether.",Piranha 3D
101,chicagopoetry,Absolutely Not For The Kids,7,21 August 2010,"I don't know how Piranha 3D got an R rating instead of an NC17 rating. It is quite frankly one of the goriest movies I have ever seen, and I've seen a lot. Unless you want your child to be exposed to a piranha puking out a mangled penis, in 3D no less, leave the children at home. But for horror movie fans this is the real deal. There are plenty of shocks and frights and stuff that will make you jump out of your seat. The problem with 3D films is that if you don't see it on a really big screen, the effects don't deliver. The theater I saw Piranha 3D in had two bright exit signs to either side of the screen that completely kept me from being able to concentrate on the 3D effects. I finally changed seats to the second row, where I sat low in my seat and held my 3D glasses close to my face, and then I really enjoyed the effects. And there are some good ones too, a few of which not involving bloody skeletal limbs and naked breasts. This is a really well made movie with acting that isn't half bad with enough action that there isn't really any need for a plot. The killer piranhas are in the lake and the sheriff must save the day. For those who get a kick out of taking gore to the extreme, this one is not to be missed. For the faint of heart or for anyone looking for something more than prehistoric piranhas chomping on human flesh, you might want to check out that 3D dance flick instead.",Piranha 3D

The conversion introduces annoying artifacts but it's still worth watching in 3D to add to the insanity. Definitely the best piranha movie. Nude 3D swimming.

104,TheExpatriate700,"It's No Jaws, But It'll More Than Do",7,3 January 2012,"Piranha 3D is a great creature feature that takes too long to start, but goes into overdrive once it does. It shares the goofy spirit of the original Piranha, but boosts the gore up to a thousand. It contains what is arguably the bloodiest ten minutes I have seen in a mainstream film.The plot is pretty much standard for this type of film. An earthquake opens an underwater prehistoric cavern, letting loose a horde of ferocious, two million year old piranha. A stalwart sheriff, played by Elizabeth Shue, teams up with a scientist in order to take on the monsters. Meanwhile, a sleazy video producer is in town for Spring Break, hoping to talk drunken coeds into disrobing for the cameras.The first hour or so does not seem to offer much beyond this tired premise. However, when the piranhas finally go on their inevitable beach rampage, the film goes into high gear. The bloodshed is truly through the roof, with more gore than a dozen Friday the 13th films. Furthermore, the filmmakers do not limit themselves to the usual chew 'em up killings, with a few surprise deaths from stray machinery during the flight from the lake. The death toll racks up well into the hundreds. Indeed, when the film was over I looked at the DVD in awe, wondering if I had been lucky enough to get an unrated edition in an R- rated package.Although the first two acts are devoted largely to rote exposition and T&A, the film is well worth seeing for the attack scenes and over the top gore. It should be on every gore hound's to see list.",Piranha 3D
105,TheEmulator23,"Mildly fun, took too long to get fun.",5,12 January 2011,"This was an OK film. I knew what I was in for, yet you go to see lots of Piranhas eat people & watch all the cool ways to kill them. Unfortunately they had to mess w/trying to have some semblance of a plot which was pointless. We didn't care about the boy not admitting he's in love w/the girl. WHO CARES? The 1st hour is basically a complete waste. However once you get over the boring 1st hour, the last 1/3 is pretty fun. I think they should have had more Kelly Brook of course & more Jerry O'Connell playing the complete douche-bag. He plays it well & seems to be having fun w/it too. The best thing is that although the film didn't too to well here in the states, it cost $24 mil only made $25. It made an extra $54 mil worldwide so it was quite a success. So now in the sequel maybe they will have learned to just really go for it in ""Piranha 3DD."" Here's hoping!",Piranha 3D
106,Cinema_Fan,Popping-out for a bite to eat?,6,12 May 2011,"Piranha, shot in 2D then transferred into the 3D format also, isn't that bad a movie, while never going to blow the lid off the summer blockbuster market, it speaks volumes in the style of the old and traditional likes of the Seventies exploitation, creature feature B-movie horror genre.This snappy tale of a mixture of the hedonistic and the macabre is essentially a black comedy, and when the party is in full swing has plenty of bite and appetite for the grotesque. With a cast here that are certainly not going to propel this feature into the depths of A-list notability, but with Ms. Shue and Ving Rhames as leads, it, too, is not going to be a flat and shallow experience, throwing in the likes of Richard Dreyfuss and Christopher Lloyd too gives the film a little street-credit too.Lake Victoria's annual spring party by some 50,000 young revellers' is about to turn into a feeding frenzy with prehistoric hunger-pains. Released from their two million year long sleep, with deadly consequence, thousands upon thousands of flesh-eating piranha are set lose into Lake Victoria. It's a feeding ground of blood, screams and boobs.Overall, it is a decent popcorn matinée movie that should not be taken too seriously, Piranha can be a tense and horrific sight, with extreme prosthetic makeup to deepen the experience of baited-breath and razor teeth chaos. Both 2D and 3D do the trick as does its CGI, showing us that Alexandre Aja can deliver, in places, a true nasty, creature feature and with an added zest of humour and parody has brought the Seventies, like these little nippers, kicking and screaming into the 21st Century.",Piranha 3D
107,jhpstrydom,"Blood, guts and boobs but not really all that good.",6,8 March 2011,"When I heard about a new monster fish movie getting a theatrical release I was looking forward to seeing it but when I found out it was actually a remake then I reckoned its not an original concept so best not get my hopes up, when I finally saw PIRANHA it was actually not really something I would go out on a limb to recommend.Basically the plot has been done before about a dozen times only this plot is a whole lot thinner than most, the characters are not really likable but also not extremely dis likable but you never really care about any of them and there is virtually zero suspense in this film because for the majority of the film you can tell what's going to happen next.Probably the only good part about it would be the gore because there is plenty of gore to satisfy an entire clan of gore hounds and there is also a reasonable supply of naked women.To be honest I expected a more exciting film instead its mainly a gore fest that displays the occasional full frontal female nude shot, considering also I only saw the 2D version of the film the CGI piranhas look really cheaply made, the effects probably looked better in the 3D version but based on the 2D version if this film was able to get a theatrical release then some the SyFy channel's man eater films shouldn't have a problem going theatrical either.",Piranha 3D
108,Meven_Stoffat,"Oh, shut up guys and have some fun for once!",7,21 January 2011,"Was this movie bad? Yes. Was it poorly written and exaggerated to the extreme? Yes. So why do I love this movie? Because it's fun.After two good movies (Inception and The Expendables) and long laundry list of disappointments (Salt, The Last Airbender), Piranha ends the summer movie season on a 3D bang. It is the film you kinda wish you didn't love after seeing as it's exaggerated to the extreme and generic as hell, but you still love it since it managed to be entertaining as all hell.The 3D is indeed post converted (*dramatic music*) but fear not, for a post conversion it's actually really good. Unlike Alice In Wonderland where the screen got all blurry in the action-packed scenes, and the Last Airbender, a distorted-picture film that required you wear a pair of tinted glasses to ""un-blur"" the image. Actually I won't lie, this is the best conversion I've ever seen. A lot of the ""pop out"" effects work (the puke on the boat, the taser in the beginning) and the image doesn't look flat.The plot is quite straightforward- a young teen disobeys his mother's rules to watch over his young sister and her friend, and goes off with a young girl and a porn site owner on a boat, to film some porn. However, a prehistoric breed of Piranha awakens and takes over the lake, with very gory results. Of course, nothing Oscar worthy, but that's the point.This film is one bad film- way too over the top, horrible acting, plot holes galore- but it's so hilarious and well aware of it, and it became fun to watch for that reason. It's provided some of the most entertainment of any film 2010. And in 3D, to add a nice campy touch too. Overall it's a very fun film, and worth seeing it. Just realize it's a B flick nothing more, and it was meant to be awful, and you will have fun!",Piranha 3D
109,mnpollio,Proof of the decline of Western civilization,1,26 October 2010,"Absolute dreck, which mysteriously managed to gain a myriad of critical accolades while rising to a far from impressive number 8 at the US box office. It has been a long time since we have gotten a fun Jaws-inspired rip-off, this does not qualify. The film is a wart on the butt of the original Jaws and fails to even come within miles of Jaws 2 or the original Piranha, both of which managed to be fun and suspenseful. An earthquake opens up a fissure to an underground cave housing deadly prehistoric piranha just shy of a Spring Break extravaganza. I love good trash or guilty pleasures and Piranha 3-D would certainly seem to fall within those parameters. It is completely up front about being trash, which I respect, but it also arrives acting like it is too-cool-for-the-room. In other words, it makes the mistake of believing in advance that it is great watchable trash...it is mistaken. Instead of crafting something fun and suspenseful from the set-up, director Aja has instead vomited forth a film so brutally repellent and disgusting as to defy belief. After a while, the gore literally ceases to have any impact. Aja has little interest in the characters populating his landscape of blood and fails to even make them ""types"" that anyone can be concerned about before they meet their gruesome fates. We have no concern for Sheriff Elisabeth Shue, scientist Adam Scott or any vested interest in whether Shue's three offspring will survive the onslaught. The visual effects range from adequate to clumsy, and the underwater 3-D effects are murky - proof positive that the film was converted rather than filmed expressly for 3-D. If character development is non-existent than suspense/excitement follows it down the same hole. The dialog consists of either screaming, a scientist-type pontificating a wild theory, or some variation of ""Let's get out of here"" or ""Look out"". Then again, it only has to function as little more than a bridging device between the next gore scene or the next boob shot. The film is awash in a ocean of boobs. There are bare breasts to right, to the left and storming the camera at every opportunity. Apparently, filmmakers forgot that their target audience would probably be dragging their girlfriends to this epic, so male skin is at a minimum. The film's ""highlight"" or nadir, depending on your view, is a roughly 10-minute orgy of violence with various partiers being devoured, skewered, ground up in propellers, torn apart, beheaded, etc., preferably women who somehow manage to lose their tops prior to being disemboweled. The film's idea of comedy is having Jerry O'Connell as a Girls Gone Wild-type sleaze merchant who gets his privates gnawed off on camera - oh the hilarity! The acting is not terrible. Perhaps Steven R. McQueen will have the luck of his grandfather after The Blob and go on to something better. Pity poor Shue, Richard Dreyfuss, Ving Rhames, Christopher Lloyd, et al., whose careers have apparently bottomed out to include chum like this as an option. Kelly Brook is lovely and seems classier than the film surrounding her, so no wonder Aja decides to destroy her physically near the climax, but not before graphically denuding her for the gratification of the sweaty adolescents in the audience. Then again, this is no surprise for a film that seems to view the entire human race as little more than bare boobs and geysers of gore. A truly disheartening experience and indefensible on any level.",Piranha 3D
110,Ryan_MYeah,"It's tasteless, and foolish, but that's exactly the point. An overall fun movie.",6,9 September 2010,"People have been giving this movie enthusiastic reviews, calling it the big guilty pleasure movie of 2010, and they're right. The film is far from perfect, it's stupid, but it is FUN.A town sheriff (Played by Elizabeth Shue) is investigating the source of a recently found dead body, that turns out to be the nesting grounds for a species of vicious piranhas thought to be completely extinct several million years ago, this leads her, and a group of others to try and clear the local beach of wayward teens celebrating Spring Break, and on top of that, her son Jake (Played by Steven McQueen) is out in the ocean helping a pornographer (Played by Jerry O'Connell) film scenes for his upcoming project. This leads the movie to nudity every two to ten minutes, flying body parts, masses of blood, gimmicky 3D, and Ving Rhames chopping those mother ------s up with a boat engine. Sold yet? The film is essentially a group of thirds. One third of the film is basically a soft core porno masked by the films other two thirds, a ridiculously fun and over the top Hollywood blood fest. It uses a lot of standard B horror movie clichés, and seizes every opportunity to place as much tasteless nudity into the film as humanly possible. The story may be a little odd at times, but it sure is fun.The cast is kind of hit and miss, mostly hit. Elizabeth Shue was badass as her character, sheriff Julie Forrester. Steven McQueen actually helps carry the film pretty well. And there's always help from Adam Scott, Ving Rhames, and Jerry O'Connell (Playing an obvious parody of ""Girls Gone Wild"" producer Joe Francis). Then there's the cameos, which include Richard Dreyfus, Eli Roth, and ever the scene stealer, Christopher Lloyd.The visual side of the movie could potentially prove to be a distracting one. The film (Which was converted to 3D) is filled to the brim with gimmicks, which do grow pretty tiresome over time, and the effects animation of the piranhas can be a little underwhelming at times, but for the most part, it's not bad.In the movie's defense, it COMPLETELY knows it's not meant to be taken seriously.

112,doorsscorpywag,Piranha don't eat c#ck,1,7 October 2010,Not the worst movie ever made but one of the many that fall into the 1* is too much category. Sort of a Darwin Awards lake where the stupid offspring of rich people are sent to pass a rite of passage that involves surviving being slaughtered by fish that seem to be able to growl underwater. Those that survive run the country. Hardly a comedy as there are not a lot of laughs as only very immature 12 year olds would snigger as morons are shredded by the growling fish. Not really a horror as it was just a series of rather stupid death scenes that whilst gory were very boring. The CGI was adequate ....just....the acting....there was none. The characters were all idiots so it was impossible to care who lived or died. Not one scene that was tense or funny. Lots of nudity to keep 12 year olds with no Internet access happy and lots of bloody death in stupid ways to keep morons happy. But a story that a monkey would disown directed so badly Alan Smithee would be embarrassed to have his name on it and filled with acting a tree would be ashamed of. One interesting thing I did learn from this tripe was Piranha don't eat c#ck which was something Discovery omitted to mention.,Piranha 3D

114,Jerique,Trailers lie sometimes...,3,4 September 2010,"I couldn't go see Scott Pilgrim for the third time so instead, I chose to see Piranha and it wasn't showing 2D, so I saw the 3D form. I am not too happy with my decision to see it. Trailers and all, will make you believe this story is driven intensely and has some scares, thrills and an overall memorable, captive film. Not the case, folks.I was able to predict adult film star, Ashlynn Brooke's death as not to occur until we got a glimpse of her naked breasts, and I was right. I make mention to this because it's the highlight of the film. The trailers ask, ""how fast can you swim?"" Well, it's quite an redundant question, to say the least, when you watch the film and realize there's never a chance to swim. As it turns out, the piranhas only do sneak attacks.As the movie progresses, the piranhas continuously devouring their prey gets repetitive and boring. The history of the species and the plot is quite weak. Main characters are played by basically no-name actors and the story kinda sits around to find out what it will do next at times. It's as if the writers were stumped on how to continue the story at times. As far as the scares, it's more accurate to call them ""thrills"" because as far as I could tell, there are no scare-scenes. Unless, you've never been to a movie like this.3D effects were minimal and what was seen was not very impressive. As the movie opens a guy catches a fish and dangles in the open screen, which then seems as if the fish is in the theater with you. The best 3D effect was the naked bodies of the two ""wild, wild"" girls underwater making out. It seems (using 3D effects) that they are floating so close to you, you could reach out and grab them.What I will say is great about Piranha is the make-up and creature effects. Scenes of gore were some of the most grotesque I've ever seen. I was actually cringing at some of the things shown. Aside from that, this film is not much better than any of horror remakes/reboots that have come along the past few years. I did enjoy seeing Gianna Michaels and Ashlynn Brooke though, as they are two of my most favourite adult stars. I will tell you to avoid this movie, but if you have to choose between this and Vampires Suck, and you choose the latter, you're a lost cause and can't be saved. It's a decent entertaining movie.",Piranha 3D
115,basrutten,Third rate torture porn that wouldn't have even made it to the cinema without 3D hype,3,11 September 2010,"Oh my, where to begin? When you go to a movie like this, you know you aren't gonna get anything Oscar-worthy, but at least creature movies like this can contain funny characters, great one-liners, a lot of gore, some good scares, and amusing deaths.Piranha 3D delivers on exactly one of these aspects: it contains tons and tons of gore. But in all honesty, its not very original gore (nearly everything has been done before) and most of its crosses the line into plain tasteless nastiness.What's even worse is that the director didn't even try to come up with a story or characters to tie the gore together. Piranha 3D is clearly the laziest execution of this kind of movie to date: there are literally no characters, no story, no memorably quotes, no good jokes, nothing. It's just gore interleaved with nudity.And then there's the 3D, which is yet again a shoddy 2.5D post-production job, which alternates between looking like a big blurry mess and a freak show of wrong proportions, lack of depth, and people and structures that look like miniatures. James Cameron was right, 3D when done like this doesn't add anything and I hope they stop making stuff like this and do 3D properly, if at all.It boggles the mind that this movie has garnered so much positive press. There is nothing wrong with this kind of movie, in fact I enjoy most of the movies in this genre, but this is easily one of the most lazy and just plain awful executions of the campy horror template in recent history.",Piranha 3D

No, I didn't make love to Kelly Brook, but close enough... kidding. I... laughed... my as* off I found it on the floor after the film... I just couldn't believe what a hell I just saw! This film is really fun, OK, it is incredibly dumb, but hysterically funny! It's just outrageous, in a positive way. It is a good popcorn movie, and I fell sorry for watching it at home in 2D, this should be watched in the movies with 3D glasses on. For some, it is a remake of Joe Dante's Piranha (1978), and for others it is a third film, but I don't care, as long as it got G&G! That stands for gore and girls! No, really this is a great family/friend film, after you all got drunk at the party, and it's time to sit down, relax, please play this film if you have it! You'll laugh so hard that your intestines will burst! Man... In next life, I wanna be a piranha, just to get a chance to eat some fine chick's a** and pu**y! OK, enough jokes... This is one of these films that you don't need to pay attention to anything, just turn off your brain and enjoy it... don't talk, don't think, just relax and enjoy the show, it's like a freaking' stand up show.Actors were fine on the field (water), Richard Dreyfuss and Christopher Lloyd were a wonderful surprise here! Love them both! Elizabeth Shue as a tough chick sheriff, she reminded me of Radha Mitchel from ""Pitch Black""...in a way. Her son Steven R McQueen, a cute, next door boy hero, a girlfriend of leading hero wannabe Jessica Szohr, Ving Rhames, a bada** dude, with a booming voice... classic, love it, Eli Roth made a cameo as a DJ speaker for hot booty and breasts chicks... heh, that was cool! Kelly Brook, well, they didn't bring her on the film because she is smart... no need to talk about her, it is obvious enough, she is one of the reasons for me to become a piranha. Dina Meyer, once a well known lovely actress appeared in the film for a short time, too bad... whatever happened to her? No matter... but Jerry O'Connell, I have never took this guy for serious, I have seen perhaps... two of his films, never took him for some good, serious actor, well, his performances were nothing special, but here... he convinced me!

It's an all-time cult classic that has been remade before. I knew full well that it was going to be rated R for blood and gore because piranhas simply tear flesh off in seconds. What I didn't know was that it was going to have nudity. Lots of it. Okay...this was not in the original movie.Apparently, this movie couldn't decide whether it's a monster movie or a pornographic film. While it's certainly hot, half the movie is nothing but girls showing off their breasts and as a result the plot suffers severely from all this. This coupled with some lame characters is why this film is a major letdown. Plus, the movie has a rather laughable ending.The movie does have some redeeming factors. The piranhas themselves put Jaws to shame. They've killed more people in one movie then any slasher villain could ever dream about. It's like someone injected each fish with fifty gallons of steroids! The deaths are absolutely gruesome, some of the most intense I have ever seen in a movie. Christopher Lloyd is in it as a scientist, which is pretty cool, but he has a small role. Richard Dreyfuss has a cool cameo singing an all too familiar song from ""Jaws."" I also love the scene where this cop takes a speedboat's propellers and goes about shredding the piranhas with it. Absolutely awesome.This is a movie that could have been done better. The filmmakers didn't take this very seriously, which is very disappointing. Surprisingly, Piranha 3D is getting a sequel (unsurprisingly because of the excessive nudity) so I wonder how that's gonna turn out?

An updated version for the NEW AGE crowd. New Age music crowds the soundtrack and this film is NOT FOR KIDS. The plot was dumb as could be. A underwater tremor causes a shift in a lake and breaks apart the rock base unleashing thought to be extinct pre historic Piranha. This happens of course during Spring Break where Booze, Boobs and Dumb young adults frolic. There really was absolute NO horror in this film, more comedy I would gather. A lot of blood and half ripped open men and women splash in the water while the fish attack.

I watched 'Piranha' on DVD; when experiencing it in 3D, I guess you'd be at risk of a heart attack! However, there must also be some criticism: this film's plot is too simple to be good. Just place your piranha-disaster in a recognizable USA-neighborhood of holiday & leisure, and you can't go wrong. Especially when you polish this neighborhood up with lots of more or less naked young women.You may know that piranha-fish originate from the Amazon-river in South America. Living the hot & moist climate from this part of the world. Another characteristic: piranha's do not only eat themselves, they are also catch-ed for consumption.I once was at the local market at Iquitos, Peru's main city in the Amazone-area east of its Andes-mountains. Located fairly close to the wells of the Amazon-river. On this market piranha-fish were widely for sale, and I was informed that they taste well. Out of curiosity, I stuck my finger into one of these dead piranha's mouth. And yes: feeling its teeth was like touching a series of razor blades.",Piranha 3D
120,rhinocerosfive-1,For the Demographic Too Shy to Murder Its Own Girls,5,22 August 2010,"In the minus column: A hackneyed plot. Banal dialogue. Perfunctory characters. Action without consequence. Good actors in bad roles. Bad actors in bad roles, especially many annoying performers who do not die early enough, or who do not die at all, including two dull children whose only purpose in the film is to be eaten by piranha, and who are not. Plus a weak story as an excuse for various types of titillation.The pluses: Various types of titillation, including the violent deaths of Eli Roth and Jerry O'Connell. Come on. That's some big pluses.This movie more or less performs its primary directive, which is to teach young boys how to masturbate to softcore sex while simultaneously enjoying hardcore violence. Or the other way around, maybe; does it matter? At least ""Piranha 3D"" is unpretentious in the structure department. It doesn't bother making its fish expert a scientist, but rather a guy played by a guy who used to play a scientist. On one level, that's lazy filmmaking. On another, though, it's pretty efficient shorthand.However, the movie does make the strange choice of looking down upon a character whose job is to make pornography. Since this movie's job is to be pornography, I'm confused. Is that a metaphysical statement? Is this creation talking back to its maker? Or is it just unselfconscious enough not to notice that it contains all the dirty stuff its villain wants us to see? Besides all that, the movie offers up several kinds of wish fulfillment: underdog heroism; blonde girls who would never sleep with you getting their hair caught in outboard motors; and the greatest gift of all, that it is soon over.",Piranha 3D
121,freaky_dave,"Tasteless, but in a good way",7,22 August 2010,"Piranha 3D is a tasteless and extremely disgusting movie that makes fun of the typical stereotypes that go with college students on spring break and has a lot of fun with it. I actually enjoyed the movie. Many of the actors play their parts tongue in cheek, with Jerry O Connell standing out the most.Alexander Aja, who directed, has had some hits and misses with horror movies, but with Piranha 3D he has a small hit that has a good chance of becoming a cult favorite once it goes to video after its theater run. THis movie was funny and creepy disgusting all together. Some directors can't do both, but Aja succeeds.Far from a great movie, but did anybody really expect a movie with such a title to be an academy award winner, Piranha 3D manages to succeed where many such movies have failed.

I can't complain about the quality of the nudity, but I think I ought to say that the quantity of the close-ups of cleavage and other parts was overdone (in the same excessive compulsiveness as Ed Wood and HG Lewis). Some movies have comic relief, this had anatomic relief. Regarding the gore and violence, I can't say that it was repulsive necessarily (actually, funny mostly), but what did repel me was a particular coward in a motorboat with no regard for human life or his own integrity. Please don't lecture me that it was a snapshot of human nature, and that we all have that capacity - that's a false flag in order to ignore what being human is really about. I have to say now that Aja seemed somewhat hostile to his audience. There is no other reason for him to include what I consider a blatant middle finger by having a piranha burp out a half-eaten penis into my face in 3D. On the flip side, it was nice to see the arrogant Richard Dreyfuss get his, which I think was also Aja's aim. I am torn (limb from limb) on this movie - on the one hand, it's a brilliant parody of Jaws, and on the other hand it is a heavy-handed entry into gross-out cinema.",Piranha 3D

I have always loved underwater horror movies ever since I've seen the all time classic Jaws (1975).The story is that there has been an underwater earthquake which has unleashed prehistoric piranhas. These piranhas were supposed to be extinct 2 million years ago but their habitat was 200 feet underground of the sea all along. The rest of the story is all about stupid teenagers who can't act and we don't care about trying to avoid turning into fish food. This kind of story is a much better idea because Piranhas are generally not that aggressive.The movie was bashed even before it was released because most people thought it was a cheesy movie with bad CGI but I loved every minute of it because it was so entertaining; fun, very relentless and I had a really good time watching it.Piranha 3D is not a masterpiece or is going to the Oscars (unless it is nominated for the best movie with flesh getting peeled off the bones) it is just a fun popcorn movie that has more than enough to keep you entertained.If you are the kind of person that likes gore or nudity or both then check this movie out. Personally I enjoy gore and also if you liked Snakes on a Plane.Overall Horror & Thriller are my favourite genders which Piranha is and after a long time there is an underwater horror movie that can be seen on the big screen since not every movie is the kind that can be viewed on the cinema.",Piranha 3D

Dreyfuss opens the movie playing a old dude just chilling on a lake catching some fish along with a few cold ones when a earth tremor sends a school of prehistoric piranha free in to a busy spring break packed lake. We then get the police trying to get people ala Jaws out of the water but its always too late before these mean little fishies with the massive chompers have their all you can eat buffet! Not to post any spoilers but Jerry Oconnell who plays a girls gone wild type director in this loses a little more then he would like courtesy of the piranha, some of him the piranha actually spit out into the camera something that must've looked great to all the people that actually got to take this film in at the theatre.

Per usual the characters were bad, what did you expect with a title like Piranha 3D. I am amazed this film made it by with an R-rating, what does that say about cinema these days. I like gore, don't get me wrong, but here it is beyond any gore fest i've ever scene, more so than planet terror and borderline Dead alive. If you want to see young kids getting butchered, ripped apart and brutalized this is the film for you. By no means the worst film I have ever seen, but it sure is one of the most violent. I've said it before and I'll say it again, I can't believe people would do this for money, but they also do it when they are not getting paid, which is just sad. At least this film isn't disturbing.

Acting, photography, direction, graphics and location are the highlights of the film that had sustained the thrill all across the film with ease. I wonder why people rated an average of 5.4., but I am damn sure they had not watched the uncut version of the same. I am from India, and this particular movie was featured in one of the Indian television, and due to the censorship rules, there were hell lot of cuts. I am okay if the naked scenes are cut, but even the horrifying scenes are cut to the huge extent. It was just disappointing to watch the censored version, and I would have easily given the same rating as you guys had given.And later i suspected hence, i watched the uncut version of the same, and I really loved it. For me, i would rate this movie 10/10, as it is a rare thriller movie of this typicality and the horrifying scenes made me look real.I would like to take an opportunity to speak my heart over here regarding the censorship in India.
I was getting bored, and i had called my subscriber operator ""Airtel"" to enable all English HD movies. (HD is the max in india. Full-HD/4K isn't out there in satellite channels yet :(). So, i was enjoying the quality of the movies, but when I started watching this movie, I realized and measured how much duration of the movie was cut, and to my shocking they have cut 17minutes from the original, and this really tossed my temperament. So, I request people not to censor the unnecessary stuff, or atleast provide an option to the consumer to choose uncut versions. Because if you edit, the originality of the movie is completely lost, and you happen to see all together a different movie, and the experience is entirely spoiled. See, this is a pure horror film, and how could one restrict the scenes to be displayed?? Anyways the ceritificate of the movie is anyways displayed, so it should be upto the families to decide which movie to be shown to their kids.Hence, i have decided to deactivate my English HD pack from my TV, as it really does not make sense to watch censored versions. I really love and appreciate movies, so I am really serious about this matter. And charging money from the consumer for this not so qualitative entertainment is not right.ALL Guys who ever is reading, kindly let me know are there any APPS such as NETFLEX or Amazon Prime, who shows the uncut version of the same?

Okay? Well anyways, you can't go 10 minutes without seeing boobs, a butt, or someone doing something sexual. I realize this seems to be the staple for the newer low budget monster flicks like this, but give it a break.

Although some attacks are CGI, the make-up effects on wounds and bodies is brilliant.As for the 3-D, frankly it is used to better effect here than it was in Avatar. I still think it is a gimmick but it is used very well here. Perhaps horror type movies are where film-makers might find the best use for 3-D in future.It's not a movie that people will consider one of the best of the year, but from it's start till the final scene, Piranha 3-D is one of the most entertaining movies of the year.",Piranha 3D

Piranha is a really bad movie; it's mostly just a gore and soft-porn show. First, everyone should know before they see this movie that Richard Dreyfus is in it for all of about 2 and 1/2 minutes. They must have paid him a lot of money to get his name attached to this mess. Vingh Rhames is in it a bit longer, maybe 7 or 8 minutes, maybe less, yet these two are the featured actors in the flick. Within the first several minutes of the film, we wait eagerly for the murderous fish to quickly dispatch the seedy and obnoxious characters we are introduced to, but at 88 minutes you know this will take too long.

The bottle he puts down falls into the water, and sinks to the bottom of the lake. When bottle gets to the bottom, there is a earthquake opening a cavern on the bottom of the lake.While the cavern finishes opening up, Dreyfuss realized that the water is turning into a spiral sucking his boat backwards into the lake. He starts to paddle as fast as he can when looking down the water spiral he sees the baby piranhas coming up towards him.He does not paddle fast enough and boat tips over, and he falls in to be attacked and eatin alive.

There was a good party atmosphere in this movie with wanton, beer-driven, music-driven and ultimately ""partay"" driven young people on spring break. This aspect of the movie could have, I believe, stood on it's own without those mean, toothsome, party crashers butting in. I guess even piranhas know a good party when they see one.The movie has the same basic premise as most films of this genre of horror, most notably Jaws. The threat in the water occurs during a big event that draws a lot of visitors to the water. There are people who know whats going on before everyone else; and who recognize the potential difficulty of trying to stop a profitable event. The proverbial sh!t has to hit the fan before direct action can be taken. You know the deal.Along with the gore there is some nudity that maybe I should alert you about in case you neither like gore or nudity, or like both; or like one, but not the other.

Those bad boys find their way to the surface just in time for Lake Victoria's annual Spring Break festivities, where the town is overrun by thousands of drunken half naked college students.

Elisabeth Shue (of ""Adventures in Babysitting"" fame) plays Lake Victoria's single-Mom sheriff, whose kids of course find themselves in mortal danger and require last minute rescue, and the rest of the cast is filled out by such stalwarts as Jerry O'Connell (""Sliders"") as a sleazy ""Girls Gone Wild"" style porn kingpin whose plans to shoot a Spring Break Special video on the lake go horribly awry thanks to the arrival of the hungry fishies. Ving Rhames turns up as a deputy sheriff, and Richard (""Jaws"") Dreyfuss and Christopher (""Back to the Future"") Lloyd also appear in brief stunt-casting cameos.But the real stars here are the piranhas, of course, and they're a mean looking bunch, all teeth and scales and spikes and capable of skeletonizing a drunken bikini babe within seconds. When the massive school of piranhas attack the Spring Break beach party the carnage is impressive to say the least. Gorehounds will applaud every single disgusting moment of it (especially one particularly nasty bit involving a certain, shall we say, ""part"" of Jerry O'Connell, which I can honestly say I've never seen in a movie before).Technically I'd say ""Piranha"" 2010 isn't a ""remake"" of the 1978 film, rather it's an homage or a continuation on the same theme. Whatever you want to call it, ""Piranha"" is a blood soaked good time that carries on the exploitation tradition of the '70s and '80s most admirably. Will the inevitable sequel resurrect the piranha/flying fish crossbreeds from 1983's semi-legendary ""Piranha II: The Spawning?"" We can only hope!",Piranha 3D

I felt like I had been watching two different movies all at once, one was about hungry killer fishes and another one was about naked sexy girls. From the beginning, I do not expect much from thiz no-need-remake. But for the result, the movie has not only falls into B-Class movie, but thiz one definitely becomes what I called C-Class movie. There is no innovation and every single aspect is lack of creativity. It's all about gore and nudity with mediocre Actors such as Elisabeth Shue, Ving Rhames, Christopher Lloyd, Steven R. McQueen and ""My Secret Identity"" (1988-1991) star, Jerry O'Connell. Plus cameo appearances from Eli Roth and Richard Dreyfuss. Nobody shines in thiz movie, especially O'Connell who is extremely annoying. The movie is directed by slash movie specialist, Alexandre Aja. Aja is the man behind ""Mirrors"" (2008) and the remake of ""The Hills Have Eyes"" (2006). The story is extremely awful. There is nothing worth watching, except a group of people are having party and suddenly eaten by fish. Everything is completely rip-off from similar genre like ""Jaws"" quadrilogy (1975-1987) and even the original ""Piranha"" (1978). One thing is for sure, do not take your children to see thiz movie.

142,MovieProductions,Exactly what you'd expect it to be,7,11 January 2011,"*** out of (****)Piranha 3D is not a pleasant surprise, aside from quality, in any way, shape, or form. You get exactly what you bargained for. Boobs, blood, 3D. It can't get any simpler than that. Throw in a hysterical Dreyfuss cameo, a few other A-listers, and you have a good time on your hands. This is one over-the-top vehicle so proceed with caution. A devoured penis. Two fully nude women acting as mermaids. 80,000 gallons of blood. Dreyfuss reprising his famous tune. If all this doesn't pique your interest or quench your thirst, then you should stay away as disappointment will inevitably pursue. While this a highly flawed picture that aims at the lowest common denominator at nearly every account, those are exactly it's intentions and it's the right kind of bad. The entertaining, over-the-top-kind-of-fun way. It's that time again. Those hormonal spring breakers are out there dancing every ounce of their body off, drinking liquor like water, and making the crudest remarks toward women. Well, the fun stops there. After a tremor breaks open in Lake Victoria, it releases hundreds of Piranha, killing tons of young adults. Meanwhile, Jake Forester is on baby sitting duty because he has to look after his younger sister and brother while his mother is out there kicking some teenage butt as the Sheriff. Forester decides to ditch his tedious task and hops on the infamous ""Wild Wild Girls"" boat with his scantily clad crew. Unfortunately, the Piranha are in on them too.First off, we all know the performances in Piranha don't fit the phrases or words ""heart- warming"", ""Oscar-worthy"", and ""authentic"". And it clearly shows. However, the performances aren't abysmal either. Likewise, they're actually decent. Dreyfuss is his usual hip self, Shue kicks some behind, Rhames is one cool guy, Derrick is the jerk you love to hate, and Jake is the typical outcast. Also, the script isn't half bad. The movie has a nice dose of humor without it becoming self-parody, the jokes pack a punch, the situations are pretty realistic, and the characters are decently written. Furthermore, the direction is gnarly. The pace is nearly break-neck, the movie is nicely edited, and the movie knows what it is.Now, the reason why everyone is lined up: Gratuitous blood, nudity, and 3D. And honestly, those aforementioned factors don't disappoint. Not only do they not disappoint, but at times, they can become overly-excessive. For nudity, you never once see an ""A"" or ""B"" cup, so perverted guys, don't cry. For the gorehounds, like myself, this movie is probably the bloodiest of them all, and 3D junkies, things are flying out at you like there's no tomorrow and the depth is great.Overall, Piranha 3D is just fun popcorn shlock. Take it or leave it. How can you possibly get disappointed when you know what to expect exactly going in? Granted, I didn't expect so much skin considering the ads made it out to be a pure-Piranha action extravaganza, but I could see past that and I know it's one of the movie's main selling points. Also, some commented on the horribly artificial CGI fish and I thought, as far as CGI goes, it wasn't too bad. We don't have a ""Transformers"" on our hands, but we don't have a cheesy late-night Sci- Fy channel film either. All in all, I like this movie. There's not a whole bunch of surprises and this isn't the best on the market, but shoot, for all the serious dramas trying to outdo another in quality, it's refreshing to see one that doesn't try so hard and has fun with what its doing.On a side note: I viewed Piranha 3D with my HD 3D setup and maybe it was only a theatrical problem, but the 3D I saw was great. The colors were never darkened, and they actually popped, there was a great sense of depth, and the gimmicks were solid. Fun facts: This movie used 80,000 gallons of blood, which means it's the bloodiest movie in the world. Richard Dreyfuss stated that he did this movie just for money. The movie was delayed theatrically four times before it made its debut. This film wasn't screened for critics yet holds a current 75% Certified Fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes and a not-so-bad 53 on Metacritic.",Piranha 3D
143,edwardrevans,So bad its good,8,12 September 2010,"Now I'm a big fan of the original, so thought id take a look at this and see if it was a straight remake, Which to my surprise is not. Lets start with the 3D and get that out of the way, the 3D is not required to make this movie work and could have easily passed without it. The Plot, well it kinda has one and it don't but thats what this film is about. its about a B movie remake that is to entertain and be silly which it does in spades. Kelly Brook is Terrible in it yet shes perfect for the role she is cast, playing the Porno Actress and is there to titillate. The Movie itself is self referential and lampoons others of the genre e.g Jaws. I.m Actually looking forward to the sequel which i hope this time will be shot in proper 3D not the retrofit that this seems to be. Was i entertained..Well yes.",Piranha 3D
144,axismladen,Not good enough. Not even for what was expected!,2,2 November 2011,"It's so weird when you have to complain about a movie being unintelligent even when the movie was meant to be unintelligent. Unfortunately, that happens a lot.Piranha 3D is a mess of a movie that is literally based on a whole bunch of good looking bodies being chopped to pieces. I wish i could say more about it, but that's it. To be honest, those good looking bodies are among the only thing's good about the movie. The visuals suck, the music is in no way entertaining or memorable, they could've at least throw in some rock'n'roll to make it a bit more attractive, cinematography is, as it always is these days with this type of film, music video like, and the directing is terrible.When you have a horror film that's not scary, it's like having a comedy that's not funny, or an action movie without any action in it. Horrors these days always try to make your stomach sick and stuff, but quite quickly, in the last ten years, seeing a man eaten to death by a bunch of piranhas became no scarier than watching Anaconda eat Jon Voight. Only Anaconda is a better movie! Not that i mind dumb movies, but you gotta make sure they're entertaining. And a tiny bit of something unpredictable could help. Oh yeah, ------SPOILER-------, i expected a sex scene and it never came! That was really unpredictable! Great storytelling! There are only three things that saved this film from being a total flop. Those are: good looking bodies, actors that can be tolerated and the fact that as dumb as it is, it's smart enough not to take it self seriously.Piranha 3D is the kind of movie that's not boring, but that's not entertaining enough either. And when you make a movie about a bunch of piranhas eating people, the one thing that can and should be very good about it if you want it to work is entertainment!",Piranha 3D

It tells the story of a Victorian lake that is always visited by tourists every summer, in other places, ancient piranhas that escaped from underground rivers threaten residents and tourists who partying on the lake ...

146,The-Last-Prydonian,This is one film that should have have been thrown to the fishes!,2,27 April 2011,"It's been some twenty odd years since I saw the original ""Piranha"" as a kid, a seventies B-Movie which acquired a cult status. Meaning that Hollywood big wigs not content on coming up with original and innovative ideas like to consume and regurgitate old films. Take the trashy ""Friday the 13th"", and ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" reboots for instance. Although not all remakes are bad and some do something new or put a fresh spin on things if not with totally pleasing results. eg. ""The Hills Have Eyes"" and ""Last House on the Left"". ""Piranha"" or ""Piranha-3D"" as it is also known(a cheap gimmick no doubt to entice filmgoers) belongs to the former class. Directed by Alexandre Aja who incidentally directed 2006's ""The Hills Have Eyes"" reboot. It's for my money a dull, vacuous piece of trash with little or anything to recommend it. The problem chiefly is that for the first hour of this drivel Aja seems concerned with filling the screen with tantalising shots of semi-dressed women in bikini's or wearing nothing at all to spare their blushes and less with expanding on the films slight plot. It feels as if Aja's trying to drag the movie out too much and pad over It's paper-thin story which concerns a lake next to a seaside town having been revealed to have another lake underneath it where the pesky Piranha's have existed for years. Now making their way to the higher lake they begin to prey on the hordes of partying locals and holiday makers who as of course, ridiculously braindead idiots do in these movies fail to heed the warning of the local police. Elizabeth Shue, a decent actress is given the thankless task of heading the cast and one wonders why she or anyone else involved had anything do with this pap. But try as she might she can't do anything to save it. Jerry O'Connell, presumably on hand to offer some light comic relief as a sleazy pornographer is lumbered with some horrendous lines which presumably are meant to be funny but prove to be stilted and embarrassingly infantile. Model, Kelly Brook meanwhile merely seems on hand to be the obligatory eye candy that gets her kit off to please the horny, teenage male film going crowd that this movie is partially geared towards. Only when the Piranhas appear in their entirety do things really begin to seem to pick up but even then It's not enough to save the film. At times it's handling is patchy to the extent where it at times it's laughably OTT. The usual experts are wheeled on that just add to the formulaic incompetents which abounds and don't really offer anything but story exposition and potential Piranha chow. Christopher Llyod also on hand as an eccentric marine biologist does nothing but gurn and look bug eyed to the point that It's sickening. Eventually the veteran has the task of being the set up for a very bad and contrived final joke which No doubt is left in to leave it open for a money grabbing sequel. A prospect that is about as unappetising as the whole film. I'd sooner inject myself with heroin than endure this bilge again and while potentially lethal I'm in no doubt it would give me infinitely more pleasure! Add a tacked on romantic sub-plot and all I can say is don't stay away from the water, just stay away from this film!",Piranha 3D
147,moviemaniac008,Expect the Expected,9,30 August 2010,"For those of you who saw the trailer, you can already expect loads of nudity and gore. And if you walk in Piranha 3D (do yourself a favour and watch it in 3D, it's definitely worth it) expecting these things, then you'll have a good time. Maybe it will go down in history as being a cult favourite within 10 or 15 years from now, but it probably won't be nominated at the Golden Globes or the Academy Awards, and that's fine because the crew know that and only want to offer a really great time. Piranha is a film that won't please to everyone: After all, it's sort of meant to laugh of other horror movies that use huge chunks of blood and gore to ''scare'' you, without exactly being a parody.All in all, I was pleased with what I got. Some scenes had me laughing quite hard while in others, I literally jumped out of my seat. The acting was good, with no one really acting great, but everybody, from Elisabeth Shue to Jerry O'Connell, while going through Kelly Brook, Porn Star Riley Steele, Ving Rhames and small-time actors Jessica Szohr and Steven R. McQueen, everybody seemed to be having fun while shooting this movie. The CGI effects weren't as bas as expected and frankly, I didn't notice one scene featuring some cheesy dialogue. Blood and Gore is served in buckets and litres, so you might want to be prepared for that, and there's a lot of nudity as well. Maybe not a safe bet for young children but teens will have probably seen worse movies.Story: An earthquake liberates thousands of bloodthirsty, prehistoric piranhas during the same week Lake Victoria is celebrating the annual spring break, where hundreds of teens come to party every year. Sheriff Julie Forester (Elisabeth Shue) tries to keep some order until she discovers about the piranhas and tries her best to close the lake with her deputies. Meanwhile, her son Jake (Steven R. McQueen) is asked by the Derrick (Jerry O'Connell) and his Girls Gone Wild stars Danni and Crystal (Kelly Brook and Riley Steele) to show them the nicest places in town to start filming their next porno film, even though his mother had clearly told him to stay home to babysit his younger brother and sister.Of course there's much more to it than that but if I were to write too much about the plot I would probably write a full-length spoiler. All in all, expect what you expect from the trailers and definitely sit back with your popcorn and drink and get ready for a hell of a ride. Definitely one of my top 10 films of the year so far.",Piranha 3D
148,trnjamesbond,GIRLS GONE WILD or a real MOVIE?,2,5 September 2010,"Uhhg, Where do I start?,I was really looking forward to this film. I loved the original, it was just as scary to me as JAWS, so I call it Mini JAWS. But this film, my what a wonderful mess they made. Somebody change the diaper of this film. Because something stinks. Well the opening sequence was done extremely well, love the whole Richard Dryfuss thing, he's such a great performer. The earthquake idea worked for me and then the trench of the lake bed opened up and let out the prehistoric piranha. This idea was even better than the original film. But then we move on to the T&A. Which is okay with me but, even for a low budget horror film there was way too much nudity. It just got annoying to watch, if I wanted to see that, I'd go home and watch a porn. Ya we are in the age of the whole girls gone wild thing, But I paid money to see piranha, not 3/4's of the film, this kind of entertainment. I just was so sick of the annoying people in this film, I wanted them just to all die and most of them did, But I must say if I could use a title for this film I would have renamed it BAY OF BLOOD. Sorry Mario Bava fans. But the gore was way over the top, Jerry O'Connell's performance was pathetic and annoying like a fly in your ear. I just hated him in this film his lines were stupid and childish. The rest of the cast were pretty good. The young children were great, they get stuck on that Island and needed help, it kind of reminds me of Jaws II. That aspect was awesome, I also liked Elizabeth Shue's performance she was excellent along with her son and his girlfriend. That was pretty good acting from all three.But I wish they would have expanded the role of Christopher Lloyd, and the whole prehistoric idea behind the fish, and made that the main part of the film. Instead filling the plot with weak childish in your face nudity, stupidity, and gore. Could have been toned down a bit, and filled it with science and understanding. Watching this film made me feel like the writers and directors think that their target audience is just a bunch of morons that don't have any intelligence at all.Well I must say that the only people who don't have intelligence when it came to this movie were the writers, producers(Eli Roth), and that's all.Well in short this movie was a pathetic attempt to remake a cult classic, and all I have to say is they should have made the movie more intelligent, instead they ripped us off by making us watch a gory version of girls gone wild.

It's spring break and 20,000 college kids are shaking their asses with beer and parties galore. There's no character development to speak of but there are some well-structured scenes with high-impact entertainment.Look out for old-school favorites in Elisabeth Shue (Leaving Las Vegas/Adventures in Babysitting) and Back to the Future's Doc - Christopher Lloyd.

151,jcaraway3,Dare I say it? A little too gory...,6,28 July 2011,"Here we have yet another modern horror remake of a superior film of the past. This time it's ""Piranha"" a remake of Joe Dante's classic 1978 horror comedy about,(you guessed it) piranhas. The plot is not really worth mentioning, as it is just a backdrop for scene after scene of carnivorous cgi piranha munching-which, by the way, gets a little bit too graphic for my tastes. This sounds strange, because I love a load of good gore in my horror movies, but this just pushed the blood soaked envelope whenever it got a chance. Seriously, gallons of blood in the water, while maimed humans, dripping with blood, scream in pain, is a little nauseating. Come to think of it, maybe it wasn't the quantity of gore in this film, but rather the way it was depicted, that sickened me. The gore gets a little too disturbing, actually. The ""aftermath"" scene is a good example. I felt sorry for some of the characters who were killed in this film. Especially the girl who is pulled apart by two idiots who are carrying her through an ocean of body parts, a girl who gets scalped after her hair is caught in a boat's propeller, a guy who washes ashore with half of his skin missing, and a para sailing girl who gets her legs bitten off. That's not the way a movie like this is supposed to work. I'm not supposed to feel sorry for those idiot teens! No fair, movie! You play too rough! This movie made me ill, not excited. Feverish instead of entertained. The only thing that makes this less disturbing than Vietnam war footage is knowing it was fake. Jerry O'Connell's death scene is amusing, but in no way makes up for the hundreds of other horrifying deaths in this movie. I gave it a six, because in spite of the fact that it is puke inducing and nasty, that's what it was aiming for, and it pulled it off nicely. Many people seem to enjoy that sort of thing. Maybe I'm just outgrowing it. Oh, andChristopher Lloyd and Richard Dreyfuss (despite the latter having a cameo honoring ""Jaws"") were underused.

156,jonnyhavey,A 3D Remake Just For Fun,4,6 September 2010,"Wait for DVD My Critical Perspective: D+ Personal Perspective: B-A 3D remake of a film series that started in the 1970s that does not take itself seriously at all. Alexandre Aja (a relatively new director who directed Mirrors with Kiefer Sutherland in 2008) directs the film and combines two things to make this critical summer nightmare of a film into a very entertaining experience: 1) Graphic Nudity and 2) Graphic Blood and Gore. The plot in one sentence is: There are thousands of college students in swimsuits partying during their spring break in a small town at Lake Victoria, when thousands of prehistoric piranhas resurface and crash the party and leave their mark.The Good: The film was made for nothing else than pure entertainment. The film does not waste its time with character development or developing a pointless dramatic story. Instead as the viewer you don't even have to think at all. Just sit back get ready to close your eyes at parts and enjoy. (Richard Dreyfus and Christopher Loyd appear in the film as well)The Bad: The truth is the film is horrible. However, I think the worst thing about the film is the 3D itself. The film does not necessarily look bad in 3D, its just that there is actually no point in having the film in 3D. The 3D does not add to its entertainment value and just makes the ticket price too expensive ($14.00!!!). As stated above the only thing that really makes the film any good is how horrible the film actually is. There is no substance, no storyline, horrible acting, etc. The film has everything that makes a bad movie.Final Thought: This film is everything an entertaining bad horror film needs to be. I do recommend seeing it, but avoid paying the hefty 3D price for a film that shouldn't be in 3D. Therefore, I recommend to Wait for DVD and remember that this film does not take itself seriously so you shouldn't either.",Piranha 3D

I cant believe Richard Dreyfuss was the first to go. The acting, well let me say Iv seen better actors. It was all about Ving Rhames for me, with his awesome but cheesy quote The editing started off pore but then it got better through out the movie.The special effects again were good enough for the film. But my i ask, what was the point in the scene where two of the girls make out under water with operatic music in the background? Also there happened to be the scientist who knew exactly what the fish was and its prehistoric history.Overall, this movie is pretty bad but again its grate for a giggle with your friends.

I could cut a good half an hour of teenagers dancing to bad music, saying stuff like ""show me the titties baby!"", girls sucking tequila out of each others belly buttons, and generally getting naked and making out. This film is basically a brochure for horny teenagers looking forward to spring break, with loud (and really bad) rap and r&b music blaring out every other scene with people dancing in bikinis ... hell even when the women die Aja manages to get their bikini tops to fall off! We have a wafer thin plot with a (wasted) Liz Shue as a police woman who after finding a dead Richard Drefuss (why Richard?)in the lake goes off to investigate an earthquake in the lake that has caused it to crack and release these prehistoric Piranhas. So the Piranhas? Rubbish, CGI cartoon garbage. There is plenty of gore but its over the top and sometimes amusing especially Jerry O'Connell and his ultra skinny legs.Alexandre Aja made his name on Haute Tension or Switchblade Romance as its known in some countries, he then cemented his name as a serious horror director to look out for with the terrific remake of The Hills have Eyes, but this film is a serious mis stepHeck this film didn't even have an ending it just stops when they kill a 'couple' of the Piranha - then there is the very end.. it turns out these are just the babies ! Yep I thought that was crap as well. Overall I would say a lot of talent was wasted on thisForgettable",Piranha 3D
159,MadBadMovieman,Great Piranha Sequel but 3-D not worth it,6,24 August 2010,"I enjoyed this new sequell/remake. Good Characters, actors, script overall. Jerry O. was perfect as the Movie Director/Producer! Likable Characters for the Sheriff and her Kids and supporting cast. Would have been nice to see more of Christopher Lloyd too. Maybe in a sequel. And Kelly Brooke-What else can you say but she is Awesome on Film! Wish it was out in 2-D because it was not worth the extra $$ to watch with glasses. This was an Entertaining movie with lots of action, huge body count and some really mean fish. I might see it again if it gets out in 2-D. Don't go see it expecting an award for anything other than special effects. It's not that kind of movie. Just enjoy it for what it is.",Piranha 3D
160,Blackace,Girls Gone Wild Meets SAW.,7,24 August 2010,"Just wow!! I went to see Piranha 3D and was blown away by what I saw. I had seen the original Piranha and I figured a reboot of the film would be a lot better. So yes, the movie is better then the original, but there were a few problems I had with the film.First of all the story is about hundreds of prehistoric piranhas being released from an underwater lake cavern after a small earthquake rocks the lake. These man-eating beasts have been feeding off eat other for hundreds of years, while laying thousands of eggs. When one of the local fisherman goes missing a search is sent out. A local police woman Julia (Elisabeth Shue) and Deputy Fallon (Ving Rhames) finds the boat on the shore and the fisherman's body pops up as well. Of course they want to close the lake, but it's spring break and the party must go on. Big mistake.Now, the problem I have with the film is the first 30-40mins is nothing but T&A with college kids being obnoxious in their boats. It's like ""Girls Gone Wild"". There was very little character development. We know that Julie son is in town to baby sit is little sister and brother, but decides to become a lake location guide for Derrick Jones (Jerry O'Connell) who makes soft porn type videos. The second half of the film is all about the piranhas and their favorite food. Humans. There is more gore, guts, decapitations, body parts and missing flesh off of every body limb in this movie then any I've ever seen. Yes, it's more bloody and gory then the ""SAW"" and ""Hostile"" movies. Really great special effects though. The gore and carnage looked very real. This is not a movie for kids. I was ready for the gore and blood, but this was like a meat market. Was very over the top and a bit overdone.Many of the actors and actresses are wasted in this movie. Only Elisabeth Shue, Steve R. McQueen, Jerry O'Connell and Jessica Szohr has a major role. Ving Rhames don't have much to do but scream at the swimmers and try to kill the piranhas. Dina Meyers wasn't used much at all and neither was Christopher Lloyd. It was more like a cameo for these actors.The film ends abruptly with a chance for a sequel. Actually a sequel has already been announced by the producers. Chances are good it will be at a different location. I was hoping they would continue this film from where it left off, but I'm be surprised if that happens. If you like a lot of gore and want to see full body nudity and lots of T&A, then this is the movie for you. I gave this film a 7 score. It really felt like the story was rushed and the characters never truly were developed well. I didn't care about any of them. The film is only 84mis long. Hopefully the sequel will be better.",Piranha 3D

(The regurgitated severed penis was as close as it got. And that was only funny in an uncomfortable sort of way.)The clichés are all there. And there are enough stolen references from Jaws and Jaws II to write a paper about. But the tension isn't there...even with the putting of very young children in peril.Some of the gross-out stripped-of-flesh bodies effects are good, if that's to your taste. The CGI fish, however, don't cut it.The producers forgot one thing about the Piranha franchise: it's comedy/horror not horror/gross out. They should have hired Roger Corman as a consultant.

Lots of blood and gore and plenty of scenes with bikini girls git bitten and chewed on the bum and other places. I've watched this movie time and time again so I just really have it on in the background when I'm doing other stuff not really following the story, what there is of it.If you are a gore fan you will absolutely adore the scene where all the piranhas crash the beach party.",Piranha 3D

The dialogue is silly, and the story is predictable. But that doesn't mean this movie is not a lot of stupid fun, especially in 3D. Fans of monster movies might be intrigued by Steven R. McQueen's starring role. He's the grandson of Steve McQueen, so perhaps this is his ""Blob."" Don't bother with movie this if you don't want to tolerate grade-C artistry, but if you like movies that proudly display their silliness and don't aspire to be anything more than gory bloodbaths, indulge.

Yeah, so if you've seen one of these type films, you pretty much know how this movie is going to go. Except this film rips off other films in this genre in the most horrible way.The acting is horrible, the special effects are comical, and there is not much believability to much of what happens in this film. For example, how effective are you going to be at killing thousands of man-eating piranhas in a lake with a shot gun? Stupid, huh? It is, yet more than one person tries to do it in this film.Plus there's one particular incident where the film makers tried to create humor but only succeeded in unnecessary and inappropriate stupidity unlike anything I've ever seen before.And the plot twist at the very end is an after thought, if that.

The implied thought there is: ""you must have seen the trailer; what did you think you were going to see?"" What if you didn't see the trailer? How did you end up in the theater watching this? Why are you watching this?These are all questions in my head the entire time. Sure, there are celebrity cameos everywhere, trying to play serious roles in a lake-town setting during Sprng Break as mad fish invade their watery, hedonist hangout. The acting alone cannot make a good enough bandage to cure this diseased creature-horror movie. This is ""Snakes On A Plane."" This is ""Mega Python vs. Gatoroid."" In other words, you're not gaining anything by seeing this film. There's no philosophical wonderment or surprise ending. It's just dudes, beer, swimming, naked boobies, and a lot of destroying boats and bodies. There you go: major spoiler.I enjoyed the quality of certain shots, where the gore actually paid off and you got to see the time put into those shots, but the rest of the ""reality"" of the horrific gore fest in the movie is pushed aside to feature shotgun and tazer play...against fish...with humans in the water.

I wish I had watched it in 3D because I think the effects would have been very good and in your face. I think that a lot of people were disappointed by this because they were expecting it to be scary. Overall I would say that Piranha is a good film for a good ol' gore fest.

170,Aomalle27,I liked it,8,26 February 2012,"Call me crazy, but I actually enjoyed this film. The producers did right in crafting a trailer for the film that presented it in it's true light; campy horror fun. It's definitely a step above the 70's original, and the sci if remake of the 90s. This takes a rather simple concept and thrusts the three essentials of all great horror films, gratuitous nudity, graphic violence, and humor in the light of all the tragedy. Gotta throw some laughs in to lighten the mood and remind people it's just fantasy. Earthquake opens up a fissure between a Nevada Lake (at Spring Break time no less) and a prehistoric underground lake containing pirhanna. They have massive appetites, and the human smorgaborg is just what the doctor ordered. Plus, it has some effects to really take advantage of the 3d technology it pushed to hype the film.",Piranha 3D

Forget the usual dark tone of a horror film. As a matter of fact, please turn the brain switch to ""off"", and enjoy the ride.I am a fan of Alexandre Aja's work, especially Haute Tension and The Hills Have Eyes. When I read about that film project being in pre-production, I was quite puzzled to say the least. I thought the whole idea behind this film was completely silly, and I could hardly imagine how even a director of Aja's talent would be able to bring such a script to the screen and make it the slightest bit worthy.Amazingly enough, he pulled it off. Not that this is his best film, but Piranha manages to capitalize on a solid cast, a handful of over-the-top, gory silliness, and an overall old school trashy horror film feeling to make it an enjoyable spectacle altogether. This film was made for the 3D format, and it becomes obvious pretty quickly if you happen to watch the 2D version. It doesn't transition that well, especially when it comes to the scenes involving the piranhas. That's probably the film's biggest flaw, but oddly enough, it sort of adds up to the overall silliness of the ensemble and tones down its gruesomeness.The plot is thinner than a sheet of paper. It's not that big of a deal, thanks to the characters, an array of stereotypes taken straight out of different movie genres, from the character of Laura to Christopher Lloyd's. You get to witness all these different people deal with this whole silly situation of prehistoric piranhas invading the Arizona waters during the Spring Break and see how it unfolds...it never takes itself seriously, and it manages to deliver crowd-pleasing fun.And while this is a purposely poor story in terms of development, there are some funny references for genre connoisseurs (i.e. : when they find the fisherman's rotten body, and you see a crab walk out of his eye socket, it's a reference to Lucio Fulci's Zombie). The direction is very competent, the cast delivers, and there is enough boobs (aaaahhhh Kelly Brook), gory fun and laughs to make this an overall enjoyable ride that got the crowd reacting several times, be it with laughter, disgust, or complete disbelief.Not a classic, but some very decent entertainment if you like horror films and/or comedies.",Piranha 3D

174,DesertDogMedia,Piranha,7,7 July 2014,"Title: PiranhaCondensed Storyline: It is spring break in America, everyone is having fun. A teen who has to watch his siblings for his mother, leaves them at home and goes out to film porn for a coke sniffing white guy. Around the same time an underwater cave system is opened up, this releases mutant piranha into the water which all of the partying teens are in. So the sheriff finds out her children are on a sinking boat out in the river and has to go off to save them. Notable Acting: Elisabeth Shue felt like an actual independent single mother, and was actually believable as the police officer who doesn't take it lightly. Jake played by Steven McQueen is as realistic for a teenager as you can get. Needless to say I did not like the child actors, but I must admit. They were portrayed correctly for their age. Everyone else had expendable acting, which generally meant that their character wasn't developed at all, so you knew they were going to be dying. Noticeable Camera work: Establishing shots of the fossil dig site. With most creature feature movies there is also a lot of voyeuristic shots portrayed throughout the movie, typical of the water predator type shot. First birds eye shot of the second person to die in the movie. More of a shot type for this one, the point where the first diver pulls out a flare to light the surrounding area and is shown to be surrounded by the piranha. You can see from the shot that he is a dead man. Graphics: CGI for the piranha is good, looks realistic. The movie had enough faith in the CGI of the piranha that they put it right in front of us in our first proper viewing of it. I can say without a doubt that the CGI is greatest I've seen in a B-list creature feature movie. It is so good that it almost looks real.Overall Feel: If you like breasts and bucket loads of gore in your creature feature movie, this movie is for you. Being only a B-list movie it goes on the record of showing that even though it is a B-list, people still put effort into the movie. Unlike other B-list movies which don't even try to be good movies. It is one of the few films to ingrain fear of an animal onto the minds of watchers. The reality of the situation is that normal piranhas are no more dangerous than other medium sized fish, but if you find them during the dry season, that is where you need to be careful as their food levels are at their lowest and the piranhas are generally starving. A fun little note is that the name of the boat is called ""barracuda"", this is ironically comical because a barracuda is a long slender fish with sharp pointy teeth. But now for the science of the piranha, if they were actually kept in the dark they would be albinos. This is seen among species that live in the darkness of caves. They would also be blind due to the darkness and would have heightened senses to counteract the blindness. The fact of surviving for millions of years by only cannibalising each other is impossible, mainly due to needing exterior energy to survive, fight and breed. At 52 minutes in when go into the party scene which contains the most blood, gore and nudity than any other part of the movie. This also brings me to the part where horror movies surprise me with the creative ways they find to kill people. The movie is a balance of standard horror and cheesy horror, this is blended well as you can easily tell what is made to be funny and what isn't. Standard black comedy movie.",Piranha 3D

Not only does he remake Joe Dante's 1978 original in a fresh and exciting way but he also happily ridicules the whole B-movie genre while also skewering contemporary Girls-Gone-Wild/Spring Break trash culture. As if this were not enough, 'Piranha 3D' is a gore-fest par excellence. The plot is completely basic: an earthquake opens a fissure in a lake near the desert resort of Virginia Beach, releasing huge numbers of prehistoric piranha that had been confined to an underground cave for the preceding two million years. In best B-movie tradition, this occurs during Spring Break which allows for colossal amounts of nudity and the opportunity to watch huge numbers of obnoxious frat boys and empty- headed coeds get turned into fish-feed. There are a good number of scary moments and the special effects are fantastic, the 3D effects actually pop also. Given that Aja is at the helm, the gore flows in absolute buckets and some scenes later in the film are extremely intense. The amount of nudity, sexuality, and graphic violence in this film more than justify it's 'R' rating and this is one of those horror films that is genuinely unsuitable for young children. The cast (including Elizabeth Shue as the sheriff and Richard Dreyfus in a cameo) actually do their best with a pretty sophomoric script, and there are some truly tasteless moments of gross-out humor.

It's definitely a sickening movie, I feel like I don't wanna be there but I wanna be there because of the hot chicks, it's amateurish. Well we won't be seeing a typical family in there, it's a summer beach party of the college type crowd, and that's the setting of the movie, so don't expect a lovely kid being eaten by piranhas, we don't wanna see that. We wanna see careless people who only care about their pleasures, being slaughtered. This movie didn't went that far accepting the fact we did not see a nice happy family being digested, instead it became a joke as we saw a penis being puked by a piranha after fighting for it. It's almost funny to see a bunch of party animals screaming in terror after partying so loud. Yes, it scared the hell out of us to go in the water, obviously by using make-ups and special effects to make it realistic and gruesome. But unlike ""Jaws"" which made us think twice before swimming into the sea, using the crafty techniques by Spielberg inspired by Hitchcock, and the unforgettable score. The main characters aren't the hero types, but they are less annoying than Eli Roth. In terrifying us, it succeeded, but it doesn't have a good climax, it was not properly executed. Even the last heroic and dramatic scene wasn't believable, it's easy to say that they survived because they were the main characters. It lacks situations, difficult and inventive situations. It's a quick terrifying movie, it didn't hang around for a little bit more to give us a lasting scare. Although it's too much, it wasn't enough, you know what I mean? Am I excited for the sequel?

Plenty of everything a horror movie should have - blood, gore, nudity, partying, even decent acting and a believable plot.The special effects are obviously CGI this and CGI that, and they are mediocre at best. But that's not enough to take away from the enjoyment I had watching this. Aside from that, everything else in this movie works. Thousands of prehistoric piranhas have escaped from an underground lake due to seismic activity. It's spring break, and there are girls in bikinis galore. Also, a porn film crew that enlists 17-year-old Jake as their personal tour guide and his friend-who's-a-girl-but-not- his-girlfriend to tag along on their boat and shoot a film. Meanwhile, Jake's mother, also the sheriff, is dealing with a dead fisherman's body that has been ripped to shreds, and is advised not to close the lake due to the high financial benefit of the spring-breakers who are using the lake for, well, a place to party. This movie has lots of laughs, including a really gross gag about a severed penis. Sick, yes. Hilarious, hell yes. This movie is not trying to be taken seriously, and that's what makes it work.There is an extreme amount of gore, specifically one particular scene when the piranhas attack all the spring breakers, which is extremely graphic and will make some people sick, not only because of the attacking creatures, but the people taking desperate measures to get away (for example, taking a boat and trying to start the motor with a girl's hair caught in the prop, we see her screaming, then her entire scalp gets ripped off as the motor starts.)Very fun and enjoyable, I will be watching this again and again. 9/10",Piranha 3D
180,alexart-1,Just when you thought it was safe to go into the water...again,8,7 September 2010,"In 1978, Joe Dante made Piranha, which is known for being campy fun. Dante went on to make Gremlins, The Howling, and Small Soldiers. In 1981, James Cameron made Piranha Part Two: The Spawning, which is considered by some to be one of the worst movies ever made. Cameron went on to make Avatar and Titanic, the two highest grossing films ever. Now, in 2010, Alexandre Aja made Piranha 3D. What will Aja make in the future? Hopefully, some really good movies because Piranha 3D is the most fun I've had in theaters ever. From bouncing boobs to heads being ripped off, Piranha 3D is simply terrible and at the same time, all too good. This is the kind of movie that is just so bad it is good and there is no other way to say it. The 3D gags are quite fun and there are a few surprising jump scenes along the way.If the plot of Piranha 3D sounds outrageous, it is because it is far fetched and ridiculous in the best way possible. In a small town centered around the beautiful Lake Victoria, a small earthquake opens up an underwater crevasse. Inside this crevasse are little piranhas. Yes, you read it right. The piranhas are prehistoric and hungry for blood. One problem: it is Spring Break and hundreds of college students are partying in the lake. If you laughed at this description, this movie is probably for you.The best part of Piranha 3D is anything that is way over the top, which is most of the film. There is a two minute ""underwater ballet"" sequence in which two beautiful, completely nude women fondle each other in the lake. And we see everything. It is honestly the dumbest scene, but it is purposefully stupid. The last 45 minutes have to be the most gory scenes ever shot on film. Gallons upon gallons of blood are spilled in these scenes. None of the ultraviolent parts will be spoiled, but even though these parts do disgust, they also incite laughter. Many people do not get this and walk out of the theater around half way through, but stick around. You will not regret it.Piranha 3D also marks the second time that 3D has not been used as another ""dimension"" since REAL-D technology was invented. Over the course of the brief film, vomit, a hook, an anchor, piranhas, a bitten off penis, and more are thrown at the audience. Yes, that's right, even a bitten off penis. The special effects and 3D are terrible, but in a good way. As weird as that sounds, this movie works for the sole reason that is bad-good, like Grindhouse or Machete, only worse.Piranha 3D is like a great roller coaster: mostly fun with a few jolts along the way. Full of boobs and blood galore, Piranha 3D creates a lot of laughs as the summer comes to a close. Alexandre Aja done such a horrible/terrific job with this film that I cannot help but think he has got other good tricks that he has yet to show us. Although it was a flop, Piranha 3D may just be the most fun movie this year. At least there is a sequel (supposedly) coming.",Piranha 3D

The movie does not drag at all and it does not take itself seriously at all, so bear that in mind going into it.Bodies get ripped to shreds, blood by the buckets, you are cheering the piranha on throughout. The only disappointment is the CGI but if you told me it was on purpose I would totally believe you.Watch with an open mind and you'll have one hell of a ride.",Piranha 3D
182,DevastationBob-3,"Bloody boobs, and nothing else.",1,21 January 2011,"This movie would have been a bigger hit if they hadn't wasted money on name actors to appear in it. If they'd just stuck to people willing to get topless it could have easily added a million or so to the gross. They paid Richard Dreyfuss like 50,000 dollars for a really pointless cameo, I don't even remember him having lines. Did Ving Rames character even have a name? Sure IMDb lists it, but I watched the movie first and all I could think was, ""Are we supposed to care he's dying?"". I only knew Dina Meyer was in it because her name was in the credits. She spends her entire role in a scuba mask. Elizabeth Shue pretty much plays the same character Kari Wuhrer does in 8 Legged Freaks, Sheriff Mom. OK, Ving, Dina and Shue aren't exactly Johnny Depp when it comes to in depth character portrayal, but come on! They're actors, let them practice their craft. Most of this movie is people screaming and running out of the water with limbs missing. Or boobs. Come to think of it, I feel i've wasted my time even writing a review for this. If you like story and character, I give this a 1 star (and only because IMDb doesn't go any lower, unlike Aja) but if all you want is blood and boobs, it's probably a 10.Thank god for Redbox that I only wasted a dollar on this.",Piranha 3D
183,hdavis-29,Jaws with T&A,8,30 May 2021,"I'm giving this film a high rating, not because this is the sort of entertainment that I recommend or seek out, but because it accomplishes exactly what it intends to. And it does it quite well. The title of my review really covers the essentials. It combines human vulnerability in the water, fear of a dreaded underwater creature, with a healthy dose of bare breasted young women. It's an unbeatable combination for the demographic that will find its way to this film. Oh, and did we mention that the whole thing is in 3-D? Just think of the possibilities. And think about the fact that just about every one of those possibilities, including at least one you wouldn't even have imagined, come true.Despite the T and A, films like this are often deeply prudish. There is a parade of sexually liberated teens showing off their ample, bouncing breasts. You just know that it's not just anyone who will get consumed here. The film makes it clear that these young people are sinful and, inevitably, they must be punished. In this case the punishment predictably entails being eaten alive by prehistoric fish. Not surprisingly, none of these effects are subtle or off-camera. We get a full measure of blood and gore.Here's the thing, though. It's extremely well done. You don't have to suspend much disbelief as these horrible, primitive-looking fish things, with jaws agape lunge three-dimensionally into our faces. And we don't have to wonder what's being done to all these nubile bodies. The pieces float right by us, including one rather shocking scene involving a male body part. There's also a graphic dismemberment scene borrowed directly from the 1970 film Catch 22. It was shocking then, and it's still shocking here, more than half a century later.Interestingly, the film has its limits. It's clear there are certain things an audience would not tolerate, at least the mainstream audience intended for this film. The producers knew what they were doing and stay well within those boundaries. Unlike the real world, these predators draw the line at attacking children. The two kids in the story remain untouched, despite ample opportunity for carnage. The other bit of prudery, if that's what it is, concerns which body parts are fair game for the piranha. In the real world, flesh is flesh to a carnivorous fish. It's all dinner. That rule applies to the male characters in the film: no body part is spared. But the women operate in a safer universe. Despite continuously displaying their breasts with full benefit of 3-D, no such violations appear in the film. It's not that these are PG-rated fish. They do more than their share of munching and tearing of human flesh. It's just that they're rather circumspect about female anatomy. Better a leg than a breast.One norm that this film does violate to our benefit is to include some credible acting (Elisabeth Shue performs her role quite well), some decent dialogue and characterization, as well as some excellent cinematography. The only acting that is comically over the top is by Christopher Lloyd as the ""scientist"" trying to explain why these extinct fish are suddenly terrorizing the local revelers. But Lloyd plays his role exactly as it is written. It's the same lovably exaggerated character he played in the Back to the Future franchise. It's simply who he is and what we expect of him.The punchline is that this movie is better than you'd expect it to be. If the genre is offensive to you, stay away from it. This film isn't pretending to be Citizen Kane. It wears its Gore on its sleeve. But what it does, it does very well. It may be a bit harder for some viewers to defend themselves against what happens on screen simply because the film is so well made. It's easier to distance oneself when the characters are silly, the dialogue is wooden, and the cinematography and F/X are inept. None of that is true here.",Piranha 3D

The movie is obviously a big joke, and it makes fun of itself...AND IT S STILL DAMN ENTERTAINING TO WATCH! I'm really liking the director AJA, he is becoming one hell of a great director! My theater cracked up all the way through it (but in a good way), and believe it or not...my audience clapped and I have to admit, i slightly clapped as well! 85 minutes of great, bizarre (porny) fun! 8/10!",Piranha 3D
185,woinaroschy_1979,You'll either love it or hate it!,8,16 September 2010,"This is a movie you'll either love or hate. You'll love it if: a. you're a guy b. you're a fan of the horror/gore movies from the 70's and 80's c. if you like one or more of the following things: soft porn, beautiful girls with boob jobs, butts, the MTV channel.The entertaining effect is maximum if you are a bunch of guys on a night out! You'll hate it if: a. you're a woman b. you're no fan of horror or gore movies c. soft porn and the MTV channel disgust you. Basically the movie is like an MTV summer party show with a lot of blood and gore thrown in. It's spring break and everyone knows what this means: crazed teens with hormones gone wild party half naked or totally naked on the shores of Lake Victoria when some prehistoric piranhas are set free by accident (earth quake in this case). What follows is pretty clear, only it's an even more gigantic massacre than anyone expects. You've got a 20 minute or so scene with piranhas eating away those teenagers, blood running in rivers (literally, apparently 23 m3 of synthetic blood or paint have been used for this movie!!), body parts flying everywhere, blonde brainless girls getting their hair tangled in various machines with gruesome results (eeew) and a floating scene that sinks à la Titanic bringing down with it everyone on board. True gore, but the shade of wit and humor never fades throughout the entire movie. From the wet T-shirt contest referee that dies saying ""wet T-shirts..."" to the guy that gets his penis chewed off by piranhas (""they ate my dick"") and the girl that fights those terrifying monsters with a (!!) frying pan (ROFL), not to forget the two porno stars that perform some under water swimming with no strip of cloth on their backs (or any other part of their body that is) with a famous classical music piece performed in the background, Aja manages to make a refreshing, relaxing, funny, entertaining, hilarious movie. The end is not unexpected (I mean we all know one fish will get away and return in the sequel), but I was surprised by the idea and found it very original (won't give it away, it's really good!!!) And to those saying that this movie is an offense to women, all I can say is that it actually shows how wrong and stupid it is to see women just as some bimbos with big breasts. The guy filming them gets his penis chewed off by piranhas, I think that's a pretty severe punishment for his ""crime"" of being a porno movie producer. To finish let me just surprise you by saying that I am a woman and I thought the movie cool, but I have the impression that I belong to a very small minority. Definitely funny and enjoyable, and not to be taken seriously! After all it's all about ""Sea..sex...and blood"".",Piranha 3D
186,sorendanni,MeToo,4,22 December 2020,"I remember in 2010, I really had fun with Piranha 3D.Now that I've watched the movie again 10 years later, I notice that it gets worse with age.The script is the main problem: There is not much of it. There is no plot, no mystery, no suspense and no climax. In fact, Piranha 3D can be summed up as: teenagers in swimwear (or without...) eaten by prehistoric fish.Film-technically, I also find the special effects really below average. This is a big problem because it makes this Horror movie never get scary, it's all so fake. Only on syfy do I regularly see even worse special effects.I suspect that a lot of money has gone to porn stars for the excess of unnecessary nude scenes. It doesn't do anything for the story, it does however make the film misogynistic: is a woman in a movie only good to swim naked?Too bad about this stereotype, because the only good acting performance was that of a woman: Elisabeth Shue as a female Sheriff. Solid, despite the poor character development. Every other actor did unfortunately a very poor job. It makes me wonder where the director got his pool of non-talent? Dirty Larry 4?In short, a Hyped B-Horror in 2010 that I gave 7/10 at the time. Today I am no longer a teenager, today we have MeToo and I think 4/10 is actually too generous...",Piranha 3D
187,butterman_1999,Not for everyone (target audience is obvious),5,9 May 2019,"POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD!Although I could go into much detail about how this film works on some levels but fails at others, perhaps it is best to simply boil it down to the ""Piranha 3D"" remake as film not for everyone, and it's target audience is quite obvious from within the first few minutes (post-first scene of course).I will say that I did not like this film much since I have already seen more than my fair share (and against my own volition) of horror-esque films featuring post-teens on spring-break with lots of co-eds in bikinis and slow-motion bouncing ta-tas. In my opinion, enough is enough, and at this point such cash-grabbing gimicks seem out-dated and un-needed, save of course for the aforementionned target audience.The sheer shame of this is that maybe there was a decently good film somewhere in there, at some point (maybe the Weinsteins edited this film in this shape and form in their secret editing room, somewhere) . Actors and actresses such as Dinah Meyer for example, are indeed criminally underused and seem to have been cast strictly to have ""name"" actors attached to the film. Elisabeth Shue, being quite a talented actress (and looking incredibly beautiful in this film) surely is capable of better productions than this, and I do hope she was well compensated for her time on this production.Normally I try not to bother reviewing ""bad"" films which have very little redeaming value but in this case, there was both potential and some moments/elements which were appreciated, but in the end the film does come off as just another generic teens in peril during Spring Break horror schlock-fest.Note-worthy are some of the gore effects which, aside from quite a number of obvious CGI effects and enhancements, do offer quite shocking moments which probably could only have come from the imagination of director Alexandre Aja.In any case, if you don't mind a ton of bare-breasted and bikini-clad co-eds prancing around and drinking booze/snorting coke, all shown for nothing else but gratuity, alongside stereotypical characters and some gore, you may find yourself enjoying this remake.Special props go out to hiring Gianna Michaels for a small cameo, of course!",Piranha 3D
188,siobhanmckibbin,The 21st Century Jaws? I think so not!!!,2,6 September 2011,"I thought this film was going to be appalling, but I was wrong. It was ATROUCIOUS.So the simple plot which makes up this narrative is that an earthquake unleashes a large number of prehistoric piranha fish into Lake Victoria, where coincidently Spring Break is happening. Sheriff Julie Forester amongst others try to stop them before they kill all the half naked, liqueured up teenagers. Quite honestly, i wish they had of all been killed.The only thing that this film offers is soft porn, and the only entertaining element is when Danni, played by Kelly Brook gets completely mauled by the piranha fish.The only salvation in Piranha is the fact that Christopher Lloyd has a cameo role as Mr Goodman, hence me giving the movie 2 stars. Although i do question why he would lower his standards to appear in such a movie.To describe Piranha as a horror is insulting to all the true classic horror films which have been made through time. And although the original 1978 version is not much to get enthusiastic about, it is a damn sight better than the 2010 version. I only wish that people would take the horror genre seriously, instead of turning it into a complete farce.",Piranha 3D
189,CSHaviland,Helpful Tip: Do Not Take Your Mom to See Piranha 3D,6,20 August 2010,"Okay I guess that's probably a no-brainer, but this is a movie for no-brainers. In fact it's God's gift to no-brainers. Piranha 3D is what happens when you give filmmakers obsessed with ""B"" Movies too much money. Although I realize that it may be an oxymoron to say there is such a thing as a ""B"" Movie with a big budget. A ""B"" Movie was originally supposed to mean ""Budget movie,"" (as in: ""very low"" budget), but it's come to be better known to mean ""Bad movie."" But that's not always a bad thing for those movies, which is why they keep coming. The best of those flicks wear ""B Movie"" like it's a badge of honor, and some of them have become cult favorites.Don't get me wrong here... This is not a big budget movie. But it's not a low-low budget movie either. The movie had lots of water stunt work, lots of computer effects, lots of makeup effects, lots of extras, and several expensive actors. Its budget was probably in the low end of medium, wherever that is these days.I don't think there's been a wide-release movie at the theater with this much nudity and violence in more than 20 years. Maybe 30. Maybe ever. Actually, 30 years ago a movie like this would have received an X rating. To which you may respond: ""Okay, and that's a bad thing?""Well no... I mean, far be it from me to dislike hundreds of sizzling hot babes showing lots of flesh in a movie with thousands of hungry prehistoric marine beasties who want their flesh as much as I do (just not in the same way). I'm just saying, this is an unprecedented film in the context of it being a wide release with better-than-Troma effects and more intended laughs than unintended ones. Some of the goriest scenes had me guffaw suddenly enough to jar the 3D glasses off my face.Roger Corman, eat your heart out.Now let's be fair: the filmmakers aren't after the Oscar. They're not trying to make a masterpiece like Jaws, despite the obvious Jaws-nod by casting Richard Dreyfuss to sit out in a boat on the water singing Show Me the Way to Go Home. (I don't know how they managed to talk Dreyfuss into that, but Shaw and Scheider are both deceased, so it was him or nobody.)No, they're chasing the coveted Cult Following milestone. And I think they may have achieved it. This will probably be a college Frat-Favorite for many years to come. It was an emotionally confusing movie to be sure. One minute you're watching a bikini babe licking Tequila and salt off another bikini babe's bare abs and then they kiss, and the next minute one of them is barfing directly toward the camera.In 3D.Lots and lots of topless girls in this movie. And a few bottomless girls too. Bottomless in more ways than one, depending on which scene it is. Some of these chicks bare it all. First for you, then for the fishies. And the gore? Well. There were at least as many detached body parts as intact bodies, and some of those parts I would have rather not seen. Much less seen being eaten by marine life. Much less seen being regurgitated by marine life. (Oh yeah, we get that too.)But was the movie scary? I mean it was a horror movie, and horror movies are supposed to be scary, right? I guess that depends on what scares you. I can't say it scared me at all, but maybe I've seen too many horror movies. Part of the problem with marine-based monster movies is that if you take the people out of the water, all is well. That's why Spielberg wanted to shoot most of the second act of Jaws out in the open water, so that you couldn't see land in any direction until near the end. They're on a dubious looking fishing boat with a shark that's nearly the same size and a crazy shark hunter who smashed up the radio. Spielberg knows how to create tension. The schmucks who made Jaws 2 didn't understand that. And let's not talk about Jaws 3-D or Jaws the Revenge, which were both so poorly written that people were walking out of the audience and asking for their money back.To Piranha 3D's credit, I don't think nobody is going to walk out on it. Most people are there because they liked the trailers, and if they liked the trailers they're not going to be disappointed. But the Piranha 3D writers had to figure out how to get people into the water so the fishies could have lunch. And they had to do it with the police around who were trying to get them out of the water. Answer: outnumber the police five hundred to one with drunk college kids surrounded by lots of boobs. This is the kind of boat party that isn't a real party until the police start shooting guns into the air and ordering them around, and that's their signal to do the opposite. Crank of the volume and jump in. And that's when the fun really begins. Throw in monster fish and a lot of propeller-fu and you've got a blood bath, quite literally.I'm forced to rank this movie very low with respect to hard-core horror movies, which are what I appreciate the most. Like The Exorcist, Jaws, Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978), Alien, Aliens, John Carpenter's The Thing, and The Grudge. Those were masterpieces engineered to create fear and dread and I'm proud to own them and re-watch them every few years. Piranha 3D was a tongue-in-cheek horror, and wisely wasn't marketed to be anything better than that. But as those types of movies go, it ranks pretty high.",Piranha 3D
190,peterlane5,A great remake and a great way to end the summer!!!!,7,21 August 2010,"Alexandre Aja(High Tension, The Hills Have Eyes remake, Mirrors) knows how to make a good horror movie and a great remake(this and The Hills Have Eyes) He could be the next Wes Craven. Aja never shies away from gore and gross death scenes and this movie shows it. The people who worked on this knew it was going to be stupid no matter what and use it to their advantage.I don't like the guys who wrote the screenplay(Josh Stolberg and Peter Goldfinger) also wrote Sorority Row which I thought was downright awful. But then again I wont condemn them for one awful movie. Stolberg also wrote Good Luck Chuck, which I thought was OK besides the fact that Dane Cook was in it(who I dislike). Anyway back to the movie, I was reading that Richard Dreyfuss plays ""Matt Hooper"" and anybody who's seen Jaws knows that he played the character with the same name. It could be speculated that this movie takes place in the same universe. Hooper could have that the ocean wasn't his true calling and moved to Arizona. Christopher Lloyd plays a character similar to his character ""Doctor Emmett Brown"" in the Back to The Future"" movies. Jerry O'Connell plays a character similar to Joe Francis and for anybody who doesn't know who he is, he created Girls Gone Wild. Not to spoil anything but O'Connell's character dies in a way that will make every guy in the audience cringe. But it isn't really graphic and because his character is a total jerk, it kinda makes it funny. I heard that the effects were pretty bad, but I thought they were good. I mean it's nothing like Avatar, but still. I found the gore effects and make-up to be pretty well done. and yes most if not all the scenes involving the piranhas attacking people are very graphic. If you can't handle gore, THIS IS NOT A MOVIE FOR YOU! The only real problems I had were that the dialogue was just plain awful at times such as the same line being used over and over again and that the very last scene is in the previews, so you see it coming from a mile away.

American Pie Gets Eaten you might say.The nudity is nice, and the gore is insane, it's so gory it works as a tense horror movie despite being so over-the-top. I think ""please, stop mutilating these poor party people, you evil fish!""But does it actually work as an entertaining film? Do we care about the characters? I'd say so, the main plucky young guy who's trying to get with the main girl is sympathetic enough. And our action heroes all do well, Elisabeth Shue as the sheriff, Ving Rhames as the badass, and Adam Scott as an unlikely hero. Jerry O'Connell of Sliders fame is hilarious as the requisite asshole character too. And naturally Christopher Lloyd steals the show, hyping up how monstrous the piranhas are with awesome over-the-top dialogue.And of course, England's own Kelly Brook is glorious in this. Legendarily hot and naked, plus she's a nice character who's somewhat heroic even, which is fun.All in all, if you want a fun exploitation horror movie with lots of nude women, and you don't mind tons of fairly disturbing gore, this is a summer movie to check out.",Piranha 3D
192,rynlarson,Disappointing to say the least! (Spoilers),5,21 August 2010,"First...let me preface this by saying that the original Piranha and even the lower than low budget sequel Piranha 2: The Spawning were always fascinating films to me growing up. I also want to add that High Tension and The Hills Have Eyes remake were good films and Aja in my opinion had started to define himself as a contemporary Wes Craven. Mirrors was a step down but I looked forward to Piranha from the moment I heard it was being made. I didn't expect Citizen Kane. Gratuitous violence, nudity, obvious set ups I did expect. I expected and hour and a half of mindless entertainment. Piranha 3D offers you all of those things. What I expected to make the movie special was Aja's ability to create tension and set up sequences to involve the viewer. In this aspect the movie failed. Its starts off wasting a perfect opportunity to be clever with Richard Dreyfuss (in my opinion was wasted....yeah I got it I'm tired and I wanna go to bed) and it goes wasted. His demise and lack of dialogue are a perfect send off for how the rest of the movie is. It fails to shock or involve you. The next 45 minutes are cuts between Elisabeth Shue as the Sheriff investigating Dreyfuss disappearance and a big budget Girls Gone Laka Havasu. While the scenery is appealing it gets old and your waiting for the movie to get going. I was OK with this as long as the payoff was worth the wait. It wasn't. Jerry O' Connell was annoying, Adam Scott shooting individual Piranhas with a 12 guage was just foolish, Ving Rhames using the propeller to slice and dice the fish was stupid knowing he was killing himself. There are thousands and thousands of Piranhas yet somehow the two young heroines are able to kill them all by exploding a small boat, the mega Piranha was I saw that coming times two. All in all if you want to see a 3D private part eaten by a Piranha then spend the money. Other than that skip this one. Boring.",Piranha 3D

The trailers and making of featuretes promise a scary, crazy, tongue in cheek horror film. It delivers on one and three, but I did not find it crazy enough. Most of it seemed at the same level of some more serious creature features. I figure this is not just the film's fault, but all those trailers. They should have been marketed slightly differently, as a more serious (but still tongue in cheek) monster movie throwback. Other than that problem, I liked the film a lot. It was cool to see Adam Scott (One of my faves from Parks and Rec.) in a horror role, which he puled off well. The rest of the cast (A few Oscar-actors some celebrity cameos) were very good too. Unlike in many horror films, the cast didn't have weak points. Everybody did good. Effects wise, I do prefer the Piranhas 3DD's, just because they used more practical instead of CGI, but they did very well here too. The plot actually works well, but the ending feels a little rushed. But what are you going to do??

Watching this film tops (or I should say, ""bottoms"") even that. What's worse is the presence of people who occasionally appear in good films (including one Oscar winner and a onetime nominee) legitimizing it. It is sexist (with the typical female nudity used for titillation and male nudity used for comic relief or as a turn-Off rather than On), gruesome, and crass--a little of which can be used to great effect, as in The Hangover, but here it's extremely poorly executed.This is not an all-in-good-fun horror movie, it's the kind of film that just fuels the fire of people who want to trample the first amendment by showing the awful results achieved by creativity totally devoid of actual meaning. As for the humor, maybe a Morning Zoo-type radio personality would find it funny, but we thought it lame.

It's fair to say that this is a no holds barred exploitation movie – the kind that were a staple of the 70s and 80s – and this is a badge it very wears proudly And loudly In fact from the outset it shouts its intentions from the highest hilltop with the loudest megaphone it can find. Make no mistake: the term 'guilty pleasure' could have been coined for this particular film A man (Richard Dreyfuss in a neat Jaws homage/cameo) is out fishing on a lake when there's a sudden undersea earthquake. Said earthquake unleashes an entire population of prehistoric piranha fish, previously thought to be extinct. They are extremely hungry, but luckily for them it's spring break so the waters are teeming with lots and lots of gym toned male and female bodies. In addition to this, sleazy Jerry O' Connell's character is out to make a nudey Internet flick starring Kelly Brook (now she's come a long way since her squeaky clean image on UK show 'The Big Breakfast'), unaware of the havoc that's about to be unleashed all around them. It's up to the Sheriff (played by Elizabeth Shue in a refreshing gender change from the norm) to save everyone's hides (literally) and also her own children – who, thanks to a neat plot point, are stranded on rapidly sinking/beached yacht after a babysitting stint goes afoul. And so the fun starts with plenty of gore galore.Director Alexandre Aja handles the action and the scares extremely well. After all, it's very hard to get the tone of a movie right where the reaction might be one of mirth one minute and complete terror the next, but Aja succeeds without ever letting the viewer become confused. And there's good tension to be had here. Every time we see a (usually naked) female in the water, we're expecting the inevitable bloodbath, but Aja holds back and holds back The fact is, in his expert hands, we're never entirely sure when or if it's going to happen to a particular character. There's also one particular sequence involving a floating stage toppling over into the ocean, after a deluge of people swamp it while desperately trying to get out of the piranha infested waters that's handled particularly well.Playing the sheriff, Elizabeth Shue is solid and does a good turn on very limited material. It's an understatement to say she looks good in the Sheriff's uniform. Christopher Lloyd also makes a brief appearance in one of his token eccentric roles and adds bit of believability to the proceedings. Jerry O' Connell probably does the best work since he's given a fun and entertaining role he can really get his teeth into.While this is a remake of the original Piranha movie from the late 70s, director Aja has decided to go for a different scenario. Whereas the Joe Dante directed original was made in the shadows of the Vietnam War and concerned shady military experiments, the remake opts for a natural event causing the disaster. This is actually a good idea: in this era of 'climate change' and geological instability, it makes for a more environmentally relevant film. But you can forget about social and environmental commentary because in truth, this movie is essentially about two things: naked babes and killer fish. And boy, do you get plenty of the former In one unashamedly ogling sequence, Kelly Brook and another actress swim, kiss and caress each other underwater (in the nude) in a pointlessly and laughably extended scene that will have viewers giggling at its crassness. In another scene, a woman paragliding behind a speedboat (topless of course) gets her legs bitten off. There's another scene where aw well, you get the picture. This movie won't win any fans among the feminist movement, that's for sure.It's also a tremendously gory movie, especially in the final half hour. In the spirit of the exploitation movies of the past, most of the gory demises are once again aimed at females: a woman get scalped by an outboard motor; another woman is devoured after being bitten in the rear while floating on a hollow rubber inflatable; yet another female's insides fall out after she splits in half while being carried to the shore by two good Samaritans. That's not implying the men get off lightly. In one scene, a character gets his manhood bitten off. Then in an unapologetically tongue-in-cheek move, the aforementioned manhood is spat out at the camera by a piranha suffering from an apparent case of indigestion. Such is the mad tone of this movie: it's crazy from start to finish. One does hope the aforementioned character has a good acting career: if he doesn't, he's liable to be referred as 'wasn't he the guy who got his penis bitten off in Piranha 3D?' Unlike the original 1978 movie and the James Cameron partially directed sequel, all the fish effects here are done with little or no practical effects. For the most part the so-so CGI serves the creatures well, adding an otherworldly quality to their ugly prehistoric appearance. Director Aja also wisely augments these with some nice 'Point of view' shots AKA Jaws (who can forget the piranha POV speeding towards a floating female's behind?).It's fair to say that guys might enjoy this more than the ladies. But it's still a fun and insane film. Yes it's very over the top – but in a good way. While the movie is incredibly violent and bloody, it remains riveting viewing. If you can get past the distracting female nudity, it's actually a crazy ride from start to finish and provides and entertaining night in. All aboard for the sequel!",Piranha 3D
199,MrGoodMovie,Save the Piranhas,5,11 November 2011,"If you prefer your bodies sliced, diced and pureed then this is the film for you.Alexandre Aja (the director) should be congratulated for coming up with so many different ways for his unfortunate stuntmen (and women), and bloodied extras, to either die or be extensively injured.And it is quite hard (if you'll forgive the pun) for me to decide whether it was the dismembered-penis eating piranha, or the vacuous- blond's-brain gorging piranha, that stole the show.To think there was a time when we were shocked by that single scene in the ""Omen"" showing a sheet of glass slicing off a chap's head in slow-mo.Not a lot can be said about the plot, the acting or the dialogue – a lake, lots of speedboats and teenagers, a wet-teeshirt competition (and an even wetter soft-porn director), and an errant baby sitter's charges trapped on a sinking boat - standard B-movie fare. However I thought the ending was a classic – and for a couple of different reasons.Firstly it really was very funny, and perfectly delivered by that most manic of comic straight men – Christopher Lloyd. Secondly it intimated that the wonderfully dentured prehistoric piranhas had survived the incursion of the dopey humans - and after millions of years of existence, had not been driven to extinction in a single day of mayhem.So I say forget the whales and the dolphins - Save the Razor-Toothed Piranhas!",Piranha 3D
200,sarahmillyhannah,Swimming With Fish,6,31 August 2010,"I am a 30 something female. I took my partner to see this, well i wanted to see it and dragged him along and we saw it in 3d. Whats it about? Its about kids getting eaten by Pirahna fish. Thats it. Thats the plot. So if you go and see this expecting Miss Marple you will be disappointed. Is it good? Not really. Is it entertaining? Oh yes. Is it gruesome? Of course and thrown in for good measure is lots of nudity, full nudity from our very own 'i want to be taken seriously as an actress' - Kelly Brook. How anyone could take this film seriously i would never know as its done very tongue in cheek and is meant to be that way. Is the acting good? Yeah for the type of genre of this film i would say the acting was really good. Jerry Oconnell was fab, just fab, I loved Christopher Lloyd, his over acting makes him who is and the Richard Dreyfuss touch was good also. The only one to let us down with the acting I would say is our very own Kelly Brook again. But she is there for eye candy isn't she? Anyone going to watch a film about teens and Pirahna fish not expecting girls to be sunbathing topless or expecting graphically gruesome deaths must not have a clue about this type of film at all. It basically does what it says on the tin but with decent actors - for a change. I would recommend this film for 18 - 30 somethings, especially the boys, although don't get too excited unfortunately most of the girls have surgically enhanced assets that look even more fake than the CGI fish! Sorry.",Piranha 3D
201,OliverGbyrne,Aja gives us something to smile about!,10,20 August 2010,"I like French director Alexandre Aja ,the guy clearly loves the horror genre. His ""High Tension"" was a tribute to 70's horror flick and in many ways his latest films is a tribute of 80's horror film or as Aja himself calls it ""Guilty Pleasure"" films and in many ways I prefer this film because this is the type of film I just adored watching growing up. The film is gory as hell and I mean hardcore gory , limbs floating in the water , Girl cut in half , Fish fighting over a penis...Yeh they have that too. In fact it is without a doubt the goriest film since Peter Jackson's ""Brain dead"" (or ""Dead Alive"" for the US). If you love your film gory , don't waste any more time on here and go watch this film now. Of course this is not all this film has to offer , it has a great cast...a bit of a who's who of 80's stars.An Hilarious Jerry O'Connel (Stand by me) a beautiful Elisabeth Shue (The Karate Kid) and Christopher ""Frickin"" Loyd , seeing that guy on the big screen again his worth the price of admission alone (Even if it's a small part) sure he sound like his ""Back to the future"" persona in this film...but come on?...would we want it any other way? And let's not forget Richard Dreyfuss reprising his ""Jaws"" role for the opening of the film .. That on the other hand I was slightly disappointed with, they could have made the cameo a little bit more clever (see Zombieland to see what a perfect cameo is like). Ho and the 3d ? it's hilariously Awesome , I caught myself making ""push away"" movement at the sight of a floating penis , it's one of the best use of live action 3d I have ever seen on film, seriously this film has superb 3d and if you are a guy like me,there is a wonderful underwater dance with two girls...I was giggling like a schoolboy! To wrap it up Alexandre Aja did what films like ""Snakes on the plains"" failed miserably at , it gave us a pure 80's guilty pleasure film for the present day ..It is not the sort of gift that we will see often after this, so let's enjoy it while it's on the big Screen! If you know in advance that this is no ""Inception"" and that it's just a gory film that keeps winking at its audience and who does not take itself seriously at all,I don't see how you cant enjoy it. Serious Critic like Roger Ebert are probably going to hate it...And that means it's a really fun horror film you cant miss!",Piranha 3D
202,itsmrbigtoyou,Still not sure about it.,6,27 August 2010,"Well, after about five years or so of waiting for this Movie to happen, I finally got to see it last Friday, August 20th, after work on it's Premiere night. I went for a 10:20 p.m. showing, and my Sister, who had never ever seen a ""Piranha"" Movie in full before, came along with me. It was my 'treat', lets say.No, it really was, I paid for the tickets and offered to pay for any food, drink and/or snack items that she wanted at The Cinema.Anyway, back to The Movie, itself.I was so excited about it the whole night, I could not stop thinking about it. It was driving me CRAZY!!!!Before viewing it, that Sunday or Monday night before it's release, I had made an attempt to watch ALL of The Original ""Piranha"" Movies, plus the various spin-offs, rip-off's and cash-ins that came along with them.First one I started with was a little film from 1972, also titled ""Piranha"". It was no relation to the actual film Series of the same name(s), but I figured I'd give it a go anyway. It was so bad, I fell asleep half-way through it.Next up was the classic 1978 film, ""Piranha"", with Bradford Dillman and Heather Menzies. It had been so long since I last saw it, that I'd actually almost forgotten how good a Movie it really was! A thourough enjoyment and a well-worthy re-watch!After that, I skipped over a few nights from watching any more of these toothy Horror's.On Thursday night, I watched ""Killer Fish"" (1979) (no relation to the films, but a good little thriller) and James Cameron's ""Piranha Part Two: The Spawning, Flying Killers"" (1981). Both good, scary and atmospheric films, with pretty good casts of well-known faces from Movies and TV of yester-year. *""Killer Fish"" has: Lee Majors (TV's ""The Six Million Dollar Man""), Karen Black (""Airport 1975""), Margaux Hemingway (Sister of actress Mariel Hemingway and a relative of the famous Ernest Hemingway), Marisa Berenson (from The TV Mini-Series of The mid-1980's ""Sins""), Gary Collins (a TV personality and host), Roy Brocksmith (""Big Business"") and James Franciscus (""Concorde Affair"") in it. *""Piranha II"" has: Tricia O'Neil (TV's ""Dallas""), Lance Henriksen (a famed film actor, most notably of various American Sci-Fi pictures) and Carole Davis (""Mannequin"").Okay, okay, I know. So, the latter hasn't got the GREATEST cast in it, but none of these Movies do, just pretty good casts, with some well-known faces in them.Then, on the following Friday afternoon, I started on ""Piranhas"" (1995), a re-imagining of sorts of the 1978 film, with Alexandra Paul (TV's ""Baywatch"") and William Katt (TV's ""The Greatest American Hero"") in the lead roles. It also starred: Soleil Moon Frye (TV's ""Friends""), Mila Kunis (""Get Over It"", ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"") and Monte Markham (""Airport '77"", TV's ""Dallas"" and TV's ""The Golden Girls"")I had also intended to watch ""Mega Piranha"" (2009/'10), but didn't get to.I was all geared-up for this film, but was a little disappointed with it. It was filled with mostly soft porn type underwater footage of girls with nothing on, cavorting with each other and then the Piranha attack sequences, however few, featured mostly nothing more than bad CGI fish, jumbled, close-up's of red splashing water and then cuts of these fake Piranhas faces.The beginning with Richard Dreyfuss and then around the last ten minutes or so were the best parts and the ultimate lines, where it's revealed by Christopher Lloyd's character via radio that the Piranhas caught by The Sheriff were only babies, and then a giant Piranha jumps out of the water to attack - and presumably, kill - one of the films minor characters, were the type of scenes that made you jump and then nervously laugh at how it was 'just a Movie'.Hopefully, the next one will be a better attempt.",Piranha 3D
203,rexmagicman,"Well, if you're going to do a horror/comedy movie about man-eating piranhas, this is the way to do it I guess.....",9,4 August 2021,"Haven't watched this in a few years, put it in again tonight, and had an immensely enjoyable mindless time. It is what it is....a movie about man-eating piranhas, and it's done very well. I'm 59 years old, and saw the original in the theatre when it was released back in the late 70s -- and that movie is still near-and-dear to my heart. But I have to say, this remake works, on all levels. It's fast, extremely gory, and filled with humor in the right spots. Jerry O'Connell all but steals the film when he's onscreen, he truly captures the essence of the character, and his death scene line, ""Wet T-shirts, wet T-shirts"", gets me every time. The rest of the cast is great, with the gorgeous Kelly Brook (why did they have to kill her???), Elizabeth Shue (so good no matter what she does, no matter the role), Richard Dreyfuss in a hilarious/frightening cameo at the beginning, Christopher Lloyd doing what Christopher Lloyd does best, Steven R McQueen and Jessica Szhor as the young on-again off-again lovers --- it's a cast of memorable characters. A total popcorn flick, don't expect anything more...and if you can handle lots of blood and gore, you'll be more than pleasantly surprised and entertained.",Piranha 3D
204,daryl42-1,Exactly what it set out to be. The Citizen Kane of piranha movies? I don't know about that.,6,31 August 2010,"6.0The horror genre is not one of my favorite genres. In fact, it's almost a pet peeve of mine. I don't understand why people enjoy to see others in misery or pain. Oh wait, maybe it's like that popular saying: Misery loves company. I've also noticed that couples tend to gravitate towards horror movies. Maybe it's because females tend to show their fear, and this allows males to offer masculinity. I still don't understand why anyone would want their lives to be filled with horror. But no, that's not what you want. You don't want your kid to be eaten by a lawnmower. You don't want anyone you care about to be attacked with a chainsaw. You don't want your spouse to be killed by a serial killer. So why do you watch horror movies? Why do you fill your subconscious, and your conscious thoughts, with horrible, terrible things? So right off the bat Piranha 3D isn't a movie for me. It's a typical horror movie. It offers kills, as creative as they can get with the blood and gore. It offers sex and nudity. And it also offers comedy. Because, of course, what you want to be doing while your family is getting mauled is, of course, having sex and laughing. Wow. But I guess if you're into that kind of stuff... then good news, because Piranha 3D is a movie made for you!Piranha 3D isn't the worst movie I've seen. It looks good, and the pacing isn't bad. However, the dialogue is pretty weak. Sometimes it seemed like the movie was written by high schoolers. I guess this is OK, since the movie is basically targeted towards high schoolers. There's a scene where a group of young men pull down their pants to reveal their buttocks. Someone makes a comment like, ""This is your typical day at college."" Not mine. I guess I'm at the wrong parties... or not.The 3D in Piranha 3D is the upconverted kind, but it's not bad. It makes things that are in the distance stay in the scope of the 3D effect, whereas movies like Avatar, which had better 3D, didn't allow for very distant objects to engage in the 3D effect much.Piranha 3D isn't a bad movie for what it is. It's your typical fun horror experience, and it's a good one at that. However, I was expecting it to be something different, and I was highly disappointed. There are times when it will bore you, there are times when it will make you chuckle, and there are times when it will play with your libido. And by play with it I mean cater to it, and then completely scar it for the rest of your life. Yup. Piranha 3D succeeds at being exactly what it set out to be. There's not much else that is needed to say about this one.",Piranha 3D
205,ernesto-garcia,A Genuine Review of Piranha,8,28 January 2013,"Piranha is a 2010 horror film featuring blood,gore,and nudity,lots and lots of nudity. The film starts out with a very cool cameo involving Richard Dreyfuss. Essentially an earth quake opens up an underground lake and unleashes scores of ancient,man eating piranhas,and when did the earth decide to puke up these swimming horrors,right in the middle of spring break.Now it's up to the sheriff,and an eclectic group of heroes to save the day.There is a very cool scene involving scores of teens getting slaughtered in creative and entertaining ways.Some of the problems I had with the film was that it got a little to silly at some points,one of those points was Jerry O'Connell's death.If you love splatter movies in the tradition of 70s and 80s horror films,see this film.If you hate silly movies that are over the top and so bad they are good skip this one. 3/4",Piranha 3D
206,dim404,Unbelievably bad and corny,1,14 December 2011,"I had a hard time realizing that this film was for real, that professional people have worked with it and, most horrible, that it was a commercial success in the United States. I happen to be a friend of the US but this, ah creation, puts a strain on the friendship. If it was a comedy then I must have a problem since I found nothing remotely funny in it. If it's a horror film it didn't scare me. Some of the girls looked very good in their Eve costumes but I once again noticed that American girls have a regrettable tendency to improve on their natural endowments, something that makes me think of dairy producers. Still, I was truly fascinated by the pure bad taste of the film. It was almost poetical in it's badness, wicked people ""fornicating"", drinking and enjoying themselves and then getting ""punished"" for that by the fish... A true Dante-an Inferno,albeit in a very infantile level... all the naked, writhing bodies and the fish, The Fish.",Piranha 3D
207,fisherbee1-1,"Too much blood and T&A, no suspense or good action.",4,28 August 2010,"To start, I must say that some of the acting was good, as I expected it would be. Christopher Lloyd was, as always, fantastic, and Elisabeth Shue, Ving Rhames, and Jerry O'Connell were also good. The kids (Proulx and Ryan) were awesome. The performances by young McQueen and Szohr were far better than the script warranted. These actors, and some others, saved what could have been an abysmal failure. Most of the rest of the acting was mediocre at best.The visuals could have been far better. Beautiful blue water, clear skies, and so forth, but instead we had to watch a virtual parade of topless coeds. Now, I am sure some young guys won't mind this, but what about the rest of us? I wanted a creature feature, not a soft porn film with some critters tossed in for interest. Some of what occurred had no place in a regular theater at all.The story and direction started off fairly well, but soon deteriorated. Loved the Dreyfuss scene (and his character's choice in music), and the basic idea of how the fish got into the lake in the first place. However, beyond the basics, that was virtually ignored for the rest of the movie, which was spent on gratuitous nudity, gore, and overuse of the 3-D technology. I had hoped, since the 80's, we would have outgrown that sort of thing. Plus, many of the scenes looked far too familiar to any seasoned viewer of this sort of movie. Time that could have been spent building suspense was wasted on cheap thrills.Overall, this could have been a LOT better. Sadly, the creators of this movie chose titillation over substance. When the movie relies too much on that, there is a problem. The worst part is that some viewers seem to like this, and even expect it. Such lowered standards mean we all get less quality in the movies. Give me Jaws, or Lake Placid, or the original Piranha, any day over this. As a long-time fan of creature features, I found this one a huge disappointment. First time in awhile I was strongly tempted to demand my money back.",Piranha 3D

That of Ms. Shue's finds the corpse of the first partially destroyed by the piranhas from hell about five to ten minutes later.Meanwhile, many gorgeous, young, ""free-spirited"" girls are partying during summer vacations.

There is no ingenious plot, there won't be stellar acting and there won't be a shred of decency. So how does some hokey horror film get such decent reviews? Because it accomplishes doing what it was meant to do...being a dumb hokey horror film that you would find back in the 80s. Just sit back, don't think and enjoy the buckets and buckets of gore. There is no shortage of nudity or bloody water. When the fish frenzy starts, you really don't feel bad at all for any of the party-goers. They're acting like a bunch of assholes anyway, so you can thoroughly enjoy the ""all you can eat buffet"" scenes without any guilt. The fish attacks and death scenes are gory, grisly and hardly leave anything to the imagination. The 3D however, does not make any of this any more effective. You hardly ever feel like anything is coming at you (except for when someone throws up right onto the camera). Also, most of the ""bigger-name"" cameos don't get enough screen time. I would have liked to have seen more of Christopher Lloyd and Eli Roth...and a little less Jerry O'Connel.If you don't like bloody movies, or if you feel uncomfortable with nudity in movies then THIS IS NOT FOR YOU.

A doting Sheriff and and her trouble-loving son must stop them in their tracks before they destroy everything in their path...Review: If ever a movie title caused controversy then it has to be 'Piranha.' The 1978 original was dragged through the mud and slapped with a wet fish. The critics called it a 'shameless Jaws rip off' and ignored it's existence. Only in the last few years did people realise it is a fantastically written parody that capitalises on the seriousness of Jaws, with timeless appearances from big talents such as Heather Menzies, Bradford Dilman and Barabara Steele to name but a few. John Sayle's wonderfully explicit script and Joe Dante's tongue-in-cheek directing made Piranha a great movie that was fun, scary and which playfully played Jaws at it's own game.Piranha 3D caused even more of a stink after a nine minute clip was leaked online, the same footage that outraged the film board just a couple of weeks before the movie was due to open. The finished product is more polished and less gut wrenching than the controversial footage (MGM had a field day threatening to sue any site that dared show the clip) but Piranha 3D is by no means tame. The film pitched an R rating as soon as the previews came out and it certainly lives up to that! Piranha 3D is a loose remake of Dante's original. I say loose because other than a handful of outrageous cameo's and the piranha's themselves there isn't much to tie the two together. Artistic director Alexandra Aja (the master behind The Hills Have Eyes remake and the more recent Mirrors) ups the ante in terms of gore and fish carnage but tends to steer away from the comic element, settling for in-your-face splatter and eye popping nudity over witty one liners and black comedy. For this reason Piranha 3D is more of a straight played monster movie than a satirical Jaws rip off but Aja somehow makes it work.The movie starts on a definite high with classic Jaws actor Richard Dreyfuss appearing as a drunken sailor who mistakenly awakens the toothy terrors after causing an underwater tremor. After becoming fish food himself (in an awesome death scene) and setting the plot for the rest of the movie we meet Elizabeth Shue, a sheriff who is tired of outlandish teenagers causing havoc on the 'usually quiet, picturesque' Lake Victoria, a beautiful lake and a popular spring break hot spot with bikini clad babes and hormone ridden preps and jocks. Her own son, Stephen McQueen wants to be in on all the action but he is forced to stay home and babysit his bratty brother. Whilst Shue patrols the lake front, carting trouble makers off to the padded room for a hose down and finding maggot infested corpses, McQueen decides to sneak out and join porn director Jerry O'Conell and his porn star sidekick Kelly Brook for a bit of 'harmless' underwater ballet which ends in a bloody gag fest. Meanwhile Wet T-shirt host Eli Roth gets the party started down stream as thousands of hormone ridden teens head to the lake for drunken carnage. Pretty soon the splashing and shouting attracts the hungry fish (well, what can you say? they haven't had a meal in over 2 million years!) and before you can say 'Swim fools!' people start disappearing by the mouthful. McQueen joins Shue and Christopher Lloyd (in a bit of a crocodile Dundee meets James Bond cameo) to ward off the fish before it's too late...There are many things to like about Piranha 3D. Aja has already proved himself as a brave director after throwing buckets of blood over Wes Cravens cannibal shocker 'The Hills Have Eyes' and he steers Piranha 3D into similar waters. The movie is by no means perfect. The 3D gimmick is average and doesn't offer much to the actual screening, the CG piranha are questionably flawed to say the least and the acting is that of a typical 'B' movie. Having said that, Aja has set up some pretty awesome death sequences that will undoubtedly make you cringe and squirm and the cameo appearances from Dreyfuss, Roth and Lloyd are welcome to the genre. Fans of gore and bikini models alike will be pleased, with an exess balance of both and Kelly Brook makes a welcome appearance. To sum it up, Piranha 3D is a fun movie that shouldn't be taken too seriously. Sometimes the gore comes across as tasteless and the 'for the sake of it' nudity is a bit too in your face at times but Aja has created a good solid monster movie that will shock and entertain every time it rears it's ugly head.7.5/10",Piranha 3D
216,ssimon55,Not a bad remake,6,9 June 2012,"This was an above average remake of the 1978 film Pirhana, which was good for what it was. There was actually some plot and storyline. The acting was mediocre. There were some likable characters such as Jake, although not much character development. The story was pretty unimaginative. Basically, Jake, the son of the sheriff ditches his baby-sitting responsibilities for his brother and sister and goes to the lake to join in the spring break partying, which becomes the site of the feeding frenzy.My main problem was that the fish. While they looked cool, they did not look at all real. They looked like what they were - computer generated. All in all, it wasn't a waste of time and there was a surprise at the end.",Piranha 3D

The acting is good for a movie like this, the direction was good I actually loved what Alexander Aja did with the direction. The only problem I really had with the movie was the ending. I'm not going to say anything about the ending because I do not want to give away the ending to those who have not saw the movie yet. But let's just say they left it open with a sequel. Hopefully we see a sequel. But let's just hope it won't be as bad as flying Piranha's. Anyway go see this movie, go see it in 3D your going to love. Overall the movie is very enjoyable. But there is one scene in which one of the character's get his penis eaten off by a Piranha, then it spits back at us. The scene was just gross for me. But the movie is great.

But mammals are scaredy-cat pussies compared to the rest of the animal kingdom. Anyone who's ever woken up in the middle of the night to find a huge spider on their pillow knows all too well the feeling of involuntary bowel evacuation that often accompanies the sight of one of the more dangerous non-mammalian nature pals that we share this planet with.Piranhas may just be the most badass badasses of all species. Research has shown that a school of just 10 piranhas can strip a full-grown Tyrannosaurus Rex down to the bone in under 2 minutes, but prior to that they'd also spend several hours giving the T-Rex Indian burns, flushing its head down the toilet and making cruel & questionably untrue comments about its momma's enjoyment of degrading scatological sex acts. Vicious creatures indeed. They don't have wangs, but if they did, they'd almost certainly be expert rapists, terrorising the aquatic avian populations of the world and forcing the females to give birth to hordes of half-breed creatures like the 'pirahnuck' or perhaps the 'swaranha'. Sure, that's speculative, but I'm confident that if I proposed that hypothesis to Stephen Hawking, then he'd drool in agreement and offer me a night of passion with his most attractive female relative as payment for my brilliance.When a movie was finally made about these ultimate predators, 1978's creatively titled Piranha, director Joe Dante wisely went for the tongue-in-cheek approach. After all, how could one possibly even begin to replicate on film the sheer terror that these killing machines inspire? 1981's Piranha II: Flying Killers went some way to achieving that, by giving the piranhas the ability to fly. Flesh-eating fish with wings is no laughing matter. Sadly, director James Cameron drifted into obscurity shortly after and was never heard from again. So, the big question on my mind was simple: Would the remake go for the campy chucklefest feel of the original, or the ultra-realistic, devastatingly dark vision of humanity under attack that the sequel adopted? I won't go heavily into plot details because: A. I don't wanna give spoilers; B. You already know the plot because everyone's seen it; C. It doesn't have a plot; and most importantly D. I can't be bothered trying to explain a non-existent plot in a spoiler-free way to people who've already seen it. Suffice to say that when I pressed Play on my DVD player, the movie started. It showed a sequence of moving images featuring actors reading from a script captured on a camera and spliced together in an editing suite. Yep, it's a movie alright. This continued up until shortly after the end credits began, at which point I pressed Stop because I neither know what the hell a 'key grip' is, nor care in the slightest who performed the role. I'm told the Bluray comes with a 3D option, but from what I can gather, this is merely a visual illusion and doesn't allow real piranhas to leap from the television and devour audience members. From a marketing standpoint, that was a wise decision.With an abundance of bare tittays and cartoonish gore, this remake is undeniably fun, but only to a certain level. I'm not one to use the word 'romp' very often, unless I've been asked my opinion of the most erotic movie ever made, and in that circumstance I always add the suffix '-er Stomper'. But even if I were the type who refers to a movie as a 'romp', I still wouldn't use it here. Nor would I call it a 'hoot' or a 'blast' and certainly not a 'doozie'. It's just a slick, dumb slice of fun that passes the time in an enjoyable but unmemorable way. Even in the basic thrills stakes, I'm not sure if it lives up to the original or its sequel.All up, I'd say this is passable fun.

A number of other crazed antics including Eli Roth's head exploding and Ving Rhames carving up prehistoric piranhas with a boat motor? A big check, motherf-cker.During Spring Break, Lake Victoria is invaded by hordes of drunken, horny youths ready to party and f-ck the weekend away. Sure, we don't give a rats about anything except their boobs and possibly asses, but who cares in the slightest sense!? Anyhow, an underwater tremor sets free thousands of deadly prehistoric piranhas in the lake, and as I'm sure you've already pieced together, a fathomless wave of blood, chomping and more blood ensues as a ragtag porn crew fight for their lives amongst the madness.It wasn't as exploitive as I expected (mainly due to the barrage of hype which suddenly came in the past week), but I had a blast nonetheless. There wasn't a moment where anything was taken too seriously, and tongue was firmly planted in cheek all the way through. From the amusing cameos to increasingly ridiculous sequences, it was pure cheesy gold. This was backed up by nice glowing and vibrant cinematography, INSANE gore and a constant sense of delightful fun. The CGI was subpar, yes, but I couldn't help but deem it fitting.On the note of the renowned underwater ballet, it seems that I'm the only one who was left underwhelmed.

What a waste of money and time.... The effects are pretty good, the fish look real enough. Sometimes the water looks fake. There are a lot of 3D shots in it (like you would expect in a theme park).

The acting, directing, effects, gore, nudity, etc. were all great. There were great cameos in this movie, such as Richard Dreyfuss reprising his role as Matt Hooper from Jaws, Christopher Lloyd, Eli Roth, and even Dina Meyer. While the effects for the gore were great, the piranha were not. Obvious CGI, which everyone could have told from the trailers. They bugged me.

There is also zero tension, as the characters in this are so shallow, we really don't care about them.It is hard to fathom that the same director who gave us Haught Tension has resorted to this unimaginative drivel. Perhaps the Hollywood bean counters had more control than the director?Memo to Hollywood, CGI just does not make an impressive film, I know it's much cheaper than model work, but the end result is also cheap and unconvincing.

It's cheesy but never to the point of parody and while it threatens to go over the top, it sits at a comfortable medium of ridiculousness.It's been so long since I've seen such an entertaining B-movie of this calibre in theatres. It just doesn't happen anymore. If I have but one complaint, it's the awkward and seemingly tacked final twist ending that I'm still on the fence about.If you're turned off by how stupid the movie looks, odds are you won't think so strongly of it but for those who go in looking for a bit of fun, the movie will most certainly deliver the goods.My favourite of 2010 so far.",Piranha 3D

In the midst of the inevitable chow-down, we have an oddity for the western United States: a female sheriff (played by Oscar-nominated actress Elisabeth Shue). But she is going to have her hands full with not only the soon-to-be eaten revelers, but also her own son, who has neglected his babysitting duties with his younger siblings to take a job with a soft-porn film crew, who ask to be taken out on the lake. When the film opens with Richard Dreyfuss in a row boat, singing the drinking song from ""Jaws"", one has high hopes for the level of wit to come. Unfortunately, that doesn't happen, and the movie rather revels in shot after shot of skimpily-clad or topless young women, mixed with assorted piranha kills. There is little scope for real acting in this, and even some of the special effects look a bit questionable, but if you are the target market, it simply won't matter.

231,fire-lizard,Better than Expected,10,21 August 2010,"The trailer made the film look like it wasn't going to be very good so let me start by saying it was better than expected. The reason I decided to come see it is because of one man, Alexandre Aja. He is one of the few directors that actually remakes horror films that need to be remade and in result, does an amazing job such as The Hills have Eyes or Mirrors which is a remake of Japanese film that I hadn't even heard of until Mirrors came out.Let me start by saying the positive. The storyline is completely different to the original. In the original, you have mutant piranhas that have escaped from a lab where here you have prehistoric piranhas that escapes from an underwater earthquake so its nice to see something fresh.The acting itself was OK, even from the extras in this film. They're either having a good time or getting scared because killer fish are trying to eat them. Nearly all the women were hot, so hot it would turn a gay man straight. Elizabeth Shue performed her character very well as a police officer that wants to keep the community safe where it is drunken teenagers or killer fish and most of the other actors performed their characters well also.The 3D effects showed some fantastic scenes of gore that can actually be quite disturbing, even for a gore fan. This isn't a film for a person with a weak stomach or for kids either. It makes Jaws feel like the Care Bears when it comes to the gore. In glad it was in 3D as it made the film very suspenseful in parts as well. It caused me and the audience to have some very jumpy moments that you were least suspecting.The best part of the film was the ending. I won't say anything else but see the ending and you will know what I am talking about.The only negative thing I would say is the CGI. The Piranhas looked very cartoonish and not realistic enough. They weren't the worst effects in the world and the piranhas looked fierce enough but they didn't seem like real piranhas. Luckily, because of how the film was going, it didn't bother me very much at all.

An absolute plus of the script is its timing - the story line got a pleasant tempo and switching between locations of action, most scenes haven't been worn out beyond being interesting (including ... yeah, the underwater ballett), the script also doesn't play too much with the common shock - or fake shock - elements (after which something non-shocking happens),and doesn't forget to include a cliff hanger.
References and visual quotes to the genre are well done (see the trivia), and the usual discussions betweens someone who cries ""wolf"" and someone else ""we'd loose money"" have been minimized.
Still, I don't get, why the sheriff didn't react way faster and without compromise after the first clear evidence = piranha is caught.
At last: You might enjoy how an outbord engine can be used to make fish soup, and a whole bunch of stupid students gets ""happy-tree-friended"" and even manages to not get out of the water after 10minutes, with less than 100m to the beach, so that you get to the point of thinking: they deserve it?

This movie i guess felt like there wasn't enough T&A in movies nowadays so they went all out with it and the blood and gore. The acting? WOW...horrible.. Jerry O'Connell..holy crap was he BAD.. and i mean BAD as in some of the worst acting ever in a motion picture! I feel horrible for Elisabeth Shue..she really tried to make the best of it and even with all the naked ladies she was one of the more attractive women in the movie despite being older and fully clothed.. don't judge her acting by this stinker!..even though she was by far the best.. Ving Rhames doesn't turn down any script.. ..being a Jaws fan i can appreciate the Jaws-esque underwater shots but other than some attractive ladies naked making out underwater (apparently they need no oxygen..) what i can imagine as the first ever 3-D penis effect(thankfully i didn't watch this in a movie theater), and tons of random nudity and blood, this movie is a waste of your time..""Show me the way to go home.."" indeed...",Piranha 3D
242,Pilatunes,Incredibly bad,1,27 June 2011,"The only good thing about this movie is the astonishingly attractive Kelly Brook and the fact you get to see her in a bikini and au naturel in several fairly lengthy sequences. However, I'd suggest you look up her many images on the net and save yourself some cash.In terms of the bad, there is the complete lack of real scares. This might scare children under 5, but that's it.Then there's the fish themselves which are hilariously rendered (and, which I might add, look nothing like prehistoric piranhas...good job guys). And of course the whole science behind. I am not expecting National Geographic levels of scientific rigour but can't they at least pretend they were coming up with something plausible? Not to mention they burp like humans and roar like lions.Needless to say, you don't give a damn about the characters, all of whom are just sort of there and the remainder of which are so irritating it's actually rewarding to see them get devoured.There are times when it is hard not to believe that the people making the movies aren't secretly part of a pact to see just how bad a movie they can make and still get people to see it. This is one of those times. Absolutely, positively, the worst horror movie I've seen in a decade.",Piranha 3D

I waited for it to come out on DVD and have only just watched it, however I don't think watching it in 3D would've changed my opinion, if anything it would've made it worse. I won't give too much away, just that it's a very ridiculous story with countless events of unnecessary gore and nudity. Granted, the theme of the movie was that a porn film is being created but there was no need for most of it. The gore is literally not even funny in the end, everyone can laugh at a bad movie but the effects were so bad that I couldn't even enjoy taking the mickey out of it. Quite a depressing review but definitely not one that I would buy or watch again, even if somebody paid me. Waste of time, don't waste yours. 1/10..Just about.",Piranha 3D
245,timharries,Piranha 3D (and thank goodness),7,24 August 2010,"The first thing that struck me about this film, being a 3D ""event"" and all, was how effectively the medium was used. Let's get this right, this is a technology that started out in screamers such as ""House of Wax"" way back in the 1950s and was variously prodded at down the years in schlock like Jaws 3D and Friday the 13th 3D. Its very cinematic roots are in daft, B movie horror.That last title in particular is a great reference point for Piranha, sharing as it does the same puerile desire to locate the viewer at the heart of the splatter. Like Friday the 13th 3D, which blended the innocuous, (a yo yo spun out toward the viewer) with the gross, (an axe splitting a head in two) director Alexadre Aja also starts simple, tracking a beer bottle as it floats gradually down to the bottom of a lake, before taking things a stage further, ticking boxes marked projectile vomit, gouged eyeballs and in a first for 3D cinema, the floating appendage of Jerry O'Connell - first inspected, then spat out by one disgusted fishy specimen. (Incidently, the fish themselves should not be overlooked, their first appearance ""proper"" causing a real jump)OK, so far so good. Aja was also quick to state that this was ""nothing like"" Joe Dante's original. Really? I could have sworn I saw a couple of similarities:1. They both contain piranhas. Kind of an obvious point to make I know. One could argue that the original had more of a socio-political voice in stating that the fish were originally bred as a bio weapon against the Vietcong, but despite their beefed up CG status, it's still fish vs flesh. In the remake, they are simply ""released"", after seismic activity opens up their domain.(In a sense this is reminiscent of those old monster movies of the 1950s, where man's noisy plodding on the earth's surface prompts some gigantic ""thing"" to stir into action. Aja decides to steer clear of such agendas - clearly we're too far gone as a species anyhow) The lake splits open, the fish swim out. We are guilt free, apparently. However, the ensuing gusto with which the fish swallow down all those awful, nubile, partying teens is certainly up for debate and a much riper cause for discussing the director's own take on proceedings. 2. Both films feature a ""highlight"" scene midpoint, wherein the creatures are released upon their unsuspecting prey. (Aja simply does what any horror director would do here and amps up the blood and teeth. It certainly adds ferocity to the attacks, but the essential premise remains the same) 3. Both films contain a storyline thread wherein a child (or children in the remake) is/are in peril and need to be rescued by one of the main players. (putting them in great danger in the process) 4. Dante included scream queen Barbara Steele in a cameo in his film. Aja was lucky enough to have not one, but two such walk ons. In Richard Dreyfuss (whistling the ""Show me the Way"" tune, sipping ""Amity"" beer and directly ripping whole lines of dialogue from that ""other"" fish movie) and Christopher Lloyd - his the rather more nuanced performance, as the town's fish expert. (""When this piranha hits 88 mph you're gonna see some serious s*it!""...no, wouldn't really work)Those were just the obvious examples. The entire arc of the story maps out in a similar way in both films, comprising of: intro kill, piranhas released, race to warn those in danger, the ""bloodbath"" scene, end rescue of others, marginal destruction of fish and then the final ""but one survived"" credit closer.So these films really do seem cut from a very similar cloth. Which begs the question - why isn't Aja's version more of a revolutionary bound from the original? In short, it doesn't need to be. What is achieved here is an effective use of 3D technology, wrapped around the template of the original film. Yes, there have been some changes, but these are little more than superficial.As if to prove his statement of intent, Aja seems positively obsessed with adhering to the film's triangulate of boobs/gore/3D. Such strict adherence meaning issues such as characterization are kept to an absolute minimum. Which explains why Elizabeth Shue's lakeside Sheriff suddenly leaps into action mode, bounding from one upturned boat to the next - a gung ho switcheroo only shadowed by the scientist before her who turns full ""Arnie"" at the blink of an eye; firing up a jet ski whilst wielding a shotgun in his other hand to despatch a few of the toothy terrors. Ving Rhames' character is treated with a similar recklessness, though in this case after motor boating a few of the creatures, he's given up to be sunk ungraciously below the waves. As the film gives way to a fairly pedestrian climax, (and a particularly cynical declaration of a sequel) you're left hoping for something more, that what you've basically sat through is a lot of ""t and a"" getting minced and a few fish getting gutted in return. As a 3D event movie though, this is one of the the most entertaining I've seen and ideal summer trash entertainment.",Piranha 3D
246,mediumyale,"""Pirahna"" doesn't bite hard enough",4,14 October 2010,"""Piranha"" certainly has a sharp sense of humor, but the exploitation elements are blatantly overwhelming and preposterous at times. Sure, the film knows what it is and doesn't try to be more than the fun, B-like horror film it wants to be, but it has a difficult time mixing the comedic and horror elements. Overall, Piranha spends more time exploiting the stars, exploiting big-breasted women, exploiting the college-party lifestyle, exploiting the over-the-top gore, exploiting CGI (Computer Graphics), and don't forget, cashing-in on the ridiculous 3-D gimmick. Instead of inverting these concepts into a clever good time, the content remains utterly EXPLOITIVE, no more and no less, rather than standing as a cool homage to the original, and B-horror cinema in general. The fact that this film doesn't use stop-motion or complex make-up effect takes the charm away from the B-horror effect. Roger Corman produced the first ""Piranha"" (1978) to cash-in on the whole Jaws-rave of the mid-to-late seventies. In addition, the original ""Piranha"" had a witty script written by the independent maverick, John Sayles, and at times, was truly frightening. This new ""Piranha"" is all-around silly. Some of my favorite B-horror films were made by writer-director Frank Henenlotter, a genius at combining horror with comedy, along with some very inventive stop-motion effects. He wrote and directed such cult, B-horror classics as ""Basket Case"" (1982), ""Brain Damage"" (1987), and ""Frankenhooker"" (1990). These films came out before the CGI craze, and are a good reminder as to why CGI ruins the charm of stop-motion or make-up effects. When the audience sees that a certain effect is created by a computer, it's really hard to ponder the gory creation, or how inventive the director had to be in order to create an in-camera effect. I think there are some instances where CGI is absolutely necessary, but today, I think special effects artist depend too much on it. Sometimes, CGI can really take me out of the realm of the cinematic experience, and the illusion is completely ruined. Most importantly, ""Piranha"" is not an original creation; it's your run-of-the-mill remake. Question: How many remakes do the studios manufacture every year? Answer: So many, I just stopped counting.",Piranha 3D

If the audience is going into the theatre and thinking of watching another Inception you will be horribly disappointed but if you enjoyed My Bloody Valentine you will think this is better. You see some classic actors and you will see some classic actors die a gruesome death. Great movie for a date and great to watch if you have no expectations.

As many other reviews have already explained, the acting is, well, mediocre at best, but that's not what this genre is about really is it! For those whose childhood contained films like Jaws and even Back to the Future, it's great to see some familiar faces (all be it for not that long) in this movie doing what they do best. I honestly thought that the same Doc character from B2TF had found his way onto the script, he's exactly the same! Perfect for groups of friends the film will probably not endere itself to the older generations, indeed during some of the many nude scenes in the movie I felt rather uncomfortable sat next to a more mature cinema goer.There are 5/6 moments in the film that will stick with you and your friends after you watch the movie for sure - namely 3d genitalia in various states of disrepair..ouch.On the whole (which is where quite a few bathers get bitten by Piranhas..sorry couldn't resist) the film will satisfy those looking for a light-hearted movie which doesn't take itself too seriously, almost like the 70's run of zombie movies to be honest. It provides plenty of laughs throughout but anyone looking for great acting performances and an innovative and in-depth story should steer clear.",Piranha 3D
250,DVDZombie,Describe Piranha 3D in one word...bad.,3,12 October 2010,"The casting is horrible, the soundtrack is terrible, the special effects are worthy of a Syfy channel movie and the story is so stereotypical you can literally predict what's going to happen in each scene.One question kept nagging me as I forced myself to sit through this train wreck. Why are Ving Rhames, Jerry O'Connell, Steven McQueen, Jessica Szohr and Cody Longo even in this movie? It's almost as if someone wanted to take the worst of the worst and give them screen time. With Mcqueen, Szohr and Longo in it the movie looks like an episode of a CW series gone bad...and that's saying a lot because most CW shows are terrible as it is. Why you would cast such whiney, emo looking actors in anything I have no idea but where this movie is concerned I can only assume the entire casting budget was blown on Richard Dreyfuss and Christopher Lloyd, so the CW crowd was all they could afford.As for the effects, don't expect much. If you've seen one of those really low budget Syfy channel movies then you've seen these kinds of effects before. They look worse then a video game cut sequence and you can spot them a mile away. The studio even went to the trouble of using CGI on the beer bottle in the opening sequence, all the fish and the majority of the under water shots. How nice of them. The few times you see any real effects work like blood and gore type stuff, it looks horrible. I'm pretty sure I've seen better makeup on twelve year old's at Halloween.Do yourself a favor, go watch something from about twenty five years ago. It'll look better, cost less to see and you won't feel completely ripped off by the time the credits roll.",Piranha 3D
251,Jonathan Maxwell Reeves,Just a chicks and tits movie...,1,24 December 2011,"How on earth is it possible that great actors like Richard Dreyfuss and Christopher Lloyd have lowered themselves to be part of a movie like this? It's a real mystery to me. The original Piranha from 1978 and directed by Joe Dante is a cult movie in its kind. This remake is just a ""chicks and tits movie"". You clearly can see that this movie wants to exploit the 3D hype. In the theaters with your 3D glasses on it might be fun to see two naked women doing a water ballet for 5 minutes and all those D-cups floating in front of your eyes might make you drool, but in the 2D version at home on television it all becomes boring after 30 seconds. The only thing that remains is a very bad screenplay. The actors do not play like cardboard playing cards, they actually are cardboard playing cards. The only exception is Christopher Lloyd, who once again plays a kind of Doc Brown character as in Back To The Future, but just like Richard Dreyfuss he barely appears for a few minutes in the movie. They should feed the director of this movie to the piranhas (alive !!!) just as a precaution so he will no longer be able to rape cult movies in the future.",Piranha 3D

I was definitely right about this. I'm not pleased with the 3D in the movie but I was pleased with the amount of action the movie contained. Nonstop girls and violence is a great combination. This isn't exactly any Oscar winner production but it definitely earns it's place on the list of most entertaining 90 minute movies.

255,sorrow,Delightfully gruesome and fun film!,9,20 August 2010,"I really loved Piranha 3D and had a blast at my midnight screening. There was never a dull moment for me. The first half while relatively quiet compared to the second half is funny and filled with bountiful shots of spring-break revelry and aesthetically pleasing nudity that's all in good fun. The set up for the characters was competently done and even though no one is going to win an award for best acting here, there was no example of distracting bad acting and the cast sold their two dimensional characters. We get enough development of our main characters that they aren't just generic nothings when the carnage starts.Once the second half kicks in, Aja takes the film into overdrive and throws one jaw dropping gruesome set piece after another at the viewer. My audience was roaring with laughter and clapping at gag after gag whether it was the ""ballet"" sequence with its beautiful eye candy (worth the ticket price alone) or some of the nasty goodness that Aja sends our way during the gory chaos of the film's second half. Despite the overall humorous nature of the material, there were still some tense moments and a few places where you find yourself in the curious position of both laughing at and feeling unsettled by what you're seeing on screen.Aja perfectly captures the tone when he says it is ""Gremlins for adults"".I expected skillful direction from Aja, and he delivered. He uses his skill at building tension that he put to frightening good use in Haute Tension in a different way here. Often, he will build anticipation for an over-the-top gag by telegraphing and then delaying as you ask yourself whether he's really about to go where it looks like he's headed and then ""Bam!"" he really does go there.In addition to delivering the goods and delivering them well, the film also gives us several pleasing nods at other genre films and fun cameos from Richard Dreyfus and Christopher Lloyd.

Some nice cameos including Richard Dreyfuss and Christopher Lloyd poking fun at their previous roles and Jerry O'Connell seems to relish his over the top role as a bad boy porn director. Piranha 3D knows what it is and doesn't try to be anything else which is rather refreshing and as such it delivers what it promises.

257,robin-mckay80,A Very Mixed Bag,6,30 December 2010,"This was a very mixed bag for me - It was nice to see Richard Dreyfuss in a cameo role - a really nice homage to his character Matt Hooper in Jaws - its a shame they couldn't have made a Jaws 5 with him in it, but never mind.The film starts well - Dreyfuss is the victim of a violent attack and it sets up the tone for the rest of the film, but it must be said I wasn't quite expecting it to be as it was, despite its 18 Certificate.In truth, the actors and the characters they portray aren't anything much to write home about - the acting is pretty standard at the best of times and Elizabeth Shue is so-so in the role of the main protagonist, even though it feels she isn't.I thought that the younger actors actually did a good job in the film - Jerry O'Connell's character comes over as annoying. Despite the fact he's meant to be like that in the film, he was annoying none the less but he does have some good moments. O'Connell is not the greatest actor I have had the pleasure to see on screen and feel that he's pretty one dimensional.It was great to see Christopher Lloyd on the screen though even his performance reminded me of the mad scientist and was reminiscent of his performance as Doc Brown in Back To The Future - he didn't give this part variation which is why I kind of felt I was feeling deja-vu. That said, Lloyd is a fantastic actor but here, it somehow just felt slightly wrong but I like Lloyd as an actor and feel he does bring a presence to the screen.The Piranha aspect was one of the highlights of the film and make creditable antagonists which is why we've come to see the film anyways. The attack scenes are particularly effective yet somewhat gory and there is a bit of humour thrown in, especially with O'Connell and the loss of one of his assets, though I won't dwell too much on that, but makes for one of the most amusing, yet unexpected scenes in the picture.As I explained, the film itself is distinctly hit and miss, perhaps just slightly more hit than miss, but unfortunately, you can't feel that you can get too much into the film because you're always going from one extreme to the next. Its not a poor film, but not anywhere near as effective as it could and maybe should have been under the circumstances.I'm looking forward to see what the sequel can offer.",Piranha 3D
258,SCIFIshant,"Quirky, Weird, And Unique!",7,24 June 2018,"I get it. This film might not be for everybody, but that's the point! This film pokes fun at the horror classics such as the JAWS series. The whole point of this movie is that it tries to be weird and cheesy on purpose and that if you go into it with that mindset you will have a great time. The story starts off when a teenage boy wants to work with this weird film producer who wants to produce some suggestive material. Anyways this boy's stupidity gets to him and he basically ends up leaving his annoying little brother and sister on their own. Little does he know that the waters they are filming on are infested with killer Piranha's and an extinct species of Piranha at that! Christopher Lloyd who played Doc.Brown in the Back to the Future series stars in this film as a scientist which was an amazing touch. Just seeing him in this film brought a smile to my face. Getting back to the point the Piranhas keep breeding and end up smelling the scent of swimmers and they end up eating them in gruesome ways. Some of these scenes while being cheesy really did freak me out which is what a horror movie is made to do. At the end the boy and (most of his friends) are saved, but they end up finding out that there is a massive Mother Piranha which is breeding the smaller Piranhas. The story while being quirky and strongly reminding me of an 80's horror film was interesting and there was not a single dull moment. The visuals for the most part were decent. The one pet peeve I have is that the movie tries to be way too edgy by showing lots of suggestive imagery and featuring loud hip-hop music. I personally thought that was jammed into the movie and that the film could live without it. There were some bad CGI effects in the beginning, but for the most part I thought the Piranhas looked extremely cool and gave the film much needed charm. Those bulging red eyes, scaly skin, and sharp fangs made these creatures goofy yet spooky at the same time. The music was not that great for a film of this type to be honest. 80's pop music or 70's disco would have done this retro style story justice! The acting was okay. It was no Blade Runner,Jaws or Empire Strikes Back in terms of acting, but most people would not notice the cheesy sequences. Overall I really enjoyed this movie and would recommend it to any horror or comedy fan. It is a movie that one might hate and one might love! You will have to watch it and decide for yourself.

If full tilt gore is not your cup of tea then don't watch this film.I watched the 2D version and to be honest I didn't know what to expect. I had seen the original years before but had not even seen the trailer for this one before watching it. I was in shock. I don't think I've seen this much gore on film ever. Every single kill of these deadly fish is shown in detail. The movie teases you for awhile with a few of these and then throws an extended massacre scene at you that I, at least, was not expecting.You get not one, not two but three people cut in half. You get the so-realistic-you'll-wince scalping of a girl. At least one graphic beheading and an endless series of people being munched on later, you find that the movie isn't over yet.Don't get me wrong. It is a very fast-paced film with a fair amount of dark humor. Oh, yeah...there's also a ton of naked ladies, including the supremely beautiful Kelly Brook.I've always been a fan of blood splatter horror so I enjoyed this film.

260,kellycastlebridge,"Went for the 3D nudity, stayed for the fun!",9,12 September 2010,"I only went to this movie because of the great underwater nude ballet scene in 3D that everyone was talking about. There has been WAY too much male nudity in movies over the last 2 years and virtually no really good female nudity. So it was about time to show my support for a film that has some good female skin for a change.The nude scene did not disappoint! Nothing like two beautiful naked woman showing it all underwater. There was even a brief flash of the pink taco. My only complaint is that they didn't show enough female genitalia. It bothers me that several Hollywood movies have showed full male genitalia, including clear close-ups of the penis and testicles, but we never get to see a clear shot of the vulva. We usually only get non-genital nudity of women (breasts and butt) in mainstream movies. Even this film (that sold millions of dollars worth of extra tickets due to the gratuitous female nudity) didn't show a clear shot of female genitalia (the labia/clitoris, or anus) Why can movies like Bruno show a semi-erect penis close-up for 10 seconds swinging around and even show the dick-hole, but we never get that type of graphic, close-up female genital nudity in a mainstream movie? In any case, I went to the film because I wanted to see that beautiful, underwater ballet scene. The thought of it in 3D was enough to get me to shell out my $12. (Sure, I could have stayed at home and watched a soft-core porno instead, but that isn't on a 40-foot screen and in glorious 3D!)The FEMALE nudity was great! We definitely need more of that. It might not be ""politically correct"" and the feminist crybabies might whine about it, but it sells tickets.However, I was also pleasantly surprised at how fun the movie was! It was supposed to be a bit of a spoof on the old 70's/80's horror films. The type that had over-the-top gore, lots of gratuitous female nudity, and non-stop action. It succeeded. Its not meant to be a deep, intellectually challenging masterpiece.....just a fun time. Lots of thrills, chills, blood-spatter, and naked girls.

261,Maxelle,Piranha What Do You Expect???,8,5 September 2010,"I'll start off saying that I enjoyed Piranha immensely. I feel compelled to defend it against people who just blindly hate it. And yet they don't even realize what type of movie they are watching. It isn't The Hurt Locker or Shutter Island. It's a move about piranhas chomping on Spring Break vacationers. It's a cheesy Horror Cinema at it's best.I'll start with the cons. There are few. The 3D was decent at most times but some shots were really blurry and out of focus. Something I can forgive as I just wanted to see it in 3D for the theatrical experience. (2D for all future re-watches and there will be plenty). And it stops there.Here are the pros. Just about everything else. The wooden acting (By some not all), the over acting, and the under acting (Yes, there is such a thing) all made it that much more hilarious as a horror comedy. The effects were great, the piranha looked fine, not realistic but they weren't supposed to look realistic. The gore was top notch and Aja proves, again, that he has the power to craft a powerful horror movie. Piranha at times is tense and disturbing as well as comedic. The cinematography was beautiful and showed the beauty of Lake Havasu (In the movie it's called Lake Victoria).Please do not skip this movie due to the negative reviews. Instead see for yourself and enjoy it for it being a schlocky throwback to the 70's and 80's. Watch it in 3D in theaters to have a blast and re-watch it in 2D to remember it well.",Piranha 3D
262,kriskoppy1961,Absolutely Terrible,1,28 August 2010,"Evidently, movies have become so pathetic that the ""F"" word has to be used in excess, nudity has to be splattered all over the screen, and well known, decent actors have to debase their talents by ""acting"" in this crap. From the very onset, this film attempts to lure the viewer with stupid naked women. Evidently, women can't lure a man anymore without showing all they have in public. Again and again, and again. I was hopeful that this film would be a decent remake, but in fact, it was pathetic. I found myself hoping the piranha would start chewing on people so I didn't have to see their fake boobs and listen to the overuse of the ""F"" word. Surely people don't actually talk like that in public, around elementary school children as portrayed in the ""film?"" Please, don't waste your time or your money. This is a plot less, pointless, soft porn blunder that fails to produce even the smallest drop of tension, drama, or fear. I miss the days when women had some self respect and men treated women with dignity. I guess this film demonstrates that all women are is meat to sleep with and all men are is brainless, sex starved idiots. YUCK!",Piranha 3D

The only incredible thing about this movie is that there are actually people here that liked it, in fact a few said it was the best horror film yet.I don't mind nudity in films, but after this movie I had to wipe the nipple prints of my TV. The movie is just plain tasteless. There is no real story here, the action is just lame, the acting is mediocre.

I went into this movie knowing that it is going to have a b-movie feel. Though I wasn't expecting how awesome the CGI melds with the awesome makeup gore effects nor was I not expecting how FUN this movie is. The movie really holds on to it's campy feel and goes all out. You really should see this movie in 3D to get the full cheese drive-in movie feel. The movie is just one murder set piece after another and does it well. There is great comedy too and the movie never takes itself seriously and has a light tone. I was laughing throughout- It's gross out with little spook here and there .Trust me after seeing Piranha 3D You'll almost feel that they turned flesh ripping and breast shaking 3D into an art form.,Piranha 3D
265,Filmazer,A forgettable experience...fortunately.,4,23 September 2010,"This is a difficult movie to review because I did not feel like I was watching a movie. It had no plot, story or any characterization whatsoever. It felt more like watching prehistoric piranhas have their buffet at the aquarium. It was fun for about 10 minutes.There was no sense of urgency, since the human bait is just that, human bait. The characters were either dumb, selfish or horny and you just didn't care for them. If it was done intentionally as social commentary, then it was a rather poor one.I always like to joke to my girlfriend that if you cannot make a good movie, then throw in some nudity for the guys, they'll love it no matter what. Heck, I guess I was wrong. I couldn't even enjoy that in here, given the ample boobies screen time. Sorry guys, I really tried.",Piranha 3D

I loved High Tension and I even liked Mirror(a solid remake in my opinion), which a lot of people seem to hate. Now on with the review: Aja took a different route for Piranha 3D. Instead of the serious and intense thriller horror films he's been doing with his previous films, he's doing a horror comedy in this one.I personally compare this film to Dead Alive(Braindead), except gorier and bloodier. Yup, you heard me: BLOODIER and GORIER than DEAD ALIVE. Hard to imagine or believe isn't it? Well it is. Plus the usage of the blood completely proves that this movie used more gallons of blood than Dead Alive. Don't get me wrong; I'm not saying this movie is a BETTER film than Dead Alive, I'm just simply stating that it's got way more blood and gore than they had in that whole movie.As far as story, try not to look for it. I mean for Christ sake, it's about KILLER FISHES. So don't expect a movie that will enlighten you afterward. This movie is PURELY for entertainment, but GREAT entertainment regardless.(It's like Michael Bay's films, except way more entertaining and actually good)If you're the type of guy craving for blood and always complaining that movies nowadays don't have enough blood, watch this movie because you'll be seeing red throughout the whole movie.

Sure the acting was a little cheesy, and the graphics were not the best, and the storyline was nothing special but the movie was hilarious. The whole audience in the theatre was happily laughing along to all the funny comments and jokes that were stuck into the movie. If you expect a lot from this movie I would not recommend it, if you expect nothing more than some nudity, and some blood than you are going to be pleased because that is about all the movie offers.",Piranha 3D

I mean how dyu go wrong with tits? this movie wasn't the smartest movie in the world, but with the name like 'Pirhana' you can't expect much anyway.I didn't think they brought out the violence enough. at no given point did i go like 'daaaang that must hurt'.CGI was bad. and no one should watch this in 3D.

It would've saved me from the experience of watching on of the worst horror movies ever. The acting, true it's not bad, but it's stereotypical to the horror genre. The special effects aren't very special at all, they stink worse than a carton of milk left on the kitchen table for a month! The death scenes are unmotivated and not very logical, and with the terrible special effects they look extremely unrealistic. The plot reminded me a little of Jaws but it certainly did not have the qualities of Spielbergs 1970's horror/thriller! Sure, the half naked girls jiggling their business all over the place is a huge plus for the movie, but even that is not enough to compensate for the horrifyingly crappy movie. My advice DON'T watch this movie. 2/10!!!",Piranha 3D

All the chemistry was just right, everything from Christopher Lloyd's zany character teasing the angry Piranha, the beach feeding frenzy to the nasty piranha chomping n then spitting out the xxx. The piranha design is good, especially when it stretches out its fin when it's angry. It's really funny in so many ways. The acting was ok to me, the inclusion of Jerry O'Connell was a really good casting choice for me. He was very hilarious when he was saved up the deck.

It's the perfect blend of gore and humor, with a ton of nudity thrown in.Piranha 3D is not scary. If you want scary, see another movie. The acting was solid. Jerry O'Connell's character was completely over the top! The only way to describe it is over-acting...again hilarious! The piranha were really wicked looking, as I'm sure you've seen in the trailer, not fake at all. Some of the gore, was really good and gross. Some not so good, but with the timing and action it worked well. The water, mountains, and caves were gorgeous. There is actually a decent storyline going on. the first part of the movie gets slow at times. when it's slow it's filled with either quick gore or slow long gratuitous nudity shots. When it stops being slow and hits, it hits hard! It is pure gore! I know kids watch horror movies, but this movie is not for kids at all. there is so much gore and blood...tissue... bone... muscle... sinew... It's disgusting, very graphic. Then there is tons of nudity. I cannot stress the amount of nudity. You know if it's your kind of movie or not. I loved it!

This is not a movie to be taken seriously at all, and I think that if some people understood that, they'd enjoy it more. Its a remake of the 1978 film of the same name, but its different. The setting is a remote lake in Arizona, which is a hot spot for Spring breakers. Obviously you know what happens from there. People get eaten, and its up to the town deputy (Elisabeth Shue) to figure out whats going on. There's plenty of gore, and lots of nudity.

""Piranha 3D"" might not be the best film out there, but pretty damn close! For starters, it's got big names you're already familiar with: Shue, Scott, Rhames, Dreyfuss, O'Connell, among others. Then there are the newbies (McQueen one of them), and then the porn stars (Riley Steele, Gianna Michaels, etc.). But the movie doesn't rely much on star power. In fact, it hardly even does. What it relies on are its CGI killer fish, which in my opinion, were really impressive in the way they were were brought to life in the big screen. The way they move is realistic enough, although in some points in the movie, you can tell they're - well - CGI. But I don't care, they're cute nonetheless. The 3D. Honestly,I never got to watch this in 3D, so for those who've seen it in 3D, you decide for yourself if it's worth it. And the blood. Oh the blood. Remember that Comic-Con footage they removed because it was too bloody? Well, that was nothing compared to the whole scene. The real cinematic scene is WAY bloodier and more disgusting than anybody could have imagined. That was just about 1/9 of the movie. The remaining 8, well, let's just say I won't give them away. Congratulations to Alexandre Aja for directing such a fine piece of cinema. See it, don't see it, I don't care. For me, I loved it, ""Piranha 3D"" kicks all other killer fish movies' butts!Rated R for sequences of strong bloody horror violence (REALLY STRONG) and gore, graphic nudity (REALLY GRAPHIC), sexual content, language and some drug use (WELL, NOT REALLY).",Piranha 3D

The action was fast paced, the acting was suitable and propped up a few standout actors. The cinematography mess well with the subject matter. It was at times really in your face but without the god awful shaky cam effect that has been so popular in recent cinema.I say as far as fun Summer horror fare employing the so overplayed 3D gimmick, Piranha 3D goes down as an instant classic.

277,packfanman,Entertaining and Gory,7,21 August 2010,"The one thing that ""Piranha 3-D"" did wrong was actually cast Jerry O'Connell in his role -- if he would have understood the character was a parody of the kinds of characters he usually does rather than playing it straight, he would have been much more entertaining instead of grating. Also, since characterization isn't really a big concern of the filmmakers, Ving Rhames is too underused, even though he has a good time with a boat propeller. And, the younger children should really stay away -- not because of the gore, but the ample T&A on display. Elisabeth Shue works well as the face of the law trying to keep order during chaos, as well as fun cameos by Richard Dreyfuss and Christopher Lloyd.

He's got it all for this film: movie-sadism, movie-tension, movie-intellect, so why doesn't this film quiet work? Maybe it's because the humour & teasing-pace sobers the 3D. Perhaps?Basically, what we have here is a schematic genre-movie. The 3D disappointingly offers very little (apart from Ms Brook, which admittedly is both tasteful & beautiful). So, technically, everything delivers but emotionally this film fails on all levels.

280,ashleybelsham,Will you people stop taking everything so seriously!!!,9,1 September 2010,"OK.First can I say the worst thing about IMDb is when you get some kind of Media graduate with a big head analysing fun and silly films and criticising the cinematography and the lack of subliminal thought etc etc. If you want to see a BAFTA winner, go and watch some period drama or something.If you go into a film called ALIEN vs PREDATOR or FREDDIE vs JASON, its gonna be what is says on the tin: quickly made, lack of story, but lots of gore, a joke or two and maybe (these days) a heavy metal sound track.So when you go and see Piranha (whether you know about the original or not) you know what your gonna get. Its everything you need: funny bits, gore, a few tributes to legendary classic horrors and best of all Doc out of Back to the Future is in it. Woop woop. Very tongue in cheek so don't panic Media students.The main criticism but lots of people on here is that there is a serious amount of boobage in it. But its a JOKE for gods sake. Its a play on the fact that originally in horrors there was always a breast or two about. Get over it!!! If any of you people really think any one man would be turned on by this film you are fooling yourself. I for one didn't find the naked bloody half torso attractive at all even tho it had a boob on it. If men want to be turned on they can use the internet like everyone else.OH YEAH...........ONE LAST RANT...............i wish they would STOP making films 3D as an afterthought. Lots of films like this one do not really need to be 3D. I think its very cheeky of the film industry to make us pay even more for a film. The 3D in THIS particular film was not worth the extra money. The new Resident Evil film looks as if that HAS been made with 3D in mind. I wanna go see it.Anyway....in summary........really good story. Quick to start with the gore and jumpy moments. Very funny. Good stuff. If you like a laugh, a scare and blood then go see it.

281,jo-erg,It is what it is,7,22 December 2010,"An horror movie has to have certain elements to be good: a virginal hero or heroin that survives at the end, an almost invincible villain, some nudity, some sinners that die during the film, and some blood. Mix all this together and multiply it by 5 and the result is ""Piranha 3D"".The story centers on a local boy, Jake, who's mother is the local sheriff, and who has to take care of his small brother and sister instead of going to the great party that is celebrated every year in his town, Lake Victoria. He leaves his brother and sister alone to go to the lake with some girls and have a good time, the problem is that an earthquake has released some prehistoric piranhas that lived in the subsoil of the lake, and they are very hungry of human flesh. Now, the local sheriff(Elizabeth Shue) must safe his family and the entire town from the underwater menace.The plot doesn't go further, it is actually simple and ridiculous at the same time, but the result is an entertaining movie that covers every expectations.

The 3d was underwhelming, the plot was average and not really that interesting, and it was actually kind of slow the first half. I am glad I did not pay full price. It would have been just fine as a late night offering on Cinemax. A few cuts above a SyFy Saturday flick, but not a whole lot. Funny, because I watched ""Frankenfish"" on TV earlier today, and it was nearly as good as Pirahna! Now, I don't mean to sell it short.

286,bubbsy2,Om Nom Nom,10,12 September 2010,"When I went to go see Piranha 3D I was hoping for blood, nudity and mayhem and I got all that in an amazing amount. While it is certainly no great masterpiece when compared to films such as Shawshank Redemption or an epic tale like Lord Of The Rings, it in no way is trying to be. I see this movie as a masterpiece of it's genre, it delivers everything you expect from a film of this type and I would go so far as to say it is one of the goriest films I have ever seen.You are thrown into the massacre within the first 2 minutes of the film with the Piranha devouring a seemingly sweet little old man in a violent frenzy and there on in it just keeps getting more brutal. The scene with all the spring break kids was so blood, screams and loss of limb filled every time you blink there is literally a new victim, its all just a frenzy.One thing I really liked about the film was you really felt that anyone could be eaten at any moment, the only exception being the two kids. I honestly did not expect Danni (Kelly Brooke) to die and for the first time that I can remember, I was actually sad about the death of a pretty girl in a horror movie, this time I was rooting for the girl, not the monster. Though some off the deaths were a tad predictable you were never really sure who was going to be devoured next and it kept me in suspense.The characters were all acted perfectly. Kelly (Jessica Szohr) did a great job as the love interest, she acted well and you could feel the fear in her voice when she is stuck on the kitchen counter. She also has a rather different look to most love interests in this genre, she has a relatable beauty, she looks like the kind of stunning girl you could meet in everyday life. Derrick (Jerry O'Connel) was fun to watch, a man of a thousand faces and personalities depending on his mood, what he wants and what substances he's just abused, your never sure if you want to punch him or hug him, but he is brilliant at providing the comic relief, the line when he is pulled from the water is priceless, half dead with his lower half stripped down to bone and all he can think of is his penis. My biggest surprise was Danni who was actually genuinely friendly and not a bimbo, a rather odd phenomena considering she is very attractive and in a horror movie, but thats what's so clever about the movie, it uses clichés but turns the bad ones on their heads and while using stereotypical characters, the film makes you like the ones it wants you to and hate the ones it wants you to so you are affected in the way the director wants when each characters fate is decided, whether it be they live or they become fish food. I truly enjoyed this film, it had me racked with suspense at some bits, laughing at others and bewildered by the amount of gore and the sheer size of the massacre at the rest. I loved every moment right up to when the credits rolled and I'll also add that I did not expect those piranha to be the babies at any point, mainly because my mind was so bust trying to take in all the boobs and blood it could handle. People may try and compare it to Jaws but I don't see how you can do that fairly, Jaws was a serious film, this is not. Jaws was considered violent, bloody and terrifying in its day, and the only comparison I would make between the two is that Piranha is most likely considered as violent and hectic as Jaws was considered back then.I can find no fault with this film, in fact the only thing I would have liked to have changed about my experience at the cinema was where I chose to sit because every time an attractive girl came on screen (about every 15 seconds) some creepy guys behind me kept making odd noises :P",Piranha 3D

That movie was good because it combined horror, comedy and gore without abusing special effects, resulting in a enjoyable B movie that is nowadays a jewel.Piranha in the other hand is awful and shallow: good actors who act badly, abuse of FX, and a trashy plot.If you wanna see some junkies, boobs, a bitten ding-dong, bogus science and lots of blood, watch this crap but think twice: there are plenty of XXX movies with a better plot and better actors.",Piranha 3D
292,tygressuk,Great Fun,10,31 August 2010,"I loved this film, was truly great fun, OK the storyline was a bit lame, but the film had everything, Richard Dreyfuss (virtually using his character from Jaws with his 'show me the way to go home' music and saying lines like Fast Fish). Had awesome underwater sequences which looked fantastic especially with Riley Steele and Kelly Brook :D. And had so much blood and gore in it wow amazing. The massacre sequence was outstanding on the big screen, but one thing that really miffed me was the use of 3D??? Where was it?? The film could easily have been shot and released in 2D it wouldn't have made any difference (Apart from costing less to watch), Still i suppose cant have everything, I thought it was the best thing I've watched this year tho, Kept me totally entertained with the gore and comedy. PS Still cant get my head around how Elisabeth Shue had a 17yr old son tho, She looked far to young.",Piranha 3D

(Something I don't usually do let's just say)When I saw Kill Bill, I felt truly robbed of 2 hours of my life, I have seen some utter sash, especially as I live in France (you should see the TV here) and I have seen just about every horror film ever made; but this... this film is amazing at being awful. You know, there are some films that are bad, and then you get other rare films that are so bad it's funny, but oh my god... This will make you want to hurt yourself. It's a whole new level of ****Awful & cheap CGI effects, stupendously bad acting, and possibly the worst story ever. But to cap it all off, no-where near as 'good' as the original. This garbage is neither funny, scary, inspired, artsy, it can't even manage to be bad.

No Story no good script no Character Development whatsoever also has one of the lame-est ending i have ever seen...This movie plays off as a big budget girls gone wild episode with some killer pirhanas thrown in almost as an afterthought...while some of the gore affects were nice and nasty looking..a lot of the Cgi stuff was utter crap..Even the so called 3d wasn't in 3d and it shows just like Clash of the Titans..There is a few good points to the film Elizabeth Shue who did a good job and the Richard Dryfuss Cameo was Clever..however other then that this movie sucks..If they had spent more time working on a good script and giving us Characters that were worth a damn and less time or even no time on nudity and gore the movie would have probably been better...Thank god for the Original being on DVD because i can go and watch that and see what a good film is all about...Again Gore and nudity do not make a movie,Piranha 3D

I am happy they cast some more 'serious' talent as to make everything a more invested effort. At the end, I wanted more but I was eventually happy it stopped where it did (it's more fun that way). I think maybe I think I desired some closure (not sure if I look forward to a sequel or prefer it ended just the way it issalut Coen bros). My biggest criticism was with the cgi in the opening scene when the piranhas were feeding in the ""whirlpool"" on Richard Dreyfus. They were not well engineered. A bit more effort could've been put in on that one It was fun to see Eli Roth exactly where he was in this film. I'm fascinated with his bloody film roles. (My jaw is still on the ground from Inglourious Bastards.) As an electronic music fan, I was actually quite pleased to hear the tunes. A good remake, made me jump more than a few times. Even though I didn't really find anything funny I did rather enjoy the film for all intensive purposes. All in all, I think it was a success for cult/horror fans alike. I do think it deserves a retro-cult status.",Piranha 3D

I expected a flick from this movie, but considering the director and his previous movies ...it wasn't a disappointment at all. It has a lot of gore and filled with tension! The bad reviews came from ...probably ... people that don't like too much blood in their movie. Or too much nudity was offensive for a lot of you out there, but there was a spring brake at A LAKE, where people are as naked as possible, trying to have a lot of fun with a lot of ...orgies. You know? Like in our days ...So the ""porn"" parts where actually soft because in real life there are much more stupid and irresponsible teenagers. Many people in this movie deserved to be eaten!

This movie, walking into it, looked like it would be an okay film with some scares but after i was laughing at all the death scenes with both delight and horror. I have never seen so much blood in a movie in a very long time and this amount of nudes ina R-rated movie since the 80s. Plus an all star cast that would convince even the snobbiest of critics to see this gore fest. Even Hooper from jaws makes a cameo as the unfortunate first victim of these hellfish. I highly recommend you see this movie.Bottom line: Piranha 3D delivers with a bite!!!",Piranha 3D

I just thought that i would have a good time. Within the first 15 minutes of the movie, i regretted my choice. I get the point that the director took a chance; I love 70s & 80s horror movies. The opening scene of the movie felt like i was seeing one of those old movies. But as I kept watching, I got totally disappointed. The visuals were not too bad but most of the time when a person died or something big happened, the whole theater laughed as if we were watching a funny movie. I was laughing and also could still not believe that i was wasting my time with this. Probably i should call out to all females from here; your boyfriend, brother or husband would enjoy this movie a lot. So don't be trapped if they try to trick you into seeing this film. Because the movie has so much soft porn visions. And you might not stand to look at your own boobies for a couple days.

The 3D effects were bad, nothing worth mentioning about the CGI. As far as the plot is concerned, this movie is actually worse than any average SyFy made for TV Piranha film.A completely irrelevant 'girls gone wild' type subplot may ruin whatever is left to enjoy, for family audiences. Not sure why this is not rated X or NC17. Strictly for teens who enjoy spring break type excitement. Parents will be really uncomfortable if they take there kids expecting a horror movie. There is absolutely no horror involved. Just wanted to warn anyone expecting an action thriller.",Piranha 3D

Much better than I expected.3D effects were cool, especially involving the gruesome scenes with the Piranhas.Under water nude lesbian scene was done with great taste, such an ironic scene to a campy, over-the-top, professionally done sardonic tilt to all those old stupid teen beach movies. I laughed through most of this movie, had to cover my eyes for a few parts and felt anxious at times, as the unexpected continued to happen in this movie, I had no idea what to expect, like, who would get eaten next.

Like Jaws meets Lake Placid with a touch of Snakes on a Plane, but bite size! (Pun intended.)

306,wraith7216,possible spoilers,10,20 August 2010,"Caught the 11:59 show last night. This movie was frickin AWESOME!! The piranha attacks were brutal and visceral. The trilling sound when the fish attack was replaced by the sound of razor sharp teeth tearing flesh from bone, the way it should be IMO. All the actors did a good job, particularly Adam Scott. Jerry O'Connell and Paul Scheer delivered laughs in every scene they were in. Chris Lloyd had a great cameo, channeling Doc Brown from the Back to the Future flicks. The film opens with Richard Dreyfuss and an awesome nod to Jaws. The only small gripe I could make is that the underwater cave scene was a bit too dark. But that complaint quickly falls to the wayside as the movie kicks into overdrive with the spring break attack that makes storming the beach in Private Ryan look like a day at Disneyland. As a previous poster said, don't go into this movie expecting Schindler's List. This isn't about deep, character-driven drama. This movie is about hopping on a roller-coaster, throwing your arms in the air and yelling WOOO-HOOO!! If your looking for a fun, scary, and humorous way to spend an hour and a half, then get to your theater, grab a big bag of popcorn and strap in for a hella-fun ride!!",Piranha 3D

It will shock you. if you're going to this film expecting to see minimal gore, you are wrong. If you thought a killer piranha flick would be mild, what were you thinking? The amount of gore is huge, but with a shock film, how could you complain? The nudity was over the top though. There is a plot, people trying to survive a piranha attack. This is a cheesy horror flick, nothing more. This flick is not for kids. If you don't or didn't want to see piranha tear people apart, why would you even consider this film?

Most of the scenes seemed realistic, but the fish themselves were not even remotely life like and that disappointed me. After seeing impressive CGI in movies such as Transformers, I wish this could have been stepped up upon. I felt the overall plot was good and the actors including the extras were excellent. I would have rather the feel of the movie to have been slightly more serious and less campy. The scene with the girls ballet swimming could have been shortened or deleted without effecting the movie, and I thought the fish consuming the penis was a little too much, especially when the fish spat it out half eaten. I also did not like the final scenes after the mother went to the kids rescue and they couldn't get the girl out of the sinking boat. The movie lost my interest at the point here the young man untied the line from the boat, tied it on to himself and begun his scenes to save the girlfriend.",Piranha 3D

Anyway what makes piranha 3d so good; A beginning including a prized cameo from Richard Dreyfuss (who plays his part tongue in cheek to wonderful effect), a well paced middle building up towards the piece de resistance - the attack scene, with such overblown music to bring back memories of Apocalypse Now ""I love the sound of barely pubescent teenagers screaming in the morning."" The knockabout comedy on board the Love Boat leads to hilarity ,suspense ,sqiumworthyness and a nerve-shattering climax.What more does one need from a motion picture I'm sure in years to come this will be up there with the Rocky Horrors showing forever at Late Niters as one of those cults that some scoff at and others equally revere much to the chagrin of those nonbelievers who just don't get it?!!See this movie and remember film is all about enjoyment.

I do think that this movie is actually a great film since Jaws since there's haven't been one quite like it, and it is also a great movie to be joined with American films. The story line is very well because usually movies like this take place with like toxic waste or mutants but this one was well thought of. Other that being a comedy movie the special effects to make this horror movie was fantastic and I'm not just talking about the piranhas which were horrible but the special effects makeup and dummies were great. I think the director did a horrible job but it was also the actors, the only actor that even had a chance of amusing the audience was Jerry O' Connell and he's not that much of a good actor in my own opinion.

Movie starts off with ""Matt Hooper"", the same guy that played ""Matt Hooper"" in Jaws, being attacked and killed by the killer Piranha's...hows that for Irony!? He is even singing the same song that him, the cop and the fisherman from Jaws were singing when they were drunk. I thought that was a cute touch. Movie contains a LOT of nudity....this in my opinion was border line NC-17. I laughed my butt off when the 2 girls did the under water dancing naked scene. Not really a scary movie but good for a laugh...there were a couple parts that made me jump but mostly a laughable movie.The only part of the movie I thought was cheap was the scene where all the swimmers are trying to climb onto the floating Stage and it ended up falling over. TOTAL RIP OFF!!!! If anyone has seen the movie SPRING BREAK SHARK ATTACK made in 2005, you were seeing dejavu. The only difference between the 2 scenes was the monsters attacking the people.

Using it again in this film made this concept ridiculous.Most of the actors are lame. Well, I don't think most of them are actors. They're more like porn stars. The film, as a whole, is made of stupid characters. I mean, the film was made of very, very stupid characters.Like most SciFi films, the movie focused too much on the monsters and the killings leaving too many chance for mistakes and inconsistencies.In terms of gore, the film did an excellent job because I was totally disgusted by the film.

I really don't understand how people can watch the trailer and still expect a blockbuster and even be shocked about the many half-naked chicks in it. Wake up guys... You can't expect a movie without naked chicks if half of the trailer shows naked chicks. And for those who don't know what Spring Break is... well, just take a minute to google it. And for those who are disturbed by the level of blood and gore should try the Disney movies or something like that. This is a piranha movie after all and blood and gore is the only thing one should be expecting from a movie like this.For you who haven't seen this movie yet I can only say: Take a good look at the trailer and expect the movie to be like what you expect of it after watching the trailer. I mean, you can't really expect an Oscar- winning movie from this trailer, or can you? Just enjoy the 90 minutes of blood, gore and naked chicks and have yourself a good time without having to worry about missing parts of the plot.Now I gave it 10 stars but thats only because all those immature reviewers who probably are traumatized by the mix of blood, gore and hot chicks and gave it a 1 star rating. This movie deserves more.My real rating: 3,5 out of 5 for doing what I expected from it after seeing the trailer. To be honest it even delivered a tad more than I expected. Just go and watch this movie if you enjoyed the trailer. If you didn't enjoy the trailer then you should stay away from it I guess.",Piranha 3D

The kills were amazingly original, and very bloody. The cast is surprisingly awesome. Each character is fleshed out. Elisabeth Shue does very good as the tough, but caring, mother/sheriff. Ving Rhame is beast as the her old deputy/friend. We even have the late Steve McQueen's grandson, and cameos by Richard Dreyfuss and Christopher Lloyd. But Jerry O'Connell steals the show as the porn director/snob Derrick Jones. The Sfx and make-up by Greg Nicotero and Howard Berger is the goriest I've ever seen.

And there's also the spice, a group of people trying to shoot porn movies on the lake with the local boy as the guide. I don't understand why they put so many 'naked lesbians' scenes in this movie because I think it will be so much better without those. For parents, just don't take your children to watch this movie. I didn't watch this in 3D but I don't think watching the 'naughty scenes' in 3D will be appropriate.

317,kittywonghf,Horror is not to be mixed with Sex.,2,28 February 2012,"This film was... horrible. I never paid to watch 3D or an expensive version of Piranha -- and to be honest, I don't regret that one bit.Horror / Thriller films are one of my favorite categories. Although this movie does provide a lot of blood and gore everywhere, it is more like a showcase of a big chaotic mess than really having the audience getting scared of what is possibly under the water at this very moment. Compared to 'Jaws', Piranha is not very successful at all in plot. Although the CGI in Piranha was not bad, it does not provide the same thrilling sensation of discovering the absolute horror of the threat (In this case, the great white and the piranhas). Besides, the piranhas were already discovered too early on -- as the film progressed, I doubt that was anyone that couldn't guess what's going to happen to the bunch swimming in the sea.And the second part is... the sex. If Piranha had stuck to the horror portion in its plot, maybe I would have given a higher rating such as 5 or 6 (still not going to be very high) for the sole effort given to it -- but the nudity of women and several sexual R-rated scenes had turned me off severely. We know it's summer, but isn't the part at the beginning enough? Do we really have to watch nude women kissing each other or flying in the sky with a parachute throughout the movie? I, for one, paid for the horror aspect of the film. In my opinion, it is fine to set a scene with limited graphic pictures, but as the same things emerge throughout the film, it becomes quite annoying and irritating since, and I repeat, I didn't pay for the pornography portrayed in a horror film.The sickest part is probably when a piranha eats a penis and throw it back out all chewed up. The nudity and sexual innuendos included in this movie totally kills the horror and the audiences' expectations of the film.2/10",Piranha 3D
318,mrnasher,Something fishy.,5,17 March 2012,"On paper.. I should have loved this film. It delivered the kills.. Boy did it deliver on kills.. Plenty of sexy ladies and scenes designed to show them off. The film appeared to be ticking off all the campy horror clichés with rather good production values on top... How can it not be a winner.The trouble was hard to put a finger on while watching but hindsight really brings home the faults.Just about every character is unpleasant, criminally negligent and deserves a fishy death (A typical horror flick trope) but instead of just being a justification for deaths.. they manage to include our would be heroes in the same set, leaving us with little connection to anyone.The nudity is gratuitous and after a while decidedly unsexy.. There's no passion or even voyeuristic joy in it when the boobs and butts are just there on screen, usually with the pretext of being shot for a porno. And that's the rub.. porno is sexy.. filming it.. not so much. Using porn stars obviously helped the film makers get some of the nudity they needed and I think we all know that kind of actress are rarely gifted actors with dialogue and Brooke's performance is deadening flat. Gianna Michaels comes off best where she has no lines and is used for her famous assets, that should have been the case for all such roles.The story itself is okay.. They give context and setup the creatures and don't get over excited with long explanations but do the setup some service.. its a shame that the main body of the script is just meh! The so-so plot combined with the unengaging characters really deadens the pace and had me wanting to skip ahead over scenes to the action. This movie could be a lot of fun for the gore fan, just campy enough to be enjoyable and thankfully steered well away form the torture porn genre and back to the films this flick has it's roots in. Also I can't praise the inventive kills enough..they embraced the panic and when it's not the atheism the human are equally effective killers. It's just not enough to cancel out the terrible story and characters.",Piranha 3D

And the blood and gore was so over the top, and the ending just was like wow, can not wait for the sequel. The acting was great. The corny characters were perfectly hammy, while the serious actors played it straight and realistically.

However, what starts out as fun in the sun, soon turns into a bloody and horrific nightmare as a massive school of pre-historic Piranha begin to attack the Spring Breakers after being released from their submerged ravine that was opened up by an unexpected underwater earthquake. ""Piranha 3D"" is a 2010 Horror / Comedy remake of the 1970's classic Joe Dante film by the same name, and is released through Dimension Films. The movie is directed by Alexandre Aja, produced by the Weinstein Brothers and is written for the screen by Josh Stolberg and Pete Goldfinger. This 2010 Summer flick was a commercial success, and has a running time of just over 85 minutes.Elizabeth Shue leads the cast as the sheriff of Lake Victoria, Julie Forrester; with Steven R. McQueen co-starring as her teenage son Jake, and Ving Rhames playing Deputy Fallon. We have Adam Scott playing Novak Radzinsky, a marine biologist, and Jerry O' Connell portraying a sleezy porn video director, Derrick Jones. The movie also lands Christopher Lloyd as Carl Goodman, a local fish emporium owner and fish expert, and Richard Dreyfuss as Matt Boyd, a fisherman and the first unlucky victim of the deadly Piranha. In other supporting roles, we have Eli Roth as a Wet T-Shirt Contest Host, Kelly Brook and Riley Steele as Wild Wild Girls, Paul Scheer as a porn video cameraman, Brooklynn Proulx and Sage Ryan as Julie's two young children, Jessica Szohr as Jake's love interest Kelly, and Dina Meyer and Ricardo Chavira as Novak's two underwater diving assistants. This film also has Cody Longo and Brian Kubach in the film as minor character roles. First and foremost, ""Piranha 3D"" (2010) is a Horror / Comedy. That being said, expect to have over-the-top death sequences and guilty pleasure humor that will make the movie a tad humorous; without crossing the border into being cheesy. This movie does have its fair share of Suspense and Horror, but at the same time, you can cringe, fear for the characters, sit on the edge of your seat and last but not least, have fun along the way with a slight smirk upon your face. The film could have been horrible, but director Alexandre Aja saved the project and turned it into a fun Summer ride that is packed with thrills and chills. However, please do not let your children or anyone else under the age of 18 anywhere near ""Piranha 3D"", because make no mistake; this movie is piled high with Nudity / Adult Content, Language, Graphic Death Sequences and Alcohol / Drug Use.Overall, I enjoyed ""Piranha 3D"" and found it to be one of my favorite films of 2010. I'm not necessarily a fan of all films belonging to Alexandre Aja, but he did a good job on this project. The cast was put together decently, and the screenplay / storyline was clever and interesting as well. I would recommend this film to young adults, college students or anyone just looking for a movie to watch that contains a good blend of Horror and humor. Therefore, I feel that Alexandre Aja brought flare to the Horror / Comedy genre with ""Piranha 3D"" (2010)!8 / 10 star rating",Piranha 3D
321,noahmilomatt,The goriest movie ever!!!,10,27 August 2014,This movie is absolutely GORY!!! It is so fun to watch and it has so much action and comedy. I was in tears at some because they were so funny. It was So worth 4 bucks and it's horror gold for a collector like me so I highly recommend buying this! Don't even hesitate with this because it doesn't disappoint but be warned there is a lot of boobs so don't watch it in front of your parents kids. But seriously it is really naughty. Basically in a nutshell this movie is about an earthquake that opens a crack in the ground which releases prehistoric piranhas trapped for millions of years! And they go on a rampage and pile up twice the body count and blood I've ever seen in a movie! The comedy mixes so good with this movie too. I just can't even say how much I love this film. I'll be writing more reviews but peace out for now!,Piranha 3D
322,john_naughton,You get what you pay for,10,5 August 2020,"Is this film amongst the best that cinema has to offer? No of course not.However for what it is, people getting eaten by piranhas, it's the best on offer.For me this is a 10/10 because for this style of film its exceptional. It has everything (including amazing cameos from Richard Dreyfus and Christopher Lloyd) Don't let snobbery put you off, this film is incredible!",Piranha 3D
323,seraphino,"Gory, Disgusting, Offensive...But all in Fun",6,20 August 2010,"So I just got done seeing this movie and the first thing I have to say is ""Wow!"" That wow is good and bad; firstly, parents should really make note of what people are saying here, this is definitely NOT for KIDS!! I would even go so far as to say that it is not for adults with a weak stomach. The amount of gore, nudity, and disgusting content in this movie shouldn't have warranted an R-rating in my opinion; it was quite possibly the grossest movie I have ever seen; and I have seen some pretty disturbing movies.On top of that, the acting was fairly sub-par, but, what can you expect from a movie filled with d-list cast members? While some scenes were very convincing, other scenes were so fake and unrealistic that this film could even be considered a dark comedy. This goes for some of the scary sequences too, because they looked so forced in order to make the viewer jump, it was very unconvincing.The second ""Wow!"", I say because while this movie is disturbing it is all in fun. The movie is gross, yes, it is terribly acted, yes, and some people would say that this film is not a film that shouldn't have ever been made by mankind. But, for those attracted to gore and extremely gruesome creature horror/comedies. This is right up your alley.",Piranha 3D
324,sugarspunsis-1,Not bad....,7,31 August 2010,"***********************MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS*****************************This movie is not actually that bad at all. I think if you had the benefit of growing up through the good old 70's/80's suspense flicks, you can definitely say the film is a testament to that era. I mean it references so many horror flicks which I loved, most prominently Jaws and of course its predecessor 'Piranha' back in 78. Starting with Dreyfuss' homage to the tune of 'Show me the way to go home' from the famous boat scene we all love to remember, right before meeting his demise from the toothy fishies. Underwater shots are reminiscent of Jaws too, the way the camera lingers and makes you shiver with the fact that there is something lurking and waiting. The characters are very strong too and there is no corny lines or sluggish acting whatsoever. The characters develop as the movie moves along too, which is a rarity in todays horror genre. You can almost feel for their struggle, which is different from other so called 'b - movies' where you just want the heroine/hero/character to die and the lights to come back on. Im sure that many viewers can sympathise and say that they have seen worse? I certainly have. The amount of garbage I have seen in remakes made me very hesitant at first to watch this, but by doing so, I wouldn't mind seeing other horror remakes being directed by Alex Aja. I think the support from a horror heavyweight such as Eli Roth was of benefit, but withstanding he may just be the next big thing in horror.",Piranha 3D
325,strmf,"1000 teen boobs and even more blood, guts and gore.",3,5 October 2010,"This was a total waste of time. It was one of the worst movies i have seen this year and i have seen a lot of them. There was so much blood and guts and gore and bones and yes let us not forget boobs that this movie should have been called ""Boobie land turns snuff"". Each second of this movie was so perfectly predictable and so forward that i almost fell asleep by the end, end that was 100% cheesy. If you are not a huge boobs movie fan you can go see ANY other movie with the same theme and enjoy it just the same. Bad plot, bad acting, OK special effects and the only good part of the movie was that you can bathe your eyes in tons of boobs. Did i mention the 1000+ boobs?

326,nichols_donald,This film should have never happened,1,15 January 2011,"Piranha 3D is an insanely poor remake of a camp classic. Poor Kevin McCarthy is probably flipping over in his grave. This version was only made with one thing in mind,BOOBS. The original storyline is completely lost for the sake of gratuitous nudity. I was an extra during the San Marcos, Tx location filming of the the original. We did not have to rely on nudity during any of the shoot. This new version doesn't even remain true to the original plot line. The 3D aspect of this film also fails miserably. Until the technology improves it will be best left to theater screens, as opposed to home DVD. The cast, crew, and writers should be ashamed of themselves for even making this lousy film. Don't waste your money. Buy or rent the original instead.",Piranha 3D

This is one of my favorite Horror / Comedy films!",9,31 May 2012,"An underwater earthquake opens up a large subterranean lake / cavern system beneath the surface of Lake Victoria, Arizona during Spring Break; unleashing a massive swarm of deadly prehistoric Piranha! In order to prevent the mutilation of thousands of innocent but reckless college students, Sheriff Julie Forrester (Elizabeth Shue), Deputy Fallon (Ving Rhames) and the local police department team up with both Marine Biologist Novak Radzinsky (Adam Scott) and fish emporium owner Carl Goodman (Christopher Lloyd) in order to destroy the flesh-eating and merciless Piranha that will viciously attack at the first hint of blood. However, realizing that they are too late and the Piranha have begun to attack all of the unsuspecting Spring Breakers, Sheriff Forrester discovers that her teenage son Jake (Steven R. McQueen), her two younger children Zane (Sage Ryan) and Laura (Brooklynn Proulx), a careless pornographer by the name of Derrick Jones (Jerry O' Connell), his cameraman Andrew ""Drew"" Cunningham (Paul Scheer), Jake's college love interest Kelly (Jessica Szohr) and Wild Wild Girls Danni (Kelly Brook) and Crystal (Riley Steele) are trapped on a sinking boat where the Piranha have begun to attack and terrorize them as well. Will Sheriff Forrester save her children and save the day? In order to find out, you must watch ""Piranha 3D"" (2010); which is one of my favorite Horror / Comedy films.""Piranha 3D"" is a 2010 Horror / Comedy film directed by Alexandre Aja (The Hills Have Eyes, 2006), is written for the screen by both Pete Goldfinger (Sorority Row, 2009) and Josh Stolberg (Sorority Row, 2009) and is released through Dimension Studios and the Weinstein Brothers (Halloween, 2007). With a running time of 88 minutes and a solid ""R"" rating by the Motion Picture Association of America, ""Piranha 3D"" (2010) is an indirect remake of the original, 1978 film by director Joe Dante (Gremlins); containing, in my opinion, an almost perfect blend of both Horror and Comedy. Alexandre Aja has managed to create a movie where the audience can both be scared and sometimes laugh at the exact same time; with somewhat over-the-top death scenes that both put a sly smile on your face and will make you cringe all the same. I enjoyed the fact that the creators behind this 2010 remake added both a small story and a blend of character development as well. I personally thought that the actors and actresses in this film delivered good performances overall, and the opening cameo appearance with Richard Dreyfuss (Poseidon, 2006) in his blast-from-the-past role as Matt Boyd from ""Jaws"" (1977) was quite entertaining. The main massacre scene halfway through the movie, where the college students are under attack by the Piranha, was wickedly gruesome and contained edge-of-your-seat sequences as well.However, I did feel that this movie contained a few scenes of unnecessary nudity; specifically with the Wild Wild Girls performing an underwater shot for the camera. Another scene that, in my opinion, was unnecessary as far as the nudity was concerned, was when a girl is parasailing and is dragging her breasts in the water at the same time. With the exception of those scenes, I feel that Alexandre Aja and the cast and crew did a surprising and great job with ""Piranha 3D""; making the project a perfect popcorn Summer flick for the college and adult atmosphere. In conclusion to this movie review, I felt as though the film's ending was quite creative and it definitely surprised me as well. Overall, I give ""Piranha 3D"" (2010) a 9 out of 10 star rating.""Piranha 3D"" (2010); Elizabeth Shue, Steven R. McQueen, Jessica Szohr, Jerry O' Connell, Adam Scott, Ving Rhames, Kelly Brook, Paul Scheer, Riley Steele, Sage Ryan, Brooklynn Proulx, Dina Meyer, Christopher Lloyd, Ricardo Chavira and Richard Dreyfuss.",Piranha 3D

The start may trick you into thinking that it may not be ""that bad"", believe me, if your IQ is over 80- 90, you will be gasping for air and trying to leave the cinema before it reaches half-time. It is so bad that it makes B-movies masterpieces. The ""story"" fades away into outer space in the first 10 minutes, after that all there is to it are boobs and gore... and even that makes no sense. I can't believe they actually released this crap, it should have went directly to DVD. I won't bother with an actual review because others have written better ones, I will just advise you to keep your money, and, if you insist in having your intelligence and common sense insulted by seeing this movie, find a way to see it for free, or you will be really sorry.

329,patrickmondolis,A piranha ate the script,1,14 March 2011,"Honestly, people, I did not expect anything special from this movie, and I don't think anyone of you did, but what i didn't expect was that it was going to be as awful as it was. I would go for sh*t, but then again, I don't want sh*t to feel offended. Yes, the cast wasn't anything special, and honestly, I think that the girls who had one shot to show their boobs did a better job in front of the camera than most of the actors, but once again, all of you must have been expecting that already. Not even Chrisopher Lloyd saves the movie! What I have against this movie, and the main reason I chose to write this review, is because of it's utter stupidity, which sinks into the pile of garbage the crew confused for a script. Or it might have been the awfully crap-looking 3D-CG piranhas. Besides, if you look back on the previous piranha movies, you'll notice that this is a remake of a remake. I thought that at least the piranhas where going to look good, but oh boy, I was completely wrong. Everything about this movie Sucks. and I am not going to pinpoint all of the CGI crap, all of the unnecessary floating eves and heads, and everything else having to do with ¨special¨ effects, what i am going to chomp on is the humongously horrible script. I mean, I can take the abuse of 3d in this movie. ie.: *The 3D flying soda *The 3D-slow motion vomit *the 3D bob cutting chord *3D bits and pieces of piranhas getting chopped by a motor boat. *I can even take the 3D penis thrown at my face, eaten by a piranha, and once again regurgitated at my face! But what i can't take is:* Ving Rhames shooting piranhas in the air. There's two thing to that: the fact that he is actually shooting all of them, and the fact that they are for some reason jumping in the air. These are not dolphins, they're piranhas, they don't jump out of the water!* The huge explosion which kills all the piranhas clean off, but doesn't kill the guys right next to the fish.* All those stupid little things, including:-The ""coincidential adequately positioned boats"" the sheriff mother jumps on until she gets to hers.And there's s much more, but do I really have to keep going, because it seems enough to me just with what's on the top of my head right now. Anyways, if you're planning on watching a movie, even if this is the only one left for you to watch, DON'T WATCH THIS ONE! Under no circumstances expose yourself to this so-bad-it's-AWFUL piece of crap. In fact, I've heard it's radioactive, and your penis shrinks because of watching it. And if that didn't convince you, then go watch it, but I hope you die after watching it, not because you didn't follow my advice, but because after being exposed to this sh*t, you're better off dead, believe me.

I was so mad about it that i spend my money on this kind of movie. For starters the movie is about piranhas as all of you know. But the 3D effect in the beginning of the movie is very bad, i mean bad as in your brains start to melt. I think the movies is so bad acted that you can start crying. And there are a lot of thing that you can expect. Actually you can predict the whole movie. I must say the only thing that was good about the movies where the couple of jokes. So if you combine the bad 3D the extremely bad acting and the ending that you don't expect not because of a good plot but because it stop in the middle of the film.

This movie was so great that I have seen it twice. It is exactly what a horror film should be only better. It is funny, and gross but done so well. I was so impressed when I saw it. Alexandra Aja has done it again. I would have said High Tension was his best, but I think Piranha has taken that title. He has proved that he is a force to be noticed. Wes craven beware, there is a new horror director in town. The music was awesome in the movie and the cast was hot! If you wanna see some skinamax this is your movie.

I'm sorry, but there's nothing funny when you hear a dude yell ""he bite me penis off!"" and then to see it actually float in the water...

333,david-820-890493,B- Movie Cliché with Boobs and Gore galore.,8,25 August 2010,"This is the kind of movie that refuses to stop indulging in B-movie clichés Alexandre Aja delivers them non stop unashamedly where other movies of this genre stop.It never loses sight of what it is trying to do which is really simple. Have fun! It delivers it in droves and just when you think it couldn't go any further or get any more ridiculous it keeps going. The acting is 2 dimensional as it needs to be, but if you go to watch this you are not expecting Oscar worthy performances. All of the actors do a great job of establishing their characters and run with what they have.Richard Dreyfuss appears at the start of the film swiftly followed by Elizabeth Shue as the sheriff both names and people that we recognise, Christopher Lloyd appears as a half baked slightly crazy fish guy and is 2 steps away from being Doc Brown again. There is enough nudity to satisfy a playboy pool party. Even with a 5 minute underwater nude ballet scene that really has nothing to do with the plot at all but it all adds to the good fun of this title, when you think that the boobs have stopped coming out to play they pop up again!There is enough gore for anyone and the CGI on parts works well, the Piranha's perhaps don't look that convincing though this could be due to the added 3D effect upon them. What the CGI lacks in the make up department more than makes up for no pun intended. This film delivers everything you expect it too, don't go in expecting a deep thinking title or getting frights like you would in a horror/thriller its not that type of film its unashamedly B-Movie cliché and is a lot of fun. If you are lost for something to watch and want a laugh and not take life too seriously for an hour or 2 then I'd recommend this without hesitation.",Piranha 3D

It verges on porn and should have a NC17 rating!!!I can't comment on the 3D b/c I have a rare eye condition that doesn't allow me to see 3D. The person I saw the movie with did say the 3D was horrible and only a few scenes were shot in 3D. First off, the movie should be rated NC17. The graphic female nudity was over the top...more than your typical full frontal nudity. Some sexual content that is expected from horror franchises these days. And a severed penis just to mention a few things without spoilers. The movie is not funny and is not scary. If you are a horny teenager who likes campy blood/gore that is not scary - this is the movie for you.The underwater shots were dark and bloody, so you couldn't see much. It was not scary, not funny, and not entertaining. I did not flintch once, I didn't laugh once, I wasn't entertained at all. In fact, we almost walked out; but for $13 each because it is only showing in 3D near our home, we decided to see if it got better. Unfortunately, the amount of bad got super worse. The ending was ridiculous and predictable.I hope I can get the word out so no one else goes to see this crappy movie. I am a huge horror fan, but this is not horror for the big screen. It verges on pornographic nudity and campy gore that doesn't look real/scare you. I know it has its place in the horror genre, but it should have gone straight to video with the likes of Antichrist and Razortooth and Camp Blood.Alexandre Aja did a wonderful, scary, well-directed, unpredictable movie called Tera Haute (High Tension in English). High Tension was phenomenal. I expected the same from him with this movie. Obviously, Aja took the money and spent it on durgs and alcohol for him and his crew, because there is no way anyone in their right mind would think this movie would be great on their resume or on the big screen.

Like we have PIRANHA 3D, in the near future there will be ads depicting ""Love in London -2D"" only 2D flick in town. First impression, this is just another creature-feature movie where the director has no other motive than scaring the hell out of audience to his best. Piranha has some new angles too. Like the skin show in 3D which i am sure most of us hasn't seen before. Film is definitely not for all eyes including the ones aged below 18. Script is as simple as the golden rule like the 1.Problem 2. Explanation of problem 3. More problems 4. More & More problems. 5. Hero and all his family are safe. and 6. A twist in the end. Come on, how many movies we have seen of those kind. However, PIRANHA-3D has some scenes which are worth half of your money at least. Visual effects are totally convincing. Sound department went easy on the audience not to scare too much. Its very ironic that a few minutes before the movie i was at my friend's place admiring the beautiful, calm fish in the aquarium there. I wonder how people who love fish will react to this movie? The fish weren't just savage creatures in this movie. They were given character like in movement, hunt and choosing their kill. You see, they always find their way to most ""beautiful spots"". I ended up with mixed feelings during the movie. Tell me how would you feel when you see a hot chick with nothing but little things on getting munched by violent beasts under water .....and in 3D....??...May be its a question only for the ""gentlemen""?Strange thought that one might end up feeling hungry during the movie.

I really do not know why this movie actually is rated over six, because this is the biggest piece of s*** I've seen in my entire life. There are a number of reasons for that, but the main reason is that the movie has no soul, there is nothing that binds me as a viewer to it and it doesn't give me anything. It is supposed to be scary and funny. The movie is none of them. Just really sad.Sure, the movie has a lot of boobs and butts. I can understand that is has to be some shots of it, especially since it is a Spring party in the movie. But a lot of the scenes is just odd and painfully long. At times you forget what the movie is really about. Yes, what was it again? Seriously, I am not sure. It is like the director of the movie did not know what he was going to fill the movie with to get the exact length, so he just threw in some random, long body scenes.The story alone is boring and very little creative. ""During the annual Spring party by 50,000 young revelers is about to turn into a feeding frenzy with prehistoric hunger-pains."" The fact that some prehistoric piranhas has come out of a crack in a rock of an old lake is fair enough.

LOADS of blood, extremely ugly blood-thirsty fish and sexy women, all in a crazy vortex of entrails, screaming and hilarious one liners. A really stupid flick I can't help to love!",Piranha 3D

For example: The scene that came out the two girls naked in the water left over.And also it was a little gore, which leads us to throw popcorn.The end I did not like ... dead piranhas and suddenly no more, leaving a large piranha that eats the man and the movie ends.The special effects were real good!I hope that they get the second part!In short: less porn and more action!",Piranha 3D

There are also some naked/nude scene, beers, many beautiful chicks. An interesting to see for adults man I think.Pro: thrilling, gory, scary, sexy woman, nice boobs Cons: Still some event/scenes does not make any sense, no logic in it. Like, for example the piranha can live under cave without other animals by only cannibalism.But anyway, it is worth to watch for anyone who likes movie I described above.",Piranha 3D
345,Garb3,"Watchable, as long as you don't take any of it seriously.",5,14 July 2013,"I'm not going to call Piranha a terrible movie, but let's make it clear that you certainly shouldn't go with high expectations to this one...or really, any expectations at all. A reboot of an old franchise that nobody really wanted, Piranha is a shameless 88 minutes of blood, weak acting and of course, naked girls. Most of the scenes would honestly be more at home in a bad porno than what is supposed to be a scary movie (the underwater make-out scene is the pinnacle of this).But Piranha fails as a 'horror' not only because of this but also due to the sheer ridiculousness of the whole premise; in terms of realism, it's in the same league as the later Rambo films. The piranha themselves are laughably bad, again about as believable as a five-headed alien monkey called Bob. To be fair though, if you do just want a silly movie to laugh at and you can look past how stupid the whole thing is, Piranha is pretty fun, and definitely not the worst of recent movies. Even so, if you are in need of something casual that you can watch without any need to think, there are still a lot of better titles out there.",Piranha 3D
346,qarn,Best movie of the year BY FAR!!!,10,29 August 2010,"Yes, better than Inception. This movie was thorough enjoyable, very predictable,..but in an age where plot twists and philosophising seem to be the cinematic approach du jour its refreshing to get some nonsensical butchery mixed in with a heavy dose of female eye candy. Although I thought Inception was conceptually a brilliant movie,...I can say unequivocally that Piranha was a far more enjoyable experience for me. I've heard it being compared to Jaws,...I think Piranha is a far cheekier movie and is meant to entertain rather than scare. I've heard old timers say that they couldn't go into the water for weeks after Jaws first came out,...on the contrary Piranha made me want to go to the beach one last time before the summer is out. *******************Spoiler************************ They should have an Oscar category for most absurd/ridiculous/entertaining scene of the year.

I knew starting this movie I wasn't going to walk away calling it great. I also knew that it wasn't meant to be taken seriously and that it was all in good gore and fun... and for that I love it. It is ridiculous and energetic the whole time. I honestly didn't think I'd like it as much as I did. If you love the movies the SyFy Channel has but think the special effects look fake then see this movie.

I have never seen any of the Piranha movies so I cannot compare it to the others, but I really don't understand how any movie can be worse than this one. It started off reminding me of a wonderful movie called Jaws, I thought it was going to be very entertaining. Well I was soon proved wrong with scene after scene of nudity. I can deal with some nudity, but I didn't come to watch a porno. Well, I did manage to deal with the movie, then came the gore. Again I can manage with some gore, but the constant ripping of bodies, private parts being torn off and zoomed in being eaten by the demon looking piranhas and the limbs just laying in the water really did me in. I would say most of this movie was unnecessary and I don't really understand how it can be considered a movie at all. It was a torture porn. I left early because I could not stand the movie in the least, I felt like it could have been made a good movie, well possibly, if they didn't focus on the nudity and blood. Seriously, the movie is called piranha's not sex and missing limbs. Waste of time, don't see this movie it's not worth what you have to pay for movie tickets. It really isn't.",Piranha 3D

I agree, it's not a very intelligent flick, it has a lot of nudity and a lot of gore...but.. is this a bad thing about a popcorn horror ?? First of all I really enjoyed the special effects.. it reminded me of old school horror, I mean I didn't see the CGI (maybe just the piranhas) it was all very real. The suspense is great, it keeps you on the edge most of the time, has some very well directed scenes really hard to watch at times, and the cast is great, especially Jerry O'Connell who is very fun to watch.

And most of the way it delivered exactly that: Cheesy lines, unnecessary boobies shots and annoying stereotypes actors. Even Christopher Lloyd annoyed the hell out of me.I usually watch a lot of horror movies which includes gore films. Therefore nothing shocks me at all anymore. Many of these gore horror movies are too easily made and they all lack a certain quality which some directors have now realized (i.e. Tucker and Dale vs. Evil). So they use comedy or something like that, so the movie become more than just easy gore.I expected this movie to have nothing of that kind of ""extra quality"". And it didn't. BUT it did have one very large scene where the piranhas attack that blew completely away! That one scene is why every horror movie buff out there HAS to see this movie.As said, nothing shocks me anymore. But that one, incredible scene was mind-blowing!

No solid story line, your not emotionally drawn to the movie unless you like naked girls getting hacked to death by fish. Just terrible. Sure the 3D effect was good, the fish were very real looking and make it stand out and I jumped and screamed each and every time they tore someone to death or swam by.

However this movie IS NOT for children just because you think they will be able to take the violence their is a lot of nudity, long scenes of toplessness and the traditional spring break wildness one would come to expect from a spring break movie.their is enough shock to keep the movie interesting throughout and the few inconsistencies are easily tolerated for the overall feel of the cheese movies of old.

An underground lake that is disconnected from the food chain and oxygen for 2 million years has suddenly reconnected to the above lake after an earthquake and has a healthy supply of piranha who can eat far more than their own bodyweight in under 2 hours? Seriously? I wanted to smash my head against the first hard surface I could find after this ""explanation"".In one scene, two of the ""actors"" are being pulled by a high-powered speedboat, while hanging on by a water-skiing cord. The boat is moving at over 30 mph while the couple are dragged underwater, having absolutely NO PROBLEM hanging on. In another scene, a twin-engine yacht is unable to move after getting seaweed wrapped around the prop, yet are still able to rev at full throttle and slam the mass of the boat against this magical seaweed.You will enjoy this movie if you IQ is less than 90 or you are under the age of 15.

The movie has scenes of comedic gore. Is it a ""good"" movie? No. Will it entertain you? Yes. Despite the simplistic plot, I still felt quite ""into"" the movie... perhaps that's just the 3D speaking. Many scenes are predictable; I think that's part of the fun Piranha 3D offers.

The characters were garbage, the plot bland and predictable, the humour vulgar and vacuous and the violence nauseating and unnecessary. From reading other reviews, it seems the only people who liked this film are the mindless numnuts who want to see boobs and people eaten alive (often both at the same time in this...dare I call it a film?).

Sure there were a few boobs and BRIEF shots of female frontal nudity, but it wasn't as bad as everyone was making it out to be. Maybe I've seen too much porn or been married too long. Who knows...The gore was amazing. The piranha eating scenes were great as well as the kill scenes such as the girl getting her face ripped off and those two girls getting cut in half...lol classic.

364,karl-812-777487,Grossly Entertaining!!;) Must See In 3D!,10,8 September 2010,"For its genre, this movie is a modern classic! I found this to be one of the most entertaining movies I can remember seeing. It amazes me that some people give this only one star and yet still admit they were both jumping in their seats and laughing. If someone has a problem with gore and nudity then I suggest they not go to see a rated R horror movie that happens during spring break at a lake - go figure.I found this movie to be ground-breaking in its use of 3D technology - what a great idea to use it not only to make monsters scarier (done before) but also to make women more beautiful and lifelike. This movie pays homage to female beauty exquisitely and the young revelry nicely juxtaposes against the mass carnage. Without the people having such hormone driven fun it would make no sense that they would not listen to the authorities and get out of the water. Without it being the greatest party stocked with the hottest people it would not be as tragic that their party and lives come to a tragic end. I do not think this to be a spoiler as what else would you expect to happen but I will put an alert in anyhow XD.I found what I would call the underwater ballet scene to be some of the most beautiful cinematography and choreography I have ever seen in a Hollywood production. It amazes me how this movie can be so beautiful at times, as well as scary, gross, humorous, irritating, suspenseful and even romantic. Piranha does not pretend to be serious but it covers the whole gambit of emotions and well at that. It is about as deep as spilled beer but it is pure, unadulterated, entertainment! - what it was meant to be. If you appreciate female beauty and being scared you will love this film! There is no sex in this film. It is not pornography - other then perhaps emotional pornography XD. If you are uptight about nudity, people having fun and copious amounts blood and want to think about the meaning of life, then do NOT see this film! Go rent Ingmar Bergmans Seventh Seal and leave this party of a movie alone. I can see most straight men giving this film a 10 and most liberated women giving it a 7-8 - either way, it is great but best to see with friends then a date.

366,chrisclark335,There's Something in the Water.,9,21 August 2010,"""Piranha 3D"" (2010) Directed By: Alexandre Aja Starring: Elisabeth Shue, Adam Scott, Jerry O'Connell, Jessica Szohr, Steven R. McQueen, & Kelly Brook MPAA Rating: ""R"" (for sequences of strong bloody horror violence and gore, graphic nudity, sexual content, language and some drug use)I am compelled to begin this review by admitting that I have never seen the Joe Dante-directed ""Piranha"" from 1978. I did everything I could to see it prior to watching this remake...alas, it was all for nothing, as Netflix does not carry it and I just refuse to shell out fifteen bucks to blind-buy a film that has a rather mixed word-of-mouth. You see, ""Piranha"" certainly has its fans and has even developed a distinct cult following, but not even its most ardent defender would claim it to be a cinematic masterpiece. Nor would anyone say the same for ""Piranha 3D,"" a remake that fully-recognizes its dumb-fun appeal and plays up that element to wonderful effects. The key to its full-fledged effectiveness, however, is that, on top of being more fun than just about any of this summer's other bigger-budgeted blockbusters, it is also surprisingly well-made and well-acted. No, it's not going to be up for any awards come next Oscar season...but, you know what, I loved it anyway.Just in time for spring break at Lake Havasu, an underwater earthquake unleashes a pack of prehistoric piranha who immediately begin to pick off unsuspecting swimmers, fishermen, sunbathers, etc. The rest of the plot is completely inconsequential. I mean, I could go on about how the local sheriff, Julie Forester (Elisabeth Shue), must save her teenage son, Jake (Steven R. McQueen), and her two younger children...but, let's face it, this movie is about two things: boobs and blood, both of which Alexandre Aja delivers with a sense of unrestrained glee. The last thirty minutes, in which all hell breaks loose and the piranha make an all-you-can-eat buffet out of hundreds of half-naked college kids, are some of the most insane scenes you will see in modern horror (or, really, horror in general). The results are similar to what would happen if you took the women of ""Girls Gone Wild,"" put them in a blender, and set to puree. In other words, things get nasty.But, director Alexandre Aja, who has made other amazing horror films in the past, also understands that a film cannot rely on excessive gore and gratuitous nudity, alone. We do have to care about our band of lead characters and, though the screenplay wastes little time with character development or subplots, Aja is wise enough to cast a group of extremely likable and talented stars, especially the always-wonderful Elisabeth Shue, the leading-man-in-the-making Adam Scott, and Jerry O'Connell who is shockingly skilled at playing pure sleaze. Kelly Brook also, despite being primarily famous for being beautiful and generally naked (and she is both here, as well), is a very charismatic young woman who, I think, deserves praise for taking what was written as a rather shallow part and turning it into a sympathetic supporting character, there for something more than just getting naked and getting eaten. It was also a welcome surprise to see Richard Dreyfus, kinda-sorta reprising his role from ""Jaws,"" as the opening victim; the humor and gore of his sole scene sets the stage well for the rest of the film, letting you know immediately what kind of film you are about to watch: a gruesome, entertaining movie that simultaneously honors and copies the schlocky creature features that came before it.So, the question is: should you see ""Piranha 3D""? Well, that depends; are you interested in a movie called ""Piranha 3D""? If so, then you will find no better movie about man-eating piranha than this. Alexandre Aja knows how to stage and shoot complete chaos, and he brings a technical proficiency to the film that would normally be unexpected. No one films piranha eating people better than he does and, if you can appreciate that skill, you definitely need to see this. If you hate gore, blush at nudity, or can't take a good joke, then this probably isn't for you. If you're going to see it for the 3D effects alone, then don't bother; the film was converted in post-production and just doesn't look very good. It is not distractingly bad, as some have claimed, nor is it noticeably good, as others have claimed; it's just kind of ""meh."" I, a self-respecting horror fan who has desperately wanted to be blown away by a horror film again, found it to be excellent in just about every way. Had it just been in 2D, I probably would have loved it even more, but as it is, I still highly recommend it to the type of people who will enjoy it. You know who you are.",Piranha 3D

Me myself hitting 30+ absolutely hated this movie and so did my wife hitting 32+. As I looked to my fellow cinema colleagues, of which most of them were in the 16-24 year age range, I saw them laughing and cheering as another boob was shown, or a helpless young woman was torn to pieces by the hungry little bastards. Warning big spoiler coming up! Especially the scene where a torn of penis is eaten by a piranha and then pukes it out towards the viewer was the absolute highlight of the evening for the younger folks. So there you have it.

I am a huge fan of this genre, I've watched just about every man eating water monster movie there is, but this movie was a huge let down. No doubt the director went into this movie thinking he had something to add to this genre, in the end he took all features that worked for the genre and tweaked them just enough to bring them to ruin. For instance, ""the less is more"" aspect of Jaws, wherein you don't see the Shark and blood and gore with each attack actually adds to the film because it leaves room for the imagination, where in this film the gore is so grossly overdone you are desensitized and apathetic. My objection is not due to a weak stomach, but merely it did not work or add to the film. I believe in getting what you pay for, which in this case should have been a movie about Piranha. However, in reality the title for this movie should be ""Man Obsessed with Female Anatomy Has a Camera and Money to Burn."" And while I didn't go into the movie looking for sophistication, I also didn't think they'd let a teenager going through puberty direct this film. At the very least there should have been a warning in the trailer, so that people don't waste their money and time.",Piranha 3D
374,electros01,Lacks of originality and too predictable,1,12 November 2010,"(Sorry my bad English, I will make my best effort) First I am not a fan of gore, even I had not seen even a trailer of this movie. I just watched this movie, my review is short: teenagers having fun, some erotic scenes and then a blood bath. In my opinion the scenes were too predictable: get anxious in a scene, first reaction was a mistake, then immediately comes the scare followed by a strong sound.Merely, without the gore scenes, I think I was watching ""Naked Wild On"", except for the piranhas.Some parts of the movie were just awful, I do not want waste time reviewing them.A few years ago I watched ""Elfen Lied"", a Japanese anime, my first impression was just a nonsense blood bath, however, after viewing the next chapters, the plot was very interesting, nothing like this movie.So, if you are not a fan of gore, or at least want a good plot in this type of movies, do not watch this movie.",Piranha 3D
375,jarradrodgers,Unreal.. Best movie ever.,3,9 January 2011,Are you serious?6 stars out of 10? Was it in the soft porn section at the video shop?Thats about all I enjoyed the girls & the profanity was about the only reason I didn't turn it off halfway through or drown myself in the toilet to avoid the painfulness. I wish there was any sort of suspense but whoever made this movie had no idea about making a horror movie and only wanted to appeal to pubescent teens wanting too check out some boobs. Overall I didn't mind the smoking hot babes getting randy but it could of at least made me laugh or made me feel sorry for the people getting chomped by the dodgy CGI prawns.,Piranha 3D
376,OllyblingFilm,A Total 'Lads' Film,8,16 January 2011,"The film contains everything that an average 18+ want: 1. Gore 2. Sex & Nudity 3. Action 4. 3DThe gore in the film is non-stop and its not done discretely at all. Chucks of flesh, eyes and parts of bodies fly all over the place when piranha's attack. One scene was one of the worse things i have ever seen: A girls hair is caught in a boats propeller and her forehead is completely ripped off. The girls in the film make it feel like spring break in your livingroom, its also quite nice to see the nice 'hot' girls get ripped apart by fish.... there is no actual sex in the film et there is a lot of 'presented' sex. Totally non-stop action, i was never bored for a minute as i either thought about what just happened or i know whats going to happen......purely amazing. The 3D wasn't presented as i thought it would be, there was a lot of depth yet not much in your face action. One or two fish jumped out and so did a wire, but it was quite rare. It did enhance but i was a little disappointed. So the film was fun, gory, smoking hot and had a nice hint of 3D added to it. Definitely a film for men.",Piranha 3D
377,dvsmithk,Piranah Sucks!! Nothing but Stupid whores!,1,18 January 2011,This is the worst movie I have ever seen! I love scary movies not whore movies. Maybe I wanted to watch and enjoy a movie why does everything have naked stupid whores in it. Men would love it if every damn movie had naked men in it right? The women that play these parts are ignorant whores with no morals. I hope they drown!!!! The world is falling apart too bad I have to raise my kids in this piece of *%@# world!!! Do not waste any of your time watching this movie. I can deal with some naked loser sluts but this movie is far out. At first we were going to let our son watch it with us but I didn't know just how stupid it really was. Wow unbelievable. Stupid no good whores I hope they get older and go thru he@@ over this and are truly embarrassed for being so stupid maybe their future children and grandchildren can walk around with bags over their heads in shame of being related to these whores.,Piranha 3D
378,JohnBriscoe74,"Stop expecting Oscar Material, This movie was a blast for those of us who Don't whine about it",10,28 January 2011,"OK, let me start off by saying to those of you who are too moronic and idiotic enough to expect an Oscar worthy movie, you may have your heads up your asses if you expected that, This movie was meant to be enjoyed by those of us here who look for a fun monster flick, and this movie was just that, a good old time and a great way to end the summer. People, you guys that watch that bull like Slumdog Millionaire, BTW, that movie was an ABSOLUTE DISGRACE and an ABOMINATION. But I digress, Piranha 3D was a treat for me, It had exactly what I expected, fun kills, likable characters, the boobs were a plus, I didn't mind it at all. Not sounding like a perv here but hey, if its there then its there. Elisabeth Shue did a cool job as the Sheriff, and Ving Rhames was pretty good, nice to see him in a movie like this. Check out Day and Dawn of The Dead to see more of him in this genre. I would go on with the other characters but its getting late so I'll wrap this up. For those of you like me that enjoyed this movie then awesome, for those who ***** and moan and even were stupid enough to take your kids to it, then thats your own fault",Piranha 3D
379,thorneted,Bomb!,1,3 March 2011,"Forget watching this and don't be drawn to it by the cast, especially with Richard Dreyfuss as he is written out in the first 3 minutes before the credits have even arrived. Ving Rhames is rarely seen, as is Christopher Lloyd. The film wastes the talent of Elisabeth Shue and Jerry O'Connell is a complete embarrassment to men and to himself. The film is complete rubbish and nonsense and the peak of it is when Ving Rhames pointlessly sacrifices his own life whilst standing in the shallows using an outboard motor on the piranhas. It will probably appeal to those who are 6-8 years but then it is rated MA for adults, so there's the dilemma. There's a lot of gaps, and lacks continuity. It seems that the producers were confused whether to make use of special 3D effects, or not then again maybe they exhausted their very small budget for it, in the end the effects looked quite amateurish. Also the producers seem to not know what direction that they wanted to go, as virtually all the attempted gore scenes were easily predicted. No shock value and hardly a comedy as there's very few laughs, it is just poorly produced, directed and the childish unintelligent script focuses far too much on (again) pointless female body flashes.",Piranha 3D

Here is my point, within the first 30 mins of the film, you have a guy being attacked by the PIRANHA!!!!, one min LOADS of blood, "" oh then 1 second later NO BLOOD"", here is a tip guy's, DIRECTOR'S!!!!!!!!! Any human killed in water will cause the water to go BLOOD RED for a long time!!!!!!!! You people can't even get that right, guess I should turn it off and get a refund hey!!!!!! how stupid......",Piranha 3D
381,vishalsh521-113-76160,Would not recommend unless you're looking for some mindless titillation,4,11 January 2012,"The movie has used all the usual formulas of monster movies with lots and I repeat, LOTS of gore. A bunch of kids have been thrown in, stretching their ultimate rescue attempt till the end on the lines of a typical monster flick.On the issue of nudity, I would NOT recommend this movie to parents who intend to take their kids out for a movie in theater. There's plenty of gratuitous nudity throughout the movie and one scene in particular could make even adults (specially men), pretty uncomfortable. The actors appear to be out of their depth and hardly in the mood to act, but barring a few exceptions, mediocre acting does go side-by-side with a monster movie plot.Now the good part - the piranhas appear pretty well designed and the scenes involving the fish being pulled out of water with the victim's body does some credit to the FX team. I watched the 2D movie, so no idea whether the movie appeared better or worse on 3D, but if you want to spend your good dough and time on watching this movie for the sake of entertainment, my advice - Don't!",Piranha 3D
382,Baby_6,"Fun, Ridiculous Gore with Too Much Boob",6,12 February 2013,"This movie is a laugh-out-loud, no holds barred gore fest.Richard Dreyfuss opens the movie with a clever cameo as a fisherman in a little boat oblivious to the horror lurking below him. (Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water...) In fact, there's a whole array of fun cameos held together with the always steady Elisabeth Shue, acting the s**t out of a pretty silly script.But it's supposed to be silly. Piranha features the kind of over the top story and gore that you want to watch with your friends on a raucous Friday night. Any movie that has Jerry O'Connell half eaten by mutant piranhas and screaming, ""They took my penis! THEY TOOK MY PENIS!!"" gets an 'A' in my book.The only thing I found obnoxious was the absolute abundance of ""fan service."" The first half of the movie was mainly closeups of young bikini-clad boobs and butts. In fact, about a fourth of that time there weren't even bikinis. Once scene seemed like a tame porno. Those of us who have boobs and aren't as fascinated with them may find it a bit grating eventually, since the plot seems to take a break at these times. I wouldn't discourage anyone from seeing the film, but I do knock a star off for that.Still, the action, the laughs, competent acting, and good production value all come together to make this over the top film a blast. If you want to have a good time, invite your friends over for a viewing and take shots every time a spring break teen is eviscerated. Or if you really want to get the ball rolling, take a shot every time you see a boob.",Piranha 3D

384,stevehnsn,One of the Best Cult Classic Horror Comedies of the New Millennium,10,6 September 2011,"This could have been another piece of crap hor-com flick, but it wasn't. There are more than enough boobies in this to make it worth any mans' while, and more than enough blood and body parts to satisfy any horror fans. There is a plot, and while it's no Shawshank Redemption, it's no Manos: The Hands of Fate either. There are a couple sub plots aside from the discovery and attack of the piranhas, that clearly define the 'good guys' and 'bad guys'. There are about a dozen A/B list actors, though Jerry O'Connell is the highlight, and Dreyfuss, Rhames, and Lloyd all play enjoyable parts. Not quite sure why Rhames' character makes the decision he makes... I guess he's just one of the heroes.This is a movie I rented at Red Box for $1 that I thought would fill the room with some noise, and to which I would pay only semi-attention while simultaneously working on the computer late on a weeknight. Turns out I didn't get any work done that night because I couldn't take my eyes off the movie. Ended up keeping it for an extra night, watched it two more times. I never did watch the 3D version of this, and I'm not sure 3D would make it any better. But for me, Piranha 3D is a classic along the lines of Road Trip, Half Baked, The Big Lebowski, Shaun of the Dead, Zombieland, and Jaws.",Piranha 3D
385,kevinrtitus,Lmao Wow,1,20 March 2013,"Worst movie I have seen in awhile. While hilariously cliché as intended, it made me want to punch a baby several times in the face. at the me it which Piranhas belong to the subfamily Serrasalminae, which includes closely related omnivorous[3] fish such as pacus.[4] Traditionally, only the four genera Pristobrycon, Pygocentrus, Pygopristis and Serrasalmus are considered to be true piranhas, due to their specialized teeth. However, a recent analysis showed that, if the piranha group is to be monophyletic, it should be restricted to Serrasalmus, Pygocentrus and part of Pristobrycon, or expanded to include these taxa plus Pygopristis, Catoprion, and Pristobrycon striolatus. Pygopristis was found to be more closely related to Catoprion than the other three piranha genera.[4]The total number of piranha species is unknown and contested, and new species continue to be described. Estimates range from fewer than 30 to more than 60.[4] Do not watch this movie ever. Please.",Piranha 3D

Whoever thought of this idea really is a genius - Girls gone wild with a few CGI fish thrown in. A majority of guys going for this movie will recommend it to other guys for that one reason...oh and Kelly Brooke! But that is not even a consolation prize. The fish were added as an after thought. The main emphasis of the movie was spring break and the underwater scene of Kelly B and that other woman. I can't believe I got sucked in by the trailer and the title!!!!!

388,aafirules,Everything it promises to be...and more,7,20 August 2010,"Let's face it - no one going in to watch Piranha 3-D is expecting a stoic masterpiece filled with carefully woven moments. Going by the previews, every single person at the midnight screening had come looking for some key elements - blood, gore, violent deaths, skin, corny humor, and a lake-full of maneating fish. I must say, Piranha 3-D delivered on all these fronts! A lot of 'creature' movies often lose the viewer during the 'lull before the storm' section of the film - this is where Piranha 3-D keeps its male viewers amply occupied with acres of gratuitous nudity. The teen romance bit is a little corny, but hey - after all its just starters for the maneating main course.And what a main course it is! Though the fish seem quite CG and the 3-D definitely seems to be the afterthought that it is, there is about 9-10 mins of absolute mayhem in the middle of the movie which is almost unsurpassed in the violent-deaths-per-minute history of creature flicks. Even if you saw the 9 minute teaser, this is still worth the movie ticket (and combined with Kelly Brook, this ticket is a steal!) All in all, a no-holds barred (and I really mean it - wonder how it got away with an R and not NC-17) fun film. If gore and severed limbs and people make you pukish, make sure you don't stuff yourself before going - you don't want to subject the people in front of you to a very 3-D hurl!",Piranha 3D

I give it a 10 out of a 10 for keeping me entertained throughout the entire film and keeping me interested in all the cast and the surprising amount of guest stars or supporting cast is actually overwhelmingly clever and well thought-out. How they got Richard Dreyfuss to be in the movie I will never know.
