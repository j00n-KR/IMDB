0,TheLittleSongbird,A decent little film,7,21 August 2011,"I watched Hollow Man not expecting much but while it was flawed the film was decent. The story is predictable despite a very interesting theme complete with a rather abrupt ending, the characters are hollow particularly Elisabeth Shue's character and the script is on the weak and cheesy side. However, visually it is fantastic with the photography crisp and the effects spot on and the music from master Jerry Goldsmith is very atmospheric. A lot of scenes are genuinely suspenseful and taut and the action is well choreographed. The acting is mostly good, though I thought Shue tries a little too hard with her shallow character, with Kevin Bacon particularly impressive. All in all, decent. 7/10 Bethany Cox",Hollow Man
1,Leofwine_draca,"Imaginative effects, but this is nothing like a Paul Verhoeven film",5,1 August 2016,"A 21st-century updating of THE INVISIBLE MAN with the added bonus of state-of-the-art special effects? It's a plan which sounds like it can't fail. Unfortunately for us, though, it does fail, and fans of director Paul Verhoeven are in for a big letdown. Eschewing his patented over-the-top gore, seen in the likes of ROBOCOP and STARSHIP TROOPERS, Verhoeven gives us a middling film which is only too happy to rip off most of its plot points from other, better productions.Instead of having his invisible fiend on the loose in an unsuspecting world, the scriptwriter decided to place most of the action inside an underground laboratory. Like we haven't seen that one before. This immediately loses much of the interest which could have been aroused had the plot taken a different, unconventional direction. As it is, HOLLOW MAN soon descends into typical slasher territory, with a group of people trapped in a single location and being stalked by an unstoppable killer.With a plot like this you can guess most of what will happen and very rarely does the film surprise or shock. One interesting angle of the story is to focus on the 'Peeping Tom' style voyeurism of Kevin Bacon's character, as he spies on undressing neighbours and fondles a sleeping woman while invisible. But even the horror of the climatic attack (and apparent rape) of a neighbour is ruined by some slap-dash editing which leaves the outcome to your imagination and makes you think ""what?!"".Elsewhere, the acting fails to impress on all accounts. Elizabeth Shue is a boring heroine with little to impress in the way of charisma or personality. Josh Brolin is instantly forgettable as yet another bespectacled scientist, while none of the other characters are ever developed beyond basics - they're just there to be killed by Bacon. Bacon himself is off screen most of the time, and to be honest his performance is pretty forgettable too. Most unforgivable though, is the total waste of William Devane in a cameo appearance.Where this film does succeed are the special effects, which are, of course, top-notch. Highlights include some startling regenerations and disappearances of a gorilla and Bacon himself, which are the finest ever put to screen and pretty disturbing (due to the fact that the subjects of the experiments are in agony while this happens). The SFX wizards also take full advantage of having the invisible man in a swimming pool, getting burnt, covered in blood etc, to show as much of him as possible, if you see what I mean. Gone are the quaint cigarettes on wires, we now have a partially invisible murderer soaked in blood and killing. Subtle it ain't.The lack of gore is another big disappoint, and there's nothing here that you won't see in a typical slasher-fest. Probably the best bit comes when a nerdy scientist is impaled (from behind) on a metal bar of some sort, but that's about it. All in all it's a hollow experience, but worth watching just to see what the (very) special effects are like.",Hollow Man
2,SnoopyStyle,Could have been soft porn,5,9 November 2013,"Sebastian Caine (Kevin Bacon) is a scientist working on an invisibility serum. He's working with his ex Linda McKay (Elisabeth Shue) and her new secret boyfriend Matthew Kensington (Josh Brolin). Without telling his military backers, he moves forward to human testing with dire consequences.It doesn't surprise me that this was directed by Paul Verhoeven. The first thing the invisible guy does is to grab sleeping lady's boob. There is no surprise or suspense here. The guy turns from peeping tom straight to murder and rape. It's the limit of his vision.The CG is well done for that era. It's well integrated into the real world. That could have made this a great horror movie. It's been a long time since the Invisible man was a relevant character. It's not going to be one on the backs of this movie.",Hollow Man
3,Hitchcoc,You Could See Right Through It,5,13 September 2001,"I'm not going to belabor the points already made. Everyone has pretty much done justice to this movie. If I'm going to go off on something, it will be my biggest peeve about contemporary movie making. That is the use of special effects to the exclusion of any story and the laziness that goes with it. The beginning of this film is so impressive and sets up an incredible premise. Of course, no one has imagination to ask the basic question: If I were suddenly invisible, what would I do? Even if the guy had decided to become a criminal, using what he could do to pillage and fill his life with filthy lucre, there would at least be a motivation for that. Instead we get the newest incarnation of Freddy Krueger or Glen Close in Fatal Attraction, the un-killable, wading through blood and gore, finishing off his friends, one by one. This could have been one romp. It could have been eerie and, yes, really sexy. They didn't even go with that other than to terrorize a poor defenseless woman.I count Kevin Bacon among my favorite actors. He has that kind but complex personality, the bad boy side, the good guy side. But didn't he look at the script, or did they make it up as they went. I think that maybe movie goers who like this kind of stuff, should get in a bus, go to a meat packing plant, and watch them slaughter cattle. Then we could take the millions that are spent on these movies and hire a script writer with a modicum of imagination. Just a modicum.",Hollow Man
4,Prismark10,Memoirs of an invisible man,6,22 October 2014,"Hollow Man in a sense follows the template of The Invisible Man film from Universal made in the 1930s rather closely. In both the person subject to experimentation goes mad.Arrogant Scientist Sebastian Caine (Kevin Bacon) has developed a serum that can make a subject invisible. His team of scientists, which includes ex-girlfriend Dr Linda McKay (Elisabeth Shue) and Dr Matt Kensington (Josh Brolin) get the serum to work on a gorilla and restore it to visibility, although it seems there might be side effects as the Gorilla is now prone to violence.Sebastian then tests the serum on himself but they cannot reverse the process. He also becomes obsessed with Linda who unbeknown to him is involved with Matt. Slowly Sebastian starts to become psychotic.Director Paul Verhoeven expressed disappointment with this film as he felt anyone could had directed. Its true his trademark violence, sex and humour is toned down here. The special effects are very good but the film does descend to silly action melodrama which lets the film down.Bacon not only becomes evil but superhuman as he survives all manners of punishment. I expected more from Verhoeven and he clearly is not firing on all cylinders. Its still an interesting addition to the Invisible Man genre though.",Hollow Man
5,claudio_carvalho,Magnificent Special Effects Even Twenty Years Later,8,28 November 2020,"The arrogant and ambitious scientist Sebastian Caine (Kevin Bacon) is leading an invisibility project for the Pentagon with a six-scientist research team. His closest assistants are his ex-girlfriend Linda McKay (Elisabeth Shue) and Matthew Kensington (Josh Brolin), who is secretly dating Linda. When the scientists revert the invisibility of a female gorilla, Sebastian hides the information from the military committee and tells that he needs more time to develop the formula. Then he volunteers to test the serum and convinces his colleagues to accept to jump the normal procedure. He becomes invisible and plays with his co-workers using his invisibility. But when the serum to return his visibility fails and he almost dies, his mind is affected and his behavior begins to change, turning Sebastian him into a mad man and jeopardizing his colleagues.""Hollow Man"" is an excellent film even when the viewer sees for the second time. There are many films about mad scientists and invisible man, but ""Hollow Man"" has three points that makes it great. The first is certainly the magnificent special effects that are still impressive twenty years later. Second, the direction of Paul Verhoeven, one of the best contemporary directors. Last, but not the least, the outstanding cast led by Kevin Bacon, Elisabeth Shue and Josh Brolin. In addition, is also supported by good story, screenplay, locations and music score. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""O Homem sem Sombra"" (""The Man without a Shadow"")",Hollow Man
6,lee_eisenberg,"if you couldn't predict what was going to happen, then you must be numb",4,20 July 2006,"Another movie in which a test subject goes out of control. We could totally predict what was going to happen. H.G. Wells classic novel ""The Invisible Man"" has been made into far superior versions than ""Hollow Man"". I think that we can all agree that Kevin Bacon, Elisabeth Shue, Josh Brolin and William Devane have all done much better than this, as has director Paul Verhoeven (he went from ""Soldier of Orange"" in his native Netherlands to this in America?!). What a waste of the name of T.S. Eliot's classic poem.All in all, this is a movie worth avoiding. Pretty neat visual effects, though.",Hollow Man
7,jboothmillard,Hollow Man,5,8 September 2005,"This is pretty much a remake of The Invisible Man except not all horrifying, some really good digital effects and a really easy to upset Kevin Bacon. Director Paul Verhoeven (RoboCop, Total Recall) has created a really good idea for a story about an experiment gone wrong. Basically, a bunch of scientists in a secret laboratory have tested a special chemical on animals, and they appear to turn invisible, or hollow. They decide they should test the experiment on a human, and Kevin Bacon does it. Unfortunately, after a little while he discovers he can't become visible again. He obviously gets really really angry and starts to kill people without them knowing, because they can't see him! You think you're alone? Think again! It was nominated the Oscar for Best Visual Effects. Worth watching!",Hollow Man
8,BA_Harrison,"Now you see him, now you don't... now you're dead!",8,29 March 2007,"In Paul Verhoeven's entertaining take on H. G. Well's The Invisible Man, Kevin Bacon plays scientist Sebastian Caine, who inadvisably tests his top-secret 'invisibility' serum on himself, and becomes a deranged homicidal maniac. Caine, a genius with something of a God complex, is a little flaky BEFORE he undergoes the experiment, but, afterwards, with the serum seriously affecting his mind, any semblance of sanity flies right out of the window as he makes the most of his new power by raping and killing at will.There is a big clue to the condition of Sebastian's fragile mental state at the beginning of the movie: as he taps away at his PC, trying to solve a scientific problem, the word 'unstable' appears on the screen, before cutting to a close-up shot of his face. And this, being a typically OTT Verhoeven FX-fest, is about as subtle as the film getswhich is fine by me 'cos I love the Dutch deviant's more flamboyant style: mucho gore, minimal plot, sexy gals and GREAT BIG special effects sequences that blow your socks off. Hollow Man has all of this and much more.From the opening scene, in which a rat in a cage is graphically chomped in half by an unseen creature, it is clear that this one is going to be one hell of a ride. Verhoeven and his effects team pull out all of the stops to astound the audience with scene after scene of show-stopping CGI enhanced visuals and bloody mayhem. Whether it be the amazing 'disppearing/reappearing' FX, the pool-side attack on a surprised William Devane, or the tense finalé in which Caine hunts his scientist colleagues trapped in an underground lab, your gob will be well and truly smacked!Although there are plenty of silly moments which defy logic (in typical horror fashion, the scientists decide to split up to find Caine, who by the end of the movie seems almost superhuman and impervious to harm), the sheer verve and audacity of the film means you'll be having too much fun to care.Ending with a tense and action packed climax, which see the movie's survivors (sexy Elisabeth Shue and stock hunk Josh Brolin) ascending a lift shaft rocked by a huge explosion and chased by the kill-crazy Caine, Hollow Man isn't exactly demanding on the old grey matter, but if what you're after is a fun slice of excessive popcorn cinema, then this one is for you!",Hollow Man
9,Quinoa1984,2/3 of a good movie,6,5 August 2000,"I thought this film was pretty interesting, but then the third act was as disappointing as the cancellation of Seinfeld. The first part, where in which (spoilers maybe) a scientist (Kevin Bacon in a fairly credible role) is creating invisible animals and bringing them back to full form. So, he does it on himself and becomes the invisible man. Some might think there is a relation to the 1933 classic. I thought it had more to do with the fly. Still, the visuals are pretty captivating, which shows the invisible man's view of the world without being seen (sometimes). Some parts are very good, but then director Paul Verhoven must've not trusted his audience, because he turned from a fairly intelligent film, to a invisible man version of Predator, where in the third act he is hunted down while he is berserk. While some of this film is good, the destination is a downer; too much is spent on building up to a pay-off that isn't earned with enough wit that should come out of the material. That being said, it might make for some goofy late night viewing some day.",Hollow Man
10,wes-connors,"Out of Sight, Out of Mind",6,19 November 2008,"Adventurous Kevin Bacon (as Sebastian Caine) heads up an ultra-secret group of scientists, employed by the US Pentagon; they have discovered how to turn animals invisible. The group includes Mr. Bacon's beautiful ex-girlfriend Elisabeth Shue (as Linda McKay), and her handsome new bed partner Josh Brolin (as Matt Kensington). After successfully making a gorilla (""Isabelle"") invisible, and bringing her back to the ""seen"" world, Bacon decides it's time for a human to take the invisibility plunge. He swallows the serum, and becomes an invisible man...""What would you do if you knew you couldn't be seen?"" asks Kim Dickens (as Sarah Kennedy).Good idea. An updated, darker ""Invisible Man"" - with Kevin Bacon as the title character, and fantastic special effects - is ruined by a truly absurd storyline. The side effects of Twinkies are astonishing. And, you won't believe the healing powers of Duct Tape. For what it's worth, the scenes with Greg Grunberg (as Carter Abbey) show the subject of voyeurism handled well. As usual, Bacon is game. Finally, Rhona Mitra is an eyeful, as Bacon's busty neighbor.****** Hollow Man (2000) Paul Verhoeven ~ Kevin Bacon, Elisabeth Shue, Josh Brolin, Kim Dickens",Hollow Man
11,Coventry,The Art of Not Being Seen...,5,22 October 2005,"I've seen this film a couple of times now, but I still can't quite figure out what really to think of it. That's hardly an issue, though, since Paul Verhoeven himself as well seemed undetermined what genre of movie he wanted to make. ""Hollow Man"" starts off as a science-fiction thriller about a group of dedicated researchers working on a secret military weapon for the government that makes people completely invisible. When the leader of the group  Sebastian Caine - then volunteers to be the first human guinea pig to experiment upon, the film suddenly turns into a raw social satire that mocks the typical human greed and the abuse of power. After yet another sudden change in tone, when Sebastian totally loses his grip on reality, ""Hollow Man"" becomes an ordinary horror film with a very violent climax and tons of cruel images. Due to all the sudden changes in ambiance, Verhoeven never really succeeds in bringing tension and involvement in his film, and it doesn't exactly make the story credible, neither. Sebastian's mental breakdown in particular is very unbelievable. Taking advantage of his invisible state to fool around a little is one thing, but brutally murdering his colleagues the next second is slightly too exaggerated. The film has absolutely no moral and Verhoeven  as usual  seems to focus more on the sexually perverted possibilities that invisibility offer. Every sequence eventually leads to voyeurism, rape-fantasies or the sexual triangulation between the head-doctors. Unnecessary to say that the very best aspects about ""Hollow Man"" are the visual effects. Perhaps the best use of special effect ever in a horror film, thus it's a bit of a shame they're wasted on such an inept story. The acting is very satisfying as well. Kevin Bacon is terrifically cast as the ego-maniacal and frustrated scientist and he's seemly having a great time portraying the bastard. Not bad, but unfortunately far from great.",Hollow Man
12,michaelRokeefe,Revenge is serious when your stalker is invisible.,7,3 March 2002,Top notch Sci-Fi. High tech special effects. A scientist(Kevin Bacon) tests an invisibility formula on himself and discovers that his newfound freedom inspires him to act on his evil thoughts and stalk his co-workers. Disappearing and reappearing scenes are in a league of their own. Bacon is terrific playing an insane killer. Elisabeth Shue proves to be more than just eye candy. Handsome Josh Brolin is also outstanding as Bacon's rival. Pretty gruesome thriller. Very graphic violence will please horror fans. Kudos to director Paul Verhoeven.,Hollow Man
13,sunwarrior13,Modern Era The Invisible Man,7,1 November 2011,"Hollow Man is a science fiction thriller film.It stars Elisabeth Shue, Kevin Bacon, and Josh Brolin. The film is about a scientist who renders himself invisible.It was inspired by H. G. Wells' The Invisible Man. It was directed by Paul Verhoeven.In this sci-fi thriller,scientist Sebastian Caine is working with a secret military research team headed by Dr. Kramer, assigned to create new intelligence technology. With the help of his colleagues Linda McKay and Matt Kensington, Sebastian has been developing a serum that makes people invisible. The formula is new and unstable, but after a risky but successful test on an ape, an impatient Sebastian, under pressure from Kramer, decides to try it on himself. It works, but no one counted on the side effects; unable to reverse the serum's effects, an invisible Sebastian goes insane, and begins pursuing Linda and Matt in a fog of homicidal rage. Hollow Man is commendable in its special effects.It was so great that it got an Academy Award nomination for it.But regardless of it,the story of the film is more of a horror film rather than a science fiction.Aside from that,it became a little bit awkward in the sense that people with that become invisible just turns out to be people imbued with evil qualities and unbelievable sexual urges a.k.a monsters without any scientific explanations attached to it.In summary,the Hollow Man just turned out to be a monster that one should be dreaded from and to be killed in the end which qualifies the movie give the viewer scary entertainment.",Hollow Man

15,hitchcockthelegend,It's amazing what you can do... when you don't have to look at yourself in the mirror any more.,7,1 July 2015,"It was the film that convinced director Paul Verhoeven to leave Hollywood and take a break from film making. His reasoning being that any Hollywood director could have made Hollow Man, a big effects led movie that made a lot of cash at the box office. It's this that is the main problem with the picture, it lacks some of the director's bite and satirical savagery, even the souped up sex (natural or deviant) that often comes with his productions. Yet devoid of expectations of a Verhoeven masterpiece, and the crushing realisation that it basically wastes its potential and plays out as a haunted house stalk movie - it's a good enough energetic popcorner.It quickly becomes obvious that we are entering special effects extravaganza, the opening credits are dynamite, sci-fi sexy, then the opening gambit sequence literally grabs us - and a rodent - by the throat. From here on in we are treated to grade ""A"" effects and some genius ways of exposing ""the invisible"" Sebastian Caine (Kevin Bacon) to us and the prey he soon comes to hunt. Unfortunately the whole cast performances are a much of a muchness, and playing a roll call of sci-fi stereotypes. All involved here have done much better work in their sleep, but they put the bums on theatre seats and ultimately this works as one of those movies designed to thrill and awe the senses - but sadly not the brain. 6.5/10",Hollow Man
16,Theo Robertson,Hardly A Great Thriller,5,4 March 2003,"Paul Verhoeven is probably  the best European director working within Hollywood today . ROBOCOP and TOTAL RECALL are rightly considered classic SF blockbusters . BASIC INSTINCT I didn`t like and I believe only made so much money because of the hype due to the sex scenes . STARSHIP TROOPERS was an improvement so I was looking forward to catching HOLLOW MAN but was extremely disappointed with it .The problem with the film is down entirely to Andrew W Marlowe`s script which is incredibly banal . An invisible man traps some scientists in a research lab and decides he`s going to kill them ! Oh I`m scared , I`m so scared I can`t keep my eyes open ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ. That`s probably why I didn`t quite catch Dr Seb`s motivation for wanting to kill his colleagues - I was asleep . And watching the last half of the film I was struck as to how any number of menaces could be trying to kill the heroes . For example if you set this on a space staion and had an alien on board you could have had more or less the same movie with the exact same set pieces  , or have a shape changing alien on an Antartic base , or have some naughty teenagers stuck in a creepy house with a supernatural serial killer . So you see there`s really nothing unique about an invisible man going on a killing spree . This premise might not have been so bad if there was any type of intelligence within the script but I`m afraid there`s none whatsoever , and watch out for some terrible plot holes and cliches .Despite all these faults HOLLOW MAN does have some good points , Kevin Bacon always makes for a fairly entertaining bad guy no matter how bad the film ( SLEEPERS being a good example ) , Verhoeven directs with a skill the script doesn`t deserve and most of all the special effects - As you`d demand from a Verhoeven SF movie - are very special indeed . But none of this stops me from awarding HOLLOW MAN very average marks . 5 out of 10",Hollow Man
17,Hey_Sweden,Good entertainment.,7,7 June 2012,"The story of The Invisible Man is updated for the 21st century in this tale of research scientists who've managed to turn animals invisible and then bring them back, and the arrogant egomaniac in charge, Sebastian Caine (Kevin Bacon). He's ready to start testing the process on people, and offers himself up as the guinea pig. Trouble arises when they can't make him visible again, and he becomes utterly frustrated, then gleeful when he realizes the power he holds. So it's then a very short trip into psycho territory for this genius, who begins to terrorize various unlucky individuals, including his own team. The movie is certainly not without its flaws, as eventually it does turn pretty routine, a high tech, sci-fi slasher with an overblown, Hollywood style climax, characters who start acting rather dumb, and, to top it all off, a villain whose virtual indestructibility makes him akin to a typical horror movie antagonist. Still, it's extremely well made technically, with director Paul Verhoeven in fine form, and does have a substantially nasty edge that may amuse some fans of the genre. Even at an hour and 53 minutes, it is paced fairly well, and gets a lot of mileage from Bacon's fun villainous portrayal. Elisabeth Shue and Josh Brolin also do fairly well as the co-leads trying to keep their romance secret, knowing well how ugly Caine's reaction would be to the truth. The main reason to see this movie are the eye popping special effects, especially as we see characters like Caine and the gorilla go through stages of visibility. Even with its flaws, the movie is undeniably exciting and far from boring. Followed by a direct to DVD sequel six years later. Seven out of 10.",Hollow Man

The story is totally predictable, but pretty well done.  The acting ranges from excellent (Bacon) to good (Brolin, Shue) to OK (the rest of the cast).  As I said before, the special effects are incredible...BUT the story moves slowly and it jerks--it doesn't flow smoothly--and some of the dialogue is terrible.  Also there are two very ugly scenes where Bacon (invisible) sexually assaults two women--these scenes are sick and totally unnecessary.

The team desperately search for an antidote but nothing works, Caine slowly starts to lose his grip on reality as he realises what power he has but is unable to use it being trapped in a laboratory. But then again he's invisible right, he can do anything he wants...Directed by Paul Verhoeven I rather liked Hollow Man. You know it's just after Christmas, I saw this a few hours ago on late night/early morning cable TV & worst of all I feel sick, not because of the film but because of the chocolates & fizzy pop I've had over the past week so I'll keep this one brief. The script by Andrew W. Marlowe has a decent pace about but it does drag a little during the middle & has a good central premise, it takes he basic idea that being invisible will make you insane just like in the original The Invisible Man (1933) film which Hollow Man obviously owes a fair bit. It manages to have a petty successful blend of horror, sci-fi & action & provide good entertainment value for 110 odd minutes. I thought the character's were OK, I thought some of the ideas in the film were good although I think it's generally known that Verhoeven doesn't deal in subtlety, the first thing he has the invisible Caine do is sexually molest one of his team & then when he gets into the outside world he has Caine rape a woman with the justification 'who's going to know' that Caine says to himself. Then of course there's the gore, he shows a rat being torn apart & that's just the opening scene after the credits, to be fair to him the violence is a bit more sparse this time around but still has a quite nasty & sadistic tone about it. Having said that I love horror/gore/exploitation films so Hollow Man delivers for me, it's just that it might not be everyone's cup of tea.Director Verhoeven does a great job, or should that be the special effects boys make him look good. The special effects in Hollow Man really are spectacular & more-or-less flawless, their brilliant & it's as simple & straight forward as that. There's some good horror & action set-pieces here as well even if the climatic fight is a little over-the-top. I love the effect where Kevin Bacon disappears one layer at a time complete with veins, organs & bones on full show or when the reverse happens with the Gorilla. There's a few gory moments including a rat being eaten, someone is impaled on a spike & someone has their head busted open with blood splattering results.With a staggering budget of about $95,000,000 Hollow Man is technically faultless, I can imagine the interviews on the DVD where some special effects boffin says they mapped Bacon's entire body out right down to he last vein which they actually did because you know everyone watching would notice if one of his veins were missing or in the wrong position wouldn't they? The acting was OK, Bacon made for a good mad scientist anti-hero type guy.Hollow Man is one of hose big budget Hollwood extravaganzas where the effects & action take center stage over any sort of meaningful story or character's but to be brutally honest sometimes we all like that in a film, well I know I do. Good solid big budget entertainment with a slightly nastier & darker streak than the usual Hollywood product, definitely worth a watch.",Hollow Man

22,utgard14,"""I'm losing resolution!!!""",5,3 July 2015,"A group of scientists led by arrogant but brilliant Sebastian Caine (Kevin Bacon) make a breakthrough on their research into invisibility. But before proper testing can be done Caine impatiently pushes forward with experimenting on a human and volunteers himself as the guinea pig. The experiment appears to work and Caine becomes an invisible man, savoring his newfound ability and using it in inappropriate ways. But when the procedure to make him visible again fails, Caine's mind starts to experience side effects that make him violent and dangerous.Essentially an updated version of the Invisible Man story. Not surprisingly, since this is directed by Paul Verhoeven, there is a lot of focus on the sexual aspect of a man becoming invisible. Particularly that he uses his new situation to become a super pervert and rapist. Pretty much every woman in the cast is molested or worse. While the movie doesn't condone these actions, it is obvious that this is the part of the story that fascinates Verhoeven the most. It's kind of icky and exploitative. Kevin Bacon gives a particularly sleazy performance as Caine. Elisabeth Shue, Josh Brolin, and Kim Dickens are all fine but none of the characters in this are written as relatable or likable. Rhona Mitra has a bit part as Caine's neighbor and victim. I don't believe she had any lines and appeared to have been cast just for how nice her breasts are.Despite the disturbing elements, it's a watchable movie of its type. The special effects are decent given the time in which this was made when CGI was still often spotty. Honestly the most impressive effects aren't that different from the impressive effects of older Invisible Man movies. The second half is probably better than the first. It's essentially 'slasher 101' with Caine going after his colleagues. Yes, it's predictable, but it's well-done and somewhat exciting.

Starring Elizabeth Shue, Kevin Bacon, Josh Brolin, and William Devane, this violent, trashy, unacknowledged retread of director James Whale's 1933 classic ""The Invisible Man"" offers out-of-sight special effects, buckets of blood & gore, but lacks heart, soul, and substance. This transparent $85 million trip borrows elements from the ""Predator"" movies, all those I-Am-God science fiction sagas where a mad scientist acts as his own guinea pig, and virtually every brainless slasher flick. ""Starship Troopers"" director Paul Verhoeven and ""End of Days"" scenarist Andrew W. Marlowe pose a provocative philosophical question: what would you do if you were invisible? Sadly, the answer isn't as provocative.As Sebastian Coe, Kevin (""Death Sentence"") Bacon plays a scientific genius whose ego undermines him from the outset. Under the supervision of Dr. Howard Kramer (William Devane of ""Space Cowboys""), Cole and fellow scientists Linda McKay (Elisabeth Shue of ""Leaving Las Vegas""), his ex-girlfriend that he left, research assistant and rival lover Matt Kensington (Josh Brolin of ""American Gangster""), and veterinarian Sarah Kennedy (Kim Dickens of ""Mercury Rising""), are testing a serum that can render a man invisible. Initially, their potion succeeds one a primate. They erase a gorilla then restore it, but the ape suffers some dire side effects.Afraid the Pentagon may evict him after they obtain his miraculous results, Cole lies about his progress. Later, outside the Pentagon, McKay and Matt demand an explanation. Sebastian explains he wants to test the chemical on himself, without Dr. Kramer's approval. Inexplicably, Linda and Matt condone his unethical conduct, while Sebastian misleads the other technicians. All goes well as Cole vanishes before their eyes. He had planned to remain invisible for three days, but the serum fails to restore him, and he is trapped in a body that he cannot see and suffers from a kind of cabin fever because Linda and Matt refuse to let him go outside.Frantically, our heroes scramble for a cure. Ten days elapse without a solution. Sebastian turns psychotic and embarks on a gratuitous killing spree. Cutting his colleagues off from the outside world, he traps them in the lab and eliminates them one by one. Imaginatively, they douse him with water, spray him with foam, and soak the floor with blood to expose him. Linda toasts him with a flame thrower, but nothing can halt Sebastian. Anybody that cannot tolerate exaggerated violence with buckets of blood and gore should think twice about watching ""Hollow Man."" Not even the marginal camp factor can compensate. When one of our heroes is gutted with a crowbar, the heroine stops the bleeding ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" style by duck taping shut the hero's wound.The first act of ""Hollow Man"" assails us with eye-popping special effects, particularly the way that the test subjects vanish, reminiscent of those 3-D acetate transparencies in encyclopedias. ""Hollow Man"" demonstrates the true meaning of anti-climax in an actioneer. Deplorably, acts two and three degenerate into a mindless slasher flick with the cast behaving like cretinous victims. The first act pays off, but the last two blow it miserably. Like ""Halloween,"" the seemingly indestructible ""Hollow Man"" villain doesn't just throw in the towel after he's badly burned and clobbered with a crowbar, he comes back for more and more! ""Hollow Man"" emerges as much a sci-fi thriller as it is a soaper with its sexually aroused characters. Kevin Bacon revels in his villainy as much as he did in ""Sleepers"" and ""The River Wild,"" while Elizabeth Shue matches wits with him in a somewhat suspenseful game of cat and mouse. The message here is that you cannot thwart a determined woman if you are invisible.Dutch director Paul Verhoeven maintains headlong momentum throughout these horrendous histrionics, but he cannot salvage Marlowe's predictable, see-through script. ""Hollow Man"" emerges as an even worse movie than ""Showgirls."" The final set-piece in the lab resembles ""Alien"" in that our heroes track the invisible man with a thermal imaging system, but it does them little good. Incredibly, when they should be wearing their thermal imaging glasses, they are not! A major flaw in Marlowe's script is that an adequate explanation is never given for what turns Caine into a psycho. Not even the scantily-clad cast can distract us from the glitches in this far-fetched fantasy. Verhoeven doesn't ante up as much nudity as he did in ""Showgirls,"" but he tries to show off as much of the human body and privates as he can. Caine's strip-teasing apartment neighbor exemplifies an extraneous plot element. She turns on audiences when she undresses in front of open blinds as much as she titillates the horny Caine. Moviegoers that abhor simulated cruelty to animals should beware. Caine brutally kills an invisible dog in one scene because he is going crazy listening to the animal bark.Ultimately, ""Hollow Man"" comes up empty-handed.",Hollow Man
24,Calicodreamin,repetitive,4,14 October 2019,"My first comment is the total lack of information provided on the experiments, they just jump right in and expect the audience to go with it. The first half is fairly repetitive, with the same crash cart medical scenes. Then Kevin bacon gets turned invisible and the repetition begins again with everyone afraid of him creeping on them. The whole movie felt unexplained and very repetitive. The storyline wasn't very clear and didn't flow very well. The characters as a whole weren't well developed, and I didn't enjoy Kevin bacon as a total skeeze with a god complex.",Hollow Man
25,Boba_Fett1138,Nice...,7,21 July 2003,"The movie is nothing more then a nice little movie. I think it's pretty obvious that Paul Verhoeven didn't tried to create a new masterpiece but just a fun little movie instead. Kind of like why Steven Spielberg made ""Catch Me If you Can"".Let me start of by saying that the special effects are superb and something unseen (Haha! you get it ??? unseen, ba-da-boom!) But that's about all that makes this movie worth seeing.Unfortunately the characters stay kind of flat and boring with the exception of the Kevin Bacon character of course. He's the only character you really can identify with. But I think that was kind of Paul Verhoeven's point maybe.The movie is also a bit too short. I think it would have been better if a few more scene's were added. For example more scene's of the invisible Kevin Bacon. That would have been interesting.The story is original and acceptable and yes, it's even scary at some points. Another big plus is the ending, it's a kind of ""just when you thought it was over it wasn't"" ending. But further more the movie isn't a must see or recommendable. Maybe just for the Verhoeven fans. I just don't think it appeals that much to the ""normal"" viewer.The only reason why I rate this movie a 7 instead of an 6 is because the movie still has that special Verhoeven style and feeling in it. Verhoeven isn't afraid to show us how we are, instead of how we imaging to be, like in most Hollywood movies is the case these days.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Hollow Man
26,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Goes from being a decent look at an interesting theme to a predictable B-grade slasher,6,14 March 2004,"This could, and should, have been an interesting look on the idea of invisibility. Unfortunately, somewhere along the line, they ran out of ideas and decided to just kill everyone off and have it end in huge explosions, demonstrating a total lack of creativity. Too bad. It could have been great, were it not for the total lack of good acting, the one-dimensional characters, the corny lines and the general lack of anything worthwhile in the movie at all, other than good special effects. I feel bad for Paul Verhoeven; he used to make great movies; RoboCop, Basic Instinct & Starship Troopers were all way better than this mainstream garbage. The only good thing about this movie is the special effects, and, believe me, they are good. They are just not good enough to distract the viewer from all the negative points about the movie. It's really too bad that they couldn't make a better movie about invisibility; we've never had a truly good movie dealing with the rush of power it would be to be invisible. This movie tries, but it just falls short. All those great special effects, and no good movie to back them up. I'd only recommend this to special effect nerds, people who'll watch a movie regardless of quality just to see good special effects. I can't imagine anyone else actually enjoying this movie. I gave it a 6/10, but only because of the special effects.",Hollow Man
27,view_and_review,Went from intelligent sci-fi to cheap thriller,5,2 January 2021,"What would you do if you had the powers of invisibility? The answers, I'm sure, would be numerous, but I bet that everyone would want to become visible again. Because, whereas having the power to become invisible is cool, remaining invisible is not.In ""Hollow Man"" Sebastian Caine (Kevin Bacon) and his team created a serum to make living creatures invisible. The problem they had was making those same creatures visible again. Sebastian found the key to make it all possible and used it on their 400-pound gorilla Isabel.Sebastian and the two co-scientists, Matt (Josh Brolin) and Linda (Elizabeth Shue), were supposed to report these findings to a Pentagon committee, but in a stroke of narcissism Sebastian kept the new discovery from the committee, and his two cohorts reluctantly went along. Sebastian wanted to be the first human to ""quantum phase shift"" to invisibility and back. Becoming invisible wasn't the problem. Returning to the world of the seen again was a big problem. The longer Sebastian stayed invisible and cooped up in a lab, the further he plunged into madness.There were some major plot holes with this movie that made it less sci-fi and more fantasy. The biggest of which was that the invisibility serum seemed to have given Sebastian super strength, super speed, and super stealth because all of a sudden he could move faster than normal and more silently than normal. Furthermore, he had the strength to lift a 230 pound man off his feet and toss him like a rag doll. Then there was the ending.""Hollow Man"" suffered from the scary movie cliche endings in which the bad guy is nearly impossible to kill. First Sebastian was burned to an absolute crisp. I'm talking third degree burns over 65% of his body. The pain alone should have rendered him immobile. He shook that off like he just took a bite of a hot slice of pizza. Next, Matt crushed him over the head with a crowbar (then makes the classic mistake of throwing the crowbar down as though the bad guy is totally incapacitated). Sebastian recovered from that even stronger. Then he was electrocuted. For that he only needed a brief sleep then he was up and at 'em again. He was finally killed when he fell to his death into a fiery pit in an elevator shaft.""Hollow Man"" had the potential to be better if they hadn't opted for the thriller with the superhuman bad guy.

29,evanston_dad,If Only One Could Make the Movie Invisible,3,14 July 2010,"A movie that asks the question: if you could make yourself invisible, would you be able to resist the urge to look up women's skirts? You can pretty much guess the answer the movie comes up with, or there wouldn't be much of a movie. Some less than spectacular special effects try to camouflage the flimsy storyline and feeble acting of this mostly lame effort. Plus the film has an unusually nasty, misogynist tone that comes out of left field and crosses the line dividing wicked fun from perverse good time.Despite the fact that they're crappy, the film's visual effects managed to eke out an Oscar nomination.

30,AlsExGal,A great sci-fi horror action film,8,24 December 2018,"Some viewers complain ""this is not scary"". Well, no, not in the way that a typical horror film is scary. Instead, this is more of a psychological thriller. If you remember the 1933 Universal film ""The Invisible Man"", you only meet the Invisible man after he has already gone insane. What happened before? This film is more about what could have happened beforehand, although the film only takes the basic idea and sets everything in present day.Sebastian Caine (Kevin Bacon) is a brilliant scientist who, unfortunately, is not independently wealthy. Thus he relies on the military for his funding. He manages to make a gorilla invisible then visible again with serums he has invented with said funding, but then lies to the oversight committee about his progress, although this threatens to shut his project down. He convinces two of his team members -Linda McKay (Elizabeth Shue) and Matt Kensington (Josh Brolin) - to go straight to human testing without telling the oversight committee or informing the other team members that they are going rogue. Sebastian says he will be the human test subject.Now Sebastian is a bit of a creep to begin with . He was formerly involved with McKay, but they broke up and now - unknown to Sebastian - she is seeing Matt. But Sebastian has now become obsessed with McKay once again. So the team makes Sebastian invisible but attempts to make him visible again fail repeatedly. Sebastian goes from at first playing pranks on the team members using his power of invisibility, to growing increasingly agitated, angry, and violent as he is trapped in this invisible state and feels like a lab rat. What makes him lose it completely is when he finds out about Linda and Matt's involvement. Even before he loses it completely, though, he has been taking to the streets and doing some increasingly evil things given that he cannot be seen and therefore be held responsible.The concluding half hour is lots of edge-of-your-seat suspense, is somewhat Die-Hardish, and then parts of it are just plain gross. The film makes good use of special effects, especially when Sebastian is transforming between being visible and invisible. Unlike today's films, though, the special effects are used to accentuate the story, not replace it. I'd highly recommend this one and do not understand the current low rating.",Hollow Man
31,anaconda-40658,Hollow Script.,1,25 August 2015,"Hollow Man (2000): Dir: Paul Verhoeven / Cast: Kevin Bacon, Elisabeth Shue, Josh Brolin, Kim Dickens, Rhona Mitra: Special effects are the only aspect of visibility here because the writers are as invisible as the monster they created. It first assaults viewers with the image of a lab rat being torn to bits by an unseen force. Kevin Bacon plays Sebastian Cain, the genius who came up with this formula. When he tests the formula on himself the plot is reduced to slasher elements with everyone trapped in the laboratory until they die. Director Paul Verhoeven never seems to have fun with the idea of being invisible and the results are opportunities lost. He previously made such embarrassments as Starship Troopers and Showgirls, now he can add this sh*t to the list. Bacon never seems to be there and his name Sebastian Cain is about as obvious a profile as Bozo the Clown. Elisabeth Shue is the standard damsel. Josh Brolin plays her new beau whom Cain wants to kick in the ass because they both desire Shue. Kim Dickens also appears and dies graphically. Rhona Mitra has the misfortune of playing Caine's neighbour whom he spies on and then eventually rapes. Without addressing the invisibility theme it becomes a big hollow graphic mess. An idea for a film such as this is to toss it into a room full of gorillas and turn the light off so to make it invisible. When the lights go on, the film should be improved.

33,Wuchakk,"Entertaining just enough, but ultimately hollow",6,12 September 2014,"I remember really looking forward to ""Hollow Man"" when it came out in 2000 because the idea of becoming invisible is intriguing. I was entertained when I saw it, but also somewhat disappointed; an odd mix. Viewing it again last night I was wondering if I'd have the same impression and the answer is yes.The story revolves around a group of young-ish scientists (who are too edgy and ""hip"" to be believable) working on a serum for the government that can make people invisible. Their secret lab is underground in an industrial sector of Washington DC. They've been experimenting on animals, including a gorilla, with some success, but the group leader, Sebastian (Kevin Bacon), wants to take the next step by prematurely experimenting on himself. Havok ensues.Elisabeth Shue and Josh Brolin play key teammembers, Linda and Matthew. Linda is also Sebastian's ex-girlfriend who's secretly seeing Matthew, which stirs Sebastian's jealousy when he finds out. (But why should he care since he's no longer seeing her?) I don't know if it's the fault of the director or writer, but they go a little overboard in trying to make the protagonists edgy (overkill cussing, etc.) to the point that the characters somewhat lose the viewer's sympathy. Thankfully, it's just a little overboard because most of the rest of the researchers are likable beyond Sebastian. And Linda and Matthew weren't really doing anything wrong by seeing each other since, again, Linda was no longer Sebastian's babe.Even though one member of the team morphs into the villain, he's not without interesting qualities in the first half of the movie. In fact, I can't help but respect his ""we're the originators of this project so we make the rules"" attitude and his consequent refusal to submit to the manipulative authorities over him.While there are some outside sequences (shot in DC and L.A.) the bulk of the film is confined to the underground lab, shot on sets in Culver City. The good thing is that these sets are excellent, as far as underground labs go, but it makes for a one-dimensional viewing.Memorable and amusing parts abound, however, like the excellent F/X of the partially appearing/disappearing gorilla and, later, Sebastian. Also, the amusing way invisible-Sebastian has some fun with a couple of kids in another car. There's also a laugh-out-loud joke about Superman, Wonder Woman and the ""Invisible Man,"" crude though it may be. I also like the double meaning of the title: Sebastian isn't just a hollow man literally, but also due to his ignoble character -- arrogance, lust, etc.While ""Hollow Man"" is a sci-fi/thriller it takes on horror elements and clichés in the final act as the researchers are wiped out one by one. Who will survive? So, while ""Hollow Man"" is worth watching, it's far from great, mainly because it fails to take advantage of the promising material and essentially becomes a one-dimensional boogeyman movie.GRADE: B-",Hollow Man

Kevin Bacon does a very good job as Sebastian Caine, a scientist who injects himself with a new and experimental drug designed to make him invisible, and then deals with the consequences: the antidote doesn't work! We then ""watch"" (to the extent you can watch someone who is invisible) as he descends farther and farther into insanity.The interesting question that follows us throughout the movie (voiced by one of Caine's co-workers in the experiment) is simple and even profound: what would you do if you could do it without any possibility of being caught? If there were absolutely no responsibility for your actions? Reflecting on these questions is a rather humbling experience! How far would any of us go? It's an interesting question about human nature.The supporting performances of Elisabeth Shue as Linda McKay, Caine's former love interest and Josh Brolin as Matthew Kensington, Linda's current love interest (both fellow scientists in the experiment) are all right although not overwhelming.

42,bowmanblue,A great little B-movie pretending to be A-list,7,10 June 2020,"Yes, 'Hollow Man' is basically a retelling of the classic old story 'The Invisible Man,' only for the 2000s. It's been made many times before and since and, although this version only really offers some pretty good special effects (for the time), it's still a lot of fun in a 'B-movie' kind of way.Here we have a kind of 'Flatliners-esque' tale of a bunch of Government-sponsored scientists working on ways to turn living creatures invisible for the military in Washington. Kevin Bacon is the lead scientist and, in true Jeff Goldblum from 'The Fly' style, he decides the best way to test the process would be for him to volunteer.Naturally, things don't go to plan and who could have foreseen that being completely invisible for long periods of time could lead to mental instability (although Kevin Bacon's character was a bit bonkers to begin with!). Therefore, soon the other scientists (mainly Elizabeth Shue and Thanos, aka Josh Brolin) have more to worry about than just figuring out a way to make gorillas visible again.Yes, the special effects have aged, but only slightly. They're still pretty impressive and still hold up in the whole 'B-movie-fun' environment. Paul Verhoven ('Robocop, Total Recall' and 'Starship Troopers' - among others) is the director. And, although I couldn't fault any of the direction on display here, it's not really THAT Paul Verhoven. Besides the nudity (which he seems to feel the need to include in pretty much everything he does) there are no satirical cutaway adverts or anything that makes you think you're watching something done by the same creative man behind 'Robocop' and 'Starship Troopers.'There are good films, bad films and generally just fun films. This is totally the latter. It doesn't really do anything different and there's nothing you probably haven't seen before, but that doesn't make it bad. It's a simple 'popcorn' film that you can just sit back and enjoy. I found it a good watch back in the cinema and twenty years later it's still a lot of fun (even if some of the plot holes are a little more apparent the more you think about them - which is even more reason not to bother looking too deeply into it).",Hollow Man
43,Cineanalyst,Wells Story Hollowed Out,4,4 October 2018,"""The Invisible Man"" (1933) is one of the greatest entries in Universal's classic monster movie canon. Only the first two Frankenstein films are quite as good--all three being made by the same director. Like ""Hollow Man,"" the 1933 film exploited the visual effects of its era for spectacle--in that case, it was the photographic process of traveling mattes; here, it's digital effects and CGI. Both, however, required composite images, of shots with the actors and ones without them, to create the transparency effects. ""The Invisible Man"" was released at a time when synchronized-sound films were still rather new as the dominant mode, having surpassed silent cinema only within the last half decade, and there were still holdouts, including Hollywood's own Charlie Chaplin. In this light, the disembodied voice of Claude Rains that occupies most of the proceedings had a bit of self-referential resonance, of actors' bodily performances--the entire system of expressions and gestures that conveyed characters in silent films vanishing--being replaced by voices. Careers were ruined in the transition to talkies, with new talent from the stage and radio being recruited. Cleverly, the film incorporated the radio--another disembodied voice--as well as the telephone into its updating and cinematic translation of the novella by H.G. Wells. So what does ""Hollow Man"" do to make this notion of invisibility relevant amidst its reveling in the latest special effects? Not much. Instead, we get a generic slasher movie.The book isn't a bad read, short and full of action as it is, but I wasn't especially enthralled with reading it, so I'm surely not opposed to dramatic overhauls of its narrative, to the point that ""Hollow Man"" is merely ""inspired"" by it. The 1933 version, while more faithful to some of the story particulars, is itself a loose adaptation. Both movies invent love triangles. Both allude to the Biblical Cain as the source of the invisible man's insanity. In ""Hollow Man,"" it's also the name of the character, but both also refer to a ""caine"" drug involved in the invisibility process, although the reference is rather quick here: part of the science-y mumbo- jumbo, ""injecting serial protein caine 1, 2, 7,"" is mentioned. I would like to think that the numbers refer to ""Hollow Man"" following in the footsteps of the six Universal films of the 1930s and 1940s to feature the Invisible Man, but I doubt it. (The first sequel to the 1933 film, ""The Invisible Man Returns"" (1940) did cleverly change the drug's name from ""monocaine"" to ""duocaine,"" to reflect its ""duo"" status as a sequel.) In the 1933 film, it's the drug that makes Griffin insane, but in ""Hollow Man,"" the drug of invisibility is more akin to those taken in ""Jekyll and Hyde,"" where Caine's altered appearance, or lack thereof, enables him to act upon his dormant sexual and violent perversities--a point the film makes early on with Cain's peeping Tom antics over the woman stripping in the neighboring building and his continued desire for his ex and fellow scientist.The book was also adroit in constructing its narrative to reflect the invisibility of its protagonist via an ""invisible"" third-person narrator who provides a sidelong glance of the Invisible Man comprised of reports from the visible characters he interacts with. For the most part, the Invisible Man in the 1933 film is also only ""seen"" when interacting with visible characters. Not so in ""Hollow Man,"" however, which begins with a visible Caine and is generally content to adopt the usual omnipresent narrative, with the occasional point-of-view perspectives from various characters and also from camera monitors. God's eyes, in other words; although, within the narrative, it's Caine and the scientist in the room above who make clunky jokes of playing God. And there's the sight-based reliance upon the modern-day horror film staple of jump scares. Somewhat more appropriate are the few supposed-surprise visual twists by the use of off-screen space--usually where a character is startled by an initially unseen presence, which may be assumed to be invisible, but which is then shown not to be.""Hollow Man"" was made on the precipice of the explosion in popularity of motion-capture acting, the norm of almost-entirely CGI-created environments and the rise of digital cinema, with such movies as the ""Star Wars"" prequels, ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, the ""Planet of the Apes"" rebooted series, ""Avatar"" (2009) and the MCU, to name a few. Again, as in the talkie revolution, an entire form of filmmaking and performance seems to be vanishing. And ""Hollow Man"" appears to consider none of this. Instead, it's preoccupied with rendering, through its CGI and digital effects, visible what was formerly unseen. You know, what every other Hollywood spectacle does these days.Of all the wasted opportunities, I may be even more disappointed by the lack of camp in ""Hollow Man,"" considering how much there is in the 1933 film and how much is in other movies by director Paul Verhoeven--e.g. ""Starship Troopers"" (1997), ""Showgirls"" (1995) and ""Basic Instinct"" (1992). But, nope, we merely get horror film clichés instead.",Hollow Man

Instead, with ""Hollow Man"", I found a disaster of a movie. And I say that as a person who loves a good horror movie.The basic idea, of course, is a modernization of the old H.G. Wells story. I'm not sure I like the update. This film is about watching Kevin Bacon...I mean Kevin Bacon's character he a total jerk (I was going to use another term, but this is IMDb). The film is also about Kevin Bacon...I mean Kevin Bacon's character be a pervert. The film is about Kevin Bacon's character being a murderer. To be perfectly honest, I pretty much lost all interest in Kevin Bacon after I first saw this film in the theater.There are 2 good things about this film. The first is excellent special effects. The second is seeing Josh Brolin in a very good supporting actor role.The rest of the acting was marginal. Elisabeth Shue was rather shallow for many parts of the film, although okay later in the film when she has more of an action role. Kim Dickens was ""okay"". Greg Grunberg failed to impress. Joey Slotnick was fairly decent. William Davane was as good as he usually is, although his part was rather small.I know it's science fiction, but in many ways the basic science here is pretty...well...foolish.I will say the conclusion of the film is pretty decent.Overall I don't give this film a G or R rating.

47,tomgillespie2002,An embarrassingly over-the-top shlock-fest that is still quite enjoyable,5,2 September 2012,"The story of the Invisible Man has taken many forms on TV, film and in literature since the publication of H.G. Wells' classic novel. The best known, possibly, is James Whale's fantastic Universal adaptation, starring Claude Rains as the scientist gone mad, and actors from the likes of David McCallum and Chevy Chase have played the title character since then to various degrees of sympathy. It was always a story of the psychological effects a new found power can have on a human being, posing the inevitable question of what would you do if no-one could see you? I wouldn't like to dwell on the things I would find myself getting up to, but director Paul Verhoeven is clear as to what he thinks men would get up to - voyeurism and rape, and this is a key theme throughout Hollow Man, amidst all the extreme gore of course.Arrogant, obnoxious scientist Sebastian Caine (Kevin Bacon) makes a breakthrough in reversing invisibility on a gorilla, but when reporting his success to the Pentagon, he opts to hold back information to gain more time to experiment on himself. Co-workers Linda (Elisabeth Shue), an ex-lover and still the subject of Caine's affections, and Matthew (Josh Brolin), who is secretly dating Linda, voice their objections, but Caine's insistence eventually wins them round, and successfully turns himself invisible. The reverse serum does not work, so Caine is stuck wearing a rubber mask and shades while they work on the solution. But Caine finds that with great power comes endless possibilities, and his behaviour becomes increasingly more erratic and sinister, and begins to sabotage his colleagues efforts to bring him back.Subtlety has never been Paul Verhoeven's strong suit, but where his films are always hugely tacky and pornographically violent, they come with a satirical bite, more often than not at the U.S.'s expense. But where Starship Troopers (1997), for example, was a massive amount of fun as well as being pretty bloody clever (American soldiers dressed like Nazis!), Hollow Man doesn't have the capacity to be anything but a familiar story with a large helping of cheddar and stock characters, and the satire is left outside. It's still enjoyable seeing the various faceless characters receive a grisly butchering, and some impressive CGI (even by today's standards) reveals many inventive ways you can see an invisible man.But it's often embarrassingly over-the-top and the script is woeful even by it's own schlock standards (""don't you die on me!""). Caine's infatuation with the hot woman across the road (played by Rhona Mitra) leads to a nasty rape, and Caine frequently takes liberties with Linda and veterinarian Sarah (Kim Dickens). It's an interesting theme, and no doubt something that a lot of men would take up given the power of invisibility, but Verhoeven's camera seems to almost enjoy the voyeurism, making certain scenes quite uncomfortable. Yet an enjoyably hammy performance from Bacon overshadows the blandness of Shue and Brolin's one-dimensional characters, and helps lifts the film from bad, to average.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",Hollow Man

That's simple and then he starts killing everyone and then covering his invention by destroying every evidence and trace of it. Don't ever think it is to prevent other people from doing the same mistake. He knows there will always be one who will invent the thing again.

50,filipemanuelneto,I expected more from this movie.,3,25 April 2018,"I confess I expected a bit more from this movie. The script was promising, with a good initial premise: an experiment in humans that works well, but ends up failing because of the ego and arrogance of the person used to do all the tests, the same scientist who had coordinated animal experiments previously and who had shown, at that time, few scruples and little concern for the ethical and deontological issues of his profession. Add to that a high dose of misogyny and you will make the main character a potential villain, to whom superhuman power is given: invisibility.The problem with all this is that everything ended up being terribly underdeveloped. Aside from what I said, there is no script or story, all summing up with a hunt for the invisible man. Another problem is that most of the characters are empty and there is a good deal of clichés and predictability throughout the film. The romantic sub-plots outlined in the film are perhaps the worst part, as far as plot is concerned. Paul Verhoeven is a satisfatory director, who missed the opportunity to make a good movie. Kevin Bacon impressed me positively, especially considering that I have never particularly enjoyed the work done by the actor. He was able to become really bad at this character, something the character demanded of him. Elisabeth Shue tried to do a good job, but she did not have the material for it.Visually, the film is good ... it has good cinematography and a good CGI (considering the time when the film was made, of course), good special effects and sound, good action scenes and suspense. The soundtrack, discreet but effective, is a good addition.

The special effects are rather original and simple to understand and for that, the movie innovates in this field (the layers, the empty holed mask,...) The criminal pulse that appears with the invisibility fluid is also original but also proved to be limited: at the end, the movie is about a confrontation between the mad invisible chief and his medical team in their lab. For sure, Verhoeven knows how to offer dynamic and thrills, his cast is experimented but this in between fight impeaches the movie to be a cult movie. Unfortunately, I don't remember at all the other modern treatment with Chevy, Darryl and Carpenter (that's not a good sign) but here, due to the script, it's only a solid but small Verhoerven movie!",Hollow Man
52,BaronBl00d,The Invisible Man Meets the American Psycho,3,2 September 2001,"Whose voyeuristic fantasies was this film helping to express?  I thought I was going to see an updated retelling(not that there is one thing wrong with the original) of James Whale's The Invisible Man only to find that I was watching a film about a man that turns invisible and uses his powers to caress and grope one sleeping woman's breasts, rape another woman just after she got out of the shower, spy on two people making love, lift skirts, and do other adolescent things.  This film was awful.  Now, let me praise some aspects before I get too carried away condemning it.  The special effects are top-notch.  The first fifteen or twenty minutes of the film are eye-grabbing scenes as we see the transformation from invisibility to visibility before our very eyes.  The sets and budget are well-used as far as creating a great scientific lab.  But then the script starts to take over and we get a perverted scientist who supposedly is a genius of such great magnitude care about nothing more than copping a field and and playing peek-a-boo with his sexy neighbor.  I really thought this was such a sophomoric approach to a subject that could have been handled with such greater depth. Kevin Bacon is okay working with this material.  The rest of the cast is okay too.  Elisabeth Shue looks real nice in some low-cut panties and Kim Dickens has a fine pair of breasts, but these do not good acting make.  Nor do they make a good film. I guess what upsets me most is that Hollow Man gave the impression with its huge budget, state of the art technology, use of director Paul Verhoeven, and its endless ad campaign that it was an A picture.  In reality, it is nothing more than an 80's or 90's B picture trapped in an A picture's budget.  And what makes it even worse is that the ending of te film is one of the most ridiculously staged endings I have ever seen in film.  The guy is invisible not superman!  I really like Verhoeven's Starship Troopers, but I must admit that he really did a poor job with this film and must take most of the blame.

53,Anonymous_Maxine,Hollow Man takes an abundance of fantastic special effects and narrative possibilities and reduces it all to an expensive but cheesy horror movie.,5,7 April 2002,"Ever since the original Halloween was released in 1978, there have been countless imitation films that desperately, although primarily unsuccessfully, attempt to feed off of the success of that film by copying its premise of a faceless and unstoppable killer. In the late 90s, there have been a resurgence of these films, such as the Scream movies, which started off good and then went sharply downhill with each additional sequel, Urban Legend, and I Know What You Did Last Summer (as well as, God willing, it's only sequel, I Still Know What You Did Two Summers Ago). Hollow Man is a film that takes a fantastic premise and reduces it to yet another of these cheap imitation slasher films. Sure, the whole invisible man thing has been done before. Done to death, if you include literary examples. But let's face it, the possibility of human invisibility is one of the most fascinating premises that you can possibly tell a story about. The unfortunate thing about Hollow Man was that no one involved with the making of the movie seemed to realize that. What you have here is the development of an invisibility serum (as well as a reversing visibility serum) by a brilliant scientist, who successfully uses it on a gorilla in some of the best special effects scenes to date, and then uses it on himself. Well, of course he uses it on himself, what scientist could possibly resist? And why would any scientist WANT to resist? Well, the reason may be that, evidently, invisibility serum turns even the most intelligent scientists into raving madmen. The absolutely infinite amount of possibilities for an invisible character are completely ignored here in favor of turning him into yet another bland faceless killer. This time, we may know who it is that's trying to kill people, but what we don't know is why he completely ignores the outside world. This is the greatest scientific discovery of mankind, and this bonehead decides to use it to become a peeping tom and to spy on his girlfriend. This vast and hugely unfortunate simplification of the potential for the story of an invisible man is both bitterly disappointing and more than a little insulting. As Roger Ebert mentions in his review of Hollow Man, it seems that director Paul Verhoeven, who directed such great films as RoboCop and Total Recall, seems to think that his audience is so intellectually dim that they prefer a mindless killer to the incredibly imaginative villain (or protagonist) that Dr. Sebastian Caine could have become. Hollow Man is an absolutely fascinating display of brilliant special effects, which seem to map out internal anatomy just as good as any medical textbook, and is also a great deal of fun as the visible characters desperately try to make Dr. Caine visible again, but it is a dismal failure on the story level. The film starts out with a gigantic amount of intelligence, both that required for the development of an invisibility serum and that involved in the brilliant premise of the story, but winds up in the end as nothing more than yet another mindless thriller, completely lacking in thought and intrigue.",Hollow Man

However, the visibility formula happens to not work the way it should, and Caine would delve into madness. So he ends up being one mad invisible killer.

Elisabeth Shue as Bacon's chief assistant and former lover, and Josh Brolin as another assistant and Shue's current lover, also star. Willam Devane appears briefly as the head of the Pentagon Committee funding the project. Unfortunately Shue and Brolin are not too convincing as the heroine and hero respectively. Bacon, on the other hand, is excellent as the ""Hollow Man"". The story is simple. Bacon and his team have been experimenting on animals and feel that now is the time for a human guinea pig. You know who volunteers. They manage to turn him invisible all right but when they try to return him to normal....well you know the rest. The real stars of ""Hollow Man"" are the special effects. The transformation scenes are very well done with the characters appearing like pictures from the pages from college anatomy textbooks.

As for the rest of the movie, it nearly runs like a cheap slasher yet produced with 95 million dollars!Director (Paul Verhoeven) came from Europe to America in the correct time I suppose. The man is a director for commercial movies, and he came when Hollywood old formula for making the traditional movies was in a new phase of development (read: degeneration!), as the exaggeration in sex and violence was the recent profiteering rule, and OH BOY the right man was here to make the movies rock by the new, yet not very old, rock in town!So (Verhoeven) was imported by Hollywood to make brainless flicks without satires, meanings, or anything that makes anybody think. The problem though, for a guy like me who love to think, is that I'll find nothing interesting in his movies. And as a guy who loves to be entertained, I'll find nothing entertaining in his exploitation of sex and violence either. So when it came to a potential story like Hollow Man, that could produce thought-provoking horror / action, I wasn't sad only, I was real mad as well!Look at the idea of that bold inventor who tested his own dangerous invention on himself for the sake of science, greatness, money.. whatever, and became invisible to have megalomania as a supervene symptom, so he thought that he turned into a God; as he sees everybody, and nobody can see him. All of that could have been a tragedy of a talented man, or a good study about a human who loses his humanity because of his own greed, narcissism or technology, or even a story about other criminals who are visible unlike their crimes (the politician for instance), plus the assured horror and action in the same time too...Nevertheless, it turned out to be just another R-rated B-movie moneymaker, with some nudity and unbearable violence!(Verhoeven) is sincere when it comes to making such movies. However, that may annoy me as one guy on earth who feels pity for the beauty of a story that deserved something other than some nudity and unbearable violence!Long story short, Hollywood is Hollow, and it gets worse as time goes by.",Hollow Man
58,dfranzen70,"Transparent plot, vivid action",7,8 January 2001,"Sebastian Caine is a driven, madly obsessed scientist bent on discovering the key to invisibility. He and his crack research team, funded by the military, have succeeded in making a gorilla invisible - but not in making her visible again. Caine, with the personality of a cactus, finally reaches his breakthrough after an all-night session of caffeine and Twinkies. Marshaling his troops, Caine injects the gorilla with a new serum and the animal is brought back to visible light, albeit with a lot of difficulty.
Caine, along with his top lieutenants Linda (Elisabeth Shue) and Matthew (Josh Brolin) in tow, reports to the military committee that has lavished grant after grant on him and his team. Caine shocks his colleagues, however, when he doesn't report the true success of their research. Later he tells them confidentially that he believes if the project funders knew of the team's success, they would take over the project. He asserts that the logical course of action is to move on to Phase 3 of their project - human testing. Naturally, Caine arrogantly volunteers to be the guinea pig, saying that as the project's leader, he should have the honor.
Well, if you paid any attention to the previews of this movie, you can guess there were some complications. For one, the serum injected into the gorilla isn't sufficient to bring Caine back to the land of visibility. The caustic Caine, growing increasingly aggressive, at first waits semi-patiently while his team tries to find a way to bring him back. Ah, but then he gets restless..The key to this film is Caine himself, of course. He's never portrayed as a nice guy, always as a driven, possessed man scientist who will stop at nothing to get what he wants. This means that when he becomes invisible - and turns on his team - the change isn't a Jeckyll-and-Hyde transformation. To me, this is good character development. And Bacon plays him well, playing against his normal persona of good guy (and sometimes of good guy gone wrong, as in his recent Stir of Echoes). You never think to yourself, ""Oh, it's Kevin Bacon. He'll have a change of heart near the end and save the day and get the girl."" Truth is, Bacon usually plays likable guys. This time, though, Caine's not likeable: he's despicable, absorbed in himself, wallowing in a mire of reckless ego. At one point he tells another character he's God. I'm not one for giving away endings, but I will tell you that Caine is true to character throughout the movie.This is a movie with razor-sharp teeth. It's the kind of movie that'll sneak up on you while you're walking down the street, drag you into an alley, and gnaw the nose off your face. It's a tough movie, bitter in its depiction of man versus nature and what man knows may bring out his demise. This is more than a simple remake of The Invisible Man, although it does owe a bit of its origins to the book by H. G. Wells and the 1942 movie of the same name (which starred Claude Rains). As expected, the effects are dazzling - see Caine turn into smoke, fog, water, and so on while invisible, the elements swirling around him like a three-dimensional silhouette. Special effects, when done properly, can be very poetic, and the crew on Hollow Man deserves highest praise. Bacon's supporting cast deserves a little credit as well, but not too much. Oddly enough, Shue is billed ahead of Bacon, even though it's clearly his show all the way. Her role is that of the ex-lover who's on the team because she's such a dedicated scientist and who also happens to be involved with someone else on the team, without Caine's knowledge. She gets to play good girl/heroine in this one, although one suspects her award-winning talents weren't really put to the test here. Brolin, as her love interest, isn't much more than a bland quart of vanilla ice cream - the store-bought kind without the flecks of vanilla bean.",Hollow Man

62,jimbo-53-186511,"The special effects are good, but everything else was bad",2,3 April 2015,"The first very early problem I had with this film is that when it starts you feel as though you've switched it on half way through the film. Sebastian Caine (Kevin Bacon) and his team are developing a type of serum that can transform matter that's invisible to matter that's visible. There's no explanation as to why they're doing this and what the purpose is behind their research. As I mentioned, the narrative is set up in quite a bizarre and fairly inaccessible way, but this is really the least of the problems with this film.This is another film that seems to start with an intelligent and original concept, but gradually wastes this intriguing idea by creating a screenplay that is totally moronic and a whole host of characters that are utterly contemptible.Sebastian was obnoxious and slightly arrogant at the start of the film, but never in an overbearing or particularly nasty way. The most obvious example of this is when he refers to himself as 'God'. This made his nastier persona in the second half very difficult to accept - he basically becomes a certifiable nutter with no real explanation for his psychotic behaviour - yes he's jealous of his ex's partner and yes it's possible that the serum could have played a part in his erratic behaviour, but it's inconclusive making his behaviour hard to tolerate.I expected Sebastian to create mischief whilst he's invisible and at the start he does just play fairly harmless mischievous pranks (such as undoing a woman's top and so). Again however out of the blue, he uses his invisibility for much darker purposes such as Forcing himself on an innocent woman (the only good thing about that scene was seeing Rhona Mitra's fantastic body - wow she's hot). Then later in the film we see Sebastian pick a dog up by its tail and smash its head against the cage door ultimately killing the dog. The scene where Sebastian forces himself on his neighbour is a little more understandable as you get the impression that he's a bit of a 'horndog' who has little respect for women, but his cruel behaviour was still a little too much to take. However, I could find no reason behind him killing the dog other than to shock the audience.What starts out as an intelligent script gets worse and worse as it progresses; we see Sebastian continually escaping with not one member of the team having the foresight to restrain him or tranquilise him.There are a few occasions when there is one team member watching Sebastian and on both occasions the team members fall asleep allowing Sebastian to escape. Why not have 2 people there at all times with one person watching him while the other person sleeps? Utterly stupid.The writers try to crank up the tension in the closing stages, but even these sequence of events were laughable where super human Sebastian is able to survive being set on fire, electrocution, and a metal bar being smacked square across his bonce.The only good thing about this film were the special effects. Kevin Bacon was a good presence for the most part and the likes of Shue and Brolin were also good in support.For me, this was a very hard film to like and not just because it's badly written, but it's also because it's so mean-spirited. What started out as a fairly intelligent film, quickly became reduced to a ridiculous game of hide and seek coupled with a stupid slash em up final act.",Hollow Man

64,NateWatchesCoolMovies,absolute garbage,1,4 December 2016,"Paul Verhoeven's Hollow Man is one of the most scummy, awful, overblown ridiculous turds masquerading as a movie that I've ever had the misfortune to see. It's also entertaining on a level that suffocates you with unpleasantness and knowing stupidity at every turn. Verhoeven has taken what could have been a fascinating and suspenseful premise and turned it into a one note, bottom feeding genre pile of rubbish that is pretty hard to sit through. Scientifically inaccurate (not that that matters in this terrain) relentlessly unpleasant, super awkward and an all round disaster, it's still pretty compelling to witness, like a school bus on fire. It's a wreck to be sure, but there's plenty of glee to be found, if you're feeling masochistic. Kevin Bacon has laid down a path of many asshole characters over the years, but Dr. Sebastian Caine just takes the cake. He's an egotistical, psycho sexual maniac in charge of an underground research lab, working on a brand new cheeseball formula to make the invisible man. He's creepy and possessive with his girlfriend (poor Elizabeth Shue) callous to his lab staff (Josh Brolin included, before his second coming, as well as Kim Dickens) and an all around jerk off. But that's really nothing compared to what happens when the formula works, effectively turning him invisible, with a few nasty side effects. He goes from a nasty dude to an all out monster as he starts to arbitrarily prey and perv out on his co workers in their underground bunker, going full on Lon Chaney with a side of Ted Bundy in a grating performance that is a career sinkhole for Bacon. I read Ebert give golden praise to the special effects in a scene where he teansforms from visible to invisible, but i have no idea what he was smoking that day because they are an abysmal effort. Verhoeven always has a sort of knowing layer of hedonism blanketing his work, but this one takes it to a whole new level. Hey, at least there's a cameo from the always welcome William Devane! The rest is just a vomitorium. There's a sequel floating around out there with Christian Slater, I'm curious but have never have come across a copy.",Hollow Man

I really think anyone could enjoy this movie. The plot revolves around Sebastian (Kevin Bacon) who is one of the scientists on a team of scientists that are working to create an invisibility serum. They test on various animals at first, but then when they are ready for a human to test the serum on, Sebastian insists that he be the test subject. The serum is successful and he becomes completely invisible, and then when they try to reverse it a couple days later, the reversement is unsuccessful. He eventually becomes completely mad with power and goes after his fellow colleagues. Elisabeth Shue plays his former lover and fellow scientist colleague, and josh brolin also works alongside them and is Shue's current lover. They all play their roles well and I think they were all cast correctly, they fit the characters. The plot is executed well and the visuals were good enough at the time to earn the movie an academy award nomination. 8/10 for Hollow Man. Very enjoyable movie overall.",Hollow Man

Frustrated and drunk with power, he turns psychotic in the classic H.G. Wells tradition.This is a gleefully horrible Invisible Man story, delivered with relish by the ever-tasteful Verhoeven and Bacon as the genius-turned-loonytoon-maniac. As with much of Verhoeven's work it has a terrific unrestrained sense of Boy's-Own comic-book adventure (the secret underground lab where the scientists work is just wonderful) combined with the most horrific and depraved visuals (women in their underwear being groped and attacked by an invisible fiend, animals beaten to death, literally gallons of blood and wholesale slaughter in the last two reels). Whilst the story doesn't ring any new twists on an old idea, the CG special effects by Scott E. Anderson are eye-poppingly brilliant as we see veins and arteries, cardiovascular systems, muscles, tissue, bones and flesh all literally appear out of nowhere. In particular, a sequence where the team bring a gorilla back from the invisible state and the scene where Bacon drowns Devane in a swimming pool, are absolutely breathtaking in the detail and artistic invention of the effects. The film also has a great soundtrack by Jerry Goldsmith and classic horror-movie photography by Jost Vacano. The young cast are pretty much overshadowed by the movie's technical pedigree, but both Shue and Dickens are impressively out of their depth. This is a great fun nasty movie.",Hollow Man

70,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,Makes you wonder about invisibility but the rest is tiresome,7,30 July 2012,"Invisibility has always been a neat idea. Some of it has been explored before and it has been used in many fashions. But to have it done in this particular way is another story. Becoming invisible in this world is a scientific reality; not magic. That's what makes this a cool concept. To actually come up with a formula that disguises the human body so that it becomes transparent with any light that is reflected off it is absolutely stunning. And that is what starts off our story here.Kevin Bacon plays Sebastian Caine, a scientist who cracked the code for making any biological organism absolutely transparent to the naked eye. The problem is that he has never tested it on a human body, until now. So to make sure that it actually does work, Caine decides to test it on himself. This is where the really cool stuff joins the screen. To become invisible, Caine is injected with the serum that will make him transparent. When this occurs, soon all of Caine's skin, then muscles, and organs start to appear. It's as if the viewer is brought back to the days where there were charts of the human body hanging in the science classes.Then there's the case of Bacon's character actually being invisible. A lot of is well done because of how delicate it is to balance between what is on screen and what actually isn't. Making a plastic face mold for Caine so the rest of his crew could see him was an incredible stroke. Let's not forget that Bacon has some fun with his character before he really starts to head off the deep end. It is from there that Hollow Man begins to become frustrating.Soon after becoming invisible, Caine's crew members can't seem to figure out a way of making him visible again. Because of this, Caine starts to become restless and aggressive. Once he heads down this path, he doesn't return. Soon, he begins to disobey his co-workers and runs amok in the lab. It's actually quite disappointing to see because something different could have been done to make Sebastian Caine a little more interesting. Some audiences would have found his performance more appreciative if his character started doing good things out of the ordinary for other individuals. I for one would have enjoyed if he took that path; but that isn't the case.Like any Verhoeven film though, the gore is definitely there. By the finale of the film, Caine is one sick puppy. Some of the weapons he uses on his victims and the way he uses them are just downright brutal. Even science fiction soundtrack master Jerry Goldsmith couldn't help this film. He definitely had the sci-fi tones in his music but no real feeling in it. Come on Goldsmith!It's nice to see Paul Verhoeven do amazing things with the power of invisibility. However, the character of Sebastian Caine isn't anything worth watching. Kevin Bacon tries to entertain but the story spirals down into one big mess.",Hollow Man
71,raulfaust,Lucky Baldwin's,8,29 November 2012,"Wow, what a movie. I remember when it used to be on Brazilian's main TV channel, and since I was very young and naive, this movie scared the crap out of me-- only the advertisement of course, I wasn't brave to see the entire movie. From the get go we already know what's going to happen, but we expect him to become mad much sooner than he really does. By the time he got invisible, I thought he would start killing people, but happily it takes a little longer. One thing I have to congratulate is originality in story, they were very creative while writing this. Even thought sometimes the plot seems to be cheesy, actors are professional enough to make it look serious instead of corny. I can affirm nowadays it is NOT scary, but children that saw this back when released might think a little different-- I don't blame them. All in all, this is more a Sci-Fi story than a thriller, but works just as well. Very good movie indeed, give it a chance.",Hollow Man
72,Kamurai25,"""My Overly Obsessed Invisible Ex-Boyfriend""",8,21 July 2020,"Great watch, will watch again, and can definitely recommend.This has a fantastic premise of what happens when humans discover a process to ""invisible-lize"" and ""visible-lize"" organic life forms. For a 2000 movie, this has a high production value and probably state of the art computer effects in 2000, and for most of the movie they hold up, though they do struggle at points. I honestly do think that it's an ""invisibility"" effect, is what helps it hold up.This is a rather tricky premise, it's presented as a scientist turning himself invisible, but it's much closer to a ""Twilight Zone"" episode with a philosophical waxing of a Dr.'s god complex. What would a human do when it has a distinct advantage / power over others. And while that is super interesting, it tracks a little better if you just think of him as ""snapping"", but the movie fights you on this as it very quickly devolves to ""I could do (horrible thing), who's going to stop me."". It parallels with the mad scientist trope of ""We can, but do we ask if we should?"".Kevin Bacon nails the awful, irredeemable mad scientist, and Monica Potter does a wonderful job of playing support to Bacon and a protagonist in her own right. It is refreshingly different that the protagonist is the bad guy, or at least he's fluid, and it's almost two different perspectives blended together to make one story.I'm a big fan ""inescapable terror"" type of thriller, and this is fantastic example of it, and I think other thriller / horror fans will enjoy this where the sci-fi types might not enjoy it as much, even though that's how this one is sort of advertised.With ""The Invisible Man"" soon available, I'm very excited to have watch this, and am looking forward to a newer version of it.",Hollow Man

When I indeed saw the movie at what is now AMC Clifton Commons on opening weekend, I was happy to enjoy this movie, the last good one that Paul Verhoeven made before he went back to smaller movies. It was nominated for best visual effects before losing out to Gladiator, which was also a good movie. The cast is excellent and the effects are good and the music is great.

74,lemon_magic,"For fans of the sci fi and slasher genres, and fans of Kevin Bacon",5,6 November 2005,"""Hollow Man"" has enough strong performances, nice moments, and interesting plot turns to make for an mildly enjoyable film, as long as you don't think too hard about the plot. Visually, it is quite appealing and effective, and the soundtrack (especially the opening themes played over some effective and atmospheric opening credits) does a great job of adding some ""oomph"" to the action of screen. Keven Bacon is his usual on-screen self, and carries the film effectively, which is no small feat when consider that half the time he is either invisible or covered up in latex, which deprives him of most of an actor's most effective tools (his eyes and his mouth).In the scenes where he is covered in bandages, he has to get the character's emotions and presence out with body language and vocal cues, and even this is filtered through SFX. So I give him kudos for a professional, effective job in a difficult environment. So why only a score of 5 out of 10? Having admitted that the film is enjoyable if you don't think too critically about it, I am now going to think critically about it for a minute. Problem number one is Elizabeth Shue. Don't get me wrong, I think she is a very attractive woman, and she can hold her own as an actress in most movies. But she is horribly miscast here as a ""top level research scientist"" (just as she was in ""The Saint""). She may come across as more than a typical ""dumb blonde"", but she's a clothes-horse, pure and simple, and I can't believe for a moment that she could get a PhD in the physical sciences. She's far more believable fending off Bacon's advances than she is playing ""Pentagon Barbie"". (The other two supporting actresses, who are by no means ugly or haggard, but still have considerably less ""Vogue"" cover potential, are quite believable in their roles). Problem number two is a certain weakness in the script regarding how and why Bacon's character goes around the bend. The movie implies and foreshadows all kinds of reasons: Bacon is already a creep with a God-complex; the serum which turns him invisible is affecting his brain's neurochemistry; being invisible confers addictive power and opportunity he doesn't want to give up; invisibility creates an alienation and isolation from society...etc. But the script doesn't really drive any of these points home, and just flits from idea to idea without doing real justice to any of them. A line of dialog or two is meant to imply a whole series of attitudes and moral values changing, (""It's easier to sin when you don't have to look at yourself in the mirror"", etc.), and even a pro like Bacon can't manage it in the space he is given. Problem number three is (are) the escalating misogyny and graphic completeness of the voyeurism, molestation, and finally rape scenes included in the movie to convince the viewer that the Hollow Man is becoming a human monster. The first two scenes were bad enough (especially the CGI of a sleeping woman's bare breast being fondled), but perhaps necessary, but the final full blown rape scene was way too mean and misogynistic for my sensibilities. That scene didn't need to be there, and its inclusion makes it hard for me to recommend it to my more conservative friends...they would be angry at me if they watched this on my say-so and came upon these scenes unprepared, and they wouldn't buy or rent this movie if they knew these scenes were in it. Problem number four is that the movie producers overreached themselves a bit with the invisible SFX...some of them, especially the transformation scenes, don't quite work. The figure struggling on the table is very plastic and inorganic-looking and doesn't convince. (Ironically, the first transformation scene, with the gorilla, works much better, possibly because our human eyes aren't as familiar with the textures and shapes of the simian physique). And here and there the articulation of the shoulders isn't quite right, or the swing of the hips. These deficiencies seem to be a common problem for 3D computer graphics of the human form, and they dog the animators here. Sometimes the animators get it, but sometimes they don't. I know it wasn't easy, but if they couldn't pull it off, they shouldn't have used it. The last major problem was that the movie should have ended when Shue does her wonderful ""base-stealing"" slide into the elevator and hoses Bacon's character down with her home made flame thrower. That was a great moment, and should have been the climactic payoff for the film. Instead the movie staggered on for another 10-15 minutes in ""Friday the 13th"" territory with the Hollow Man popping back up from what should be mortal injuries again and again - who knew that naked invisible men could be so resilient? So that's why only 5 out of 10. Too many problems and weakness to score this as a classic. But I do own this movie (bought it used) on VHS, and will buy it (used) on DVD if I find it cheap enough. Enjoy the eye candy and strong supporting performances and the many nice little touches here and there...if you are into that sort of thing.",Hollow Man
75,PredragReviews,"You Think You're Alone, Think Again...",6,9 May 2016,"""Hollow Man"" displays all the standard symptoms of advanced Verhoeven Syndrome: shallow plot, no character development, gratuitous violence, and a contempt for the laws of science that almost amounts to an organized campaign to subvert SF as a genre. Witness the dramatic idea (stolen directly from H.G. Wells, of course) of making animals and human beings completely invisible, without the slightest shred of scientific explanation except for some mumbo-jumbo about quantum shifts. Making organisms vanish is done by injecting them with a lurid orange liquid injected from an immense hypodermic that looks like a Fisher-Price toy (but only after it's been ""irradiated""). Making the creatures visible again calls for the identical process - but this time with a bright blue liquid! (I'm not making this up, honest, although I might have got the colors transposed).The film has its moments of interest and truly amazing special effects--some of the best I've ever seen in a motion picture, in fact. If ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" was an opening for live action/animation and ""Terminator 2"" was the breakthrough motion picture for pure special effects, this is the next level. It starts with an intriguing premise, just as ""RoboCop"" and ""Total Recall"" did, only those two films kept elevating the action, suspense, plot, and emotional attachment, something that ""Hollow Man"" is lacking. The main problem with this film was putting all the weight on one character, Sebastian Caine (as misplayed by Kevin Bacon). When the main character is a mad scientist, who's obviously already nuts to begin with, where can you go from there? Bacon makes the transition with no perceptible difference. (Amusingly enough, Bacon was chosen over Guy Pearce and Edward Norton for this role because he has the ""ability to be both charming and diabolical."" Neither of which are in evidence in this movie.) As for the rest of the designer docs who make up the cast, none of them struck me as being even remotely scientific. When they finally started the invisibility process on Bacon, I found that I was never happier to see an actor disappear. Pity his character proved so resilient in the end.Overall rating: 6 out of 10.",Hollow Man
76,vengeance20,Great Slasher!,9,31 August 2020,"Heard of this film a few times before finally getting to watch it. Hearing it was a horror with slasher elements in, as well as the scary visuals are what sold me on this.The film is about a group of scientists who are developing a serum for the army which can make a human being completely invisible. Sebastian Caine who is arrogant & power hungry insists on human testing on the serum after it proving successful on the animals. However, the scientists have trouble returning him back to visibility & it's not before Sebastian begins to turn menacing & abuses the power of invisibility.I found the film to be pretty good! The concept is unique & reminded me of films such as The Invisible Man (1933) & it's PC, Far Left, Me Too Agenda Remake released 20 years after this film. This one was ace! The effects are impressive for a film of it's time even though it is only 20 years old, even back in 1999/2000 this was & is good & before CGI & computer effects advanced throughout the 00's, 10's & 20's.There's not much negativity I can say about this film however, maybe it could've been more beefed up in areas.

Perhaps something about the special effects, which aren't bad at all. They really have put some effort in creating some nice effects (e.g. the water on his face when he's washing himself while being invisible). But I'm afraid that is about it for the positive things.This movie is so shallow and predictable, the acting is just awful and the script never should have been written. It should have been called ""Hollow Movie"" or ""Hollow Script"" in stead of ""Hollow Man"". To give you an example: The main character immediately uses his invisibility to stalk people, to rape and murder them. He could have done some fun stuff with it first, but that probably never came up in the minds of the people who created this movie. It could have made this movie at least somewhat entertaining. Another weak point is the acting in this movie. It just gets more and more ridiculous by the minute.

Great for some solid thrills and scares.",7,9 September 2016,"The blatant amount of backlash and dismissal that has been thrown against 2000's ""Hollow Man"" is something that even to this day- 16 years later- I've never quite been able to fully understand. Is it a particularly complex film? No, not really. But then again, it doesn't seem like it wants to be a complex film... it definitely seems to be focused on just being a mildly creepy and very entertaining roller-coaster ride. And guess what? Thanks to some great performances and very solid visual direction courtesy mad cinematic mastermind Paul Verhoeven, it definitely excels at being mildly creepy and very entertaining!Kevin Bacon portrays brilliant but somewhat troubled scientist Sebastian Caine, who is working with his team (including ex- girlfriend Linda McKay as played by Elizabeth Shue and her new lover Matt, portrayed by Josh Brolin) to achieve perfect invisibility in humans. After successful attempts at making animals invisible and then visible once again with experimental formulas, Sebastian convinces the team to make him the next test-subject. It goes off perfectly- until he discovers the visibility formula doesn't seem to work on people. Now stuck invisible, Sebastian slowly begins to lose his already-shaky mind thanks to the immense power that invisibility affords him... And soon, he may very well begin to threaten the lives of his own team and those he knows as he becomes increasingly obsessed with escaping...The thing I really enjoyed about this film is that it's completely and utterly unapologetic about its intentions, tone and style. It knows what it is and it seems to take much joy in exploiting that. And what is it? Essentially, it's an 80's-era slasher movie with a $100 million budget, A-list actors and cutting-edge effects! (Well, cutting edge at the time at least...)Yes, it's sort-of a shallow concept, but it's just so darned fun seeing the old tropes and clichés of a silent killer stalking his victims with an actual budget to allow for intensely brutal kills, mind-warping visual effects, top-notch set design and wickedly stylish direction. All while characters are gleefully portrayed by the same sort-of actors who could just as easily be starring in Oscar-caliber films in the next screening room over at the theater. Particularly Bacon, who ratchets up both the charm and the sadism in a twisted and wild performance that reminds us of just why we love him so much as an actor.And even though he has more-or-less disowned the film, it most certainly is a Paul Verhoeven picture. It features a lot of his trademarks, like wickedly over-the-top brutality and a touch of his savage sense of dark humor, somewhat subdued though it may be as he was aiming for a more commercial release. I really think he was the perfect fit for the material and he injects a lot of fun into the proceedings, so it's kind of a shame that he considers it one of his lesser efforts. His sense of composition and off-kilter style mixes well with the storyline. If anything, I'd say it would have benefited a bit more if he had cranked up the crazy ""Verhoeven-ness"" that made his other American flicks (like ""RoboCop"" and ""Total Recall"") so memorable. But still, wonderful direction.Add to that some decent cinematography, a wonderfully eerie and evocative score from musical genius Jerry Goldsmith, and wild invisible-man CGI effects unlike anything we had seen at the time, and you just have the formula for an entertaining little film.That being said, I do have to dock some points for the predictable nature of the story. While the unadulterated fun of it being an old-fashioned slasher-flick with a big-budget does earn it some good-will points, it does rob much of the suspense since you can tell what's coming much of the time. It could have been a bit better if they had subverted at least some of the clichés, but I can't hold that against it too much. It's still a great bit of good, old dumb- fun and is a nice relic of the early 2000's- a time when a high concept and interesting new visual effects was more than enough to get an audience excited for a film. Sometimes I miss those days, especially as audiences nowadays seem kind-of jaded about a lot of things. It's fun revisiting a nostalgic little treat like this from time to time.""Hollow Man"" is occasionally scary but always boasts great entertainment value, despite some minor issues with the storytelling. And so, I give it a very solid and pretty-good 7 out of 10.",Hollow Man

Kevin Bacon has a tendency to show off his tight body and I suspect that he is an exhibitionist. That being said, his character is sadistic, voyeuristic, and likes to kill animals and people. Like all typical ""invisible man"" movies, his inability to reverse the procedure and return to normal drives him insane. The only saving grace of this film is the spellbinding final half hour where he relentlessly pursues his former girlfriend and others in a runaway elevator. It will remind you of the first Terminator film (also by Verhoven). I found this film, in general, to be greatly unenjoyable in spite of the great special effects. Tons of blood. A slasher movie.

Luckily, I had read the reviews and some comments on this site before settling down to watch ""Hollow Man"", so I was able to opt for the first scenario...  Bacon can be a terrific actor, and he shows it here despite not being onscreen an awful lot.  He manages to wring every drop of evilness from his character, by and large using only his voice to do so.  That shows talent.   Everybody else is pretty much left on the sidelines.  The effects are fantastic, and if the premise appeals to you from the get-go then you'll probably have a blast.  The endless repetition of characters being killed off in the final third does start to wear a bit thin, but keep in mind that this is Hollywood moviemaking done strictly by formula, and it all begins to make sense.  No, there probably isn't the need for all that nudity; but hey, this is Verhoeven, and I have to be honest and state that that was probably one of the reasons why I rented it!  I watched on a slow Sunday night, with the curtains drawn, lights dimmed and a large bag of sweets.  This, I would suggest, is the best way to approach ""Hollow Man"".  Watch it in the cold light of day and you may begin to notice more how badly it insults your intelligence.  Even I noticed it at the time, the difference was, I just didn't care.  (It also might be a perfect candidate for post-pub viewing)   Warning!: You may be offended if you know the story of Gyges ring, and/or are a Philosophy student.  This topic even made it into one of my lectures, where the lecturer lambasted the film on the basis of the trailer for taking liberties with such high-minded source material!  I guess it just goes to show that he can't be on the same wavelength as the majority of his students, since I'm sure at least 65% of us would find some enjoyment in this.",Hollow Man
83,KUAlum26,"Not for the squeamish,which kinda sums up Veerhoeven films in general",7,22 March 2006,"Director Paul Veerhoeven,who had made a climbing(RoboCop,Total Recall--my personal favorite),climaxing(Basic Instinct,no pun intended here!) and reclining/receding denouement phase(Showgirls) of showbiz success over a period of about ten years,returned to his sci-fi roots in 1997's Starship Troopers,which was passable enough if for no other reason than the fact that it was little more than a standard,sci-fi action blow-'em-up. Here in Hollow Man,he seems to be inching back to his naughtier instincts.Dr.Sebastian Caine(Kevin Bacon,NEVER in need of work it seems),is a hyper-kinetic,biochemical genius and he knows it! He,with a team of scientists of varying fields,co-headed by his ex-wife Linda(!!),are under the thumb of the Department of Defense to create a serum that will alter living DNA to render it invisible(!). Armed with modest success and plenty of confidence,Caine,when hitting a wall in terms of DOD support and funding,decides to take the somewhat ethically challenging and dangerous move of trying the serum on himself. As per the movie's plot existence,the serum works,and Dr.Caine slowly devolves from merely an arrogant genius to a sociopath who discovers new and progressively more frightening ways to use his newfound cloak. HIs chief doubters are also some of his closest peers:namely ex-wife Linda(Elisabeth Shue, as cute here as she is pragmatic and serious) and the co-director of the project Matt(Josh Brolin,handsome and wearing almost three different expressions through the ENTIRE movie),who also happens to be having a relationship with Linda to Dr.Caine's not-knowing(!!!). As the project becomes more uncontrollable,as per the test subject,the project becomes almost interminably doomed.A supporting cast of likable talent--Kim Dickens,Joey Slotnik,Mary Randle and William Devane among them--fills out characters who are basically treated as after-thoughts here. The real star of the film(besides Mr.Bacon's constrained scenery-chewing)is--big surprise!--the special effects and they don't disappoint. The vascular models of human and primate bodies is spectacular,and the visual effects of invisibility is done with what I have to presume(since I haven't seen ""The Invisible Man"" yet,ditto for many ""Invisible"" person films,either) was an effective blend of self-conscious green-screen acting and dimensional camera focus. As for the gore and gut-and-teeth-clenching violence,well,that pretty much IS a Veerhoeven film's traits. This film is no exception at all,and the attacks in the movie are a veritable blend of ways that can unsettle. Let's put it this way:the way Dr.Caine stalks his comely across-the-street neighbor(Rhona Mitra,billed though she had really no lines at all) might be the least VISUALLY disturbing element of the film,but it will probably highly disturb no less than half of the viewing audience.I cannot say this is the best film that anyone involved has ever done,but having said that,this film will probably be a bit of a caffeine boost to those who enjoy their thrillers to be as up-front and testosteronal as can be. I am vaguely appreciative of the kind of things Veerhoeven brings to the table in these films(I WAS mostly repulsed with the whole make-up of Basic Instinct,but I blame that more for Joe Eszterhaus'odious script than Mr.V's direction)and I cautiously recommend this film,hence my summary line.",Hollow Man
84,pyrocitor,"Hollow Man, Hollow Movie",5,15 October 2006,"When ""Hollow Man"" was released in 2000, it seemed like a decent enough premise for a thriller - a modern, updated spin on H.G. Wells' timeless Invisible Man story, with contemporary calibre special effects and the very underrated Kevin Bacon starring as the arrogant and obsessive scientist - at first glance, the film seemed destined to be a hit. Sadly enough, the film falls somewhat short of its anticipated mark, primarily due to some poor directorial choices and a rather sub par script. Director Paul Verhoeven, who in the late 80s to early 90s seemed to be on a roll with hit after hit of action movies (RoboCop, Total Recall, Basic Instinct) seems to have lost his touch of late, preceding Hollow Man with flop Starship Troopers. In Hollow Man, Verhoeven seems to be welcoming back the chance to wield a large budget, and has a great time constructing elaborate laboratory sets and peppering the film with endless CGI shots. However, Verhoeven is inhibited by the very lacklustre script, and it is in the dialogue scenes that the film really drags. During the action sequences Verhoeven is able to pick up the pace somewhat and create some genuine tension and suspense, though criticism must also be given for his apparent penchant for laughably gratuitous nudity, and his casting of a troupe of ridiculously young and beautiful actors as ""research scientists"". The film does touch on some more profound ideas, such as more thoughtful aspects of the invisibility procedure being explored. (Bacon's scientist is unable to sleep due to his eyelids being transparent and therefore unable to close) There is also a poignant theme of ethics when unable to be detected, and as such the most powerful scene in the movie is Bacon's scientist eyeing his gorgeous neighbour undressing through the window, at first dissuading himself on acting rashly, but then correcting himself with ""who's going to know?"". This concept is intriguing, and one can't help wishing Verhoeven had developed such lines of thought further, instead of turning the story into less of a gratuitous action movie, slapping on the gore and sex as is customary for him, and adding a bit more of a profound, thought provoking dramatic touch, a-la Total Recall. Once again, the commercial approach gets in the way of creating a more meaty and satisfying film. Kevin Bacon is indeed the star of the show here, both convincing at the start as an obsessive and arrogant scientist, and while tumbling into insanity as the film progresses. In the end, Bacon is the only one who really comes away with a satisfying performance, even if he does toe the line of campy perhaps a bit too frequently. Elisabeth Shue is disappointingly bland as the female lead, and Josh Brolin, painfully devoid of character as her co-worker/secret lover has such a soap opera vibe about him, one can't help but laugh as he attempts genuine dramatic acting. In fact, nearly all the cast seem to have been cast mainly for their looks, and turn out horrifyingly boring supporting performances, with the exception of Joey Slotnick who raises the occasional laugh as the ""comic relief"" scientist. All in all, Hollow Man comes across as disappointingly hollow itself, with more interesting dramatic themes bypassed for typical explosions, copious amounts of blood and sex. It may be an entertaining enough outing for those looking for a plot with lots of explosions and bits of profundity or fans of Kevin Bacon, but those seeking out a more serious film might want to leave this one in the same state as its protagonist - unseen. -5/10",Hollow Man
85,Maciste_Brother,More like HOWLER MAN,3,26 April 2005,"Leave it to Paul ""sex on the brain"" Verhoeven to come up with a pointlessly sleazy and juvenile version of the INVISIBLE MAN story. If he'd direct a Pokemon film, I'm sure he'd turn it into some massive orgy of sorts. I don't mind sex or even sleaze (check my other reviews) on film but frankly, it's obvious the director has a one track mind and he couldn't see interesting aspects about an invisible man storyline than the kinky implications it comes with it. It's a shame because it could have been good if the film didn't spend so much time having an invisible Kevin Bacon grope women. The game cast of actors does what it can with the one-note cheesy script but I felt bad for some of them, including William Devane, who is totally wasted here.But then what could I have expected from the director of SHOWGIRLS, which, btw, is much more entertaining than this stilted & bad film.",Hollow Man

87,mstomaso,Not one of Verhoven's better efforts. Almost unwatchable,3,30 January 2006,"For me, Paul Verhoven is a very hit or miss director. I generally like his sci fi, and can't stand anything else he does. This film is an exception to the former. None of the characters in this film are likable, and only Bacon and, vaguely, Shue, have separable personalities. The film is also riddled with inconsistencies and continuity errors which are actually laughable when contrasted with the obviously huge special effects budget.Kevin Bacon plays a megalomaniacal egotistical scientist who has developed a method of phase shifting a living creature so that the subject becomes invisible. When it becomes necessary to test his formula on a human, he decides to do it on himself. And it turns out to be irreversible. What could have been a harrowing emotional journey once this discovery is made, actually becomes a juvenile exercise in perverse sadistic horror-fantasy.The rest of the characters are mostly his research team. Shue plays his former lover and a member of the team. Bacon's character is despicable and I never developed the least sympathy for him. However, I should also mention that I never grew to like ANY of the main characters, and that I found most of their behavior absurdly improbable. Despite her talent, even Shue seemed lost in this script, and never seemed to develop a complete interpretation of her character.Sex plays such an important role in this film that I was forced to wonder about the age of the screen-writer - among whose better credits are both Fast and Furious films. The ""science"" in this film is nonexistent, and no coherent attempt to explain what is going on in the lab is made. We are simply asked to believe that 'phase shifting' is somehow linked to the injection of an apparently mutagenic substance, and that the problem isn't getting there, but returning.If there is one reason to see Hollow Man, it is the special effects. The invisibility scenes are very clever and to an extent, startling. But if you want a similar effects experience actually couched in a very watchable and very enjoyable, intelligent, and well acted film, check out the older ""The Abyss"" instead.",Hollow Man
88,mentalcritic,"Severely underrated, but would have been better with Ed Neumeier writing the script",8,24 August 2000,"I think the most obvious reason why American critics in particular have slammed this film is because it shows a side to their society that they would rather not admit to the existence of. You see, a vast number of Americans believe that the bible is a moral code, when in reality it is only a document stating ""do this and that or some big scary omniscent monster will get you"". Hollow Man is an excellent exploration of what happens to a man with subjective morals when such pseudo-moral restraints, in this case the fear of being caught, are removed. In effect, Sebastian IS the god of the bible, figuratively speaking, simply because he has no need to answer for his actions.However, Paul Verhoeven works best with a good screenwriter, as Robocop and Total Recall have proven. Andrew Marlowe is only a good screenwriter at the best of times, and it is a credit to Verhoeven that the first 100 minutes of the film is as good as it is. In the last twenty minutes, however, Marlowe lapses too far into trying to please the Christian American audience, and also loses any idea of how to effectively wrap up the story. If he had simply written one special climax with a sense of irony, Hollow Man would be a perfect 10 in my view. However, the lapse into Air Force One mode means I have to downgrade my rating to a respectable 8. Six points for the first 100 minutes of the story, with two added on for the special effects, which are the best I have seen in years when you talk about integration with the story, as well Verhoeven's fearless direction. This film takes all the previous Invisible Man films and uses them as toilet paper. Don't let the scorn of those who are not capable of understanding what the film was really about put you off.",Hollow Man

90,Victor Field,The Movie That Wasn't There.,5,15 April 2002,"Early in the proceedings of ""Hollow Man,"" Kim Dickens's character says ""This is bulls--t!"" I wouldn't go THAT far, but the movie does fail to realise most of its potential.The script by Andrew W. Marlowe (""Air Force One,"" ""End of Days"") flirts with scientist Kevin Bacon's personality quirks blending with frustration at his invisible state to twist his mind more and more, but what could have been an interesting study of a man flipping out or at best coming to terms with his invisibility (a la the not great but underrated Chevy Chase vehicle ""Memoirs of an Invisible Man"") settles down to being a big-budget B-movie with unfulfilled pretensions and an undercurrent of vileness, though admittedly not quite to the extent of ""Basic Instinct"" (which killed off the movie's only likeable character) and ""Starship Troopers"" (which wasn't nearly as clever as it thought it was).Paul Verhoeven's eye for the visceral is as strong as ever, he still has a gift for eerieness, and the movie benefits from having proper actors in the leads (Elisabeth Shue and Kevin Bacon as opposed to, say, Casper Van Dien and Denise Richards), from special effects that unaccountably lost to ""Gladiator"" at the Oscars (just compare Mill Film's pixillated Rome to the invisibilty work here. Sony Pictures Imageworks and the Tippett Studio were robbed), and from a splendid Jerry Goldsmith score... all of which make you wish that they were part of a better movie. Like one that didn't throw up so many credibility roadblocks (how come invisibility goes from the outside in if visibility goes vice versa? Why is the elevator shaft the only way in and out of the complex around which most of the action revolves?). Or one that spent less time being utterly gratuitous (it's not that I mind seeing Rhona ""Finest Lara Croft ever"" Mitra's breasts, but having her put on a bathrobe after showering and THEN having said mammaries bared when the robe slips wide open is pushing it). Or one that had something resembling a sense of humour (witness the recent TV series ""The Invisible Man"").It's not bad as a straight horror thriller, but it could have been so much more... ultimately the movie really is hollow, man. (Apologies if someone else has already made that joke.)",Hollow Man
91,hall895,They could have had a lot more fun with this,5,13 July 2007,"Hollow Man is a movie which sets up a fascinating premise, one that is seemingly ripe with possibilities. There are so many directions the filmmakers could have gone with this one. Unfortunately they chose to go in a dark, dreary, depressing and not particularly enjoyable direction. Basically they turned it into just another slasher film. This movie certainly didn't have to be played entirely for laughs but if you insist on turning your lead character into such a villain at least a few lighter moments sprinkled throughout surely would have helped. As it is what we're left with is a movie with dazzling special effects and pretty much nothing else at all to recommend it.Hollow Man tells the story of brilliant scientist Sebastian Caine who, along with his small group of colleagues, is working on a top secret invisibility formula. They've been testing the procedure on animals. A scene showing an invisible gorilla being made to reappear from the inside out is the best thing the movie has to offer. It looks simply stunning. Unfortunately it's all downhill from there. Sebastian decides he'll be the first human test subject. He is made to disappear (in another visually impressive scene) but when it's time to make him reappear things go awry and he is left invisible. This apparently causes Sebastian to lose his mind and he spends the rest of the movie trying to kill everyone he knows. Yawn.Even if he decided to make his invisible man a ruthless villain director Paul Verhoeven surely could have had some fun with it. But no, his idea of ""fun"" is having the invisible man rape his neighbor. Perhaps being invisible will open the door for some ingenious criminal activity for this supposedly brilliant man? Nope, just have him go around mindlessly killing people. Playing the role of Sebastian, Kevin Bacon does the best he can to bring this invisible killer to life but he's let down by the material. And the rest of the cast is reduced to spending the whole movie spouting silly dialogue and running around all terrorized by the invisible lunatic in laughable, nonsensical and interminable action sequences. Yes, in typical slasher movie fashion this villain just won't die. And so the movie goes on and on and on...and never gets any better. In fact it seems to get worse as it goes. Give this movie a little credit for the impressive visuals but it gets no credit for anything else. Rarely have the appearance of the closing credits bought such blessed relief.",Hollow Man
92,vip_ebriega,Hollow script.,4,21 May 2008,"My Take: Special effects can't save the predictable script, cardboard characters and unrelenting violence. HOLLOW MAN is nothing more than a B-movie, but look how expensive it is! It must have cost a fortune to create believable special effects illusions as an invisible man. These special effects are exquisitely impressive, they're an eye-fest! But, in terms of plot, script and characters, HOLLOW MAN is as modified as an old drive-in B-movie from Roger Corman. Besides having a barren script, the film is also too unpleasant and bloody. Although it is quite natural for a movie like this to be intense (as in any film boldly directed by Paul Verhoeven), the violence here is too intense, it's hardly a form of entertainment.Kevin Bacon is fine in the role of Sebastian Cane, a scientist who volunteers to be injected with a serum that allows one to be invisible to the human eye. The serum is discovered by a bunch of scientist led by a headstrong female scientist named Linda McKay (Elisabeth Shue). Josh Brolin and Kim Dickens are among the other scientists. Their experiment is a success, but with every success as great as this, there's bound to be a drawback. Jeez, don't they ever learn? Anyway, Sebastian turns himself to a psychopath who uses his invisibility to do all manner of mayhem that gets lethal as it goes on.In short, HOLLOW MAN is just another creature-feature with a big cast. Comparing this to ANACONDA, another low-light in the creature feature genre, it makes that one look like a work of a great artist. Both are mediocre and unimpressive, as both are extremely weak on the writing department, but at least ANACONDA had more suspense. HOLLOW MAN, even with blood gushing at every opportunity, not a moment is done with genuine tension. The film is scary for a younger audience, and even to some young teenagers, but anyone who has seen a lot of other movies of this kind will feel that the presence of the creature is more than a whimper.No character in this film is engaging or interesting (perhaps what's interesting is that how could these stars accept such half-baked character roles). Bacon is fine and creepy as the lead monstrosity, but after he is made invisible and turning him into an invisible psycho, he's given not much at all to do, as is every character in this hollow-scripted HOLLOW MAN.Rating: ** out of 5.",Hollow Man
93,jhclues,Verhoeven Misses the Mark,4,3 July 2002,"Within the realm of Science Fiction, two particular themes consistently elicit interest, were initially explored in the literature of a pre-cinematic era, and have since been periodically revisited by filmmakers and writers alike, with varying degrees of success.  The first theme, that of time travel, has held an unwavering fascination for fans of film, as well as the written word, most recently on the screen with yet another version of the H.G. Wells classic, `The Time Machine.'  The second theme, which also manages to hold audiences in thrall, is that of invisibility, which sparks the imagination with it's seemingly endless and myriad possibilities.  And this theme, too, has again become the basis for a film adapted from another H.G. Wells classic, `The Invisible Man,' the realization of which, here, is `Hollow Man,' directed by Paul Verhoeven, and starring Kevin Bacon and Elisabeth Shue.Sebastian Caine (Bacon) and his colleagues have for some time been conducting experiments for the U.S. Government, exploring the possibility and practicality of invisibility, which they have, at last, achieved in a number of the primates upon which they have tested their method.  They have, in fact, progressed to the point that effecting the invisibility is assured; their only problem now is bringing the subject back to the original `visual' state of being.  It's a problem, however,  that Caine, after diligent effort and too many hours in the lab, has solved-- or so he thinks.  And when the application of his theory on a live subject is successful, he decides to present the results to the board of directors, in an effort to thereby maintain the funding necessary for the continuation of the project.At the last minute, though, Caine demurs, fearing that control of the project will be wrested from him before they can proceed to the next level-- the testing of a human subject.  And he takes it upon himself to become that subject, securing the assistance of his research team by telling them that they've been given approval by the board to do so.  But something goes wrong, and Caine becomes trapped in his cloak of invisibility; and as he and his team struggle to find the solution to his considerable dilemma before it's too late, it all begins to take a toll on Caine's mind.  And suddenly, his fear of losing funding and control becomes inconsequential, as he finds himself facing the imminent danger of losing much more than that.  Now there's a very real chance that he may lose everything-- Including himself.Verhoeven has crafted what is initially an exciting, even thought provoking film; he establishes a good pace and uses the F/X at his disposal to great effect, though he does tend to allow the striking visuals to overwhelm the character development.  Anyone familiar with `The Invisible Man,' or actually anyone who can logically follow the progression of the story, will know early on that Caine is not destined for happier times.  Still, Verhoeven has a style of storytelling that is definitely going to capture the attention and engage his audience.  But he seems bent on rushing toward the climax, and along the way he abandons any and all of the nuance that has made his film thus far successful, opting to enter into a final sequence that is nothing more than a mindless blood-and-gore fest that betrays his audience and everything he's worked for earlier in the film.  Rather than seeking an intelligent resolution to Caine's suffering, and using some inventiveness and imagination to take the film to it's inevitable conclusion, Verhoeven takes the low road, and though it may succeed on a purely visceral level, any meaning one could derive from the story dissolves like so many ashes in the wind, along with anything that would have made this a memorable film.  And it's a shame, because Verhoeven has it at a higher level than much of what is offered in this genre, and he allows it to sink unnecessarily to one much lower.Kevin Bacon does a good job of creating a character that is believable, if only on the surface, which seemingly serves Verhoeven's purposes perfectly. There's little depth to Bacon's portrayal, but it has more to do with his director's agenda than his own acting abilities.  Verhoeven simply does not allow Bacon the time to develop Caine to any extent; the character is mainly a vessel around which Verhoeven can build his story, and toward that end, it works.  The film would have been better served, however, had Verhoeven and Bacon collaborated more closely on at least developing a bond between Caine and the audience that would have prompted some emotional involvement on the viewers part, something that would have drawn them in a bit, rather than leaving them at the gate, as it were, as mere observers of an F/X laden extravaganza.Elisabeth Shue comports herself well in the role of Linda McKay, Caine's willing accomplice in the ill-fated experiment, but it's basically a thankless part that offers little challenge, especially to an actor of Shue's caliber.  The same can be said of Kim Dickens (so magnificent in the 2001 film, `Things Behind the Sun').  Her character, Sarah Kennedy, does little more than support the action and F/X.  Both actors are capable of so much more, and deserve better than what they are given to work with here.The supporting cast includes Josh Brolin (Matthew), Greg Grunberg (Carter), Joey Slotnick (Frank), Mary Randle (Janice) and William Devane (Dr. Kramer). Entertaining to a point, and even successful on a certain (low) level, `Hollow Man' is one of those films that leaves you contemplating what could have been.  Like an annual fireworks display, it will give you some momentary thrills, but after awhile it'll begin to blend in with all the others you've seen, without anything special to set it apart.  And it's too bad, because given the talent and abilities of those involved here, it could have been so much more.  I rate this one 4/10.",Hollow Man
94,CharltonBoy,Film:visibly Stunning...Plot:Stunningly invisible!,7,18 February 2001,The Hollow Man is one of those films that in my opinion is a vehicle for ground breaking special affects and more than likely started without a script just an idea. The special affects are outstanding and make this film worth watching alone but it's just a shame that the story had more holes in it than Kevin Bacon's mask. It was so far fetched as to spoil it it a little but if you sit back and watch this film without thinking to deeply about the plot you should enjoy it. One thing i DID like about the story was it's honesty. When the scientist turns himself invisible he did what 99% of red hot blooded males would do and that is watch a beautiful woman naked. if i was invisible i would do just that ( not the rape thing) but the voyuer thing. 7 out of 10.,Hollow Man

He just nailed his character and the other ones were OK too but he just was good.This movie is really something that is hard to describe and I must say to all of you, just see for yourselves. If you do not like Paul Verhoeven' s films than I must advise you to stay away. But if you thought Robocop, Total Recall, Basic Instinct and Starship Troopers were all in the good  area then you must see this one. You just might like it. I myself am not so sure what to think of this movie. During the break I was pretty much convinced (yes, we have breaks in the middle of the movies, strange isn't it?) that this was a good movie. After seeing the whole of it though I was not so convinced anymore. I mean, there was just a bunch of stupidity going on in the end. So many cliché's I don't even want to talk about. OK the effects were great, the acting was pretty good, it was funny at times, plus there were some cool and memorable moments (like the beginning with the rat), but it all faded into the background in the end. Why is that? You are wondering, well, as a matter of fact, the way I judge a movie always depends on the end. If I'm not sure if the film is good and the ending ROCKS, the film is good and if the whole film is pretty good, but the ending is weak (like in this film) the whole judgement I give is affected and so I must say that this film is neither pretty good, nor just OK.

Hollow Man never truly addresses why this genius scientist becomes so twisted and dark in the first place and starts killing everyone but Hollow Man's still really good and versatile. It's an all-time underrated sci-fi thriller I love it. Kevin Bacon's classic I love me some Kevin Bacon. Kevin reveals his butt for all to see in Hollow Man.

Elisabeth Shue's my favorite kind of shoe to wear she's so incredibly hot and sexy and beautiful, honestly. I love her in this as Shue plays the protagonist and Bacon plays the antagonist. It's not too often you see a film with the main star and lead as the villain. It works very well, just like The Shining. Hollow Man's a must see that's highly rewatchable and recommended. Josh Brolin's in good support I love him in this too. Hollow Man has tons of nudity, well, actually Paul Verhoeven's other works, Showgirls and Basic Instinct have tons of nudity, this just has lots. Kim Dickens and Rhona Mitra each appear nude showing off their boobs and Elisabeth appears in some white pairs of undies in a number of separate scenes and her short blonde hair looks insane. Elisabeth is all-time underrated too I love her. Animals are really sweet, and you should never harm them, especially for stupid, inhumane reasons.

I rented this movie in the video store when I was in a high school I was a seventeen year old teen who I was looking for a good movie and I remember asking the owner for this movie if it is good, who recommend me to give it a chance. I watch it and I like then, today I love it. I got this movie on Blu-ray disc the director's cut that I absolutely love it. Plot: Brilliant scientist Sebastian Caine (Kevin Bacon) has one passion: to uncover the secrets of invisibility. Working with his research team in a top-secret government facility. Caine will stop at nothing to achieve his goal, even if it means making himself the project's first human guinea pig. But Caine and his team soon find out that making someone invincible is the easy part - it's keeping him sane that's difficult. Now Caine is a killer on the loose and his team, led by ex-girlfriend Linda (Elisabeth Shue) and her new beau Matt (Josh Brolin) , must destroy him. But how do you stop something - or someone - you can't see? I love the cast: I think Kevin bacon did great job as the main scientist Sebastian Caine, more scientist who of course makes him self project's first human guinea pig who loses his mind and starts killing his fellow workers. I really love Kevin Bacon in this movie and I thought in my personal opinion he acted brilliant as the mad scientist who becomes a killer on the loose. I thought Elisabeth Shue did great as our female lead and hero. Josh Brolin is in it as Elisabeth Shue's boyfriend who is also a scientist. Kim Dickens, Greg Grunberg, Joey Slotnick and William Devane. Jerry Goldsmith did a music for this movie, I miss Jerry Goldsmith I thought he made a pretty good score. Mark Goldblatt he edited a lot of action movies if you hear about this guy he edited a lot of action movies who directed The Punisher (1989) and Dead Heat (1988) and he also edited Commando and Rambo: First Blood Part II, The Terminator and Terminator 2: Judgment Day. The movie has great special effects I know Paul Verhoeven was really disappointed with the film, well anyone could make that film. No one could make RoboCop like Paul Verhoeven did no one could make Starship Troopers like Paul Verhoeven did, but this seem like typical Hollywood film like anyone cold have make. That is why he want back to his homeland deiced to make movies there. I don't understand that I really don't. I think Paul your wrong, cause not anyone would make this film but you. How many movies invisable man rated-R slasher films with a lot of blood and t**s you see this days? You knew back then none. But there is really not that many invisible man movies period, especially R-rated one and especially slasher one's. It doesn't hold back on the gore and it doesn't hold back on the nudity. In my honest opinion this is my favorite invisible man movie! I don't understand the hate for this movie I think Elisabeth Shue did a solid job as the main led and hero. You have really great special effects of an invisible man. You have blood gory, huge explosions. The ending scene in which Elisabeth Shue was trapped in the freezer with Josh Brolin was brilliant how Linda constructs an electromagnet using a defibrillator and other equipment, to open the freezer door. That was excellent scene, I love the scene in which Linda appears in the elevator and fires the flamethrower at Caine, just like Kurt Russell in The Thing (1982) one of my favorite horror films, she burns Caine skin off and corrupt his plans. I love those scenes I love that trapped scientist are fighting for their lives and fight's off invisible man the killer. Only two of the scientist mains as a sole survivor. I don't know what you want? You have a good fantastic horror film that is not that bad like mainly people are saying and claiming. For 2000 special effects they do look for the most part pretty good. I don't really think Gladiator's effects were that much better that Hallow Man's but oh well. The rating I give to this film is 8/10. Anything under 7 would be ridiculous, as anyone claiming this isn't at least a GOOD slasher rated-R horror film (it is sure as hell better than all the comic movies that get high scores) needs their head examined. It is my favorite Paul Verhoeven film and I really miss the director and his movies.Hollow Man is a 2000 American-German science fiction horror film directed by Paul Verhoeven and starring Kevin Bacon, Elisabeth Shue and Josh Brolin. Bacon portrays the title character, a scientist who renders himself invisible and goes on a killing spree, a story inspired by H. G. Wells' novel The Invisible Man.

100,The_Movie_Cat,"""Hi Doc, I haven't seen you for a few days"".",5,22 July 2001,"WARNING: REVIEW CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS - ONLY READ IF YOU'VE SEEN THE FILM
For some reason, the world of television is judged on the writers. The world of film is always judged by the directors. The improbably named Hollow Man (He's not hollow, he's invisible) has met with some derision in the press, and cited as another of Verhoeven's big failures.However, this seems to place the blame unfairly in Vehoeven's court, who has, after all, to contend with an incredibly dated script. While the use of sex, mega violence, huge explosions and state of the art FX is modern, the plot lines and character dynamics are no more advanced than a film from 1933.While the effects are generally outstanding, and visually thrilling, the two-dimensional predictability of the support cast and cliched love triangle workings drag the whole thing down into a (pardon the pun) seen that, done that movie. Characterisation is spelt out in cranky exposition, and any plot developments are clearly signposted. Kevin Bacon brings a lot of personality to the role, and does well using largely his voice. Yet this rather predictable horror set up shows its dated origins by the fact that when Bacon finally begins his killing spree, the first people to get wiped are the black character and the fat guy. It's like the 80s and 90s never happened.Some of the problems relating to invisibility are addressed - such as Bacon having transparent eyelids. However, the fact that he wouldn't be able to see in the first place if no light was reflecting off his eyes is glossed over. As is the fact that food vanishes when entering his mouth, and yet we can see internal injections. And when the film ends with Bacon being hit multiple times by a flame thrower, smashed over the head with a crowbar and being fried alive by several thousand vaults - and still walking! - you realise this is just a mindless popcorn fest. It's okay, but you expect more from the man who gave us Robocop and Starship Troopers - dumb films on the outside, but with satirical bent and political subtext.Into this context we have the rape scenes. Most of these are implied, though their presentation is used more for titillation than actual commentary. What could have been an intriguing morality tale is blown up into the most dubious form of entertainment. ""Roll up, roll up, come and see the woman raped by the invisible man."" Okay, the camera does cut away (though after Rhona Mitri has had her breasts groped) but the way in which such an act could be presented as popcorn fodder is risible in the extreme.And when Bacon's big verbal pay-off is the charmless ""I always knew you were a bitch!"" you can see the level of intellect gone into a script that sorely needed a second draft. Aptly named, for it has no depth or meaning, Hollow Man shows the innate worthlessness of CGI: Claude Rains may have had cups on string, but the performances, direction and dialogue made it a hugely greater film than this one. Ultimately Hollow Man ranks along with Basic Instinct as the worst of Verhoeven's English-language films. And yes, that does include Showgirls.",Hollow Man

102,BroadswordCallinDannyBoy,Nothing new to see here.,4,10 December 2007,"After seeing this movie I was trying to decide on what was the point behind what I just saw. After careful consideration it can only be concluded that this is yet another example, provided courtesy of Hollywood, that awesome special effects do not make a good movie. A big budget of $95 million also won't get you a good movie. A glossy movie with slick production value maybe, but the good depends on what you do with it.""Hollow Man"" takes an interesting premise that most of us have probably considered at one point or another. I was definitely considering it when I decided to watch this movie. The premise itself is simple: what would you do if you were invisible? The possibilities here are plentiful so too bad that ""Hollow Man"" degenerates to a routine slasher flick. It's quite remarkable. The fantastic special effects that start the film: first a mouse being eaten by an invisible creature with the blood splatter giving us some hint as to what ate it. Then the rendering visible of this creature via a counter injection to the invisibility serum we see the veins of a living creature begin to appear. Soon there is a whole map of a circulatory system, then of the muscles and finally we see a gorilla. Pretty cool and a great example of Hollywood magic. Of course this all takes place in one of those ""secret government labs"" that Hollywood has neatly hidden in every city, but that's hardly what is wrong with the movie.What's wrong is that they take this interesting idea that is given a great introduction and then just use it as an excuse for violence. The catch is that the killer is invisible so you can't see him and that's scary. Please, even when the killer in a slasher movie is visible he is hard to spot and has been since the slasher genre was born. I guess the only new thing here is that well lit areas can even hide the killer. Though that hardly provides anything interesting since it all leads to the same old violence. Also so much is made about this invisibility as a secret government experiment yet many logical things about the aspect of being invisible are totally ignored. That's quite a shame, since they at least could have created a slasher kill who's REALLY different and give us something new to see (or not see). They didn't. --- 4/10Rated R for violence and profanity. Ages 13+",Hollow Man

Claude Rains shocked the world with THE INVISIBLE MAN in 1933, well now, Kevin Bacon has shocked *us* with HOLLOW MAN. One of the most thrilling horror films ever.

Becoming the basis for a spoof joke in SCARY MOVIE 2, this film grabs you by the throat and never lets go. The first 45 minutes or so are slow, developing the characters and showing how their experiments work. The second half is exciting and appealing to most action and horror fans.

106,RonellSowes,Mildly Intense Decently Entertaining,5,16 February 2021,"A scientist tests his breakthrough experiment on himself that leads to unseen and deadly results. That logline could be slapped onto a number of scifi flicks such as: The Fly, Dr Jekyll & Mr Hyde or as in this case,Hollow Man. Kevin Bacon plays the titular role of Sebastian, a brilliant and arrogant scientist who is working on an invisibility serum. However, finding something to turn you invisible isn't actually the problem. Its finding something to turn you back. Sebastian experiments on himself and is stuck invisible. His associates Linda, Matt and the rest of the team look for an answer as the already conceited Sebastian turns psychotic. The real thriller/horror aspect doesn't fully kick in till the final act of the film. Once it does, the film doesn't do much to stay grounded or logical but does what it wishes and hopes you don't question why or how. The 'finale' is sprawling and a too drawn out too call it one sequence. It's more like three endings blended together, that aims high and falls low.
Despite receiving second billing to Elizabeth Shue, Kevin Bacon plays the lead character with a convincing performance. The film also includes a young Josh Brolin who brings the same solemnity he does in all his work.
Although it is certainly no display of high quality filmmaking Hollow Man is still a mildly intense and amusing science fiction thriller.",Hollow Man

Elizabeth Schue is believable as the strong woman who is more than a match for him. Josh Brolin is restrained and believable as a research scientist. The plot went along smoothly, with many cringe worthy moments. High production values, great special effects. Incredible special effects. There were some flaws, however. First off, why are all the scientists thirty-something? They don't hire middle aged scientists anymore? When Sebastian runs amok, there are too many instances where a little more thought should have gone into it. Naturally, the first one killed off is the black girl. Then, Bacon's character seems indestructible. He gets set on fire with a flame thrower. After extended moments of him writhing while engulfed in fire, the flames suddenly go out and he's none the worse for wear. He bashes people with a crowbar, inflicting huge gashes, but when he's hit by it, he's only momentarily stunned. The others never close the deal when he's vulnerable and let him recover to fight some more. Josh Brolin receives a horrific gash to his abdomen; like an unclosed appendectomy. He inexplicably stops bleeding and goes on to perform strenuous gymnastics in the elevator shaft with not so much as a wince. The lack of believability in the final climax nearly ruined the movie.

109,Movie-12,Great special effects lost in a typical slasher movie. ** (out of four),5,5 March 2001,"HOLLOW MAN / (2000) ** (out of four)By Blake French:	""It's amazing what you can do when you don't have to look at yourself in the mirror."" Sebastian Caine	It sure would be wondrous to become invisible; capable of marching around without the disadvantage of being seen by the naked eye. With our current technological revolution, invisibility could be possible in the near future. ""Hallow Man,"" the new suspense thriller from director Paul Verhoeven, looks into that very intriguing possibility, and does so with eye-popping visual effects. Unfortunately the movie losses most of its interest when the concepts become lost in yet another typical slasher movie.
	The film stars Kevin Bacon as an obscene and egotistical scientist named Sebastian Caine. He uses himself to experiment on a new invisibility formula, it works, and he becomes even more fiendish, sex-crazed, and eventually even murderous. But not without probable cause: his fellow scientists, including Linda McKay (Elisabeth Shue), Matthew Kensington (Josh Brolin), Sarah Kennedy (Kim Dickens), Carter Abbey (Greg Grunberg), Frank Chase (Joey Slotnick), and Janice Walton (Mary Randle), along with a Pentagon official, Dr. Howard Kramer (William Devane), all believe the treatments cause negative reactions in his body. Therefore, in order to eliminate the intentions of halting the project entirely, Caine reverts to grisly serial killer, murdering everyone involved with the scientific studies. 	I found ""Hallow Man"" undesirable for numerous reasons, one of them centering on the Kevin Bacon character himself. He starts off as a devilish lunatic and turns into an even more devilish lunatic. If was a more significant change in his character, we may have been more surprised when the film becomes preoccupied with endless amounts of bloodshed and graphic violence. The scientific invisibility concept is just a gimmick to pump new energy into an old retread: the slasher movie. There is some merit here: the killer's intentions are clear, the violence is focused, and the characters are smart in more ways than one. However, the film adds nothing new into the increasingly desperate genre. 	""Hallow Man"" also lacks terror and suspense. Similar to Paul Verhoeven's previous features, like the unquestionably violent but flat ""RoboCop,"" ""Total Recall"" and ""Starship Troopers,"" there is plenty of violent content in here, but where is the tension? The energy buildup? The suspenseful sequences? They do not exist. There is so much potential in the writer's ideas it's too bad the film does not amount to more than mindless blood and gore. 	The special effects are outstanding. They can not be nearly described, but must be seen to believe. Is ""Hallow Man"" worth seeing for the half dozen or so sequences portraying Oscar nominated visual effects? Not really. On a mechanical and technical level this movie is outstanding, I just wish the filmmakers took more time in writing surreal scenes and developing nail-biting suspense than finding remarkable special effects artists.",Hollow Man

111,movieguy1021,Hollow Man: 5/10,5,18 November 2002,"As you can see from the very clever tagline, Hollow Man is about thinking you're alone. But you should think again. Evidentally, all the words I've used so far are more advanced than the scriptwriters' vocabulary.Kevin Bacon plays Sebastian Caine, an egotistical but brilliant scientist. The script makes us know that he's an egomanic early on, but when Bacon is invisible, they seem to make us forget that. In fact, he's so self-oriented that he names all of his medicines after himself. OK, we get it! Anyway, he and his team are working on making objects invisible. Why not? So after not getting approval from the government, Sebastian goes ahead and tests it out on himself.But, alas, that wouldn't be much of a movie. Sebastian's team, which includes Linda (Elisabeth Shue) who is Sebastian's former lover, Matthew (Josh Brolin), Linda's secret lover, and Sarah (Kim Dickens), who happens to be a vet, can't turn him back to his visible form. And, of course, Sebastian goes mad.Special effects are the film's saving grace. We see all of Bacon's transformations into visible beings and invisible beings, and, despite being somewhat gruesome, were very intense and actually looked real (except I don't really know what everything in the body look like). When Bacon had his facemask on, I totally believed that it was Bacon who was invisible. The script didn't do that. The special FX did.On the other hand, the script, as I've said before, isn't exactly on a Shakespearean level. It's not even on a Sesame Street level. It's something that director Paul Verhoeven realized that he needed to have in order to make a movie so called it together at the last minute. You can tell how deep it is when all the dialogue is what's happening. ""It's coming down!"" ""Keep climbing!"" And the script had a lot of medical/scientific mumbo-jumbo. Don't expect us to know what you're talking about. Round to the lowest common demonator.You could call this a ""popcorn movie"", except there isn't a lot of action or exciting scenes it it. In fact, I wasn't thrilled at all. I was entertained, but not tense. The only action was at the tacked-on end that seemed too abrupt. If there had been a steady amount of action all throughout, it would have been easier to swallow.The movie didn't know where to go. It didn't hold onto one plot. Hollow Man tried to appeal to many demographs: thrill-seekers, action afficondos, romantics, 30-year-old dateless men. It, however, didn't really let us explore on those. And the characters, although we know some about Sebastian, we know diddly-squat about the other half-dozen supporting characters, who just seem to be there when the ""script"" called for it.Well, there you go.

The original film was in my opinion very entertaining, and especially the effects were well done considering how old the movie is. Of course, today effects are easy.

Other than that Kevin Bacon is one of my favorites and even though he made a pretty lousy choice when appearing in this movie, i still thought he was okay.

However, ""Hollow Man"" is Verhoeven's weakest sci/fi effort though it's not his worst film (""Showgirls"" has that honor). ""Hollow Man"" starts off in the right direction with a team of scientists doing invisibility experiments on animals. They test a serum on one of the animals that brings that animal back to normal. Then one of the scientists (Kevin Bacon) decides to try the invisibility experiment on himself. The stuff that makes him invisible works, but the stuff that makes him normal doesn't. As time keeps passing by and the longer he stays invisible, he proceeds to turn into a raving madman. The first half of ""Hollow Man"" is dynamite. The special effects scenes when the animal reappears and when Bacon turns invisible are impressive. But it turns real nasty in the second half when the movie turns into a slasher film. Verhoeven once again has to display graphic violence like in his other films. The last 30 minutes of ""Hollow Man"" was especially hard to endure. I think this film would have had a better second half if they had stuck with the idea of finding a serum that would have brought Bacon back from being invisible. Another thing in ""Hollow Man"" that was kind of ridiculous was all the sexuality and nudity (another Verhoeven specialty). One scene that was really annoying was the one where the invisible scientist enters a neighbor's apartment without her knowing it (how can she know if he's invisible) and proceeds to do you know what. Isn't it about time Verhoeven made a movie without graphic violence, sex, and nudity? I doubt that will ever happen. Nevertheless, there are things to like in ""Hollow Man"". The special effects are an asset, and Elisabeth Shue, one of my favorite actresses, is very good as a fellow scientist who happens to be a former girlfriend of Bacon.

119,chrisbrown6453,Hollow Man combines spectacular special effects with elements of horror to create a film about the dangers of tampering with revolutionary scientific knowledge.,8,6 July 2001,"Scientist Sebastian Caine (Kevin Bacon) is on the verge of scientific revolution and world fame. Having successfully applied his invisibility formula on animals and reappeared a gorilla with the perfected serum that regains visibility, Sebastian and his chief colleagues, ex-lover Linda McKay (Elisabeth Shue) and her clandestine boyfriend Matt Kensington (Josh Brolin), are ready to approach the Pentagon scientist (William Devane: Space Cowboys) with their government-funded top-secret discovery. However, Sebastian is overwhelmed by ambition, and first convinces Linda and Matt to secretly aid him in applying the formula on himself in order to broaden his research and be the first human to experience the process. To their astonishment, the experiment proves partially faulty and Sebastian is trapped in invisibility. Horror ensues from Sebastian's mental transformation as he discovers boundless levels of power within his invisible state. Free to unleash all contained malicious tendencies, Sebastian will do anything to preserve his unique gift.Hollow Man revels in the spectacle of the physical transformations --from invisibility to visibility, and vice-versa-- of its two subjects, the gorilla and subsequently, the protagonist. Hollow Man may be regarded as a triumph of cinematic visual effects. Hollow Man successfully integrates special effects to character transformation, by showing the appearance or disappearance of the intricate layers of the body. The visualization of the layers between the skin and the skeleton is realistic, and thus, sustains Hollow Man's efforts to portray a world of futuristic science. In addition, the monstrous end-result of the protagonist's transformation offers an intriguing premise, one which Verhoeven relates to Plato's writings on invisibility which state that ""...morality is...defined by what others know and expect of us."" In this sense, the character of Sebastian Caine is adequately established as a futuristic monster with universal appeal. However, in spite of an attractive premise that revisits the biblical notion of ""forbidden knowledge"", and of a character that confirms the disturbing fact that ""...scientific knowledge is never safe from [criminal] exploitation,""  Hollow Man fails to resist its own downfall: the story abandons the psychological exploration of the monster, and instead focuses on the sophisticated visual representations of it.

While the actors try to make the best with what they have, Paul Verhoeven tries to goose us a little.  He succeeds in a few instances, and he does manage to hold your attention for a while, but the ending is the weakest link in the movie.  Had there been a stronger ending, the movie would've been a little better.  As it is now, it's a good exercise in visual effects territory, but there are so many other possibilities that lay with the story of an invisible human being.",Hollow Man
121,romanorum1,It's All about the Special F/X and Nothing Else,4,3 March 2017,"The opening credits feature pictures of molecules and scrambled letters. This is another movie where someone tests some ridiculous experiment on himself and thing go awry. These guys never seem to understand that they will become entrapped inside their new character. To make my point, refer to the following stories: ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hide,"" ""The Invisible Man,"" and ""The Fly."" In ""Hollow Man"" Kevin Bacon stars as Sebastian Caine, who is an egocentric and unethical scientist. He heads a six-unit research and development team whose purpose is to make living things invisible, and vice versa (reversion). The crew, entirely financed under the auspices of the Pentagon, includes ex-girlfriend Linda McKay (Elizabeth Shue) and her current suitor Matthew Kensington (Josh Brolin). Ignoring procedures and rules, Sebastian decides to initiate human testing – on himself. On making history he tells his staff, ""You make it by seizing the moment!"" So he is the first human guinea pig. He does no real good in his new situation. One of his first acts as an invisible man is to unbutton the blouse of the dozing, high strung co-worker Bianca (Kim Dickens) and squeeze a boob. Ten days into the experiment, he cannot get back to his original self and his behavior becomes depraved with violent streaks. At least a latex skin is poured over him to give him a humanoid look. He has been enamored with a well-endowed, attractive single woman (Rhona Mitra) who lives just across from him in another unit of his apartment building. Debauched, and as he cannot be seen, he decides to force his way onto her. How she inadvertently admits him in the first place is totally ridiculous: She sees no one through the door peephole and ventures outside her apartment while dank and wearing just a housecoat, and while wondering who rang the doorbell. Of course he easily sleazes in and rapes her. Sebastian's mind continues to degenerate. He becomes murderous and begins to stalk his own team after they decide to turn him over to their superiors. Now the movie morphs into a slasher flick as team members are picked off one by one in the expected order. Will the madman be stopped before they are all dead? Who cares? Special effects are the real stars here. There is a nice opening sequence with a visible rat: it slinks along to a water dish before being quickly snatched and killed by an invisible predator. Early on an invisible gorilla becomes visible after an irradiated serum injection. As the injected chemical fans out throughout the bloodstream, body parts gradually become visible, revealing layers of tissue, muscle, fat, bone, organs, and skin. But filmmakers like Paul Verhoeven must realize that great visual effects do not by themselves equate to an enjoyable motion picture experience. Thus, on the negative side the acting is so-so, and there is little, if any, chemistry between the two protagonist leads, Shue and Brolin. Worse, the characters are not especially likable. Then there is the story-line that deteriorates into absurdity.",Hollow Man

Kevin Bacon plays the title character, who turns invisible and starts raping women, killing dogs and people. It's a little unpleasant, but at least now I know what I was getting into by rewatching it. When I went to see it in the theater back in 2000, I was expecting something else, so I didn't like it so much then. Now, I'm more familiar with Verhoeven's body of work and can see that this is still in the same vein as a lot of his other stuff. Made me nostalgic for the 90's Verhoeven era, when he was always pumping out some sleazy movie for us to love or hate...or love/hate.Kevin Bacon can play diabolical quiet well, and the rest of the cast are on their game too. Elisabeth Shue makes for a great heroine, as always. Cool to look back now and recognize Rhona Mitra, Kim Dickens and Greg Grunberg, who I didn't know then but have become familiar with since.The visual effects are very impressive, considering this is twenty years ago, the height of CGI shoddiness.

125,p-jonsson,Not fantastic but quite okay,6,8 May 2013,"I have been unusually lucky with my SyFy-channel movie watching lately. I had no idea what this movie was really but there was nothing else on last night and I also noticed that it was directed by Paul Verhoeven which have directed quite a few movies that I really liked so I decided to give it a try. As it turned out, this is another movie that is somewhat above the usual standard for movies given on SyFy.It has a rating on 27% on Rotten Tomatoes which is just bullshit. But then, the so called ""professional critics"" used by the Rotten Tomatoes are dimwits who trash every movie that is not ""intellectual"" enough for their self-imagined refined tastes. I do not know why they continue to use these clowns for their official rating system instead of the real audience? On IMDb it holds a 5.6 out of 10 rating which is more realistic. I was hesitating between 7 and 6. In the end I gave it a 6 because, as I said in the title, it is a quite okay movie but not a fantastic one.The story of the movie is a fairly standard one. Scientist experiments on himself, experiment goes wrong, scientist goes mad, hack hack, chop chop, scientist dies, happy ending for the remaining survivors. Thus the movie pretty much relies on its special effects which are indeed quite good. The various invisible effects, not to mention the scenes where Caine is partially visible due to smoke or water effects, are quite enjoyable to watch.Kevin Bacon is making quite a performance as a very disagreeable fanatic scientist. He is doing a remarkably good job of it even when he is covered by a latex mask which of course is quite a feat being deprived of any facial expressions. The rest of the cast was fairly standard Hollywood fare, that is, fairly bland.On the whole I found the movie quite enjoyable. It was perhaps a bit slow at the beginning and Cain's show of megalomaniacal attitudes was indeed becoming a bit tiresome after a while. As I said, his roles was a very disagreeable one. Once he became invisible things started to become more interesting although it took a wee time for things to speed up even then.It was certainly not a wasted movie evening and the movie is worth at least 6 out of 10 stars.",Hollow Man

127,Rammstein-2,Hollow flick,4,16 September 2000,"One could wish that an idea as good as the ""invisible man"" would work better and be more carefully handled in the age of fantastic special effects, but this is not the case. The story, the characters and, finally the entire last 20 minutes of the film are about as fresh as a mad-scientist flick from the early 50's. There are some great moments, mostly due to the amazing special effects and to the very idea of an invisible man stalking the streets. But alas, soon we're back in the cramped confinement of the underground lab, which means that the rest of the film is not only predictable, but schematic.There has been a great many remakes of old films or TV shows over the past 10 years, and some of them have their charms. But it's becoming clearer and clearer for each film that the idea of putting ol' classics under the noses of eager madmen like Verhoeven (who does have his moments) is a very bad one. It is obvious that the money is the key issue here: the time and energy put into the script is nowhere near enough, and as a result, ""Hollow Man"" is seriously undermined with clichés, sappy characters, predictability and lack of any depth whatsoever.However, the one thing that actually impressed me, beside the special effects, was the swearing. When making this kind of film, modern producers are very keen on allowing kids to see them. Therefore, the language (and, sometimes, the violence and sex) is very toned down. When the whole world blows up, the good guys go ""Oh darn!"" and ""Oh my God"". ""Hollow Man"" gratefully discards that kind of hypocrisy and the characters are at liberty to say what comes most natural to them. I'm not saying that the most natural response to something gone wrong is to swear - but it makes it more believable if SOMEONE actually swears. I think we can thank Verhoeven for that.",Hollow Man

And its concept is very modern, and intriguing. however, it has one major mistake. that is at the end when Matt was hit by the hollow man. It was obvious in the movie that his stomach was cut open, and he was bleeding very hard, and he even lost conscious for quite some time. There is no way that he can get up and run and do things like normal people do. But in the end, he was acting as if he did not lose any blood, and his stomach was not cut open.other than that, I have to say that this movie attracts my attention all the way through. Its ups and downs are quite predictable, however, they are very exciting to watch. And also, its special effects were not very realistic. The bones just look plain plastic. On the other hand, I have to say that the special effects must have spent many many hours in order to produce something shown in the movie.",Hollow Man
130,TheMarwood,You won't find anyone more disappointed with Hollow Man than Paul Verhoeven,4,25 December 2014,"Paul Verhoeven has said he made Hollow Man for all the wrong reasons and this studio hack job is definitely his least personal work. Missing is his usual satirical wit and replaced with a brain dead screenplay about a hot shot scientist who turns himself invisible and goes bananas. The first thing Sebastian does as an invisible man is feel up his co-worker's breasts and then follows that with raping his beautiful neighbor. This sounds like prime deranged Verhoeven comedic stuff, but this is so poorly executed and so bereft of his skills that it plays out as by the numbers trash. The characters are all unlikable and Elizabeth Shue is downright awful as the lead. Whether it's a smug smirk or embarrassing dialogue delivery, she gives a terrible performance. The rest of the cast can never rise above the junk plotting and wretched dialogue. Hollow Man turns into a slasher by the second act and the film goes on autopilot - dispatching of less important characters, which can come as a welcome relief as we'll never have to listen to their awful characters speak again. This is D grade material, with scientists that wouldn't tax the smarts of your standard hormonal idiot in a slasher film.

In 5 years, however, I hope that these effects are used to create a decent movie that has anything intelligent to say.At least ""Memoirs of an Invisible Man"" could laugh at itself.  This is just entertainment for the masses-- gratuitous violence and random nudity just because it'll evoke a hoot from the audience.We've seen this all before.  Whatever balance Paul Verhoeven found with RoboCop and Starship Troopers, it's gone now-- this movie wasn't funny, it wasn't scary, and it wasn't clever.

This film scares people in a mind sense and it's not like the all to common past of blood and guts horror films. Many will say this is just a modern rerun of the Invisible Man thriller, but this movie played with the viewers mind by guessing from scene to scene as to when the next thing would happen. Elisabeth Shue and Kevin Bacon both give good performances as research scientists who have their experiment go wrong and you have the Kevin Bacon character go invisible only to then cause havoc and terror.

Some reviewers have stated that do other things if they were invisible instead of glimpsing at women- yeah right! Other reviewers have bagged the movie because of the goofs. Well this is a film about being invisible people- don't take it too seriously! The only goof I noticed was that blood would stick to a person if it was thrown on him! As far as one sprinkler being set of by a flame instead of them all, I'm sorry, but some sprinkler systems trigger all of them, so that ain't a goof!See this film if you want to enjoy action/thriller involving invisibility! I think the trailer was am honest reflection of what the film will be about, so if that doesn't appeal to you-don't see it!

135,shanfloyd,Bacon shines in this otherwise ordinary thriller.,7,27 August 2005,"I first saw Hollow Man when I was in high school. I absolutely loved the film, the concept and the character Sebastian Caine right then. During my college entrance exam I even placed a ""You should be working"" poster on the ceiling. I didn't find a single defect in the film despite the fact that it was never a major hit here. Now, as the obsession has long died out and I am able to judge the film from a completely neutral position, I watch it again with full attention.The concept is nothing new; the presentation, though attractive, nothing extraordinary. Talented, highly egotistic but sexually frustrated science genius makes a phenomenal discovery and tests it on himself. Its inevitable consequences forces him from regaining his normal life and takes the monster of revenge out of him. Yes, a common plot, screenplay is average, special effects are satisfactory and Jerry Goldsmith's original score adds to its sinister mood. But these are not responsible for my initial fascination with this film.I realise now, it's probably Kevin Bacon. There is much controversy over whether he's a good actor or not. He's done good job in some really good films like Sleepers or The River Wild. And he's been on really bad films like Tremors too. But here I think he's done an outstanding job as Caine. His every facial expression, his manner of speaking, his attitude told as if he IS the character. Even after he became invisible he remained the most fascinating thing in this movie. I loved the character Caine and I cannot imagine anyone besides Bacon to do it. Perhaps he's the only reason why I loved the film so much.",Hollow Man
136,Thrashman88,Entertaining Verhoeven Film,8,21 February 2004,"It seems a lot of IMDB comments on this film are biased, in the sense that they try to compare it to an older version. True, ""HOLLOW MAN"" is a remake of sorts of ""THE INVISIBLE MAN"", but that's where the similarities end. ""HOLLOW MAN"" is an entertaining movie,period. If you watch a movie with the intention of finding as many flaws as possible, then you shouldn't watch movies in the first place. True, some movies are plain horrendous and unbearable, but ""HOLLOW MAN"" manages to entertain and make you think what YOU would do if you were invisible and if you had your ex getting laid with one of your friends. Kevin Bacon stars as a eccentric scientist who, along with a team of collaborators, discover the way to make animals invisible. Now his mission is to make them visible again. When this team of young scientists (working, as you might guess, for the Pentagon)think they have the formula for making animals visible again, Kevin bacon volunteers to be the first to try the new experimental drug. After that, of course, things go wrong, as Kevin Bacon remains invisible for the rest of the movie and is obliged to wear a latex mask, so his collaborators know where he is. Feelings of paranoia and desperation begin to take over Kevin's character, and when he finds out that his ex girlfriend AND collaborator (Elisabeth Shue) are having a torrid affair, he finally snaps. The movie then turns into a hybrid of ""ALIEN"" and a slasher flick, but that's not saying it's a bad turn. There are scares and chills and the movie moves at a nice pace. The special effects are top notch (a quality always prevalent in ALL of Paul Verhoeven's films)as we get to see some ""body reconstitution"" sequences never seen on a movie before. If there's anything to complain about, perhaps, is the predictability of the situations herein; by the first hour of the movie you KNOW Kevin bacon will make the jump from being weird and eccentric to being a homicidal lunatic in the end. And the ending is a bit abrupt, but despite this, HOLLOW MAN is still worth watching. If you want to know what a TRULY bad movie is, then waste your money on ""FEAR DOT COM"" (With Stephen Dorf) or the even worse THE UNTOLD (or ""Sasquatsh"", with Land Henriksen).

He can't relax, listen to others or love. At the same time we're `shown' an invisible and very angry gorilla. Thus is the metaphysical argument set up: the human ego, unseen and controlling events, is the devil, The Beast. The film then proceeds to make the deeds of the beast visible  and to extend the metaphor, the human face of the egotist becomes invisible.The film does become a little formulaic after that and it is a shame that the secondary characters are undeveloped as people. But here at least is a popular movie which tells the truth about the corrupt human ego and it's terrible consequences. Without compassion, we will die: frozen and wounded in the traps our egos set for us. In the end, the devil/ego/invisible man is thrown into the fiery pit to be consumed by the refining fire.

However Kevin Bacon as Dr. Sebastian Caine does manage to stay interesting for the majority of the run-time. Reeking chaos once he is invisible keeps the viewer on edge as Caine's acts escalate from practical joking to downright vicious malevolence as his mind deteriorates to a murderous psychopath. Sadly Bacon couldn't save the generic potboiler of the film's ""slasher"" angle.The film's special effects are one of the movie's other bright spots.

Unfortunately, the movie falls flat in the second part, were it degenerates into a standard slasher movie or maybe a very bad ""Alien"" clone.

What were you expecting - Citizen Kane?In fact, this is a rather good take on one of HG Wells' more trivial tales. The theme is pretty obvious: absolute power corrupts. Absolutely. We got that. But Verhoeven knows how to have a good time with an idea like that, and he explores every creepy, nasty, depraved ramification with enormous glee. State-of-the-art effects enhance the mood, with some suitably repulsive anatomical views early on, escalating to more-visceral gore in the climax. Kevin Bacon helps by creating one of his scariest creepy-guy characters, a villain who's fundamentally human, yet a real pleasure to hate.Sure, the storyline is obvious. Hey, it was obvious in the novel, and that's considered an untouchable classic. Verhoeven has given us a good, old-style monster flick with all the modern trimmings.

This movie...",2,13 February 2005,"The Invisible Man is a fantastic movie from 1933, a cutting edge film for it's time where objects appeared to rest on top of a man who was truly invisible. Go ahead, take a look at the film, you will be shocked that it was made in 1933, it was the first true special effects movie. Come 2000, computer aided special effects seem like child's play, audiences are not blown away by special effects, instead they are disappointed if they are not done right. The special effects in Hollow Man, the update of the HG Wells story, are OK, but not the biggest problem with this film directed by Paul Verhoeven, who you might remember from Showgirls and Total Recall. Kevin Bacon plays Sebastian Caine, a scientist dabbling in the world of bio-invisibilation (yeah, I know that's not a word) but of course is battling higher ups who are threatening to take away the team's funding. So, as movie characters who are about to have their funding cutoff are prone to do, he makes the ultimate sacrifice and becomes a guinea pig for the invisibilation (yeah, I know, I used that non-word again) process. The process has dire consequences, no Caine does not die, but instead becomes a horny, violent creature, aka a guy. Now that he's invisible, Caine stalks a sexy neighbor, a co-worker, former girlfriend Linda (Elisabeth Shue), and the man who took away his funding. Then a funny thing happens, Caine becomes a new supernatural being, ""The Thing That Won't Die."" Laughing in the face of all things natural, Caine faces down death and spits in it's face, as it take what feels like hours for this creature to die, dragging the ending of the movie out. The movie is silly, stupid, and finally laughable with the way realism is sometimes used, sometimes not. There are neat possibilities in Hollow Man, but of course, not one of them is explored. For a more interesting look at an invisible being, get ready for some good old-fashioned black and white cinema, and check out the 1933 Invisible Man. Kevin Bacon will still be invisible when you come back, probably still alive at the bottom of a volcano.",Hollow Man
150,MF210,Entertaining but flawed,7,13 September 2003,"My Rating: **3/4 out of ****. Hollow Man passes as entertainment but there were some things that bothered me about the movie. Paul Verhoeven's films tend to be violent, just look at Robocop, Total Recall, Basic Instinct, and Starship Troopers. However, three out of four of those films are not gratuitous, I did find Robocop gratuitous in areas. But Hollow Man becomes very gratuitous, there are a couple scenes that might make a person get sick. The acting is one sided. Kevin Bacon is the best in the movie, he gives a solid, convincing performance. The supporting actors are mostly adequate.
Hollow Man has a weak script, the dialogue is pretty flat and uninteresting in areas. The film contains billiant special effects, they look so real, especially the pool scene. Verhoeven makes the film stylish too, by adding many point of view shots of the invisible character. In a way, I thought the film should have had a darker ending. I was so convinced by Bacon's performance that I was voting for him. It would have made a cooler ending if he won.",Hollow Man

153,danielll_rs,Film goes on the right way but then... yawn!,4,1 October 2000,"HOLLOW MAN (2000)-- Grade: C+WARNING: YOU MAY FIND SOME SPOILERS AHEADAs a Paul Verhoeven film, we should have in mind the idea that this film can't be taken that seriously. You know, this is the man who made great fun stuff (TOTAL RECALL, BASIC INSTINCT)... but also unbearable stinkers (SHOWGIRLS, STARSHIP TROOPERS). So we should also have in mind that we couldn't expect a masterpiece or something that is Oscar worthy. But we should, at least, expect a fun and maybe even scary horror/sci-fi movie. Well, I can almost say that it is. However, HOLLOW MAN is a victim of a stupid tendency in Hollywood nowadays: solve all the troubles with much, much action and illogical and totally idiotic situations.The plot of HOLLOW MAN is not original, of course. The story of the invisible man who changes his personality with his new state was used lots of times before. But Paul Verhoeven gives a new and more violent treatment to the situation. The guy really enjoys his new situation and now that none can see him, he listens to conversations and comes to know that his career is almost over because of lack of ethics, and more: the girl he loves, a colleague, is going out with another of his colleagues. So what he decides to do? F***, rape his neighbor, kill his boss, turn into a slasher murderer, why not? We can easily tolerate that, even with some huge plot holes, but why, why does this movie turn into an unbelievable mess in the last 20 minutes? Why?The first half of the movie is pretty interesting, with amazing special effects that make the gorilla and Sebastian disappear. I see an Oscar nomination for them next year. After the man becomes bad there are some scenes that only Verhoeven has courage to do. The one where he rapes the hot neighbor is sick, but oddly interesting. The same thing I say about the one where he kills his boss. However, when everyone starts to die in the laboratory... it becomes just a mess. Too violent and disgusting, and totally unbelievable! Have you ever realize that the hero (in this case the girl) always have a brilliant idea when she is just dying (in this case inside a refrigerator). Of course the other hero who has been severely hurt comes to help her. And the worst: the villain survives at least four times, even to an electric shock- and goes after the heroes! Borrowing the worst parts of DEEP BLUE SEA and MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE! Why the hell do we need that??????? A film that was much above the average has to accept so many idiotic and cliched situations- why?????? HOLLOW MAN has an intriguing directing by Paul Verhoeven and, despite the not-so-smart dialogues, the actors do a fine job. Kevin Bacon and Elisabeth Shue do what they can to save even the terrible ending.
Even with so many disappointments all over it, HOLLOW MAN is still much better than some Hollywood productions. It is pretentious without being tedious, silly without being brainless, shocking without being unwatchable. But I advise you to leave before the last 20 minutes. You know what will happen, so don't waste your patience. You will have seen a good movie. Even with the self-destructive ending, it's still worth a look.",Hollow Man
154,Mickey Knox,Superman and Wonder Woman,4,12 December 2000,"(some spoilers) - as if you wouldn't know how it'll endMy expectations for HOLLOW MAN were high. A very good commercial, a director like Paul Verhoeven and actors like Kevin Bacon and Elisabeth Shue, plus a very interesting theme - invisibility. Every premise for a great movie was accomplished. Unfortunately these things didn't matter at all. The movie was very very week, without suspense and awfully predictable. It's all about a bunch of scientists who discovered invisibility. After the tests on animals succeeded, Kevin Bacon decides to test it on himself. Once he's invisible, he changes completely, realizing the advantages of not being seen. From this to murder there's a very thin line.Hollow Man is an ill movie. It suffers of the disease that many new movies have: the special effects. From a challenging theme that could have lead the producers to a great tensed psychological thriller, Verhoeven ruins everything focusing only on special effects, without giving a damn about the real value of the movie. I must admit, the fx are awesome, probably the best i have seen since Matrix, but that's not enough to make a movie good. Actually that's the problem with the movies today. Just like Verhoeven, most directors care only about spectacular scenes - and nothing more. The exceptions are very few, and probably the Matrix is the only movie that combines perfectly fabulous special effects and great plot.
After Starship Troopers, Verhoeven disappoints again. In stead of a great film, HM is cr*p. There are only 2 reasons why you could watch this movie: 1. the special effects 2. the joke with Superman and Wonder Woman (i won't spoil this moment for you...)Okay, so what went wrong with the movie? Everything. Let's see what i can remember.--- It's not tensed at all. It should've been, but it's not.--- It's too predictable . You know from the beginning who will die and who will live.--- In stead of focusing on the psychological part, Verhoeven cares only about the effects.--- Very many cliches. --- Of course the bad guy wakes up a few times before dying.--- Just like in every low quality horror, the first rule is to let the characters separate as much as possible. Every time there is somebody alone in the lab, perfect victim for Bacon.--- Some holes in the plot. Example: at the beginning, Bacon has to scan his finger to enter the lab. After he's invisible, how can he do that?--- The ending: absolutely horrible.--- After Shue hits Bacon in the head, Bacon falls down to the ground. Then Shue and Brolin leave quietly and slowly, without looking back. Is that normal? Then Bacon gets up, attacks them, they ""kill"" him again. And then Shue screams ""I heard an explosion"" (happened minutes ago), and they suddenly run inside. Didn't she hear that explosion some time before?--- There's a scene in which you can see the microphones hanging above the actors. Come on, Mr Verhoeven , i expected much more from you!So that's about Hollow Man. What was supposed to be a great movie turned into a scam. Vote: 4 out of 10 (for the special effects)",Hollow Man

It's the people who ask for stupidness, shallowness and lack of style.Take this gem for example. 'Hollow Man' directed by the master Paul Verhoeven, the last of the uncompromising artists, is a perfect action/thriller movie. Excellent acting, fast pace, action which is stripped from all redundancy and interesting story. Plus, Sony Imageworks' visual effects are probably the best cgi effects EVER. Of course, no one likes it, 'Hollow Man' scores even less than the thing called 'Scary Movie'.The modern audience lowers the movie ideals so much, that we have to watch movies like 'Pearl Harbor'.

158,RickHarvey,I didn't see that coming,5,9 January 2010,"First of all, when watching the 1st half on the film, no way could i off predict how the second half was going to unfold. The film starts of by letting you see inside a lab that researches the possibility of invisibility. It all starts of great. The research team finds away to bring back a living thing from invisibility and while doing show, it gives you some awesome effects. It also contains some elements of romance between the three main characters , so far all is good.Then the film gets more interesting . The project leader wrongly turns himself invisible. This is the part when our minds go crazy, imagining what we'll do with that power. But i swear to god, a five year old could of came up with better and useful things to do when not being seen. The writer could only think of small minded sexual ideas to do when invisible. for the next half an hour, all Kevin Bacon does is fulfil his sexual desires which also seems totally out of his character. From starting of being a smart, sensible film, it suddenly turns into a mess. Sure it fun, but i can't stop but think how much better the film could be if the writer actually gave it some thought.But the last half an hour just goes downhill. It turns into some B movie teen horror flick, well without the scares, just random deaths. the project leader goes crazy. that right, being invisible somehow makes you crazy just like that. It just seems to far fetch. sure it fun to watch but at the same time your thinking , how hell it did turn out to be like this.Overall, as the film rolls on, it loses it creativity and instead swaps it with a small minded conclusion that anybody could just about write. The special effects are great, some funny moments and the first part was good, but after that , you just have to think how much better this film could of been",Hollow Man

160,vasco_cid,"Bad? Where, I can't see!",10,8 February 2002,"The reason Hollow Man was sunk by some is beyond me! Usually good movies are sunk by the critics and loved by general public, but Hollow Man is different, general public, found it bad or `not SO interesting', and critics found it either good or interesting. If so, now I consider myself a critic. I loved Hollow Man. Although everyone knows the story of the invisible man, it hasn't been done lately, since the 1930's really, and this 2000 remake was great, it has everything nowadays public enjoy in a movie: well known actors, interesting twists, awesome special effects, good action sequences and decent jump scenes, and this one is over-the-top in each of these categories! Also what makes Hollow Man so sweet is the fact of uniting, a great cast, Kevin Bacon, Elisabeth Shue..., a great composer Jerry Goldsmith, and a one time good director Paul Verhoven. Even being totally different as you are seeing this, you keep associating it with Basic Instinct, atmosphere, actors everything but Hollow Man is a jump forward! It really is. Paul Verhoven does his thing again, action, SFX, beautiful women nudity. Saying yes to a project in which you are out of `sight' during almost all of the movie is a big challenge, halfway through the movie Kevin Bacon turns invisible and so he stays until the end, I mean, he is there, only painted on blue, or green, to be replaced by the special effects, which are great (for any reason they were nominated to the Oscar, and unfairly lost it to Gladiator.  I don't know why) Bottom line, Hollow Man was kind of a breath of fresh air in Hollywood last year, this film can't be praised enough, I can't praise it enough, congratulations to everyone involved. 10 out of 10",Hollow Man
161,FeverDog,Mr. Bacon needs a new agent... *NOTHING BUT SPOILERS HERE*,2,4 May 2001,"Writing about bad movies usually threatens to become just a list, but filmmakers should provide an intelligent story along with creative special effects. Since Verhoeven breaks his side of the bargain, I feel blameless in forging ahead; why should I take more time with insightful, intelligent writing here than the screenwriters did??  The only way this movie could have been worse is it had starred Robin Williams and Ashley Judd.Questions:1.  If the hollow man needed sunglasses to see properly, why didn't they just turn on every light? Wouldn't they have at least a small advantage?2.  One scene Bacon had heated up the corridor to make the air temperature the same as his body so that the infrared goggles became useless. So of course the characters tossed them aside. Didn't it occur to any of them that the goggles might have been useful in other rooms with normal air temperature?  And splitting up to search the premises while being stalked by a psycho? What, was there a sale at the Movie Cliche Store?3.  Why did this movie have to dissolve into a Jason flick with a science bent? With all the millions available to the filmmakers, couldn't they be just a little more creative?4.  If you were invisible, what would you do?  Go on a rampage or screw with passersby on the street?  I'd go see every movie and show in town, maybe go to a porno theatre, drive my nemeses crazy and then set off fire alarms and generally wreak gleeful havoc all over...5.  What happened to the neighbor that Bacon attacked? And wouldn't the boss's drowning have raised any suspicion? 6.  Maybe I missed it, but what exactly was the purpose of these experiments?7.  Why did they have to kill off the two coolest supporting characters first? The black woman and the larger white guy were knocked off before the obnoxious vet chick, who was by far the worst actress in a mainstream science/action flick since Saphron Burrows in Deep Blue Sea.8.  Why did all the murders have to be so gruesome and morally bankrupt, and shouldn't these bloody deaths have at least some emotional impact on the others? I've grown awfully weary of gratuitous bloodshed without purpose or consequence. They're your colleagues, and all you can do is look momentarily startled and move on? And what about all those caged animals that died fiery deaths in that explosion that the movie apparently forgot about? Awful.
9.  With a female as the film's lead character, shouldn't the producers have hired a director that sees woman as complex creatures instead of one that's a nasty misogynist (hence all the unnecessary boob shots here)? How about Kathryn Bigalow? Hell, Michael friggin' Bay would have been a better choice...10.  It's been said before, but: Can Hollywood PLEASE find someone other than James Cameron who can combine stunning computer effects and a script with a brain and a soul????????Enough. Is this just another example of Hollywood's constant condescension towards the moviegoing public? Or is this what Americans really want from movies? Could be; Hollow Man made more than twice as much at the box office than Almost Famous and Requiem For a Dream combined.  Shame on you, America! Don't we all want films that raise our spirits?  That provoke some kind of emotional response?

The acting was quite adequate, the film score very imaginative and the special effects amazing (and gruesome). It copies ""The Invisible Man"", made half a century before, in having its protagonist lose his mind but unlike the other film, there is no humor to be found - nor any reason for it. It is a bit too apocalyptic near the end and I felt that the special effects turned it perhaps too much into a technical spectacle, but it made sense in general and brought me more pleasure than I had expected.

165,Minus_The_Beer,"It's Hollow, Man.",5,2 September 2012,"They say everything's better with Bacon; however, in the case of ""Hollow Man"" that saying rings a bit, well, hollow. Kevin Bacon stars as an obsessed scientist on the verge of an earth-shattering breakthrough: it seems as though he has discovered the key to invisibility. After successfully turning himself invisible, he harasses and haunts his co-workers in their secluded underground lab. The crew, fed up with his shenanigans, seeks to find a cure but that only brings the monster out in him, turning things from bad to worse.Verhoeven's time-waster is heavy on special effects but light on characters and originality. Bacon chews the scenery as the arrogant scientist on the fritz, while co-stars Josh Brolin and Elisabeth Shue seem like they belong in a better film. Verhoeven does the best he can with an anemic script, but eventually the special effects take over and the film becomes a bloated b-flick with a budget. There are at least a few genuine thrills to be found, and the film carries such a mean-streak and perverted air about it that it at least never gets dull. Unfortunately, like many of the director's latter-day films, ""Hollow Man"" takes things a bit too far and the end result is a sloppy, botched experiment, much like Bacon's science project.While there are certainly worse sci-fi flicks to be found, ""Hollow Man"" is an example of great potential failing to live up to expectations. In this film, you have a solid cast and a director who knows how to entertain within the science-fiction and action realms. There are redeeming qualities to be found, but they are few and far between. For lack of a better term, ""Hollow Man"" is pretty hollow.",Hollow Man
166,Perception_de_Ambiguity,If you take 'Hollow Man' for what it is...,7,14 January 2009,"Sure, there was more that could have been made of the concept, rather than yet another cat and mouse action/horror film but it was genuinely exciting and decently plausible so I can't fault it for that. The effects are great, it isn't really concerned with Sci-Fi but those elements check out alright.I have theories why it wasn't well received at all. - the main character is highly unsympathetic, from start on (for most people, anyway) - the two main characters are divorced, which I think usually isn't a popular plot device, unless it is more than just a plot device and it is ABOUT this couple and their romanceI think it touches some interesting themes but doesn't explore them. Like, I would have been interested to see how the raped woman manages to live on after such an experience. And I would have liked to see some more original ways how the main character uses his invisibility in public. The main character's turn into a ""monster"" wasn't all that convincing. He had a lot to live for but he was ready to throw that all away for those powers. It could have worked, but the film doesn't offer a lot of psychological insight.Favourite piece of dialogue: Sarah: >Yes, Sir!< Sebastian: >How come when you say ""Yes, Sir"" it kinda sounds like ""F-ck you!""< Sarah: >Practice!<Favorite piece of trivia: ""This is the first Hollywood movie of Paul Verhoeven that got an R-rating in its first submission to the MPAA.

Hollow Man has brilliant special effects, but can't be bothered with making a plot worth watching and instead just becomes a standard horror movie.  Aren't there more interesting things a guy who's invisible could do?  I would hope so.The movie is so obvious.  It's clear what's going to happen, who will die, and how, from the start of the slasher elements.  There's little suspense, and you'll find yourself just yelling at the idiocy of the movie.  For example, in one scene Bacon's invisible man is covered in blood.  In the next, he's completely clean and invisible again.  In another movie the creators might have stopped to wonder just how exactly he showered his entire body (To remove blood, not an easy thing) so that he was invisible again.  But, nah, they just assumed the audience would be stupid enough not to notice.  And the final scene with the rising fire and the elevator...let's not even go into it.I cannot believe that $95 million was wasted on that film.  The effects were incredible, and almost worth seeing, if you don't have to pay.  It seems ridiculous to spend that much money on so very little.  Couldn't they have afforded at least a half of a script on that much money?The saddest part was on the night I watched this, I hated it to the point of screaming at the television, but it still wasn't the worst thing I saw that night (That honor belonged to the insanely bad Ladies Man).Avoid.",Hollow Man

Third, the deflection of his mental state of mind that turns him into a monster is shown to be a combination of being locked up like a lab rat and the process of being Phase shifted for so long.

171,japamo,"Invisibility: the ""Hollow"" Premise",5,21 September 2005,"A while ago I caught ""Hollow Man"" on cable. I entered at about the point Sebastian Crane (Kevin Bacon), now invisible, infiltrated the young female intern's apartment and started to unsettle her with his pranks. Based on the portion of the movie I just saw, ""Hollow Man"" is an implausible, but mechanically entertaining horror schlock fest with undeniably impeccable special effects. However, I believe it is not a truly efficient, provocative, or memorable movie. Why?Its premise, the power of invisibility, in and of itself, really ain't that great!H.G. Wells's own classic novel ""The Invisible Man"" meticulously spells out the numerous disadvantages of invisibility. The invisible protagonist himself considers himself a ""helpless absurdity"". Unless you also make your clothes invisible, which the protagonist actually could but didn't have time to do, your naked invisible body is more vulnerable to the elements and to disease. Other disadvantages the novel points out: 1) dust, soot, and rain will reveal your outline, 2) eaten meals will outline your invisible stomach until the food is digested. 3) animals such as dogs can still hear or smell your presence. In other words, an invisible person still possesses the flaws of an ordinary human being. Furthermore, ironically, an invisible person would be more conspicuous to the public than an ordinary person. That's because, as the novel points out, invisibility grants you the power to obtain things, but not enjoy them once you get them. Sure, you can rob a bank without being seen, but you can't get away with the money without being noticed.The above-mentioned disadvantages existed even in the novel's 19th century milieu. In modern times, invisibility is even more of a disadvantage. Motion detectors and heat-imaging sensors can detect even an invisible man's presence. Therefore, an invisible villain may get a few limited jollies at the outset, but will still be easily captured by sensible heroes.To its credit, ""Hollow Man"" recognizes some of invisibility's disadvantages. However, it artificially shifts the edge to Sebastian in order to even have a movie. Yes, the heroes have heat-sensing goggles, but the lab automatically becomes uniformly warm to hide Sebastian's temperature. Out in the real world, the naked Sebastian would be easily detected and apprehended, so the movie's action must remain in the claustrophobic lab. And, as others have mentioned, invisibility does not confer invulnerability (even if adrenalin surges can partially account for Sebastian's newfound resistance to pain). Finally of course, ""Idiot Plot"" components further the movie along.To conclude, invisibility has its (limited) uses and can supplement other abilities, but in its own right is not much to write home about. Why do you think Stan Lee fortified the Invisible Woman's invisibility powers with force-field projection?",Hollow Man
172,Animus,He's not as hollow as you think...,7,5 August 2000,"Okay I gave this movie an 8, the special effects were a 10, the story was a 6 (not complex, missed a couple good tricks with invisibility, quick quasi-science explanation on invisibility) The acting was 8 for most of the main characters (Bacon does a real good job of descending into madness). The few twists were subtle and I have my doubts that more than half the theater figured out why the formula to make him visible failed to work even after the ending.

I won't belabor all of the inane mistakes made by the filmmakers; you'll have to read the Goofs page for most of them.""Hollow Man"" is a great description of the men who created this dreck and stuck it up on cinema walls.  The movie starts off formulaic but interesting; it seems nothing intrigues like the idea of invisibility.  What would you do if you could make yourself completely invisible?  Apparently, the creators of this film would ogle women, fondle women, rape women, and then kill women.  Coming from Paul Verhoeven (Showgirls, Basic Instinct), this is starting to look like a pattern to me.  Any unsolved sexual attacks in Verhoeven's neighborhood lately?The last half of this movie then descends into bad acting, bad writing, and very bad science.  Besides what you see on the goofs page, here's a few highlights:* After locking everyone into a freezer, Cane turns the temperature all the way down, and the temperature drops about thirty degrees in three or four seconds.  WRONG!* In said locker, Shue dithers around for a while, then makes an electromagnet out of a cardiac crash cart _while frost is forming everywhere_!  Can we say, ""SHOCK!!""* After implausibly (at best) freeing herself and her boyfriend from the locker, and being surrounded by her dead friends, Shue leaps through the door into a pool of blood with an extremely perky and completely inappropriate grin on her face.  ""Look at me -- I'm a scientist!"" Definitely one of the humor highlights of the film.* The boyfriend has the hook end of a crowbar buried into his stomach, but is able to survive when perky scientist Shue duct-tapes the wound closed. (How's that for your typical male fantasy?  A sexy girlfriend with a genius IQ who likes duct tape.  If only she had brought the beer.)  A few minutes later, the boyfriend is able to hang from a ladder and pull Shue up to him with this tremendous tear in his abdominal muscles.* Shue sets a fire under one sprinkler head and all of them open up and spew water all over a metal floor.  Sprinkler heads are individually activated. This would only set ONE head off.

This flick was thoroughly saturated with cliches and felt as though it had been written by a couple of incompetent 13-year old school boys! WARNING! HOLLOW SPOILERS! WARNING!1. Female characters are there only to be molested or raped. That would be because they're 'pretty' and they 'deserve it' (mentality of the Director).
2. Being invisible encourages you to do the most important thing that occupies your mind 99% of the time: molest, assault or kill women.3. Its O.K. to use gorillas in scientific experiments. They're not endangered anyway. If your a dog and your invisible, you don't go mad even though you've been invisible longer. Humans, however, go insane within days. 4. If your invisible, you have incredible strength and you can't die.
5. All female scientists wear revealing tight sweaters and tight jeans.6. When the elevator hurtles up the lift shaft like a runaway express train and it hits you, you live!

176,Lando_Hass,"An overall good movie, despite the fact that it is very insipid...",7,31 October 2002,"Hollow Man, is about a scientist named Sebastian Caine. Sebastian Caine is a normal workaholic, and he is currently working on an serum that can reverse the formula that makes thing invisible. He cracks the code for the serum, specifying that it is stable. When he goes to work the next day, him and his co-workers test the serum on an already invisible gorilla. They turn the gorilla visible again, and the product is ready to be sold. However, Sebastian doesn't want to sell the medicines until it is properly tested on a human being. Sebastian Caine agrees to test the serum on himself. When he turns invisible, he is confident that the he can become visible again. When his co-workers inject the serum into Sebastian, it turns out to be not quite a success. Sebastian is now invisible, and he cannot turn visible anymore, that is until they find a cure. Over time, Sebastian starts to lose his mind. He escapes from the lab, and his fantasies become reality. He eventually becomes a mad killer. Hollow Man isn't much of an original movie, but it does have some strong points. Hollow Man has some strong points, but some of the actors aren't some of its strong points. Take Josh Brolin for example. His character is Matt Kensington, and in one part of the movie, he is trying to break the code for the antidote. When he fails, he just makes a frustrated grunt sound, while a marker is in his mouth. Josh Brolin gave a great performance in ""The Goonies"", but in here, he didn't quite use all of his acting talent. Another bad actor in this movie is Greg Grunberg (he plays as Carter Abbey). I haven't seen any of his other movies, but in Hollow Man, he gives a BAD performance. Another problem with Hollow Man, is that it is VERY predictable, and very insipid. All the characters have absolutely no personality whatsoever. The only character in this movie that at least has some personality is Sebastian Caine. Another bad problem, is that you CANNOT watch it more than once, and that the movie itself is plagued with horrible lines. Now I'll give some of the strong points. The CG, is of course great. There is a few pairs of boobies, and there is a respectable amount of blood featured in the film. Overall, Hollow Man is a good movie, despite a lack of good acting, and clever characters.

There are stupendous special-effects, a paperthin plot and some cliffhangers and - voilá: ""Hollow man"". None of these actors manage to convince as scientists, but who cares. They do what they are supposed to do in this kind of movie: act stupid/heroic and die (well, at least some of them). And when people die in a Verhoeven-film they don't go quietly! No, they die in every imaginable way, the nastier the better, and that is just what I expect. And at certain intervals there is a dose of sex with or without exciting action sequences.

The invisible man is visible while draped in rain, wrapped in smoke, or immeresed in water.  (POSSIBLE SPOILER) In the most memorable scene from the film, a gorilla is scene disappear and reappear, right down the pumping organs and veins. The multi-million dollar special effects are definitely in top form here, so why on Earth couldn't a few more dollars have been spent trying to write a better script?Hollow Man lives up to its name in two ways: Kevin Bacon's character is hollow, and so is the plot: a tacked-on affair, invisible-man-goes-insane, and paper-thin characters. ""Let's crank up the visuals and f*** the story"" seems to be the general consensus of the film, and it does not click at all.The first half of the film is well-done, showing the basic invisibility premise and Bacon's initial reaction.  The second half, however, somehow turns into your standard slasher picture, with Bacon hunting down each member of his team in a small, enclosed place.  The gore is not the problem at all; in fact, the most disturbing scene is a dog smashed against a cage violently.  But the story - what's that, you say? Friday the 13th? Sleepaway Camp?  That's right; the story is right along with that drek. 
And just as is the fashion of such slasher flicks, the killer is damn-near invincible - Bacon is and beat up, burned, electrocuted, and cracked on the head with a crowbar,yet gets up in a matter of minutes, rarin' to go. What on Earth is going on here? Did the invisibility serum also make him a not only a hollow man, but also a superman?If you don't mind a storyline reminiscient of such horror fodder, then you'll no doubt love seeing Kevin Bacon killing all in his path.

He has already succeeded on animal trials and is ready to go to the next step, human testing, Cane volunteers to be the first human subject. The experiment seems like a major success, until something goes terrible goes wrong. Now Sebastian is becoming increasingly paranoid and out of control, doomed to be without flesh for all his life. Now his team wants to shut the project down and bring in the government to catch Sebastian, But Sebastian traps them in the lab with him. With time running out can the team really out smart a maniac invisible man? Hollow man is not a great movie in the sense of what it is, it is a great achievement in visual effects and putting a whole new story to the invisible man tale. It also makes you wonder if that feeling you get when your alone is really just a feeling, or if it's just your imagination playing tricks on you.",Hollow Man
186,JohnnyPHreak,This Sci-Fi thriller can be summed up with two words: Eye Candy,6,4 August 2000,"Paul Verhoeven, the man behind Starship Troopers, Total Recall and Basic Instinct has brought another movie filled with eye candy. Hollow Man is the story of a scientist Sebastian Caine  (Kevin Bacon) who has found the ability to make animals invisible. He and his team (which features Josh Brolin, Kim Dickens and Elisabeth Shue among others) are the best in their field and they work in a secure government facility. When Caine figures out a way to bring an invisible gorilla back he is very ready to test this on a human, mainly himself. But when things go wrong and he can't be brought back, Caine loses his senses and becomes drunk with power. That's when chaos breaks loose. Verhoeven famous for FX shots and eye candy doesn't disappoint. The CGI in this film is incredible. They do so much to show the FX off here it's great. You could just go to the film for that. The transformation scenes will blow your mind. Bacon is perfectly cast. He just as psychotic as he is cool. He also has some of the best lines in the film. I'm not a big fan of Elisabeth Shue. She looks good but could she pull off the tough scientist (unlike The Saint). She was great. When she got a job to do she gets it done. When she needs to kick some butt she gets it done. She was a fun complement to Bacon's Caine. The other performances were done to the best of their ability but only Bacon and Shue stud out. Now on to what this film was basic made for the eye candy. There is lots of it here. The violence is bloody and there is much nudity. Lots of gruesome  deaths and lots of flesh. This film also does a good job at getting you to jump. There are many horror jump moments that might just have you out of your seat. Hollow Man is a great Sci-Fi thriller with loads of eye candy. It's a must see. Have fun.",Hollow Man

But it was clear that Verhoeven got bored with that notion after about, oh ten minutes... So what then, well this is a Verhoeven film - bring on the sex and gore. That's right, the film becomes just another run of the mill ""stalk & slash"" thriller, there's nothing here that you haven't seen in any a Halloween movie. With the exception of the special f/x of course.Come on, this was supposed to be the Invisible man for the new millennium, I wanted to see Bacon's life disintegrating, I wanted to see him twisted with rage by the fact that he'd left his life behind. This film had the room to say so much, but instead abandoned all the questions and opts for the quick buck.This is basically an average thriller with some groundbreaking effects (the only reason I bought the DVD was for the behind the scenes stuff), some OK acting (mainly from Bacon but then again he's hardly in it) and enough explosions to keep the `kids' happy. Watch it, but much like the title suggest, it may leave you feeling a little hollow.

188,crowrobot,"Unoriginal script and idea, but a highly entertaining ride nonetheless...",10,14 June 2005,"With 'Hollow Man', Kevin Bacon has come full circle. An actor who has made a career out of being nice guys, Bacon finally gets to sink his teeth into Paul Verhoeven's latest gorefest. It's an unoriginal, uninspired movie, but the awesome special effects and Bacon's menacing performance help make it into a deliriously entertaining popcorn thriller.Bacon plays Sebastian Caine, a scientist whose team includes Elisabeth Shue and Josh Brolin. They're working on an invisibility serum, and when Sebastian injects himself with it, the results are terrifying. Soon after the shock has set in, the team learns that the antidote serum won't work. Sebastian gets desperate until finally, he discovers just how cool being an invisible man can be. The rest of the movie involves Sebastian turning into a loonytoon madman, raping his neighbor (it's implied, unfortunately) and killing off his team members one by one. Can he be stopped?The second half of this film is plagued with the usual flaw of horror movies: Characters doing extremely stupid things that make you want to scream at them, ""You *idiot*! Don't go in there!"" But they're done here with a visual flair and lots and lots of blood. The invisibility special effects are simply AWESOME. Director Verhoeven is apparently good at this sort of movie (this is the first movie by him I've seen), and I think Hollywood should forgive him for the legendary stinker 'Showgirls' (although I haven't seen that film, I've heard it sucks big-time).All the acting is OK, save for Bacon: His fearsome performance is what holds the movie together. Elisabeth Shue, coming off her Oscar-nominated turn in 'Leaving Las Vegas', does a good job, although most of her role consists of yelling. Josh Brolin is okay, and so are the other soon-to-be-doomed characters. There's one moment where, being a long-time ducktape user, I laughed: Shue uses ducktape to stop Brolin from bleeding. That should tell you that this movie is unconcerned with reality. But that's okay. This movie is really, really cool and I highly recommend it.",Hollow Man
189,VikiLauda,Paul Verhoeven CLASS!,7,14 March 2021,"Ever since I first fell in love with the original RoboCop I have been a terrific fan of Paul Verhoeven's work. My main passion in film is scifi/horror so naturally I really enoyed this movie when I first saw it 20 years ago, & even today it holds well & does not look dated. Hollow Man has some absolutely awesome special effects which makes forgiving the mediocre acting & character development, easy. & while I don't think this film is scarey, it does deliver some chills & will even satisfy slasher fans. But be warned. This movie is certainly not for children, or those sensitive to gore, & ardent animal lovers like myself will he disquieted & could be upset by some scenes. There are also scenes of sexual abuse, which today's young feminists would be horrified at, BUT....This is a fantasy movie, & if, like me, you really appreciate the hard work, imagination & artistry that goes into making wonderful scifi/horror, you will enjoy Hollow Man!It tells the story about a group of scientists who are developing a serum that can turn living things invisable & then revert them to visable again which they achieve with a gorilla named Isobell. When her reversion is an apparent success the lead scientist decides he will try it on himself, without clearing the experiment with the authorities. He achieves invisability, but when the rest of the team try to revert him, it is unsuccessful & the invisable scientist begins to loose his mind & goes on a deadly rampage...The direction is good, even if the acting is averege, but the special effects are really what makes this film shine. Even today's CGI is rather poor when compared to Hollow Man. The story runs along nicely too, with just the right pace. As I said above it is not really scarey but it is a good psychological thriller with some slasher elements which is a fun ride. This is certaily an age 17+ with lots of adult themes including bad language & with both male & female nudity. It also features experiments on animals & animal cruelty in one scene. I am a big animal lover & even I look away sometimes, so this movie has to be viewed with eyes that recognise fantasy from reality, & just enjoyed as a solid piece of fantasy entertainment.

The idea is he should remain in the laboratory until the effect has worn off but he decides to take a trip outside.Which is the start of the trouble.

But by the second half of the two hour film it turned into your dull, predictable, standard hollywood horror film. I found the elevator scene at the end to be extremely annoying. A typical hollywood scene designed to make one tense only ended up in making me annoyed as the cliched scene tried to bring exitement and action to the end of the film. I found it to be laughable.I will rate this movie a 4. Based on the IMD rating scale this movie falls below the minimum 7 rating, that in my opinion, makes a movie worth seeing.skip it!",Hollow Man
201,johanleupen,"Intriguing premise, falls flat in the last half hour.",7,2 September 2000,"Verhoeven's satiric view of american society is less prominent or absent even, from his latest outing. Instead, we get a reasonably exciting, sfx-laden thriller. The CGI-scenes are absolutely fabulous. There are some effective moments, when the public isn't sure whether Sebastian is present or not. The stalker scene was also very on-point. (Unfortunately it was the censored cut eventhough i saw the dutch print, which was supposed to be uncut.) It was never extremely shocking, which i found was dissapointing since i have always liked Verhoeven's edgy style (which Hollow Man lacked somewhat). All is well though until the final 30 minutes of the film, during which it turns from an effective thriller into a brainless overly bombastic climax which is really too bad. It's a shame Verhoeven was tempted by the crowd-pleasing explosions and one-liners in the end.",Hollow Man
202,dima-12,Unfortunately crippled masterpiece,10,26 August 2000,"Paul Verhoeven belongs to the group of Hollywood authors that try hard to widen the expectations and criteria of the audience.Sadly,the industry isn`t always ready to support such intentions.The movies became too expensive and studios do a lot of formulaic pics just to be sure that they`ll get their money back.Verhoeven managed to avoid such studio limitations in his movies.Maybe because Hollywood owes so much to the `Crazy Dutch`? Verhoeven defined the legacy of the modern Hollywood.With `RoboCop` he made the ultimate action SF comic-book cross-over that has a large ammount of satire.`Total Recall` turned the action SF mould into a new shape e.g. plotty scripts with twists were the written backing for energetic visceral action.Check `Total Recall` once again these days- look how Verhoeven made it,dig how he shot Scwarzenegger,try to imagine seeing such a movie today (in the year 2000)...They simply don`t make movies like that anymore.`Basic Instinct` shaped the form of the postmodern erotic thriller.This genre has the greatest representative in this movie.The picture turned this genre into a potent moneymaking well for the studios.At the same time `Basic Instinct` launched Sharon Stone into stardom that was exclusively built on this Verhoven pic (remember that Sharon failed to repeat such commercial or pop-cultural success afterwards). With `Starship Troopers` Verhoeven ventured into the deeply intellectual vein of his Hollywood career.This movie was an explicit satire of the American civilisation.Verhoeven`s stylish direction made it look like a straight `gung ho`war movie but there were layers of subversion beneath.Even Ed Neumeier`s script failed to remain straight faced all the way-it went spoofy toward the climax.This movie flopped on the box-office but it also developed a strong fandom.Unfortunately most of the fans liked the pic because of Verhoeven`s energetic staging of battles.Only a minority understood how important and perverse was a movie where TV actors in Nazi uniforms blow bugs away. `Hollow Man` followed.It was released in a season when De Palma,Woo and Zemeckis made weak films.Movie buffs around the world wandered if one great era was drawing to a close.But then `Hollow Man` hit the screens. In `Hollow Man` Verhoeven is as vital as ever.This time he tackles the myth of the Invisible Man(that was initially invented by H.G.Wells). This mythology is great since it provides the author with limitless opportunities.It also easily uncovers author`s obsessions (I mean Wes Craven`s Invisible Man would be different from Sam Mendes`).This review will be full of spoilers but you are already familiar with the most of those plotlines and this movie is so great that you should see it neverminding the knowledge about the story. In Verhoeven`s `Hollow Man` the invisible guy is the monster.So if you take a simple look into the movie you can define it as the monster pic. The monster is opposed to heroes.The only Verhoeven`s touch is that monster isn`t too bad and heroes ain`t no good. The monster is scientist Sebastian Caine (Kevin Bacon),a pure genius that invented invisibility serum.Heroes are his ex-girlfriend Linda and his friend Matt (who is also Linda`s current lover) who are also scientists (but underachievers compared to Sebastian).Sebastian is sexually frustrated but not in the sense of not getting any.He simply isn`t getting what he deserves (Sebastian is a much better guy than his ex-lover`s present boyfriend) so audience emphatizes with him.When he goes invisible he a)solves his sexual frustration (being in peace with your sexual instinct is extremely important said late Sigmund Freud) b)fights for his life and for `what he is` e.g.he kills officials and colleagues that try to eliminate him.While performing this he sins but overall he just tries to scratch his itches.Actually the pic is set as a fight between classy,decadent intellectual (Hollow Man) and his dumber friends that have a chance to obey in `melting pot` America. The described setting of `the monster` that isn`t so bad and the mentally inferior heroes seems kinky for some 80-million summer movies. Verhoeven turns this picture into a landmark when he deploys all the idiomatic solutions of dialogue in the script.For example,the typical `come fight me like a man`line get a new flavour when it is being said by a mediocre person that covers the shallowness with dogmatic justice. Why would classy scientist like Caine accept this dumb challenge? I am not saying that this line doesn`t work.It is actually great but Verhoeven changes its tone by twisting the character set-up.When John McClane says that in `Die Hard` it is the symbol of the true American valor.In `Hollow Man` it is the symbol of a dumb guy trying to out-muscle the genius. Verhoeven also uncovers the Hollywood manipulation with Christianity. Like in every monster movie heroes here whine about Godless nature of science.Most of these accusations are true but in `Hollow Man` heroes use this to simply cover their inabilty to think and invent like Caine.Most of the Godless nature of science in movies is connected to the cabalist myth of Golem. With this character manipulation Verhoeven aims the foundings of America-the movies.Let`s be real-people around the world see America only through movies.I can bet that most young and literate people around the globe know more about New York than about any town in their own fatherland.Well,this time Verhoeven messed with the powerful and influential institution of the Hollywood Movie.He showed how a talented and smart author can reinvent cliches. `Hollow Man` script floated the Web for a long time.It was written by Andrew W.Marlowe (Air Force One,End of Days)and based on a story by Scott E.Anderson.Anyone who read the script sees that the studio and the MPAA messed with the picture.Even one early AICN review showed that the first 150-minute cut packed more punch than any recent release (the movie is 114 minutes long). Apparently MPAA have left out the kinky and explicit parts while studio retooled the movie by re-editing it in order to make Caine a pure but `by the numbers` villain.Thus they jeopardized the integrity of Verhoeven`s vision. Author`s direction is as stylish as ever.Verhoeven makes every smart viewer feel like a kid in the candy store and the use of CGI really creates the sense of awe and wonder. Kevin Bacon did a great job.His role was a tough one since he isn`t visible for the most of the time.That`s why he had to achieve the illusion and expression only with his voice.Elizabeth Shue and Josh Brolin are great as an annoying couple of dogmatic underachievers that bond through averageness.If you look for hero quality in their roles you`re off the mark. `Hollow Man` has flaws that are imposed by the studio and the MPAA.But if I don`t claim it to be a masterpiece I would betray the joy I felt watching it.",Hollow Man

The ONLY way to see this beasts coming at you is with the infra-red goggles scattered all over the premises.  But do these ""geniuses"" even put them on?  No, that would be too much trouble.  That's one of dozens of flaws in this idiotic story.  Most of the rest are related to the fact that an extremely advanced scientific project is explained about as well as a ""Jeckyl & Hyde"" episode of Bugs Bunny.

205,HBeachBabe,What would it look like if an invisible guy....,5,7 August 2000,"I went to this with several things in mind before the opening titles rolled: 1) It's a mindless, summer action movie 2) The special effects will be mind boggling 3) Once great director Paul Verhoeven (Soldier of Orange, 4th Man, Robocop) has become a Hollywood hack (Total Recall, Showgirls, Starship Troopers).Know these 3 things going in, I was able to enjoy the movie for what it was- a mindless summer action film with great effects made by a hack director who long ago sold out.  I guess if you lower your expectations enough, you can enjoy anything.As expected, the effects are stunning!  Watch carefully during the CPR scene and note that Josh Brolins hands are actually above the visible internal organs, and in fact are where the (invisible) skin would be.I won't comment on the overly cliched, one-more-scare, one more ""resurrection"" ending as everyone else already seems to have rightfully trashed that part of the film.  What I found most disappointing was the claustrophobic nature of the film- with rare exception, the entire film takes place in an underground lab, despite the fact that while invisible, Sebastian Caine (Kevin Bacon) could go anywhere and never be found, yet he keeps returning to the confines of the lab.Yes you see Kevin's butt which I have no problem with although it still doesn't make up for the unnecessary female nudity (did I really need to see Kim Dickens be given an invisible mauling on what was obviously a digitally superposed fake breast?)  There was much laughter in the packed theater however when Kevin's skinless member was seen as well as when it is shown in the thermal camera shots.To the films credit, they don't try to explain the invisibility process beyond some vague mention of ""quantum phase shift"" since the how's of invisibility are irrelevant to the story - just that an insane guy is invisible.And as a final trivia note, William Devane has a bit role here as well as a larger role in Space Cowboys, released on the same day - a trick I haven't seen since Brent Spiner showed up in both Independence Day and Phenomenon",Hollow Man

The almost Oscar-winning SFX elevated the crime scenes over typical killer movie fare but not enough to dispel the sour mood that 1 killing had put me in, though I rallied somewhatwhen the scientists' ranks started diminishing; a less likeable ensemble exists only in the annals of ""reality"" tv as in Jersey/Floribama Shore, (S)uck Dynasty, Survivor/Big Brother.

207,watto124,...........whoa.....and....uh...cool...and kinda could've been better....,8,9 August 2000,"Hollow Man contains the best special effects I have ever seen in a motion picture. And thats not very surprising due to the current technology used for entertaining movie-goers around the globe. The story is above-average and the acting is great considering the plot situations (an INVISIBLE MAN!?). Kevin Bacon is once again a great nasty. His last great portrayal of a villain was the pretty cool River Wild in 94'. Paul Verhoeven shows us his great sci-fi talent again after the dissapointing Starship Troopers. The film is everything I expected it to be....fantastic, up until the end. He tries to murder every one of his fellow scientists. Which is an appropriate and cool plot-twist but they could have done it much, much better. If they had done it the way the Alien films did with a slow chase start and not much action it would have been better. Whats there at the climax is entertaining, but I was left wanting much more.

209,tallguy62,Starts out good -- but deteriorates quickly into a stupid slasher,1,29 November 2007,"In general, Kevin Bacon and Elizabeth Shue are both enjoyable in films. This movie starts out very interestingly with a real scientific plot and premise. The storyline had so much promise -- why did the filmmakers ""pull the rug out from under the viewers"" and turn it into a blood and guts horror-fest? The trailers to the film did not indicate it would be a horror movie. If I had known it was, I would have skipped it completely.One aspect of horror movies like this is that the victims are always helpless and never really fight back. It is always a lot more fun if the victims are more interesting than the murderer. Unfortunately, this movie adds nothing to an already trite, clichéd and tired genre.

Girl throws blood on floor (good idea to see footprints) but then she doesn't do it 360 degrees and then she turns her back to it (why?) Then low and behold gets killed.3. Shues boyfriend (sorry don't know characters as was bored) was hit hard with crow bar, bleeding heavy and passing out (not before Shue is locked in a freezer getting drastically frozen, but instead of finding a way out she is sticking gaffa on his ribcage to stop the blood.

Yep, so whilst being near to death due to the cold she somehow fathoms up a complex magnet to get her out. Woo hoo and succeeds yayyy.5.

He suffers I would say 80% burns but takes his clothes off and voilaaaa he had made a full recovery. Hmm ok.7. Now at this point the boyfriend comes back to save Shue (he only has gaffa on a very deep cut) and wow he is back to full strength. Wow wow wow. Guess what he strikes Kevin bacon and leaves him as (we got to get back to the lab). Instead of finishing him off there let's inspect the lab...8. Lab goes up in flames Bacon SHOULD be dead right? Noo he manages to chase them up the lift chute. The flames are getting higher (hang on it was all sulphuric acid so shouldn't the be dead literally due to the fumes)? Hell no. Boyfriend fully recovered and bacon falling to his death. But wait, the lift stops just before their heads. Wow such an amazing act of chance.

213,nealklein,More Verhoeven,4,5 December 2002,"After watching this movie, all I could think was that Paul Verhoeven had packaged himself into a predictable product, in the same vein as ""Starship Troopers"". If you compare ""Flesh + Blood"" and ""Total Recall"" and especially ""RoboCop"" to this thoughtless waste of time, you would see how far down the Hollywood road (paved with uncreative intentions) the director has trod.
Paul Verhoeven films are ridiculously over the top when it comes to sex and violence. What makes his better films memorable is the intelligence behind those moments of ridiculous, overdone effect. Now add to that clever background detail and you get Verhoeven pre-""Starship Troopers"". Hey, even ""Starship Troopers"" had some intelligence in it compared to this excrement.""Hollow Man"" tries so hard to offend and aggravate that it doesn't achieve anything beyond diminishing itself. I guess Paul was trying to be clever again, but what he makes is a story that people can only realistically watch once, if *that* many times. The special effects are truly well done, and the premise is intriguing, which is why I do not vote this one into the MST3K category, but beyond that, the principal actors and string-pullers in this mess should pretend ""Hollow Man"" never happened.",Hollow Man
214,nuhc,Special effects do not a great movie make,2,14 April 2008,"I guess that summary says it all. You can have all the greatest special effects in the world, but if you have a poor script, the movie will suck. And that's what happened with Hollow Man. The CGI was good, unfortunately the movie also contains the usual Hollywood cliché of overly large, too-big explosions. Sorry, but I'm not impressed with the size of explosions in a movie. Give me a good story line.Another problem with this movie is that with the exceptions of a few scenes, the entire story takes place deep underground at a secret government lab. I guess they spent so much on CGI that they didn't have enough left over to build many different sets. But the movie would have been better had the main character, while invisible, investigate what it was like to be invisible in a large city. But of this we only got a couple scenes.What could have been an interesting view into what it would really be like to be invisible turns into a B slasher movie plot. And that, I think, is the real shortcoming of this movie.

Mostly used special effects doesn't do much contribution to the movie that it should have.It's also a curiously timid and unadventurous movie that doesn't even try to challenge its audience and seems a particular disappointment coming from a director whose other failures (""Showgirls,"" ""Starship Troopers"") have tended to be epic, outlandish and daring.Kevin Bacon plays arrogant scientist Sebastian Caine, who is transformed after testing a top-secret, irreversible serum on himself. When the return serum fails, he finds himself trapped in the state, gradually goes insane and turns into a serial killer.Overall, invisibility effects were cool, but after Sebastian's transformation, there's nothing but dawdling around until he finally goes insane. ** out of *****",Hollow Man
216,LDB_Movies,Trust those IMDb User Ratings!!!,5,12 September 2000,"I decided that even though ""Hollow Man"" had a pretty bad 5.5 user rating at the time, it still looked good in the trailers and I decided to see it. BAD DECISION! Trust those IMDb User Ratings! That's what they're here for! I won't make that mistake again!Anyway, this is probably one of the worst and certainly THE most disappointing movie of the year 2000 so far. I can only add to the lists of bad things already covered by other viewers. 1. I could tell from the VERY FIRST SCENE that the movie was going to be BAD. That's not a good sign. It's a bad one.2. No one smiles that much at work - even if you are a great scientist on the verge of making someone or something invisible, you don't smile the way the entire cast was smiling in the opening scenes - no matter how much you love your job.3. The acting all around was horrible, except possibly for the woman who played the vet - she at least was partially believable. I haven't seen much of Elizabeth Shue but she was terrible in a role that Sharon Stone could have eaten for breakfast. I kept wishing that Sharon Stone would appear and takeover the role mid-movie.4. Kevin Bacon is not exactly Laurence Olivier, but he wasn't much better here. Luckily he becomes hollow soon enough and we don't have to look at him anymore. And by the way, the audience I was with laughed hysterically everytime they showed his you-know-what.5. The morals of this movie are questionable at best - I am not a prude and hardly ever complain about bad messages being sent by movies - but nary a comment about experimenting on animals, and nary a comment about molesting unsuspecting women while you are invisible. I guess the moviemakers assumed that we all know both those things are wrong, correct?6. The movie suspends disbelief one or two or three too many times. ** SPOILER ALERT ** There is no way that Elizabeth's Shue's character could have recovered so quickly from a blow to the head like the one she took in the final reel. Not to mention Josh Brolin's cliched recovery afterwards.7. Cliches abound in this movie - ** SPOILER ALERT ** - Check out Roger Ebert's book on movie cliches - you will find the following which also appear in ""Hollow Man"" - the black character is the first one killed - the hero/heroine have a chance to kill the bad guy, or at least make sure he's dead, but they don't and they walk away from him with their backs turned, and of course he gets up and attacks them again.",Hollow Man

218,derekauthor,Not a 'Hollow' Thriller,9,26 August 2005,"""Hollow Man"" is about an arrogant but brilliant scientist (Kevin Bacon) who leads a team of other scientists (including former girlfriend Elisabeth Shue and her new flame, Josh Brolin) on a quest to develop a serum that can make people invisible. When Bacon becomes invisible, however, chaos ensues.The film was a lot of fun, with excellent special effects and a thrilling ending. The concept that ""Do you REALLY think you're along?"" works very well here, and is emphasized in many scenes. When he was interviewed, screenwriter Andrew W. Marlowe said that he wanted to go more for the psychology of it. It just doesn't work as a sci-if/action thriller, it also has some psychological thriller overtones.Even though it gets increasingly bloody as it goes along, ""Hollow Man"" still manages to deliver the goods. The film also stars Kim Dickens, Greg Grunberg, Joey Slotnick, and Mary Randle as the scientists, and William Devane as their boss. It was directed by Dutch director Paul Verhoeven (Total Recall, Robocop).If you like science fiction, action, and even psychological thrillers, ""Hollow Man"" is for you.

While not an all-out debacle like Showgirls, he's done better work.  The transformation scenes are pretty cool, I think this may be one of those movies that has one or two really cool scenes that you wish belonged to a better movie.  The concept of the movie is a somewhat interesting one, but the script is too full of holes for it to work.  The science fiction aspect of the movie is pretty flimsy, and it has none of the element of satire that made Robocop and Starship Troopers work.  It degenerates into a bad slasher movie/Alien clone in the second half.  I never knew cutting-edge researchers could be such idiots! ""He's our good friend!  He certainly wouldn't take advantage of his invisibility to conduct a phantom reign of invisible terror!  Not remotely possible!""  I don't see why Ed Neumeier couldn't have been brought in for the script, I was really hoping for a ""ED-209 moment"" (a scene where a new weapon/piece of technology malfunctions and kills someone gruesomely) in this movie, but was disappointed.

The man who has brought us such diverse classics as Total Recall, Basic Instinct and Showgirls, delivers to us Hollow Man, a strange mixture of the three.Sebastian Caine (Kevin Bacon) and his team of scientists have discovered the secret of invisibility.  The movie looks like it is over before it has begun!  But no, the problem they have is not making someone invisible, but getting them back to normal afterwards.After finally bringing an ape back to normal using the new formula devised by Caine, he pushes the project to Phase 3; tests on human beings.  He volunteers himself for the process, and that is where the fun begins.You see, the new formula to bring him back doesn't appear to work, so the team has to come up with something new.But they don't get much time to do so, cause the invisibility caper is affecting Kane's mind somewhat.  He starts off by just having some fun with his newfound invisibility, getting a closer look at the sexy neighbour he has always had his eye on, and playing with the minds of the scientific team just a bit.But apparently invisibility unhinges the mind a little, and he gets a bit more energetic with his activities...Hollow Man is a competent, if medically gruesome tale that keeps the attention for its 100 minute length.  I said it was a curious mixture of previous Paul Verhoeven films, and it is.  It has the suspense of Total Recall, the voyerism of Showgirls and the tension of Basic Instinct.The supporting cast on the whole is quite competent, Josh Brolin is fine, and Elisabeth Shue is OK as the the scientific team supporting Kevin Bacon.The all pervasive score by Jerry Goldsmith however is a hinderence to enjoying the film.The main talking point of the film, the special effects, are very well realised.  It was very hard to pick a fault with the numerous invisibility shots.  My only complaint was that there were too many of them, too many contrived situations created to show off the talents of the special effects team.Hollow Man was however, good solid entertainment and well worth a look.8 ouf of 10.",Hollow Man

Most science fiction fare of today isn't that good, however while watching, I found myself sitting on the edge of my seat wondering what was going to happen next.  I began thinking that it is about time for a good sci-fi film with so much suspense.  My heart was racing and my brain was running amok with every frame of this film.  I don't know why most people didn't like this movie that much since the acting is good, the script is brilliant, the special effects are great, film editing is outstanding, and you have to admit that the cinematography is beautiful--look at the vivid colors all throughout the film!

226,mhajs,"Verhoeven follow-up to S. Troopers isn't worse, but is still a failure attempt.",5,20 March 2006,"**After watching two Paul Verhoeven movies in a row in two days (Starship Troopers and Hollow Man), I'd like to report something: I'm sad. Paul Verhoeven is simply an unique director. In my opinion, one of the most gifted and talented science fiction directors of all times, a man who uses violence so artificially, that you believe even more on the craziness of the whole thing concerning a motion picture of his. After the big let-down that was Starship Troopers, I decided to rent and watch Hollow Man. What a waste.The story is about a crew of scientists who are working on an experiment concerning the ability of making animals invisible. The complex has tons of laboratories with cages all the way to the end of a corridor, where they lock invisible animals, like dogs, monkeys, etc. When an experiment of making a gorilla invisible and then bringing it back to visible succeeds, we find the key to the madness in this movie. Kevin Bacon, the leader scientist in the project decides to test the serum in himself in order to change into a hollow man.That's when the movie falls into an abyss. The rest of the crew, including Elizabeth Shue and Josh Brolin, after making the Kevin Bacon experiment a success, can't find a cure to make him visible again. Having the opportunity to create an amazing plot, where they would eventually find a cure and make this movie a much more intelligent motion picture, Hollow Man does the opposite. They can't find a cure perhaps because of the complex human DNA. Obviously the character of Kevin Bacon which besides his huge ambition, is a lovely character, goes mad and starts killing everyone.What should be an intelligent suspense, became just a mindless bloody body count feature with no better premise after it self destructs. I'm hoping after all these years, Paul Verhoeven, which is a director I admire a lot, will come up with something better.",Hollow Man
227,Oblomov_81,"Predictable, tedious mess",4,17 August 2000,"Yes, Paul Verhoeven is a master at creating special effects. And yes, the visuals to his films often add a good punch where it is needed. Unfortunately, he does not work well with those non-digital images on the screen that are called ""actors"" and ""characters.""The story to ""Hollow Man"" is pretty routine. A group of government-funded scientists have created a way to make living things invisible (for whatever reason is vague). They give the treatment to one of their own. He goes nuts. Etc. There are only two action sequences that take place outside the lab-- one is a sexual assault that is never referred to again for the rest of the film (evidence of heavy post-production cutting here), and the murder of a character who we could see was going to die from the moment he stepped onto the screen. The story is so weak that it just grows tedious after awhile. Even the Superman/Wonder Woman/Invisible Man joke was old.But the characters in the film are even more tiresome. They run around the lab acting like the cast from ""Friends,"" spurting out cute Gen-X dialogue and casually discussing their sex lives. There is not a single moment in the entire movie where I was convinced that the Pentagon would actually hire these ""professionals"" to work on a top-secret experiment. Elizabeth Shue (who deservedly got billing above Kevin Bacon, who brings no life to the Invisible Man role) and Josh Brolin scamper around like a football player and a cheerleader trying not to get caught behind the bleachers. The rest of the cast has ""expendable"" stamped all over their faces, and the only real suspense comes from guessing who gets offed next.To sum it up, ""Hollow Man"" is a hollow mess (like THAT'S not a cliche already).",Hollow Man
228,Shecky J. O'Pootertoot,"It's good, it just isn't scary",8,12 August 2000,"Hollow Man is a ride, baby. It isn't scary as the ads would have you believe, but I'll be dammed if it isn't one of the most entertaining horror flicks I've seen in a while. In this age of computer generated, digital effects I have a hard time telling good special effects from bad (they all start to look the same after a while), but this one has a few of the most impressive sequences I've ever seen on film. I assume this is one of the most special effect-intensive movies ever attempted (aside form the latest Star Wars), and they do dazzle, so it's a shame the story doesn't quite measure up. It starts to get a little tired in the third act, but what the hell, I was entertained.Aside form Kevin Bacon, there were no real stand-out performances in Hollow Man. The invisibility serum seems to bring on severe emotional instability in animals, so Bacon's character decides to try it out on himself. Problem is, Kevin is already nuttier than squirrel turds so this is not the smartest of decisions, but he runs the project, so he calls the shots. Mayhem ensues. This is a really clever idea for a horror film, and the smart ways the scientists think of to detect Bacon in his invisible form never ceases to impress. It's nice to see technology has finally made it so that they can do just about anything you can think of in film.Paul Verhoeven is what makes this movie most attractive for me. I really love his go-for-broke, over the top directing style, and it's put to good use in this one especially. He took a step in the right direction by distancing himself from hack-supreme Joe Esterhaus in the entertaining but flawed Starship Troopers, and now he's back on his feet again. I can just picture him screaming like a madman on set, frothing at the mouth for ""more blood, MORE BLOOD!"". He doesn't shy away from gore, violence, sex, or anything. He just jumps right in. I like that. This movie is worth about an 8/10 stars. Worth the price of admission for the effects alone. G'night!",Hollow Man
229,jimboduck,"Paul Verhoven's Worst, which isn't necessarily terrible – 6 (Elizabeth Shue brings in an extra star)",6,21 November 2005,"Right now I am listening to my favorite reggae song on my twelve speaker home theater system. Let me tell you, it is rocking the roof off! Can you hear it? Oh, man, it's dope. You hear the 3/4 beat blasting the roof off?No, you probably can't.What if I told you that the song and the stereo system are magically INAUDIBLE. You can't hear the song even though it's actually playing through the speakers. Wouldn't that make things overly confusing? My point is that I've never understood how a movie about invisibility could work, much less do well. I don't think the concept has much potential, and I've always felt this way since seeing clips of the old black and white Invisible Man make footprints in the snow. Do you remember Disney's Pete's Dragon (1977) and how the thugs were hoisted into the air by a supposed invisible dragon? The movie was a classic for many other reasons, but if the dragon had never become visible to the audience, it would have made kids cry out of disappointment.I had always been suspicious of HOLLOW MAN for this reason specifically. I don't see how film can do invisibility justice. But after finding out that it was PAUL VERHOVEN'S Hollow Man, I quickly put it at the top of my to-see list.Without a doubt the most memorable scenes of HOLLOW MAN take place within the first half hour. First, an invisible gorilla is strapped to the operating table, and is brought back to visibility by an injected serum. The way the invisible gorilla writhes and screams in pain is enough to make an impact by itself, but we are treated to a meticulous CGI rendering of its anatomy. The skeleton becomes visible, then its organs, and eventually its musculature. The process is repeated with Kevin Bacon on the operating table, and the transformation from visible to invisible man is astounding. The top-notch CGI coupled with the screaming and kicking make for a scene that can stand among the best of its genre.But while these transformation sequences make quite an impression, the rest of the movie can pretty much be thrown away for two reasons:(1) The movie gets claustrophobic in a bad way, since the rest of the movie takes place mainly in an underground lab. The Invisible Bacon whines about not being let outside, where he could exercise his new powers, and I commiserate with him. The movie would have done itself a big favor by including scenes in public places, a supermarket for example, where the invisible man could wreak havoc on innocent bystanders. Instead the drama is pushed forward underground entirely by the clashes between Bacon and the other five members of his scientific team. Limiting the action to an underground lab severely shrinks the scale of the movie and wastes whatever potential the invisible concept had to begin with.PLUS(2) Kevin Bacon's sudden jump from ambitious scientist to crazed madman needs more explanation. Josh Brolin tells Elizabeth Shue, ""Kevin Bacon is a genius; he can go from A directly to D. I can't do that. I need the B and C."" Hey, me too. I need the B and C, too. Why does the happy-go-lucky doctor turn into a homicidal maniac? I see why the movie needs to turn Bacon into a lunatic. After all, where else would you get the dead bodies? But aside from the pretext of cabin fever, we never see WHY Bacon goes nuts. The invisible man's insanity and subsequent irrational behavior rings hollow in the absence of character development.If Verhoven had fleshed out (1) and (2), the movie would have been a lot better. Instead what you get is a shiny laboratory where the protagonist AND villain are non-existent. The suspense and drama are pushed forward by strange gripes among the characters that come out of nowhere. To make matters worse, the extra DVD features reveal how much work went behind creating the bulk of effects. The special effects team went to great lengths making the invisible Bacon appear in smoke, under a sprinkler, and underwater. If you ask me, it just looked like wisps of smoke and water. I can do that in my back yard! To achieve these effects, the crew had to paint Kevin Bacon either entirely black, fluorescent green, or dark blue with the matching contacts, all three of which were definitely cooler than the resulting invisibility. In my mind that stands as the biggest waste of time by a Hollywood production team I've ever seen.But what else would you expect from a paradox like ""See the Invisible Man!""Oh, but Elizabeth Shue looks good in anything she does.JYJimboduck-dot-com",Hollow Man

His portrayal of a man deranged by the ultimate power of invisibility is one of the best in SF films.In ""Hollow Man"", Kevin Bacon plays Sebastian Cain, a brilliant research scientist working on a Defense Department project: making a man invisible, then returning him to normal. They've got the first part down: invisible dogs and apes fill the ""empty"" cages around the lab.When Sebastian finds a way to restore a gorilla to visibility (in one of the cool FX scenes), he wants to immediately jump to ""Phase 3"": human trials. And, of course, he will be the guinea pig.But Sebastian didn't think about what it means to give up all his control to his research staff.  He quickly gets tired of being under surveillance all the time, and wants to get involved with things.Just how involved and what ""things"" I won't say.Bacon does as well as can be expected with a thin script. The set-ups are fairly obvious for this reason, and the last half of the movie ends up being predictable.Two and a half stars. Uncle Steve says wait for it to hit the dollar house.

Time after time we have seen a Good Scientist (Frankenstein, the Invisible Man etc etc) become a Bad Man because of his tamperings with Nature, and his gradual seduction by the power he controls, till finally he gets his just desserts. In this film, the main character is already absolutely unlikeable and morally bankrupt to start with, so who is surprised, and who cares, when he becomes even worse when he takes advantage of his invisibility? There's no moral dilemma there, just some rather good special effects wasted on an absolutely uninvolving story.

233,wall17,Benign updating of an old saw,5,9 July 2002,"I kind of like the small but periodically revived 'invisible man' genre,and I thought this was a decent, modestly imaginative updating ofthe basic schtick, albeit without much of the reflection of someearlier versions. Ignore the implausibility of a top governmentresearch project run by six attractive 20-30 somethings, OK? It willonly make your head hurt.The twists this version bring out of the old saw are that KevinBacon's character, Sebastien, acts a little more overtly on theimplicit possibilities of walking around naked and invisible. Sincehis friends and colleagues who turn into his nemeses are anex-girlfriend and her secret lover, there's a lot of possibility impliedin the initial set-up. The action-finale leaves a bit to be desired,and I suspect the filmmakers decided they couldn't quite take thelogical step of going completely over the top in the direction ofsexual predation (although there's one kind of extraneous, andtherefore somewhat offensive, victimization of a female characterwho is utterly uninvolved with the plot).The film would've been a lot better had they decided to go the'American Werewolf in London' route and add in a lot ofgenre-twiddling comedy to go with the usual horror and actionelements. The special effects are pretty cool sometimes, particularly thesolution to the age-old question about invisible movies about whythe invisible man always just disappears (he doesn't, annd that'swhere the cool effects come in.)I can only give it a mild recommendation if you like movies in thegenre, need a mild brain candy escape, or want to see KevinBacon's package in false color visualization.",Hollow Man

Like why did Sebastian go mad (what sort of substance in the invisibility serum for instance did effect Sebastian's mind). What did I like about the film: 1) The special effects (excellent!!!!!!), even better maybe than in The Matrix; 2) The first hour, an excellent opening; 3) Elizabeth Shue; 4) Some camera-use reminded me of an old classic, namely Halloween (and Child's Play); 5) The music was great (Jerry, Jerry).Overall I'll give this movie a 6,5 out of a 10, no more.

255,spazierganger,Very good until the end,6,17 August 2000,"Hollow Man starts off as a genuinely creepy movie, and it lasts for most of the film. While there's nothing incredibly original about the story, it's still pretty good. Like I said, it's very creepy not knowing where Sebastian (Kevin Bacon) is, or what exactly he's going to do next. Plus, the special effects are extremely good, and actually add to the creepiness for the most part, which is more than can be said for many big budget movies. However, near the end, the last 1/3 or so, Hollow Man turns into a pretty typical Scream-type slasher movie. Sebastian goes around trying to kill all of his co-workers, and nothing very startling happens. It's not creepy anymore, because we know what he has planned. It's a shame that it was so good for the first 2/3, and then degenerated to that. Also, I have some issues with the realism at the end...I won't say exactly (I don't want to spoil it) but Sebastian seems awfully hard to kill.Overall, every aspect of the movie is good for the first 2/3 or so. It's very creepy, the acting is good, and the effects are amazing. It really looks like there's an invisible man there. But the film loses some of the excellence in the last third. The acting and effects are still good, but the plot is pretty bad. But this doesn't totally ruin the film, it's still very enjoyable.Rating: I'd give the first 2/3 10/10, but the entire film gets 8/10",Hollow Man

This is not an adult oriented sexual thriller story. The Invisible Man is a tragic story, Cane was an egomaniacal bastard, with no real redeeming values, so how were we supposed to feel sorry for him. We can't. We should have been cheering when they found a way to reverse the procedure, but of course they never did find away and off the story went into Kruger mode, deep underground, confined Alien- like in the lab. Of course all the explosion didn't matter to the Army above, just another day in the 'hood. Man, how very dissappointing. The effects were quite a sight to see, but Special Effects do not a movie make. You would think the stiffs in the big chairs would know that by now. Did they preview it to a test audience? The audience was laughing when I saw it. I was crying. A great movie shredded by a man so preoccupied with sex that he loses the passion, and compassion. I don't care what films he did in Europe, in the US we want a story! We want to feel something for the characters. We want to something other then latex sex, rape, and lewd behavior. As for the cast, they were handed a lame script and ran with it. Both Shue and Bacon are known for taking a wide variety of roles. And I like them both, but they should have passed on this.

""Way, dude, it looks pretty sweet.""  I am sure everyone heard that little conversation when the trailer for Paul Verhoeven's new sci-fi thriller ""Hollow Man"" came on the big screen during the 15 minute preview opus one gets at the theaters.The hollow script centers around one Sebastian Caine (Kevin Bacon), a genius scientist working on a government funded project to make a living thing disappear then reappear.  Unfortunately, the reappear part is giving him a hard time.  On a steady diet of twinkies and no sleep Caine finds the missing link and rounds up his crew.  Of course, calling his crush and former love interest, Linda McKay (The very attractive Elisabeth Shue, grrrrrrr) first so he can have his bragging rights.  When the team gets to the lab they make the invisible gorilla visible again in a very impressivespecial effects gala. Oooooooooo, ahhhhhhhhh.  Yes, what one says when those wacky effects make our eyeballs drool.  Now, the Caine man has done it but humans are next.  Of course, the soon-to-be psychopath wants to be first. After he is transparent they have trouble getting him back to his former self, one you could see without goggles reading his body heat.  The invisible time makes him go cooky if you catch my drift.Well from here on in you can see where the story goes.  Caine goes psycho, people get hurt, good triumphs, yup yup.  Verhoeven offers us yet another disappointment in a string of American movies that is only highlighted by his campy 1997 sci-fi thriller ""Starship Troopers"" and his 1987 cult classic ""Robocop"", which both also suffered from hollow script syndrome but was at least were fun to watch.All in all, a sci-fi thriller without the thrills but lots of cool special effects and another link for ""Seven Degrees of Kevin Bacon"".5.5/10",Hollow Man

261,jacob rosen,Is Verhoeven Some Sort Of Savant Or What?,3,26 October 2001,"Another violent, angry fantasy from Paul Verhoeven. Verhoeven is a puzzle: it's difficult to tell whether he takes his sordid impulses seriously, with sardonic intent or operates in complete oblivion. He also seems completely ignorant of the fact that all the brilliant visuals in the world (and this has some outstanding ones) cannot hide a negligence to story, dialogue and performance. Kevin Bacon plays a corrupt scientist who has discovered invisibility and uses it to drive himself into moral bankruptcy. Bacon is normally a likable actor who occasionally shows his dark side (`The River Wild') in an attempt to offset his boyish looks; given the material, however, Bacon isn't nearly hateful enough to compel. The other principals are Elisabeth Shue and Josh Brolin, neither of whom are gifted enough to make a solid impression and who, when forced to deliver inane dialogue, embarrass themselves. The climax is a study in preponderance and disbelief has to be truly suspended.",Hollow Man
262,BobbyG,Did They Really Spend That Much on This?,5,14 June 2002,"This film started out very good and it kept me on the edge of my seat for the first hour or so.  However, about halfway through it deteriorated to such a degree that I had to say to myself ""what were they thinking?""  The stupidities and complete unbelievableness escalated to an extreme degree. 
Spoilers ahead!  A gorilla and Bacon go through an extremely excruciatingly painful and life threatening conversion from a visible state to an invisible state.  There is no dread on the part of Bacon or his crew the second time he is due to endure this torture.  Everyone acts like he's getting a routine measles shot.  Another example of silliness involves the lovely Shue and boyfriend Brolin who were locked in a freezer room.  The thermometer shows the temperature dropping about 10 degrees every 5 seconds or so.  Shue and Brolin are in there for at least 3 minutes and they aren't violently shivering!  It must have been -75 degrees.  Shue was able to sit around for awhile and concoct a powerful magnet to free them from certain death. Brolin, who received a severe gash by Bacon and had to be dragged out of the freezer is later able to whack Bacon and climb the elevator shaft with Shue like nothing happened to him.  Bacon, who is blasted by a incredible explosion and inferno is somehow able to emerge in the elevator shaft to have one last shot at Shue and Brolin.  Just plain dumb. Suspension of extreme disbelief is a requirement to enjoy this film.
This film had a lot of potential, but the writing made it completely uninteresting and grotesque.  It turned into an expensive Friday the 13th type of garbage.  Someone mentioned in an earlier review that it cost $84 million to make.  When I was watching it I was thinking to myself it must have cost a lot to make because of the great special effects...but $84 million!  Can't they buy a decent screenplay for that kind of money?",Hollow Man
263,Predator-11,Great special effects just couldn't save this one,3,9 August 2000,"I've been looking forward to Hollow Man since I first saw the trailer for it before Gladiator. I usually like big special effects blockbusters and I've enjoyed several of Paul Verhoeven's films in the past, namely Starship Troopers, Total Recall and Robocop. However, Showgirls is one of my least favorite movies of all time.The movie starts out pretty good, showing off the impressive special effects with an invisible gorilla being brought back. The transformation from invisible to visible or vice versa were astounding. I was very surprised at how real everything looked and was prepped for another fun Verhoeven SFX extravaganza. Unfortunately the movie plummets into a vertical nose dive from there.The premise is simple, scientist doesn't want to lose funding, tests new invention on self, goes horribly wrong. I'm not saying that plot is an important factor in the success of blockbusters but this one really didn't cut it. The change from normal scientist to psychotic killer isn't well defined. They should have put in more scenes of him messing with people on the street, there was one scene but it was confined to a small apartment. I walked into the theater ready to see an invisible man wreaking havoc on dozens of unsuspecting people, but it didn't happen. The whole movie just kind of slides by without a single really interesting thing happening. It just jumps from, him being normal to him being crazy without any real middle ground. I think it would have really spruced up this film to put in a whole period in which the camera follows Sebastian around while he lurks the streets, scaring people left and right. And during this middle period, we see a very frightening sense of power grow and grow in him up until the point that he snaps and goes completly insane. I guess they wanted to make the movie shorter or something because they cover this whole period in one 5 minute scene.So how about the end action and violence? Well, they waste all the really impressive special effects in the beginning of the movie so there wasn't really anything there. The action is fast and bloody but it tends to end before you really get a satisfying look at what's going on. It's very disappointing because as soon as the final showdown between Sebastian and the other scientists begins you already know how it's going to end. It's very easy to guess exactly who's going to live and who's going to die.All in all Hollow Man was a big disappointment. The special effects were very good but it didn't make up for an incredibly thin plot and a lack of explanation. I give Hollow Man 4 stars out of 10.",Hollow Man

Director Verhoeven, puts on the same kind of silly ending that he used in BASIC INSTINCT, where the bad guy does a Lazarus, and comes back for one more try to kill the opposing lead. One should always approach this kind of movie with suspended disbelief, but enough already!. The only thing that makes this movie worth watching at all, is the special effects. Better luck next time Mr. Bacon.",Hollow Man
265,RolltheClip,"Hollow script, hollow acting, Hollow Man",4,19 April 2014,"Invisibility, a premise that many have often pondered at a time in their existence. What would we do if we were to harness the ability to disappear? Would we travel across country, drifting unnoticed into planes and onto the back of buses, or explore people's true opinions of us when we aren't around? The possibilities are endless, the self discovery and mischief that you could inflict could be catastrophic and without consequence. The allure of the idea finds its foundations within this and there has been an assortment of different scenarios caught on film over the years, one being Paul Verhoeven's Hollow Man.With a filmography that includes such enjoyable popcorn fuelled outings as Starship Troopers and the original Total Recall, the bar was set for Verhoeven, yet it falls short at almost every hurdle. When the egotistical scientist, Sebastian Caine (Kevin Bacon) succeeds in producing and reversing the effects of an invisibility serum, he manipulates his co-workers, primarily his ex girlfriend Dr. Linda McKay, and Dr. Matt Kensington into withholding the information from the military. All for the selfish purpose that he be the initial human test- subject. Clinging on to what he believes to be the pinnacle of his career, he pushes that he should be used in the trial, hoping to stay relevant within the field.The movie deteriorates as Sebastian's exploration of his new-found ability flounders into old and stagnant waters as he fails to test the boundaries of his experiment, instead, he opts to just ogle several women he knows from the female scientists within his team, to the lady across the street before plunging into the depths as it becomes a mediocre slasher film. I expected there to be more of a story arc outside of the confines of the laboratory yet it sells itself short when the remainder of the feature is spent with a seemingly invincible force as he hunts down his former colleagues.Although Bacon's surprisingly versatile acting talent has the strength to carry some of his films, this is an exception. Granted, his performance gives Sebastian layers, yet it is still unable to redeem the rest of the movies faults as his descent into madness seems sudden and unjustified.Regardless, the special effects have stood the test of time with impressive sequences of his transition into invisibility, otherwise, the film has few redeeming qualities as it leaves footsteps on regularly walked grounds, leaving the viewer groaning as the antagonist survives an excessive amount of fatal situations. Whilst Bacon may be invisible, the weaknesses within the plot are all too noticeable for an audience to ignore.",Hollow Man

He goes by the name of Paul Verhoevan and he has just directed maybe the best special effects movie of our time.Hollow man is a thrilling, sexy, exciting yarn about scientists trying to create a serum that can transform a man invisible, then turn him back again. But it's the turning back part thats the problem...The gorilla sequence at the beginning is astonishing, and her transformation from transparency is out of this world!  Kevin Bacon and Elizabeth Shue give fine performances helped by a good supporting cast, Bacon explores what a person would REALLY do if they could be invisible, and as a result their are many breasts on show for his (and our!) entertainment.A good, pacy script and ok storyline make this a must see in your local cinema, but quick! it might lose it's effect on VHS or DVD so hurry!!",Hollow Man

I admire the way Verhoeven introduces the characters and how they have a sense of humor, but unlike most Verhoeven films, the movie itself doesn't have enough humor for it to fall into the comedy genre. The acting overall was above average compared to most slasher films.What makes Hollow Man a good movie is not the story, not the cast or characters, but the amazing special effects work that would otherwise make a film like this impossible. The crew has truly made an invisible man, without the use of things like a floating hat suspended on piano wires and other practical effects (effects done on set). The most stunning effects scenes are not seen while Kevin Bacon is invisible, they are when Kevin Bacon is becoming invisible and visible.The problem is that this invisible man story deserves to be more imaginitive. Here, it takes place at a lab for the most part. I would have enjoyed seeing the invisible Kevin Bacon robbing a bank and getting away with it, or let's say steal something from people's purses, or something like that.

That's how I approached HOLLOW MAN.But it didn't work this time.  The best part of the movie was the joke Kevin Bacon told about Superman having sex with Wonderwoman.  The effects are fun to watch, the story is engaging on the level of a comic book---all fine and good.  But only for the first half.There was so much that could have been done with this movie's concept, but about half way through it, it takes a turn and becomes a slasher movie, just watching people get killed one at a time.  The change in Kevin Bacon's character was so sudden that it was impossible to suspend disbelief any longer.  He becomes completely homicidal and it's just too much to swallow.Even from comic book movies, there has to be some thread to the action that makes sense.

The special effects first off are some of the most spectacular that I've ever seen... the premise is highly interesting but, the story and actors are totally boring. Kevin Bacon is pretty good as the protagonist of the film but, once his DNA structure leaves the film, so do the other characters and most of the acting. I really think that if the director was going to make a film with a premise of this calibur and a script of this mess, he could have at least filled it with more SFX... and that could have kept my attention from after the first 15-minutes to the last 30. along with the other people who saw the film.

Two things it does particularly well are the invisible effects and it's willingness to take on gritty subject matter. This is a Verhoeven film after all, so I guess the second point shouldn't be a surprise. The question of what an invisible man would do with his new-found power goes all the way back to Plato and the Ring of Gyges. Verhoeven's answer is -- rape, violence and murder. This is a turn off for some people, who criticize the subject matter as being beneath contempt. Two reasons why I think this is an invalid criticism of this film: 1) For all it's money, this is a B-movie concept, with all the gratuitous subject matter that comes with it, and 2) Real-life experiences when societal norms break down indicate that behaviors such as rape and murder escalate greatly, so the Bacon character's behavior, while often over the top, isn't all that unbelievable. Without the restraint of society, the Bacon character goes to satisfy every lust and impulse, including feeling up female co-workers, killing animals that annoy him, raping a sexy neighbor (a reportedly graphic scene that was cut in the theatrical release but will be on the DVD) and murdering potential threats to his plans.Who will like this? Horror/sci-fi lovers, lovers of B-films and action movies. If those movies tend to not be your cup of tea, you will probably be better off avoiding Hollow Man.

In other words rampant over acting on almost every level. Starship Troopers got away with it because it was such a macho world the characters inhabited. In this scientists are acting the same way. Sorry Paul but Soldiers and scientist are not really made of the same mindset.One major flaw in the plot was that after escaping for that one night to do evil things Kevin Bacons character then returns back to the science lab where we have already spent more then enough time watching these animated manniquens (Elizabeth Shue excepted) walk and talk. Why not show the extent of what the character could do in the outside world. How could they possibly track him if he could be anywhere at all???

I do go expecting to see something different, or at least something shown in a new light.  It's filled with visually stimulating sight gags that I enjoyed, but it's almost like the filmmakers wanted to balance that out with the plot instead of giving it a plot to complement the special effects.I won't say what the movie is about, we all know what it's about, and the trailers these days like to give away as much as what's possible in 30 seconds.  So since we know that Kevin Bacon is a scientist that becomes invisible after being injected with some sort of magical potion I'll say that's not the problem I have.  What annoys me most about books and movies is when a character goes berserk with no motive whatsoever.  Yes, if I was a scientist whose Invisible Man project wasn't going quite as planned I'd be frustrated, but this movie gives it grounds to become a serial killer.  How did he ever make it through medical school?  Surely some of the rigorous testing would have made him burst.  Or maybe he's just one of people who take a lickin' and keep on a tickin'.  Whatever it is, I don't buy it.And maybe I would be able to look over some of this if it didn't make Kevin Bacon some sort of supernatural being also.  The movie never said anything about the potion making him able to withstand being torched, electrocuted while drenching wet, beat with crowbars, and falling down elevator shafts. Some scenes made me do nothing but shake my head.I guess if a movie cannot respect my intelligence I can't recommend even seeing it for the eye candy.

Unfortunately, the corruption of Bacon's character is done without any subtlety, and the last reel of the film descends rapidly into run-of-the-mill action-packed absurdity.

OK, so far so good. Great effect, I must say. Then, after the letters migrate together, something horrible happens:A standard, run-of-the-mill black bold font is imposed adjacent to these creative semi-transparent characters! As if the world cannot read these semi-transparent characters, someone decided that they better place some regular characters next to these obviously well art-directed semi-transparent characters!

Hollow Man is, unfortunately, his weakest film to date.Sadly, the premise of this film is a man becomes invisible and his basic pursuit is vouyerism.I would like to know how the writers, producers, director and other non FX creators decided that audiences would find it appealing to see an invisible man walk into 3 almost-consecutive scenes only to surrepititiously try to view non-invisible people, all the while not doing anything much more unoriginal than brushing a non-invisible man's hair, possibly watching a non-invisible woman going to the bathroom, or tilting a mirror to `shock' another non-invisible woman while she brushes her hair.If you have seen Robocop or Starship Troopers and are anticipating that sort of cunning omnipresent stylishness, you are bound to be disappointed.The only (and I emphasize ONLY) good component of HM are the special effects which are very, very good.

287,indianajonze,A Very Good Film That Simply Falls Apart at The End,6,5 August 2000,"I very much wanted to like Hollow Man, and to some extent I did. Paul Verhoeven is a talented director (not counting Showgirls) but unfortunately this film is firmly entrenched in the ""miss"" column. This is frustrating in that he had a pretty excellent movie that simply derails during the last half hour. Kevin Bacon did an admirable job as the cocky, arrogant yet brilliant scientist who slowly over the course of the film becomes affected by his invisibility in ways he couldn't have predicted. My main problem with Hollow Man (and there were several, all within the last 30 minutes) is how utterly absurd the film becomes. Here we have a team of (assumed) incredibly brilliant scientists who huddle like frightened school children when the invisible Bacon becomes deranged and begins killing. Its as if they had no idea it was going to come to this, despite the fact that earlier Bacon sexually assaults a colleague, escapes from the lab, covers it up and lies about it, and kills a lab dog with his bare hands. A normal person, let alone an intelligent scientist, would have pulled the plug long before it got to this point. The scientists are utterly stupid toward the end of the film. They have many resources available, from infrared glasses to make him visible, to tranquilizers, that they rarely if ever used. They run around blindly bumping into one another while never really using the tools available to them. Further, the protagonist is burned with steam and engulfed in flames from a flamethrower (to the point where EVERY stitch of clothing is burned off), hit in the head with a crowbar and electrocuted, yet still manages to walk about unscathed to cause more harm. I am NOT an idiot, yet the ending of the film treats me as one. Verhoeven, as a filmmaker, should have demanded a rewrite of the script's end. A disappointing movie in that for the first 1.5 hours, this was a solid 8 (possibly a 9), and the last 30 minutes is a 1. Final review: 6. I would recommend seeing it if for nothing else the astounding special effects and a rather good performance by Kevin Bacon as a mad scientist.",Hollow Man

Script:...Script:...Just enough characters for him to kill each of them off in a fancy way, but you never really get to care much about any of them.

Empowering Elisabeth Shue's character at the end was exciting, but I could have done without Freddie Krueger stuff that was inflicted on the rest of the staff. I expected more cat-and-mouse mental warfare between these MENSA candidates. All in all, I liked it, but, as in many movies, I can't help but think ""woulda,coulda,shoulda"".

This film reminded me of Twister in that if you take the special effects away, you've got next to nothing.  The idea of an invisible man grappling with the power he now possesses was good...and the fact that Kevin Bacon's character already had a ""God complex"" to begin with made the results inevitable.  But the execution of this idea didn't come off well in this film.The biggest problem I had with this film is it relied too heavily on its special effects.  Yes they were very interesting to watch (the ape being reconstructed before my very eyes bordered on creepy) and made the concept of invisibility almost believable, but take those effects away and all you've got left is a bad and illogical subplot about Pentagon involvement, an over-played love affair between Linda (Elisabeth Shue) and Matt (Josh Brolin), a bunch of brilliant lab assistants (obviously they must be pretty sharp or they wouldn't have been involved in the project to begin with) acting less than brilliant, and a mad scientist turn homicidal.The Bottom Line: If you're looking for a little mind candy, sci-fi fun, and some cool effects, this film rocks.",Hollow Man

296,Mr Mauve,"idiotic crap... cool looking crap, mind you (minor spoilers)",3,4 January 2001,"This film is a great example of a production of the laziest screenplay I have ever read. In my opinion, the key to great science fiction is to create an utterly real world around the elements which require suspension of disbelief. This world is totally unreal.For some reason the 'monster' in this movie can't be killed by a severe blow to the head with a crowbar, a massive electric shock or being burned over his entire body with a blowtorch. These things don't even slow him down, actually. He could kick anyone's butt with 3rd degree burns and massive brain hemmorhaging. The 'monster'  is a normal man who happens to be invisible. I think Paul Verhoven was confused- perhaps he thought invisible also meant invincible.I'm not going to waste my time writing about this movie. Just look at the goofs page, they pretty much explain everything.If you have a mental deficiency and only like movies if they feature boobs, explosions and thoughtless unexplained violence, then you will love this movie. If you have up to a 6th grade education, you will be laughing half the time and annoyed for the other half. Sure, the effects were impressive... but they still looked a bit fake. Jurassic Park is still the best I've ever seen. I think we're a far cry from recreating the human form, even when we have the opportunity to render the graphics directly over a picture of Kevin Bacon.Either way, this is a fun movie for people who like to pick apart details of a poorly thought out movie and feel superior.

Well, our mad scientist here (played by Kevin Bacon) could think of no other thing to do but fondle and rape women.. This is all his supposedly ""genius"" mind could think of. Does he try to gain extra power? No. He doesn't even bother research a way to get back to being visible. The guy is basically a sex crazed maniac.Add to that, the lab atmosphere, you have all these young guys.. Throwing around jokes like they were in a bar.. If it wasn't for all the white coats and equipment, you would think this is a bad imitation of ""Cheers."" Very shallow and poor personalities and very little care is put into making you think these guys are anything but lambs for the Hollow Man's wolf.Even as a thriller, the movie falls way short because most of the ""thrilling"" scenes are written out so poorly and are full of illogical behaviors by the actors that are just screaming ""this is just a stupid thing I have to do so that the Hollow man can find me alone and kill me.""If you read the actual book, while the Scientist (Cane) goes after women, there is a lot of mental manipulation and disturbing thought that goes into his character.

Kevin Bacon plays a BAD GUY - the sort who doesn't need any motivation to go crazy.  The movie makes some attempt to imply that invisibility affects the brain and makes creatures aggressive, but Bacon's character doesn't do anything while invisible that he wouldn't have done while visible, if he could get away with it. 
They just don't do very much in this movie.  All the action could have taken place in an hour-long TV episode, and that's what it feels like.  The action is confined to few locations without having any atmosphere (as compared to Alien, which was similarly confined but that added to the tension).Most importantly, this movie cannot be seen except in the context of Adam Rifkin's (as Rif Coogan) ""Invisible Maniac"".  If you haven't seen it, look it up now!  It is also about a scientist who goes crazy after injecting an invisibility serum, and in fact the opening voyeuristic shots of Hollow Man are very similar to the opening of Invisible Maniac.

From the flat out bad plot, to the ""horror movie stupidity"" of the characters, this movie reeked, even worse, it had such promise...I had high hopes for this movie originally  - it could have been a great movie exploring what a real person would do if suddenly granted invisibility, and how it might slowly erode your morals since ""Who's going to know?""  The temptation would be great, and in the hands of Kevin Bacon, one of the most versitile actors in Hollywood, it would be a superb movie.But ""Hollow Man"" disappoints.  We never CARE about Sebastian, and he strikes us as the type of person who might off somebody who seriously got in the way of his progress ANYWAY.  He is crass, cruel and egomaniacal, so his descent and fall is not a surprise; it's inevitable.The plot is like a 22 minute ""Twilight Zone"" or ""Tales From The Crypt"" episode someone thought might be a good idea for a movie. No surprises, no twists, and so MANY slasher movie cliches it is sickening.  You KNOW what will happen before it does.  I hate it when a movie spends so much time (and money; the special effects are excellent, too bad they are wasted here) getting you to believe in the thin scientific premise surrounding the plot (which I have no problem with; they did a good job here, albiet briefly, and I'm prepared to suspend a little disbelief), and then ignore BASIC PHYSICS and totally and blatently destroy the disbelief they worked so hard to create...Example - End of the movie.  The insane invisible killer gets fried by Elisabeth Shue with an impromptu flamethrower.  OK.  Fine.  THREE SECONDS LATER he is running after her full tilt.  Apparently, invisibility grants super-healing.  He is then hit FULL ON THE HEAD with a CROWBAR, and immediatly jumps up to attack our heroes while their backs are turned. Then, while all three main characters are each standing in THREE INCHES OF WATER he swings a crowbar into a high-voltage box, frying himself and turning himself semi-visible, while the others escape.  Apparently, invisibility also hinders conductivity, otherwise all three would be dancing the electric boogaloo.  Fast-forward - Sebastian is apparently unconcious.  Heroes climbing to escape explosion (which should have fried them all, but thats just an action movie cliche as well:  Flames licking at the heros feet while he climbs/runs/drives/jumps to safety.)  Huge explosion.  FROM THE WRECKAGE comes the semi-visible Sebastian?!?!?!  Either he got caught in the explosion, and he should be dead, or he was on the elevator with them, and they would have seen him since he was SEMI-VISIBLE!!! ARGH!!!!  I am prepared to suspend disbelief, but this is TOO MUCH!!! And he has the strength the tangle with the heroine after the MAJOR COOKING, CROWBAR TO THE HEAD AND THOUSANDS OF VOLTS OF ELECTRICITY!!!!  Just ONE of these would be enough the make me say ""now hold on,..."" but ALL THREE!!! PLUS him crawling IMPOSSIBLY FROM THE TWISTED WRECKAGE OF THE ELEVATOR!!!To make matters worse, Kevin Bacon and Elisabeth Shue are fine actors both. But to have this movie devolve into slasher movie stupidity is unconscionable.

The only way to salvage this film would have been to bring back the cast from a 1970s disaster flick to ham it up (the way Robert Davi redeems his scenes as a pimp-channeling-Fonzie in ""Showgirls"").  What there is in ""Hollow Man"" instead is an all-too-earnest cast.  For all its visual pyrotechnics, this film lacks any spark.

These issues were dealt much more intelligently in the classic The Invisible Man from 1933.  There is one scene of violence in particular that is so incredibly ambiguous, and is not mentioned once later on.

315,jannisschaefer,Not hollow at all.,9,22 September 2020,"Hollow Man is an underrated semi-remake of the universal studio Invisible Man series. While the former might not live up to the latter, it is still a solid, I'd even dare to say great movie. It feels like every contributor to this movie, sat in a huge room and discussed concept for invisibility and the things you can do with it, but I'm getting ahead of myself. To start my actual review, one of the good aspects is Kevin Bacons character, the titular individual named in the title. He is a man who you can't help but feel sorry for, even though he cements himself as quite a douche in the beginning. When he inadvertently causes a lab accident, he begins to transform into an invisible man. Though in this movie they show some details of said transformation. He transforms only gradually over time with his skin being the first part that disappears. The effects in this scene and the entire movie for that matter are great. At first the invisible man adores his new powers, but subsequently begins to resent them, as he feels restricted and Like a lab rat. For example, when he tries to sleep he can't, because although he closes his eyelids, they are invisible and so he can see right through them. Initially you feel sorry for him, until he leaves the lab, stalks women, subsequently raping one of them, committing murders and even killing a poor dog at some point. Now to the part where it gets most interesting. The finally is the only part I take issue with, but we'll get to that soon enough. Here they use almost every tactic you possibly could to detect someone who is invisible. They use Heatvision, but he busts some pipes causing hot steam to burst out. The cut open infusion packs to track the trace of footsteps he leaves on the ground. They turn on the sprinklers to get a clear visual of his silhouette and more. Now to my only gripe. He survives too much. For example he manages to survive high voltage that should kill him, but doesn't. And this is just one example. In conclusion I can say that it is the worst Invisible Man movie ever conceived, in comparison to the original and the 2020 reamake, but it is still an awesome depiction of the character. If you like aforementioned movies, give this one a go.",Hollow Man

The DVD shows just how much effort went into animating the interactions between sebastion and his surroundings, down to muscle structure, skeletal stance and internal organs. (If I were Kevin Bacon, I would demand to have the masters for those files; the filmmakers know more about his body than he probably does.) The supreme skill on the visual effects grants this movie four points alone. Throw in Shue and Bacon, you get another two. But the script is just weak, weak, weak.... High school students who have no medical experience other than watching ER could write better dialogue between the characters, particularly in the reversion sequences. Verhoven shows an incredible amount of passion in his filmmaking, he just needs to ""rein in his exuberance"" long enough to develop a script before charging forward into production....6/10",Hollow Man

Once Caine is invisible he starts to get off on the power and when all attempts to bring him back fail he starts to get violent too.The movie has fantastic effects, which are, of course, needed in a film like this.  Paul Verhoeven's direction is pacy and the script is as you would expect from a movie like this.  Although Bacon is not visible for most of the movie, he plays his role excellently - so much so that you would believe he really IS invisible.Elisabeth Shue heads up a good supporting cast which also contains a small role for Rhona Mitra (ex-Lara Croft) as one of Caine's neighbours who gets a surprise while she's undressing.See Hollow Man if you've ever fantasised about what you would do if you were invisible!",Hollow Man

What more could you ask for?Well, let's start at the obvious.  Although the actors do very well, I'm not certain that we've been given the best possible human props for this special effects masterpiece.  Compare with Total Recall - the previous reigning special effects action spectacular - and you'll see what I mean. Schwarzenegger, Stone, Ironside... it's a formidable crew.  Kevin Bacon does his best, and he does it well.  He's quite believable as a corrupted genius, and of course he's invisible for a good portion of the film.  Perhaps the problem is his invisibility.The main character in this film is clearly the villain.  It doesn't happen too often, and people complain that they want a film from the evil perspective.  Well, here it is.  Unfortunately the story is biased against Bacon's character, and we don't barrack strongly for him at any stage throughout the film.  His invisible antics are interesting (or exciting depending on your tastes) but we are always wary of his actions rather than enjoying his destructive attitude.Nevertheless, both the actors and the story take a backseat to the special effects.  Some of the computer work done in this film has not been bettered as I write, three years later - it is that good.  Impressive considering some other hype films (think Star Wars) fail to surpass the realism of the invisible Bacon character at times.Worth seeing for the special effects.  The 'what would you do?' element may appeal to some, and the typical sci-fi storyline of being trapped and picked off one by one is reliable as always.8/10 and a big smile.",Hollow Man

Take a director obsessed with sex and violence, add plenty of eye candy, and you got yourself your average summer popcorn flick. I found the movie to be good because I knew what I was getting into. Hollow man is just one more installment in a long line of special fx heavy movies with little plot. It seems directors these days think that if they pound us with sound and better and better cgi we won't pay attention to the plot, or lack of one. That's obviously bad, but if you walk into a movie like this knowing that, it's actually ok. The special fx are amazing, especially to a computer art student who can appreciate the amount of work that went into it. The premise is no-nonsense. You know and I know that if someone became invisible they would instantly realize the power they possess and use it for no good. That's what the movie set out to show and it did it well. Yes it had numerous problems with logic, but seriously is this the kind of movie you thought would make you think? That would go into the philosophical aspect of having all that power?

What he shows is horrible, but he doesn't convey any sense of horror, its almost gleeful.  Kevin Bacon starts out as a horrible man and becomes, well, a horrible man.  There is not one redeeming factor for this character, well he is indestructible (almost). This movie was boring and pointless directed by a man who is beginning to become very decadent in his directing, but it has no point.

After firstly testing the experiment on himself which is successful, Sebastian then commits crimes which he doesn't get prosecuted for; therefore adores his new life. He then realizes that the other scientists will be aware of his actions and that makes him go on a killing spree. This film is one of the best horror films i have ever seen. This got me on the edge of my seat the whole way through. The cast, action and script is very strong. Good use of CGI too (I know its fake but the CGI did look impressive.) I really like the way the actors work really well with each other in difficult situations. There really was a strong essence within the team.My only downsides is that the movie takes a while to get going.

Simply fantastic and unbelievable... an other more step in technology on the big screen.Kevin Bacon is so extraordinary in a very difficult character, a mix of a killer and scientist (I mean the transformation about a man of simple mind and another unbalanced).  The others can go home, absolutely...Director Paul Verhoeven (BASIC INSTINCT, TOTAL RECALL, STARSHIP TROOPERS) nevertheless made an excellent job like director, but he would consider himself to write his own script because he has ideas and like writers, I'm sure that ""his"" film would be a ""must"".So, between the delicacy of the effects and the brilliance of his production (subjective camera is very well control and the nudity scenes are sumptuous), the story is unforgiven for this who will watch the movie.

You can guess what's happening next without having a degree in media studies.  'He's dead, let's turn our back on him and walk off without properly checking first...', that kind of thing.It's pretty obvious in the film that either a) Paul Verhoeven is a dirty old man or b) Elisabeth Shue is deperately trying to re-invent herself as a 30-something sex symbol!  She wears the tightest tops and trousers known to man, she gets her kit off as much as she can but strangely in one scene where she's VERY cold, something is visibly missing but i won't go into that too much.The one thing that can be commended as first rate are the effects. The production budget has been mostly spent on these and it's very obvious from the part where Kevin Bacon very slowly dissolves to the wires attached his invisible face; because there is SO much detail throughout you do actually believe that you're watching a transparent Kevin Bacon.I can think of much worse ways to spend 2 hours in the evening than watching Hollow Man.

343,marie_baie_des_anges,literal torture...the worst kind,1,16 October 2000,"I do not know where to begin on this movie.  It was a mess, it was an insult, it was utterly painful and I did not recover from such pain for a while.  How one could direct or even worse, write this movie is beyond me. This movie had many bad components but the script was the ultimate worse. I felt very compelled to write a review for this movie like never before because I do not want others to suffer the same pain I and everyone around me did.  But I am surprised, no I am shocked that some people found this movie remotely entertaining, I was insulted.  I was upset that I actually paid to watch this in a movie theater and did not leave when I wanted to. Ok, enough of that, here is the actual review of the movie.*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS The minute this poor excuse of a movie began, the very second the mouse was eaten by an invisible force, I know there was no salvation.  When the outset of a film begins so violently, it basically shows that the director is trying to grab your attention, but does not know how to do the most important thing-hold it.  After that, we see that here are many intelligent scientists working on a clandestine project for the government, yet they all talk and act like morons.  The acting was laughable (maybe I would have laughed if I had not paid) with the exception of Kevin Bacon who could not save this film and I do not know what he was thinking when he starred in it. Elizabeth Shue astounded me how badly she was acting.  But I did not entirely blame her, for how can she act accordingly when the script was written by a bunch of lab monkeys mocking all the cliches the human world could possibly display.  Everything was injected with cheesy cliches, like Bacon attacking Shue (his ex and coworker) and saying, ""I always knew you were a b****.""  Why oh why did they do that?  That comment stands out in my mind the most, because it sums up the movie all on its own.All in all, the movie was boring, the outstanding special effects it had only lasted about five minutes, the script was pure cheese, the movie was stricken with a cliche epidemic, and the only horror about it is that a movie this bad was produced.",Hollow Man
344,ISNIndigo,An old dog learns an SPFX new trick.,6,27 May 2001,"""Man turns Invisible. Man revels in it for a while. Man goes nuts.""  That's the story that HG Wells started, and has been carried through cinematic history to Verhoven's HOLLOW MAN. There are a couple glaring errors in the otherwise gorgeous and disturbingly real special effects.  But other than that, the story is the same old thing with a year 2000 twist. There's only so much of this story that should ever come as a surprise to the viewer.  The rest is just the Invisible Man genre/cliche.Elizabeth Shue is taking advantage of the fact that she's getting too old for the cutie-girl roles, and playing scientists now. She just needs to pick slightly more plausible movies in which to play a scientist. In this, she seems little more than a comely toy for Caine's uninhibited tendencies once he becomes invisible. SPOILERS BEYOND THIS POINT! .....Four important things that would've kept the people in HOLLOW MAN alive: 1)  Tranquilize the gorilla BEFORE you make it invisible. 2) When you know well in advance that the invisibility serum causes erratic and aggressive behaviour, you put a transmitter or tracking device on your volunteer that he can't take off! 3) Don't answer the door wearing only your bathrobe if you can't see who rang the bell. 4) Do not turn your back on the invisible guy just because there's a camera on him! But to their credit, the scientists did have the presence of mind to start with fire extinguishers and sprinklers to give them a slightly more even chance against Sebastian Caine once he turns the whole thing into a game of cat and mouse.Best line:  ""It's amazing what you can do when you don't have to look at yourself in the mirror anymore.""Funniest moment: Two children spot Caine in his car wearing his latex mask. Caine takes off his shades and opens his mouth, revealing nothing but the back of the mask through the holes to the children.Four stupid things in two hours isn't a bad average.  The goofs in the SPFX were forgiveable in that the movie's rating was only PG-13.  Bacon's performance was solid and believable.  Shue needs to work on hers a bit.Oh, and the ""enhanced strength and resilience"" other reviewers here have complained about?  That's not a flub.  The insane or people on hard drugs [such as PCP] have exhibited berserker strength and resistance to injuries that would capacitate an ordinary person.  The climax was a bit ""suspend your disbelief,"" but isn't that true of all science-fiction?Six out of ten.  Good enough for DVD on a dull afternoon.",Hollow Man

346,RobertKS,"Big-budget, small-scope Invisible Man update",2,25 July 2000,"Verhoeven's digital-era entry into the Invisible Man genre doesn't borrow enough from the 1933 horror classic starring Claude Rains and a gorgeous young Gloria Stuart (from H.G. Wells' novel and directed by James Whale). Hollow Man's computer generated visual effects are pervasive and expectedly state-of-the-art, but the eye candy can't rescue a script that quickly devolves into a typical ""lock-a-bunch-of-people-in-a-room-and-wait-and-see-who-gets-killed-and-who-s urvives"" horror film.  The genre was overdone and out of gas a decade ago (witness the barrage of mediocre Michael Crichton films in the 90s), so why did the Amsterdam-born auteur resort to such mundane storytelling when he managed to make Total Recall and Basic Instinct into such clever classics?The first half of Hollow Man is largely setup and cool CGI.  In the middle of the film we get to see a brief bit of cool Invisible Man voyeurism action.  But the final half-hour is all slasher homicide, explosions, and badguy-comes-back-from-the-dead-for-one-last-scare tripe.  Potential wasted--we never really get to see Kevin Bacon go out into the world (the film is claustrophobically confined to an underground medical research lab) and wreak all the cool invisible man havoc that these movies should be all about!

347,Bernie-58,A great opportunity missed - Special effects get in the way,6,22 October 2000,"This movie about a mad scientist having to cope with the inability to return to 'visible life' is driven by gorgeous special effects, but gets finally lost in the superfluous final fireworks of explosions.
The plot: A group of scientists is researching ways to modify body quanta to make mammals invisible. The real problem they face is the reversion: getting the subjects back. After a successful treatment of a gorilla, the leader (Sebastian Caine / Kevin Bacon) is taking one step further and is stepping across the border towards invisibility. When the attempt to get him back fails, things get worse and the rest of the group has to fight an invisible killer....The Comment: The special effects are breathtaking and reach a new level. Especially the slow transformation into/from invisibility are a feast for the eyes and a good demonstration for every anatomy student. Add to this the various ways to make an invisible body nevertheless visible (smoke, water, liquids, body imprints) and it should be a sure Oscar-prospect. Unfortunately, the story ends here. The aspect of being invisible in the 21st century should provide enough chance for development and side-plots for more than one movie but is unfortunately neglected just to fit some explosions and people-slashing in.Great opportunity missed !!!!!",Hollow Man

350,Dicekid,"Hollow Man: all surface, no substance",1,9 September 2000,"What would you do if you knew you couldn't be seen? Screenwriter Andrew W. Marlowe and director Paul Verhoeven let their invisible man watch women undress and use the bathroom, fondle a sleeping co-worker and slip into apartments to terrorize and assault innocent females.Moreover, by suggesting aggression as a side effect of invisibility, the filmmaking team afforded itself the opportunity to depict as many disgusting acts of violence as possible. The hollow man screams epithets at women before hitting them repeatedly with full force - accompanied by earsplitting thwacks on the soundtrack. That's merely a warm-up for his murderous rampages. This sorry excuse of a sci-fi flick combines the prurient, soft-porn sleaze of Verhoeven's ""Showgirls"" with the over-the-top violence of ""Starship Troopers"".Before accepting the leading roles, Kevin Bacon and Elisabeth Shue should have considered what Verhoeven did to Elizabeth Berkley's acting career. Starring in this movie almost guarantees induction into cinema's Hall of Shame. Bacon plays Sebastian Caine, a cocky scientist who teams with his ex-flame (Shue) and her secret lover (Josh Brolin) in military-funded experiments that make animals invisible. They have problems reversing the process. Curiosity and arrogance drive Sebastian to test the procedure on himself. The special effects that transform animals and people into invisible states and then bring them back again are the movie's only redeeming element.Otherwise Marlowe's (Air Force One) script recycles every mad scientist and action cliche in the book. Similar to James Whale's ""The Invisible Man"", the 1931 screen version of H.G. Wells' classic fantasy, a megalomaniac inventor plays God and wreaks havoc on the world. Self-interest and revenge motivate his actions. But whereas Claude Rains delivered a radio performance - heard but not seen for most of the film - Bacon gets plenty of exposure. Literally.Add this big-budget thriller that packages misogyny, voyeurism and violence in the guise of entertainment to the Hollywood junk heap.

351,Spike-71,"So near, and yet so far!",5,2 October 2000,"I was really looking forward to seeing this movie. It seemed such a good idea on paper, but managed to end up disappointing me. It starts off quite well, explaining the story and reasoning behind their research. However, I couldn't help looking at my watch, wondering when the other scientists were going to make Sebastian Caine(played by Kevin Bacon) invisible. Before that point, it was moving too slowly.  As the character first explored his invisibility, it was interesting to watch as he got to grips with the idea of voyeurism without actually ever being caught. This seemed quite a sophisticated premise on which to base a film.   However, once his brain began to turn and he became perverted and psychopathic, it descended into the usual, unsophisticated, slasher-style fayre. It reminded me of that genre because, instead of having a crazed, psychopathic killer on the loose, we watched an invisible (who you could see half the time, anyway due to fire extinguishers, etc.), crazed, psychopathic killer on the loose.     In the ""Scream"" series, it was a deliberate joke that the parties kept splitting up. However, in this film, the victims, who were apparently the ""creme de la creme"" of science, but were actually quite limited when it came to common sense, kept separating, just to be picked off one by one so that the remaining parties could find them dead. It just became a guessing game of which dimwit was going to die next. The effects were not exactly amazing and although described as so by others, I wouldn't have said that they were ""ground-breaking"".     Kevin Bacon was at his ""hammy"" (no pun intended!) best and what was Elisabeth Shue doing in it? The lady from Leaving Las Vegas has really gone downmarket.

They really are spectacular. Especially when they change the gorilla and Sebastian invisible. That was just really interesting to watch. I also need to say something else before I go to the negative side. Kevin Bacon is the best actor in this film. He did a fantastic job with his role. He made you feel how angry he was for not being able to be visible, but he uses his invisibility to his advantage, especially when he decides to kill everyone off so he can live a normal life without no one ever knowing about what happened. Now, here is the negative, this film's plot is below average. It just seemed to take a predictable turn when Sebastian decides to kill everyone. I wish they would have done something different, or maybe even draw out the process of him becoming crazy just to make it more creepy to watch. Also, after watching this film recently I noticed another bad part of this movie, Elisabeth Shue. She is awful, and I mean awful in this movie! She was great in the 80s, but you can tell that she has lost her touch with this one. Every time an argument happens in this movie, she goes ""hey guys let's just go and celebrate!""

364,rob_fernandes,How Did This Make It To Cinema?,1,8 October 2000,"I get to the cinema every week or so, and regularly check out this site, but never before have I felt compelled to comment on a film.To my all time list of shockingly bad films - Last Man Standing, Spawn, The Bone Collector - I can now add the drivel that was 'Hollow Man'.From the awful opening titles - a ridiculously over-long run through of cast and crew put together with alphabetti spaghetti - through to the insulting finale - a world record number of cliches and some of the most absurd dialogue and acting to have ever made it to cinema - this film is dismal, and only the impressive computer graphics keep you from walking out long before the end.This isn't just my opinion - it was that of my friends, and everyone around us. When large sections of an audience are laughing and groaning during and after a serious thriller, its clear that the film is hopeless.Not only that, it was sick too. The director took the action beyond the bounds of realistic fare for a violent film, and into the realms of an over the top blood soaked B-movie. It's difficult not to imagine the director as some sort of dirty old man, because the extent of the invisible man's forays out of the lab and into the outside world extended only to two attempts at having a feel of some breasts. Perhaps sex could well be the first thing on a bloke's mind if made invisible, but aside from the aesthetic pleasures of the ladies involved, it hardly makes entertaining cinema.Get past the films sick exterior, and things are even worse. Whilst Kevin Bacon does a good job of acting increasingly twisted as 'hollow man', the rest of them  - perhaps handicapped by a dire script - do an even better job of being hollow cast. One long time member of the team is found strangled in a locker by the invisible man, ""He's finally snapped"" shrugs one colleague without a hint of emotion. This is par for the course, and the lab team swing between sheer terror and complete indifference with such speed that you wonder how they got into acting. They pad their way through the lab corridors terrified, guns poised, but then seconds later one of the crew skips happily off back down the corridor to get blood for a hurt colleague. The lead female treats the invisible man with courtesy and good humour even after he's insulted and abused her, and there seems to be little reaction to his breakouts, even after he drowns the Pentagon chief, ""He drowned in his pool last night"" reports the same female, spectacularly failing to put two and two together.The script is littered with this kind of badly acted pedestrian dialogue, and the rest is just an A-Z of film cliches, which get laid on thicker and faster as the film progresses to the point of complete disbelief and amusement at the end.The 'eureka' moment at the computer, the female undressing at the window, the looped security video - the list really is endless - the predictable disregard for strength in numbers, the decision not to kill the two main stars but just put them in a place of probable impending death and leave them to their own devices, the almost-dead good guy appearing out of nothing to save the woman, the bomb and ubiquitous countdown timer, the fireball explosion which just burns up before reaching the heroes, the falling lift which just stops before hitting them, and more than anything else, the immortality of the bad guy.The invisible man is burnt to a shred with a makeshift flame-thrower, electrocuted, whacked round the head with a bar which had just sliced straight through one of the lesser actors, and then having apparently survived the explosion, fireball and total destruction of the labs, has more than enough life left to climb up through the fireball for one last pop at the films heroes - by which stage the disbelieving audience are cringing and looking at their watches.That this exceptionally bad film actually made it to the cinema is astounding.

If it weren't for the visual effects I'd give this movie just 1 lousy star and that'd be only because of the system does not allow me to give a zero. The visual effects were the only thing that lived up to my expectations and they kind of saves this movie. The dialog of this movie is filled with stupid lines and the acting is bad.

Instead of a gorilla, another simian such as a rhesus monkey would do.-- If you're standing in a puddle of water and the guy next to you shoves a crowbar into an electrical distribution panel and electrocutes himself, shouldn't you dance the light fantastic right along with him?-- The laboratory explodes with an enormous fireball, yet (of course) our hero and heroine don't get singed, the fire doesn't produce any smoke inside the elevator shaft they're trapped inside until they stumble out into the light of day probably half an hour later, it doesn't even touch the invisible man (who apparently is fireproof, too), tosses an elevator car casually up at them, to come to rest (conveniently enough) inches above them, and the pressure wave from the explosion doesn't even pop their ears.-- Oh, yeah, and how about that explosion?  The nitroglycerine Caine cooked up was in a centrifuge with a timer on it... okay, I'll push the ""I believe"" button on that one, but in all the labs I've worked in, centrifuges are powered by AC... so even though the control console was wrecked, what stopped them from UNPLUGGING IT??Aside from the fact that I've always had a hard time envisioning Elizabeth Shue as a scientist (her role as a particle physicist in ""The Saint"" was bad enough), this is just a glossy summer blockbuster heavy on budget and light on substance, where dedicated, workaholic eggheads still seem to squeeze enough time in their busy schedules to work out regularly, get a tan, and ensure their hair is perfectly coifed.  In addition, the screenwriter neatly sidesteps all the ethical issues and moral dilemmas that could and should have interrupted the story long enough to give everyone pause and make them reconsider their actions.  Add to that a certain breast fixation, and you've got all the makings of a movie that appeals to the twelve year olds in the audience, but to anyone with half a brain and more than an eighth grade education, this will be a waste of time and money.  The Sci-Fi Channel's Invisible Man series is better done with probably half the budget.  Kevin Bacon and Elizabeth Shue do what they can to keep the audience interested, but even they can't save this ship.  Bottom line: wait till it comes out on video... and let someone else pay for it.",Hollow Man

The special effects are excellent, Elisabeth Shue has given one of her best performances in a long time, and Kevin Bacon also gave a very solid performance. I know many of you thought that the 3rd act took a bloody turn and it did, but to me, I didn't think it was that bad, I kind of thought it made the movie. Look at the movie's today that are making money, Scream 1,2, & 3, Urban Legend 2....all blood and guts with a moderately good plot. This movie just did what sells. And come on, it could be a lot worse. In my opinion, this is one of the best scary horror/thriller/action/man turned monster movies I had seen in a long while and after all, the movie can't be too terrible because the film has grossed so much.

But sometimes you have to sigh of movies in American mainstream only made for the purpose to sell tickets and to use what seems innovative but most of all are like new bottles of wine with the same old wine in. No human hand seems to have been involved in this manuscript. Shear brain from a robot made it and hoped to make it to a money machine, which it maybe became. The psychological part of this is a cliché, and the plot a lot of movies with Arnold Schwarzenegger (e.g. Terminator) or Sylvester Stallone seems much more convincing or honest than this attempt to make a movie. Paradoxically is what makes it to a bit more than awful the special effects where the human beings seems to be robots which seems awful, but again nothing new. Since Blade Runner, we know how human robots can be. The title is interestingly, because at the same time Sleepy Hollow was made, which of course was very differently but had this about the hollow side of man. And I don't know how many who watch Hollow Man, but Sleepy Hollow continues to be sent on a lot of TV channels, so it seems that Hollow Man only was made as some sort of remake of something we had already watched a lot of times. And people bought the tickets and soon forgot all about it. And this is really what the bad part of main stream is all about.",Hollow Man

Or the whole story?Elisabeth Shue (The Saint) was simply awful.  I've never been terribly impressed with Shue but this film brought out all the worst in her acting abilities.  She was stilted and clearly had no belief in what she was saying.  Kevin Bacon seemed to use the fact that he was covered in plastic as an excuse not to act at all.  Josh Brolin (remember him from The Goonies?) was slightly better but that is not exactly saying much.However, it was not all their fault.  The scriptwriters have to take a lot of the blame.  Some of the lines actually made me laugh out loud and really don't think that was their intention.  Plus, the whole premise of what would you do if you couldn't be seen was not explored in the slightest.   There were so many ideas that they could have followed and instead they produced a completely unbelievable plot that not even the, admittedly good, special effects could save.  To top it all off it wasn't even scary.  There were a few moments that made me squirm with revulsion, but that was about it.  I would not recommend this to anyone.  5/10.",Hollow Man

The story follows the premise of H.G. Wells book with the expected sexual innuendo for the modern era which is fine. But after all these decades you'd think some one would try some new twists.

In a film about an invisible man you have to ignore the basic scientific fact that, if you can't see him, he cannot see you (you guessed, i'm a physicist). You have to, else you'd have one damn boring film where no side can see the other. So ok, we accept that one.I'll even accept the infrared cameras being able to see Kevin Bacon, even though heat is a form of light and so the same comment above applies (though there is a credible way out of it)These things accepted i thought that the first half of the film was enjoyable, Kevin Bacon providing a good lead. Unfortunately i was then confronted with a second half that went from the sublime to the ridiculous. Why oh why does being invisible mean being invincible? Why does Hollywood believe that to make a good film you have to reject all common sense? To name briefly but a few:1) Apparently Kevin Bacon can electrocute a man standing in two inches of water whilst he himself stands in the same water. Last time i heard water is a good conductor. Body made of rubber?2) Kevin gets turned into a human torch by his flame-throwing ex and 30 seconds later has pulled off the burnt clothes and is ready to attack. Titanium skin maybe?3) Kevin gets whacked with a blunt instrument by his ex's lover and gets up again seconds later. Iron head perhaps?4) Kevin withstands a huge explosion and shimmies up a lift shaft ready to attack again.etc, etc, etc.I am disappointed. I'm giving this a 3.",Hollow Man

The invisible man stalking his heart's desire fed off of some very serious psychological terror, as it should have. The main problem with this movie appeared in the last third. In my honest opinion, they just slapped on the formula ""science-thriller"" ending. They abandonned the ""terror"" elements and went with just special effects and action/violence. With the exception of some beautiful computer graphics, there was absolutely no originality in this film.This film really reminded me of 1999's science-thriller ""Deep Blue Sea"" in many ways.Anyway, the special effects are the true star here, and Kevin Bacon had an excellent performance before he disappeared.

I just felt I had to add one or two points:SPOILER ALERT: some of the cliches mentioned below will give a bit away. But believe me, you'll see it coming anyway.
1. The cliches: I hardly know where to begin. This movie is just a morass of cliches thinly glued together by a cliched plot. You've got your arrogant scientist turns mad through overwhelming pride. You've got your bad guy who kills anyone with one blow, but himself repeatedly gets up after apparently fatal injury. You've got your chance to finish him off missed when he is assumed to be dead. Then there's your bomb discovered with seconds on the clock, the innocent who is told to stay put (but wanders off alone, into danger), the anxious scene with defibrillation paddles when someone undergoes a medical procedure, the elevator shaft climbing scene, and the anxious dash to escape as the bad guy's lair is destroyed. All in all, there hardly seems to be a single original scene in the movie - oh, except maybe the toilet scene, which is nothing to be proud of.2. Plot holes, nonsequiters, technical errors, and just plain nonsense. I'm not talking about the whole invisibility thing, all the attendant problems (like blindness), and so on. I'll allow ""suspension of disbelief"" for that. I'm talking about stuff like: no matter how the guy is marked, he's always invisible again in the next scene. Stuff like, letting rip with a flamethrower doesn't set off the sprinklers unless you aim right at them (not to mention several other fires...). Caine (Bacon) repeatedly comes and goes at a high security facility without any guards noticing his face is different. The victims have goggles that enable them to see Caine, so they leave them off as much as possible, and later forgo them entirely. Less than 200g of nitroglycerine annihilates a massive, reinforced concrete subterranean complex, in a fireball that roils for tens of minutes but doesn't emit any heat upwards. Restraints designed to restrain a panicked gorilla are repeatedly pulled apart by a man. High pressure steam pies are shattered by an air pistol dart. Walk-in freezers have no internal door handle (that would be too safe!) etc, etc etc3. The sexual assaults that no-one notices are one thing, but the toilet scene is really quite gratuitous. And it doesn't make sense, either: with a bizarre bathroom straight out of a marine bootcamp, there is nowhere for him to hide when she puts the goggles on. (She's looking at the door and cupboards the whole time).All in all, this is a highly dumbed down movie.",Hollow Man

The scenes of the gorilla appearing and Kevin Bacon vanishing are about as real as one could imagine them, right down to being almost disturbing. There's even several scenes outside the lab that really turned out spooky. Spookiness aside, the visual gags with Kevin Bacon's invisibility are great. Unexpectedly, the violence and gore delivered throughout was gratuitous and often, to say the least. But still, all special effects and makeup effects were superb, I was very impressed at how well invisibility shows up on the screen.On the flip side, there are cliches that were more than obvious, from the ""who's going to die first"" hunt to the indestructible villain to the ""I'm back for one more scare"" finale. And the explosions seemed overdone for a movie that already is overflowing with awesome special effects. But again, I was impressed at how well invisibility shows up on the screen.Hollow Man kept me at the edge of my seat, I kept wanting more as each situation presented itself to the Hollow Man, wondering what each new scene would look like, or how people would react.

The acting was OK throughout, and the story was enough to support the effects.  There are some gruesome scenes of partly formed bodies and blood and guts, so if you have a weak stomach beware.From a scientific standpoint, I have to say that the effect of modeling the Primates appearing and disappearing was actually a bit educational. If only our school system had a Hollywood budget our students would get some incredible anatomy lessons.The way the CG was done on these bodies was such a thrill to watch.  There are so many points where I wanted to sit back and think `how did they that?' but the action wouldn't stop long enough.  It was gory to watch as insides of the body became visible, but I couldn't take my eyes off because of the fascination over how hard it must have been to create those scenes.I recommend seeing it for the effects but the other aspects of the movie are not bad either. 7 out of 10",Hollow Man

425,theawakened,Another bludgeoning hit from Verhoeven,7,9 August 2000,"Despite the raging comments about fantastic special effects but a seemingly ""see through"" plot, Hollow Man delivers as an interesting take on a classic premise with a suspenseful twist.I find it interesting many people had very different expectations for this film;  this is, quite simply, a solid work that takes an age-old premise not as the focus of the film, but as the background, and carves with it a horror-suspense picture.  The believability of this picture is destroyed even before one enters the theater.  The idea of an invisible man is so far fetched and cliched that it seems ridiculous to reiterate the concept in a film.  However, it is done craftfully and tactfully.  The suspension of disbelief lies not in the concept of turning invisible - which would have been overly done, lame in general, and wouldn't have helped the suspension of disbelief - instead, it is with the concept of ""reversion"" back to visibility.  By using a psychological ""door in the face,"" the film takes the viewer just deep enough to get them settled in and not throw the concept of invisibility out the door.  They take for granted the larger of the two concepts is accepted, an interesting twist on typical approaches to science fiction.Kevin Bacon does a fine job as, as aforementioned in previous comments, an egotistical scientist with an acute personality;  a lot more realistic than most of us would like to believe.  Whether or not we like him is mostly irrelevant;  Elizabeth Shue is really the main character.  The script does a satisfactory job in establishing Bacon's character for later in the film.Once things go awry, the film slowly builds, Kevin Bacon doing things which at first seem playful, and then slowly degrading and finally horrifying. His aggression and slip of morality are done in a believable way, and the film does indeed play off of the ""what if"" idea, which no film of its type has ever done.  Most of the time, you find characters in horror films acting ridiculously, restraining themselves in a moral fashion just so that the audience can identify them, or putting themselves in ridiculous situations in which they are bound to fail.  Not in a Verhoeven film.  The people are treated as average, with an equal capacity for corruption, aggression, and stupidity as could be expected from normal beings.Having Bacon go out into the world more or pursue different interests would have been the worst direction the film could have taken.  The writer knew more than to create this type of scenario, and hence did not let it happen. The film would have become ridiculous and would have had to have relied on incredible plot convenience to keep the movie alive.  Instead, working within possibly the only boundaries to keep the film going strong, Hollow Man turns into a suspense film.   This is truly what the film was building towards all along and provided for a great climax.Near the end, although the violence is realistic (people actually bleed and lie down in pain when hit, un-like most R and below films these days), there are several scenes which stretch the bounds of believability.  Namely, the ones where Bacon is attacked.  The film justifies this through the aggression and adrenaline that insanity lends, but it does stretch certain things just a bit too far.  Nevertheless, such actions and climactical cliches I think were, in this case, called for.  The end of the film was quite exciting and incorporated some of the best special effects in the entire picture.  As usual, Verhoeven is aptly able to keep you on the edge of your seat.In sum, although this film was not the epic of Total Recall or Starship Troopers, it was a good, solid suspense film that explored an old concept in a new, creative way.  The sci-fi effects were amazing and the horror side was twisted enough to be a true Verhoeven film.  8 / 10",Hollow Man

Even more art (combined with a tad of computer power, of course) to put in the background/inside of the mask when they ""blue-screened"" someone or something out of the shot.I wish they'd have a better plot, however.  There are problems of rational science, naturally.  Invisibility by injection is a no-no.  Invisible syringe, anyone?  If it's keyed to biological processes, how do teeth bones and hair get affected in such a short time-frame.  I've no problem with suspending my disbelief a bit as far as that goes, however, and again with all the baggage that comes with it.  (Seeing is hard with eyes that don't interact with light.)Really, though, the movie aims too low.  It would be great Manga-type animation (blood'n'guts department) if it weren't for the fact you'd lose all the spectacular visuals you get from this 'live' action.  I think a more thought-provoking film could have been made with the same effects.  How about a film where the invisible guy is the victim?

Toward the end, when the bad guy starts killing off the good guys, the latter group act so stupidly that you want them to die, in order to cleanse the gene pool.

The most annoying point is, however, that at no point in the film does anyone explain whether the motivations for Bacon's character's madness are due to a power trip or a physiological reaction to his condition.Granted the special effects are impressive, and in the past Paul Verhoeven has done some good stuff (the director's cut of Robocop on DVD is great).

To sum up the movie, Sebastian Caine (Kevin Bacon) is a researcher to discovers how to make animals and seemingly people invisible. He works on this project with his ex-girlfriend Linda McKay (Elisabeth Shue) and Matthew Kensington (Josh Brolin) her secret lover.  Problems arise when Sebastian is made invisible and discovers his process to be made visible again failed.  He could not cope with being in the lab as well as his God-Complex running amok cause much terror to ensue.The problem with this movie that I had was that because of bad dialog and a bad plot this movie becomes F/X porn, because instead of the cheesy story taking us from one sex scene to another, it is to take us from one F/X scene to another.  They also art trying to grasp at this story of with great power comes great responsibility, but that never really gets across to you.  And the characters are so flat and boring and their actions at some times so moronic that you actually begin to root for Sebastian to kill them all, even though his character was clearly one who had problems.  And with the exception of just one or two, all of the characters are fatally flawed in a way that makes them just as bad as Sebastian himself.Personally, I am glad that all I did was rent this movie; to waste money on this for the big screen would have been a mistake.

There are a lot of things to like about the film: Eye-popping effects (the gorilla sequence is outstanding!), good casting, snappy direction and pace...but it just felt like something was missing.  With layered characters and a less predictable story, the initial concept of invisibility's effects on sanity and sexuality could have reached a deeper level.  Instead it's just an OK popcorn movie with few surprises and sub-par suspense.  Verhoeven did a great job of making Bacon invisible, but he couldn't hide the holes in the script.",Hollow Man

The film speaks to nothing endearing and noble in the human spirit.  I left the theatre saying, ""So what?""  What a waste of talent, time, and money.  Even a hollow man needs a heart.",Hollow Man
453,megmegmegmegmeg3,An Extremely Good Film,10,8 August 2000,This film expressed great special effects. I believe it is a great Movie for horror and science-fiction fans everywhere! My family and I loved this movie. It is unlike every other 'Invisible Man' movies because of it's content and extreme events which happen.,Hollow Man
454,stefurz,"Great idea, terrible movie.",6,7 August 2000,"This movie could have been so much better.  The special effects were great and the idea was really cool, but the acting was bad and the script was straight up c**p!  I also could have done without seeing Kevin Bacon's semi-invisible penis, seeing it in Wild Things was bad enough!",Hollow Man
455,jfriedland,Big Disappointment,1,5 August 2000,"This movie had so much potential to be good. It sucked. He had barely no contact with the outside world, which is what I thought it was going to be. It started out ok, but turned into a lame action picture. Elizabeth Shue and her boyfriend were definitely not likeable, to say the least. We were wishing Kevin Bacon would have killed them for sure. I could go on with what was wrong with the movie, but I won't bother. Don't see it. It's crap.",Hollow Man
456,dumouchelv,One of the best movies of the summer!!!,10,4 August 2000,"Not only is this movie awesome, but Elisabeth Shue, man! This girl is simply amazing, I've watched her since Karate Kid in the early 80's to this, and she hasn't missed a step yet. Some of her quotes in this movie reminded me of The Saint movie, the way she smiles and stuff. Kevin Bacon also does an awesome job. I've always wondered what I would do if i was invisible and they have put a lot of thought into that phase. An awesome movie to see for the summer get out of your house and get to your nearest cinema and watch Liz Shue and Kevin Bacon in the Special Effects blockbuster of the summer!~~~Think Your Alone? Think Again!~~~",Hollow Man
457,gnr4life,What Is Happening With People?,10,7 August 2000,"First off, i'm having a really hard time trying to figure out why the hollow man gets low reviews. The Hollow Man is a Sci-Fi Thriller, What else did you want them to do with the movie, did you want Kevin Bacon to turn into a pig and go to the market? Would you rate it higher then, the producer did everything he could to keep the movie as realistic as he could and he did. People, you went to see an invisible movie, that means everything is up for grabs, for instance, look at The Sixth Sense, most of you people love that story.. Tell me what was so good about that? I found nothing, i wasn't ""Thrilled"" about anything in that movie and if you check out the front cover of the movie it's suppose to be the #1 thriller of 99, hahah Rubbish... Other than the upstairs scene in the movie that was the only thing that got my sub par attention. And the ending of that movie was so realistic my roommate and I had guessed that half way through the movie. I was far more intrigued with the hollow man, i was actually scared three times in this movie that got me out of my chair, the last time I can remember that happened is when Freddy Kruger came out of the closet in one of the past episodes. The problem with viewers these days is they expect to much of a film, I have taken courses at college on Film Genre, and Media arts, so i know how people react to certain things. The only thing i can see what happened with this movie is people expected way too much from it, all the critics bashed it from the get go and then all the people followed suit...And for people to say the ending is predictible go watch any horror movie and you pretty much can predict It. I can see no way in the blue moon that Space Cowboys could get a higher rating than The Hollow Man, except for Star Power. And as far as my views i wouldnt go see 3 old timers anymore, I want the hottest stars in the world. and hottest isnt Eastwood, Sutherland, and Cromwell, the last time Eastwood made a good movie was like Dirty Harry, True Crime is the worst of all time and Deep Blue Sea With Sutherland was a complete joke. Bacon (Stir of Echoes) and Shue (Leaving Las Vegas) are two stars worthy of this role. But as usual like my friend Jenna told me if ""Brad Pitt"" would have played the role of Sebastian she would have went right away, just to see ""Certain Scenes"" that happened later in the movie. Sex and Invisibility sells as it shows that the hollow man reached number 1 at the box office and Space Cowboys had enough trouble selling tickets to go see it.. But this is always how it will be now of days, when was the last time that people wanted to see a true horror/sci fi movie? Ever since Freddy and Jason left the scene movies have gotten worse and worse.. we have Spice Girl movies now for the love of god ;) I can almost predict that 1/4 of the people who voted the movie lower and who have a dvd player, will buy the DVD when it comes out since they will show more about the special effects and delete scenes from the movie, possibly an Alternate Ending.... Any way you look at it The Hollow Man Hit # 1 on the Box Office so it proves that people wanted to see this movie, this movie will continue it's reign and dethrown the Sixth Sense as best movie that has come out of August in Along time!",Hollow Man
458,newengguy,First-rate sci-fi flick.,9,6 August 2000,"Andrew Marlowe's tight script for Hollow Man neatly uses the conventions of the mad-scientist genre while providing smart dialogue.  Paul Verhoeven's direction throughout is imaginative, innovative, and provocative.  The entire lively cast delivers exciting performances with Elisabeth Shue and Kevin Bacon cleverly matched in the leading roles.  Allan Cameron's sharp production design is the  backdrop for dazzling special effects, Jost Vacano's brilliant photography, and Jerry Goldsmith's outstanding score. The innovative, visionary (also underrated, misunderstood) Paul Verhoeven has created another thrilling picture taking the conventions of the genre to a new technical high.",Hollow Man
459,angiegal,Waste of time & money,2,4 August 2000,"Almost walked out several times.  I can't think of any redeeming qualities about this movie, except that it does eventually end.  The story was predictable and often stupid.  There was way too much pointless gore and nudity.",Hollow Man

But for what it is, it's not too bad.",Hollow Man
463,del33,Lame,1,11 August 2000,This movie was lame.  The plot was tired and very predictible.  The special effects were good but that can't make up for the awful dialogue.  Its like predator of terminator only the guy is reguler just that know one can see him.  I mean want so cool about being invisible if they can see you with their glasses on.  I mean why didn't they just spray paint him so they would never loose track of him.  Waste of time you will laugh at the suspense scenes.,Hollow Man

A quite promessing plot, with a lot of possibilities that are wasted by keeping 95 per cent of the action inside the lab complex. It resembles the original (and fabulous) ""Alien"" movie in many aspects. Too many bad movies have used the same line since its release 22 years ago. The way the main character loses sanity is not well explained, occuring too quickly. The director could have tried to make the audience feel some empathy for the ""monster"". He simply is ridiculously bad. The FX are brilliant, tough.",Hollow Man

When my aunt made me watch this movie i thought it was going to be really boring but when i watched it it wasn't so bad i loved and i will watch it over and over and over again but i haven't seen it in a while but i will watch it again some day.

It's one of those landmark style flicks that sets a precedent for other films in the SFX arena. The only thing I would like to have seen more of would have been the main character spend more time outside the lab and in the general public.

474,rosseter101,A good idea ruined by a predictable ending,4,10 February 2001,"A movie that starts off with a familiar sci-fi premise, scientists have discovered how to make people invisible. The trick that makes this movie bearable to watch (if at all) is that they (the scientific team) don't know how to ""undo"" their magic. But was the movie gets about halfway through, it degrades into a type 1A horror flick. The invisible man doesn't want to be ""uninvisible"" while the rest of the team desperately wants to be able to know where he is  because of course, he's killing them off, one by one. Basically the ending can be seen from ""far away"" and Elisabeth Shue delivers her worst performance to date. Recommendation - Do not rent.",Hollow Man

This movie reflects what I call ""pigism.""  Yes, if we were invisible we would play tricks on people, maybe sneak-a-peak here and there but I'm sure the normal person would not commit murder or rape. The ""Kevin Bacon Game"" stops short of this one folks; the plot sucks and the security that the pentagon adheres to in this movie is horses**t.  Thumbs down, please don't waste your time.Clay S.

It starts really good, decent plot but at some point it becomes so dumb. If you respect your time you should avoid it, stop in the middle and better go out have a beer. What disappointed me the most is how stupid some scenes are. I'll list them then go on with my life: so if you have a restricted area, that you can get to only with an elevator, that you must type and spell your password, would that elevator have an escape unsecured door at the top just in case you are chased by someone with a flamethrower? I don't think so. If you are trapped in a freezer at -50 degrees, how in the world would you have electricity in there? Say you can't break the above freezer door window with a wrench, but being a women gives you the strength to break a steel bar like a toothpick. And by the way, secured facility elevators can be released, when hanging, just by pressing with your foot on some detacher. These are just a few, if you get the patience to watch it you'll most probably get disgusted. This is one of the worst movies I've ever watched.",Hollow Man

The special effects were great, the cast was good, and the basic plot could have been used. The basic outline of the movie looked entertaining if not promising. Somehow Hollow Man turned out to be a complete waste of time. I attribute this to poor performances by the entire cast (except for the gorilla, she did ok) and the weak script. Kevin Bacon and Elisabeth Shue are both good actors and I have enjoyed them in other movies. In this movie, neither of them seemed to be into their roles. If they had had a decent script to work with it might have been different. Oh well. If you watch this movie, try to shut down the brain and enjoy the good effects.",Hollow Man

My favourite part in this movie is when he kills the tiger and the blood goes everywhere.This film probably was one of those films what nobody went to see as half way through it started to get a tad bit boring.My overall rating on this film is a 7/10 as most of it had good graphics with amazing realism towards it.Most people have rated it at a fairly good 5 but i think it was better than most of these so called ghost films that are meant to scare you to death.I hope i have helped you decide whether you like this film or not.Happy deciding,Hollow Man

I also loved the transition between Bacon at the beginning, as a passive sane scientist, to the end, were he became a bloodthirsty stalking murder. the only derogatory thing i have to say about this movie, was that the acting at the beginning could have been better, actually the acting throughout the entire movie could have had some improvements.",Hollow Man
