0,SnoopyStyle,original and fascinating and boring after ten minutes,4,1 January 2016,Oscar (Nathaniel Brown) and his sister Linda (Paz de la Huerta) live in Tokyo. He's a small time drug dealer. His friend Alex (Cyril Roy) gives him The Tibetan Book of the Dead about the Buddhist belief in the afterlife. Oscar goes to a club called The Void. They are raided by the police. He holds out in the bathroom trying to flush his drugs and is shot through the door. His spirit rises out of his body and witnesses his life.This gets boring after about ten minutes. The bright colors and Japanese location are visually interesting with the first person POV. It is so hypnotic that it almost puts me to sleep. This is strictly experimental and not for the wider audience. I don't know how anybody is expected to sit through the over two hours unless they're actually on something.,Enter the Void
1,kosmasp,(visual) Trip,8,30 December 2010,"The movie is really long and might feel like it never ends too. But apart from the fact, that I thought it would have ended earlier (I knew how it would end, I just imagined it to be an earlier scene), there was only one other scene that I might have felt better if it would have been shorter. It's the very first visual trip we see after a few minutes into the film. It almost looks like a screen-saver. And I am not really a big fan of that in movies.But then again, it's not about where the movie ends up being, but how it gets there. Very visual and very first person, this might feel very dizzy and like with Irreversible (you get overhead shots until you break ... you won't yearn for more I reckon though) it feels like long shots pasted together.The other thing of course is the fact, that Noe is very explicit. He will not hold back (though there are some effects that will diffuse one or two scenes) on violence and or sex. Be aware of that, because he does not care if you think it is good taste or not. There is also quite a few moments that will shock you ... An experience you have to make, if you feel up for it.",Enter the Void
2,Quinoa1984,Over-heads.,7,12 August 2010,"For certain directors, a project may gestate for a while, such as Inception, which Nolan said took eight years, or Tarantino's 'Basterds' a decade. For Gaspar Noe, he tops them all, with his film being worked on and re-tooled over the course of *twenty* years. This goes without saying that some of this was based around waiting for the proper visual effects; Enter the Void has so many shots that are done with CGI and with a kind of vfx-led camera approach that it's hard to count what is ""really"" shot and what was done on a computer. But this doesn't take away from what works about Noe's first film since Irreversible. No, there are other things to take away that don't work. In terms of artistic ambition and a deranged glee at keeping the audience on a hook for 'what will happen next', Noe goes to take the cake for the year - yes, even more than Nolan's mind-trip. This is such a mind-trip that it could give regular trippers a run for their head- shop money. And this all isn't hyperbole: this is a true drug movie, where a viewer is taken along on a character's journey - if it even is a character at all - and the psychedelic atmosphere created in Tokyo. As far as the plot goes, there is either very little of it or a lot of it. It starts with Oscar (Nathanial Brown), who is a drug dealer, leaving his apartment he shares with his sister, Linda (Paz de la Huerta), and meeting his buyer, some young kid. But when he's set up, and, supposedly, is shot by the cops in the bathroom - this is not a spoiler inasmuch as this is the start of the movie pretty much - he's dead... but then the rest of the movie goes on, and we see still from the first-person POV that the film started on continue. The difference is that now the POV angle keeps cascading and flying in the air, almost always getting over-head angles on characters talking across rooms and skylines and buildings. There is still more story for Noe to tell, however. Oscar and Linda's back-story, for one, is given some great depth (still that first-person POV angle, only shot from behind Brown's head instead of his eyes). It's an extremely sad tale, almost too tragic to call melodrama, as Oscar and Linda go from a relatively happy childhood to their parents dying in a head-on collision with themselves in the backseat, and Linda being sent to a foster home away from Oscar. They reconnect when they're adults in Tokyo, and are all they have left in the world - that is until drugs and stripping get in the way, as well as a sub-plot involving a local British woman and her son who is also deep into drugs.In terms of the story itself, Noe actually has a firmly constructed and at least mostly cohesive tale to tell. It's in the way he goes about it that will makes one's head spin. Make no mistake, this is an ""art"" film, or an experimental film or what have you. For those who found Inception too 'Hollywood' or possibly too straightforward, then come and get it. The real confounding sense of Noe's cinema comes forth in those pirouetting shots, which sometimes seem to be all of one single shot but in fact are probably many (they're separated by shots that literally dive into 'things' like a light or a plant or, at one disturbing moment, a fetus on a table). It's kind of staggering to see this control and exhilaration in many of these shots, taking into account the hyper- realistic settings in rooms and streets of Tokyo, and the electric- lights and psychedelia brought around by drugs. Early on Noe gets the audience right into the swing of it (not counting credits) with Oscar's trip with DMT: one may feel as if they're in a combination of fractals, that screen-saver on the Windows Media Player, and a legitimate drug trip. But this is only the start of shots and angles and scenes that play out sometimes over simply a bright white or yellow light. While this holds the attention for the first two thirds of the film, when it goes on and on in that last half hour or so (I wasn't sure how long and was at least attentive not to check a watch), it drags on and becomes tedious. It's hard to say exactly where to cut, though Noe reportedly has a ""shorter"" cut than the uncut 160 minute version. But for all of the deranged fun in seeing such a conceptual style executed, and always in mind with it being possibly a floating consciousness or just a super-extended drug trip (or both), it wears thin, even with the excess nudity and sex at the ""Love Hotel"" in the final reel.Enter the Void is a mixed bag of treasures and disappointments. Noe has so much going for him with his aesthetic that he almost neglects his actors. De la Huerta (previously all-nude in The Limits of Control) shows how well she can act here, and helps give a deep reservoir of emotional heft in the scenes that need it. And supporting actors and characters, such as the French drug-friend and that little guy Victor, all do what they can to make scenes more dramatically powerful than they have any right to be given the style over substance. But when both come together, it's truly amazing, and occasionally brilliant stuff, such as the repeated shock of the car crash or (some of) the up-front sex. It's like a remake of Requiem for a Dream by a film student in love with the over-head roaming shots from Minority Report. It's depressing, fun, dull, high and with an ending that is just pure WTF. Cult film fans rejoice!",Enter the Void
3,LeonLouisRicci,Warning: For Brave and Artificially Bewitched Viewers Only,6,13 September 2012,"An uneasy Blend of Mysticism and Sex. Overlong and Self Indulgent Study of Hallucinatory Drugs and Afterlife affairs of the Spirit. This is a very Vibrant Visual account of a possible Post-Death Experience that is presented in a Stylized, if Saturated, Trip that recalls other Films. It has a Muddled Message filled with Pornographic pictures and heavy handed Symbolism.Some are downright Unwatchable and belong Nowhere in Artful Entertainment, that recall so called ""Educational"" Exploitation Health Films of the Pre-Porn Era. We had the ""See a Real Birth"" Films and here is a ""See a Realistic Abortion"" that is completely Out of place in a Movie that is supposedly about Other Dimensional Realms and filled with Pastoral Imagery. The contrast is too Stark to make a Statement other than ""We will now take bad taste to a new level."".There is so Much that is Rich and Thoughtful going on that, Unfortunately, is Overwhelmed by some Over the Top Contrariness. It is all for Naught except to be Naughty. It is the Bonding of Two Films from Two Directions that is Insoluble and Insufferable. It's like Submerging a Crucifix in Urine and calling it Art. If that's Your Idea of Cutting Edge Expressionism, You may find this Film Successful.The Wonderful Stimulating Colors and quite Extraordinary Fluid Design are a Sensational Experience, but this comes at a very Heavy Price.

4,dbborroughs,I hope the shorter American release version has less of the back and forth flying sequences because they utterly stop the film dead.,3,12 August 2010,"I saw the NY premiere of the directors cut last night and all I can say is I was extremely disappointed.This is the story of Oscar, who along with his sister Linda are living in Tokyo. While Linda goes off to her job as stripper Oscar stays home to get stoned. When his friend Victor calls wanting his share of the drugs that they are to sell together Oscar goes off to The Void bar, Unfortunately Victor has set Oscar up and he ends up dead. From that point on we watch as Oscar looks over his life and friends from the other side.Told in a POV style (with an annoying blink during the living scenes) we see everything from Oscars POV. This allows for some trippy visuals as we see what he does during his drug trip. Some of this material is some of the most amazing visuals put on film and it needs to be seen on a big screen. Unfortunately we also get seemingly endless shots of flying over the city, through walls, over roofs, down every street that Oscar travels going from place to place. The monotony is of it is deadening especially at a length that is 20 minutes short of three hours.As a fan of the director I have admired his ability to shock his audience and to make us think. Unfortunately his power to shock is missing as the most jarring scenes are the ones that repeatedly show a loud violent car crash. The shock comes from the noise and not the image or ideas. Indeed even an abortion and a lots of graphic sex fail to get a rise because they are weakly handled.(actually the sex with its glowing genitals had some of the people around me laughing hysterically) Noe's ability to make his audience think is also gone with most of the points about the cycle of rebirth and Oedipal desires in sex being unoriginal and seeming to have come from a highlight postcard of interesting ideas and a fudged synopsis of the Tibetan Book of the Dead.In fairness to Noe, had the film not been so long, thanks to the endless travel sequences, this might have been a great film, but the over length and monotonous imagery sink the film. (I'm hopeful that the shorter American version actually corrects this.) If you have any interest in the film do see it on a big movie screen since the visuals, which are often amazing, will be best served. (And the opening credits will knock your socks off. The audience last night gave them a sustained ovation) Personally This is an interesting misfire that has left me wondering if Noe has lost his ability to really tell a story since all his films since Irreversible have been severely lacking.Almost a good movie.",Enter the Void
5,gridoon2021,"A brilliant film, if a bit too long and indulgent",8,17 June 2018,"For more than 90 minutes, I flirted with the idea of giving ""Enter The Void"" the first perfect 10 on this site that I would have ever given to a movie (I have rated some specific TV episodes ""10""). Words simply cannot describe the experience: it is astonishing, immersive, transcendental - a ""legal high"". Gaspar Noe's floating camera is like a magic carpet carrying you along. But around the point where the flashbacks chronicling Oscar's past end, the film starts to get a little too indulgent, and I could see the ending coming a mile away. Despite all that, a trip like no other. *** out of 4.",Enter the Void
6,zetes,"Phantasmagoric flick, pretty much unlike anything else you've ever seen",9,30 January 2011,"The closest equivalent, I think, is the director's previous film, Irreversible. I thought that one was actually slightly better, but this one is quite fabulous itself. It involves a drug dealer who is killed in a police raid. Most of the film is from the point of view of his spirit as it observes the aftermath of his death, as well as visits to his own past. The camera glides over the action like a fly on the wall (the first section of the film is totally in first person, like the infamous film noir Lady in the Lake, and even includes bits of darkness when the protagonist blinks (which is, I admit, extremely annoying)). Paz de la Huerta plays his gorgeous sister. She may not be a great actress, but she's some great eye candy. The big problem with this film is that the story and characters are pretty uninteresting. The protagonist, played by Nathaniel Brown (who is obviously rarely seen on camera), is pretty much a drug-peddling dillhole and you couldn't care less that he's dead. But I think the experimental nature of the film is so thrilling that the film becomes something truly special. Now, if Noé had come up with some better characters and story (because I do love the bizarre way in which it's told), he might have had a masterpiece on his hands. As it is, it's a must-see.",Enter the Void
7,trashgang,another masterpiece from Gaspar Noé,9,28 September 2015,"Enter The Void was for me another revelation coming out of the hand of Gaspar Noé. After seen the shocking Irreversible (2002) I thought that would be his masterpiece but he did it again. And again this isn't going to be a flick to watch for people who are easily offended or doesn't understand arty flicks.It never becomes brutal as Irreversible did in the rape scene and with the fire extinguisher but the shocking lays in the fact that it contains an abortion scene and it's not for the squeamish. Paz de la Huerta does lay wide spread and fully naked while they are entering her vagina to destroy the foetus. All filmed in full glory. And Paz goes naked a lot or is doing a strip act, even that can be shocking for some. But not only that, towards the end we enter a love hotel and that's just on the edge of a porn flick. Only the cum is excluded. If you can see through all that then you will open your mouth towards editing and the use of bright colors, and the way things were shot were so well done. The first minutes for example it's all done in POV of the drug addict and we do get into his trip too. And have a look how the car accident was done, and the daughter shouting it out. There's not much of explanation of the story itself, you just watch and try to get it. A weird flick but a classic indeed.

8,deloudelouvain,Weird psychedelic movie,6,15 December 2015,"Now this movie is not for everyone to watch. Some will love it, but a lot of people will just hate it. My wife absolutely hated it. I didn't hate it nor did I love it. I am a big fan of Gaspar Noé's Seul Contre Tous (I stand alone) so I was expecting a little bit of weirdness but not that much. Because during the whole movie it's like you are on an acid trip. Psychedelic, weird or unreal, it certainly is not going to be for everybody's taste. The story itself was way too long for me and not very entertaining. The thing I liked was the way of filming, it's all very hypnotizing. Even though it was too long for me I still got sucked into the movie. But if you have to watch something from Gaspar Noé then I recommend you I Stand Alone.",Enter the Void
9,HumanoidOfFlesh,Entering the Void with Tibetian Book of the Dead.,8,15 January 2011,"The Tibetian Book of the Dead is traditionally believed to be the work of the legendary Padma Sambhava in the 8th century A.D.The book acts as a guide for the dead during the state that intervenes death and the next rebirth.He is considered to be one of the first persons to bring Buddhism to Tibet.The Bardo Thodol is a guide that is read aloud to the dead while they are in the state between death and reincarnation in order for them to recognize the nature of their mind and attain liberation from the cycle of rebirth.""Enter the Void"" by Gaspar Noe plays like a stunning dramatization of The Tibetian Book of the Dead with damaged and drug-fueled characters,violence and raw sex.Oscar reads the book before he is killed and his soul wanders among his tragic childhood past and neon Tokyo present time.The trippy and delirious camera-work is amazing as is hypnotic soundtrack.Another bleak and nihilistic assault from Gaspar Noe.8 out of 10.",Enter the Void
10,StevePulaski,Makes a universe out of a microcosm,7,15 February 2016,"NOTE: This film was recommended to me by Tyler Plachy for ""Steve Pulaski Sees It."" Gaspar Noé's Enter the Void is an unfathomable sensory overload, and unlike most experimental works that adopt a strong visual scheme with graphic content and polarizing nudity, it doesn't feel an obligation to tell its story briefly so that you return to your former start of contentment or comfort. In fact, it does the opposite and persists on for over two and a half hours, and by the end of it, you're left exhausted, mentally fried, and as if you just experienced a crippling drug trip like the lead character in the film.The film follows Oscar (Nathaniel Brown), a young man who lives in Tokyo with his younger sister Linda (Paz de la Huerta) and makes ends meet by dealing drugs. The opening scenes get the audience closely involved with our lead character like few films ever do; Noé makes Oscar's point-of-view our point-of-view, complete with abrupt camera movements to indicate rapid head-movement and even frequent blinking to resemble even Oscar's most unconscious actions. We're flooded by the sounds and internalized thoughts that circulate through Oscar's head throughout the night, as he wastes away getting high and hallucinating as he roams the streets of Tokyo.Oscar has also become fascinated with The Tibetan Book of the Dead, a Buddhist book of beliefs about the afterlife and reincarnation, thanks to his best friend Alex (Cyril Roy). This book carries itself throughout the film, as Oscar, and the audience as a result, plunges deep into his psyche to uncover ideas, memories, and thoughts he never knew he had. We see Oscar and his sister recount memories from their childhood, as well as how Oscar moved out to Tokyo and got involved in the drug dealing business at the expense of himself and his sister, whom he promised he'd protect his entire life.Enter the Void, given how long it is, manages to be incredibly lucid and dreamlike for most of its runtime. Never does Noé rush himself; he takes time to craft and present, as he constructs other-worldly, neon-soaked landscapes that make Vegas look like it's lit by just a few neon signs, and presents them with a wide variety of intricate camera angles (particularly high-overhead shots that have the camera look as if it's positioned on the ceiling pointing directly down on the characters). The variety of angles and techniques employed to give us this kind of lucid, almost transient experience since the film is captured in something resembling a vignette-style, makes the entire experience feel like a dream with its replication of the randomness of the mind at rest. If nothing else, it sure evokes the nonsense level of your average dream, as well.With that, Benoît Debie's cinematography does everything to make us forget that we're currently viewing a place on Earth. The inexplicable use of bright, neon colors and hallucinatory patterns that look as if they're tie-dye patterns and tessellations come to life. Debie creates a film that, while at times is visually dark and dingy, still simultaneously feels bright and vibrant, and with Noé's limitless ambition taking over the project at every turn, Debie is tasked with doing ostensibly much more than the average cinematographer normally has to do to make a vision come to life.Nonetheless, the meticulous craft pays off because Enter the Void is a mesmerizing work visually. In terms of its narrative, the film is predicated upon impressionistic standards of interpretation, meaning that you can subscribe to its story, its characters, and its imagery whatever you perceive as being fit with its content, save for maybe the core themes of the project, such as the barbaric and often loveless representations of sex. Because of this film being both minimalist and particularly constructed, a particularly strange dichotomy exists where Enter the Void, in some respects, is easy to define, and in others, cruelly difficult. The film, while overlong, sometimes repetitive, and more than likely to wear on most brave souls who choose to view it, still asserts itself as a piece you cannot ignore, at least for long.Noé makes Enter the Void operate in the strangest, most far-out category of weirdness that I can think of, and the overall effect the film merits is equal parts haunting as it is mesmerizing, and the result is anything but coherent. Often maddening, sometimes meandering, but undeniably original and topical, especially as it delves into the idea of a human psyche being ravaged by prolific drug use and the carnality and temporal nature of sexual behavior, Enter the Void magnifies the tiny microcosm it fashions for itself and expands it into creating an epic film that ostensibly crafts its own universe.Starring: Nathaniel Brown and Paz de la Huerta.

11,KineticSeoul,Brilliant and astonishing with really trippy visuals,8,4 March 2011,"This must be a very difficult movie to shoot, because it's in first person view in most of it through and there is no scene change or cut to other views in a lot of parts during the running time so it must have been crucial that no one makes any mistakes. These are qualities that has been done in other movies but still in a way nothing I have ever seen before. And must have been difficult to execute and pull off. This is a very trippy movie, in fact people that might have a seizure over flashing lights may want to avoid seeing this movie. Might miss out on seeing a awesome movie, but if it's worth having a seizure over, I say go for it. The camera work in this movie is truly amazing for the most part and it's a captivating movie and ballsy at the same time. japan is a good choice for this movie because it's a city with the vibe and flashing lights that makes the scenery look even more trippy. The movie is basically about death and existence and about a man's journey into how everything went wrong in chronological order. And has a lot to do with out of body experience chronological order death and existence while dealing with death and existence. The visuals in this movie is crazy and it's sort of like a roller coaster ride and the shock factor is done pretty well. The approach and direction to this movie is very original and different kind of movie, and seemed like it's going for the experience than anything else.8.6/10",Enter the Void
12,Hellmant,I actually feel like my life is worse off for watching it!,3,19 January 2011,"'ENTER THE VOID': One and a Half Stars (Out of Five) This psychedelic afterlife tale is meant to play like a drug experience, as if you were on drugs while viewing it, and it sort of does but it's way too long and over indulgent. It probably would be better if the viewer is high while watching it but it would still get pretty boring I'd imagine. It's directed by French filmmaker Gaspar Noe (who also directed the critically acclaimed 'IRREVERSIBLE') and co-written by Noe and Lucile Hadzihalilovic. It stars Nathaniel Brown, Paz de la Huerta and Cyril Roy and despite the fact the movie is French it's filmed all in English (with a little Japanese). The director says he filmed the movie in English so viewers would focus more on the spectacular visuals, rather than subtitles (catering to America of course above all others), allowing only dubbed tracks in other countries. The film is well over two and a half hours long (at least the version I saw) and it's relentless. Although some of the visuals are amazing the film as a whole is depressing and wasteful.The story is set primarily in Tokyo and is told completely through one person's perspective, a drug dealing and drug addicted American teenager named Oscar (Brown). He's killed early on in the film and his ghost appears to rise from his body and travel around the world, back and forth in time witnessing events that take place to his friends and loved ones. He mostly watches over his sister Linda (Huerta) who he had a special bond with since childhood when their parents were killed in a horrific car crash (which is shown excessively in the film). They were separated through foster care but vowed to reunite as they did in Tokyo where they lived together; he as a drug dealer and she as a stripper / prostitute. The director says the film is not really about a teen who gets shot and lives on as a ghost but is in fact about someone who gets stoned and then shot and ""has an intonation of his own dream"", after reading 'The Tibetan Book of the Dead'.I admire the creativeness of the film and it's originality but the movie is so excessive in almost every way and pointless, for the most part. It has that cool drug effect and might become a cult classic to get stoned to but I expect a lot more from a film. There's some character development and some decent acting, especially from Huerta, but the lead is only ever seen from behind and this hurts what little development there actually is for his character, so the viewer never really learns to care for him. The film tries really hard to shock the viewer at almost every turn but most of it is done in really poor taste and it's just plain exploitation film making, which I don't have a problem with but here it's pretty disgusting and when a film pretends to have a point and or some meaning like this (and it doesn't) it makes it that much more repulsive. The movie is somewhat of a technical achievement but it is all style over substance and it's equally visually disturbing (and insulting) as it is appealing. It's a bad film, despite some of the rave reviews you might have heard (like from Quentin Tarantino).

13,StrictlyConfidential,Enter Into This Braindead Void At Your Own Risk!,1,18 July 2020,"Yep. Just another piece of copy-cat, shaky, hand-held-camera garbage.Absolutely terrible.The main character spends far too much time just staring like a brain-dead vegetable at a boring ceiling in his tiny, squalid flat.... Duh!Not in the least bit interesting. Totally worthless.",Enter the Void
14,MOscarbradley,"Repellent and what's worse, boring.",1,17 October 2018,"Quite early on in Gaspar Noe's ""Enter the Void"" an addict smokes what I presumed to be crack and Noe's camera interprets for us the images that he might be experiencing, a kind of swivelling red gaseous mass, at first frighteningly tactile and then more soothingly diaphanous. Never having taken crack myself I still have no reason to doubt that this is probably what it's like and you think if anyone's going to give us an accurate picture of what taking drugs is like, then it will be Noe.Unfortunately Noe is a filmmaker whose desire to experiment with all forms of film and whose desire to shock means he is in constant danger of alienating his audience. There are people who worship at his altar and who have hailed ""Enter the Void"" as his masterpiece but for me the technical brilliance on display doesn't make up for the bad acting and lousy dialogue. Great tracking shots and stunning cinematography are all very well but there is no-one on screen you can relate to and the innane things they say are painful to listen to, (I might have liked it more had it been silent), and in ""Enter the Void"" we have to listen to them and watch them for close on three hours.The very flimsy plot has something to do with a Tokyo sex club and bar, The Void, where our drug-smoking protagonist meets his end, again very early in the picture, but who lives on as a kind of ghostly narrator for the rest of the film as he takes us on a long tour of his life and world. The film would be clever if it weren't so banal and the imagery is more likely to induce a migrane or a seizure. If the violence on this occasion is minimal, (at least for for Noe), the film is still no less repellent and a lot more boring than ""Irreversible"".",Enter the Void
15,A_Different_Drummer,Gaspar Noé is Crazy ... Not That That is a Bad Thing...,10,28 November 2013,"The fact that I have to dig deep into the Collected Philosophical Works of Jerry Seinfeld to even begin to explain this director tells you that this reviewer might be out of his depth trying to explain this film. Gaspar Noé is clearly one of the most original directors working in our lifetime and, depending on whom you listen to, and which reviews you read, he may or may not be a genius. He is however a certified ""enfant terrible"" of the medium, which is not exactly the same thing. No review of his work can be complete without mentioning that this is the man behind IRREVERSIBLE, not simply the only mainstream film in history (as far as I am aware) which is presented to the viewer in completely reverse order, but one which presents one of the most brutal rapes ever filmed. In other words, this is not a director who will bend ""to convention"" when he has the opportunity to bend convention to his own will. That said, I found this strange tale of a young ex-pat in Japan who gets in over his head and is murdered, then has to adjust to being ""astrally"" present in the lives of his wayward sister (and others) for a period, to be nothing less than mesmerizing and hypnotic and basically unforgettable. (Let me riff off the notion of ""unforgettable"" for a moment -- EVEN IF I WANTED TO FORGET THIS FILM, I could not, that is the kind of impression it made.) The stars are mainly unknowns but, OMG, the theme of death and transition is so archetypal, so much a part of our DNA, and the direction is so sure-footed and unrelenting, that the film ultimately has more in common with a theme park ride THAT YOU CAN'T GET OFF than simple entertainment. Nothing like it to compare it too. One of a kind.",Enter the Void

17,Bored_Dragon,1/10 and 10/10 at the same time...,8,26 October 2016,"This movie should be watched on hallucinogens in the dark of movie theater. Unfortunately, I had to watch it on my computer while eating chicken wings. In the first case I would probably rate it 10, but completely straight I could not avoid being irritated by all its flaws.The idea is great, the story well developed, although told in a completely twisted way typical for Gaspar Noe. Camera and photography are works of genius, use of colors and strobe, bird's-eye view, unbelievable visual adventure. Though, epileptics and those with hypersensitive eyes should definitely avoid this ride or at least watch it in bright light. You risk a serious headache because, as much as it is beautiful, it is also very heavy for eyes.Unfortunately, it seems that Noe got into it too deep and lost control after a while. The movie is unnecessarily too long. Scenes of tripping on hallucinogens last five to ten times longer than it would be humane towards the audience. Also, astral flights, between every two scenes Oscar is watching, are too slow and too long. If he cut all of that in half, the movie wouldn't lose any of its meaning or visual poetics, but it would be cut down from almost three hours to under two hours and he would avoid the danger of having half of the audience leaving the theater before the movie ends.This movie definitely isn't for a mainstream audience. It is too long, too confusing, very explicit in showing drugs and sex, and extremely tiring for eyes. But although I was at the edge of giving up in the first half an hour, the movie slowly pulled me in its world and then it gave me two more hours of hypnotizing ride.It is very hard for me to rate it. When I have to force myself to watch it till the end, I give it 1/10 or maybe 2/10, depending on the successfulness of that forcing. And when a movie gives me such an amazing ride like this one did and leaves me under strong impressions, it is usually 9/10 or 10/10. But this is the first time I saw a movie that meets both criteria. Still, despite all the flaws, I think this movie is worth more than it seems at first glance.!!! SPOILER ALERT !!!At the very beginning of the film, when they mentioned reincarnation and explained how exactly it works and looks like, I instantly knew how this movie will end. And to be honest, it would be stupid to end it any differently. Although, I would make a slight change in it. I would reincarnate Oscar into his own incest child. Somehow it seems to me that movie this sick has to end even sicker. :D8/10",Enter the Void
18,tomgillespie2002,Dazzling visuals that aren't enough to sustain a 160+ minute running time,4,23 July 2011,"Oscar (Nathaniel Brown) is a small-time drug-taker and dealer living in the neon-lit Tokyo. The film begins with him tripping out on DMT as he relaxes in his apartment, only for him to be called to make a drop off for Victor (Olly Alexander). He makes the journey to a bar called The Void with his friend Alex (Cyril Roy), and they discuss the Tibetan Book of the Dead, which Alex has loaned Oscar. Upon arrival at the bar, it is clear that Victor has set him up, and the police chase Oscar in the toilet, only to shoot him dead. Oscar rises out of his body, reflects on his early life, his separation and eventual reuniting with his sister Linda (Paz De La Huerta), who is now with him in Japan, and how the people around him deal with his death.Back in 2002, when I was approaching 18, I was dealt a sledgehammer blow to the face with Gaspar Noe's Irreversible. The film was horrifying and almost unwatchable, yet at the same time it was beautiful and brilliant. That film almost single-handedly started my interest and fascination with extreme cinema. It was disappointing that I had to wait seven years for his next feature, Enter The Void, and even more disappointing that it is a relatively poor film compared to the brilliance of Irreversible, a film I felt was one of the best film of that year.Much like Irreversible, Enter The Void is outstanding to look at. While the former made the most of it's loose, kaleidoscopic camera-work, Void does much of the same, but takes that experience and amplifies it a thousand per cent. The opening half an hour uses a POV shot, where we not only see what Oscar sees, but hear what he thinks and experience his quite beautiful drug trip. After he is shot, the camera develops a mind of its own, flying across town to see what other friends are doing, zooming into gun shot wounds, into dreams, and even inside a vagina to see a seed being planted. It really is an experience like no other, and takes voyeurism to a whole other level.Yet, for all its technical brilliance, Enter The Void left me cold. Noe is undoubtedly a self-styled provocateur, but where Irreversible had a point to make behind all the on-screen horror (Time Destoys Everything), this film seems to have nothing to say. Yes, it's about re-birth and the body's spirit leaving the body after death, but it's not enough to sustain the 160 minute running time. It's not a particularly pleasant experience watching Oscar's sister Linda (the brilliant Paz De La Huerta, who was the best thing in HBO's relatively disappointing Boardwalk Empire) strip for sleazebags, struggle to deal with the death of her brother, and have an abortion (which we have the pleasure of experiencing). By the 2 hour mark, the visual were not enough to keep my interest and I genuinely struggled during the last stretch.Gaspar Noe will still remain a director whose work I will look forward to and eagerly track down, but I hope he puts his genuine talent into something else rather than to merely torturing the audience. His early film Seul Contre Tous (I Stand Alone) was a Taxi Driver-esque portrayal of an angry old man tortured by the overwhelming anger he feels for the world. It was certainly interesting, but again it was an extremely unpleasant experience. I wish I could have seen Enter The Void at the cinema to feel the full force of that soundtrack and colour, but I think I still would have found it an empty film. Worth seeing for the visuals alone, and for the outstanding opening credits which are possibly the most dazzling I've ever seen.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",Enter the Void
19,Floated2,A Visually stunning Experience,6,13 August 2014,"Enter the Void tells the story in the perspective of Oscar (Nathaniel Brown), a young American drug dealer. He first goes to the bar of the film's title, is then shot dead in a police raid and embarks on an extended out-of-body experience. He sees his past, and eventually his future life, during which he was separated from his sister Linda (Paz de la Huerta). She arrives in Japan as a stripper, has an abortion and attempts suicide before giving birth to the child of his friend Alex (Cyril Roy), who is apparently Oscar's reincarnated self.The film contains some shock and may bore others. The first half of the film is refreshing then it somewhat drags on heavily. However the technical fluency with which this Freudian spectacle is made is undeniable, including a CGI evocation of an acid trip, and impressions of a baby emerging from the womb and immediately sucking its mother's nipple. Running at 161 minutes, Enter the Void isn't for everyone.",Enter the Void

22,I_Ailurophile,"No thumbs up or down, just one big shrug",3,2 January 2021,"I don't think 'Enter the Void' is an altogether bad concept. And it's not that it's executed poorly, per se. I just don't think it's interesting enough to bother with in the first place.Maybe I just don't have enough of a finely developed eye to appreciate arthouse films. Yet this strikes me as that really fantastic idea someone had while they were super high, and once they sobered up, they followed through on that vision to the very letter. Is this is a movie that one needs to be under the influence of recreational drugs to appreciate? Is it an instance of something I ""just don't get?"" Is it an example of an idea conjured under the influence that, like many such ideas, are unfortunately not actually that great?Sex, violence, and drug use in a film should at least propel a narrative, if it doesn't elicit an actual reaction, good or bad. But watching this, I felt nothing. Am I supposed to appreciate the things happening on screen just because they are happening on screen, in a work of cinematic art? There are plenty of shots in movies with conventional narratives that evoke an emotional reaction, even independent of the story. I can appreciate lighting, costumes, photography, all those little things of which films are comprised. So why does 'Enter the Void' just feel so empty?I suppose it says something that even though it's been years since I've watched this, I still remember it fairly well, if incompletely, and think about it for no particular reason. But for the life of me, despite the (somewhat surprising) positive reviews, I don't know why I should care about this movie.Possibly worth watching if you really, really like drugs (absolutely no judgment if you do -to each their own), or if you like art just because someone says it is art, or maybe even if you're just really curious. But the whole thing is, I can't think of any other reason why this is a movie to recommend this to anyone.",Enter the Void
23,Jonny_Numb,Null and Void,4,6 March 2011,"With each film, director Gaspar Noe aims to provoke, disorient, and even violate the viewer in some way; as a result, one gets the impression that he invites the vitriol of those who would slam his cinematic vision. Now, while I was compelled (if not ""entertained"") by the near-pornographic subjectivity of Noe's ""I Stand Alone"" (the tale of a sociopath butcher wandering around France with a whole lot of pent-up anger) and ""Irreversible"" (a backwards-unraveling tale of revenge and rape), ""Enter the Void"" is an agonizingly overlong tale of death and the Afterlife that mistakes neon-saturated, drug-trip informed imagery as a profound comment on a world beyond our own mortality. In its first half, ""Void"" manages to compel and intrigue, even if our grating and unsympathetic protagonists (a brother-and-sister duo living in Japan as a drug dealer and a stripper, respectively) do very little to make all the flashy neon seem like more than aesthetic window-dressing. At 90 minutes, ""Void"" is a passable (if largely empty) film, but as it crawls towards the 3-hour mark, it becomes obnoxious, intolerable, and infuriating (with Noe's pretentious excesses -- culminating in a literal orgy -- becoming the stuff of yawns rather than gasps).",Enter the Void
24,p-stepien,Drifting in oblivion. With pizazz.,4,23 May 2014,"Gaspard Noe big bang return misfires with the ultimate clash of style over substance. When a young American drug dealer Oscar (Nathaniel Brown) inadvertently gets gunned down by trigger-happy policemen in downtown Tokyo, a concoction of drugs and sensory overload deliver an after-life experience like no other ever presented in cinema. As Oscar drifts out of his body we view the world through his mind's eye in a collage of flashbacks, flash-forwards and overall time anachronism that would make Terence Mallick green with envy. As we weightlessly venture over Tokyo we observe the lives of those left behind, like Oscar's long lost, recently found stripper sister Linda (Paz de la Huerta), whom he promised never to leave behind or view the ordeals of Alex (Cyril Roy), Oscar's best mate, now hectically on the run from police.Dispatching off traditional narrative ""Enter the Void"" is mesmeric trip floating over the city of Tokyo, fluorescing with bright neon colours, which underline the trippy nature of the entire concept. As such the cinematography is bold and brings about a weight of promise, which slowly sifts away with the exacerbating runtime of nearly three hours. Shockingly devoid of layered afterthought, instead delivering skin-deep existentialism, ""Enter the Void"" rings hollow with the concept of rebirth seemingly serving purely for exploitational purposes, such as the possibility to present a vagina's view of an ejaculation or a twenty minute voyeuristic ride into soft-porn, when Oscar decides to fly through the excessively graphic inner-goings of the Hotel Love.All in all Gaspard Noe seems to aim to project a concept that everything in life is about sex, even death. And then pursues every possible route to undress a female and provide for gratuitous nudity. This leads to unnecessary scenes of Linda peeing on an pregnancy test or having an abortion practically stark naked. Gaspard Noe seems to underline this notion when the movies culmination features sexual organs emanating a radiant angelic light. Even here Noe's focus is mind-numbingly simplistic, giving in to the most basic atavistic notions, such as sexualising breast feeding (with an uneasily eroticised presentation of sucking nipples by an infant) or strong hints of incest. This obsession knows no boundaries, even within the realm of the story itself (whatever fragmented presence of it there is). Within the confines of this ludicrous script the first thing a recently deceased Oscar does is venture to his sister to first observe her pole-dancing and then to get all orgasmic with her lover-employer.After a mostly intriguing opening the story soon dissipates inhibiting positive reception due to its uninvolving and wooden characters and tries to save face by going full frontal in increasingly shorter intervals. Fronted by impeccable artistry of cinematography ""Enter the Void"" is a treat for the eye and for the senses, but even the best concept will leave you numb sooner than later.Gaspard Noe's attempt to go full throttle 2001: Space Odyssey is to an extent a spellbinding and worthwhile mess of movie. Lacking in gravity, it nonetheless makes for required viewing that allows to discover new boundaries of film language and thus forward the concepts provided to make a movie that is actually something more than a pseudo-artistic dive into eroticism. Noe really should focus on his true calling and enter into an art-house porno-debate with Lars von Trier.",Enter the Void
25,Matt_Layden,Where to begin?,4,23 January 2011,"A drug addict dealer is killed in Japan and his soul leaves his body to look after his sister and revisit parts of his life. This was my best way of describing a film that is indescribable.Running at an overwhelming 161 minutes, Enter The Void asks a lot from the viewer. I don't expect the causal movie goer to enjoy or get this film, I'm having a hard time myself. I appreciate the film for the technical marvel that it is, it's visually pleasing and an interesting experiment in filmmaking, but the story, or lack there of, hurts it so much that it makes the film less enjoyable. Nathanial Brown plays Oscar, we only see him twice, both times he is looking at himself in the mirror. The rest of the time we see him, it's the back of his head. The entire film is from his point of view, literally. We see the world through his eyes, then we later see the world through his soul, which hovers over everyone. The camera work in this film is beautiful, it's always moving and you get the feel of weightlessness. The film jumps between timelines like it's nothing. We'll go from present day, to the past where the characters are kids, we even get a bit of the future. The film is striking, visually and it has an interesting musical tone to it. The neon theme that is present throughout the film is a nice attention grabber. If the beautiful visuals don't strike you, the bizarre content will. Abortion, sex, drugs, violence, gay sex, breast feeding, nudity, a vagina's view of a penis ejaculating inside of it. You read that last part right. These images are jolting and sometimes cringe worthy. I can't comment on the narrative structure, because all the film consists of is the character's soul watching everyone deal with his death and their lives. It doesn't really ask you to think about your existence or asks questions about life, it just presents one aspect of it. A weird one at that. The film looses the message it tried to convey because the excruciating long running time will have people checking their watch after the first hour and a half. Impressive visuals can only hold your attention for so long before you have to start asking where the hell the film is going or what it is trying to say. Maybe people will say that the film is style over substance, I agree. The film is not for everyone, I'll tell those who want to see an impressive and technically accomplished film to check this one out. I would advise those looking for a straight forward narrative to skip it. Enter The Void is cold and vibrant at the same time. It opens with the credits, flies past them like they mean nothing. So you know that the film does right up to the last minute of the run time. If you can find the symbolism, then congrats. I was struggling with this one at times. The death, re-birth aspect was lost to all the chaos that was before it. I can see where the director got his inspiration from, the polarizing film 2001: A Space Odyssey.The final 20 minutes of the film takes a soft core porn turn, where all the characters are having some sort of sexual interaction with another in the LOVE hotel. The lead character makes a comment earlier in the film about how cool would it be to be able to see inside the hotel and see everyone having sex. He then does this later while he is a ghost/soul thing. Enter The Void is something that I won't be bothered to remember days from now. I appreciate it and I loath it. It's one of those films.",Enter the Void
26,gizmomogwai,You may enter,8,21 April 2014,"I felt compelled to give this movie a shot after rewatching Blue Is the Warmest Colour (2013) so many times. This is the film Adele and her boyfriend are watching in the theatre. (You can hear a child ask ""And if you die?"" and another reply, ""I'll come back."") Although I heard this is an extreme movie, and am not all that interested in stories of drug dealers, that hint of creepy supernaturalism is intriguing.I was pleased and a little surprised that, although this is nothing like Blue Is the Warmest Colour, there is something to this film. It's trippy, and the opening credits came close to giving me Pokemon-style epileptic seizures, but this is definite thought behind what we're seeing and method to this madness. Enter the Void is an attempt to capture reincarnation, tied in with a story of two orphans, who promise each other that they'll always be together, no matter what. It's a story of immortality- with an ending reminiscent of 2001. Of course, this isn't G-rated material like 2001. Some stuff is hard to take; the boy cutting his sister's thumb is wince-worthy. The sex at the end is a bit much. But after seeing some of the film, I wanted to see more, and at the end have no regrets watching it.",Enter the Void
27,jaredmobarak,Did they hear me? Did I scream?  Enter the Void,8,19 September 2009,"Words can seriously not describe the visually rich and assaulting epic tale of death and its aftermath of memories and spiritual travel that is Gaspar Noé's Enter the Void. Self-proclaimed as ""weird"" by the director himself at it's World Premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival, (the print screened at Cannes was a work-in-progress), he says his attempt was to create a near death experience on film. So, with stunning imagery; fullscreen frames of solid bright color pulsating at epileptic seizure-inducing rates; extended moments of seamless cutting to make long passages appear to be one take; first person camera-work spliced from straight shots merging into fish-eye lens distortion; extreme close-ups, either computer generated or otherwise, appearing as though a fly filmed the entire thing while in flight; and just the maze-like electricity of downtown Tokyo at night, one must actually sit down and experience it, letting it wash over you, to fully appreciate the work. Noé is a genius of some kind, always on the fringes of the industry, appalling some, disgusting others, and written off by the rest, yet I can't genuinely say I'd recommend anyone seeing this movie. And therein lies the problem, if words can't describe it and I couldn't in good conscience send you to see it due to the extensive drug use, realistic sex scenes, and harrowing moments of graphic brutality, what else is there to do? It definitely is an important film to the industry, though, just in the technical prowess on display. Noé has an eye for cinema, utilizing who knows what for shots that I've never seen before. He said after the screening that a lot of post-production was necessary to craft every moment into the piece of art he finished with. Aerial shots of the cities were recreated with computers, frames were meticulously darkened or lightened when needed, (the auteur is so specific and detail-oriented that when the film ended he came up and said he'd never seen it so dark, the projector must be different than his, but what could he do?), and the giant phallus that is mentioned everywhere when speaking of the movie is an interesting moment because there is no way you could put a camera where it would be needed to capture that shot. There are religious underpinnings laid throughout between a Buddhist book given to our lead Oscar to peruse or the issue of reincarnation and whether the soul traveling after his death was finding itself a new vessel to be reborn in or just a journey back, recalling his own conception. Noé mentioned that he wanted it to feel like the time he watched the Lady in the Lake on mushrooms; I can't say I've ever done hallucinogens, but I can imagine the feeling would be similar to watching this work.There is so much to absolutely love as a cinephile here. The flashbacks to a time where Oscar and his sister Linda were in each others' lives, orphans after the horrific death of their parents, are shot with a filter to make them magically fairytale-like; the amount of crap crammed into each frame of the present, whether in Oscar's apartment, a nightclub bathroom of filth during a supposed drug dropoff, or the dressing room of Linda's strip club, or even the fictional ""Hotel Love"" made real in our dying spirit's vision from an elaborate model city shown to him some time before is immense; and the enhanced close-ups, again, are phenomenal—swooping up from an ashtray with a lit cigarette lying inside, burning and sizzling away  just gorgeous in a messed up way, much like a lot of things here. Speaking of the parents' death, what a sequence showing the car crash that took their lives. The sound is deafening, the truck's headlights coming straight for us as we watch it from the backseat, and the visceral, physical feeling of being rocked back yourself from the impact you cannot feel, it is seriously that effective. You become Oscar, transported into the movie to live through the chaos and turmoil. I'm liking the movie more and more as I write this essay, reliving the scenes and remembering how they grabbed me and threw me around  and yet I still don't know if I'll ever want to—or have the chance to—see it again. Do not expect this thing hitting a local multiplex any time in the near future; it's subject matter going way beyond your regular NC-17 flick.I do not want to nitpick the acting, since it is such a small part of the ride, but you can't help notice the amateurish quality. Nathaniel Brown plays Oscar—who admittedly isn't in the film as a person you see very much, more so utilized as voice-over at the start—in a debut role. Listening to him speak, while looking out through his eyes, can be somewhat painful as his line delivery is awkward and not quite realistic. The second lead, Linda, is played by Paz de la Huerta, a friend of Noé who one must wonder whether she earned the spot due to her being okay with nude and sex scenes rather than her acting skill. Again, though, the performances come secondary to any other visual flourish shown as the people really just become pawns to be played with and shot within the atmospheric environments. But there is one riveting turn, by Emily Alyn Lind as young Linda in flashbacks, needing to be mentioned. Wow, is this little girl phenomenal. Her screaming, inside the car at the moment of the crash looking at her bloodied parents, or being taken away by a family from her brother for adoption, sent chills down my spine. So emotionally draining, I worry for the parents who let her act in a film like this, in a role so demanding, but can't deny the power she adds, literally being the best actor by far.",Enter the Void
28,aciessi,Null and Void,4,11 April 2017,"An interesting, ambitious and provocative project for an experimental filmmaker, but by the midpoint, I was exhausted by it. In sections, it's very fascinating, including the opening scene (first person POV), the montage of the past flashing before his eyes and the final scene depicting a POV of the conception of a baby (graphic sexuality). But in long sections, it's absolutely grating on your patience with horrible dialogue and even worse acting. I mean, really bad.. just monotone dreck. If this kind of slow, abstract filmmaking is for you, I guarantee you that this is your kind of movie. If not, stay very clear.",Enter the Void
29,Horror_Flick_Fanatic,Psychedelic Tripping,8,1 September 2021,"This is without a doubt the most visually psychedelic film I have ever seen. From the very beginning the film assaults you with the starting credits flashing on screen in what seems like hundreds of separate colored fonts. Floating cameras that hover above and then fly through Tokyo like a bird's eye. Impressive visuals with gratuitous sex scenes from Tokyo's notorious love hotels that mostly look totally real. Some scenes with actual penetration on screen.Story wise, it isn't very deep. But it does touch lots of taboo subjects which will, and not may, but I am confident it will ruffle feathers. So for the easily offended by taboo depictions of sexual acts you may want to stay clear of this one. But if you are more of the adventurist type with your films, this film is a real trip. I will probably be a whole lot better if you are already high and with a partner lol.I am writing this in 2021 about a film made in 2009 and I am seriously impressed by the filmmaker's work.

30,oOgiandujaOo_and_Eddy_Merckx,"Ambitious, deeply mystic and provocative movie with earth-shattering FX",9,17 October 2009,"Gaspar Noé's big beast of a Cannes entrant showed for the first time in the UK this week in October. Gaspar Noé was there to introduce the film, which was a great kick for me, even though he didn't do a Q&A. His intro was quite funny, because he's not a grand intellectual, he's more of a sensualist. It's clear that he had a pretty dissipated youth and he talked about his experimentation with hallucinogenics and he always wondered as a kid why nobody was making movies with the images like he was seeing whilst high in them. So this is a movie I think he's wanted to make for a very long time, perhaps a couple of decades, but only now has he been able to get the freedom and funding to do it.He said he had seen the film Lady in the Lake after taking a magic mushroom; this is a 1947 Raymond Chandler adaptation which is shot in POV (that is, the camera is like the eyes of the lead). Gaspar had also been reading about life after death experiences, or near death experiences. So he wanted to combine the hallucinations, POV shooting, and out-of-body experience material. The result is 2 hour and 43 minutes of masterpiece. It will leave the ciné-gourmand gorged and bewildered. For me it's a clear step-up, even an evolution, from his last feature film in 2002, Irréversible. The idea of having out-of-body experiences really frees up the concept of POV, Noé's not limited by the body (which can't just glide forty feet into the air, or halfway across the city). He's really freed up to shoot the fluorescent sexual labyrinth of Tokyo, which is shot only at night-time and in POV.The story in the movie concerns a brother and sister (Oscar and Linda) who have a childhood trauma and end up moving to Tokyo in their late teens where they become involved in a heaving underworld. I think though that Tokyo is more of a metaphor in this film, I don't think he's trying to tell you anything about Tokyo the city per se, I think it's just the perfect pre-fabricated set for Noé. In the film it's a nerve centre, it's that place in life where we meet lovers, copulate, produce new life, and die. It's the mayfly (order Ephemeroptera, from the Greek for short-lived) part of the human lifecycle, which we experience in a heightened fashion through the eyes of Oscar.There's a lot of stuff in here for you to take offence to if you want, If you have ever taken offence to a film on content grounds as opposed to intellectual grounds, you're likely to take offence here. Pornographic linkages between adult sexuality and the Oedipus complex, for me are brilliant, but will upset many filmgoers.Those people who have decided that Noé is homophobic or misogynistic after seeing Irréversible are not going to have their minds changed by this movie at all. There seems to be a very strong link in his mind between sex and procreation. You don't have to consume the movie in a homophobic way in my opinion, but there may be a lot of upset gays after seeing this movie. Particularly as the gay character in this movie is portrayed as being on the same level as the rapist in Irréversible. There's no direct comment, but if you read between the lines, you may not like what you read.I think the androphiles are going to love Nathaniel Brown who plays the lead teen, Oscar, in this movie, which is his first credited role on IMDb, straight as I am, even I can tell he's a heartthrob. Paz de la Huerta as Linda, his sister, is very eye candyish too. If you like to see beautiful things writhing (we're talking eye popping next level FX hallucinations here, as well as copious sex), then this is the movie for you.I walked out of the cinema still tripping, the POV is so spectacularly well delivered that you feel almost like you're still in the movie when you come out, because the mode of perception hasn't changed. The lasting images I am left with are from the Love hotel, a very strange pastel and fluorescent building that has holo-reflectors design on the outside and which Noé dedicates a lot of the later part of the movie to, the FX emanations are spectacular.",Enter the Void
31,DonFishies,"A unique, experimental trip that is clearly not for everyone",5,23 January 2011,"There really is no way to properly review Enter the Void, the film by Gaspar Noé (of Irreversible notoriety). It premiered at film festivals around the world almost two years ago, and is only now available on DVD this week. I saw the trailer for the film last fall and was immediately intrigued, even without knowing much about the film. And now after having seen the film in all of its uncut 161 minute glory, I still am unsure if I know all that much about it.For those in search of some semblance of plot, the film has only the faintest – young adult Oscar (Nathanial Brown) is killed by police after a drug deal gone sour, and then reflects over his life as his soul wavers overhead as his friends and sister Linda (Paz de la Huerta) go on with their lives.I only mentioned the word semblance because Enter the Void really does not follow much of a plot, or even a cohesive structure. After Oscar's death, the film seems to just jump around from scene to scene, almost absentmindedly, telling little pieces of his life story and what happens after his death. And interspliced between those scenes, almost to the point of being set on a queue, are short sequences filled with lights and patterns akin to Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. I frequently felt blinded by these scenes, and had to look away more than once by just how powerful they are on-screen. I can only imagine how different they would look in a theatre.But the avant-garde style narrative seems to be the driving force of the film. Noé seems very content at experimenting with the filmmaking medium, and uses the film as a means of discussing the ideas and concepts surrounding birth and death, life and the afterlife, the soul and reincarnation. Through his subtle, and not very subtle means of visual communication, he dictates what may be the most creative and unique style of ideas and thoughts surrounding the subjects. And then he wraps all of those elements in multiple meanings and readings. I easily could write an essay on the multiple meanings of the title Enter the Void alone. But I digress, for it is clear from the opening credits (which also act as the closing credits), that the film was going to be one hell of a unique trip unlike any other. And I watched it with a clear mind. I can only imagine how someone under the influence of drugs would feel.Noé also seems very keen on using the camera to help express his visual motifs. It never stops moving in any instance. When it is not soaring over the real or electrified visual effect-created Tokyo cityscape, or jumping through the trippy light/pattern scenes, the camera is following Oscar at an almost lunatic speed. When he is actually seen on-screen, it is almost exclusively from the view of the back of his head (we rarely get to see his face). Frequently, it jumps into a POV shot showing us what Oscar is seeing and experiencing, or experiencing through the mind of another. It allows the viewer to become a voyeur, watching or experiencing life and death through this one young adult – almost as if we were a spirit watching his every move.But as interesting as this may all sound, I need to level with you – I hated almost every agonizing minute of Enter the Void. It may be trippy and thought-provoking stuff to discuss or overanalyze afterwards, but during it is a nightmare. I was confused, disgusted or bored for almost the entire film. I am told I fell asleep for a few moments, and I would not deny it – once you really get into the film and it piques your interest, it almost instantly loses it. For how unique and creative a film it is, it seems like Noé had absolutely no idea how much needed to be contributed to it. Shots are shown, and then shown again minutes or hours later, yet the context is always the same. Events seem to occur as if they were totally normal, but they are anything but. The film doubles as soft porn, but it seems like the graphic nudity was thrown in simply for shock value. Even the controversial ""missing reel"" cut from the initial theatrical run in the United States seems more abstract and silly than it does controversial (although one particular scene involved within it manages to be fairly disturbing). There easily could have been 30-40 minutes cut right out of the film, and there would be no meanings, no ideas and no real plot elements lost.The acting suffers as a result of this editing and narrative style. Brown mumbles his words in almost every instance, making it incredible difficult to hear what he is saying in most cases. And as we see the film mostly from his eyes, he never really gets a chance to perform or emote. Huerta, Cyril Roy and Masato Tanno all give it their all, and manage to pull off some form of a performance, but the story never lends them the credence to make something of their roles.But then, it is unfair to really discuss and critique the performances as they are never the focus of what is occurring on-screen. This is an experimental project for Noé first and a film second. What he has created is purely artistic, but it is flawed. I feel confident discussing it now, but was left totally speechless after watching it. Of course, this could have been the exact response Noé wanted to elicit from his audience. Or perhaps he wanted them to just stop, think and experience his idea of life after death. Either way, Enter the Void is bound to make you feel something.

The rest of the film is a largely psychedelic take on the journey of the soul per the Tibetan Book of the Dead, at least as briefly summarized by his friend, Alex. (I've read the Book of the Dead and this isn't an accurate representation.) BTW, there's a LOT of sex scenes in this as his soul searches for a couple to reincarnate into. Lots of pulsating lights, colors, blurry focus. It's an interesting film approach to the matter even if you don't subscribe to it. If you watch this while high, it's probably a real visual trip and you might rate it near 10, but I watched sober so much of its effect is lost on me, hence a lower score. Not that you may care, but at death I doubt your soul flies around the local area looking for a reincarnation target. I personally think the soul survives death but it's far more complex to explain where you end up in this or another part of the universe or some other dimension or plane of existence.",Enter the Void
33,asda-man,The greatest visual experience ever!,9,24 March 2014,"I saw this last night and I'm pretty sure that I'm still tripping! Enter the Void confirms Gaspar Noe as a true talent and artist. He does things here which I didn't know were even possible in film. The camera-work is mesmerising, entrancing and unlike anything I've ever seen. It has to be the greatest film I've ever seen on a visual level.The title sequence was absolutely amazing and completely sets the tone for the film. We're then plunged into the POV of an American man in Tokyo. It becomes dizzying (in a good way) and when he starts smoking those drugs I was completely under Noes spell. It's intoxicating filmmaking at its most hypnotic.The visuals only become more intense as the film goes on with Noe's now signature stroboscopic effects which is enough to put anyone in a trance! The way the camera seamlessly floats is just extraordinary. Most of the scenes are done in one shot, like Irreversible, which adds an extra level of intensity. Towards the end, the camera casually soars through the clouds and we go inside an aeroplane, only to plummet back down to the grimy inner-city of Tokyo. It's beautiful, fluid and doesn't feel forced. It's a film you just have to immerse yourself in (preferably on a big screen) and go with.Gaspar's film isn't just about the visuals though. There is a compelling story there too which dominates the first half. The film tells the Oscar's life story leading up to his death. It's a fascinating watch and very absorbing. Unfortunately after we've covered all of this, we're only halfway through the film which is an exhausting 2 hours and 40 minutes (I saw the directors cut) and so the story began to falter for me. It just wasn't engaging enough to carry on for another 90 minutes, although the visuals were still spectacular.Enter the Void reminded me very much of a David Lynch film. You have to immerse yourself in the world of the film and allow yourself to become suffocated by the truly extraordinary camera-work. If there was any justice then Gaspar Noe really should've won a best director academy award for this film, but alas this is far too edgy for the academy. Gaspar really pushes the boundaries of what can be done on screen. He knocks it way out of the ball park and hits the stratosphere! I found the pornographic scenes a little unnecessary, although the camera-work in the 'Love' hotel was so hypnotic it doesn't really matter. I didn't like it as much as Irreversible though, and I think it would've been better if the film had been edited down a considerable amount to create more impact. However, Enter the Void is an extraordinary experience and is unlike anything I've ever seen. The only film I can compare it to is David Lynch's masterpiece, Inland Empire, as it matches the dreamlike quality.Enter the Void is a full on assault on the senses which has to be seen to be believed. I have no idea why no one talked about it when it was released because it feels so ahead of its time. The neon-soaked cinematography is as stunning as Only God Forgives. The film just needed a stronger story in order for it to justify its long running time. The acting was a little wooden too unfortunately. Still, this is a brilliant and seriously unique experience which confirms Noe as a true artist. We need more people as bold as him in the business!",Enter the Void
34,PIST-OFF,drugs,9,5 February 2012,"Gaspar Noe has made an excellent movie, nearly flawless. If you're the type of person not scared off by the prospect of a two and a half hour psychedelic meditative treatise exploring death and the afterlife then you will probably think this movie is perfect. My only qualm is the actress who did an excellent job but i believe could have been cast better. This may also qualify as the best LSD movie to watch ever. Half the movie seems to be like some buddhist black light poster come to life. The movie's vision of the afterlife makes it seem heart wrenching. What really could possibly be lonelier than wandering among the living but unable to interact with them? Such a shame that such a great film is so unknown. On the other hand if you're a fan of Vin Diesel movie you should probably stay away.",Enter the Void

I am not a fan of the adolescent shaky camera style, and the cinematography made me dizzy. It was an art film, that was out of control. First of all, it is nearly impossible to convey being high on film. The film the Doors proved that. If an accomplished director such as Oliver Stone failed at it, how is this guy going to convey it? And the afterlife scenes? Come on. Get a grip. If you are willing to devote two hours of your life to an experiment go ahead and watch this thing. I could not make it through the whole movie.

36,loganx-2,Out Of Your Body And Into The Fire,8,6 October 2010,"Enter The Void is the story of Oscar a late teens early twenty something drug dealer living in Tokyo. Oscar lives with his estranged sister Linda, after the two were orphaned by a car crash as children.The film opens with some brief introductions, including introducing Oscar to his drug of choice DMT (which is described as being similar to the experience of death), of which Oscar has become obsessed since reading the Tibetan Book Of The Dead.The interest in near death experience as ""the ultimate trip"" grows like so many of Oscars desires, fears, and fantasies from his parents death, an event which plays out again and again the film; as a traumatic scar that never closes, even in death.After a six minute trip full of spiraling layers of shapes, patterns, and what look like deep sea fish in a fluorescent microscope, Oscar is abruptly shot to death in the bathroom of a bar called ""The Void"", whereupon his soul leaves his body floating sideways into the night sky, through walls, and even into other people's bodies.The film is divided into four parts, the first Oscar's death told in 1st person pov, the second Oscar's life leading up to his death where we observe the back of Oscar's head within the frame, the third the lives of those affected by Oscar's death shown through over the shoulder ariel shots of Oscar's soul as it flys over the city, and the final a trip through the ""Hotel Love"" a partially imaginary place where all the film's characters have sex with each other in the various red tinted rooms while their genitals are surrounded by phosphorescent hallows of undulating color.""Enter The Void"" is a character study but one of a character who is at a point in his existence when ""personality"" simply is no longer an issue.The second portion of the film showcases some of Gaspar Noe's talent as editor as it's essentially a sustained stream of conscious montage (like something you would find a New Wave film from Alain Resnais) creating a network of desires from Oscar's mother's death to his guilt over abandoning his sister, to an affair with an older women (which directly causes his eventual death), from the earliest notions of Freudian pleasure suckling at his mother's breast to his later day oral obsessive drug habit (smoking, pills, etc), his destruction is built into his desires and back again, many times over.Noe goes through pains, some would say to the point of destroying the film with repetition to stress these points, as George Bataille transformed eggs and urine from emblems of his own traumatic childhood into obsessive erotic rituals for his character's to live out in his own French transgressive classic ""Story Of The Eye"", so does Noe reveal his wounded characters with reoccurring images of a car crashed and lips reaching for an exposed breast (If your recalling Cronenberg's ""Crash"" your not mistaken).Some have accused the film and Noe of being obsessed with the ugly side of life; abortion, murder, drug use etc. And this would almost pass did the film not end in literal rebirth (certainly the most optimistic end of any Noe film so far). Likewise the film has been called ""nihilistic"", ignoring that the existence of the soul and reincarnation are tangible aspects of the plot, or that said ""rebirth"" taking place in the ""love"" hotel, where sex makes everyone glow like angels.I suspect the mistaken attribution of nihilism to the film stems from this lack of any non-Earthbound transcendence. The same lust that lead Oscar to his death, lead his soul into a new body, and the Karmic keeps on-a-spinning with no end in sight.Oscar spends most of the third acts trying to avoid floating into sources of light, which the camera is pulled into the way light is sucked into a black hole, the image warping and bulging at the seams as it descends.There was a time when leading critics like Andrew Sarris considered Kubrick's ""2001"" little more than trumped up hippie freak out cinema.Ask yourself if it's vague ideas about human transformation and evolution wrapped in the Star-child; a fetus in the empty womb of space or it's ten minute psychedelic worm hole, are any more ridiculous than glowing sex angels and a water wall of ejaculate.ETV is the kind of film you cannot be impartial to, it makes demands and challenges on the viewer. For anyone to not be impressed with its cinematography, editing, sound, and special effects they would either have to be disingenuous or incredibly narrow in their tastes. The psychological underpinnings of Oscar's motivations are repeated so many times, I'm almost lost for words when I read critics describe the film as incomprehensible.By comparison to his previous films which featured 10 minute anal rape scenes, some unmanifested Oedipal desires in EVT are like a breath of fresh air in the sweatiest dankest leather gimp outfit.EVT is less a surrealist film as it is neo-realism taken to its logical extreme where the interior geography of the subject is as meticulously recorded as his external environment.""Enter The Void"" may wear the temporal skin of a drug film, but beneath the veneer of fear and loathing, is a soul searing with inventive cinematic flair and a desire to push towards the limits of an art form, eroding boundaries between mental states as it straddles genre lines between psychedelic ghost story and perverse love story like ""Wings Of Desire"" hovering on the painted clouds of Stan Brakhage.The void is full of wonders.",Enter the Void
37,rooee,Enter >Here<,7,9 October 2010,"A week after the initial rush of watching Gaspar Noe's follow-up to 2002's infamous Irreversible, and I'm happy to report no symptoms of a comedown.Enter the Void is a far better vehicle for Noe's brand of twirling visuals and echochamber audio. In Irreversible these flamboyances felt distracting; technical digressions that stole us away from the horror of the subject matter – it's notable that in that film's most frighteningly effective scene the camera fell still. In Enter the Void, we ARE the disembodied narrator: we live his fears, curiosities and oedipal desires.The abridged story: Boy becomes drug dealer to pay for sister's plane ticket to perma-night Japan. Boy is shot dead in botched drugs raid. Boy becomes angel, observing sister's self-destructive grief. With all its first-person death and despair and titillation, this is exploitation movie-making of the virtuoso kind. But it is also, at times, heart-rending, particularly in its depiction of the single event that drew Oscar (Nathaniel Brown) and Linda (Paz de la Huerta) into an unbreakable childhood embrace. There's a womb-like tranquillity to Oscar's Angel-Vision: a kind of serene detachment, which makes his inability to intervene all the more poignant. Even when brother and sister were separated by 5000 miles, they knew they would see each other – one day, one day. But in death, Linda is tragically cut free of that shared umbilical. Death may have no dominion – but left behind on the mortal coil, how's she to know that?Did we really need the Tibetan Book of the Dead subplot? It seems rather hokey. That Oscar's journey follows the chapters of the Book is a lot more interesting than mumbled, drug-fuelled dialogue detailing its content and meaning. It's a pity that Noe didn't let us make the connection by ourselves.Some scenes fall disappointingly flat. Those involving Victor's (Olly Alexander from Bright Star) family, particularly, are jarringly unconvincing. It's as if Noe isn't comfortable directing petty domestic disputes because he has bigger fish perceptions to fry... Or more likely, it's because English is not his first language.The film's ""Love Hotel"" climax may appear to labour its point through repetition; but then Enter the Void is a fresh look at the circles of life – the rhythms of corporeal existence; kill, cure, love, create – so perhaps we should just lie back and surrender and feel safe in the knowledge that we're witnessing the progress of a film-maker who will one day give the world a vital work of art. Just not quite yet.",Enter the Void
38,GeorgeRoots,"Visually Unique, But Everything Else Needs Polish.",8,15 September 2014,"Director Gasper Noe's efforts are admirable and ambitious, and to any film-maker I would say have the greatest ambition possible. ""Enter The Void"" has a fantastic soundtrack, and its method of cinematography and visual aesthetics are jaw dropping. Unfortunately everything else is largely hit and miss, which is what I hope to discuss here now.The film follows the final moments of Oscar, a young American drug dealer who gets shot by the police, but continues to watch following events during an out-of-body experience. Shot in a first-person view that floats across the ceiling, above the city streets and occasionally features Oscar staring over his own shoulder as he recalls moments from his past.Every character is incredibly dull, and whether or not the focus of the picture were these people is arguable. Oscar doesn't say much and his past begins to paint a really unlikable character, surrounded by very sketchy people and some horrific trauma's that the film keeps repeating (Maybe a perception of time).Many critics have been divided, and here are the multiple interpretations that made the movie so enjoyable for me to watch. Noe describes the film's subject as ""The sentimentality of mammals, and the shimmering vacuity of the human experience"". The director (Who opposes all religion) says that ""The whole movie is a dream of someone who read The Tibetan Book of the Dead, and heard about it before being shot by a gun. It's not the story of someone who dies, flies and is reincarnated, it's the story of someone who is stoned when he gets shot and who has an intonation of his own dream"". The director also leaves open the possibility that Oscar's life starts over again in an endless loop, again due to the human brain's perception of time.So after sitting through the lengthy production and then reading the directors notes, I suddenly began to appreciate his efforts and viewed the film in that frame of mind. The ""trip"" is the heart of the movie, and everything else is underwhelming. As far as recreating and representing drug effects, ""Enter The Void"" may be the best interpretation ever created, and I like to think the following events are the brain's (Oscar's) final synapses than actual reality. By the end I was never looking for a definitive answer, as I also feel it would've denounced a lot of the mystique around the picture. Final Verdict: It's gorgeously shot, and had everything been fine tuned just a little bit more I'd rate it higher. This is still one of those films you have to see, and definitely an exhausting experience you should discuss and share with your friends. 8/10.",Enter the Void
39,Meven_Stoffat,"""Void"" is right",2,1 April 2011,"If this truly is art, we're f#@ked.That's right. We're truly f#@ked. It shows that we live in a predictable society. A society where something ""different"" is by defaults great, or ""art"". I really do beg to differ.First off this film is 160 minutes. That's right. 160 FRACKING MINUTES. And part of the film is the same scene repeated at least 5 times. Trust me, you could cut this down to 100 minutes and nothing would be lost (as if there was anything to begin with), and that's a sign that it's a VERY bad film.What very little plot there is relies on the film's annoying style. Actually there is no plot. The idea of a first person film may sound good on paper- and I'll admit in the first 30 minutes it works well.30 minutes it works well? Well maybe if the whole movie was like that, it'd be great! But then we have 90 minutes where Nathaniel Brown's fat head takes up the frame. The rest is just crane shots that have little to no relevance. I swear I could draw a map of Japan, there's so many overhead shots.Don't even think of getting me started on the lights coming out of people's genitals, or the CGI ""Vagina cam"" shot and weird sex. And the sex scene at the end and birthing scene? Trust me, this film only exist to attract smug elitist scum.

40,dallasryan,Enter the Place you Won't Soon Forget!,10,1 March 2012,"This is a great movie and it's very difficult to understand how great it is with only one viewing. I've seen it 3 times and I still learn stuff from it. The dialogue is muddled, therefore you will probably miss a lot of what is going on during the first viewing, but Gaspar wants to kind of show a more realistic quality to the movie and the afterlife, and that's pretty much why he has the dialogue so wishy-washy. Enter the Void is a great movie on so many levels, just a few examples are 'do we really keep promises after we die or do we choose to go where we want to go after we die regardless if we promised it or not?' So many different concepts in this movie. The acting is very good, and probably not even necessarily intentionally good, it just is naturally and organically good for this type of movie. You look at this story on paper, and it's a very sad one, a brother and sister who were always very close, they were in the car with their parents through a horrific car accident, and after their parents died in the accident and they survived, their brother and sister bond grew even stronger(some things are so deep within your soul you can't forget them and/or let them go), almost even a borderline 'in love' type relationship. Their souls are very connected is the point that Gaspar is making. The brother at one point in the movie, in a flashback says, 'I'll be with your forever and ever.' How very true this statement ends up being. Enter the Void is one of the best movies shown on the Reincarnation Concept, the visuals are utilized to their fullest to bring this movie to such a deep reality within anyone who views this film. The film shots are crazy, bizarre, amazing, and only a director like Gaspar could pull such a movie off. This movie is thrilling, boring, chilling, scary, it's pretty much everything you can think of once you get a full grasp of it. Of course this movie is not going to be for everyone, it's probably not going to be for most people actually. Enter the Void is almost 2 and a half hours long and about an hour and 20 minutes shows the back of the main characters head only, the camera is following the back of his head around, so that kind of thing is not going to be for most people, which I don't blame them, but if it doesn't bother you, you're in for a real mind treat here!(I almost think the back of people's heads were the only thing that was auditioned for-for the lead role in this movie, and I must admit, the back of the lead character's head gives a very eerie feeling to the movie, so I never thought I'd say this, but perhaps they were looking for the perfect-creepy back of someone's head, and in all seriousness, I think that's what Gaspar was going for. Plus the lead looks like a drug dealing meth head too, so that doesn't hurt either ;)). The title has many different meanings. To Enter the Void is to Enter the Death, to follow the death of a person as we do on this spiritual journey of the afterlife. Terms that are used when someone dies is Blank Void or Black Void, so they are dead, they have this blank emptiness in their eyes now, their soul is gone from their body, which is what this crazy-brilliant movie is all about. You follow where the soul goes, literally, in more ways than one. Enter the Void also means Enter the Emptiness which is a clear metaphor to enter our empty lives and even more so referring to enter the emptiness in the brother and sister in this movie, the emptiness in their lives and all of their friends' lives too(again also a metaphor for everyone's life in general, depending on how you look at things, but that's very subjective as most of this is). There is a lot of emptiness through the brother and sister, especially after their parent's death, and the only thing that keeps their emptiness filled, is their love for each other. In my opinion, a brilliant movie, I think over time this movie will be regarded as the modern day '2001: A Space Odyssey'. I say that, not saying they are similar stories, they're not at all, but they both have an enigma quality that's never quite truly revealed about them, plus there is a lot of pauses and space within both of these movies, plus there are many crazy scenes in Enter the Void for any drug induced persons out there to enjoy, just like there is in that one infamous sequence in '2001: A Space Odyssey.' Both movies have lot's of similarities, both have lot's of differences, but all in all, Enter the Void is an amazing movie that both evokes lots of different emotions out of you and, also, to where it is thought provoking to the highest power. I can't forget to mention it is a very long film, but it needs to be to very long in order to be as powerful as it is. Giant would not have been the great movie it was without its extremely long running time, and the same goes for Enter the Void. (Almost in the same concept, but yet much different, as how Sofia Coppola's movies catch you with her ending's, she has a formula and she hooks you in right at the end. The two I'm thinking of are Lost in Translation and Somewhere). Also, I can't forget to mention the very powerful musical sound editing and a very powerful music score in Enter the Void, and again, the visuals in this movie will blow you away.",Enter the Void
41,asifahsankhan,Noé is a virtuoso of camera movement!,8,27 June 2017,"Directed by Gaspar Noé, Enter the Void (2009 movie) is ""the psychological story of a soul, observing the repercussions of his death, seeks resurrection.""—Which is one of the weirdest reasons why this film is always at the top of my weird movie lists. It's one of a kind—a strange and tragic story! Nevertheless, it's one hell of a picture in motion. It is loud, garish, ugly and staggeringly empty. If your idea of visionary filmmaking is someone flashing brightly coloured lights at you, then count yourself in for a treat; you are about to experience some visionary filmmaking. The rest of us will get a repetitive shuffling of unpleasant individuals doing unpleasant things, inter-cut with lots of neon and occasionally a towering penis shoved in our faces (Thank God it wasn't shot in 3D). I don't care how amazing of a technical experience this is. Not only does the emperor have no clothes. He's tea-bagging your wife.Worth watching? Just that one time for a lot of you, probably (if not surely). It's not the greatest film ever made, possibly one of the most memorable cinema experiences in terms of effects, it's overlong, uncomfortable, and excessive, but of course, it's worth viewing as there aren't many movies like it. I'm not epileptic, but I do suffer (even though I hate using that word in this context) from hypnotic (sleep paralysis.) If my understanding is correct, this movie is centred (loosely) around DXM, which triggers lucid dreams. I feel like, because of that, it can get really relocatable for some us. It's not a horror movie, and can't possibly worry about being ""scared,"" per say, I just know it's incredibly real and explicit, and don't want it to keep me awake at night because I can't get the images out of my head.This psychedelic tour of life after death is seen entirely from the point of view of Oscar (Nathaniel Brown), a young American drug dealer and addict living in Tokyo with his prostitute sister, Linda (Paz De La Huerta). When Oscar is killed by police during a bust gone bad, his spirit journeys from the past—where he sees his parents before their deaths—to the present—where he witnesses his own autopsy—and then to the future, where he looks out for his sister from beyond the grave.Overall, it is, in its way, just as provocative, just as extreme, just as mad, just as much of an outrageous ordeal: it arrives here slightly re-edited from the version first shown at Cannes. But despite its querulous melodrama and crazed Freudian pedantry's, it has a human purpose and its sheer deranged brilliance is magnificent. This is a grandiose hallucinatory journey into, and out of, hell: drugged, neon-lit and with a fully realised nightmare-porn aesthetic that has to be seen to be believed. Love him or loathe him – and I've done both in my time – Gaspar Noé (director) is one of the very few directors who is actually trying to do something new with the medium, battling at the boundaries of the possible. It has obvious debts, but ""Enter the Void"" is utterly original film-making, and Noé is a virtuoso of camera movement.",Enter the Void

Enter the void is a bit like Lost in translation, but goes so much deeper and bizarrely more realistic even, if you consider it not to be about Tokyo itself, but rather a set of values (or lack thereof) you can find there.The pumping techno soundtrack, the acid visuals, the camera-work hand-held or steadycaming in inhumane ways, the shock and spectacle, only Gaspars previous movie Irreversible can prepare you for this, but then again not quite.This is probably the best movie I will see this year and I will never forget it.

I enjoyed the brilliant artwork and the vivid colour scheme so much.

In particular, I like avant-garde design in the love hotel. And the description was so unique ane crazy in love scenes. In spite of no pixceled, couples emitted lights.At first, the images were shot in the first person view. At next, it changed to in the camera which followed the back of characters like 'Son of Saul.' Finally, it changed again to the god ones as it bustled around a lot of places in Tokyo freely. I wanted to listen to the music of the main theme in that sequence!Honestly, the content left me with a bitter taste in my mouse. If it didn't have crazy images, I dislike it definitely.

44,Indyrod,Amazing psychedelic neon trip through the mind...,9,18 October 2010,"France's Gaspar Noe (Irreversible, I Stand Alone), has delivered an incredible explosion of mind trips, neon, psychedelic strobing lights, amazing visual effects and photography that gives the viewer a voyeuristic trip through the channels of the brain. The story is basically a Brother and Sister that lost their parents in a tragic car wreck when they were children, and divided into different homes, but have rekindled their love for each other after many years. The Sister (Linda) is a stripper, and the Brother (Oscar) is a druggie and occasional drug dealer. After Linda leaves for work, Oscar decides to get stoned, but a friend calls him wanting him to bring him a stash. The nightlife of Tokyo is on display, with glittering everything and very bright flashing colors as we enter Oscar's mind for a trip after he gets shot. For most of the movie, Oscar appears to be watching over his Sister, or is this just what his fading brain cells are producing, kind of in a ""Jacob's Ladder"" way. Either way, the visuals produce a very trippy effect and make this a supreme stoner film. It's a movie of drugs, graphic sex, and a journey towards the creation of the very start of a life, following from inside the woman, receiving the sperm swimming towards the female egg, fertilizing it and, then the baby. Even though the story itself is kind of second to all the mind blowing visuals, it still anchors the movie to a point, that this is not just one big light show with dazzling visual effects. I believe the movie is concentrating on the circle of life, from beginning to end, and also showing the damaging effects of drugs as a hole. But more than that, the viewer is challenged at all times to follow the story, whose mind are we in as we take in the images. Since they are images of the mind, time shifts are constant as memories become realities as everything moves along. But being merely a voyeur in all of this, we watch other people's lives, watch their passion, love making, and daily dealings. The visuals might be too much for some people, because they are somewhat hard to watch at times, especially when the images are slightly blurred. But all in all, I loved this movie, because I became so engrossed in everything going on, and the frenetic visuals taxed my own brain to capture whatever Gaspar Noe was throwing at me. The movie is hypnotizing in many places in a good way, at least I thought so, but different people with different life experiences will come to their own conclusions about this fascinating movie. It's hard to imagine where Noe will take us next.",Enter the Void
45,colinrgeorge,Enter at Your Own Risk,7,10 October 2010,"One thing's for sure, you won't leave Gaspar Noé's ""Enter the Void"" with comparisons ready. More than likely, you won't want to think about it at all. Over two and a quarter hours, the film hijacks your consciousness like a potent hallucinogen, and leaves you feeling burnt out and brain-fried on the other end.Is it worth the trip? Yes, with an asterisk. After all, the opportunity to see something this flagrantly original comes but once in a blue moon, yet it isn't the sort of experience many will enjoy having. ""Enter the Void"" begins with a strobing title sequence that explodes into a first person account of drugs and death in Tokyo; it ought to come with a seizure warning. Compounding matters, almost every scene is designed to look like one continuous shot, with the camera being placed either behind our protagonist Oscar's head, or behind his eyelids. As if the pulsating neon lights weren't enough, we're also subjected to the split-second blackouts of Oscar blinking.Visually, ""Enter the Void"" is unlike anything I've ever seen, but it sure ain't perfect. The problem, bluntly, is its amorphous, front-heavy structure. The first half plays out conventionally enough, beginning with what we assume is the end, and playing flashback catch up to contextualize the subsequent events. We arrive back in the present to neatly tie the knot, only to discover that Noé isn't remotely close to finished telling his story.Where he takes ""Enter the Void"" in its ethereal second half is actually pretty fascinating, conceptually. However, it feels like an entirely different film. Noé floats aimlessly back and forth across Neo-Tokyo (to support the 'one shot' aesthetic, he rarely cuts directly from one location to another, often necessitating that the camera move through walls and entire buildings). The film really wears its premise thin during this overlong stint, though the last twenty minutes mostly redeem it.The conclusion is a little predictable given that the characters seem to be arbitrarily engrossed by the Tibetan Book of the Dead, but it works because it boils ""Enter the Void"" down to its visual core. Somewhere along the way, the lines of the narrative are obliterated and Noé takes a hypnotically beautiful and bizarre psychosexual detour that bridges the gap to his ending nicely.In retrospect, it's easy to remember the curious power of its final moments and marginalize the boredom that divides it from the first, much stronger hour. The film would almost certainly benefit from a second viewing, but I'm still not entirely sure that I would ever grant it one. I seriously question how Noé and his editor could stand to watch and assemble this film all day every day, because even their 137-minute finished product is a workout for the eyes. God help us if it were released in 3D.But for better or worse, eyestrain is part of the experience, and ""Enter the Void"" is more an incomparable experience than a great film. It's a shame that the vast majority of its potential audience will never even have the opportunity to see it projected, as I can only imagine home video will diminish its psychedelic impact.The best recommendation I can make is that if, like me, you go out of your way to see distinctly different films, you'll get your money's worth with ""Enter the Void."" Objectively, it's hard to deny the incredible creative scope and visual audacity on display, but it's also hard not to wish the whole thing were just a wee bit more succinct.It ain't perfect, but ""Enter the Void"" is original, and there's no undervaluing that. Hell, I'll try anything once.",Enter the Void
46,larry-411,"Trippy & dreamy, but be sure you're prepared",7,24 September 2009,"I attended the International Premiere of ""Enter the Void"" at the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival. Fans of director Gaspar Noé, whose film ""Irreversible"" created a significant following, will not be disappointed. At two and a half hours long, this film is definitely not for everyone. But I knew that going in and got exactly what I'd hoped for and more. It's trippy, dreamy, and mesmerizing and left me shaking my head in wonder many times. Startling and risky performances punctuate the dazzling visuals. The biggest surprise for me: ""Enter the Void"" has much more of a narrative than I was expecting. I was prepared for a cinematic acid trip, which I got, but there is an actual storyline which threads through the experimental camera-work and effects which are at the heart of the film. I highly recommend this movie but with qualifications, though. There is a great deal of drug use and some explicit sex but the film is compelling.",Enter the Void
47,Someguysomwhere,"What to say? Love sometimes has no respect for boundaries, I guess. I dunno.",10,15 November 2010,"This movie is about the ambiguous love relationship between a brother and sister orphaned and separated at an early age. Somehow the brother, Oscar, winds up in Tokyo, Japan leaving his sister behind. How and when exactly he got there is not told. He's a young adult now hanging out on the fringes with questionable friends and seemingly drifting through life; no job and no goal.At some point he decides he would like his sister to join him in Tokyo. He has no money, however, to do this. Since working for a living is not an option (""everybody who has a job is just a slave"") he gets involved with drugs --doing it and selling it-- to make enough to pay his sister's way. The story is told in backwards fashion from the perspective of Oscar as a ghost active in the present while intermittently reviewing his past. His point of view is the back of the head of his living self, which is also the view we the audience have throughout the film.Although this movie is principally about the curious love relationship between Oscar and Linda, it is also about young people trying to make it on their own and find themselves after a rough start with the traumatic death of their parents at an early age. It is very innovative in the telling of it's story. I don't believe I've seen anything quite like it. Believe me, this not anything that Hollywood or the usual film makers would generate. It's strictly ""outside the box"" as the expression goes. It boldly and creatively goes into TABOO LAND --from the perspective of a ghost.There is a voyeuristic quality throughout this movie in the way the camera is used to film it's subjects via the eyes of Oscar, whose face --or front view in general-- is never directly shown. This effects a somewhat ""real-life"" or ""amateur"" flavor reminiscent of some of those ""real life"" shows where the camera follows people around as they go about their routine and we watch. Again, in this instance the camera is Oscar's eyes. As well, Oscar is a ghost hovering invisibly overhead hearing and seeing everything ---and sometimes participating.I don't remember if I've ever given a movie 10 stars, perhaps once, I'm not sure. What perfection is can be a tricky thing; a ""philisophical"" thing. And we can't all agree on it. For myself, I usually do not trust reviews that have 9 or 10 stars. I tend to be very skeptical when I see that many stars rolled out. So I don't blame you if you are skeptical yourself. Good for you. If I want to be as objective as possible, this movie, in my humble view, is AT THE VERY LEAST 7 STARS. But I suppose it will always boil down to ""personal taste"" based on one's personality and life experience. So I can't guarantee that you will like this movie as much as I. But I think that we will both agree that it is ""different"". Love, Boloxxxi.",Enter the Void
48,Radu_A,The intellectual's 'Inception' - a 'Now I've seen it all' death trip back to life,8,13 December 2010,"So what could I add to what has been stated in the other reviews? Yes, 'Enter the Void' is definitely a trippy mindbuster, and as such anyone who requires story or frames to enjoy a film should give it a miss. Yes, the visuals are eye-popping and the ubiquitous stroboscope effects may cause severe nausea - I watched it on BR and couldn't help but thinking what an advantage home entertainment can be over cinema exposure. This is a film which may be best enjoyed alone, somewhat stoned or drunk, and very late at night. And the pause button is definitely a life-saver.I can sympathize with those who felt tormented by the epic runtime and disparity between the first and second half of the film: the former is sort of a 'last film' of the protagonist Victor retelling his life, and therefore makes sense plot-wise, the latter is a meandering flow representing his attachment to his sister. It is a bit unfair to discard the film for this reason, though, because the dialogue between Victor and his best friend Alex in the beginning hints at what the nature and culmination of this attachment will be. The interspersed aerial shots of an increasingly CG-rendered Tokyo may actually put this transition into question - this could all very well be part of Victor's 'death trip'.What I really liked about 'Enter the Void' is the setting, for I have lived in Tokyo myself for three years. The area where the story takes place (judging from where the CG puts the Tokyo Tower) should be Roppongi, which is an expat and night club haven; while the CG makes the place appear a bit gaudy, it is indeed populated by a disproportionate number of drop-outs and sleazy bees, and I've always wondered why there's no film about Roppongi yet - contemporary Tokyo is mostly condensed to the Yakuza backdrop of Kabukichô or the juvenile epicenter of Shibuya. So on that note, I appreciate a film about the expat world, as weird and dysfunctional as it may be.'Enter the Void' pushes the gates of what film can visually do visually wide open, and therefore shouldn't be dismissed by any cinephile. But your viewing conditions will be crucial to whether you will love this film or hate it.",Enter the Void

She becomes a dancer and a slut/druggie/drunk whatever.One night the guy gets shot by the cops during a drug bust and then the rest of the film seems to want to aggravate and annoy you by over doing the afterlife thing with constant overhead camera work, trippy lights etc the film just went AWOL.Had Gasper limited this use of 'artistic' expression we would of had a much better film.

50,IndustriousAngel,A truly mesmerising experience,8,12 October 2018,"Enter the Void doesn't tell much of a story (the plot could have been squeezed in 10 minutes), but it offers an experience like few other films ... this is for people who find Aronofsky maybe a little bland and Cronenberg too silly; it's also a great date movie if your date happens to be a nihilistic buddhist junkie.
The whole ""plot"" gets foreshadowed in the first minutes where Oscar's friend Alex tells him about what happens to the soul after death, according to the Tibetan Book of the Dead. So, no big surprises that after Oscar's premature demise, we follow exactly those steps - but that doesn't take away any enjoyment; the scenes Oscar witnesses, the memories of his and his sister Linda's crual and/or tender past - it all makes for a truly mesmerizing piece of art. It's not only the images (quite revolutionary and visceral in themselves), it's the rhythm, the music (fantastic selection, with Bach's glassharped Air breaking the ice), the human brutality and the little spots of tenderness. And just when I was thinking the one thing the film couldn't offer me were any surprises, and Elton John would sing 'Circle of Life' (the scene with the pregnancy test), I looked at the watch and, what?! - there's an hour more?! I was hooked for good ...
This is not an actor's movie, very little in the way of dialogue or development, and most scenes are filmed from above anyway, but the cast do their job and I was positively surprised by Paz de la Huerta whose Linda radiates a heartrending vulnerabilty I wouldn't usually associate with this actress.There's not a single joke in this movie and very few sceens anyone would find funny ... so, as mentioned, as a date movie it really depends on your date - but if he/she likes 'Enter the Void', well - you're lucky, that's obviously a person worth knowing!",Enter the Void

52,Richard_Alex_Jenkins,This Trip Went On Too Long,6,16 January 2014,"Enter The Void is a sufficiently thought provoking film to write a review about, so it instantly gets a couple of stars for that, but is it an enjoyable enough film in its own right? Not for me.The first half hour was quite boring, followed by an hour of enjoyment, but by the end of the film I was really bored again. There's something wrong with a piece of entertainment that peaks in the middle instead of having an enticing start, establishing values in the middle followed by a gripping conclusion. But this is not a conventional film.The film is an hour too long due to the tripped out sequences from one scene to the next, especially the excruciatingly boring overhead street scenes. Imagine that you're watching events from a spiritual cortex, hovering slightly above street level somewhere within a building, perhaps as the spirit of a recently deceased person or while having an out-of-the-body experience and then travelling across each room, street, through each other building until you arrive at the destination of the next scene in the movie. We're at the strip club then something happens back at the apartment, so we're subjected to 20 or 30 seconds of spiritually winging our way from a hovering point of view perspective between locations. I shut my eyes at one point and counted to ten, waiting for the next scene - unfortunately, because I hadn't taken any acid or DMT before the film, it just sort of got old.I also had a problem with the shuddery, blurry and blinking cinematics, viewing life from a dead person's perspective or while tripping, and although I appreciate that life may not be fully discernible or attainable for long periods of time when having out of the body experiences, I didn't feel comfortable watching a film like this for such a long time. It felt like shoddy camera work for young people going through their psychotropic drug phase.To be fair, it is an unusual film with some genuinely shocking moments, but it's not entertaining enough viewing for two-and-a-half hours. I also think that if it had been directed by Lars Von Trier, for example, it could have been absolutely brilliant.",Enter the Void

54,ihrtfilms,Want to take a trip without the acid? This is for you!,4,2 December 2010,"If you would like to experience an hallucinatory trip, but don't wish to actually take acid, then Gaspar Noe's new film might be just what you need. This is a difficult film to review, mainly because for me it sits somewhere between art installation and film, but also because the story or narrative and the characters we meet are very difficult to like because they barely exist.Oscar is an American living with his sister in Tokyo. Shortly after she leaves to go to work, Oscar takes a hit of drugs and spends some time on a trip, that comprises of an array of dazzling and kaleidoscope like patterns, which might have looked even more spectacular had this been in 3-D! Awoken from his stupor by a mate they leave so Oscar can deliver drugs to a friends, but on arrival at the club, he is shot and killed. Up till now, we have seen everything through the eyes of Oscar. Literally. The camera is Oscars eyes, so we see the world as he does, we even have split second black outs that represent blinking. In a clever scene when he washes his face, as he looks in the mirror and brushes his face with his hands we get the effect here of the momentary darkness as the hand passes over the face. It is both clever and frustrating, through his drug haze the world is a little askew and it has a similar effect of motion sickness.When Oscar is killed the film and story take on a different approach. Oscar now rises above his dead body -a spirit or a ghost and goes on a journey of both the past and the current. He flies across the streets of Tokyo, often at a frenetic blur, where he watches his sister, his friends and the world. He also sees his past: his childhood, his parents death in a car crash, his separation from his sister and back to the present, where he sees his last moments as well as new events that he only witnesses in death, such as his sister viewing his dead body or her having an abortion. However, he is unseen and can't interact with the people he sees. Eventually the film suggests that through a conception, he his born again. The visual element too changes: the image is far clearer and less motion sickness inducing, although during moments where he flies quickly, it is a little disconcerting.As a visual film, this tops the list, it's imaginative, full on, clever, over the top and in some parts extreme. It is however at times too much: the warning that the film contains strobe effects (mostly during the opening titles) seems to mislead, when the film contains much more harsh visual effects. Oscars trip in his apartment does produce some beautiful effects and after his death there are some stunning shots of Tokyo, of neon clad models of the city or a glass and chandelier filled bar. The images of the past are presented with more clarity than anything else, but eventually those scenes and the present and future overlap and become flashbacks and forwards.The dialogue also adds a different dynamic: in the start it is normal, but after his death, dialogue is often very loud or we hear conversations way before we see the actual event. At times this works, but the constant repeating of the style becomes very grating at points. The story, as such, is very simple, though some may say there is a deeper meaning, but I don't see it. It is an interesting concept, that, after death we witness both the past and the present, but because we never get enough time to really spend with Oscar in life and everything we learn about him and his sister is through the eyes of him as a ghost, it is very difficult to connect with either them or the story. And as Oscar in death never speaks on what he is seeing, there is little understanding on how he feels. Another problem is that the film if far too long. It dragged so much that I was constantly checking my watch to see how far the film had to go and that's something I never do. It could well have worked by being 40minutes shorter. Maybe even an hour.The film spends so much time taking us on a journey, complete with it's dizzying array of visuals, camera work and colour, that it doesn't seem to remember to try and give the audience a more in-depth story. The film will alienate many from the outset, yet I'm surprised to read comments that's it's excessively graphic, especially sexually, but I actually feel that whilst there's plenty of sex, it's through the death haze eyes of Oscar which makes it less graphic and it's certainly a lot tamer than Noe's last feature Irreversible. In fact the drug use and sex don't phase me and though at times my stomach and brain wanted out, the issue I have is that whilst technically the film is quite an achievement, at some 2½ hrs long without much of a plot, it's just not worth the trip.More of my reviews at my site iheartfilms.weebly.com",Enter the Void
55,Michael Kenmore,"Good for the first 1/2 hour, then went downhill with pure indulgence...",2,23 January 2010,"** Some spoilers, but nothing major **I saw this film at Sundance Film Festival (at the famous Tower Theatre), and my expectation has been met. That Argentine-born French director Gasper Noe goes farther with more ""artistic"" freedom with each successive film.I've seen I Stand Alone, which I thought reeked of absurd indulgence, and Irreversible, which is dazzlingly weird and morally perplexing. I give Monsieur Noe credit for being wildly unconventional and creative with bizarre cinematography and editing that accomplish the mood as intended. Like Kubrick, anyone is incapable of imitating Noe's style with fresh relevance to the meat of the otherwise simple story, because it's his unique style that stands out from hack works by other contemporary filmmakers.Enter the Void is more of a director's film, because it's overlong (so long some tedium is felt (intended or not), and at least half an hour could be trimmed without losing story's essence; more on that later) and, because he could make a film to his specification as he pleases, base in artistic excess, audiences' plea for respect be damned.From the opening credit, which is superbly creative (one of the best opening credit sequences I've seen), to the death of a protagonist to reminiscences to the reincarnation, it's a dazzling experience in one sitting, on only one condition. The condition is you have to bear the blunt of the unbelievably explicit sexual content with some profoundly disturbing thematic elements that will rankle your nerve on the philosophical question of ethics, values, mortality -- not to mention human sexuality.In other words, you must be prepared to partake in the experience. I expected and it disturbed me to an extent, exactly as Noe intended. However, I think Noe went way too far with explicit sexual content that detract from the cinematic visual splendor and story. This film is borderline pornographic towards the ending, which is so discomforting and gross it's banal. For that reason I rate it low. Too indulgent for the sake of offending the audience's mores as maximally as possible.I expect a story, not indulgence for the sake of art. Lengthy ""Love Hotel"" sequence -- 10 minutes long or so -- will be synonymous with sheer indulgence in ""artistic excess,"" if that should convey a meaning. It's not art -- it's meaningless to point of obscenity.The first half hour with the wild opening credit and protagonist's point of view in drug experience, interaction, and spirit traveling around with the screen filled entirely of rapid flashing lights for seconds, as well as impressive single-shot scene involving cinematic tricks for seamless POV, has merit in terms of worth seeing.But when the scene involves the protagonist's sister in the dressing room at the nightclub, with a sleazy Japanese club owner, that's when the momentum begins to wear off and film progresses to never-ending disturbing crescendos; it continues for way too long that tests the audience's will and grit to tolerate the repetitive and disorienting flyovers and often indulgent scenes.The measure of indulgence causes harm to the film's supposed artistic pretenses later. The more indulgent, the more it became absurd and tedious.There is no doubt Enter the Void will be a hit as a cult film for the small audience because of weird drug scenes in POV, like when hippies would smoke marijuana to get baked while watching 2001: A Space Odyssey. A good artistic merit as we see what the point of view from a drug-induced mind is like.But the film, overall, is simply too damn indulgent for its own good. It loses merit as a film that concludes with a gross intercourse POV scene leading to a ham-fisted metaphorical ending.Certainly a pretentious and obscene film, and I'm sure the majority of native French people thought Noe is nuts for going too far with the realm of film-making as an art form. Because France led the cinematic movement with innovations and pleasant aesthetics in early 20th century, 21st century French film devolves to obscenity for art's sake to satisfy the artist's narcissistic curiosity to stretch the limitation of tolerance in the audience's mores, just like English painter Jenny Saville.They try too hard to provoke because it's part of their ego -- the need to exist by pissing off people as many as can be, and still get some praise and derision. They specialize in polarization. Enter the Void fits this description like a glove, and Noe takes pride in extending art to the cutting edge of palpable obscenity as raw emotive art to guage our mores at visceral, spiritual, and moral level in an effort to mock mere respectable decency in common humanity.If you want to protect your decent humanity, walk out when the aforementioned scene appear. It becomes nihilistic in undermining your belief in humanity, the way Noe intends because he doesn't care who and where you are. All that matters is how you perceive the world if the film will affect you. Those who are able to sit through the film with iron-clad stomach deserve being congratulated for tolerance, with individual humanity intact upon leaving theatre.* 1/2 out of 4",Enter the Void

58,RomanJamesHoffman,New French Extremity turns metaphysical,8,27 July 2014,"More than any film I have seen since '2001: A Space Odyssey', Gaspar Noe's 'Enter the Void' is a film which is not watched, it is experienced. However, where Kubrick's Magnum Opus is saturated with a late sixties optimism that leaves the viewer in awe of creation by the end, Noe seems to have taken a more Freudian approach and leaves the viewer traumatised and brutalised by the violent and empty cycle of birth, life, and death. And yet, saying this, the film is not without a certain strange consolation.This should not come as that much of a surprise to those who have seen Noe's previous movies: back in 1998, the Argentinian born French film-maker released his debut feature 'I Stand Alone', a brutal tale of a butcher-gone-mad which thrilled a few and appalled a few others but managed to fit in nicely with the nascent New French Extremity movement. He followed this up in 2001 with his international art-house ""hit"" 'Irreversible' which managed to boast the star power of both Vincent Cassel and Monica Bellucci and secured its international reputation with a seven minute plus rape scene. How did he follow this up? Well, an alinear hallucinogenic out-of-body experience based on 'The Tibetan Book of the Dead' set in the seedy underbelly of Tokyoobviously.At the beginning of the film we are introduced to Oscar, a young drug-abusing American adrift in Tokyo who has an unfortunate run-in with the Japanese police when he goes to sell some drugs. Shot dead in the toilet, we see his spirit leave his body and in this state he is able to traverse space and time as he revisits various events (both idyllic and traumatic) in his life, mostly in relation to his relationship with his sister who has also descended into the Tokyo underworld. In this way, he is able to recapitulate his life and the viewer is able to piece together the shattered mess Oscar called his life. By the end, his spirit floats over the mass of the already hallucinogenic sprawl of the Tokyo metropolis and he watches various copulating couples, waiting to choose the right moment to reincarnate.At least, this is one possible interpretation. Another is that the whole thing is a DMT inspired death thrall and nothing more spiritual than that. Whatever your metaphysical leaning in this regard, the film is both a visual masterpiece which needs to be seen to be believed and an exploration of the limits of cinematic narrative. A couple of minus points could be that it is fractionally too long and that it contains too much sex. To counter this, I would argue that as this is arguably breaking new ground in representations of life and death on film we shouldn't really judge it too harshly as it's doubtful that reincarnation would take a tidy 90 minutes. As for the sex, I would argue that while it is copious it is not actually gratuitous as sex saturates the world around us and is for so many a refuge from the pains they endure. What's more, as for the Love Hotel sequence at the film's climax, apparently the writhing and copulating couples Oscar's spirit witnesses is supposed to occur at the moment of reincarnation as it is from these that the spirit chooses the most appropriate form to reincarnate into. Although, saying this it is understandable that the unsuspecting may struggle with the relentless graphic content and the sheer length of the movie.However, as with 'Irreversible', which behind the violence and rape is a touching and tragic love story, so with 'Enter the Void' by the end of two hours of the brutalising horrors of living and in the company of predatory shells that populate Oscar's seedy world of sex and drugs, we are left watching a moment of genuine sexual affection between Oscar's friend and his sister and are left wondering if this is Oscar's chosen reincarnation or, stripped of the metaphysics, Oscar's last wish for his sister's salvation as his drug-addled brain prepares to die. In either respect, I consider everything that came before completely necessary.It's difficult to imagine how Noe can follow up such visionary cinema. However, as I view Noe to be more as a moral philosopher working through film than a film director I am sure that whatever stylistic or narrative direction he takes in the future we will be left with a similarly touching and harrowing experience of what it means to be human.",Enter the Void
59,jimi99,the ultimate trip,8,28 January 2011,"Do not see this film because you've heard it's trippy or visually stunning, unless you have some interest in the afterlife as envisioned in the Tibetan Book of the Dead as filtered through the creative mind of Gaspar Noe. In fact, the opening credits are probably the trippiest thing about the whole film and they're over in an amazingly fast two minutes. Again, I don't think even the opening credits were intended to blow the viewer's mind as much as just wake him up for what follows.And what follows is basically 2.5 hours from the afterlife of Oscar, from his sudden violent death at a young age, through his chances at liberation into the light which he rejects, because of his karma and guilt over how he has f'ed up the lives of all those he supposedly loves or calls friend, and ending in his inevitable rebirth.The film is an ordeal and many, even those who are interested in the afterlife and ""bardo films"", may find it hard going. As Oscar's spirit floats overhead into scenes where he sees the past and present of his beloved sister, his friend Alex, his friend Victor whom he has particularly harmed, and others, including what happens to his corpse, the movement is slow and mostly silent, as befits a disembodied, earthbound spirit. These slow overhead shots are punctuated at intervals by several extremely loud, sudden shocks. This might seem gratuitous, but nothing in this film is gratuitous, even the ending, which many would deem pornographic but is entirely consistent with the Tibetan belief in the soul seeking a womb in which to be reborn. The karmic elements of the film are well thought-out, and the film's overall effect and message are profound to the viewer ready to consider them.",Enter the Void
60,tpaladino,What.,5,27 August 2012,"If you look up 'pretentious art house film' in a dictionary, you should find 'Enter The Void' as a prime example.It's a shame too, because it starts off with a very interesting story, which unfolds in a visually stunning and highly original manner. But then it completely goes off the rails and veers into the realm of self-indulgent absurdity to such an extreme that it becomes excruciatingly difficult to watch. The filmmaker was very clearly inspired by the likes of David Lynch, however the characters and settings lack the loving whimsy and craft that Lynch brings to his work which makes his absurdity both entertaining and worthwhile. A good portion of this film is just weirdness for it's own sake. Everyone involved with the production does deserve a lot of credit though, because as a technical achievement it's quite amazing. I just wish that the director would have exercised some restraint, and focused on the story more than the atmosphere. With some good editing, the storytelling and style could really shine. Some of course will view these flaws as brilliance. But there will always be a certain number of moviegoers who mistake pretense for genius, regardless of how silly it actually is. And make no mistake, most of the final act of this film is nothing but visually impressive filler, every bit as vapid as the most frivolous Michael Bay explosion. Still, I'd recommend seeing it.

That said, what could've been an interesting film got bogged down in the gratuitous sex and gore. I mean does a film really ten minutes of showing what people do at a love motel? NO!

Boredom ensues, followed by frustration.There's some really nice visual effects here, such as a regular shot that transforms into a fish-eye lens shot (I've never seen this before), and lots of cameras panning through walls, as well as interesting POV tracking shots that feel dreamy. All of this is quite exciting the first time around but when the same thing is repeated again and again, the surprisal quickly wears off. After 2 hours of circling around the same set of ideas, and the same set of visual effects, the movie starts to feel like a one trick pony.While the visuals were fresh, they also made it next to nigh impossible to develop an emotional connection with the characters. How on earth can you feel with people that you mostly see from bird's eye view, with few close-ups at all?

63,jmerlino,Modern psychedelia,7,30 October 2020,"The biggest problem with Enter the Void is that the best part - the DMT sequence - is at the beginning of the film, and however good the rest of the film might be, it all seems somewhat anticlimactic.The story, such as it is, is based around the Tibetan Book of the Dead, which is mentioned early in the film. Oscar, the protagonst, walks with his friend Alex who describes the book of the dead to him. Vastly oversimplified, after you die, you get to see the things that you did in your life, and the impact that those things had on people around you, for good or ill.We see this in an extended flashback sequence where Oscar follows himself around (we see the back of his head) revealing how things led up to his death. Then we get a long sequence of Oscar's disembodied spirit flying around Tokyo, and peeking in on various things going on.Eventually, he peeks in on his sister and Alex having sex. From here, the viewpoint simply goes into a light, with a vague hint of a pattern recalling the DMT sequence. The implication (I think) is that Oscar will be reincarnated as his sister's child.I thought the film was engrossing and definitely visually arresting. It does flag somewhat towards the end, and as I said at the outset, the most interesting stuff happens in the first half hour, which makes the rest of the movie seem a little dull by comparison.Still, I did find the story interesting enough to watch the film twice (and I'll probably watch it again).What cannot be argued with here is the technical mastery. A feature of all of Noe's films, it's front and center here. Supposedly, there's not a frame in the film that hasn't been digitally enhanced in some way. There is the usual Noe array of interesting camera angles and movements (I especially enjoyed the ascending, rotating shot of Oscar's spirit leaving his body).Personally, I thought the story was interesting enough to carry the film, but even if you disagree, there's plenty of eye candy here too. The DMT sequence is just wonderful to look at, and there are lots of cool, colorful, glowey shots of Tokyo. If you like a different kind of eye candy, there's plenty of the gorgeous Paz de la Huerta running around naked to satisfy you. (If not, rewatch the first season of Boardwalk Empire).I don't believe in an afterlife, and have not touched a psychedelic substance since college, but I still found this movie interesting and fun, and a joy to watch. The only reason I don't give it a higher rating is because of the draggy pace of the second half.",Enter the Void

65,nathanschubach,"""Citizen Kane"" on acid and more stripper poles",8,28 May 2011,"Well...what can I say. This movie is another Noe masterpiece of strangeness that pushes the boundary (once again) of cultural VS natural normals. The title is completely fitting: enter the void of these two siblings who get pushed by day to day life to the brink of survival, and witness the aftermath of a spirit gone sour. Is this all there is to life afterwards? Who knows. The visual team and choreographer deserve every movie they set out to do, because if I haven't been through the void yet after watching this film, I can't wait to see what's in store in their other movies. Like always, since Irreversible, Noe pushes the limit with the camera tricks, which takes your mind off of the needless family-eroticism issues in most of his films. I was surprised to hear mostly English throughout the film (dubbed? not sure), which made understanding the film that much easier, but the scenes told the whole story nevertheless. The thing that tripped me out the most was not the CG ""iTunes-visualization"" scenes in the beginning, but how much Noe respected their natural feeling of sibling-love in natural light, and how much the artificial light brought to them in Japan created a much more sour lifestyle. It's touches like this that make me love Gaspar Noe's films over and over. The taboos are still there, and the awkward mother/son flashbacks still exist, but the heart of the matter is that these two are just eternally searching in the void for something and out for anything to find it, unfortunately.

Deplorably, it has nothing to offer.In the beginning I hear something that sounds like Coil's ""How to Destroy Angels"". The flashing intro told me that there would be music by Coil in this movie. But what I hear after that is muffled bass drum in the background and muffled speech of the main(?) character. (You really can't tell who's who on this one.) It feels as if the movie is shot with a hand-held camera; in first-person view style.

69,j-madej,"""Enter the Void"" is directed to your subconscious mind, like DMT or LSD trip.",9,28 July 2014,"I am still contemplating the last time that I saw 'Enter the Void', or should I say reincarnate, because this is what 'Enter the Void is all about. Loosely based on the Tibetan ""The Book of Death"" it shows 5 stages of what is happening with the human soul after you die. T Gaspar Noe's film it is as surreal as you will get in today's art house cinema scene. This Argentinian director who's work has been linked to the New French Extremity, also known for his other controversial movie 'Irréversible' (in which he shows an uninterrupted 9 minutes anal rape scene of the beautiful Monica Belluci, the review of 'Irréversible' you will find below) refuses to use a standard way of telling a story. The first 45 minutes of the movie is shot from the first person perspective of the protagonist played by Nathaniel Brown.We see our protagonist smoking DMT and going into one of the most intense visual and auditory sequences in movie history. This is a 3D ride in a 2D medium with a great sound and visual design. After the protagonist gets shot by the police in a Tokio nightclub, we begin the journey through the time and space of the main character subconscious. The camera hoovers above the buildings and heads of the loved ones revisiting the most important moments in the main character's life, especially his childhood and relationship with the mother. Noe is very Freudian in this matter. As being a spirit you are able to go any place and any time, you are able to witness some intimate scenes, which in ""Enter the Void"" it's plenty. Matter of fact some scenes are borderline pornographic. In one we see an abortion, and a car crash, in another an orgy. You can see that Noe admired Kubric with his slow sexual tension, who in term admired and copied Kieslowski.The acting is not amazing but solid enough that it's not taking you out of the story. Technically this is a very well made film. I'll bet that the job of the 1st AC (Focus puller) was't easy on this one.The camera moves are continuous and the edits are hidden in the wipes ala Hitchock's ""Rope. You can see on some shots that Noe is using models to duplicate the shots flying over Tokio, but all in all this is more of an experience then a film. It's directed to your subconscious mind, like DMT or LSD trip.You might liked it, you might hated it, but you will be affected by it. It's long in 155 minutes, and might have been better if it was 30 minutes shorter, but this doesn't distract from the fact that this film is a masterpiece, with a slightly predictable ending, but the journey to get there is truly enjoyable. The only movies that come to mind when we try to compare ""Enter the Void "" to in terms of coverage are 'The diving bell and the butterfly' and maybe ""Strange Days"", specially the FPS feel of a video game. Sadly, I don't think this film is ever going to reach the mainstream audience, it is just to shocking and intellectual, but those of us who were fortunate to see it, should appreciate it as a piece of art that it is. I saw this movie 2 times by now and I experienced differently each time. This is a must see for all the cinematographers and visually thinking directors!!!!

70,lumieretrain,Enter the Void by Gaspar Noé,9,31 January 2021,"The stories about spiritual journeys after the death of one or even more characters, are some of the most complex and philosophical themes to explore in the poetry, novels, graphic novels, movies and video games. These stories usually use some colors, animals or even objects to represent them as specific symbolism, to connect with the emotions of the main characters and the supporting ones. The audience would follow these spiritual journeys, through the eyes of the main characters, like the audience are experiencing in the first person these spiritual journeys. Even the audience would often times experience some of the most unexpected moments, especially to see how far these stories will go on until the end. The provocative auteur filmmaker Gaspar Noé seems really intrigued, to make a movie about spiritual journeys. By using some of the specific technologies needed, to structure some of the most complicated visual effects, in every moment of the movie. After a long time of development, in 2009 comes out Enter the Void by Gaspar Noé. The movie's plot: In the night of Tokyo, the drug dealer Oscar (Nathaniel Brown) is betrayed by his best friend Victor (Olly Alexander) to get killed. After his death, his soul floats around the city, by observing how the people, he was close with, are moving forward. From the beginning to the end, the audience would be emerged into the spiritual journey of the main character, to be captured by the unique moments of the movie. Especially for how the movie is told most of the time, in a single long take, after the specific dramatic moment has started the spiritual journey. The movie is filled with specific lightings and colors, for some of the most atmospheric scenes, by creating visual shots to express the feelings of the main character and the supporting ones. The camera has been specifically used, to create unique camera movements to capture the most significant shots. Especially to see where the main character's soul will end up going in every part of the city, both inside and out of the several buildings, without being blocked by any obstacles. In the same way, the camera has been used to follow some other specific movements, to tell the story initially in the main character's point of view, before the tragedy happens. The editing has been elaborated to create a rhythm, which makes clear how the movie would be told, without interrupting the narration's rhythm. Especially for how the movie is told most of the time in a single long take, which makes the movie unforgettable and captivating. The visual effects have been specifically elaborated to structure some of the most complicated visual moments, needed in every single details to embrace the colors and the lightings be shown shot by shot. The whole cast have played the characters, by making clear which the specific purposes of theirs are to follow. Especially to see what the consequences of the supporting characters are going to get, after the tragedy of the main character have happened. Enter the Void is one of the greatest masterpieces of all time, as well as the best Gaspar Noé's movie.",Enter the Void
71,benowen-91207,An understandably mixed reception,9,21 July 2020,"Enter The Void is not everyone's thing, I can imagine a lot of people hating this film and finding it to be more style over substance. Although the style steals the show in this movie, the masterful thing about it is that the style IS the substanceStarting with the films greatest quality : the cinematography. The film looks fantastic and is filmed in a way I have never seen before. Some of the shots are absolutely mind boggling just in how they were executed. It reminded me of 'Birdman' in how each shot would go on for long amounts of time.Most surprisingly is that the camera seems to tell the story of the film much better than the script ever could. If you look at the story from a linear perspective, it's nothing that great, but it's the camera that really helps it out.I have two problems with the film in-particular, first of all is the actress of Linda. Yes, her breakdown scene at the end when Victor comes to apologise is really well performed, but for the most part her vocal delivery was really bugging me. She sounded as if she was constantly intoxicated for the majority of the film, even during the scenes where she is sober.My second big issue is the ending. It's safe to say that Gasper Noë shows a lot of sex in his movies, and this film is no different. I would defend sex in movies if it has any narrative significance or is somewhat important. However, the ending of the film seemed like straight up pornography, it was gratuitous for seemingly no reason. The most important part of that scene was Lidia conceiving Alex's child, which I admit closes the theme of life and death quite wellEnter the Void isn't an experience I would recommend to most people as it is incredibly heavy and dark, but I can't deny that the film is a masterpiece in its own sense

73,Felonious-Punk,Same Noé formula: lonely philosophy mixed with trippy drug effects,5,9 February 2011,"""How about if we make a movie that tries to sum up every part of life, every single part from the very first moment of conception to the very last moment of death? We can use strobe-light effects and depict crashes, all sorts of dead bodies, drug addicts and sex addicts. Maybe if we try to make people so sick and tired of everything that human existence has to offer, it'll cause them to want to evolve and find some higher purpose, a better way of living. We'll show everything even the boring, repetitive parts of life. Yeah! We can make life better by showing its worst."" This is the conversation I imagine writer/director Noé had when he came up with the idea for this movie. Non-coincidently, it's the same conversation I imagine inspired his last movie.My problem with this movie is that it's not as tight nor as thrilling as ""Irreversible"" (2002). It lacks the relentless rhythm and originality of purpose. It starts out well enough, even suggesting that it may be an even more powerful work, that its momentum will build, but it never does. Instead, it falls flat at the halfway point, and then ends up dragging its feet for the rest of its length. Its the same dreary ideas in slightly different situations, which would be all right if only his characters were more realistic and had a chance to really interact. His movies have been showing us stick figures, roughly-drawn sketches of people to show his lonely cosmology: one person alone in the universe who doesn't trust love. I still have hope for Noé, though. Even though the only emotions he has mastered are loneliness and panic, this movie shows a crack in his iron-clad facade. There are a couple short scenes that seem to want to get deep and gritty in the relationship between real human personalities. The scenes are too few and too short however to make this the masterpiece that Noé always thinks he's making. As they stand, they make the rest of the movie seem flat and unispired in comparison. But the point is I think he's maturing. I think there's a chnce he may soon settle down for longer than a minute, quit with all the bright flashing lights and colors, the whizzes, booms, pops, and bangs, and in time actually allow us in, instead of trying to scare us back away from the screen.In the meantime, we can marvel over his technical talent, though optically-scarring it may be. And there other things to like here, as well. The best child performance of the year is here. The best credits sequence is here. The best Cinematography, the best Art Direction, the best Special Effects, the best Sound Editing and Sound Mixing.

The commercial was very vague about the plot, all it said was that it was something to do with the afterlife and now afterwards i see why. This movie is shocking, hallucinogenic, and metaphysical, and it will leave you feeling as though you actually died watching it, a similar feeling to watching the matrix for the first time and thinking you're stuck in the matrix. It questions the very nature of human experience, consciousness, life and death and does it in this traumatizing, very personal way. The entire film is shot from first person, some through the eyes of the main character, some as an out of body experience, and some--well, its probably best not to say so you can see for yourself. And the visual effects are spectacular, using a style of cinematography i've never actually seen before... somewhat like the infinite zoom from limitless. I was smoking weed while watching this film but it made me feel like i was on a whole other drug entirely.EPILEPTICS BEWARE!!!!!! This movie does have a lot of strobing light, and it does it to induce a drug like state. Make sure you're in a comfortable spot, because it is one hell of a trip. And don't watch this movie on acid.

Before I continue I must point out that this film is NC-17. Plot: An American teenage drug dealer is killed in Tokyo. He sees his life pass before his eyes and then comes back as a ghost to watch over his sister as a result of a pact they made long ago when their parents died. A majority of the film is seen from the main character's eyes(when he is alive) which gives us a look at what he is seeing under the influence of hallucinogenic drugs. This is extremely trippy yet beautiful. (On a side note, if you a prone to having seizures, I strongly advise that you avoid watching this.) It is also shot from top-down view which gives us the feeling of hovering over the characters. It's extremely lengthy takes make this movie more amazing. The cenimatography is one of the best things about this movie. But what I found VERY creepy is the fact that the brother and sister are a little too close. Nothing physical is ever shown but it's sort of implied that the sister loves her brother a little too much. I must also say I found the abortion scene and the overly graphic sex scenes to be a little much. Also there is a ten minute long scene towards the end that made me feel extremely uncomfortable sitting there watching it. Yet I applaud director Gaspar Noe for going all out and holding back nothing. Even though there are some very explicit scenes, they don't dull the film's brilliance and I will say it is one the best films I've seen in while. This is one of those movies that you must see before you die and sitting through the uncomfortable parts is well worth it. I am deeply considering buying it on Blu-ray.

78,anthonydavis26,Partly redeeming visuals,3,25 June 2011,"This review was made following the late-night screening at Cambridge Film Festival (September 2010):This wasn't (pun intended) deVoid of interest in its visuals, but it really was far too long (unless, of course, one's notion of time was as blurred by artificial means as that of most of the 'characters').I have put that word in inverted commas, because they were largely so banal in what they thought or had to say to each other that to maintain any interest or for them to have any credibility was, for me, difficult, and I tended not to care what happened to them. The fact that those feelings carried over to the male lead, and that he was highly lacking in any impulse that wasn't related to incest, was not a good point in that respect. Having said which, the write-up clearly stated that this was a sensual experience, not an intellectual one.That being said, some of the dialogue was both so lacking in any spark of imagination and so poorly acted that it was just embarrassing, but perhaps that was down to the presence on both occasions of an actor playing a son who had found out that a friend had had closer relations than he liked with his mother: although he was singularly worse than everyone else in both scenes, their delivery of some truly dire material was hardly compelling, and just made one laugh despairingly at what one was seeing, or even cringe (even if no one can see you with the lights out).The visuals, including some editing tricks and morphing that were highly effective, redeemed the 2 h 25 mins that were taken up by this event, but there was still a lot of predictability and redundancy that just had me looking to see what the time was, and hoping that it wouldn't be much longer before I could get to the bar.",Enter the Void

I don't think any of these two things are the strong points of the film. And to think they are is to miss the point of the film.Watching this is not really much like watching a movie. Its more like stepping into a set of experiences. Through those experiences we see a more fluent view of life, but mostly death.A few of the things tackled in this movie include abortion, death by truck, death by policemen, birth, tripping, whore houses, incest, eating from garbage cans, and many more things all splattered with neon and glow in the dark images.Any film that really delves into the subject of death in any serious way is automatically good. There have been only a few that have done this (A Seventh Seal comes to mind as one). This film is one among those. The film is very much catered to the life of the mind of the youth. In the prime of one's youth, the most frightening thing is to see life end. When life is good and plentiful there is no need to seek any higher or more fulfilling existence. All that is needed is what is now. All that is to lose is everything. When you have lost life, you have entered the void.",Enter the Void
83,K-nightt,Psychoanalysis on crack (or is it DMT...),10,8 October 2010,"I need to write this review in the wake of having seen the film. The primordial notion behind it is rebirth, but rebirth not only in the actual reincarnated physical sense, as is ultimately consummated, but also rebirth in the sense of being reintegrated with the breast; the notion of incest is absolutely pulsating throughout the entire film, and the metamorphosis of characters experienced throughout the sexual encounters is brutally direct in this sense. It would seem that the dream-like state one is immersed in after death is what allows the maximal realization of this basic instinctive drive, since it would be a state in which all repression is lifted, and desire can be experienced in its purest, most raw form without the nay-saying psychic censor beeping like crazy. This is clearly too threatening for a conscious ""normal"" person to face up to in their everyday experience, thus dreams and reality are distorted to conform to our particular compromise formations, allowing us to live day-to-day without being overburdened by the anxiety of facing our sexual urges head-on.In its analytic scope, the Oedipal ties are clearly laid out as unresolved; the little boy experiences the death of his parents with detachment, the death of the rival (his father) and of his love object (his mother) occurring simultaneously, a kind of reverse deus ex machina operating in a perverse way, the rival is killed but in a way that destroys the princess they were fighting over. The impotence he experiences (double meaning) carries its weight retroactively in the notion that his mother tells him that she loves Oscar and his father, but in ""very different ways"", the Lacanian notion of ""the name of the father"" rearing its ugly head, the mother loves something the son can never provide to her (the phallus), thus the sexualized love cannot be realized. But in a moment of utmost mirroring of the father figure, Oscar enters the body of the father and sees himself through his eyes, watching his mother contort during sex and seeing ""little Oscar"" at the door, watching his parents.As the mother figure died, Oscar must appeal to the next best thing in line, the mother's daughter And the pact to remain faithful to his sister creates a sublimated metaspace that permits the diluted enactment of his desire to be engulfed and reattached to the primordial breast, at least as a promise. Linda apparently shares in some kind of dynamic of her own, as she kisses her brother in a sensuous way, she herself living her own Elektra symbolism through Oscar. Anyway, as Oscar enters the head of Alex, the rule-free realm of the symbolic permits him to experience his fantasy of incest with his sister, turned mother (in a flash), turned sister The morbid desire for fulfillment compels him to enter for a brief period into the aborted fetus his sister produced, even the split and murdered off component of his sister representing a possibly desired destiny. Truly the ""come inside me"" line almost in itself justifies choosing English as the primary language for this film, and the encapsulated space of his sister's uterus creates the holding environment for the engulfment to occur attached at last; the most poignant moment is when the baby is still attached to his sister (or is it his mother?) by the umbilical cord and is brought to the nipple, which is the only element seen clearly (this was a very smart move, from all standpoints, as a baby's eyesight is 20/400 at birth). This moment brings to a close the consummation of Oscar's fantasy, and thus is reborn in a literal sense as well as through purposeful incestuous regression. The unity engendered and its inherent hope are fractured with the cutting of the cord, at which moment the baby immediately starts crying and is taken away, the promise of eternal bondage destroyed thus again, entering the void of an existence deprived of any enduring physical contact, regardless of how many times one reincarnates, even when one enacts their most basic forbidden wishes. On a more controversial note, perhaps Linda experienced the feeling of completeness in herself as well; her desire to possess the phallus of her brother/father becoming alive in a bizarre way. As a female entity she became whole by producing a phallus (satisfying the dispelled notion of ""penis envy""), and with a mind-twisting denouement she not only possesses but produces the familial phallus she so longed for, finding peace at last.",Enter the Void

85,manisimmati,A Contrived Audiovisual Orgy,3,17 May 2017,"""Enter the Void"" is the cinematic equivalent of an epileptic fit. Beginning with the opening credits, Argentinian director Gaspar Noé seeks to overwhelm us with frantic flickering and humming. Then we are thrown into the first-person perspective of Oscar, a drug dealer in Tokyo. But that doesn't last for long, because poor Oscar gets betrayed by a friend and ambushed by the police. He flees to the toilet of the eponymous bar ""The Void"", where he gets shot. From this point on, the camera represents Oscar's soul, whirling through Tokyo and waiting for some kind of redemption or resurrection.When you watch ""Enter the Void"", you might be tricked into thinking it is art. But actually, it is the exact opposite: It is trash masquerading as art. Behind its flashy façade, there is not much to be said about the substance of this movie. Noé focuses on one single gimmick and does it to death until the audience is frustrated, nauseated or (in my case) bored. Don't get me wrong. Of course it can be interesting to challenge and even torment the audience of a movie. Look at Lars von Trier's work, or Nicolas Winding Refn's ""Only God Forgives"". Although ""Only God Forgives"" is deeply flawed, at least it has some kind of mystery to it, whereas ""Enter the Void"" is literally devoid of any meaning. Its style is one-sided and its story shockingly trivial.There are some redeeming factors. The sex scenes feel sensual and real in a way the rest of the movie doesn't. An incestuous relationship between Oscar and his sister Linda is frequently hinted at, which gives ""Enter the Void"" an emotional center, albeit a very blurred one. If you just want a different or extreme experience, you might enjoy Noé's visual orgy. But if you expect a finely nuanced and truly artistic movie, don't bother with this one.",Enter the Void

87,bradleybean86,Examine the 'Agony of Ecstacy',9,16 November 2012,"On the surface this movie may seem like it glorifies drugs; I certainly wouldn't recommend watching it to people struggling with active addiction or are in early recovery from narcotics or alcohol; as this is what A.A. members would say is 'A Trigger!'It certainly is effective at keeping your attention, then causing you to wonder if your mind has lost its train of thought or if you're just 'missing something.' The only negative thing I will say about this movie is that it takes itself way too seriously, and does come off as self- important.These filmmakers have not reinvented the wheel they have simply taken a very creative leap in what I, personally, would describe as a hyper- speed David Lynch. Although many may not see the parallel; (the distinctiveness in mood and ambiguously chronological progression/regression) remind me very much of Twin Peaks : Fire Walk With Me. So many movies portray the subject of addiction in an assumed, unresearched way. I'm not saying that a director or screenwriter needs to take drugs in order to explore the topic, he could obviously confer and consort with people who are or have lived 'that life'I would never personally have the balls to indulge in the types of sensory/reality trippy stuff our main character does. But I was young once, I partied hardy, and was lucky as hell to have the opportunity to recover over 3 years ago almost. This movie, for myself, is a wicked trip down memory lane. You don't need to be high to experience this movie, it effectively creates that feeling very early on and maintains throughout.one of the many evil paradoxes of addiction progression is that it incubates in your subconscious, and is often activated unbeknownst when the person is the most emotionally fragile. This is not a PSA either, I am for 420 legalization and decriminalization of drug crimes that are victimless.some parts may seem too long or redundant, and it runs an awful long time so be realistically prepared to take an intermission, or pregame. One of the few movies of recent that felt like a rewarding experience.sidenote: DEFINITELY not for people that are seizure prone (had me wondering if i was... evil directors)",Enter the Void
88,armin-durakovic,"Very artistic movie, but a bit to long",8,31 March 2012,"This movie is very sensual and artistic. It has great shots, the filming technique is very unique and editing is awesome, as well. The complete visual appearance and the sound in the background give You a deep, introspective experience of the main character Oscar, who is dead in the first half hour of the movie. The remaining two hours of the movie, You (as Oscar) travel out of the body and watch the scenes after the death. Through the retrospective view, the film keeps you more interested, but for my taste, the story was a bit too hard and too much tragic. I watched the movie in three parts, the creativity of filming was too good to stop it watching, but the frustrating scenes and the tempo of the story was too slow and some scenes could be easily just cut off to improve the quality of the movie. As well, the duration of the movie is just too much to watch it in cinema. The shots of Tokio were just great, and I recommend the movie to all photography fans and artistic people, but the movie needs You to be in a mood to watch it.",Enter the Void
89,chaaa,"Crazy, but technically brilliant!",7,14 September 2010,"In a nutshell, Gaspar Noe's often exasperating but always visionary Enter the Void follows a man on his journey from his last hours on earth, through his death and his journey into the afterlife. The first twenty minutes or so follows Oscar as he takes a hit of DMT (a very potent hallucinogen) and goes on a visually arresting, if slightly over-long trip. He then leaves his house to give his friend a stash of drugs he owes him only to be chased and shot by police when he gets there. From there, his death and afterlife mirrors the philosophies behind the Tibetan Book of the Dead which theorises (I'm sure I'm putting this very crudely) that one's soul floats around, watching the world without them until they figure out how to leave their old life behind and move on. To recommend this film to audiences is perhaps a wrong turn, as it is bound to strike most as indulgent, immoral, needlessly vulgar and uncomfortable (particularly in Oscar's tendency to watch his sister having sex whenever possible). However, with suitably forewarning, this is a film that any self-respecting cinephile should make a point of seeing, and especially on the big screen.Noe proved with Irreversible that he was a technical genius and that his eye for original visuals knows no bounds. He also proved that he wasn't afraid to shock his audience and has quite the nasty streak running through his stories. In both visual content and shock factor, Irreversible was merely a precursor to his magnum opus Enter the Void. With an endless stream of nasty images and depressingly dead-eyed unpleasantness, it is difficult to feel anything for any of the characters, but none of this dampens the impact of Noe's probing, soaring, spectral camera as it floats in and out of lives and deaths. I don't know if it has ever been done before but the camera-as-spirit conceit is highly effective and one which puts a very interesting moral spin on the voyeurism of this film. Noe takes voyeurism to extreme, as Oscar's spirit jumps in and out of bodies in often very unusual and even shocking circumstances.The trouble with Enter the Void is that it is difficult sometimes to know whether to laugh or be shocked. Some of the content is pretty outrageous and even quite silly. However, for every roll of the eyes, there is a gasp of astonishment in terms of the intensity of the cinematic experience. Having now seen this film twice (it premiered at JDIFF 2010 in February), I must say I was pleased to see some superfluous scenes towards the end cut out, giving the film a somewhat more streamlined effect.Your tolerance for Noe's self-indulgence will most likely decide your level of enjoyment of this, a film I imagine will very much divide audiences, but it is at the very least a visual milestone that should be seen on as big a screen as possible (though somehow I can't see this one gracing Screen 1 in the Savoy anytime soon). A flawed piece, but one flooded with moments of genius.",Enter the Void
90,CinemaPat,"""I don't do drugs, I am drugs"" - Salvador Dali",9,9 December 2010,"Gaspar Noé has created his most ambitious journey with the latest addition to his already stellar filmography. Noé's new film ""Enter The Void"" explores what happens when you die and attempts to bring the audience into the ""psychedelic"" and near/post death experience. While this is his most technologically impressive and aspiring film it is not his best. In fact, it is the worst of his catalog but that isn't to say it is bad, it's just not as incredible as his other films. Noé has stated this film was inspired by psychedelic experiences and the ""Tibetan Book of The Dead"" which discusses the death experience including re-birth. He even traveled to the Amazon to experience one of the most powerful psychedelics known, ""Ayahuasca"". Noé laughingly stated this was for ""professional research"".Newcomer Nathanial Brown plays ""Oscar"", an American 20 something living in Tokyo trying to make ends meet by selling drugs. Him and his sister ""Linda"" played by a sultry Paz De la Huerta are orphans from a horrific car crash when they were children. Oscar has a slight obsession with breasts, psychedelic drugs, and inappropriate relationships; including one with his sister. The story is told in three parts, first showing Oscar's point of view as he takes DMT and deals drugs. Second, we are in the POV of Oscar's soul after being shot, re-living the events leading up to his demise. In this section, we learn that he has managed to move his sister out to Tokyo where she has becomes a stripper. We witness the car crash that took their parents and learn about his ""awkward"" relationship with Linda. Third, we see Oscar's soul traveling the city watching over his sister as he promised her that he will ""never leave her"". The ending is ambiguous, but most of his films are; though for the first time that I know of, he revealed in a few interviews big hints as to what really happens. So be careful if you are reading interviews prior to watching the film.As with most of Noé's films, ETV attempts to alter the viewer's perception through the use of sound and visuals. ""I Stand Alone"" and ""Irreversible"" were both filmed in this way and both managed to completely engross me into the characters psyche. In ""Enter The Void"", Noé attempts this right off the bat in the opening credit sequence. He uses an industrial trance song from the England techno group ""LFO"". Partnered with pulsating lights and text, he essential brings the audience into a psychedelic ""trip"". Some will be immediately turned off by this beginning sequence as it is almost seizure inducing but those who stick it out are in for a treat. The soundtrack was an integral part as well. There was music, but mostly it was background noise and what I think was Binaural Tones. Binaural Tones or Beats are low frequency sounds meant to alter the brain waves in an effort to change perception. If there is any truth to this phenomenon, I think the audience experiences it first hand while watching.Noe uses the same technique as he did in ""Irreversible"" having the camera float above and transition through solid objects. This was one of the few things I didn't like about the movie. I felt like I had seen it before and that he wasn't presenting anything new. The floating aside, he did managed to show me something I have never seen before. The POV technique. I couldn't believe what I was watching when Oscar was standing in the mirror washing his face. The camera blacked out perfectly in sync with when Oscar puts his hands over his eyes. It was fascinating to watch, in fact there are many camera shots in the film that left my jaw dropped.The script was great but some of the performances were not. I was surprised by this since all of his previous films were incredibly acted. Noé stated in an interview that there was a lot of improvisation on set in regards to the script. I can't help but think maybe this had something to do with the poor acting. I suppose the improvisation helped the film seem more real, but it just felt forced. One standout for me was the actress who plays the younger version of Linda. Emily Alyn Lind sent chills down my spine with her portrayal of a child witnessing her parents horrific death.Another surprising, but welcome change is that this movie wasn't very violent. Pretty much all of Noé's previous feature films scared the hell out of me. This trip was different, though he still featured graphic sex as he tends to do in all of his films. But this movie isn't about sex and violence. At it's heart it is about the unknown (death) and shows the collective experience of many people over many centuries (psychedelics). Early in the film Oscars friend ""Alex"", played by Cyril Roy, mentions that the chemical in with DMT and Ayahuasca is in the human body already. He says that when you die the DMT is released essentially giving you the ""hardest trip"" you can get. My theory is that Noe wanted to show the effect of taking DMT recreationally (Oscar's first person view of a DMT trip early in the film) and the effect of DMT naturally occurring at the moment of death. A brilliant concept that he pulled off flawlessly.As with most of his films, this is not for everyone. You have to be able to appreciate the craft of movie making to really understand the technical accomplishment this film was. Some critics have said this is ""style over substance"", but I disagree. The film has its faults, yes, but it is enjoyable and captivating. I've never seen anything like it and honestly probably never will. Gaspar Noé is one of the best directors in the world today, I can't wait to see what he thinks up next.",Enter the Void
91,sandiglendinning,A psychedelic journey through consciousness,8,13 June 2013,"Before I begin I will state emphatically that this is a film that you're either going to love by the end or you will dislike intensely. Enter the Void (whichever way it is viewed), is a brave bit of work born of a creative mind with a vision belonging to an individual who presumably does not care deeply about commercial success.Oscar is a young drug dealer living in Tokyo with his sister. After reading possibly the most inappropriate book ever in consideration of what is about to happen to him next (the Tibetan Book of the Dead), Oscar sets about mashing his poor old brain up with a dirty great dose of DMT. Following this, a deal goes awry and he suddenly finds himself on the wrong side of dead. From here the out of body consciousness of Oscar becomes the focus of the remainder of the film, in primarily first person perspective. He experiences flashbacks to his childhood and his recent past whilst weaving around the fall-out that his death has caused in the present. Oscar's anger, frustration and deep sadness are by some inconceivable means successfully conveyed during this process, making for a truly unique piece of thought provoking entertainment.The narrative of this movie is very much overshadowed by it's intense and visually jarring cinematography which deserves a special mention for it's mind-boggling intensity. The musical score is interesting and feels organic and and dreamy. I honestly have no idea how some of the visual effects were achieved though I strongly suspect that they were a labour of love. This visual styling lends itself very well to the subject matter of the story and embellishes it leading the viewer to almost physically sense some of what the lead character is experiencing. At times, it's almost tiring to watch but without these intense effects the film could arguably not succeed in allowing the viewer to feel what Oscar feels.If you have ever had an experience with hallucinogenic drugs, you're probably going to like this. If you like to watch something a bit different and are prepared to invest the time and patience to let this film draw you in- you will be richly rewarded. All in all Enter the Void is something unique, intelligent and memorable, you really need to experience it yourself in order to understand how.8/10",Enter the Void

Then I saw who directed it, Gaspar Noé. I've seen Irreversible and must say it was overrated garbage, but there were a few scenes that very well done. Many people think that Gaspar Noe's films are artistic and inspiring, but I only see them as a cheap gimmick. Throughout Enter the Void, there is a blend of great shoots and then the worst closeups of a florescent light or wall that just sits there for over 5 minutes. I really felt the movie had only a few important scenes then the rest was just music video, screensaver, nonsense.Reading the summary, ""A drug-dealing teen is killed in Japan, after which he reappears as a ghost to watch over his sister."" is not a good description at all. It was more like ""Drug- dealing teen brother and sister are in a weird love relationship, brother dies, sister gets pregnant from Japanese thug, brother is reborn""....The movie just forces you to watch unpleasant situations and calls it art. If you are a fan of this film and watching unpleasant rape scenes then this film is for you, but you need to have your hard drive checked by the FBI if you truly enjoyed this film.Rating = D-VideoGameHollywood.com",Enter the Void

Whilst I didn't enjoy Noe's first film I Stand Alone, I loved Irreversible.There is lots to like about ETV and much to dislike as well. An hour into the film and I would have given it perhaps an eight or nine but by the end of the film I was frustrated. Why? Noe just can't help himself and you get the feeling he either didn't know how to end the film or simply just wanted to be shocking for the sake of it.Visually, I couldn't help but be impressed. Some amazing shots, lighting (strobe) and editing techniques. Noe also mixes up the story well as he did in Irreversible. You are not spoon fed the story and I love the way he told the back story of the two leads.Plenty of people walked out at the screening after the hour and forty minute mark and I couldn't blame them. Probably not because they were shocked but just bored and frustrated. Noe pads this out and it is such a shame as overall it ruined the film as a whole.The acting is quite wooden and doesn't ring true but that is only a minor quibble when compared to the film's bloated running time.Hard to fault Noe for his creativity, energy and style and refusal to follow norms in terms of narrative structure etc. Still, I wish a friend or colleague had tapped him on the shoulder or given him some constructive criticism about the last half of the film.I can only imagine how much footage Noe might add into a Directors Cut - Lord help us.

The main character is not really a character; he is an audience surrogate in the purest sense. The audience sees everything from his point of view, experiences his entire life as it flashes on the screen. While I know several people who hate this movie, I just don't see anything to hate.

It's a relatively simple story, once you remove the flash and ignore most of the resurrection/drug culture going on - which is fairly superficial anyway. The intensity of the emotions and experiences of the orphans is really what makes the movie worth watching for me - you can feel they've had a disturbing life - deep in your guts. Which then becomes sort of OK - as you see them coming to terms with death and what comes next - things happened as pretty much every character in the movie is broken - the trip somehow providing closure to all involved.

104,otuswerd,Get ready....,10,13 August 2010,"...for this is not your typical film. But i am sure that most of you on here know that by now. I was able to see this at the Walter Reade Theater in NYC this past Wednesday. Gaspar Noe was there with Nathaniel Brown and Paz de la Huerta for some Q&A after the viewing. We saw the ""directors cut"" and Noe was glad we saw it in that theater because it is said to have the best movie theater sound in NYC. I have been following this for about a year now and I thought I would know what to expect..but I was wrong. This film for me played with my emotions. It seems to be a movie about family. The bond a family has and the loss of family..on many different levels. Being a parent I could say that maybe it effected me differently then if you don't have a child. I enjoyed spending time with the characters, watching different events in their lives unfold. I especially enjoyed the characters of Bruno, Mario, Victor and Alex. All of them played an important role in the downfall of Oscar and Linda..and as the story is told, I was very curious about what was happening or what will happen to them. Noe takes us to a dark place, a very dark place, as he did in Irreversible. But this time its candy coated in hallucinatory visuals created by dimethyltryptamine. Everything is beautiful, bright, shimmering yet we are in some of the bowels of the earth. This film, I feel, is not as violent as his past two. Though there are some gruesome images in it, they are things that happen in life, a car accident, an abortion, he just takes us to that place and let's us watch. Knowing that Marc Caro worked on design of this film is just so amazing and you can see it throughout the film.The story does go back and forth in moments of the lead characters lives. But by the end I wasn't quite sure if it was all just some heavy trip or what was going on was real. Noe does an amazing job at blending and mixing the story together, you are interested in every second of what is happening. I will be seeing this again when it comes out in September and I am very interested to see what they cut out. It would be a shame kinda to see it altered from what we saw this past week...the movie was perfect in every aspect.

105,jtprius510,A Unique Look At Death,7,20 October 2011,"Years from now, Gaspar Noe's Enter The Void is going to be that film that everyone loves to hate. Lovers of this instant cult classic are going to have trouble finding reasons in their heads to watch it over again. And for those that need help finding one, my top three reasons to watch this over again are probably going to be either to host a party, show somebody a film they have never seen before, or to give that special someone a reason to remember you by, or a reason to leave you where you stand altogether. This is definitely a film that will stick to anyone you show it to, and if your name is what you want associated with Enter The Void, be the first to show your friends Noe's latest film.Set in the underworld of Tokyo Japan, the engine of Enter The Void's story line is driven purely by the event of the protagonists death. With that said besides a few lines uttered by him at the beginning of this film, the main character has no lines, so all we have left as an audience to judge him by are his actions and Noe shows his actions through the memories he has of his own life which inevitably lead up to the beginning of this film. With his shots made from an all knowing type of helicopter perspective Noe's style of direction is something of an eccentric taste, yet at the same time there is still something in Enter The Void that you have to be patient with. A lot like David Lynch's Inland Empire it's easy to forget that you are watching this movie to all of the hallucinogenic images our protagonist sees through his transcendence into the after life, and the life he observes after his own is something almost tough to swallow. Besides the numerous, at times arbitrary disruptive mourning of the one's he once knew, Noe's direction from the perspective of this silent recently deceased protagonist leaves very little to his cast to take care of. And as you would expect of most new actors, they take full advantage of the time they are allotted to throw an authentic fit before Noe's lens. Noe's Enter The Void is a hallucinogenic hypothesis on death, a meditation, an experiment that only certain audiences will understand, recognize and appreciate as a brutally honest attempt at an unyielding aesthetic. Though due to the graphic nature of every depraved act, Enter The Void may still be too much for the even this specific audience Noe is aiming for. I want to say it's something sort of like a Requiem For A Dream, only with the absence of dialogue, the anti-drug campaign and ironically the elements of your usual tragedy. If you can make your way through all of the grit and grime of this hell-ish sort of environment Noe does say something about death that can be taken as something sort of optimistic and for that reason I think Enter The Void is one the most unique looks at death in film today. Enter The Void is just that type of experimental film that you really have to have a stomach for to watch in excess, or at all for that matter.",Enter the Void

I've seen this film twice, once in the theatre and once at home. The effect was so downplayed when I watched it at home that it was evident that this movie must be seen in the theatre. I saw this at a midnight showing in Hollywood, and i'll never forget it.Some movies are more real than life, and this is definitely one of those. There were moments when i was watching this movie and i forgot it was a movie. It was by far the most explicit thing i've ever seen, regarding the violence, sex, drugs, atmosphere. A buddy of mine described it as sitting on train tracks and watching this nightmarish train speeding toward you and there's nothing you can do about it. That's also one of the perks of seeing this movie in the theatre because there's no pause button. Your in it and there's nothing you can do about it. It's by far, anything like you've ever seen before. Dark, beautiful, nauseating, frightening, intriguing, brilliant ,sad, unforgettable. It wasn't until hours after the credits rolled that i realized how technically brilliant this movie was executed. The camera work and editing was flawless, it's amazing that this wasn't considered for an Oscar nomination.Definitely a must see, if only once.

""Noé promised the investors to produce an alternative Version should the final movie be longer than 140 minutes. He solved this problem by simply removing the seventh movie reel. During the removed 17 minutes, nothing essential for the movie's story happens, as he said"". I must have seen the uncut version. It was 160 minutes long. Two hours 40 unbearable minutes. There were a few good ideas and a floating camera, about enough for a half decent movie, but after the first 10 minutes of us floating aimlessly around, it just keeps going on and on and on and on. As the director says, nothing essential happens during the seventh reel. Nothing essential barely happens at all. Seriously, was it not possible to cut the scenes down AT ALL?We see a graphic accident, I don't mind that at all - shocking and very unpleasant - but after the fifth time, sixth, seventh, I have no idea how many times we saw that same thing, the shock, the screaming, over and over again throughout the movie. Then some more floating and spinning camera. A LOT of spinning and floating cameras, floating over the city, diving into some object, blending lights, over and over ... And the accident again. What kind of storytelling is this?I guess there are some pretentious ideas behind all this, but there is no freaking need to keep on going for ever just because the camera floats so beautifully. I was going to rate it 2 or 3 out of 10 just because of the unusual pictures - never mind the plot - but then halfway through I got so insanely bored by this kind of ""storytelling"", it was just painful. A few of the actors were pretty wooden as well.I refuse to rate this higher than 2 out of 10. I don't care what all of you say ...",Enter the Void
108,Pan32,Breakthrough film,9,17 February 2011,"Enter the Void 2009 is Gaspar Noé's psychedelic rendering of the Tibetan Book of the Dead's predictions regarding the death experience, explained in a short lecture by Alex (Cyril Roy) to Oscar(Nathaniel Brown) early in the film.. Oscar is the films protagonist but his face is seen only as a reflection in a mirror or briefly, from above, as his lifeless body lies on the floor of a toilet stall, dead from a gunshot. Thereafter, we see the film from the point of view of Oscar, or rather his spirit, as he relives his past experiences in which case we see the back of Oscar's head as we follow behind, or we flit above the scenes that are ongoing after his death, and follow the travails of his sister, with whom he had lived. Their lives revolved around sex and drugs in Tokyo and Linda {Paz de la Huerta) is clearly at sea without her brother. Of sex there is plenty, but the lighting is always subdued and filtered removing its immediacy and transfiguring it.

109,stuartkpark,A Marmite Film,8,25 September 2012,"Enter The Void is filmed from the POV of a small time drug dealer living in Tokyo. Without spoiling too much, he is setup and shot in a club whilst delivering some 'goods', after his death his spirit floats across the neon cityscape where we still see from his POV. It glides between each of the characters to show how their lives continue and unfold in the aftermath. There are flashbacks of him, his sister and parents which help to give some context to the characters (yes George - characters!) and explains their motivations.The film uses many non-conventional techniques to tell a story and set a scene. It has been likened to the ending of Kubrick's 2001, but more so. If you suffer from epilepsy or motion sickness it may be best to avoid this.The visuals and soundscapes define the film, but there are some very strong themes and subjects tackled, mainly: family and relationships but also life and death.There are no taboos here, no punches pulled, nothing seems to be off-limits which makes for some very powerful and harrowing cinema. If you're aware of the directors previous films then you'll have some idea what to expect.I can't actually decide if I liked it or not, a definite Marmite film. My main criticism is it's far too long, but on the positive side it's great to see a director pushing the boundaries of what's possible with film.

110,OdinsRagnarok,Technically and conceptually interesting... but extremely boring.,3,6 January 2020,"While the concept and technical execution of the movie is very good and interesting, it's a shame it's wasted on terrible editing and pacing. This isn't an epic tale with tons of twists and turns that needs a long time to tell it all. It's a fairly simple story, but padded out to the extreme with ""sequences"" between each scene.I get it's not meant to be fast paced. But had this movie been cut down to 1h 40min (1 hour slower) it would still feel slow paced due to the simple story being told which doesn't contain too many events.Giving this a 3 star feels too generous, as I would also regard this as one of the worst movies I have ever seen. A movie can't stand on the technical features alone, if the story and experience of watching the movie is utter crap. It was such a pain to sit through. It really could have been so much better with some better editing and pacing of it's story.",Enter the Void
111,thismango,Garish metaphysical pornography,5,10 November 2012,"I'm rating this film 5 out of 10 because it's half 10 and half 0. It's mind-blowing, highly original, preposterous nonsense. It's certainly the most depressing film I've seen by a long way. If you remember the way Requiem for a Dream leaves you feeling filthy and sick and multiply that by a factor of 100, and bear in mind that we're dealing with the reality-warping effects of psychedelics, you may be close to imagining the effect of Enter the Void on your typical open-minded hominid.The acting is extremely odd. For the first few minutes I thought I was watching some amateur or student effort. The level of abstraction is fairly high and the characterisation is minimal. If he was trying to recreate the effect of some bunch of jokers filming themselves taking drugs and posting the results on YouTube, he hasn't done badly.The film feels like it's been made by a grizzled crew of mischievous tripped-out cynics who are determined to screw up your brain even if you don't take drugs by creating some kind of irreversible philosophical virus. At times I felt like I was seeing things that should not be seen - and I don't mean the graphic sex scenes - a kind of metaphysical pornography, like catching God having a sly ham-shank.The sheer quantity of semi-abstract cityscapes as the main character's disembodied mind floats around Tokyo was a great risk to take, but the director has certainly had considerable success in building the abstract philosophical structure through the imagery so that the cumulative effect is actually quite stunning, even for a resolutely non-arty film person like me. The entire cityscape becomes a senseless, nightmarish abstraction. There are mind-blowingly brilliant moments in this film of a kind which I have never experienced before. At those times I thought it was one of the most powerful pieces of cinema I've ever seen. It's taking on themes which have been attempted before but never with such thoroughness.There are two major factors that let down Enter the Void. The first is the half-baked references to Buddhism. The director does appear to have a certain degree of understanding of Karma, as is clear from the sense of escalating spiritual tension, like a static charge building up. This is a reasonably accurate depiction of Karma. However, he has no understanding of Nirvana. Enter the Void depicts Samsara without Nirvana. This could be called nihilism. It is depressive, and it is not a correct understanding of Buddhism. A more serious misunderstanding comes from the use of the phrase 'the' Void. There isn't any 'the' Void. Voidness is simply the innate quality of existence. There isn't anything to enter or not enter. He has mistaken Buddhism for a metaphysical theory. This is quite typical of those who think drugs are a shortcut to spiritual experience.This error leads to the second major flaw in the film, which is the ending. It is disappointing, pat and simplistic. After sitting through so many excruciating hours of gruelling hallucinatory grimness, I was still feeling excited by the film's achievements, but when the ending arrived I suddenly thought, ""that was a total pile of crap - what a tosser. Get some sleep, son."" Looking back on it, it's somewhere in between.",Enter the Void

113,prohibited-name-2256,"Visually challenging, yet disappointing",5,10 March 2011,"Only few movies in the history of cinema were able to provide surreal, spiritual and complex themes without falling short somewhere during the delivery. ""Enter the Void"" is no exception to this rule.First few minutes are astounding, with DMT trip painted with so much imagination! Computer graphics guys here really showed what they can do. Sadly, after this short episode they got lazy. After that, spectator truly enters the void, both graphical and on basis of merit.The story, in summary, is about a 20-something American male, living in Tokyo, who experiences an accident, after which his supposed consciousness travels through both near future following that accident, and his very troubled past. There's mention about ""Tibetan Book of the Dead"" (a very old book with instructions on how to deal with oneself after death and before supposed reincarnation). After that mention, the movie tries to bring that description into reality. However, it makes an awful attempt at that, and only delivers gibberish.The book in itself could be a masterful script for a movie like this, but it's so simplified and profane (just like any reincarnation supporter's beliefs)... I can also hardly imagine many people who have read the book to be able to watch the full movie.""Enter the Void"" shoots at deep metaphysical experience, but instead focuses on pain, emotionally devastating stories, and lots of pointless sex scenes. Not that I have anything against sex scenes, but if I want to see it, I'll watch some porn movie, where girls are my type, and the camera isn't flying around bed like a drunken butterfly with no clue as to what to do next, and the accompanying ever-present blur.Visuals are very simple and usually give viewer more of a discomfort, than satisfying experience. Not that it wasn't the point, but they're done without any imagination, or artistic touch. Everything switches endlessly from one scene to another all the time, almost like an ordinary movie really, just with different shots and ""travel sequences"". Hence again: not much imagination used.The end is absurd, trivial, and absolutely predictable. It's sad because the potential is there, story is very solid in a few moments, delivery can be mind-blowing, but as a whole ""Enter the Void"" has just too many gaps to ignore, and the final ""solution"" is like a bad joke.",Enter the Void

115,awmurshedkar,Enter The Void,9,11 June 2012,"ENTER THE VOID – 9.0/10 Director: Gaspar Noé Writer: Gaspar Noé, Lucile Hadzihalilovic (assisted) At least once in a lifetime, an individual comes across an event or entity that leaves them simply bewildered. I believe Gaspar Noe's Enter the Void was my first such experience. This essay is not a review of the film. It is purely an attempt to reflect upon what has transpired. This is not the regular or for that matter even the art-house, alternate film. It is probably beyond those genres as well and does not fall within the realm of common filmmaking conventions.The film is a sensory orgasm of strobe lights, psychedelics, nauseating yet mesmerizing camera work, depressing debauchery and all human behavior that reminds one of an abysmal darkness. While all other things barred, the film is a technical masterpiece and every shot in the film is worth its prolonged torment. The visual experience itself is enough to carry one through the significant run-time of 161 minutes. It cannot be stressed enough how Enter the Void is probably the only film of its kind and not because of its technical prowess, but likely because of the union of all things psychedelic: from the story, to cinematography, the edit, set designs, to character behavior and appearances, to conversations and even the actual location – Tokyo. Together, the film is one experimental, indulgent, dark trip into the void.One reason the film is fascinating is because it challenges all notions and conventions of filmmaking and refutes the purpose of art as a whole. This is surely not Noe's intention, just an inevitable result of such madness. The absolute profanity and the sheer ghastly depiction with which Noe paints life will basically prod one towards questions of metaphysics and ontology. With nihilism at the soul of his ode to man, the obvious oxymoron is the subject matter of reincarnation the film deals with, or at least the concept of it. One one side, his denouement speaks of hope and on the other, his condemnation of this very hope through the hellish depiction of a grim reality.If one could indulge in a little physiognomy, it may not seem so strange that Enter the Void is actually a French film, though Noe is Argentinian. A fascinating possibility proposes that visceral expressions are found in abundance where societal and traditional shackles are least prevalent. Does this explain consummate depictions of human behavior without defilement in Iranian cinema? While it does not explain poor quality filmmaking in India, does it partially address the clandestine voyeur artist in a traditional society and the pelvic thrusts among other innuendos of carnal catharsis? Films are naked depictions of societies; art is. And what conclusion can one draw of the French society since transgressive art has been a birthmark of this land? Only an intriguing side effect of this film.Enter the Void is certainly not a film you can watch as regular viewing. It demands a mind-set, a setting, a form of conditioning, certain values and to a great degree, acceptance. It might prompt unlearning, which is often far more complicated than learning. While there is a good chance one might never want to see his film again – and like every other negative employed, this too is not pejorative – one might also never forget the imagery they are subjected to. This, I believe is the paradoxical nature of Noe's filmography and is what makes it markedly distinctive. I will end by calling what I hitherto called a film, an experience. Whether pleasant or not, you will have to decide for yourself.",Enter the Void
116,lefkiosvanrooy,Perhaps one of the most mind-blowing films in terms of visuals and creating an acid-trip like aesthetic,7,28 March 2016,"Enter the void is perhaps one of the most mind-blowing films in terms of visuals and creating an acid-trip like aesthetic that allows the audience to get into Oscar's frame of sight and see what he sees, which while often visually stunning can often be haunting and really morbid and dark. The director chooses to tell his story through the soul of this young protagonist who dies early on in the movie, a soul that has evacuated its body but lingers in the empty spaces of its universe, unwilling to follow the light and enter the unknown dimension that comes after death. The whole plot of the movie is explained by one of the characters Alex who summarizes the plot of the book he gives to Oscar about the theory of what happens to a person's soul when they die. And in fact this is what happens we are first taken through the most distinct memories of the character from his life from the moment he was born to the moment he dies, which is important as a backdrop to the story to be able to understand where the characters are coming from and why they are the way they are. We get to see the tragedy that struck these 2 siblings when they were little, the incredibly strong and sometimes complicated relationship between brother and sister, the blood bond they made when young to never leave each other even after death which explains why Oscar's soul refuses to leave this world and continues to linger there, despite being unable to help the people in his life and to only be able to observe their circumstances that get worse and worse from the moment he dies. Throughout the movie we are experiencing in both a detached and highly intimate way the drug-fuelled, alienated lives of these people in the neon-heavy city of Tokyo. Detached because most of the scenes are seen from a plain above, with Oscar's soul jumping from room to room crossing buildings roads and spaces, restless and for the most part purposeless. But also highly intimate as seen in times when not only is he observing the actions of these people but gets inside their head and is experiencing in a way what they're experiencing. After an often nightmarish and heavily haunting trip into the city of Tokyo, the audience finds some relief in our character's soul finally settling in Linda's baby with their friend Alex, after searching through possible reincarnation routes of couples having sex in the LOVE hotel (the existence of which hotel isn't necessarily real and could just be symbolic of the act of love in all its various forms conducted by the characters in the film. The love making scene between Linda and Alex is seen as almost a magical experience, and when Oscar's soul gets a glimpse of what his life could be within that family he decides to reincarnate in that way and is transported through the bodies of his soon to be parents to the level of sperm-ovum fusion. The movie finishes its void-like run with the most intense and lively of moments – the birth and first moments of this baby into the world.",Enter the Void
117,robocopssadside-1,Enter the Void (2009),10,28 January 2011,"Quite a departure from ""Irreversible"", Gasper Noe's ""Enter the Void"" is a complete visual triumph. The story centers around two siblings, Oscar and Linda, which suffered from a traumatic accident when they were children. After this misfortune, they make a pact to never grow apart. Many years later they take up residency in Tokyo; Oscar has became a drug dealer, Linda, a stripper. On one fateful night during a drug deal, Oscar is shot and killed while barricaded in a club bathroom. However, his spirit sticks around, following his friends, enemies and sister through the neon-lit streets and grittiest of alleys and buildings in Tokyo.""Enter the Void"" may be the most visually earth shattering film I have ever seen; and if it is not, it's definitely unlike anything else. It jumps from POV to third person like no other film before it. During the entire 2 ½ + hour runtime, you ARE Oscar. You ARE what he becomes in the afterlife, and for me there wasn't a single dull moment. The subplot is awesome; which involves a Tibetan book about out of body experiences, and it ties in perfectly with everything else going on in the main story.This sadly will not be for everybody, though it is definitely understandable. For many, it will be entirely too long; and for others, the enormously graphic sexual content and hallucinogenic drug use will be ultimately offensive. It truly pushes the envelope of extreme cinema, and I applaud Gasper Noe for his fantastical efforts.",Enter the Void
118,mrtomclift,Enter the Void is a cinematic achievement. It's just not one you should bother watching,4,13 January 2011,"It is very rare that you get the opportunity to see a film unlike any film you have ever seen before. Movies, no matter how good, will almost inevitably follow the same pattern, or feature the same stylistic choices, of at least a dozen movies that came before it; only in the rarest cases do we witness something that is either narratively or technically unique. Enter the Void is one of those rare cases. Shot entirely from the perspective of its main character, the film, with its ethereal floating camera-work and its constantly flashing neon glow, is a hallucinogenic tableau meant to depict both a psychedelic drug-trip and the unknowable journey of death and the afterlife. In this regard, French director Gaspar Noé has created a film that is unprecedented, at least as far as I can tell. Yet despite its mechanical distinctions, as a narrative the film is meandering and seemingly meaningless, and offers no real insight or commentary on the experiences it attempts to recreate.Despite coming to the conclusion that I did not like this film, I am honestly not yet sure if this review is going to be positive or negative. On the one hand, the technical aspects of the film, at least before their novelty wears out, are fascinating; on the other hand, when they do, what remains is a largely unexciting drama about absolutely nothing. The plot, in-so-far as there is one, follows a young American drug-dealer named Oskar (Nathaniel Brown) who lives in Tokyo with his go-go dancing sister Linda (Paz de la Huerta). After a botched deal ends with Oskar being shot dead by police in a nightclub bathroom, his spirit leaves his body and floats over the city, observing how his friends and family cope with his death, as well as remembering the events of his life, most primarily the death of his parents and his bizarre relationship with his sister.For the first hour or so, the film is captivating not because of its story but because of the way it is told. Noé's camera-work is audacious; takes go on and on without cutting, as Oskar first walks and then soars over the streets of Tokyo, elaborate crane and helicopter shots blending with creative visual effects. But as the film continues, the constant spinning of the camera begins to irritate; likewise, the first-person perspective (not Cloverfield style, but literally set behind the protagonists eyes, complete with ""blinking"") soon seems like little more than a gimmick. Lastly, the increasing regularity of the 2001: A Space Odyssey inspired tunnel of light sequences border dangerously on pretentious.The film is also seriously lacking in anything resembling profundity. While obviously it deals explicitly with life and death, it seems more concerned with a depiction of the afterlife rather than any real explanation of what it all means. The characters just happen to discuss the Tibetan Book of the Dead mere moments before Oskar is killed, offering some very convenient context as to what is happening in the two and a half hours of movie that follow. Yet there is never any reason given as to why it happens. The films emotional core is also absent because of de la Heurta's feeble performance as the bereaving Linda; while I suppose she should be commended for tackling a difficult role that involves her in several highly compromising positions, as an actress she is just plain unconvincing.Noé previous film Irréversible contained one of the most graphic and disturbing rape sequences ever put to celluloid: this is a director who likes to try and unsettle his audience, and Enter the Void is no exception. Aside from the copious levels of drug related content, the film features several scenes so sexually graphic that one seriously wonders how the actors managed to simulate them. Yet despite the pornographic depiction of sex, the ghostlike quality of the cinematography leaves one feeling detached from the action, and the only time I was actually viscerally affected by Void was during the portrayal of a medical procedure, one so unpleasant that no amount of distance could leave you feeling unperturbed. The rest of the time, the offensive content is at its best undistracing, and at its worst so silly that it reminds one of an infamous shot from the beginning of Antichrist, itself another piece of willfully controversial cinema from a misguided European provocateur.And beyond the creative camera-work, dazzling lighting and multiple attempts to stir controversy, Enter the Void is as empty as its name suggests. Thematically, narratively and at a certain point technically, the film is a failure. Yet I still cannot bring myself to condemn it entirely. Even now, the phenomenal opening credit sequence (the best part of the film in point of fact) continues to flash in front of my eyes, reminding me of the boundaries the Noé attempts to break, pushing the medium into places it has never been before.

In relative terms, ENTER THE VOID is remarkably restrained. There's constant drug huffing, (unfulfilled) incestuous desire, unsettling childs' screams following a violent car crash and relentless sexual encounters including an excessively creative money shot, but the film is first and foremost a lovingly-crafted visual spectacle.The neon landscapes of Tokyo are a pleasure to behold, as are the exhilarating opening credits. For the first half an hour dialogue is languidly droll, and lead character Oscar's ongoing muttered monologue quite brilliantly conveys the struggle to reason and argue with oneself whilst the worse for wear. Oscar's untimely death follows, but the narrative continues to be focused through his hallucinatory and solipsistic visions. The story jumps from early childhood to kaleidoscopic 3D images to the film's other players in varying degrees of ecstasy and strife. Long intervals of white light or pitch black convey the uneasy limbo that Oscar, the other characters and the audience have entered. The sum of all these parts makes for a disjointed yet distinctive experience.

122,Taylor_Gillen,Transcending Traditional Cinema,7,2 January 2016,"I don't know what to think of ""Enter the Void"", and I believe that I will still have no definitive opinion in the future. I would classify this film as experimental, but it's really one-of-a-kind. Why do I rate it 7/10 instead of 5/10? Because I believe it's a necessary film. Some movies are entertaining, some are beautiful, and some of them are necessary.Here's the plot: a young man in Tokyo indulges in the world of drugs. He is set up and, in the aftermath of an altercation with the police, is dead (all in the beginning of the movie). The camera takes on the perspective of his soul as he travels to various locations in Tokyo, watches his friends and loved ones deal with the situation, and visit his childhood. What does he seek? It's hard to say, but maybe resurrection.This movie flows at a snail's pace, but that is intentional. The movie is two and a half hours long, most of the characters slur their dialogue because they are under the influence, and the camera movements are slow, methodical and are not rushed. Like an actual hallucinatory experience, minutes feel like hours, and hours feel like days.Unfortunately, that can become frustrating. This movie works if you watch it in two sessions, but trying to get through it all without a break is difficult.Despite this, I believe this movie is necessary. Cinema is an interesting mix of business and art, and you get movies on both sides of the spectrum. While some experimental films are considered preachy, this movie seems to have no big message. It is simply an out-of-body experience told through a film camera. There are some impressive visuals and strange incidents, but I think that this movie helps reinforce the fact that cinema really generate new ways of telling stories.

123,electrablind,An Experimental Neon Nightmare,5,9 February 2011,"thefilmsmith.com Enter the Void's director Gaspar Noé is most famous for his previous film, Irreversible. Its notoriety isn't due to a compelling narrative, but rather the brutal 10-minute long rape scene. With Enter the Void, Noé is hellbent on retaining his infamy in a 161 minute long* trek through time and Tokyo.The main character Oscar is a white guy (the film doesn't detail his nationality) living in Tokyo, who finds himself dealing drugs to re-unite with his sister Linda. When a deal goes sour, Oscar finds himself in a strange place.I've kept my synopsis brief in order to leave some narrative surprises, but the real point of discussion for Enter the Void is the way the story is told. The film shifts through three points-of-view: either an extreme first person POV in which we are literally behind Oscar's blinking eyelids as he speaks with Linda or his long-haired friend Alex; third person POV in which we are anchored behind an outline of Oscar's head as he experiences various memories; or aerial POVs, in which we zip around Tokyo, through walls and buildings to witness different scenes.The shots never depart from these three templates, and even more audacious is the film's lack of a single cut. Sure, there is enough computer generated wizardry going on to allow ends to each shot; Russian Ark it ain't. But the transitions between scenes and the CGI that link them create the effect of one long take from beginning to finish.Which is one of the many formalistic ways that the film crafts a D-Day assault on the senses. The one take, the bright strobe-light interludes between scenes (used masterfully for the opening credits), the darkness of Tokyo in the middle of the night as we witness the depressing ways in which people react to the film's tragedy. It's like a perverted version of It's a Wonderful Life, in which you see the carelessness of your actions come to bloom. The sordid lives of the Tokyo denizens, both lit and hidden by the neon lights, create a numbing sadness for humanity. If Terrence Malick's upcoming film Tree of Life is being touted as a ""Love letter to God,"" Enter the Void is surely a love letter from the Devil to humanity – it's obvious he's having a ball with us.Neither Darren Aronofsky nor Gaspar Noé is known for subtlety. The blatant Freudian imagery from Black Swan, or the aforementioned rape scene in Irreversible, show that these guys don't play coy. To Aronofsky's credit though, there is always a thematic payoff to his disturbing displays. Filled with redemption, hope, or sometimes even despair, Aronofsky's endings justify the painful journey.That's not the case with Noé's work in Enter the Void. It isn't that I am against sex or violence in cinema – I'm against ridiculous amounts of either that don't serve the film's purpose. At the screening I attended of Enter the Void I could hear an audible groan as the audience anticipated the second foray into the extreme first-person POV of a man having sex with a woman. The first time, you're trying to do something different. A second time, you're making the audience feel a little weird. But a shot in which we see a CGI penis from inside the vagina? The audience bursts into laughter at the film's gratuitousness. Not to mention the number of times we witness a horrendous car accident, which by the third time now features a screaming child and disfigured bodies. It's not enough for Noé to show you something, he has to rub your nose in it. Either he loves such excesses or he enjoys the discomfort he's eliciting from his audience; masochist or sadist. Even with motivational assessments suspended, Noe's style undermines his narrative goals.Ultimately the film appears to state that there is nothing truly sublime in this world (save for our moment as infants breastfeeding) and the best we can do is consume the artificial sweeteners of modern living (drugs and sex) to satiate our desires for Valhalla.From what I've stated, it's evident that this isn't a film for casual film fans. Yes, its formalist feats are quite an experience. Now that the mental and physical novocaine numbness I had after watching the film has worn off, I'm glad I've seen it; I may never see another film like Enter the Void in my lifetime. Seeing it projected on 35mm in a dark room with a booming sound system was an experience of sensory overload that cannot be replicated at home . Even the way in which the film comes back around to the opening discussion of the Tibetan Book of the Dead shows evidence of foresight and an intriguing assessment of life and death (Russ Fischer on the /Filmcast called it a ""movie about heaven for atheists."").However, trying heroin is also probably ""an experience""–but not something you'd recommend.

That would be accurate. Enter the Void appeals to the pleasures, dis-pleasures and vices of the body and mind. He's giving you a sweet and sensuous back rub, and then right before the happy ending he takes out a utility stapler and plunges some heavy-duty staples into the back of your neck. He wants you to FEEL! Not to think. And there are few film makers who are accomplishing that today. Most film makers in the transgressive market are too concerned with the cerebral, the exploitative and the stress caused by the content.The story revolves around the life and adventures of two young Americans, both brother and sister, who are living on the fringe of Tokyo society. Oscar,(played by Nathaniel Brown, who I would say is a bit stone-faced in the role but since most of the film is either his POV or over his shoulder, I will resort to ""stone-necked."") is a drug dealer and Linda (played by the radiant Paz De La Huerta, who on the contrary, overacts quite a bit), is a stripper.

What follows is a transcendental nightmare that blends the past, present and future.Even though it comes off as a Soft-Core ""Lost in Translation"", Enter the Void is an epic to some degree. Not just because of the length, but also because it is a journey. Noe attempts to bring the viewer into the psychotropic experiences of Oscar with a barrage of color and patterns. It's not one of those ""you gotta be high to experience this"" type of films because within the first 20 minutes, you WILL be high. Some films are sobering. This film is intoxicating. And the trip isn't necessarily a good one. Technically though, the film is brilliant. The single-take shot down the flight of stairs that tracks the sleazy French guy rant about Buddhism is notable. Also, the sweeping POV crane shots are absolutely spellbinding. It's Touch of Evil-level ""Wow!"" Getting a low-flying helicopter journey through Tokyo's thriving nightlife is as good as any Rick Steve's tour-video. But he's probably high too, so it makes sense.",Enter the Void

126,radioheadrcm,Relentlessly Nauseating Modern Art,9,4 October 2010,"Enter the Void is exactly the kind of polarizing film that cinema needs right now. Too many films these days play it safe, being concerned with keeping the audience comfortable, safe and happy. Enter Gaspar Noe, who clearly has no regard either for the well-being of either the audience or his actors. We have antagonistically long (but brilliant) takes, beginning in an apartment and ending in a bar, several blocks over. We are given characters and are exposed to their darkest moments, but are never given a real reason to care for them, or to perceive them as anything but wretched. We are also shown some sexually discomforting things that we never really wanted to see on the silver screen (if you've seen it you probably know what I'm talking about). Also, the film is almost completely in first-person viewpoint, so you're constantly feeling confined to what Oscar is looking at, which are mostly psychedelic images. In effect, the feel and tone of the story are immediately off-putting for the viewer, but since you've already bought a ticket, what can you do but follow it through? This is definitely the kind of film that can be approached in the wrong way, both with the medium that you view it through, and with your state of mind. Enter the Void is meant to be a transportive film (i.e. you living directly in the viewpoint of another, and feeling how that person feels, and perhaps even thinking how that person thinks). To technically maximize the experience, the film should really be experienced on the big screen. I'd imagine an IMAX screen to be ideal.I also think a film like Enter the Void really needs to be approached with a separate set of goals than that of a normal film. First of all, chuck any notions of entertainment, or even enjoyment, out the window. While you're at it, remove any notions of positivity that you can think of. The only reactions that Enter the Void will draw from you are negative ones. Personally, the only emotion I consistently felt was a slight nausea, tinted with the occasional horror, or perhaps a shameful arousal, as there is excessive sexual content that is all wretched in one way or another.The film is shot with a certain frame of mind, and sticks to it with remarkable faith. It's in the point of view of a small group of friends who are confined to the drug and clubbing scenes in Tokyo. He then films them in the most abrasive ways possible, showering the viewer in infinite neon lights, and fish-eyed close-ups, and then Noe lets his frames linger on these unsightly images for uncomfortably long. Even with his tracking shots moving from one location to another, when the viewer is normally given a moments rest, he rapidly cuts across hallways, stairs, and streets, and never gives the viewer a free moment to settle down.Despite the film's antagonistic feel, and despite the physical and psychological discomforts that the film drew from me, I still found Enter the Void to be a worthwhile and even inspirational experience. More to the point, Enter the Void may not be a friendly experience, but this exact kind of experimentation and determined expression are just what cinema needs in order to be taken seriously as an artistic medium, when so many other directors air on the side of caution and safety. It might be a difficult ride, but just watch it once and you'll carry it with you forever.",Enter the Void

It's not a ""new thing"" or a ""movie that defies rules"", none of that. It IS a basically European/Canadian ""film"", and being Portuguese I know what I'm talking about. Pretentious little thing, filled with strawb lights, unbelievable soundtrack (in a bad way), hand-cameras that per si make you dizzy. Colours and flashes all the time that can make one as well squirm. Visually, it IS A MESS, don't give me ""impressive"", for there are more colors per frame than frames at times. Soundwise, like I said, it's a mess. Two Things to consider before watching this ""thing"": 1- Be sure you don't suffer from Epilepsy (for real, and it should come with a warning, like some games do; it may really be dangerous, you will see why if you go and watch) 2- Rent whatever movie that sits on right or left of this one...

It is filmed from a first-person perspective. Somehow, it really hit me hard. I felt carried away by this movie, which doesn't happen often. The main character's depth comes from seeing his back story rather than being told about it. The story mixes his past, present, and future into an emotional collage. There were numerous points in the movie where I thought it was about to end as though there was no way the story could continue. You see a lot of turmoil in the characters' lives, most of it really disturbing. The ending of the movie left a smile on my face. I will be watching this one again. The sound effects, visuals, characters, and locations were perfect for this movie. It's a masterpiece.",Enter the Void
129,GregForstner,A movie created at the intersection of life and death,8,7 October 2016,"It's a Noé so one viewer expectation will certainly be fulfilled: this is anything but conventional. It's a 2,5-hour-roller-coaster ride that floods the viewer with hypnotizing pictures, mind-boggling sceneries, mesmerizing colors. Be prepared for a camera panning and swerving as wildly and turbulently as you will have rarely experienced in any other movie. Be prepared for a narrative perspective that is unique in that the main protagonist is killed off the stage after about 25 minutes. Be prepared for a story that virtually dissolves itself into myriads of fragments. Be prepared for an organic study of life and death, love and hate, the power of the libido that is both profound as it is elusive. ""Enter the Void"" is an art movie, even more so than Noé's previous masterpiece ""Irreversible"" in which the story is told backwards: ""Irreversible"" showed the fragility of life with savage ferocity: one false decision (taking that underpass) can lead to a moment that destroys several lives. The peaceful bliss of two lovers is shattered when the woman is violently raped and mistreated, an atrocious act of inhumanity that sparks an unbelievably brutal revenge. Some of the topics of ""Irreversible"" are picked up in this movie and dealt with in a more philosophical, subliminal way. ""Enter the Void"" does not revert to the savage violence that shocked audiences in Noé's previous film but this one is yet another movie that dares to go to places where few other directors would go.The plot with major spoilers ahead: a youthful American called Oscar lives with his sister Linda in Tokyo. He makes his living as a drug dealer and he himself likes drugs quite a lot. His sister spends her evenings in night clubs where she is stripping. One night, Oscar is betrayed by a friend and the police are after him. He is fatally shot but his soul won't leave this world, because he has promised his sister to never leave her..This basically is it: the audience has to digest the (anti-)hero's demise after 25 minutes. This is an unprecedented move: the main protagonist is condemned to the same passivity as the viewers. He is cut off from the realm of acting and interacting and changing the direction of fate – as bodiless soul he is hovering above the actions and his attempts at reincarnation are misguided: even as he returns to his body, his former friends and relatives won't accept he is alive because they know that he died. Just as in ""Irreversible"" the direction of fate cannot be changed, the past cannot be undone.The narrative concept of ""Enter the Void"" is also stunning in its abolition of chronology: when Oscar dies, the narrative dissolves: there is no past and present and future. The spectators are plunged into Oscar's consciousness in which present events trigger memories from the past that he subsequently lives through again. Thus, the viewer learns what defines the special relationship between himself and his sister: when they were still young children, they lost their parents in a terrible car accident. Afterwards he promised his sister that he would never leave her. Countless images of the eternal love for his sister occupy his mind, intercut with quite different manifestations of love that accumulate in the final visit of the ""House of Love"" in the last chapter of the movie. Like all of Noé's movies, this one is highly existential: it is a movie created at the intersection of life and death, the intersection of love and hate, the intersection of unremitting sexual desire and shrill jealousy. It probes into the very questions that define human existence: What constitutes human life? Why are we here and what are we supposed to do? Can we change as individuals and what does death change? Are we independent actors of our faith or are we not rather governed by forces that we cannot begin to understand? While ""Irreversible"" gave rather concrete answers, ""Enter the Void"" is elusive, highly allusive and effervescent. It takes its time exploring the most challenging subjects without providing clear answers. Every viewer has to arrive at their own answers while experiencing and afterwards reflecting this piece of art. Yes, it is a veritable statement of art that Noé has submitted with this one. This is NOT a movie for viewers who want to consume films to pass the time and entertain themselves. With its seemingly endless roller-coaster rides through colors, patterns and its exhibitionistic display of sexuality, this is a film for cineastes and those who are seeking a broader understanding of the forces that steer human life.",Enter the Void

Another movie about sex & drugs,7,23 February 2017,"I'm giving it a 7 only because I'm crazy for the editing, music, and message.The movie itself got very repetitive with 15 minutes dedicated at the end to watching people have sex, and that's it.Besides that, the majority of the time you're just hearing the main character's sister whine and cry, that's it. Granted, she has a terrible life and plenty of reason to cry but the run of the movie has this tendency to show you the same scenes multiple times. If we were saved from watching rerun sex-scenes and their parents die (4+ times) the movie would be about 1/3 of its actual run time.*spoiler* He likes to watch his sister have A LOT of sex (when she's not crying, she's banging), I wouldn't be spending my afterlife like that but that's just me.",Enter the Void

Portraying death, abortion, jealousy, anguish, sex, mommy issues, in ugly but honest ways, the film challenges you to accept the horrific moments that are equally a part of the human experience. This movie gave me nightmares, namely the sequences of his dead parents, and the flashbacks to his childhood, but it felt important that I wrestle with those feelings despite the discomfort. This very unique ride is made even better by incredible editing, cinematography, art direction - the ""Tokyo On Acid"" idea makes for some beautiful scenes, and the portrayal of the feeling of being on various drugs is also realistic.

The minimal background music, that does not super impose itself on the moment, it lets scenes talk for themselves is beautiful..It goes without saying, that the cinematography, which uses psychedelic lights and supportive drone like sounds, leaves the mind feeling tippy. I'm always looking for films like this where music and cinematic expression do the talking instead of extensive dialogue..Enter the Void is a beautiful example of this possibility..The plot of the film is simple. It unfolds over one night where a drug deal goes real bad and is interlaced with scenes from the protagonists' past which relates to current relationships and events..Seeing the world through the protagonists view from when he is tippy to when he is coy and asking strippers ""Hey, You want to try these? Take just one"", or when he floating through the city of Tokyo has a certain je ne sais quoi..I love that they filmed this in Tokyo, Tokyo from the sky and Tokyo from the street with club houses/ stripper bars are different experiences.. There is one scene that remained ingrained, Oscar is at Alex's house and his roommate has this model of Tokyo with neon lights, its quite precious..This movie certainly worth a watch for its endeavor in setting an artistic highI'm on my way to see more from Gaspar Noe – Irreversible and I Stand Alone are recommended as must watch..",Enter the Void

Our body is just like a cloth that we changes life over life and if you knew this fact then you will sure enjoy this flick.after Irréversible (2002) Gaspar Noé taken so much time to come with this another full length feature film. what is special about him is that he is an artist and a great director, he combined all his creative elements together to form a masterpiece. may be he also knows the fact that not many people can relate (understand) art forms but movie is sure one thing that connects the world.if you remember the trailer of this movie which gives the impression of another surrealism with all that crazy fluorescent lights playing with you eyes and brain nerves. movie has got the exact same mood but more than that its a relationship story. American brother(Oscar)and sister(Linda) who lives together in Tokyo,Japan, their parents died when they were just kids, Oscar as a kid promise Linda that he will never leave her but growing Oscar lived his life in a very sleazy manner as a drug dealer and gets shot by police at the club toilet. Oscar always wanted to take care of her sister but as he is dead now his soul worried about her sister. while around her his soul takes a look at his back life and connections with people around him . Its a 2hr and 45 minutes movie told in Oscar POV throughout. movie needs lots a patience and a mind which ask you questions about the things around you. This film is shoot-ed in very free manner, contain some pornography material too but thats the beauty of Gaspers's movie, he tried to give the answers about how and why we are connected or disconnected to our friends, family and people around us.

Also, the fact that you know much of the story right from the beginning doesn't help the boredom of this movie.

143,thejohnscott,Watched this film whilst on LSD.... oh my.,9,1 December 2016,"This film was a most unexpected experience for me. One night after everyone else had gone to bed I sat pondering the meaning of life the universe and everything. Sometimes this can get quite intense, as occasionally I do this on acid. Yes it's an unusual practice for a ""professional"", but still. I decided to watch a film and started digging through my unwatched films, I found Enter the Void. I didn't know I had it, where it came from or anything about it. I just put it on.The intro credits had my eye's watering and holding onto the couch, already it was starting to mess with my mind. I was then fired into a dark world with a 1st person view of this tragic and violent story. The glorious visuals and shocking dark nature the film kept me mesmerised, whilst much of me wanted to scream and run away for large parts of the film.The DMT scene totally messed with me and projected 3D imagery into the room. It was absolutely amazing. It really is like it has been designed for people who are taking hallucinogens. I still had no idea at this stage the horror that was to follow.The plot although sinister and as macabre as can be remains within the bounds of reality. If it was a ""fantasy"" type picture it would have been more easily assimilated when I watched it. But no, everything that happens could indeed happen. It is a true horror picture even though it is using a strange mode to convey the story. Towards the end of the film I had to take breaks and walk away for some minutes. The content is deeply unsettling. It made me feel genuinely uneasy and wishing for it to end, whilst raptly watching every moment of it. This is not a film for the young of heart or those with delicate sensibilities. It is brutal and emotionally disturbing and covers many topics that are rarely seen in film in such an honestly vulgar portrayal.I watched it again some weeks after the first time to try to get some contrast against my state of mind during the first viewing. To be honest it was much better on LSD. I don't know if it was just that I knew what was going to happen the second time I viewed it or that I honestly didn't feel like putting myself through it again.I would definitely recommend this film for buffs and more darkly eccentric people. It has amazing visual effects, a highly unusual format and a little told story that will leave you thinking about it for some days afterwards.",Enter the Void
144,blackledgec,Big Big WoW!!!,10,11 February 2013,"I have come to realise that this film isn't for everyone. People will either love it or hate it. The opening credits are horrible with the whole strobing look going on. However one mustn't be fooled by this as a sign that the film will irritate throughout. Gasper, in my view is nothing short of being a cinematic genius. The concept alone is worthy of labelling him as such.It is unique, a one off. Sure there have been films done in the past of a person's spirit ""letting go"" experience (Ghost & Sixth Sense spring to mind straight away). But this is the first film that I've watched where it feels incredibly real and in some ways coldly realistic. Where ghost tries to pull at the heart strings, enter the void makes you think. It makes you think about the harsh everyday world that we live in. Hollywood is nowhere to be seen in this film. Sure there's a ""it turned out OK in the end"", ending. But the journey to get there was a stark one. I myself prefer this approach. The bird's eye view won't be for everyone and neither will it's semi-non linear story line. Some people will dislike the sex scenes and the rather less pleasant characters. Some will even have a problem with the length of the film. But being a Kubrick fan allows me to relish in this sort of film. It is an early 21st Century masterpiece. As Space Odyssey was a 20th Century masterpiece. Neither film was to be a commercial success, but both are in my blu-ray collection. It would be fair to say I love Enter the Void. I will watch it again and again. Some of the best films ever made can only oddly be described as fascinating. This is one of those films.",Enter the Void
145,The_paranoid_android,1/2 part sex exploitation and 1/2 seizure,2,12 November 2010,"I was thoroughly intrigued by ""Enter the Void"" when I watched the trailer. The idea of seeing a man's life detached from his earthly bonds gave me hope that it would be an introspective view on his life akin to the writing of Charles Dickens. Oh, how horribly wrong I was.Not to write off the director completely, Gaspar Noé, attempts to push the medium of film in terms of style, however, he fails spectacularly on various different levels. The dialogue feels tired and cliché, and the actors have no emotion when giving their lines making one feel like Mr. Noé plucked these individuals off of the set of a commercial for a local hardware store and placed them in front of the camera. Not since ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" have I seen such a blatant attempt to ignore character development or story in favor of psychedelic images. I'm absolutely shocked at how much content in this film appears to be depressing, shocking, or disturbing for the sake of itself rather than serving the story. I was never entrenched in the story thinking, ""What will happen next?"". Instead, I wondered, ""When the Hell will this be over?"" This 'film' has so many places where the movie could end that it could have been the climax that if it ended 45-60 minutes early, no one would be able to tell if anything was missing from the plot. Sex in the film seems to be thrown whenever the director gets bored with his own film and can't think of anything else to do. And when sex can't satiate his interests, Noé decides to focus on more neon-lights to the point of inducing vomit. Camera shots that attempt to be sweeping come out as unnecessarily disorienting and annoying. Also, minus several points for using cheap ""jump-scares"".Unless you want to be depressed or angered about over how incredibly terrible a film can be handled, avoid ""Enter the Void"" at all costs and save your money for a movie that actually tries.",Enter the Void

147,grmagne,Stunning...in many ways,9,15 September 2009,"If the following things disturb you, then you should probably avoid this film: strobe lights, drug use, shaky hand-held cameras, graphic sexuality, sperm, spinning cameras, psychedelic imagery, blood, gay sex, abortion, breastfeeding or a graphic auto wreck.But if you're still intrigued then sit down and get ready for nearly three hours of mind-blowing imagery that you'll never forget! Although IMDb lists the Toronto Film Festival version as ""only"" 135 minutes, according to my watch we got the 163 minute version that was shown at Cannes. The presenter also warned us 3 times before the screening that anyone with epilepsy should leave the theatre due to the flashing lights in the film. She was quite serious about that.I was a bit apprehensive prior to the start of this movie. I didn't ""get"" 2001 at all the first time I watched it and I positively hated David Lynch's ERASERHEAD. Would I enjoy ENTER THE VOID? Understand it? Walk out before the end? Yes, yes and no.The film opens with Oscar and Linda, siblings from the United States living in Japan, looking out at Tokyo from an apartment balcony. It quickly becomes obvious that Oscar is both a drug dealer & addict while his sister works as a stripper. Their tragic family history is revealed in segments throughout the first hour. The entire film is seen from Oscar's perspective, either as: (1) First-person, shaky camera, blurry shots as Oscar walks around Tokyo, very high on drugs (2) An out-of-body experience where Oscar floats around the city observing Linda's life and the people that interact with her (3) Flashbacks to Oscar and Linda's youth, similar to (1) except that here we always see the back of Oscar's head in the shot rather than ""through his eyes"" (4) A surprise at the climax of the film.Number (1) above may sound nausea-inducing to some, but there's usually interesting dialogue to distract you from the disorienting visuals and these scenes only comprise a small percentage of the total screen time. Technique number (2) could have been Oscar-worthy if it was filmed for a less controversial movie. Floating and spinning above the city of Tokyo and watching various dramas unfold from up above is absolutely incredible. You'll spend so much time watching from this perspective that it's easy to get lost in the images and forget what an incredible technical achievement you're observing.Virtually all of the key plot elements occur within the first 90 minutes of the film. After that the film transforms into more of a psychedelic, visual experience while the story fades away. This phase of the film really tested my patience and I started to check my watch frequently but there were enough eye-popping scenes that I'm sure I'll view this a second time someday. The momentum returns during the final 10 or 15 minutes, and although this final phase is simply a logical conclusion of what had been blatantly foreshadowed earlier, it's nonetheless amusing and incredible to watch the taboo-breaking finale.This film is very unique, disorienting and absolutely incredible & unforgettable. I can definitely understand why it's been compared to 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, but I found ENTER THE VOID to be more accessible and more comprehensible during my first viewing. It's too controversial and too bizarre to appeal to most people, but it will undoubtedly find its niche as one of the greatest cult classics of all-time.",Enter the Void
148,kentuckyfriedpanda42,Astounding and infuriating all at the same time!,9,23 August 2010,"Where to start? I saw this film nearly a month ago at Melbourne International Film Festival. I haven't quite been able to shake it from my brain since! Firstly, let's get the negatives out of the was. The film is at least an hour to long and, especially in the latter half, at times ridiculously self-indulgent.However, as a whole, the film has this dreamy, hallucinogenic quality that absolutely entranced me. I admire and respect ""Irreversible"" a great deal; however, the at times raw emotional quality of ""Enter The Void"" struck a greater chord with me as a viewer. I love the scene where Linda finds out Oscar has died. One of the best uses of selective focus I've seen in film in a very long time.This is a film that demands to be seen in a cinema. Noe's command of sound and vision is truly astounding to behold. On both a physical and psychological level, he really gets you into the heads of the characters. Apparently, Noe spent two years planning the camera-work on the film. This sense of attention to detail definitely shows in the finished product. A month after seeing the film, moments and images of it are burnt into my brain.I will be the first to say that ""Enter The Void"" is absolutely an acquired taste and definitely not for everyone. However, if you have the mind and sensibilities for it, I can't recommend it enough. While not as deeply disturbing as ""Irreversible"", it is,in many ways, infinitely more challenging.I have always loved films that can push me, provoke me and take me somewhere I have never been before.

149,not_the_real_george,A superficial approach to something potentially big,6,7 February 2012,"Gaspar Noe's films try to be more of an experience than other movies out there. Indeed, Irreversible is a original masterpiece, but was it just luck ? The first 30 minutes of Enter the Void hooked me. We got the character perspective, which is quite rare(in some films we have the ""camera perspective"", but not the ""protagonist perspective"") and the environment is just so real. The apartment, then the night clubs and streets in Tokyo. No doubt, I would have loved the whole film just going on like that...But then Oscar dies and comes the much expected ""out of the body"" part. Now this isn't about believing in reincarnation or not... The question is : if your mind doesn't exist anymore, just how ""personal"" can those experiences get? Somehow our hero keeps floating over the main events that keep unfolding after his death(this is how the plot goes on), has insights into the past and sees ""Nirvana(?)"". The fact that the blood pact the brothers made at 10 years old counts in the after life is just pure commercial superficiality. Leaving that logic aside now, the way to describe the continuity of the plot is : one thing after another, hardly any emotional content tying it all together, no protagonist and a lot of useless city landscapes and sexuality.The visual aspect is very important in this film. I should mention I loved The Tree of Life where the plot is strong and the visuals kind of make sense. Here I've said a few things about the plot and the visual seems to be just for the sake of it. You just look at it, and you don't feel anything. It's just computer effects, OK some are really good, but how good can they be on their own ?There is a lot to be said about sexuality in this film, but I would narrow it down: it's simply too much. The characters(and the whole world really) seem to be in a constant sexual trance, only living for body pleasures. Nothing out there but clubs, bars and naked woman. Where is the daylight ? Our hero observer seems to be quite discriminating, as if he would have a mind to discriminate with.In the end , there is no real message, but rather a fairytale ending. Nothing bad about those kinds of films, I love watching good fairy tales, but not ones who think they are deep.",Enter the Void
150,jjanerney,"Euphoric, toxic, beautiful, rancid and enchanting",10,2 April 2016,"What can I say about this epic film, Gasper Noe's magnum opus. This is perhaps the most physically exhausting film I have ever seen. A film that you have to prepare yourself to watch, that leaves you feeling empty and drained by it's conclusion. This is typical Noe, just on the grandest, most ambitious scale yet. The intimacy(for lack of a better word) of irreversible or I stand alone is to a degree lost in the grandeur of this film. It is loosely based on the Tibetan book of the dead, as hinted to quite inelegantly near the start of the film. The plot is quite simple, after our protagonist/antagonist is killed we follow his soul through a pov camera and see flashbacks and mainly how his friends and relatives continue with their life after his death. This film is in essence a trip, and a character study. And the characters are fascinating, self destructive, manipulative wrecks that still demand my attention and empathy. As a trip though this film is exceptional. Filled with a typically Noe color scheme, aggressive neon lighting and a camera that goes everywhere along with some of the most disorientating visual intricacies, the film becomes a sensory overload. If there is one thing more important than anything else to Noe, it is excess. This film not only depicts excess but jumps head first into said excesses. A film that runs for almost 3 hours, were the camera flies around the city at breakneck speed and enters peoples bodies, a film that will indulge itself in the debaucherous acts of the characters and then revel in the consequences and dance on their proverbial graves. The metaphysics of the film are strange, with weird Freudian flights of fancy and a very nihilistic view of death, that doesn't deal with what happens after you die but how life on earth continues without ever missing a beat, not a piece of religious cinema or a film denouncing religion, just one that deals with the aftermath of death in an incredibly bleak and unblinking manner. Having said that though, I think the metaphysics are flawed, and the film gets bogged down by its ambition sometimes. However, I don't think that matters, this film is about a visceral experience for the viewer and in that respect it doesn't disappoint.Noe is a filmmaker with no filter, he has produced a film so ambitious and limitless it is almost a miracle it was made at all. So lets be grateful that such a ambitious, masterful piece of cinema has been created and that we can rest assured that auteurs like Noe continue to produce cinema that provoke reactions and thought from audiences willing to give them time.",Enter the Void
151,AMadLane,"Like Requiem for a Dream married up to Fantasia -- Grim, Overlong but Visually Brilliant",9,11 November 2010,"I saw this in the Landmark's Main Art Theater in the Detroit suburb of Royal Oak on Wednesday night, Nov. 10, 2010, late. It runs almost two and a half hours in the version I saw, and felt substantially longer, due to numerous shots that amount to ""false endings,"" or have that feel. The camera work and cinematography are nothing short of brilliant, and -- assuming you can survive the harrowing emotional parts of the film, in order to experience these extraordinary technical elements (and here I would include not only the camera-work, but the acting, directing of the actors, and script) -- should be seen by all brave film students.The camera drifts over a Tokyo that seems shrouded in constant night, ablaze with neon, reminiscent of Blade Runner in its depressing claustrophobia. All the main characters are indiscriminately abusing hallucinogens, stripping, or engaging in other dreary life choices. Through flashbacks, we understand that Oliver and his sister Linda have been orphaned as young children due to a car crash, and, in spite of a childhood pact to always stay together and look after each other, are sent by their overwhelmed grandparents to live in separate foster homes. Oliver eventually ends up in Japan, and soon generates enough drug profits to bring his sister over to be reunited with him.She soon falls in with a Japanese topless nightclub owner, with whom she also then has a sexual relationship. Oliver is killed early on in the film in a raid on a high tech drug den/bar, shot by overzealous police, and from there his spirit soars through a timeless quilt of past and present. Long, long swooping takes (Noe's earlier film Irreversible used this technique in spots as well), interrupted by the camera constantly diving through various objects that become as portals -- this is a filmic tour de force, and if you can get past the barrage of violence, degradation, soulless couplings, depressive set pieces (among them, a graphic abortion, a vivid and gory car crash, a slow death in a dirty bathroom stall, et al.), something like a happy ending does eventually arise out of the murk -- although I doubt you'll think that you've left the theater anything like ""happy"" or ""fulfilled"" by your experience.One to see more than once, if you can hack it.",Enter the Void

The movie offers a perspective on life and death while leaving many things open to interpretation. But no matter how much you think about it, everything that you will see and everything you need to know, is basically nothing more than the IMDb synopsis.

To me, the difference between ""Art"" and ""Crap"" is that one takes skill and mastery of a medium, the other takes a gimmick. Take a wild stab at which one this movie is.Here's the entire plot. Kid is a drug dealer. Kid gets shot. Suddenly, ORGY! Kid's sister gives birth to kid.Over 2 hours and 40 *explicative deleted* minutes. Any time a movie can have two and a half hours removed from it and lose nothing in the translation, IT ISN'T A GOOD MOVIE.inb4 ""Oh the visuals!"" screw you. This self-important ass isn't doing anything that Hertzog didn't do 60 years ago, better.I will give the director/writer this. It's probably a very accurate depiction of what death is like. It's certainly a fairly accurate depiction of what being high is like. The problem comes from this. Death is amazingly dull. I mean dear lord, I was actually watching the clock on this because I wanted it over that badly. Filming someone waiting in line at airport security for 3 hours might be accurate too, but it's not worth watching! Even if you throw neon in there! In fact, that's actually a really excellent analogy. This movie is functionally identical to watching someone in Airport Security at McCarran airport in las Vegas. There are blinky flashy lights, part of you thinks that it may just be cool... and then it GOES ON FOREVER. And then you get to where you're going and an orgy breaks out.Seriously, I laughed out loud at that point. The problem isn't the symbolism, I get all of that. The problem is the complete lack of purpose to it. Our disembodied cameraman of a hero learns nothing, accomplishes nothing, and changes nothing. And again, while that may be what reincarnation would really be like, it's painfully dull to watch.I mean maybe watching it high gives off all sorts of deeper meaning, but you can say the same thing for an audio visualizer. Doesn't mean it warrants nearly 3 hours of screen time. The entire time I kept waiting for something to happen. Anything. But nothing does. At all. And then you think, ""Oh! Wait! What's this? Actual drama? NO! Just more flashy lights! Oh well.""Any movie that ends with me screaming profanity at the screen is probably doing it wrong.

Stuart Miller, for one, as the victim's father, was outstanding (agents must be lining up) . . . .

Yeah, the movie is innovative and has really great visuals. I'm into Gaspars movies, but this seemed more like an excuse to try out a new camera than an important story that needed to be told. The story pretty much ends at 20 minutes, after that, it's downhill. I was upset because I think this guy has potential, but this was a hardcore step backwards. I believe that movies exist to tell important stories. Important in the sense that you learn something. I want to walk out of the cinema a different person. But with this film, I walked out a very tired and unchanged person. I don't believe that cool camera-work and trippy images are an excuse to make a movie. The acting was poor and the character definition inexistent. The plot it minuscule and the message superficial. Best part: initial credits were brilliant. And I think the jury was blind to consider this film for a special mention over Dogtooth, which in my opinion is probably one of the best films of the year.All in all, if you want some cool background images for an after party, this film is perfect, but for those people who need a little substance, stay away (or turn off after the first 20 minutes).",Enter the Void

Without exaggeration, this movie has the greatest cinematography I've ever seen in a movie. He uses a mixture of point of view and out of body experiences so fluidly that you can barely notice where the cuts were. Not only is this movie beautiful to look at, but it's also very tragic and uplifting in ways that words cannot describe. I watched this movie on my own for the first time, and I sat in awe for 3 minutes, jaw hanging open, after it ended. Within the following two weeks I showed it to my brother, two friends, and my dad, who all instantly said it was one of the greatest movies they've ever seen upon conclusion. Gaspar's style has no equal. People who complain it dragged on didn't get that Gaspar set his ideas and stuck to them, he wasn't going to stop doing the sweeping shots or the light shots and throw off the whole continuous feel of the film. The dramatic modern drama story line is also gripping and unforgettable. The main character's calmness is haunting and all the acting in this movie ranges from good to great. The ending will make you think, and after 3 viewing I still don't get it fully, but the doesn't stop this movie from having memorable last impression.Yes the movie is explicit, but the explicitness is easy to work past when you are caught up in the sheer beauty of whats going on on screen. And if that is what prevented this from being nominated for any Oscars, shame on the academy.This is my new favorite movie of all time, and it's one of the few that has had a physical and emotional effect on me.

He did it in Irreversible when Vincent Cassel goes amok with a fire extinguisher and he did it again with Soudain Le Vide. As I am a photographer of profession I have got a somewhat blasé relationship to photography and I am not easily impressed but Soudain Le Vide is something very, very special in fact singular, I have never seen such photography and if you have not seen the film, then neither have you. Though I have a preference for films with a more complex and less dispiriting story line I can none the less not avoid to applaud this truly magnificent masterpiece, it is art in its highest form and unique in its existence the only thing I can think of even vaguely in its style is Prodigy's video for Smack My Bitch Up but the latter is hardly in the same category. Due to the way it is filmed one cannot shake the notion of being present in the room with the characters themselves. The acting is also masterful no lose treads no weak link all characters are believable even down to the extras, which is a rather stunning feat and the ending suits the film perfectly.

Or should I say are you out of your mind people? This movie was utter nonsense with so many aspects that make a good movie.I know some of Gaspar Noé's work. I think I know the way he thinks, and he is kind of a basket case in my opinion. But so am I, and I like mind messing type of movies. What I loved in Irréversible was that it was shocking but yet had a great storyline, production, and atmosphere.I didn't know anything about this movie, did not bother to check the basic plot before watching. While watching the first half with spinning cameras, the camera-work itself reminded me of Irréversible, and then I realized this must be Gaspar Noé. And when I saw the first ""shocking"" imaginary, I knew it for sure.For those who don't know about Noé's mind, this movie is very disturbing, morally questionable, twisted, shocking, provoking, and most of all - very different. I don't recommend watching if you are not mentally prepared, if you are not used to see or don't like to watch annoying flashing lights and neon, nauseating spinning and shaking camera work, drug use, pornography, sperm, psychedelic imaginary and colors, gay sex, abortion, violence, breastfeeding, night club ""business"", blood, suffering of children, detailed face mushing etc.The first half of the movie was awesome though. It was original and brilliant. I liked the POV (subjective point of view) because it was well done and got me actually feel the protagonist and see his eyes what was happening. Although after the protagonist had died, and the camera work transformed more objective way, the movie also died...Especially the end part of the movie was not good. The whole plot is simply too easy, pointless, and frustrating. It is also too provocative, it does not get to me as Irréversible did. There is just too much of THAT, ""you have to show everything"", ""let's make the viewers angry"", ""this has not been done too many times"". Those Gaspar Noé's so called ""power tools"" don't get me this time. Just plain stupid and pointless. Got actually really bored.The movie is way too long. It did not success in its mission to make ""wow"" expressions or some great controversy or feelings for me. It just frustrated the .... out of me. I did not like the last half our pornography, because I did not come to see pornography, I came to see a movie package, hopefully entertaining one! After the movie I felt like ""what the. I just watched?"". Obviously nothing worth recommending for.The movie is nothing but some nonsense fake art which everyone worship as a great artistic work. What? Art should be even more entertaining! This was nowhere near entertaining. Just because it is some kind of art piece of something it does not automatically mean it's great. I mean come on, don't say you were not bored to watch a hour (which felt like 10 hours) of floating around, spinning, night clubs, cities, without any narrative or knowledge what is going to happen and what is the deal here? I got really bored and I don't understand how I managed to sit it through...I give Gaspar the points for that some people this might shock and annoy very much. Points also for the first half of the movie. But the whole thing goes way down the hill. I have to say Enter the Void was interesting change, and for example the last minutes were even funny and cool to watch (the close up from you know what). Now I know what happens when I die...In the other hand here is a movie which makes you feel many ways, but nowhere near like Irréversible. Not very good movie.

By seeing his earlier films I knew what to expect.... a polarising, unusual, disturbing and experimental film, full of graphic violence, sex, rape, bizarre camera-work and flashing lights.The first 20 minutes or so are from Oscar's first person perspective, literally through his eyes. It immediately becomes apparent that he is a drug dealer who consistently experiments with different kinds of drugs (mostly psychedelic drugs such as DMT) while his sister is a stripper in a Japanese nightclub. Early in the film he is shot and killed by police in the toilet at a bar called The Void when they believe he has a gun. In his dying moments his pineal gland naturally releases a large amount of dimethyltryptamine that makes him hallucinate, making him remember his childhood, his experience with drugs and the events leading up to his death. We are then shown the aftermath of his death, again from his point of view. As his soul floats over the city, he watches the people he knew as they continue their lives.This film is ambitious and if you watch it in the right frame of mind it does not disappoint. It's very disturbing, confronting and visually stunning. But it certainly is NOT for everyone. If you aren't prepared for it then you likely won't enjoy it.... a rule that applies to all of Noe's films. And unlike everyone else here I wasn't bothered by the length.... but then again nothing really bothers me much which is probably why I'm capable of liking Gaspar Noe as he keeps scraping the boundaries of what is acceptable in cinema.

He basically was as dumb as they come, with absolutely no self respect or respect for anyone else, even his own Sister who he lets spiral into one bad situation after another.If that wasn't bad enough, just after you start to despise the main character, it seems that the Director then made the rest of the film whilst tripping on ketamine, it became very disjointed, depressing and self indulgent - it almost made that dreadfully depressing film Requiem for a Dream seem quite upbeat and lighthearted.All I learned from this film was what I already know, stay away from Americans and 'negative creep' drug takers as they are invariably trouble.

This brutally honest visualization of life will burn itself into your head. Gaspar Noé has made a movie like no other i have seen before. The closest comparison may be ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", yet incredibly this movie even transcends Kubricks nauseating travel through space and time. ""Enter the Void"" has not a single traditional shot, but slowly floats through life and death of the main protagonist, flashing at you its neon lights and taking you through grimy streets. It is, as the movie proclaims itself, ""the greatest trip of all"", and leaves drug-filled Tokyo as flickering backdrop, while exposing the viewer to every harsh, brutal, sexual, desperate, panicked, euphoric and dirty facet of life. There is no hiding from the imagery presented, no pretending, no being above it. As foreign and shocking as the life shown may be to you, it is entirely human, entirely real. What aspects you will take away from this experience i can not tell you, but there are many moments to ponder, many traumas to relate to. Ultimately, what ties ""Enter the Void"" to movies you have seen before, is the overarching idea of life and death. The human spirit transcending any individual life.

Camera, sound, visual effects: Together they create the vision of being there, being Oscar, the main character, see through his eyes and his mind, and experience his experiences - if you allow it, because it is a challenge. Gaspar Noé requires the viewer to open his own mind, flow through the pictures, accept moments of strange nothingness and be seated for over 2½ hours.The story is about love between a brother and sister, who lost their parents at young age and now (in their 20s) are trying to find a place in life and a new home in a cold world. It is a story about how the War on Drugs ruins lifes for nothing. And it is a story about how dying may be, leaving the body, reflecting all past and entering the circle of life again.""Enter the Void"" is about drugs and night life too. It takes the viewer on a hot roller-coaster ride through ecstasy and passion.

Mind-altering substances, that may be used with caution and expert knowledge.If you would take the red pill, then I highly recommend to enter the void and watch this movie.

Last year, I was in Tokyo for two weeks and loved it to bits, so I understand the attraction of Tokyo for young people. Enter The Void depicts Tokyo not only from a western eye but from an Asian eye too, I cannot explain why but it does. As an artist myself I understand the desolateness one may experience in any foreign culture, in this case, Asian.I assume that most of my colleague-workers as teachers, both in Tokyo or HCMC can relate to this movie well, not only because of the setting of ourselves in such an other culture but - and here I need to be careful - most expats in Asia have mostly 'a reason' to be in Asia. My reason to be here has to do with the death of my brother. And I have found a motive and reason to continue living here because of it.Alienation is part of my life, yet 'connection' too. Let's put it like this, one may be alienated from alienation, which is bad of course and yet again connect with life in another dimension, not always understanding why but yet doing so. A relief. Art is coming to terms with an alienation based in a memory that hasn't died. This movie does that greatly, and I don't think viewers may easily understand the producer of this movie, but this movie - as art usually does and should be doing - transports the viewer to its own familial trauma's and alienations. How we cope with them is the stuff for psychiatrist and yes, you name it, artists. This movie is a work of art. THANK YOU PRODUCER.",Enter the Void

The shots taken from above and the ""flying"" strikes of the room between the buildings leave little room for the interpretative qualities of the protagonists. In fact it gives free rein to the exasperation of hallucinatory and hallucinating reality, in a Tokyo noir and illuminated by the neon, which definitely marries the film's anxious and tormented purpose. In the final and at certain points of the vision, the strongly ""filterless"" nature of the story, associated with a massive use of post-production (sometimes even approximate) with the addition of distortions of the visual spectrum in wide angles or long fields, could make turn up your nose at the most canonized.

186,groudoka,ENTER THE VOID REVIEW,10,24 September 2020,"I've seen Enter the Void so many times, and yet the standout moment from the entire experience remains the same. For most, it's the opening credits. Considering it's my favorite opening credits sequence of all time, it's not hard to see why; it's well-known to the point where it has its rip-offs. However, while the opening credits sequence is a flashy yet intense taste of what's to come, it's never been the standout. Nor is it the ending that leaves plenty of room for existential discussion, nor is it Oscar's harrowing death scene that acts the epitome of ""too real."" The flashbacks are a contender, especially with the roller coaster sequence being the best jumpscare in cinema history; however, it's none of these. It's the neon city near the end.The experience of the neon city as the camera slowly reenters the Love Hotel is the peak of this film as an audio-visual experience. If anything, the neon city is the only bright spot in this crushingly bleak experience; it feels utopian, yet the droning soundscape is as sorrowful as ever. The cinematography blending with practical effects and CGI remains a sight to behold, and it's all in service of creating an experience that alters consciousness. Although I've never done psychedelics (and never will, it's something I can't handle), Enter the Void is the closest experience I have to a film that warps my perception of reality until it's over. It's an experience that makes me feel like I have died along with Oscar; from there, it's a spiral into one of the most haunting, existentially terrifying depictions of life and death I've ever experienced.The last time I walked into Gaspar Noé's void up until now was me bridging the gap, watching it on my phone strapped in a Google Cardboard headset and earbuds. As immersive (and deeply unnerving) as the experience might've been, this watch had the most severe impact on my emotions and overall psyché than any other. I don't have a concrete explanation as to why; maybe it's due to how oppressive this year has been. Perhaps it's due to depressive episodes overwhelming me over the past few months, making the days blend in a sea of wasted time. Maybe this film altering my perception and making me feel like the void of death consumed me has finally gotten to me. In all honestly, it's hard to say whether this rewatch of Enter the Void was helpful for me in any sense of the word.However, Enter the Void is still a beautiful film that encapsulates everything I want art to be. It's a perception-changing experience that shakes me to my core. Every watch is overwhelming. Putting the reflections of the beauty, the glooms, and the fragility of life itself this film gives me to paper has always been impossible. Gaspar Noé provides one of the most vulnerable portrayals of the human experience I've ever seen, and by now, Enter the Void has rooted itself in a deeply personal place. It remains in my all-time favorites, and yet it's not one I can repeatedly rewatch for the sake of my sanity. It's a draining, depressing watch that doesn't have any of the thrills of Climax or even a narrative structure to focus on like Irreversible. Thomas Bangalter doesn't provide a usual soundtrack, only an ambient nightmare. All of Gaspar Noé's idiosyncrasies remain outside of that, and this is the film that needed them the most. Without his trademarks, this film wouldn't be the experience it is.Even so, with every scene having these overwhelming technical qualities and holding relevance in its emotion and themes, why the neon city? What about that minute-long sequence gets me every time? It's not the only bright spot in the film, especially with the splashes of happiness between Oscar and his sister. Maybe it's merely because of how gorgeous it all is, or it's the camera movement. However, what I think makes it representative of the whole experience is how it's transportation to a new world. All art operates on this motif; it's a new world to temporarily abandon ours. Enter the Void, as depressing as it is, doesn't differ from that. It provides me with an entirely new mindset with each watch, even if it's one as crushing as this. Although it's an experience that leaves me feeling dead and empty through most of it, scenes like the neon city serve as a reminder that I'm still alive and am grateful for it. Some days, that's all I need.",Enter the Void

190,iain-cocks,Brilliant in parts but tedious to get through,6,15 August 2013,"The opening credits and initial half hour of the film are visually stunning and work to draw you in to the drug-induced psychedelic mind state and perception of the main character and observer of the film, Oliver. Even at home on the small screen the effect was quite mind- bending; in the theatre it must have been even more so. I say observer because early on in the film he gets shot in a police sting operation and spends the remainder of the film as a disembodied spirit floating around Tokyo observing the aftermath of his death and flashing back to his tumultuous childhood and relationship with his sister. But this is where the tedium kicks in. Okay, floating across and through city blocks is a cool visual trick done once or twice, as is the spiraling, slow- motion panning around and in-between scenes, but when this essentially makes up the remaining 2 hours of film it starts to get old. Added to the fact that very little happens in the scenes that aren't just fancy camera-work and you end up feeling that you're just as trapped in limbo as our disembodied guide. Eventually we pay witness to a huge orgy in a love hotel, get jizzed in the face and finally reborn to suckle on the breast of our past-life sister. The end.

Puh-leaze - why? Because of so many top angles and white pulsating lights ?!?) , while still trying to be a box-office attraction - and super-shallow at that.Noe is best at reproducing visuals and adding some shock-value to it - like his porn-music videos - but he doesn't have a clue about real human drama, characters, and emotions - especially about the characters he tries to portray. Sex can be beautiful and also repulsive, depending on the context - but based on what Noe shows in this film, he comes off as closet right-wing Republican (sex is rape and ugliness and abortion etc) - he entered the void alright, should've stuck to them music videos - slick visuals, but all else is pretense without substance.",Enter the Void
192,alicozaurul,Great idea but bad......,6,7 May 2014,"I just watched this movie for the first time, and this is my first review, so I'll do something plain and simple. At the first glance it started with a great idea : reincarnation then it failed. There is this guy, Oscar, that has a good friend - Alex - and they live in a foreign country - Japan - and they are about to deliver some drugs to another friend Victor. Before they arrive at the meeting point they talk about this Book of the dead and how the souls separates from body and takes a journey of seeing his past/present before deciding to leave this world being content or struggle to find a womb a re-live, because life on Earth is too good for him. Victor rats Oscar, he has some kind of fight with the police, does a mistake and is shot and dies. Then the good and bad parts start: there are a lot of sexual scenes, too long in my opinion, but most of them very important. There is also an incest relationship, which will give people a lot to argue about, and I am sure that happened, other posts debate this a lot. first moral problem: We see his sister doing an abortion, we see a little fetus dead, we also see at the end of a movie that a soul is going to reincarnate just after an sexual act, so is the film/Buddhist concepts implying that a soul is killed by an abortion ? second moral problem : the incest - we don't see explicitly that Oscar is having a sexual relation with his sister but a lot of clues are on for that to sustain. Some think that the sister might be aborted, or after lots of years of separation the two might not feel any more like brother but like a man and a woman. third moral problem: psychedelic drugs, I won't get into this one, seems it's not really debated in movie either, all characters are non violent at least, some just do it for money, some for fun, we see no bad side effects. fourth moral problem : betraying your friend. Victor rats Oscar to the police because he had an affair with his mother, his mother being an ex prostitute...what he expected.I must add that little Linda character was played perfect for his age.",Enter the Void

These elements, when woven together by director Gaspar Noe make for a true example of cinema as high art. That being said, this film cannot really be considered ""enjoyable"" or even particularly ""entertaining."" The best way to describe ""Enter the Void"" is as an experience. Defining a film as an experience is, admittedly, somewhat clichéd, but ""Enter the Void"" cannot help the fact that its sole descriptor has fallen victim to cliché by the hands of lesser creations. The dreamy floating camera-work that we became acquainted with in ""Irreversible"" is back this time and it seems to have found its true calling as the viewpoint of a wayward spirit. All of the performances are intensely personal and thoroughly believable. The first person perspectives could easily have been distracting or annoying, but for some reason they work and give the viewer a sense of almost hypnotizing immersion.

Or: It was impossible. ""Enter the void"" is the first film that is dealing serious with death and reincarnation. Without escaping into metaphors like most films do, when it comes to death. if you look closely you may find incredible beauty in here - but first it is a shock. There is a lot of pain in it. Gaspar Noé doesn't take you by the hand. He kills you, and leaves you alone, floating in timeless space. In ""irreversable"" a viewer still had the chance to escape.

196,macocael-353-951088,A Heady Trip through the Eye of the Camera,7,8 June 2012,"Enter the Void has sharply divided critics. Detractors loathe its ""puerile"" ideas, its banality, it contrived effects, whereas its advocates praise its technical photographic brilliance, its use of neon color, its representation of Tokyo nightlife.They are both wrong. The brilliance of this flawed but innovative film is its camera-work, yes, but not merely for the rolling camera, which is just a technical feat that, as Noé himself said, is obsessively applied. There is probably no film in history that has depended so thoroughly on the crane shot. No, the brilliance of this film lies in its reduction of the narrative to a purely photographic perspective. The camera empties out the film until it is the only light shining into the void. Movies are still very much indebted to the formal characteristics of the theater -- script, plot, dialog, character development, and so on. Noé tosses that all out. If you are looking for character growth, plot, verbal spark, you will be disappointed. The characters, though quite forlorn and tragically tinged, are banal and unchanging; the dialog, delivered in a monotone, is uninspired and uninformative; the plot is not really a plot at all, insofar as the action is connected only through the traveling camera rather than through an inexorable chain of cause and effect. The story is a bare bones melodrama, nothing more.The film titillates us with the idea that Oscar, who has been loaned a copy of the Tibetan Book of the Dead, is playing out the motif of reincarnation and is reborn in the end. The film begins inside his head, the camera establishing a point of view perspective to which it relentlessly, even annoyingly adheres until Oscar is shot and killed in a drug bust. The camera then leaves his body and floats above the city spying on the people in Oscar's life from above. It is implied that he is living out the story of the Tibetan Book: he is temporarily disembodied and seeking the means to be reincarnated. But it dawns on you after a while that this motif is nothing more than a metaphor for the camera and that the only subjectivity of any significance is that of the camera – or the movie goer. The camera is not a stand in for the protagonist; it is the protagonist. The idea occurred to Noé when he saw Robert Montgomery's Lady in the Lake, a 1947 film shot entirely in a first-person perspective. But here that first person perspective becomes an empty subjectivity devoid of personal characteristics once Oscar is dead. The camera continues to visit the various people he knows and also revisits crucial moments in his past – the death of his parents in a car crash, the separation in childhood from his sister, and the immediate events leading up to his death. But the camera is impersonal. It looks over his shoulder, as if he himself were looking back at his past self, but the irony, as well as the thematic thrust of the film is that Oscar is good and truly dead. There is nothing but a void, which we fill with our sentimental dreams and creative spirit.In the press kit Noé claimed that ""The main subject of the film is rather the sentimentality of mammals and the shimmering vacuity of the human experience."" At one point, Oscar visits his friend Alex, a painter rooming with another guy who is building a model of Tokyo's nightclub district. Oscar shines a light through the windows of the model Love Hotel and remarks that it would be fun to be able to hover above the city and peek in the windows, spying on everyone making love. This is eventually just what the camera does. The utter weightlessness of the characters strips the film of any metaphysical pretense. There is just the void. You enter the void and depart. The cycle of rebirth is merely an illusion that derives from the pattern of birth and death. Noé has said that ""it's not the story of someone who dies, flies and is reincarnated, it's the story of someone who is stoned when he gets shot and who has an intonation of his own dream."" Noé emphatically rejects any religious interpretation and does not himself believe in any religion. It is an utterly unsentimental take on life, birth and regeneration of the species (not the individual). Oscar's sister gives birth at the end of the film, and the birth of her child is merged with the birth of Oscar – but this is not rebirth: just successive generation.This is what gives weight to what otherwise would be a merely visually interesting journey or a nihilistic bit of iconoclasm; the film acquires power from the tension between our hopes, our dreams, and the brutal reality of sudden, unwilled life and death that mark the boundaries of the void. The theme and the camera-work are one. The camera is the film, it is what gives substance to the void. And each of the viewers is invited in; each of the viewers is a camera too, filming its journey through the void. Once Alex is dead, you take his place.The camera is both the engine of the film and its means of Kathartic release. The most significant aspect of its Tokyo is not the neon urban jungle of sex clubs and drug dealers, but the tight, tiny womb like cubicles in which everyone exists that are so claustrophobic as to make you queasy. The final image in the film is a birth, and that sudden rush from the suffocating canal is itself a metaphor for the release that is obtained through the camera's ability to travel over and through these constricting spaces. If there is any sentimentality at all, it is the belief in the liberating power of art despite or perhaps because of its struggle to imbue the void with meaning by giving it form.",Enter the Void

But in our age of accessing information so quickly, we can often find ourselves just ""getting to the point"" these days. I will start off by saying that this film requires patience. While you may actually get the point of this movie rather quickly, the ride itself is a long winded sermon about the sanctity of life itself.""Do you believe in reincarnation?"" is the setup of the entire concept of what could be considered Noe's magnum opus. The driving force here is that procreation is driven by empathy. The need to connect with someone on the deepest level to create life.It is filmed entirely from the perspective of Oscar, the film's protagonist, who dies unexpectedly from a series of unfortunate events. What follows after is a deeply personal journey of his spirit's observations post-life. He must witness the humanity of those he loves most, laid bare. His willingness to forgive these transgressions ultimately leads to his rebirth, and the fulfillment of his promise to his sister.While Noe's films can be considered very personal in a way, and deal with taboo that we often stride over with rapidity, it serves well for those willing to receive it. If one were willing to give these ideas a chance, and explore them with said patience, they'll find something in a film that very few directors can provide us today... life itself. While such introspection can cause discomfort in those that expect merely escapism from a film, here provided is an introspective and soulful existentialism that dives deep into the nature of human forgiveness and retribution.A film that is beautiful visually, musically, and humanely.

One could randomly cut out 1 full our of this movie, and everyone would be better with it. I can't emphasize this enough. Every. Single. Scene. Goes on for far too long. The movie is also very obvious, and treats its audience as idiots. I can't count how many times I wanted to just stand up and shout at the screen ""we get it!!!"". Somewhere, in a parallel universe there exists a way better cut of this movie, with all the best and original parts, and none of the boring self-indulgent things, that could actually be called a great movie. But sadly, in our world, this garbage exists, with a director that flew way too close to the sun.

202,gianfra-06676,"Flying camera shows us the void that is the human experience, and moral relativists hated it for that reason",9,16 November 2017,"Most walked out disgusted, some repulsed by what they were seeing. There was one person to blame for this: Gaspar Noé, the director, who had previously tortured audiences with his shocking powerhouse Irreversible (aka Monica Bellucci getting raped by a disgusting gay pimp and getting avenged by Vincent Cassel and friend via fire extinguisher blow to the head to the power of 21, all with nausea- inducing imagery and horrific violence). But don't shoot the messenger: for Gaspar's film was merely acting as a window into the void that is the human experience. I don't know what high level (?) acting some were expecting on this film, it's not like regular individuals have Broadway-levels of expression or emotion on display whenever something happens to them, there are real life dead beats out there. Plus, it's not the acting that takes center stage here, it's the visuals, the seductively nightmarish neon splashes of immorality and fever dream- ish visuals. It's painful and sometimes dull to watch not because it's a badly written piece of cinema, but because it shows us the true nature of human interaction, the black hole that is life (especially if you're an incestuous junkie with nothing better to do than getting high and leading a life of crime, sin, and overall meaninglessness). With this film, you are entering the void, and you may never return from it. An assault on the senses, a masochistic experience, but a very educational one at that. Weirdly enough, this film did not make me into an edgy nihilist, but instead taught me (in its own intense way) to appreciate life more than I did before, and compelled me to make the most of it. Definitely not a film for the faint of heart, the easily offended, or the snobbish progressive that can't comprehend that debauchery and moral relativism do not equal happiness, fulfillment, or meaning (they can't stand licentiousness being cast in a negative light, and will promptly jump to condemn the film for being too ""judgemental"" and ""self-righteous"", as if indulging in selfish hedonism without any moral guidance wasn't a bad thing in and of itself).",Enter the Void

By the end of the last ""scene"" I was pretty much just mad and talking/yelling at the movie for being so ridiculously bloated with footage. This movie could easily have been 40 minutes shorter and by that effect have been rated much higher by myself. Noe should have taken some constructive criticism from editors out there and cut out some of the scenes in the film. Sure a film can be more than 3 hours long (this one is ""only"" 2 hours and 40 minutes), but that requires more story and scenes need to contain more importance towards the plot. By comparison the film Novocento is around six hours total and while slightly frustrating, the length could be justified in it's depth of plot and acting. This movie depicts one day in the two lead characters life, plus a number of flashbacks to their childhood, used to explain their complex relationship. I liked the way the main characters actions are explained later in the film, making us sympathize with him later on in the film, but this does, as I've mentioned earlier in this review, not excuse the run time of this particular flick.",Enter the Void

The use of the camera is creative and splendid and makes the whole movie as a roller coaster ride. The special effects are really, really special. I got hooked on these technical superiority's in ""Enter The Void"" that I got all thrilled down my spine. Watching it at the cinema really gave it an incredible touch. The sound was ear piercing and in some scenes it made me jump in the seat. It could go almost half and hour without any dialog, just remarkable scenes and CGI. You could think by this description it's a joyful and happy movie, but it's really not. It's dark, sea bottom dark. This movie have everything all parents wants to keep away from their children. I just get the feelings this movie would get so censored in America it would be a whole other film when showed over the ocean. But censoring this movie is fatal and would kill it. I certainly hope everyone is going to get sucked into the void just as I did.It was a great experience, I can't deny it, but what made me put an 8/10 was the length. Sometimes Gaspar really could have made some shots shorter, there were unnatural long phases that were totally unnecessary. So that's why I give it an eight.

209,pete_hatchetharry,Stunning and beautiful....but infuriating,5,16 December 2010,"This movie starts out in a style unlike most and you feel drawn into Tokyo and the flashing lights, as you see life from the point of view of our hero Oscar. A young Englishman with an unhealthy hallucinogenic drug habit living with his sister. He has earned enough money to bring her back to his side in Japan through dealing.During the first 90 minutes we are treated to a hallucinogenic trip through Oscars eyes before he departs with his friend Alex to drop drugs off at the local club. We see drama unfold and enjoy the telling of our hero's childhood with his sister before another shock. Cleverly told through flashbacks the story is both intriguing and interesting as we examine their lives together and the effects of their actions. The visuals are amazing and the effects of flying from one scene to another are at first fantastic and dreamlike. However as you drift slowly from one scene to another you can only feel infuriated and frustrated at the plodding between the plot.Still enthralled to find out what will eventually happen I found myself fast forwarding through the last 60 minutes to the story bits. I was rewarded with some scenes of bizarre debauchery in the Love Hotel before the story finale.Having loved being shocked by 'Irreversible' I enjoyed 'Enter the Void' but was frustrated at the overdoing of the visual trips flying over and through buildings for maybe 60 minutes of the 175 minutes. If you don't mind chilling out (possibly with some chemical inducement to help) and just watching a visual masterpiece with a great story interlaced within it this movie is for you. Otherwise just have the fast forward button at the ready. Drug taking, gore, sex, and bizarre but true life acts, combine in a dream like story of life and a vision of death and fantasy.

213,zippy3-142-163341,Gaspar Noe's most audacious yet alienating work of visual splendor,6,21 September 2013,"Being a big fan of Gaspar Noe's work I went into Enter the Void with a checklist in my mind of what to expect from him. His films have certain elements that make them work, he uses a distinct style, hardcore sex, unflinching acts of violence, and to bring it all together with some sort of philosophical statement. These things are the quintessential elements of what make I Stand Alone and Irreversible so compelling. However, for me, Enter the Void contain all of these elements but they did not work to create a compelling whole. Perhaps this style does not work due to the fact that Gaspar Noe is wrapped up in his own ego and has forgotten about what made his previous two films so compelling. Irreversible and I Stand Alone feature accessible central characters, Gaspar manages to manipulate the audience into liking these despicable people by giving them human qualities and making them believable with fantastic performances. Here, the Oscar's (the films central character) face is hardly shown and does not seem to convey any sort of emotion, he is usually quite wooden and conveys everything with a bland tone. As an audience we never get a sense of a character and thus made me care less and less about the film as it went on and on. Everyone that Oscar encounters (from Alex to Bruno) feel like they are hollow video game characters who are just there to serve the plot and don't have any sort of humanity. Their performances remove any tension. Lets take the scene before Alex and Oscar go to visit Bruno about buying drugs, Alex tell Oscar about how dangerous Bruno is. That he would drug you and use you for his own sexual satisfaction. You believe this Bruno to be a ruthless man, however, when we arrive at his flat, the scene's atmosphere is calm and rather dry. Bruno doesn't feel like a threat, he never raises his voice or threatens anyone's life (not that he needs to). But we never get this unhinged feeling like we do in Gaspar's other films. I thought the scene would have had more tension if Bruno was played correctly. As Enter the Void goes on and on it becomes tedious and Gaspar seems to to indulging in himself too much, with the constant use of the spinning camera flying over people and the lurid sex. The first 60-90 minutes or so were as compelling as it could get if I got over the bland acting and enjoyed it as Gaspar Noe showing this story and not the characters. Enter the Void is made by someone who knows how to show a totally unique vision in the world where there is nothing but bland action films and I believe that is a strength to the film. Gaspar noes how to create visually striking films which compensate for the poor acting and allow for his style to arrest the audience and cause them to go into state of awe at the images on screen, I know there were points where was compelled periodically due to the way Gaspar had manipulated the camera- work and art direction. The film also explores worthy existential themes of what happens after we die and that were constantly live and a loop where there is no greater place than earth. It works to a point and then after a while I felt where I knew it was going through the contrived use of the Tibetan Book of the Dead,it seemed to serve as an explanation for what was going on in the film, ruined it's audacity and therefore more predictable. Enter the Void is a polarizing film that tries to examine the afterlife and for the most part fails due to poor creation of characters and lack of depth within it's ideas.",Enter the Void
214,jam-bone,Void indeed,3,18 November 2010,"First, Flicker is nothing new, many experimental filmmakers from the 60's made flicker films with more complex structures designed for psychedelic effects, their films were much more effective and cost very little to make.Now 50 years later, this is hailed as new, and cost 10 million dollars.Don't get me wrong, I was a big Noe fan before, loved Irreversible and I Stand Alone. The characters were interesting and in both movies somewhat driven insanely, taking the viewer along for a fun ride, with surprises, shock, and great cinematography. You were with them, cared about them even if you hated them.This film fails because it lacks this drive, I could not care less about what happens to those characters (by the way all second rate actors), And when eternal overheads repeat and repeat themselves, pointlessly, it makes you care about the characters even less, and the story is then lost and so is the attention of the viewer.I give it 3 because it was ambitious, but Noe really failed this time, I'll be looking forward to what he does next, once that crap is well behind him.",Enter the Void

He is just made out to be a human being doing drugs. No complications. From there, the protagonist is shot (still high on DMT) and the journey begins. The visuals are brilliant, and although the movie is a stunning journey, there is still a vivid story. The movie, however, has its downsides. Something that seemed to bring me down was the fact that the protagonist and his sister have a relationship border lining incest.

218,johndfox,An interesting film that could have been so much more,9,4 June 2017,"Enter the Void is a flawed, but deeply disturbing and powerful film that will almost certainly stay with you for a very long time. Through the use of superb camera-work, an unnerving ambient score and a powerhouse performance Paz De La Heurta, director Gaspar Noé sucks us into a very dark place. Of course, it is impossible to talk about the film without mentioning its fantastic first person opening sequence, chronicling the last half hour of protagonist Oscar's life. We see him take a strange hallucinogenic drug, before leaving his house and going to meet his friend, all the while being presented with a disjointed, and at times highly existential inner monologue. This scene is, for lack of a better word, astonishing, and more than sets the tone for the surreal nightmare to come. From then on, the camera, perhaps a representation of the protagonist's spirit, moves freely through space and time, never confined to one place, almost as though it were some kind of omniscient being. We are also presented with psychedelic, almost headache inducing strobe lights set against an oppressive red colour palette, which, perhaps in an inferior film, would be no more than a gimmick to masquerade artistic prowess. In this, however, the lighting serves to highlight the despair and misery the characters are living through, as we, like the protagonist watch in horror, unable to save them from their inevitably unpleasant fate. The performances are, in general, pretty good. Nathaniel Brown is convincing as Oscar, playing somebody who, while devoted to his sister's well-being, gives very little regard to the lives of others. The only performance that I would call bad comes from Cyril Roy, playing his friend, who, intentionally or otherwise, comes across as detached from the situation around him, and unable to speak without sounding slurred. The standout, however, comes from the aforementioned Paz De La Heurta, playing Oscar's damaged sister Linda, the emotional anchor of the film. She portrays someone who, though innocent at first, becomes increasingly aware, and disturbed, at the nightmarish situation she's in, and increasingly desperate for some sort of escape. All this is done with a raw emotional intensity that you simply would not see in a more mainstream film. This film is, of course, far from perfect. Its biggest flaw lies in its borderline excessive run-time, which could have been reduced drastically had Noé removed a few unnecessary scenes, or, alternatively, cut a few short. Around halfway through, we are shown a shortened version of the opening scene again, only without the first person perspective. This could have been shortened quite easily, by showing only the most crucial moments, before moving on. Towards the end, Noé starts recycling and re-purposing the same type of shot, finishing, quite disappointingly, with a visually stunning, though overlong sequence that detracts from the emotional climax of the film. Despite an overstretched run-time and occasional moments of weakness, Enter the Void is essential viewing for anyone interested in surreal, unsettling cinema.

The first two parts of this movie are breath-taking, they were an absolute pleasure to watch and I loved every minute.

This movie is unparalleled in ""drug-trip"" scenery in it's accuracy. I also enjoy the philosophy behind the movie, the idea, and the acting.However, the positive parts do not lead to a positive whole. Some how, the movie not only takes all of these great elements and makes a boring movie that is a chore to watch from start to finish, but it makes it almost unwatchable thanks to some needless, gratuitous vulgarity. Literally half of the movie has some sort of creepy incest undertones that makes the viewer uncomfortable. While I am an open-minded person that loves horribly vulgar movies, this one just didn't use the shock value correctly. Instead of being an exciting foray into the world of a drug abuser and his death, it seems to be a foray into sexuality and not so much the questions about death, which the movie seems to advertise. I understand the concepts, but it almost seems like the director did not.I can not honestly say I recommend this movie to any one, much in the same way I have difficulty recommending 2001: A Space Odyssey. The concepts of both movies are great, but the momentum is so begrudgingly slow that it almost feels like you are punishing yourself to finish the movie. Don't get me wrong, I still love Kubrick's masterpiece for it's masterful direction despite the chugging momentum, but Enter the Void seems to rely on gimmicky camera tricks and trippy visuals. The lack of a coherent story arc, while suitable for the purposes of the movie, just does not mesh well with the already slow pacing and rather hefty run-time.If this movie was truly in a first person perspective, we'd have to know everything the main character knows for it to function correctly. While we do learn a lot about the character, his family life, his childhood, and his current life, it does not come until you are already confused about some of the characters and annoyed with the pacing.I give it a somewhat harsh 3 out of 10 because it has every good element this movie needed to succeed, but the pacing and over-long run time do not allow adequate use of these elements to return a complete-feeling, satisfying film. Instead, you get a movie that will shock you, bother you, make you uncomfortable, and, most importantly, bore you to death. The pretentiousness here is too thick for me to enjoy.",Enter the Void

227,rumid,"A visionary piece of cinematic experimentation, beautiful and dark, dirty and bright",10,26 May 2013,"""Enter the Void"" (2009) the last film of the Argentinian director Gaspar Noé is a very ambitious film of 2h and 41 minutes and the result is a shocking visual and emotional experience, a visionary piece of cinematic experimentation, beautiful and dark, dirty and bright. From the beginning with the amazingly original and shocking opening titles we have already a feel of which kind of monster we are going to be confronted with. We could describe it as ""Ghost"" meets ""Trainspotting"" in a psychedelic Tokio of neon lights but it's much more than that because it is the kind of movie that enters your system and stays there for a while, visiting you in dreams and thoughts. With his previous film ""Irréversible"", Noé showed us his taste for provocation and extreme imagery. There were in there some perverted cinematographic choices, like for instance the fact of having a very shaky camera along the whole film except in one specific scene, where the camera is fixed, which is the scene depicting the rape of Monica Belucci's character, in what we could call an act of utmost depraved voyeurism. But with ""Enter the Void"" Noé has achieved a much more balanced and mature result. He is very good at digesting and recycling cinematographic references in a inventive way, in ""Irréversible"" for instance, the fact of telling the story backwards was not of his invention and Christopher Nolan did it before with ""Memento"" (2000), but Noé adds the technical prowess of doing each fragment as a long shot or ""oner"", that is a take without any cut. In the first act of ""Enter the Void"" Noé matches the point of view of the main character with the camera so we see what the character sees, integrating even Oscar's blinking as short blackouts of the screen. This technique is also not new and it was used by Robert Montgomery in ""Lady in the Lake"" (1947), an experimental film noir that was shot exclusively using this principle to the point that the only moment we see the main character is when he looks at himself in the mirror, same thing in the first part of ""Enter the Void"". But Noé learned the lesson from ""Lady in the Lake"" where due to this exclusive perspective there is a lack of identification to the character by the viewer so he uses different methods to show us Oscar's point of view, even in the afterlife. ""Enter the Void"" has a debt with Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and is no surprise since Noé acknowledges him as a big influence and there is a reference to the mentioned film in an abortion scene where we see a fetus echoing the cosmic baby of ""2001"". Beware this movie is not for the faint of heart and due to strong stroboscopic effects it shouldn't be seen by anyone suffering of epilepsy. Despite many experimental elements in the film it has a very solid narrative structure which helps us to follow it without getting lost. Oscar is a small time dealer in Tokyo trying to make money to bring his young sister Linda from whom he was separated after the tragic dead of their parents in a car accident. He made her a promise when kids that they'll never get apart from each other. They get together but things turn bad, she becomes a pole dancer in a murky club and dates Mario a local gangster and Oscar gets into big trouble because of the drug business which is severely repressed in Japan. Oscar's friend Alex a charismatic painter, has lend him the ""Tibetan book of the Dead"" which he describes it to him as the experiences that the consciousness has after death, during the interval between death and rebirth. One of the film's main themes is precisely life after death and reincarnation, everything set in an hallucinatory context induced by psychedelic drugs like LSD and DMT. Without wanting to reveal too much of the plot lets just say that the film is not all what it seems and Noé has cleverly made some things fuzzy which helps us to give the movie two main interpretations. There is a key and beautiful scene which is the final one, where the camera adopts first the point of view of a spermatozoon and then the one of a baby when he just comes out of his mother's belly but Noé is smart enough to blur the image, fact that is completely justified due to the point of view of the new born, so we don't really know who the mother is. Thanks to this ambiguity and some other key moments during the film we can elaborate different versions of what really happened. Despite all its violence and darkness, I am really happy about this movie and that there are still some people like Gaspar Noé that have the courage to go where almost nobody dares to go, because thanks to people like him movies as an art go forward. One might not like certain things or be shocked, I for instance didn't like some easy and pretentious Freudian references but it doesn't matter because Noé with this film, with its imperfections (Who wants perfection? Is perfection a human thing?), with its many accomplishments, with its brutal, dirty and dark beauty and precisely because of all that, has achieved a masterpiece that won't be forgotten for long time. Unfortunately this film which had a budget of 13 MUSD didn't managed to recover even one million. How ironic for a film that, in my opinion, will find a place of privilege in the history of movies but it doesn't really matter, what is important is that it exists. I am sure I will watch this movie many times in the future and as with any great movie it will allow me to find new details and ways of interpretation.

228,rmzeitjr,"F**k this ""Film""",1,31 August 2011,"This movie is complete and utter garbage. I got unbelievably sick of the camera effects. The constant swooping from place to place and the incredibly irritating ""trippy"" special effect just gave me a headache. Some people say that this is a great movie to watch under the influence. Let me tell you, I've done a lot of drugs and I can't think of one I would like to take before watching this film. Normally when Im under the influence I like to watch something.. you know, entertaining. Now don't get me wrong. I'm not the kinda guy who is squeamish over films like these. The thing is that if your going to make a film with scenes as disgusting as the ones in this film, there had better be a good point. When I watch a movie I believe that it should serve some greater purpose for the viewer and the world. This film did neither. Instead it was just another film that is designed to ""push the boundaries"" of what were comfortable seeing. Much like Requiem for a Dream, Gummo, or Kids, it makes you uncomfortable and serves no purpose. Don't take me for somebody who hasn't seen any of the things in these films in real life and therefor I wan't to shelter myself from these realities. No, I've seen and done a lot of f****d up s**t in my life. Some things more f****d up than whats in any of these sort of films. The depth of the characters is possibly the only thing that I enjoyed about this film. Since I can go on and on about why I find this film and films of this like horrible creations of man Ill end this review on a sour note. This film is of no benefit to human society or cinematography. Someone referred to this film as ""modern art"". If by modern art you mean completely worthless garbage then.. yes... I'd say that that sums the film up pretty well. I simply cannot understand the type of mind who would enjoy such filth. Oh and I forwarded through a lot of the pointless ""psychedelic"" scenes.",Enter the Void
229,sambahdi-1,Taxi Driver updated...,8,30 September 2010,"The shock and awe coming out of this film must be what it was like coming out of TAXI DRIVER 30 odd years ago - both films not shy to show you the perverse and depraved life of a dark seedy night time city metropolis.Recently reunited with his sister in Tokyo, drug dealer Oscar is shot in a police ambush inside a bar called The Void. When he leaves his body his only concern is to look our for his sister's well being and uphold a pack they made as kids never to leave each other and find a way back to her. What unfolds is a journey seemingly inspired by 'The Tibetan Book of the Dead' that looks like a neon lit life review filled with unfulfilled incestuous sexual wantings, a tragic car crash, city fly bys that zoom down to find glimpses of post shooting moments that his strip club dancer sister, artist friend Alex, and drug taking friend Victor go through following his death as we put the pieces together of what his short life amounted to.It's a roller coaster ride effectively shot entirely from the POV of Oscar; when I left the film and walked out into a wet Soho in London I suddenly wondered if I was still in the film and paranoid that my brain had been transplanted by Oscar's.The film is about 20 minutes too long and indulgent in parts, but a film as visceral, technically amazing and thought provoking as this don't come along often.

230,rancho45,The Emperors New Clothes,1,18 July 2012,"The Emperors New Clothes is how I would describe this movie. The story line pretty simple, it is essentially about another not to bright loser dealing drugs. As far as it being a technical ""masterpiece"" clearly some reviewers need to watch a few more movies. Lots of crane and aerial (floating)l tracking shots combine with flashing colours and iTunes (Think Kubrick's 2001) visualizer type imagery does not equal a cinematic masterpiece. Its a story void of any real charter development and there are certainly no characters that one can empathize with. You can have all the flashing colours and floating ""dream like"" sequences cut together with flash backs, but at the end of the day, if you don't care about the characters or what happens to them, then the movie has failed. No one I watch the movie with cared about any of the characters, in fact the consensus was they were quite lame. So it's back to the floating camera work.Don't get me wrong, it's watchable, almost interesting, but it's a one trick pony of a movie with poor dialogue and shallow characters.",Enter the Void
231,cramsey2,Eye Opening and beautiful cinema,10,2 September 2013,"Gasper Noe knows how to make audiences cringe and also make them think. In Enter the Void he takes it a step further and puts us literally into the protagonist's POV. We meet Oscar early on into the film, an American drug dealer living in Tokyo watching over his younger sister. Oscar meets your typical lowlifes and junkies but also trys to find a sort of meaning into life. We watch as he smokes DMT and trips for what feels like an hour but only lasts about thirteen-fifteen minutes and tries to understand the Tibetan Book of the Dead. Little does Oscar know who drug fueled world is about to come crashing down upon him.Oscar is set up by one of his friends while making a deal in a Tokyo club called The Void, while trying to elude cops he is cornered and killed in a bathroom stall. The events that take place afterwards are best left unspoiled.Needless to say this film is violent and gritty but has more heart in my opinion than Noe's last film Irreversible. The idea of reincarnation and a traveling soul fits the style that Noe is trying to accomplish while at the same time not holding the viewers hand and explaining every little detail to them. I found the film to be raw and honest and something that is definitely not for everyone. But if you're in the mood for a film that will make you think and also make you feel like you too are tripping then I strongly recommend checking out this film.",Enter the Void
232,ALatDSU,big disappointment,2,3 April 2011,"This movie was a huge waste of time. The plot, if there really is one, isn't developed. Most of the time the camera is spinning/panning just to pass time before the editor remembered to actually add a scene that is tangentially related to what may or may not be a storyline. There's plenty of near graphic sex scenes and hints of incest, but most of it, like the camera motions, just seem random and serve no actual purpose. The visuals after the first half hour or so become redundant and, again, without purpose. The only painlessly mentionable aspect was the performance of some of the actors.Overall, this was a bunch of takes and ideas thrown together and irresponsibly promoted as ""entertainment.""",Enter the Void
233,darkstar_2,unwatchable,3,13 September 2009,"I went to this movie last night at the Toronto Film Festival knowing nothing about Gaspar Noe, bot was I in for a treat... The film start with a strobe-light effect opening credits, which make you feel uneasy right away. It then shows the last 20 minutes or so of the main character Oscars life (all in first person). He is shot during a drug bust. This is where the movie starts to get weird; Oscars ""soul"" then hovers around and he re-lives his life. The movie shows his life in a disjointed way either showing his childhood or when he is an adult living in Japan. The movie seems like one continuous shot because from one scene to another Oscars ""soul"" jumps into either a light source or a black hole and then emerges somewhere else and fly's around for awhile until finding the next scene. This makes the movie drag on so much longer, between every scene there is an extra 10 minutes added. After we re-live Oscars life the audience thinks the movie is over, but no it drags on for another two hours. Showing his friends and families lives and how they react to his death, even going as far as showing his sister having a dream of Oscar waking up after being cremated. All just very odd. So the movie was EXTRA SHOCKING. and here are the highlights: we see his sister get an abortion, a dead featus, his parents faces smashed in from a car crash, and his sister getting cummed in from the vagina's perspective. A giant orgy, nipples being sucked on by babies or men in every scene, and a journey inside a aborted fetus. The movie still had its merits. Visually it was AMAZING, i have never seen anything like it before and never will again. It was truly a journey like nothing else. A movie where CGI shows its full potential without the use of giant robots.The director did get a message across, even though it will probably be different for each viewer, but a message about life/death/spirituality.",Enter the Void

A little over-indulgent for my regular cinematic taste, but a compelling story told in a truly original way. But, and this is a MASSIVE but...then the second half of the film happened. This whole section of the film was completely unnecessary, had no narrative relevance whatsoever. It felt as if deleted scenes had been randomly tacked on to the end of the film; hammering home the ""moral"" of the film that had already been unsubtly explained throughout the first half.Most annoying bits:The CGI looked well at the beginning, but the ""Schlong"" shot? Really?I could draw a map of Japan from memory with all those aerial panning shots. 30 seconds to 1 minute shots in between EVERY scene might have been worth watching... if something was actually happening. The scene in the LOVE hotel... sex=rebirth. I get it. I got the talk when I was a pre-adolescent. I do not need shiny lights emanating from ladies private parts to explain it to me visually.I can say with all honesty that as it stands this is quite possibly one of the worst films I've ever seen.

His name: Gaspar Noé.I've just come home from a screening ""Enter The Void"". Was thinking about writing this all the way home: I think he achieved an objective portrayal of the subjectivity of life. Just like Andrei Tarkovsky writes about finding bits of life and representing them in film, he has made a film which feels just like life, to me at least. It was full a mix of beauty and sightings of potential and the torture that desire and trauma in real time is.It was the sex scenes that made me think it was objective - an independent as-accurate-as-can-be - observation of the way things are. They were extremely real, practical, changing positions with a blur on the lens as no human is clear-seeing in the heat of the moment. And at the same time I was worried that my interpretation of them was subjective. To me the heterosexual sex was one of necessity, caused by unhealthy stale and needy, dependent, hormone fueled, animal desire, almost an inconvenience something that was in the way of real life. (Refering here to the end (and the middle for Linda- where there is a split look of mental absence) of the sex act in the brothel with Mario.) Sex leads 'the milf' to despair, having gambled her life for empty gratification and game. On the other hand, sex between Linda and 'the flatmate''s girlfriend is carefree and both are present and engaging, both taking and receiving. The same girlfriend seems more nursing/accommodating and selfless than anything else when her and 'the flatmate' are having sex in the Hotel of Love. I wonder if I am projecting... what did other people think of this? I have notices one other review that was concerned with Gaspar seeming to be homophobic...",Enter the Void

He attempted to overcome an extremely weak script by replicating visual and sound techniques used by talented artists like Kubrik, David Lynch and Darren Aronofsky. Be assured, he doesn't come close. Anybody who describes this film as psychedelic obviously hasn't seen true psychedelic experimental films. Seven minute sequences of kaleidescope imagery is not psychedelic, its boring, uncreative and cheap to produce. This looks like a very bad student film from a low budget school.

More colourful, pulsating, feverish and hypnotic than the first film, Void is quite a trip. But where it raises the stakes visually, it's storytelling falls short.This is coming from someone who doesn't 'like' Irreverible as much as admire it's power. It's not an easy film to sit through, and leaves an unshakeable feeling of horror well after it's over. I respect that, along with Noe's directorial talent in delivering it. In 'Void', I experienced a different journey, and one much less concerned with the characters floating through each scene.Like the neon lights of Tokio, the people in this film were simply there; moving in and out of focus, part of the visual landscape. Once the colourful assault entered it's second hour, I found myself checking my watch, looking around the cinema, waiting for it to end. I didn't care about what happened to anyone hovering under each crane shot, I just wanted to straighten out, leave Tokyo, meet another human being instead of being chastised by all the lights. It was like being given a sermon on life and death by an acid freak in a nightclub; I needed a polite way of excusing myself and finding someone else to talk to. But there was no one else, only Noe.Enter The Void is still in a league of it's own, still something wildly original in a universe of cinematic dreariness. It should be seen by anyone prepared to enter the unknown. But my god, how much more could it have been if it found it's footing on earth, as well as in the void?",Enter the Void

Some parts made me feel sick to my stomach due to the disorienting camera work and other do to the content of what was being shown. The plot was somewhat redeemed by great subject matter, however was over all poorly executed. Visual effects that added to the ill feeling in my stomach where strobing lights, odd fuzzy focus for extended periods, and jumpy transitions. The content contained surprisingly graphic (yet not at all stimulating) pornography, poorly done gore, an uncomfortable fixation with breast feeding and nipples in general, an odd semi incestuous relationship, and a rather disturbing depiction of an abortion.

239,michael-vasiliadis,Ambitious,7,26 December 2010,"If you have ever masturbated during a period of deep emptiness in your life, the feeling straight after the climax, is the feeling that I was left with after seeing Enter the Void, The First Time. This film is ambitious. It's inventive, genius, powerful and raw. In an incredibly resourceful way. Despite my suspicion the film compensated on a lack of content, with visual shock and delight, which if removed, might reveal only layers of short stacks. Occasionally, this worked against the film. Perhaps distracting the audience too far, diluting the films overall ability to translate.... Furthermore, some moments or sequences in Enter the Void were a little predictable. Possibly flat or boring too. Umm. But that might be it's only flaw. And still, I can't help but be moved and in love with this film for what it is. The film does redeem itself plenty. It's sheer invention and self-assured style, make up for the dolled-up oversupply of visual drama. Enter the Void, and from what I can gather Gaspar Noe himself, would make no apologies for it's moronic leaning toward masculinity. Instead Gaspar might credit himself as responsible for using such a perspective - to explain Love, it's sources, and it's killers, Fear. The film attempts to overcome it's own fears, with courage. Which I think might explains Gaspar's comfort at making such an overtly egocentric and personal piece, choosing to embrace itself (Gaspar and the film), with courage. In doing so the film overcomes or validates it's own nature, through saturation, as opposed to departure rejection, a lack of this embrace both in form and content, would have resulted in a completely different. A film void of the same level of capacity and commitment. All the characters in Enter the Void are burdened by something. And so we're are always looking for an ulterior motive in their actions. Even in Linda (Oscar's sister). The film reminds us of the natural need for Love. And conversely, our ability to dispense it as a false mechanism. As a trip - For tonight, for a week, Something, anything. Please - to fill this void. Overall the film opens a void, which it allows the audience to fill. An experience.

This movie is beautiful, in a kind of non-symmetrical sort of way. You jump in, brain first, to a world of unfamiliarity and colors. It is very intense at first but simmers down into ironically juxtaposed scenes of intense grief and odd sexuality. You are, in fact, the characters in the movie; Broken by life and not given more chances. You know, some are dead before they are born, right? Some are not given even one chance. Twisted and cherry picked from the cold fingers of hush-hush societies with inferiority complexes, the story of this movie highlights the human experience. We are all broken, and we are ultimately alone, but how should we deal with this? Gaspar makes a convincing existentialist argument, not through the concept of rebirth but through the hilarity of it all. You're just a stoned man dreaming before death of some kind of better alternative, but in the end we are forced to face the fact that we are ultimately alone and alone ultimately. Don't think too much about it. Take this or that drug, take your clothes off, it really doesn't matter at all. Make it a habit, and revisit it. Revisit it because you do not want to revisit other things. Shaped by our experiences, we are given a short glimpse of what it is like to REALLY be shaped by our experiences. You will have post-traumatic stress disorder the entire movie, and will relive the fatal car accident that began the endless cycle that is flirting with death. Low self esteem. Goal-less. The pit of the human experience.

I was wrong, I was wrong because watch this film whilst you have been... well you know.Any way on second viewing you notice so much more. Things like the fact you can hear the opening them tune pretty much constantly through the film. The visuals just blew me away, I was captivated. I was on the same journey as the protagonist as if I was viewing through my own eyes.The plot on first viewing was pretty weak and the acting left a lot to be desired. But on the second viewing you realise what it is trying to achieve. It's trying to evoke an emotional response. And you soon begin to feel this response which means any thought of plot is no longer need.It isn't a film you would sit down to on a Saturday night with a tub of popcorn. It's something you sit down to with a couple of mates and a...A lot of it takes place in a first person perspective. It really connects us to the protagonist because as he blinks we slowly find that our blinking becomes synced to his. Once again I say... Captivated.The sound technician is a wizard, an artistic genius. There are so many layers to the soundtrack. It's like it was all thought about, all the sounds of Tokyo. There's so many subtle touches that are so easy to miss on the first viewing. It's as if every single sound was planned and thought about and meticulously placed. Maybe I'm reading too into it I doubt it though. The intro music which sounded awful, like cats dying on first viewing transcends any prior knowledge of what a soundtrack should be. It's visual and auditory poetry, a hypnotic ensemble of the senses. There is not a single silent second in the hole experience. That's what I'm defining it as... an experience. I say it again, captivated.I really can not do it enough justice in petty words. During the death scene there are only what I can describe as binaural tones, a tone when played at a certain frequency tunes the brain so to speak. After the death scene the visuals kick up the gear. He gets sucked into this light but he rejects it, he's not ready to leave. He made a promise to watch over his sister. As you have heard the protagonists thoughts up till now you have had a guiding voice; but once he dies these thoughts stop and you find that your's do too, and this turns into meditative trance and all you have to go on are your primal sense of sight and audio. There a hints of incestuous feelings between the brother and sister this is evident in a few scenes.A psychologist could write a thesis studying the brother sister relationship and the affect losing their parents had on them. I'm going to leave it there I think. Not much more can be said about how genius this film is. It's got so many individual layers all working to get an emotional response.This isn't just a film.

His sister, a more recent arrivee to Japan, works as a stripper in the same neighbourhood. As children, brother and sister were orphaned in a car crash. Whenever director Gaspar Noé seems to think we may be in danger of forgetting this fact, he treats us to a yet another flashback in which we relive the crash. This happens four, five, six times -- so many times that the viewer will begin to question if it ever will stop happening. This film seems interminable at times. Oscar has been reading the Tibetan Book of the Dead, which is, like, totally far out, maan. It says that when you die, your spirit leaves your body and floats around for a while, then you see your own life in fast-forward, then you see for bright lights for a while, then you are shown some possible futures, one of which you will be reborn into. This is the cue for the drug bust by the Japanese police, in which Oscar is shot dead. (Spoiler: during the ""my life flashing before my eyes"" segment, you will spend about 45 minutes staring at the back of the main character's head.)If Noé had had the self-discipline to edit his film properly and to keep it internally consistent, this could have been an interesting cinematic experiment, with plenty of cult potential. But the reality of the thing is a 160(!)-minute contrived, incoherent, embarrassing, bottomlessly pretentious and bottomlessly irritating mess.The film runs utterly out of ideas ideas no later than 90 minutes in, at which point the viewer merely begins to wait for it to end. The last 30 minutes or so are perhaps some of the most exasperating cinema ever produced -- not merely boring or repetitious, but downright aggressively, militantly shitty movie-making. And this is the ""short"" version of the film -- the director's cut apparently runs well over three hours. Enter the Void is visually innovative and it obviously required quite a bit of technical know-how to get the long overhead camera runs right.

Dozens of other reviewers have already done that, and to be perfectly frank, I do not agree with them. However, what I will touch upon is what many other reviewers apparently didn't grasp. First of all, I'd be willing to wager that the vast majority of them have never experimented with psychedelics (especially DMT), nor have they a background in philosophy, nor have they lived as an expatriate in a foreign land. If you are a fan of typical Hollywood blockbusters or just enjoy nice and tidy movies in which the plot is character-driven and everything logically proceeds to a predictable end, skip this film. While I do agree with many that the movie can drag on in parts, I can understand why it does so. The entire point of the flying and drifting around is to accentuate the bewilderment, isolation, and uncertainty that a disembodied soul were to experience upon death, especially within the context alluded to by reference to the Tibetan Book of the Dead. Yes, it is long. However, the film makes a deep impression and the seemingly ""boring"" parts are excellent for contemplation. If you have no background with hallucinogenics and are not much of a soul-searcher, you will likely think that this film is terrible. A lot of other reviewers on here think that it is far too sexually explicit,indulgent, and blatantly provocative. I disagree. I also contend that the relentless first-person perspective perfectly suits this film and feels natural. If you are uncomfortable with scenes from the film it is a clear indication that you have not experienced much in life,especially the darker aspects of living, loving, and becoming. ""Enter The Void"" masterfully depicts an array of feelings, ideas, and experiences that have been ignored in film or incorrectly portrayed... until now. I will say nothing more of the plot, technical wizardry, or shock factor - that has already been covered in other reviews. Needless to say, this movie is NOT for the conservative and / or closed-minded. It has been ages since a film has left such an impression on me. Yes, it is a bit bleak and disturbing, but in a good way. LIFE (for those paying attention, not dazzled by media brainwashing and / or pop culture) is disturbing, weird, and just plain unfathomable. I give this film 8/10 stars because it IS a bit too long. If some of the flying / floating in the latter half of the film were shortened or replaced with something more substantial, this flick would easily be a 9/10 or even a perfect 10/10. I cannot wait to see what Gaspar has for us next.",Enter the Void
253,jankyjay,One of the worst films I've ever sat through.,1,26 August 2012,"Save yourself the 2 and a half hour yawn-fest. This movie drags on and on and on with no point or any relevant story, which is entirely depressing, as the plot synopsis sounds great and very entertaining. If you decide to attempt sitting through this snooze-fest, prepare for non-stop camera panning and zooming as if it were shot by a first year college film student, coupled with enough color-blasting flashes and strobe-like effects to give you epileptic seizures. The acting is terrible, and I almost felt embarrassed for the actors/actresses. There are some mildly amusing CGI ""trip"" scenes that would probably be very interesting if you were under the influence of something, but they stretch on for far too long. As a matter of fact, this whole damn movie stretches on for FAR too long. Every thing that happens takes 10 minutes to occur. This is probably why it's a 2 and a half hour film. It takes 10 minutes for someone to even place a phone call, then (surprise!) MORE CAMERA PANNING AND ZOOMING! WOW!I get it, that it's supposed to be ""artsy"" and shot in 1st person as if it were through the lead character's eyes. It's not ""artsy"". It's repetitive, annoying, and frankly headache-inspiring. The camera does NOT need to do a full 360 and then zoom in full range in EVERY scene.The beginning half is basically a skinemax softcore porn with some neat colors and drug-use. Hooray for ""art""! The second half was watchable, but barely. The cheesy camera effects never stop, not once, throughout the whole film. The characters are barely believable, and the fact that every single event takes 10 minutes to unfold does not change either. To top off all of this, I'm genuinely surprised I didn't have a seizure from all the generic strobe flashing effects. This movie is a total waste of production and viewer's time. If you want a good, intense, gritty druggy film go watch ""Requiem for a Dream"". This movie (Enter the Void) is garbage.",Enter the Void
254,chelseamproductions,This movie will leave you thinking for days.,10,13 July 2015,"I wouldn't recommend this movie for everyone, but I think everyone should at least check it out. I'm not a person who likes a lot of artsy-type movies, but I really enjoyed this movie. When I first watched it, I didn't know if this was going to be one of my favorite or least favorite movies, but after a few days, I came to the conclusion that it's one of my favorites. Some ideas were pushed a little too hard, and the ending was a little bit predictable, but I think that was intentional. The music and cinematography worked cohesively to the point where you really thought you were in the movie. I have never experienced a level of immersion quite like this.I also found it interesting that at the beginning of the movie, I felt this would be better experienced on drugs, and by the end, I don't think I'll be touching drugs for a long time.In the end, you walk away from the movie wishing there was more. Definitely different, but very interesting to watch.",Enter the Void
255,sabareesh10,The most intense movie experience ever,10,3 August 2013,"The raw powerful imagery and a plethora of psychedelia that this movie throws at you isn't everyone's cup of tea and that explains the movie's dismal performance at the box office and the largely negative reception.But for those willing to experiment and are looking for an out of movie experience this movie will leave you changed. It explores the life of Oscar who lives in Tokyo dealing drugs to make a living. His friend Alex and sister Linda are against this profession of his. However, when he goes to a night club to deliver drugs to his friend Victor the police barge in and corner him in a bathroom stall. He gets shot by the police trying to flush his drugs.What follows is Oscar's out of body experience with flashbacks from his past.The movie is art in its purest, unadulterated and unrestrained form. The movie puts to film a chemical trip and goads you into thinking beyond the four walls that is your mind. It disturbs and enthralls in equal measure. If the visuals do not induce you into roller coastering I don't know what will.What this movie lacks in story or dialogue, it more than makes up for in experience. 10 out of 10 indeed.",Enter the Void

257,jay_wigger,There's a reason it was nominated for the Palme D'or at Cannes,7,27 May 2014,"Unless you're an avid cinephile, the name Gaspar Noé may not mean much to you. And if you have heard of the Argentinian/French filmmaker, it's most likely because of an infamous 12-minute explicit rape scene in Irreversible, his bold 2002 experiment in reverse- chronology storytelling. Regardless of which side of the fence you fall on regarding that scene, Irreversible is undeniably a visually powerful film from an audacious auteur. Seven years later, with his first English-language feature, Enter The Void, Noé has upped the innovation ante, delivering an audio-visual masterstroke whose plot and performances - admittedly not the reason to want to watch the film - unfortunately leave something to be desired.The concept is intriguing: Oscar (newcomer Nathaniel Brown) and his sister Linda (Paz de la Huerta of HBO's Boardwalk Empire and Nurse 3D) live in Tokyo, selling drugs and stripping, respectively, to make ends meet. The catch is that we are seeing things unfold from Oscar's point of view, in the cinematic equivalent of a first-person shooter video game. When, early in Enter The Void's two-hour-and-forty-minute runtime, a drug deal goes bad and Oscar locks himself in a bar's bathroom to try and ditch the goods, we experience him getting shot and dying in the room. He sees his life, including the horrific car accident that took his parents' lives while he and his sister watch from the back seat, in a flashback sequence and then things get really strange. The camera starts floating up and away from Oscar's lifeless body, and the audience realizes that the camera has become Oscar's tortured soul. The rest of the film revolves around Oscar's soul flying over buildings, moving through walls, and entering people's bodies in an effort to come to terms with his death while making sure his sister and friends are going to be okay. It's hard to judge Brown's performance as Oscar, since we rarely see his face, but apart from newcomer Cyril Roy - who escorted a nervous friend to the audition only to be selected himself - who turns in an amusing and realistic performance as the siblings' artist friend Alex, the acting in the film is pretty 'cardboard', especially de la Huerta, who seems to only have one emotion and one facial expression regardless of whether she's mourning her brother's death, dancing for her customers, or having sex with her boss.As mentioned earlier, Enter The Void is not a film that people will watch for the story; the name itself denotes that. In an early scene, as Oscar and Alex walk to the bar discussing The Tibetan Book of the Dead and its theories of reincarnation, we already know where the film is going, structure-wise. But it's the visual and - to a lesser extent - audio presentations that make Enter The Void a film to be experienced. Noé has taken many influences, from 1947's Lady in the Lake with its first-person point of view to Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey with its tricked out visuals, not to mention the aforementioned Tibetan tome, and forged a truly unique viewing experience. Right from the frenetic, Vegas-style opening credit sequence, straight through to the final scene of Oscar's 'rebirth', the audience is in for a visual treat and will not notice that the film is over two and a half hours long. Some of what you see may need to be experienced a second time to truly appreciate the innovation that went into it. For example, in one of the few scenes in which we see Oscar's face, he's looking at himself in the mirror, and every few seconds the screen goes black for a second or so. It takes a while to realize that this isn't a glitch in the film; it's what Oscar is seeing (or not seeing) when he's blinking. It's the little tricks like this that make the high-concept Enter The Void a film well worth seeing. Docked a point for its so-so story and largely cardboard acting, Gaspar Noé's Enter The Void is still a film well worth seeing, especially for people interested in the finer points of filmmaking. There's a reason it was nominated for the Palme D'or at Cannes and that it won a special jury prize and the award for Best Cinematography (awarded to Benôit Debie) at Sitges. It's a film that is destined to be shown in college filmmaking courses for years to come. Whether you think that's a good or a bad thing will also give you your answer as to whether you might want to see it. Oh, yeah, one more thing: if your eye is quick enough to catch it during the credit sequence at the beginning of the film, that's this reviewer's son credited - albeit with his last name spelled wrong - as one of the two children who played two-year-old Oscar.",Enter the Void
258,Briandaly816,This film will change your life.,10,6 November 2014,"This is the one and only film that I have ever referred to as a masterpiece. Noe's innovative vision was displayed on screen more successfully than any film you've ever seen. No director has thought this far out I the box before. The is shot from the POV of a man's soul as he experiences the steps of death according to the Tibetan Book of The Dead. This film completely changed my perspective on not only modern filmmaking, but on life. After watching the film, I felt something no film has provided before. I truly felt I got a first hand view of what happens when you die. The shots are from a completely different league. Not only are you hypnotized from the story, but the shots/changing of perspective MAKE THIS FILM A MASTERPIECE! YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN A FILM LIKE THIS BEFORE. Watch it with an open mind!To end this rant, I'd like to add that I find it ridiculous that this film wasn't given more respect/appreciation. I think the reason for this is that it was completely ahead of its time.",Enter the Void
259,EndijaKitsune,Amazing graphics and storyline - Would re-watch it again.,9,12 April 2015,"P.S Don't watch this movie if you don't like to get really deep into movies and their meaning behind everything they show you and if you don't understand art and the abstract way of showing thing.My friend advised me this movie. I really liked the mood and the quality of it. The graphics were really great, but I advise not to watch it while being sober. Watch it while you're high, the effects will look a lot better and it will be easier to understand the meaning of this film. And also watch it with someone who really loves to get into long talks about life and just philosophy in general, as there's so much to talk about. While watching it sober, it kind of got really tiring at the end, or it just may be my little attention span. I really loved the philosophical meaning, about reincarnation and life on the other side aka what happens when we die. Eastern culture, has always interested me, because there's something magical about it. I'd definitely re-watch this movie again and again, as there's so much to see in it, that watching it once doesn't even do the justice.I'm giving it 9 out of 10, because I think this movie is a masterpiece.",Enter the Void
260,felipedigre,intended to be deep but ending up being a long torture,4,12 September 2015,"Don't get me wrong, the visuals are amazing but in the end it's just a movie for pseudo intellectuals who think being tortured by a director is deep and brings a broader understanding of life, art, etc. If you enjoyed this you probably are masochist. The same thing could have been done without having to stab you in the heart emotionally. In the end it's just 2 hours of shock therapy and emotional distress with trippy visuals. Please be aware that if you have any history of epilepsy this movie can be quite dangerous. The director intently uses flashy colors and and strobe light effects to enhance the visual experience. Even if you are not epileptic you may end up having a headache.",Enter the Void
261,dakota-53810,The single worst movie I have ever seen,1,21 January 2017,"Let me preface by saying I've seen thousands of movies. I've seen many of the movies often regarded as the worst. Plan 9, the room, Tarzoon, underground comedy, puppet master sequels, paranormal activity sequels, an American Hippie in Israel, highlander 2, Catwoman etc. I've seen almost every Adam Sandler film and Steven Seagal, every rob Schneider, Nick Cage, Pauly Shore, and Van Damme. Obscure gay independent films and films meant to create a state of mind like being on drugs. My point is that I have every basis for comparison when I say the following: Enter the Void is by far the worst movie I have ever seen. It has no redeeming qualities. From the Bafflingly awful direction to Weaponized dialogue used to attack the audience all the way to the twist at the end, only surprising inasmuch as you wouldn't believe someone would have the balls to make it that lame and uninteresting. The bizarre birds eye shots and shifts in camera angle give the viewer the impression that this was not really a movie. Not so much as an art project for students wanting to reproduce the effects of torture. It is not bad in a fun way, it is not campy, it is not ironic. It is just painful. Worth seeing only to calibrate your opinion of all other movies. This is bedrock with nowhere to go but up. If a perfect movie were a 10 then enter the void would define 0. Unfortunately the system won't let me rate that low.",Enter the Void
262,chadlingard,Nothing quite like it,9,13 September 2016,"Holy F*cking Sh*t Balls...Not really a review. More like gushing fan mail. I don't have enough superlatives to describe how visceral and real this is(on one hand) and completely out there on another(hand). How ever trippy it is, what really moved me was how REAL some things felt.It was awesome to see Tokyo 'behind the scenes', all messed up, pimpy and dirty as hell. It's a breath of fresh air to see a major city for what it is(actually);a cesspool of too many people occupying the same piece of land. Hollywood always likes to employ the 'best of tourism pics' when it shoots something on location-this film, shows you the mould growing on everything.The high rise drug dens and neon sex clubs and the way they are portrayed make you feel as if you are about to catch a venereal disease on your eye balls.The long trip scenes and uncomfortable flights over the city(and inside it-LOL) almost make you wonder if the afterlife exists and if Gaspar Noe was somehow privy to it-it almost made me believe in a god.What I enjoyed most is how the gritty, real elements of the film flow into this drug fuelled, afterlife fantasia and the effect it had on me. The first time I watched this film I had a full blown panic attack, imagining what my own death would be like and the experience stayed with me weeks after. I love a film that gets under your skin and changes you(they are so rare).Noe has the courage to show life without the trappings of the romantic age:the world, for the most part, is not a pretty place and more often than not there is some f*cked up sh*t going on somewhere. Even when I watched his more recent film 'Love' I got the same impression:THIS is real life.As such it wont make you feel good or comfortable or happy but even so, one can't help feeling that this film is nothing short of a pure affirmation of life.Whatever your tastes, if you haven't seen this or one of his other films, you just don't have a conception of what cinema could be in the modern age.Well worth it's extended run time.",Enter the Void

My advice is experience it in best and biggest screen you can , at night , without any break or disruptions, and with all your focus.And watch it more than once. I think, feel , understand different things every time I see it.But keep in mind that this movie is ,like all the Gaspar Noe movies, a bit polarizer.

I disagree with all these things and feel that, having experienced the world through psychedelics and having seen the dark kind of underground portrayed in this film, that its dreamlike, sinister, and scattered narrative is appropriate.I also feel that it's a film that you really need to sit through and pay close attention to. It has a lot of very powerful and controversial messages to throw at the audience, and those easily offended might have trouble looking past this instead of understanding their place in the context of the story. After all, the end, to me, is beautiful and makes the rest of the film worth it.As pretty much everyone seems to agree upon, the visual aspect of the film is just breathtaking. One particular scene toward the end is the best depiction of what the world looks like while tripping that I've ever seen. Beyond the psychedelic imagery, the whole movie is just pure eye candy.In short, it may be challenging to some but if you really watch through it it's a phenomenally profound and rewarding journey that has you leaving the theater in a trance, pondering deep philosophical questions.",Enter the Void
265,atalkrishnanamk,Noe's Psychadelic Drama,8,25 August 2018,What makes interesting to watch Gasper Noe movies is his art of breaking the current wave of movie forms. Enter the void is surely his masterpiece.,Enter the Void
266,tiedomusic,An apt title,1,15 February 2018,"Never before had I walked out of a movie theatre. But this movie proved to be such an enormous amount of pretentious negative BS that I decided to stop being polite and respectful. This flick didn't deserve that. Not my attention, nor my time. Not my money too, but alas, too late. I was told that the movie cost 24 million to make and grossed only 1 million. So justice is already there.The plot is made up of pseudo-spiritual drivel. Thin as the ice on a lake after one night of frost. And it's all explained in one the first scenes of the movie. So as an audience member you must sit through more than two and a half hours of grueling and totally predictable clichés, watching this tiny plot unravel as was predicted by one of the characters. How deep it all is!That's my main problem with this particular piece of sick ""art"": the suggestion of deepness. Deep thoughts, rich symbolism, intangibility and mystery, rawness and confrontation, life and death. Plus an overwhelming array of startling and bewildering images (and sound effects).What is actually offered instead, when you look past the charade, is a so very often depicted world of drug users and whores, living on the edge in some metropolis somewhere in the world. Superficial and bent on shocking the audience. Nothing deep about that. It's like Hollywood with sour popcorn.
Simply distasteful. And nothing new.The moment I chose to walk away from all that was when I saw child actors (really young) obviously being abused to serve the director's sick purpose. 
Now THAT I couldn't and wouldn't take anymore.I can't believe that anyone with a keen eye is willing to swallow such utter nonsense which isn't even worthy of the moniker ""film"". It's rather an abuse of that medium, I find. May the director soon be cured of his mental ills so he won't bother movie-goers much longer. That would be my advice (maybe Lars ""von"" Trier can join him, another troubled man of the same kind, in my mind).Enter The Void, it's quite an apt title. Devoid of real meaning, only smoke and mirrors, very cheap.

270,evansentchef,A window into an existential realm you never knew existed!,9,28 November 2018,"I will preface this 'critique' with the caveat that this is the first review I have written and my viewing of this title was a few year ago... I am by no means a 'movie buff' however ""Enter the Void"" still grips me to this day and obviously enough to elicit the writing of this review...I was first captivated by 'Enter the Void' after seeing short bursts of this film on Foxtel. After the initial fascination I knew it was a movie I had to save for later viewing and subsequently switched channels and put it to the back of my consciousness. Sometime later I revisited the thought of watching this movie and decided to do a little investigation on IMDB, subsequently learning it was a movie by Gasper Noe of ""Irreversible"" fame; my interest peaked to say the least! Intuitively I knew this was not a movie per say but instead a portal into the patchwork of an alternate reality! This really is a movie that you NEED to set your mind and environment for in order to appreciate the underlying fabric of this 'film'. Enter the Void is NOT a movie you just switch on and watch; it is an experience that you build yourself up to and only then can you hope to strap yourself in an enjoy the ride! I cannot vehemently state this enough! My ideal surroundings for viewing this film would be solitude, introspection, the cover of darkness, and some wine! Everyone is different but I hope you get my drift.As other reviewers have eluded to this is a film with Buddhist undertones and my humble suggestion would be to engage in 'mindfulness' and just let the movie take control and override your senses. Trust me you will be rewarded with an experience that will colour your psyche and give a unique insight into the existential notions of life. It will have you thinking about the meaning of your life and this truly can be an overwhelming experience. It brought out many emotions in me that still stick with me to this day and to be honest I don't know if I have the emotional strength to withstand a second viewing despite my curiosity of going deeper into the void.Others have pointed out the licentious undertone of many characters in this film, and the heavy darkness this bequest upon them on viewing. However, and in the hope of sallying forth, I do not believe a 'nihilist' framework as portrayed by the protagonist in this movie is 'negative' or perhaps counter intuitively devoid of emotion and worth; I believe it allows for a deeper examination of our being in this expansive world and whatever conclusions you arrive at they are all positive and genuine; nothing can be more comforting than having a grasp on reality however difficult it may be. This is a matter for philosophical debate however I am merely pointing our the emotions this movie can stir within you.As I am sure you have gathered this movie covers vast expanses of human nature and considering this it really is impossible to get everything right regarding character development and general directional constructs ect. For example in my view some of the relationship boundaries were exaggerated and could have been toned down a notch particularly with the brother sister dynamic. However, one cannot expect perfection especially when considering the depth of this movies content. I will briefly say that In my opinion all the characters did a marvellous job and it really is refreshing to see new and 'raw' faces that buy into Gasper Noes vision so selflessly. There are scenes in this film I will never forget especially the grungy 'toilet scene' which precedes the deliverance into he void as well as some of the dialogue between the protagonist and his sister and best friend Alex. the Special mention to the little girl in some of the scenes; I can honestly say her portrayal was hauntingly realistic to the point it was disturbing and infinitely memorable. Further the sounds and impulses generated by the musical score and idiosyncratic camera angles give a lasting impression of the underbelly of the setting in Tokyo.All in all an absolute masterpiece in my view and one that no matter your opinion is really a must watch at least once in your life. Kudos to all involved and thank-you for the trip into the void!",Enter the Void
