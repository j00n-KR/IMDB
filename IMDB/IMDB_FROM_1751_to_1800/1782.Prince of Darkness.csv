0,Leofwine_draca,"Style over substance, but thanks to Carpenter it works",7,12 October 2016,"One of Carpenter's lesser known horror films, but also one of his best. Well, I liked it, but opinion is usually divided. Some love it, some hate it, I'm in the first half. PRINCE OF DARKNESS tells the story of Satan's return to Earth, and mixes religion with science in a brilliant way. As per usual in a Carpenter film, we get a varied group of characters who are likable and easy to identify with.Donald Pleasence heads the cast as a priest, and actually gets to battle Satan at the end. Just what I love to see. The other cast all do fine jobs, especially the Asian guy who I really felt for. The concept of Satan's return in a modern world is handled very well, and makes for a really riveting film. Unlike THE THING, Carpenter keeps the special effects to a minimum in the film, but the final scene is very good (I won't spoil it for you, but it involves Donald Pleasence and an axe, so it can't really fail).There are a couple of stupid things in the film, like some dated makeup, but it doesn't really detract from the story. The only flaw I could see was the fact that the final battle between good and evil wasn't handled too well, but instead became survivors vs. the monsters, which we have seen oh so many times. The way in which the possessed people can't be killed is very effective, bringing back memories of NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD.I liked the way one of the dead people, a black guy, kept on giggling all the time. Actually it reminded me of Dwight Frye as Renfield, from Universal's Dracula. The massing of insects on windows also favourably reminded me of THE AMITYVILLE HORROR. Out of interest, '80s rock star Alice Cooper, who performed some of the soundtrack, also appears in the film as a tramp. Sadly he doesn't get killed. If you enjoy this film, Hammer's QUATERMASS AND THE PIT is a little similar in theme (and I find it a far-fetched coincidence that the writer here is created as Michael Quatermass). Well worth a watch.",Prince of Darkness
1,SnoopyStyle,quite good B-movie horror,8,27 August 2015,"A priest (Donald Pleasence) shows a hidden container in the basement of an L.A. church to theoretical physics Prof. Howard Birack (Victor Wong). The professor recruits his students Brian Marsh (Jameson Parker), Catherine Danforth (Lisa Blount), Walter (Dennis Dun) and others, to examine scientifically the container. Theology student Lisa (Ann Yen) translates a mysterious text which has differential equations long before calculus was invented. The container has a lock that can only be opened from the inside. There are strange people lurking outside and soon the scientists are trapped inside the church with Satanic forces hunting them. Radiologist Susan Cabot is the first to be possessed by the liquid squirting into her mouth. The group is receiving a message from the future in their dreams.This is a well made B-movie horror. The casting of Alice Cooper is a little on the nose. It's not filled with jump scares. It's filled with a creepy feel where the supernatural is something with a scientific explanation but we're not advanced enough. It's a great conceit. This is very memorable horror film with John Carpenter throwing in some very interesting moves.",Prince of Darkness
2,claudio_carvalho,Creepy,7,23 October 2007,"When the guardian priest of an abandoned church in Los Angeles dies, Father Loomis (Donald Pleasance) finds a diary and a key, opens the door of the basement and finds a cylinder with a gruesome green fluid. The priest contacts Professor Howard Birack (Victor Wong) in the local university and he invites a team of students to research the findings and translate manuscripts. The group discovers that the liquid is the essence of evil, actually Satan's remains, and has been kept locked in the church for centuries. Their research awakes the son of the Devil and when the student Susan Cabot (Anne Marie Howard) gets close to the container, she drinks a jet of the green liquid, transforming in a living dead. Susan spreads the liquid among her friends, increasing the army of evil zombies. While the group is attacked inside the church by the zombies, derelicts surround the church trapping them inside, and Satan tries to bring his father to the world.""Prince of Darkness"" is one of the creepiest movies of John Carpenter. The claustrophobic tale is original, with a dark atmosphere and even twenty years later is still very impressive. The special effects and make-up are scary and the music score of his authorship is also excellent. Alice Cooper is amazing in the role of an insane homeless killer. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Príncipe das Sombras"" (""Prince of Darkness"")Note: On 11 Sep 2020. I saw this film again.",Prince of Darkness
3,kosmasp,Sloppy,8,4 October 2020,"Dated and aged this movie has - but it still holds up. Yes we have cell phones now for example, but you could do that game and critisize other movies for certain cliches and ridiculous things the movies did. This is all about mood (and soundtrack, Carpenter is famous for doing music for them), rather than story itself. But that doesn't mean this is hollow (unlike the evil within) - on the contrary, the story is quite intriguing, if paper thin or quite quick to summarize.Horror can be devastating, for various reasons. This has a group of people some of which you won't get to know a lot of, but that is always the case if you have assemble of people. Still works its charm and you will still root for them (hopefully and mostly that is). Then again, if you are an Alice Cooper fan, you may feel differently, no matter what that would mean for humanity. Carpenter knew how and whom to cast - and this being part of his ""trilogy"" of movies that are only connected thematically, not otherwise, makes it a must watch for some anyway. Really good movie and while the 4K may not be up to some of todays standards, it still looks quite great! Which is important in a movie like this",Prince of Darkness
4,gavin6942,One of Carpenter's Least Appreciated But Great Films,7,24 October 2012,"A research team finds a mysterious cylinder in a deserted church. If opened, it could mean the end of the world.Of all of John Carpenter's films, this one is among the best of the lesser-known ones. Sure, everyone knows and loves ""The Thing"" and ""Halloween"", but I do not think that many people are aware of this one -- and yet, it is one of his stronger films in many ways. Certainly better than ""Ghosts of Mars"" or ""The Ward"".Seeing Donald Pleasence here as another Loomis (perhaps related to Dr. Loomis, perhaps not) is great, and I only wish we could have seen him in more films. His body of work is amazing, having worked with many greats, from Roman Polanski in ""Cul-de-Sac"" to Dario Argento in ""Phenomena"" and beyond...I find it interesting that today Alice Cooper is used prominently on the film's DVD cover... when his role is rather minor, and he has no speaking lines whatsoever. I feel like this film is now remembered as the one with Cooper, and it is not really accurate (if you want to see some real Alice Cooper horror, watch ""Monster Dog""). Of course, he did bring his own props to the set...The strength of this film is its minimalism. Much like ""Assault on Precinct 13"", we have a small group of people in a building surrounded by other people who are hoping for their demise. Carpenter excels at making a big film from a small budget, and this film clearly shows that. The only down side is that the editing ended up with the pacing being a bit slow. A few seconds snipped here and there could do wonders.As usual, Scream Factory has released the must-own version on Blu-ray for the fans. Mysteriously, the package only mentions the Carpenter audio commentary and the new interview with Alice Cooper. That is just the beginning of the features, with composer Alan Howarth also interviewed, an episode of Sean Clark's ""Horror's Hallowed Grounds"" and a Q&A of Carpenter at Shriekfest 2012. The features along are worth owning the disc.",Prince of Darkness
5,lee_eisenberg,early LA,7,16 January 2012,"I've liked every John Carpenter movie that I've seen, and that includes ""Prince of Darkness"". The movie is of course about an old church that houses evil. Sounds pretty simple. Well, they've got some surprises in store for you, and not just because Carpenter went so far as to incorporate physics.But even beyond the plot and special effects, the movie gives me the impression of early Los Angeles. The setting in the old church brings to mind LA's status as a Spanish mission a few hundred years ago*. The Spanish never guessed that this place that they called La Ciudad de Nuestra Mujer de los Angeles (the city of our lady of the angels) would one day be...well, what LA now is. And let's face it: is there a neater setting for a horror flick than an old church containing an evil entity? Anyway, John Carpenter made a really enjoyable movie here. I certainly liked it.*It would also be interesting to learn the history of the Indians in what's now LA.",Prince of Darkness
6,Woodyanders,"One of Carpenter's most eerie, unsettling, and underrated films",8,26 March 2014,"A team of scientists and graduate students discover an ancient canister in the basement of an old abandoned church which contains a potent evil force that if unleashed could possibly destroy mankind. John Carpenter does his customary sterling job of crafting a powerfully brooding gloom-doom atmosphere that becomes more chilling, intense, and unnerving as the gripping narrative unfolds towards a heart-racing climax. Moreover, the quantum psychics aspect of the story comes across as really inspired, original, and interesting, with a strong and provocative underlying theme on science versus religion. In addition, the script has a depth and intelligence to it that in turn makes this picture much more than your standard mindless scarefest. The sound acting by the able cast rates as another major asset, with especially praiseworthy work by Donald Pleasence as a jittery, yet heroic and stouthearted priest, Victor Wong as the pragmatic Prof. Howard Birack, Jameson Parker as the charming Brian Marsh, Lisa Blount as the sweet and courageous Catherine Danforth, Dennis Dunn as obnoxious wisecracking jerk Walter, and Peter Jason as the jolly Dr. Paul Leahy. Rocker Alice Cooper has a cool secondary role as the creepy leader of a gang of sinister street people. Further enhanced by Gary B. Kibbe's smooth widescreen cinematography and a magnificently moody pulsating score by Carpenter and Alan Howarth, this movie deserves to be held in higher regard by both Carpenter fans and horror buffs alike.",Prince of Darkness
7,Tweekums,A creepy classic from horror master John Carpenter,8,3 July 2019,"As this film opens an elderly priest dies shortly before he was due to see his cardinal; in his possession is a key. This is passed on to a new priest; it unlocks a door to a basement which has, for several hundred years contained the imprisoned Satan! The priest believes the ancient evil is about to escape so invites Howard Birack, a professor of quantum physics, and his students to help investigate. The students are sceptical but strange things start to happen; homeless people, acting like zombies gather outside and whenever they sleep they experience the same dream which may be a message from the future. It isn't long before the danger is clear to them and they are fighting for their lives against an evil that is now inhabiting the bodies of those killed.This film might not be Carpenter's best known or his scariest but it is still well worth watching. For the most part it eschews obvious scares in favour or a sense of creepiness. Later on there are more gory moments; aided by impressive physical effects. I really liked how the story combined a religion based evil with the ideas of quantum physics. The cast are solid; most notably the excellent Donald Pleasence, who plays the priest and Victor Wong as the professor. As is often the case those playing the students are a little old for the roles but they perform well enough. Some may find the early scenes a little slow but for me they served to gradually raise the tension as we learn more about the evil in the basement. Overall I'd certainly recommend this for fans of Carpenter's other films or those who enjoy 'religious horror'.",Prince of Darkness
8,BA_Harrison,Susan. The radiologist. Wears glasses.,4,20 May 2016,"I last caught Prince of Darkness on VHS many years ago; all I could recall from that viewing was a pink swirling mass in a glass cylinder and Alice Cooper as a bag-person. As it happens, it was a green swirling mass. The film is that memorable.Cooper actually has a very small role in the film, despite being featured prominently in the marketing. The real stars of the piece are Donald Pleasance, who plays a priest, and Lisa Blount and Jameson Parker, who play Catherine Danforth and Brian Marsh, two of a group of talented college students drafted in by Prof. Howard Birack (Victor Wong) to run tests on the aforementioned glass tube of rotating green goop. What the scientists discover is that the spinning mass, which has been kept hidden by the Catholic church for thousands of years, is the essence of Satan, and it wants to get out.Clearly taking his cues from Nigel Kneale's Quatermass works (there are numerous references to the writer's creations), Carpenter blends science and theology to create a frustratingly dull film lacking in genuine atmosphere or decent scares. The action unfolds at a snail's pace and is accompanied throughout by an equally plodding soundtrack, one of Carpenter's least effective scores.Despite its supposedly intelligent premise, Prince of Darkness actually works best when it is at its least cerebral, offering up some cheesy special effects set-pieces (a man transforming into bugs and a woman possessed by Satan who can regenerate severed limbs), but there simply aren't enough of these to alleviate the boredom.",Prince of Darkness
9,paul_haakonsen,A very atmospheric and genuinely creepy movie...,7,22 October 2020,"""Prince of Darkness"" is definitely one of the more genre defining and memorable horror movies of the late 1980s. And that is definitely because of writer and director John Carpenter's accomplishment with this particular movie project.The atmosphere in ""Prince of Darkness"" is something that really works for the movie, as it intensifies throughout the course of the movie, and the events that transpire in the storyline add layers upon layers of atmospheric dread and suspense. So it gradually builds up and director John Carpenter delivers a very nice presentation of the movie to the audience.This 1987 horror movie is driven by a very well-written, detailed and intense storyline, wherein some adequately detailed characters mill about. But for me, it is first and foremost the storyline and the atmosphere that defines this movie.The movie has a rather good ensemble of actors and actresses on the cast list, some very iconic faces from the 1980s, with the likes of Donald Pleasence, Victor Wong, Dennis Dun and Peter Jason. And it has always been enjoyable to watch Alice Cooper in this movie, despite of not actually having that big of a role to play.Visually then I will say that ""Prince of Darkness"" actually still managed to hold its ground even now in 2020. Sure, the effects are somewhat outdated, naturally, but they actually still are watchable and passable today. The special effects actually still work quite well even for a movie this old.If you haven't already seen ""Prince of Darkness"", then I can warmly recommend that you do so, because this is definitely one of the more memorable of horror movies that made it out of the late 1980s.My rating of ""Prince of Darkness"" is a seven out of ten stars.",Prince of Darkness
10,Quinoa1984,"kind of like a semi-experiment for Carpenter; not one of his very best, but you can tell he tried",7,8 February 2007,"What a strange experience to see Prince of Darkness and how it falls in line thematically with some of Carpenter's best (the main one being characters who are trapped in a situation/environment that will have them destroyed one by one unless something's done to stop it), even if it misses the mark of greatness. That doesn't mean I didn't have a great time watching parts of it though, and it's far from being the mis-fire some critics claim it to be. If there is any one single problem, I think, it might be that the plot itself is a little cooked-up too much. It has all this mumbo-jumbo about physics and religion merging together to discover what Satan and his father, the 'anti-God', will have in the possible destruction of Earth (a couple of times I was reminded amusingly of Ghostbusters). Sometimes the exchanges between Donald Pleasance's Father Loomis and Victor Wong's Professor are intriguing, and if Carpenter had decided to dig a little more into some of the mystery and theology behind it all it might've held more interest. But by the time he gets to the green goo container, which will end up being the quasi-Maguffin for everything else that occurs throughout the picture, suspension of disbelief takes hold and it's got to stop making sense and be scary.That last part, on the other hand, does actually work pretty well though, and all in all Prince of Darkness does contain some of the most incredible imagery in any Carpenter film I've seen so far. He's really experimenting at times, really, even within the folds of a 'green-goo-will-make-you-Satan's-zombie' horror show. I wondered, for example, if he'd seen any Bunuel, particularly Un Chien Andalou, before making the movie (bugs, bugs and more bugs, in some of the creepiest material I have maybe ever seen in a horror movie from the 80s), as there's a level of surrealism at work that makes it more than just the average gory geek-show. Not that Carpenter and his make-up FX and special effects crew don't deliver the goods, and between the somewhat inane dialog and should-be-funny banter by the quirky Asian supporting character (who in one of the funniest contrivances is stuck in a room next to some of the zombies), there's plenty of eye-catching stuff to go around. But I really liked how he did go for more than what the somewhat kitchy 50s sci-fi plot entailed, and even gave Alice Cooper some entertaining stuff to do with his zombie-ness.Featuring that unmistakable Carpenter music track, as well as his finite widescreen cinematic eye (even in those hand-held dream scenes), it's a pretty good entry in the director's catalog of work in his best decade, and while it's not an instant classic like They Live or The Thing, it's got some shocking punches to throw and even some gallows humor. 7.5/10",Prince of Darkness
11,BandSAboutMovies,A warning sent from the year one-nine-nine-nine,10,12 September 2018,"The second film in John Carpenter's ""apocalypse trilogy"" (The Thing and In the Mouth of Madness are the other two), this was the first movie in his deal with Alive Pictures, which guaranteed him complete creative control if he made each film at a budget of $3 million dollars.This is probably the only horror movie that you'll see that is all about theoretical physics and atomic theory, as well as secret religious orders and the Antichrist. There's also plenty of Nigel Kneale (Quatermass and the Pit) influence here, which Carpenter tips his hat to by using the alias Martin Quatermass for the screenplay. From messages from the future to ancient evil finally being unleashed on the modern world, it could be a Kneale film, but the British writer was displeased with being associated with the film (he had previously worked with Carpenter to script Halloween 3: Season of the Witch, although his name was removed when he objected to producer Dino De Laurentiis adding more gore to the film).A priest (literally, that's his name, but he's played by long-time Carpenter associate Donald Pleasence, although I've also heard him referred to as Father Loomis) discovers that a member of the Brotherhood of Sleep has died just before an important meeting with the Pope. It turns out that an abandoned church in inner city Los Angeles contains a container of green liquid that is the secret to the inverse side of God, literally an Anti-God. Whatever is inside that container is alive and able to transmit long streams of complex data that needs to be analyzed by Prof. Howard Birack (Victor Wong, Big Trouble in Little China) and his students.One by one, those students are taken over by the Anti-God or killed by the homeless people and insects that surround the building, led by Alice Cooper. Also, every single person who hasn't been killed or taken over starts to have the same dream, one where a shadowy figure emerges from the church. Each time they have this dream, a warning sent from the year one-nine-nine-nine, they see more detail. This part of the film, shot on video, played on a television and then reshot with Carpenter's voice intoning the warning message, are some of the strangest and most surreal sequences ever included in a mainstream film.
Soon, one of the researchers has been transformed into a vessel for Satan and the evil forces are attempting to pull the Anti-God out of a mirror. Much like Ghosts of Mars and Assault on Precinct 13, this is another Carpenter riff on Howard Hawks' Rio Bravo, with a group of survivors stuck inside a building, trying to survive an evening worth of attacks.I can't say enough about how much I love this movie. It has great little character bits, moments of true horror and even some great compressed storytelling. I love that instead of a long explanation of how a physics professor and a Catholic priest would be close friends, one student just off-handedly mentions that they both were part of a BBC exploration of God's existence. That's all we really need to know and it lets us answer that and move on to more important matters.You just need to watch this movie. Luckily, Shout! Factory has released a great version of it. I mean, how can you not love a film that theorizes that Jesus was an alien and the Catholic Church has known that all along and kept the secret that another alien, an evil one, was on its way...or has a scene where someone just keeps typing ""I live!"" over and over again, then this message: You will not be saved by the holy ghost. You will not be saved by the god Plutonium. In fact, YOU WILL NOT BE SAVED.""",Prince of Darkness
12,Coventry,"Simple, effective and ingenious horror from John Carpenter!",8,25 April 2004,"John Carpenter can be a very creative and stylish filmmaker when he's working with a small budget and more or less anonymous crews. Yet, it had been since The Fog that he worked under these conditions and therefore `Prince of Darkness' is part of his best achievements, according to me. `The Thing' and `Christine' may be successful and widely praised horror highlights, but they lack Carpenter's typical low-budget charm and his demonic visions are more limited in those, I think. Carpenter's screenplay and scenery for this film is ultra-morbid and relentlessly cruel. Evil does exist and it's homed in an abandoned church near Los Angeles! When a priest opens the basement door and discovers a vat containing a green liquid. The priest contacts a group of physics graduate students to investigate it. Unfortunately, they discover that the liquid contains the essence of Satan himself. From that moment on, Satan will do whatever it takes to release HIS father, who's an all-powerful Anti-God!  When you're a fan of horror, dark aspects of religion or morbidity in generalthis plot-outline almost sounds like delightful music and it IS!! From start to finish, Prince of Darkness is a slow-driven suspense film with good acting and unbearable tension. Acting legend Donald Pleasance was a brilliant choice to play the priest and there's so much more to discover than a simple good vs. evil battle. Carpenter adds the brilliant idea of `the Brotherhood of the Sleep' This principle causes everyone in the group to dream the same sinister dream! The images of these dreams (in which humans are used as some sort of supernatural receiver) are truly haunting and nightmarish. John Carpenter never showed his horror talent as clearly as here in my opinionThe atmospheric beginning, along with the fluid camera-viewpoints slowly turns into an exiting and bloody climax, filled with obscure violence and nasty make-up effects. Great film and highly recommended as it is one of my favorite late 80's horror entries!",Prince of Darkness
13,hitchcockthelegend,Then it really is Old Scratch knocking at the door.,7,15 October 2015,"Something of the forgotten John Carpenter movie, Prince of Darkness shows both the good and bad side of the supremely talented director.The story is a beaut, a bit skew-whiff, but unmistakably Carpenter territory as Satan exists in some sort of parallel universe. How he manifests himself is narratively a bit tricky, but still it makes for good horror, especially as the old religious angle finds Carpenter - in the guise of Donald Pleasence - chortling away to himself in a way that Old Nick has been prone to do.Cue bugs, green goo, zombies and a centuries old sect determined to keep Satan out of our world. The scares are many, atmosphere bubbling away (in time with another of Carpenter's pulse beat synth musical scores), while the finale has a genuine surprise up its sleeve.Unfortunately the cast are playing second fiddle to the supernatural strengths, working from a script that doesn't sit at one with the screenplay, rendering the characters as uninvolving fodder. Yet be that as it may, it's still a film of delights, enough in fact to make it a top end entry on Carpenter's CV. 7/10",Prince of Darkness
14,Theo Robertson,Carpenter Starts Losing It With This Film,4,9 August 2002,"Difficult to believe nowadays but John Carpenter was once a highly regarded film maker with a string of low budget big hits like ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13 , HALLOWEEN , ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK and THE THING. He also looked at one point of being on the road towards mainstream film success with the sci fi love story STARMAN but for some strange reason he decided to start making crap like PRINCE OF DARKNESS which more or less killed off his reputation.
I will admit I did enjoy bits of PRINCE OF DARKNESS because I`m a fan of Nigel Kneale in general and his QUATERMASS serials in particular . Carpenter crams many injokes into PRINCE OF DARKNESS which I managed to spot: He uses the pen name of Martin Quatermass for screenwriter , the students come from Kneale university , there`s a couple of characters called Marsh and Lomax named after Characters from THE QUATERMASS EXPERIMENT , plus there`s chunks of dialogue taken from QUATERMASS AND THE PIT and THE QUATERMASS EXPERIMENT , and let`s not forget that the plot of the mythical Satan being from another planet and living dormant in a canister owes more than a little to QUATERMASS AND THE PIT. But that`s all I really enjoyed about this film which is boring ,humourless dull and very dumb. It also suffers from some very wooden acting not least from Donald Pleasance. Say what you like about Pleasance but it`s not often you see him give a wooden performance.Carpenter improved somewhat with THEY LIVE an interesting but dumb satire about an alien conspiracy theory , but after that he went freefall into a series of totally forgettable movies from which it`s unlikely he`ll ever reclaim his once high regard",Prince of Darkness
15,Scarecrow-88,Prince of Darkness,9,22 April 2007,"Father Loomis(Donald Pleasence)wishes for Prof. Howard Birack(Victor Wong)and his class(..along with some other students majoring in other scientific fields)to use scientific data by way of technology and computers in deciphering what the ancient text written means guarding a mysterious green, circulating liquid inside a canister predating millions of years. The Brotherhood of Sleep was a secret sect of Catholic priests who guarded the canister also re-writing over the text during a many years so that it could not be understood by the outside world. Whatever is inside that canister, the Brotherhood wished it to stay there. Loomis only realized all of this once the elder priest guarding the room dies. What they discover is, I believe, that an anti-god(the negative side of God)roaming the earth was condemned to darkness while his son, Satan, was placed inside the canister..that very canister containing the green liquid is he. Weird occurrences around the church begin surfacing such as derelicts surrounding the building watching in a gaze(..killing anyone that might exit the church)and insects such as ants and worms collecting on windows amongst other things. Jesus Christ, the text announces, was an extra-terrestrial who tried to warn others but was killed. Jesus' disciples were able to successfully cover it up by fabricating the truth using the false doctrine by what we read in the bible. Now Satan is growing powerful..the canister is no longer able to hold him as the liquid splashes in the mouth of a student zombie-fying her. She subsequently ""turns"" other students into zombies by passing the liquid from her mouth to theirs. A small group remains, led by Brian and Catherine(Jameson Parker & Lisa Blount) along with Birack, Walter(Dennis Dunn), & Loomis trying to find away out of the church when it seems that another student(..with a specific mark on the arm signifying her as the chosen vessel for the remaining liquid)is chosen as the host for Satan himself! It seems that there's no escape. Satan invades the chosen host like a parasite invading a foreign organism taking it over. To top all this, Satan wishes to free his master from the darkness(..using the mirror as an entrance into the world). A premonition ""signal"" is sent to many as they sleep verifying a certain event to take place traveling to them from light years in the future!To be honest, the film is quite confusing and demanding, but also quite creepy and haunting. Who the figure is in the premonition is a powerful image that stays with you. The idea that the evil Prince of Darkness awaits the chance to enter our world condemning it is a scary aspect, but seeing our heroes trapped inside while demonic possessed humans await them outside and inside is just as frightening. The story is so convoluted, though, it's no wonder many don't care for it. The story regarding the evil our characters are up against and the dialogue(scientific gibberish)spoken by Birack & his students can be exhausting for those who can not understand it. But, the film has enough terrifying aspects, I believe, to retain interest. In my opinion, it's one of Carpenter's scariest, most effective horror films on his impressive resume. I'm guessing some may find the strong religious subject matter, heavy in the cryptic jargon between the characters, who also use scientific language frequently, might turn many away head-scratching. Hell, I'm not even sure my explanation of the synopsis is absolutely accurate. Probably a film many might return to over and over just to see if they can penetrate it further than the last time.",Prince of Darkness
16,preppy-3,Bottom of the barrel,1,23 February 2001,"A bunch of stupid college students (led by Donald Pleasance) discover the portal to Satan in the basement of an old abandoned church. Satan wants to enter our world...and can possess the students to get in...or something like that. First off, I'm a big John Carpenter fan. I think he's one of the most talented directors out there. But every director has a bad film (or two or three) in them. This is Capenter's worst. Slow, boring, dull, lousy script, even worse acting. It just plods along. I had trouble staying awake (which explains my vague synopsis of the plot)!If you want to see a good Carpenter film? Rent ""Halloween"", ""The Fog"", ""Big Trouble in Little China"", ""The Thing""...but avoid this one at all costs. I'd love to know what Carpenter thinks of this movie now.",Prince of Darkness
17,LeonLouisRicci,Effective and Eerie,8,5 June 2013,"One of the Director's most underrated Movies. This is almost a bona-fide Classic. The thing that keeps it from such an exalted status is a few major missteps. It starts with a very creepy setup and manages through most of the Film to keep that sense of Impending Doom with its Supernatural and Apocalyptic tone.The use of Ancient Texts and Religious language Prophecy is introduced but somewhat abandon as things unfold, giving way to more conventional displays of Zombie like Characterizations and Gore Movie conventions. When a Text translation is rendered on a computer screen... the goosebumps arise. The scariness is lessened by the end of it all as the Director veers away from the unseen Evil and things get a bit standard. Such as some unnecessary attempts at humor and a denouement that is a reflection of a weak wrap-up. One more item...hopefully, it should be clear by now that Sci-Fi Writers should completely avoid using specific dates in their Stories. It is a Death Trap, because as you discover here, the Dream induced message is coming from the year 1999. Oops!",Prince of Darkness
18,poolandrews,"""If I don't come back you can have my Porsch."" Decent supernatural horror from John Carpenter.",6,21 January 2006,"Prince of Darkness is set in San Francisco & starts with a member of the Brotherhood of Sleep, a secret order of the Catholic Church, dying before he can have an important meeting with a cardinal, he is clutching a small silver chest containing a key as he passes away. Father Loomis (Donald Pleasence) travels to St. Goddard's Church & after opening the basement door with the key Father Loomis discovers a cylinder with a green glowing liquid inside. Father Loomis calls in his friend Professor Howard Birack (Victor Wong) to help him investigate, Birack rounds up his students & a few other people who may be able to shed some light on what the green liquid is & they all meet at St. Goddard's with the intention of spending the weekend there. As they run tests on the cylinder the mystery deepens, it seems to have a psychic aura, it's carbon dated as being over seven million years old & can only be opened from the inside. They also find an ancient book of text that they begin to translate. As the day turns into night the Church is surrounded by the homeless who prevent anyone form leaving & the liquid enters people's mouths starting with a radiologist named Susan Cabot (Anne Marie Howard) who then walks around in a zombie like state, the rest of them begin to fall as the prince of darkness tries to enter our world...Written under the pseudonym of Martin Quatermass & directed by John Carpenter Prince of Darkness won't appeal or please everyone, personally I thought it had some interesting ideas & is a decent watch but ultimately unsatisfying & a bit too muddled. The script says things about religion & secret societies within the Church but it all comes across as pretty flat. Some of the ideas just don't work that well & the juxtaposition between religion & ancient beliefs along with factual science doesn't sit too well. I think the idea behind the possessed insects is that the devil can control lower life-forms & the weak easier which makes a somewhat racist, snobbish & uncomfortable statement when it refers to the homeless if that what Carpenter intended. There is also a bizarre but sort of neat concept about our dreams actually being messages sent from the future to warn us that crops up every once in a while. The film provides fair entertainment & I have to at least give it credit for being different which is an usual trait these days.Director Carpenter does a really good job & the film oozes atmosphere, tension & has a nice horror vibe throughout. The lighting & cinematography have style. The violence is somewhat disappointing, there is a stabbing with garden shears, someone is impaled on a bike, a self throat slitting & someone literally falls apart as loads of insects emerge from the various body parts.With a fairly modest, but not too low, budget of about $3,000,000 Prince of Darkness is technically very good, Carpenter knows how to make a horror film & co-composed the terrific & very effective electronic synthesiser musical score. The acting varies from bland & forgettable to OK & rocker Alice Cooper has a cameo as a derelict.Prince of Darkness is not Carpenter's best by any means as I still think The Thing (1982) takes that particular honour but I am pretty confident in saying that it's far from his worst. I think it's well worth a watch but certainly has it's flaws.",Prince of Darkness

He contacts a physics professor (Victor Wong), who brings a research team to the church to investigate. The research team includes a risibly-mustachioed Jameson Parker, the always-amusing Dennis Dun, Dirk Blocker (son of Bonanza's Hoss), and a few relatively forgettable actresses. I should also point out this entire team of graduate students seems to be in the 30-45 age range. The investigation turns up shocking results as the team discovers the liquid inside the container is the Devil or Anti-God or son of the Devil....it's something bad, for sure.This is one of the most divisive John Carpenter films, even among his fans. Most people either seem to love it or hate it. I know when I first saw it back in the early '90s I hated it. I thought it didn't make a lick of sense and the male lead was one of the all-time great movie goobers. It left such a bad taste in my mouth that I refused to even try it again until about five years ago. But when I did, my opinion of it changed quite a bit. I'm not saying I'm now part of the ""love it"" crowd. I still believe it's flawed and has some elements than can only be enjoyed on a tongue-in-cheek basis. But I do like it a lot. I have watched it several times in the last few years and have grown to appreciate it more each time.Some genuinely creepy moments, nice gross-out effects, and a very tense last 30 minutes that ranks among Carpenter's best work. Also, another terrific Carpenter score. I don't even mind the cheesy relationship between Lisa Blount and Jameson Parker or the terrible lines they both have to say to one another. Little bits of corn are kind of expected with Carpenter. It's part of his style. It's definitely a unique movie. I can't think of anything else quite like it.",Prince of Darkness
20,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Pure Carpenter,7,2 May 2008,"Do you like John Carpenter, and/or his work? If the answer is yes to at least one of those, I'd say that you're pretty darn assured enjoying this. Of course, I'm not going to cut this short at that... that would make for a somewhat unsatisfactory review. The plot is very good, and develops well throughout. Acting and casting range, but nothing is below average, and there are some really creepy performances among them. Pleasance is his usual charismatic, talented self. Characters are well-written, credible and consistent. The pacing is spot-on. John instills fear, builds tension and keeps you interested with skill matched by few. There is excellent atmosphere herein. There is some humor, as well, and none of it is forced. There are pure, and rather enormous, nuggets of gold within the script, and none of it is bad. The effects are nicely done. The score, of course by the director/writer and so on and so forth, himself, is magnificent... it's about what we are used to hearing from him and his features, the synthesized sound that he masters. Not his best, perhaps, but it certainly is effective and awesome... in fact, that basically goes for the entire film. Now, granted, I have only watched this once, but I am definitely going to do so again. This is classic John, him at his most impressive. This had me in a tight grip every time it attempted to gain such, and sure managed to scare me. There is some violence, and while it isn't the most gory, it is pretty disturbing at times. I recommend this to fans of the people who made this, John Carpenter in particular. 7/10",Prince of Darkness
21,view_and_review,The Devil Bleeds Green?,5,10 September 2019,Some strange things begin to occur in a derelict Catholic church somewhere in southern California. This primordial ooze being housed in a large glass cylinder started to be active and exhibit paranormal activity. The priest of that church (Donald Pleasance) sought the help of a local professor and his students to figure out whether this phenomenon was spiritual in nature or merely scientific.The science of it all became immaterial as colleagues were being killed and controlled by the forces attached to the green liquid. Maybe this was Satan after all but with a different back story than is commonly narrated.This movie didn't move the needle for me. I couldn't get behind an evil ooze being the antagonist. I know it's all supposed to be the devil but the giant jar of green Kool-Aid is what was the primary focus. It just looked too silly to see people with mouths agape getting squirted by evil embalming fluid. The Prince of Darkness is a theme that has been repeated many times in many different forms--this wasn't one of its best.,Prince of Darkness
22,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Pleasingly enjoyable but still flawed effort,8,7 January 2014,"After discovering the contents of a long-hidden canister may be the Devil incarnate, a group of students studying the device along with a priest find themselves subject to nightmarish attacks as the possessed locals try to free him in order to reign over Earth and must stop the harrowing situation.This here is one of the more enjoyable and undervalued efforts in this particular genre and really has a lot to like about it. The extended set-up here in the beginning allows for a pretty involved storyline to come through quite naturally with the historical significance given through the dialogue which is where this really gets it's power from. The main factor in enjoyment, though, comes from the exceptionally tense and well-crafted series of sequences in the later half that show the possessed attempting to free the captured canister in a slew of siege attacks and encounters that work two distinct story lines, not knowing which among them are possessed thus fighting within each other, and fighting off the swarm of people outside trying to get in. That leads to a ton of fun here, with scenes such as the hallway confrontation, the race to get out of the confessional before it's dismantled and the final battle in the basement where the constraints of time and space are bent as the team battle to stop it from fully crossing over into the world from another dimension in a harrowing series of intense moments that really makes for quite a thrilling time. Added together with some great kills, grisly possession make-up and a sense of class about it for such a cheesy storyline, there's a lot to like here but it still has a few faults. The constant need to switch in a series of distorted, dreary visions that serve no purpose to the action is a big one here, as the only clue we get to it's purpose is given at the end which means the rest of the time is used to mainly serve as jump-scenes to show the dreaming character startle themselves away and it gets rather old quickly when, like the majority of the film itself, doesn't spend a lot of time really utilizing any sort of explanation for what's going on. There's a lot of inference that must be made here, and that tends to leave this one feeling rather confused easily.Rated R: Graphic Violence and Graphic Language.",Prince of Darkness

To their horror, they uncover a nightmarish truth about this liquid, and the oncoming apocalypse from an age-old evil that will engulf them all, unless they can find a way to stop it...Though this has an ambitious script, and intelligent ideas, it is ruined by excessive & nonsensical violence, that really has no place in this story.

24,movieman_kev,under-rated but far from Carpenter's best,6,29 March 2007,"When a group of scientists and students go to a long abandoned church all hell attempts to break lose in this under-rated lesser known John Carpenter film. Coming off as a decidedly more supernaturally-toned version of his earlier 'Assualt on Precint 13', Prince of Darkness still stands on it's on feet thanks to good performances and a fairly creepy atmosphere throughout, even if his anti-establishment kick is less entertaining here than it was in ""They Live"" The biggest detriment to this film is self-inflicted by Carpenter himself when he declared this movie the middle film in his 'Apocalypse Trillogy' thus lumping it in with ""the Thing"" and ""In the Mouth of Madness"", and while this film is good, it still can't help but pale against either of those two classics.My Grade: C+",Prince of Darkness
25,The_Void,"One part boring, one part stupid and two parts rubbish",3,7 November 2004,"John Carpenter is a director that I don't rate. Even his best films (Precinct 13, The Thing, Escape From New York) are disappointing, and overall his films have a very 'dumbed down', almost horror for kids, sort of a feel, and since I like my horror to be rough and ready; Carpenter just doesn't appeal to me. This film is without doubt one of the worst Carpenter films I've seen (second only to 'They Live' for absolute worst, as it happens). Carpenter is a big head, and after his successes, his films seem to exude a mentality of ""look at me, I know what I'm doing"", when in fact he quite clearly doesn't know what he's doing. The latter half of his career is, in fact, merely tributes to his earlier work; which only shows how gargantuan his ego is. The tributes shown here are to Escape From New York (the zombie like inhabitants that line the streets), The Thing (the way that people get infected) and there's a backwards tribute to Assault on Precinct 13, except this time the assault comes from inside rather than out. However, despite the fact that he's tributing his best work; Carpenter has failed to create anything that even resembles a fluid and coherent plot.The plot follows a bunch of people that find a vat of green slime underneath some building, which then causes English priest Donald Pleasance to team up with that Chinese guy from 3 Ninjas and some guy with a dodgy mustache to rid the world of evil...I think. Then, somewhere along the line, people start turning into zombie type things, and there's something to do with a mirror that Satan is behind for some reason, not forgetting this whole 'Brotherhood of the Sleep' thing, that causes people to have strange dreams. As you can see; this film tries to blend together many plots, but as I can tell you; it doesn't pull them off. The script for this film is lack lustre to say the least, and John Carpenter isn't able to get past this to tell a story that is coherent and makes sense. Carpenter also manages to spoil the film with an absolutely awful soundtrack that plays throughout and manages to diffuse every moment of tension that the film may have had. The fact that the soundtrack, composed by Carpenter himself, plays all the way through only further reinforces my point that Carpenter is a huge egotist.Prince of Darkness is a messy and un-assured film that seems like the work of an amateur, not a well-respected horror director. Through confusing plotting and dull characters, Carpenter has created something that is truly horrible, and I don't mean that in a good way. I recommend recommending this film to people that you don't like, but otherwise; staying clear is the best way.",Prince of Darkness
26,zetes,One of Carpenter's best,9,17 October 2010,"You don't hear too much about this one when people talk about John Carpenter, but, in my mind, it's easily one of his best films. It's very original, well paced and damned frightening. Donald Pleasance is a Catholic priest who recruits his friend, Victor Wong, a physics professor (Victor Wong, of Big Trouble in Little China), to draft a bunch of his best grad students to study a large vial of green liquid that is supposedly an ancient relic. The grad students, being people of science, find the assignment very silly, but it's definitely weird and has some unexplainable stuff going around it. On the base of the vial there is a Latin inscription that claims that the liquid is the essence of Satan, which will someday be used to bring back Satan's father to rule the Earth. Soon enough, the liquid finds its ways into the mouths of a few of the students, who become possessed. Dennis Dun of Big Trouble in Little China appears as one of the students. Highly recommended for fans of the director, and horror fans in general.",Prince of Darkness
27,Mr-Fusion,Scary stuff,8,20 October 2011,"I can only imagine how unsettling ""Prince of Darkness"" was back in '87, but even today, it is all manner of creepy. This is quintessential John Carpenter, from the widescreen shots, that dilapidated church in the middle of urban L.A., to the unrelenting feeling of dread (the music on this thing!). The story hook of smashing together science and religion - Carpenter with a heaping dose of Lovecraft thrown in - it's a heady mixture, to be sure. And there's some silliness in this movie as the church is being overrun by the possessed, not to mention Alice Cooper stabbing someone with a bicycle 0 although that might not strike everyone as silly; personally, I think it's awesome.But any hokey subject matter is more than made up for by that video transmission and final scene.

29,christopher-underwood,The green stuff is well done,7,1 December 2018,"This takes a bit of a while to get going, although it is intriguing enough to hold the attention. Mostly pseudo religious mumbo jumbo but the naturalistic acting is persuasive and Donald Pleasance gives the proceedings some gravitas as we move forward. We seem to notice Alice Cooper and the street folk before the main characters but that's fine. Its the same with the various team members that go missing and nobody but us seems to know what has happened to them. The minimal Carpenter soundtrack is effective and gets more pronounced and frenetic as we go along, in harmony with the general rising panic. The green stuff is well done and the hands going into the mirror impressive (mercury apparently) as an air of paranoia is reached and we head to a loud and dramatic climax.",Prince of Darkness
30,siderite,How the world has changed,7,11 February 2015,"I grew up with movies like The Thing and They Live, I also vaguely remember Prince of Darkness. That should immediately tell you that this is not one of those movies that you tend to remember. But what got my attention today, after watching both In The Mouth of Madness and Prince of Darkness, is how dated these movies now seem. The approach to science is quaint, the way people relate to one another is weird, the acting method is different, the scares are different as well. And this is not some 1920 Lovecraftian story, it's a movie from less than 30 years ago. How the world has changed.Prince of Darkness is a film with a well done feel, but a ridiculous premise. I can't really tell you why it's ridiculous without spoiling it, but the brilliant and ingenious way they defeat the Prince of Darkness at the end was hilarious. The story goes like this: A priest dies and so it comes to light that he had the son of Satan locked in a jar in his basement. A team of scientists get together to analyse the strange object, only they do it in the most peculiar way (by staying in another room and letting 286 PCs keep it company, while they bicker and talk aimlessly).The way the people in the team get either killed or infected by the evil stored in the ancient container is what makes this film spooky and scary. The few seconds of Alice Cooper as a murdering street bum are effective as well. The way the ""scientists"" behave, though, makes me laugh and the ending is ludicrous. The acting is decent, especially by the Asians in the film :), but some of the actors are inconsistently bad sometimes.The thing is that if you take away the Carpenter feel of the film, you remain with a really cheesy and outdated feature. I don't regret rewatching it, but I am confident I will very soon forget all about it.",Prince of Darkness

33,sddavis63,One Of John Carpenter's Weaker Films,2,21 May 2010,"John Carpenter has made some very good movies. ""Halloween,"" ""The Thing"" and ""Christine"" immediately jump into my mind. But, for some reason, he also made ""Prince of Darkness."" This entire movie came across to me as silly rather than scary; gross rather than horrific. The acting ranged from so bad that it was funny (Walter panicking in the closet, jumping around and screaming ""they're trying to kill me"") to Donald Pleasance's overly ambitious attempts to try to make it seem as if he's taking this seriously.The movie revolves around a strange, secret society within the depths of the Catholic Church (very original) known as ""The Brotherhood of Sleep"" (which I was very tempted to join at times while I watched this!) Apparently this brotherhood had for some reason and in some way contained (what would I call it) the essence of Satan in some green, gooey liquid stored in a sealed container in the basement of a church. Somehow, the goo gets loose for the purpose of reproducing itself by taking over bodies, turning them into Satan's minions and then bringing - well - the Prince of Darkness himself into the world - through a mirror! OK.Apparently Satan's minions can be brought under control by spraying a shaken up can of Sprite into their eyes (although one would think that the acidic content of Coke would be more effective!) and, of course, if you break the mirror Satan can't enter the world - a broken mirror is apparently very bad luck for the Prince of Darkness. There are a few times when you laugh at this, and in fairness Carpenter does have almost the whole thing infused with an effectively creepy soundtrack playing in the background almost continuously.

34,gridoon,Mediocre horror thriller.,5,10 July 2000,"This pretentious and cliched horror film apparently wants us to take it much more seriously than we should. The script, both confusing and simplistic, is filled with predictably ""ominous"" images (crawling insects, murderous zombie-like figures, praying priests) that are supposed to give it an ""apocalyptic"" quality, but most of the gimmicks don't work and the film is hardly ever scary.

It soon becomes apparent that the green goo which swirls inside this sealed tomb may be pure evil, but can the group prove it? The screenplay manages to mix science and faith together in a fairly seamless way. It, essentially, explores how the seemingly supernatural may in fact be quantifiable, a product of elusive quantum physics. It's both science-fiction and fantasy, a concoction of the two that seeks to establish they may simply be two sides of the same coin. Most of 'Prince Of Darkness (1987)' is dedicated to building a sense of dread. With its dark, throbbing synth score and its portentous dialogue, the thing succeeds in creating a palpable atmosphere that's actually somewhat unsettling at times. Its actual ideas are a little unnerving, too (I won't spoil them here, though, since much of the picture is shrouded in mystery). As the affair moves towards its finale, it picks up the pace and transforms into something that actually sort of resembles Carpenter's earlier 'Assault On Precinct 13 (1974)'. Here, the tension is cranked up to eleven and a number of unexpectedly grisly special effects start to come into play. It's a great final act and it rounds off the rather distinct experience in a suitably unpredictable way. Overall, this is an effective and entertaining horror movie. It's an unexpected mix of genres (and, even, ideologies) that works far better than you may expect it to. 7/10",Prince of Darkness
36,callanvass,A work of brilliance! John Carpenter sure knows how to scare the living daylights out of me!,10,18 September 2013,"I am a staunch supporter of John Carpenter. I cannot understand for the life of me why this movie is so criminally underrated. It really is incredulous to me that so many people don't place this as one of Carpenter's best films. I'm gonna go out on a limb here, and say this is John Carpenter's second best film, next to Halloween. It is very religious heavy, but this honestly scared the hell out of me. This movie relies a lot on atmosphere, and boy does it do the job. Quite a bit of the first half is all build-up, and it enables you to soak in the atmosphere. Alan Howarth & John Carpenter collaborate for an absolutely chilling score. Some of the images are especially memorable. I can't believe I'm saying this, but some of the creepy images are partly responsible because of Alice Cooper. He played a very creepy homeless guy. The second half is complete and utter chaos and very catastrophic. A lot of blood is shed, and some of the most twisted things imaginable are presented on screen. Carpenter takes your deepest fears and shoves them in your face. I felt helpless when viewing this movie because I made the mistake of turning the lights off. I don't get scared very easily these days, but this one did it. It resembles Invasion of the Body Snatchers at times, but in my opinion, no Invasion of The Body Snatcher movie comes close to the sheer terror of this movie. It's a near masterpiece. My only complaint is that I felt the movie ended too abruptly. It was a bit too inconclusive for my liking, but at the same time it did make you think as to whether it was all over or not. Donald Pleasence is excellent as Father Loomis (A sly nod to his character in Halloween) Not many people can add class or depth like he does. I love the Donald! Lisa Blount is likable as the most sensible female lead in the film. Jameson Parker is dull and gives the worst performance in the film as Bryan. His chemistry with Blount is off as well. Susan Blanchard is inconsequential.until the second half. She creeped me out in a major way with that makeup, and weirdly enough she's not the scariest character in the movie! That honor goes to Anne Marie Howard. Her stoic facial expressions were terrifying. That meandering walk of hers made her even scarier. It should be mentioned among fellow horror fans everywhere as one of the all time great performances as far as scary goes. Dennis Dunn plays the comedic relief. He was funny most of the time, and surprisingly sympathetic, considering his condescending antics at times. Victor Wong is effective in his role as the professor. I felt he played off Pleasence extremely well and had some awesome scenes with him. I have no complaints about the acting, aside from Jameson Parker's bland show. Final Thoughts: I'm gonna go ahead and be brazen. I'm gonna give this movie 10 stars. Since it scared the hell out of me, it deserves it. Why? Because it's almost impossible to frighten me in this day and age. But it's also just an amazing horror film in general, full of creative ideas that translate very well on screen. It's an absolute must see. The only Carpenter film that outdoes this movie is Halloween10/10",Prince of Darkness

John Carpenter continues with this duel strength as director and composer whose musical talents bring a rare atmospheric enhancement as usual to this movie. This solid horror movie askew the typical sexual overtones and begins the movie with a rather unique extended credits cutting to beginning scenes with a resonating opening musical theme presents a confidence presentation of evil without the superficial trappings. The few weaknesses such as the ready acceptance of the religious establishment for a revisionist view of Jesus, the fascinating dream scenes that unfortunately don't seem to offer more than token subplot that can't quite contribute to the main storyline drama, and a few seemingly electronic disconnection to the outer world, keep this movie from being a completely tightly editing and written movie classic.

I can certainly understand why he didn't want to add his name as writer credit...What is Donald Pleasence and Jameson Parker doing in a movie like this?? The acting by most of the actors was really bad, and unconvincing. There are so many (unnecessary) characters just for the kill. For a Carpenter film, there were hardly any good visuals. The make-up was so bad and clearly latex suits/accessories. The script was equally bad and made very little sense.

39,sol-,"The Devil, Probably",6,6 October 2016,"Asked to investigate a giant canister of bright green fluid found in the basement of an abandoned church, a group of quantum physics students begins to suspect that the liquid may have diabolical origins in this John Carpenter horror movie. 'Prince of Darkness' is a fairly ambitious project as Carpenter attempts to mesh scientific reasoning (the Devil is referred to as some sort of anti-matter) and theology, however, the two realms of knowledge do not exactly go well hand-in-hand and much of the dialogue comes off as babble. The film has some great moments though when the characters stop talking and simply react to the bizarre things that begin to happen around them as they research and prod further into matters. In particular, the homeless folk outside begin behaving very strangely (could they be possessed?), led by Alice Cooper in a creepy performance. There is also something very Cronenberg-like to the way the liquid infects its first victim, who then transmits it to others in highly sexual ways; one of the infection sequences almost looks like it is about to turn into a lesbian love scene! The makeup special effects are quite creepy too and the film boasts a characteristically sinister, throbbing score cowritten by Carpenter himself. The film is very lacking in the character department, a humorous Dennis Dun aside, and as mentioned, the whole religion/science fusion does not really gel, but there is enough of interest here in between the chitchat. The film ends on a delightful note of uncertainty too.",Prince of Darkness

But the truth is that it looks like a milkshake of wickedness, evil concentrated. And in it lies the secret to awaken the Prince of Darkness. The movie may seem strange and very unbelievable because of these elements, but the truth is that it works very well as a horror movie. John Carpenter is a master at creating suspense and scare the audience, and he achieves one more success in this film, probably one of the least known of his consecrated career.

43,leplatypus,"Still scary on repeat, 20 years after the 1st ? (rental)",10,24 November 2013,"That was indeed the question that haunted me as my first viewing in the 90s was totally scary. In fact, if my memory is good, i watch it on a sunny afternoon as relaxed as this team of scientists and students. And then, the music, the silent threats and kills really oppressed me with the same panic that was played on screen.Now, i tried to watch on a black night and my opinion is that ... the movie is still gripping but the fear decreases with the number of viewing. I think that the movie isn't related to this effect because it just due to memory: there is a excellent proverb for that: "" once bitten, twice shy"". It's a good thing finally to feel this way because without this kind of learning, mankind would have been never got out of his cave!As i already know this dreadful church and that flashes come back slowly, the bonus of this new watching was to pay attention to new details and to use a kind of new glasses made by all the experiences i lived since the last time: Thus, i found that the basic ideas of this movie are brilliant and not used very much in horror: to choose a sacred place to hold the devil is great as it's really the last place in which you can expect fear. To expect analyze devil with technology is audacious as the failure is certain. In addition, it was cool to see that unknown or a bit familiar faces could play as good or better than the usual big names of Hollywood. So there are still great things with this movie, even if i won't make nightmares again.",Prince of Darkness

I never disliked it but it often left me flat. Not tonight. Tonight it was almost an edge-of-my-seat experience. John Carpenter is probably the only writer/director who have pulled this one off. In lesser hands, it could have ended up being kind of silly. Carpenter gets nice performances out of his (mostly) stock company cast.

The rest of the actors do what they can.The last 20 minutes of the movie truly deliver shock, terror, and even claustrophobic moments.

47,Vartiainen,Men fighting against horrors they were never meant to face,6,15 July 2020,"Prince of Darkness is a John Carpenter film, with everything that entails. In it a group of professors and students enter an abandoned church to investigate a mysterious cylinder that has been hidden there for centuries. But is all their scientific profess any match against Satan himself?It's a very typical John Carpenter film. It has spooky atmosphere, muted colours, very down to earth characters, amazing special effects, creepy set designs and its story is straight from a pulp magazine. And yet it isn't corny. Not really. Carpenter has this honesty to his films, this intensity. He really believes that he's telling a great story and that translates to the audience.That being said, the film lacks that edge some of his other films have had. It never goes downright silly, but it flirts with it. Like with the basement where the mysterious object is being kept. The whole place is covered with crucifixes. Like absolutely every single surface has them. I'm doubtful there was a crucifix left in LA once the prop people were done decorating this place.The story is also a bit all over the place. We have Satan, we have university people, we have time travel messages, we have zombies, we have mysterious green goo, we have mirror dimensions. None of these elements quite match.But, I had fun watching it. It has personality, if nothing else.",Prince of Darkness

He shows him the room the key opens in an old church containing a green substance in a large canister.

49,hellraiser7,Darkness Rising,10,8 November 2018,"This is another one of my favorite movies of all time, it's kind of also my seventh favorite film from one of my favorite movie directors ""John Carpenter"" if you can believe that; and the second in his apocalypse trilogy.One of the things I always love about his films are how each film is always creatively different, this film no doubt is a different kind of sci-fi horror film you don't see every day. This film almost looks and feels like it could have been a lost episode of ""The X-Files"" or ""Gravity Falls"" had they decided to tackle this notion (well ok ""The X-Files did have a few episodes that dealt with Satan and his demonic minions' kind of).I really love the plotline which I think is an interesting concept and almost plausible which provides a what if possible explanation on a religious system whether you really believe in it or not, it's almost like with Michael Moorcock's sci-fi book ""Behold the Man"" which was also a story that also provided a what if. It's true it seems like a wild concept, but the thing is we don't truly know what happened thousands of years ago in history, and of course there were the archeological findings of the Sumerian texts about a people called the Aunnaki which honestly made me thought twice about the faith I'm in; so who's really to say what is.But also, the plotline is kind of Lovecratian, just like in H.P.'s stories they were always about otherworldly threats but also carried a bit of an atheistic philosophy in which Lovecraft himself was, so the film sort of stays true on both matters.I like the protagonists, it's true there are two characters that are suppose to be the main leads played by Jameson Parker and Lisa Blont they do fine they serve their functions but to me their kind of the weak point of the film as both are uninteresting and two dimensional making them almost generic by their nature. It really the three characters in the film that are the true main protagonists and thankfully have more than enough screen time to be that, which was a wise choice.All three are over course John Carpenter alumni, Dennis Dun is great, it sort of looks like that actor Reggie Lee from the TV show ""Grimm"" but isn't. But his character is a lot of fun, he's just funny sort of almost a Bruce Campbell like character (Bruce Campbell in a John Carpenter film that would have been something) as he's just got a lot of humorous memorable lines some comical and some sarcastic/smart ass ones. But I really like how he reacts and expresses himself through the whole ordeal which feel like how any of us would; he really doesn't want to be there he'd rather be somewhere else and has something better in mind he'd rather be doing right now which is a feeling I can emphasize with as I feel that way whenever I stay in one place too long or just bored with whatever I'm doing right now that feels like a waste of time which most likely is. His feeling is correct, and from what happens latter he really regrets how he spent his weekend which is about to turn into a dead weekend.Victor Wong and Donald Pleasance are great as Prof. Howard Birack and Priest both have a great back and forth, both are obviously the representations of science and religion going hand and hand but at the same time in constant conflict on each other. I like how both aren't the stereotypical academic and priest architypes that are annoyingly egocentrics. Both are firm on what they believe in but their both also open-minded people as they are open to any and all possibilities in life and as we see from what they find both their beliefs are put to the test and make both ask more questions then every before.The monologues and dialogs both characters have been great, I really like everything they say because there is a lot of truth to it. From what both character say at the beginning of the film, Priest talks about the problem with disbelief and latching on to common sense making us blind to acknowledge what exists despite unseen but also Birack giving a lecture to his class about how all the things we take for granted in life aren't true and real truth and the common perception of reality isn't what we think. Despite different ideologies both are right, and really correlates with the themes in the film about our search and perception of the truth.I really love how thought provoking the film is. You might not get it all by the first watch which is why this film is one of those ones you must watch more than once to uncover more and the more I watched it, the more I understood the film. I really love how science is included, not to say science was never a part of both the sci-fi and horror genre but most of the time it was always indirect or like a shelf holder for the story.Here we really see and hear real science being applied and spoken, in a way it sort of makes the film a little educational in some of the realm of quantum physics which I've never taken at Pacific Lutheran University, but watching this film gains me some understand and sparks a little interest.But of the course the suspense/horror and music are just superb. As usual the music in Carpenter's films is great, the music in this film really has a cold chilling ominous feeling that rings true to the nature of this film; this is another one of the kinds of music I could listen to on my iPod or even a record player.The suspense is great, you are just having the icy chills from beginning to end as you just have this feeling of dread and impending doom. The pacing is great as it starts out steady but then speeds up as things begin to unravel very fast.I really like the setting, which is oppressive and creepy, despite it being a shut down church you find no sanctuary there. From the lighting, some of the seediness of the architecture, the long dark hallway which always gave me the creeps I honestly won't go down there unless I had a 12 gauge (characters in this film probably which they did).I really like some of the effects which are solid and really do add to the creepy vibe, from some good blood/gore effects, along with the big green ooze canaster where the dark prince resides which I'll admit looks like the ooze canaster from ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"", hmmmm did John Carpenter read the comic book series. I really like how they handle the ""Prince of Darkness"" character itself. The character never really comes forth till the end of the film, which is fine by me because here the dark prince is a force of evil from beginning to end, you really feel its presence as it's psychic influence is just creating an oppressive and evil atmosphere.There is a usual the feeling of isolation which is a common theme in Carpenter's films as we see in the third act the protagonists are literally on their own as no one really knows where they are, but are just stuck between a church and a hard place as the army of tranced people (in which Alice Cooper has a cameo role which is cool since I'm a fan of his music) are covering the outside, as well as those ooze zombies from inside that spray out ooze from their mouths; so either way their all fracked.Once scene that I found memorable and always chilled me is how the protagonists have these strange dreams that look like found footage (yeah this film sort of predated that sub-genre), we see the camera roughly moving on the church location and there is this voice that keeps saying ""this is not a dream"" and the camera pans to a dark figure. Despite very little revealed you already know in the back of your mind who that dark figure is, I remember thinking ""Oh crap it's Satan himself, we're all fraked.""This film really gets at the issues of the follies of both religion and science how both field never really have the whole truth, how the truth isn't always what we perceive no mater our preconceived beliefs, but most of all no matter how much knowledge we acquire over the years it doesn't make us any wiser because we still know very little about the infinite universe we occupy.
I really love this film, but word of warning it's not exactly for anyone, if you're into thought provoking sci-fi and horror then this film is worth a try. But if you're a casual sci-fi and horror and you're not down with the kind that make you think then this film may not be for you.It was always said we can never truly contain evil, because no matter how much we try to and how many times, it always finds a way out.Rating: 4 stars",Prince of Darkness
50,Captain_Couth,The Cinema of John Carpenter: The Second chapter of the Apocalyptic Trilogy.,9,20 August 2005,"Prince of Darkness (1987) was another dark and depressing film from John Carpenter. It's also the second part of his unofficial trilogy of Apocalyptic films. A group of scientists, grad students and theologians gather inside an old cathedral. In the basement of the building is a mysterious jar containing some liquefied remains. The people who were choosing for this experiment must stay the night inside the cathedral. A few of the reluctant students don't want to waste their time looking at a giant jar. A priest is concerned about what dwells inside the goo and knows that there's a certain mind link between those that were chosen.What is inside the metal and glass container? The scientists' equipment starts to blink out. A lot of strange mathematical equations begin to come from the jar. The priest knows whats inside but nobody will believe him. Outside the homeless are starting gather around the church. This mindless bunch of schizos are the type of vermin that evil attracts. What's ever inside the jar is drawing all sorts of attention. But we know one thing. It's going to be a long night for those inside the church.An hour after sunset, the entity in the container breaks free. The evil being inside has broken the seal and his using it's power to possess people. It's wants to release it's hellish father from limbo. A few people try to leave the church. But they're greeted by a mob of psycho-bums led by Alice Cooper. He impales an unlucky dude with his bicycle. Those who stay will either die a nasty death or they'll join the legion of the undead. Whenever they try to sleep during this ordeal, they receive a message from the Brotherhood of Sleep warning them about the end-of-the-world from a demonic anti-Christ near the turn-of-the-century. The survivors inside the church have no choice but to destroy the evil entity before it brings hell on earth!A handful of survivors fight their way until day break. The leader of the possessed inside the church wants to break it's ""father"" out of limbo. It needs a mirror to create a portal to the ""Other Side"". The entity finds a perfect doorway. But before they could bring this nasty creature from limbo, one of the survivors sacrifices herself to stop this being from ever seeing the light of day. Before the woman could be pulled out of limbo from certain damnation, the priest destroys the mirror, leaving her trapped on the ""far side"" forever. Earth has been saved from a Apocalyptic nightmare. No one outside the church will ever know. The bums leave, no longer under the ""Dark Master's' spell. Days later, the boyfriend of the woman who was left behind in limbo starts to have the same dream from the ""Brotherhood of Sleep"", this time an anti-Christ demonic figure can be seen emerging from the ruins, it's HER. The lonely dude looks into his own bathroom mirror and ponders about reaching into it....Another dark classic from John Carpenter. It's more of a psychological horror then a straight out gore fest. There's nothing cooler than a interesting psychological thriller. The final part of the Trilogy of the Apocalypse was made eight years later in the H.P. Lovecraft influenced IN THE MOUTH OF MADNESS.Highly recommended.",Prince of Darkness
51,lukem-52760,TRULY OUTSTANDING!!! A CARPENTER CLASSIC,10,26 April 2019,"This is one film that hardly never gets mentioned when talking about John Carpenters movies & yet it's excellent & as good as most of his now CLASSIC films.
A small ensemble cast under siege by a force of evil in a trapped location, this is perfect & Close ""Carpenter""Prince of darkness has that creepy atmosphere that carpenter is known for & it's thick with dread the whole way through & the music is excellent once again by carpenter, so his special unique touch is all over this underrated apocalyptic Horror.The big old creepy church setting in a run down part of Los Angeles is a very eerie setting & we have a fantastic ensemble cast including carpenter regulars Donald Pleasance,Victor Wong,Dennis Dun & Peter Jason & some others but these guys are well known in the Carpenter movie universe.
The Apocalyptic feel to this is very unsettling knowing the centuries old evil that could be Satan himself in the form of black slime in a huge ancient canister is scary & totally unique.
This is a carpenter classic & should be appreciated as much as Halloween or The Thing!!!
The performances are all good to excellent that being Donald Pleasance & Victor Wong both great roles.The demonic make-up fx are excellent & the Hobo zombie type folk surrounding the big church building is very scary so yeah this is one of Carpenters best films by far.Prince of darkness has received a bit bigger fan base now like ""They Live"" did but it's not up there where it should be? I like it as much as ""The Thing"" & ""The Fog"" as his ""Prince of Darkness"" is made in that eerie mould of constant dread, tension & fear.
I also think his ""Prince of Darkness"" is his most thoughtful film that mixes ""Religion"" & beliefs & Science & Time & the universe & a whole load of Topics into a terrifying Apocalyptic Horror piece.Straight away as the movie starts there's an eerie pulse of music that instantly sets the mood of fear & dread, the Atmosphere is full of doom & it hangs over this pure 80's Ensemble piece like a big dark shadow. The ensemble cast is excellent with like i mentioned The Carpenter regulars, The great & legendary Donald Pleasence as the Priest who discovers the Canister of Green goo in the abandoned Church
& the great Victor Wong (Big Trouble in little China) plays professor Howard Birack, there's also Dennis Dun also from ""Big Trouble in little China"" & the excellent character actor Peter Jason as Dr. Paul Leahy (They Live, Escape from L.A).
Lisa Blount & also the kind of ""lead"" guy is that of Jameson Parker as ""Brian"" a moustache wearing university student guy, he's basically a ""Tom Atkins"" type but not as great as that legend but he's fine here.
It's a good little cast. The look is creepy & isolated like his ""Assault on precinct 13"" as our group of scientists are basically holed up a big old Church in downtown L.A, the candlelit lighting is very effective within the church as it adds a Gothic Horror look & also a Cosy feel too.
This is a very scary supernatural Horror.
I think this is actually or could be John Carpenters ""MASTERPIECE"" it's definitely a runner up & arguably just could be!!!
""Prince of darkness"" is a superior piece of work from the Master & a stunning & intense Horror Classic.
Probably my favourite of the Master",Prince of Darkness
52,dworldeater,"Hello, I have a movie to recommend and you are going to like it!",8,9 October 2016,"John Carpenter's Prince Of Darkness is his second film in what he refers to as his apocalpse trilogy. The other two films are The Thing and In The Mouth Of Madness, the three films are not part of the same series or storyline , but all share an end of the world theme and are all made by Carpenter. Prince Of Darkness is also a return to the horror genre and low budget film making as John Carpenter was tired of dealing with big studios. He had complete creative control on this project and made a very strange, but original horror film that is very well done overall. The story is quite ambitious and crazy, combining theories from quantum mechanics and theology. Satan has been imprisoned in the basement of a Los Angeles church and when a priest dies that was part of a secret sect called The Brotherhood Of Sleep strange things start happening around the church and his successor another priest played by Donald Pleasance ask scientist (Victor Wong) for help. Wong brings in his group of scientists and students to help investigate and explain the strange phenomenon and find out that the vat of green slime was Satan imprisoned. The canister of green slime has been opened and Satan possesses people by spitting green slime in the victim's mouth, turning them into zombies and agents of Satan. Satan plans on using his human host to bring his father ( an all powerful Anti God) from a different dimension to bring about the end of civilization. The film has great ambiance accompanied with Mr. Carpenter's amazing score which really helped set the tone in this piece. The mood is dark and very creepy with satanic zombies, green slime, a lot of bugs and a cameo by shock rocker Alice Cooper as main zombie creeper. The performances are very good by an ensemble cast that includes frequent Carpenter collaborators Donald Pleasance, Dennis Dun, Victor Wong and Peter Jason. The film may be a bit much for some viewers to grasp as there is a lot of information to take in and can be better understood with multiple viewings. Prince Of Darkness is very much a thinking person's horror film and John Carpenter's nightmare vision is a very interesting and cerebral film that is very unique and very entertaining horror film.",Prince of Darkness
53,I_Ailurophile,An overlooked classic,8,17 December 2020,"'Prince of Darkness' gets neglected amidst John Carpenter's many essential classics, and that's a mistake. This is a damn good horror movie, right up there with his other films.Donald Pleasence! Victor Wong! Dennis Dun! Peter Jason! Alice Cooper! Lisa Blount! Such a fantastic cast to bring this tale to life. All the staples of Carpenter's style is here in full for a novel approach to the classic story of ancient evil: the growing unease and suspense, the ominous atmosphere, to say nothing of the body horror and other practical effects throughout.Taking a more scientific view in 1987 of such an entity far predates more recent trends in cinema of injecting as much realism as possible into genre pictures. I also appreciate the dark simplicity of the green liquid at the center of the narrative.As the movie is generally less well-known, I gather a sense that the finale and ending may not have quite as much flair or lasting power as Carpenter's other pictures. But I disagree; I think the building action in the last moments of the climax is just as thrilling as the chase across the bridge in 'Escape from New York,' or the ascent through the tower in 'They live.' And like 'The thing' or 'In the mouth of madness,' the ending is left a bit open and ambiguous, portending still more chills to the story beyond the film's conclusion.To pass on 'Prince of Darkness' is a mistake. In my opinion it's yet more evidence that Carpenter is the true master of horror in cinema.",Prince of Darkness
54,ferbs54,"""The Devil Made Me Do It!""",7,5 November 2009,"John Carpenter, having previously tackled such disparate topics as the serial killer (""Halloween""), aliens of all stripes (""Dark Star,"" ""The Thing,"" ""Starman""), ghostly pirates (""The Fog"") and a killer car (""Christine"")--not to mention the sci-fi/fantasy action/adventure film (""Escape From New York,"" ""Big Trouble In Little China"")--next tackled, in 1987's ""Prince of Darkness,"" two film genres in one: the devil triumphant and the rampaging zombie. In this picture, the living essence of Old Scratch himself is discovered in a glowing canister in the basement of a 400-year-old decrepit church, somewhere in the wilds of L.A., and when a crusty physics professor and a team of gung-ho students investigate...well, let's just say that all hell almost literally busts loose! Into this combined-genre film writer/director Carpenter manages to work in a revisionist Christian theology, a physics-based theory of evil, lots and lots of yucky insects, AND sweet Alice Cooper himself as a vicious, satanic cat's-paw. The film grows increasingly intense as the students fall one by one to demonic possession (usually by the medium of some kind of devilish projectile vomit!). It is well acted, beautifully shot, and delivers effective shocks and suspense, well abetted by a throbbing and ominous synth score (Carpenter again). By the film's end, some questions do seem to remain unresolved: How DID that satanic goop actually escape from its confinement, after 7 million years? Just what IS the meaning of those messages from the future? And just what WILL the cops think about all the bloody carnage that they find? Despite these unsatisfied plot points, ""Prince of Darkness"" deserves a higher rating than the ""Bomb"" that the wet-blanket editors at Maltinville have chosen to give it. Much higher. It is an intelligent and at times quite gripping shocker; one helluva ride!",Prince of Darkness
55,Jonny_Numb,"Satan Spits, Carpenter Scores",8,23 November 2006,"God...damn! From what orifice did John Carpenter, a director whose films seldom rise above the level of glorified B-pictures, pull the crazy, scary (and crazily scary), and genuinely apocalyptic ""Prince of Darkness""? I don't know, but it is unquestionably one of his best films.The plot centers on the last member of a religious sect, who dies with information on a long-kept secret residing in the basement of an abandoned Los Angeles church; Donald Pleasance (finishing his Wood/Lugosi-esquire collaboration with Carpenter) plays the unnamed priest who investigates, and eventually enlists the help of a local professor of metaphysics (an inspired Victor Wong) and a gaggle of college students to investigate...a large cylinder of swirling green goo. It may sound absurd in words, but Carpenter turns this unassuming villain into a character unto itself--after all, it IS the essence of Satan.Robert Rodriguez once claimed Carpenter to be such a distinctive director that you could recognize one of his films by viewing a single frame. Through the 1980s, he perfected his style to the point where it became predictable (even here, the rhythmically similar, synth-heavy score is present); in ""Prince of Darkness,"" the familiarity is misleading to those expecting a typical Carpenter production. The opening credits, which intersperse the beginnings of the film between cast and crew, sets a mood unlike any I've felt in his films; perhaps it was the score, the intelligent dialog, or that ceaselessly creepy image of a winking moon suspended above a bright sun. Carpenter's method may not be subtle, but is it ever possible to address the apocalypse with subtlety? The cast consists of a lot of less-than-knowns, but they put on a very good show, and deliver Carpenter (under the pseudonym Martin Quatermass)'s dialog with fervent conviction; in a film like this, the delivery often determines how seriously we take things, and here it comes off with a good deal of verisimilitude. Lisa Blount (""Dead & Buried""), Jameson Parker, and Dennis Dun (as a wisecracking, hilariously outspoken disbeliever) turn in the most memorable performances among the students; Wong, Pleasance, and Peter Jason (""Ghosts of Mars"") fare well as the supervising adults; and Alice Cooper has a short but seriously creepy cameo as the leader of a bunch of possessed derelicts.Carpenter's imagery through the years has ranged from the understated (the relatively goreless, in-the-shadows menace of ""Halloween"" and ""The Fog"") to the outrageous (Rob Bottin's brilliant FX in ""The Thing""). In ""Prince of Darkness,"" the director makes us squirm and chill with images as simple as worms glued to windows, beetles crawling on clothes, and--perhaps most memorably--maggots crawling around in a tin can held by a homeless woman. Factor in prophetic, shot-on-video 'dream sequences' that slowly piece together the film's closing revelation (pardon the pun), and you have all the ingredients for a good nightmare.Carpenter also taps into some modest commentary on the mid-1980s and mankind itself--the infectious green liquid that slowly turns the students to zombies (and is subsequently transmitted via spit) can be read as a parallel to AIDS, which was a fully realized fear in the public mind by '87 (additionally, one 'infected' character's flesh slowly disintegrates). And while Carpenter recycles the ""people-trapped-in-buildings-against-bad-things-outside"" scenario that has been his stock and trade since ""Assault on Precinct 13"" (1976), he adds a layer of irony to the setting--within the walls of a church, where even the most faithless are allowed refuge, our heroes are left to do battle with a Satanic houseguest (this also makes the setting that much more frightening and the impending danger far more real). Additionally, the decision to make schizophrenic derelicts hypnotized tools of the Devil was a masterstroke, as the class system has transformed the homeless into America's Boogeymen, the type of people we are loath to approach out of some ingrained (yet inexplicable), ghoulish fear.But you don't have to read anything into ""Prince of Darkness"" to get a sufficient horror charge from it. This is one of Carpenter's most challenging and intelligent works, a chilling prophecy of Satan finding his way to earth through the image of Man.7.5 out of 10",Prince of Darkness
56,TheFearmakers,John Carpenter's Touch of Evil,8,1 December 2016,"Written by Martin Quartermass, who is in fact the director, John Carpenter, his very own PRINCE OF DARKNESS has a good number of death scenes or near- deaths wherein the bodies come alive again to stalk the shadowy corridors and keep survivors at an even tighter restraint of space: And not the kind of screaming and suspenseful pandemonium that usually occurs when people die, one after the other, as the formidable antagonist, who in this case is The Devil, trapped inside what looks like a lava lamp imitating a barber shop pole full of Gatorade (which could be CHRISTINE's anti freeze): spewing deathly liquid into the mouth of, first, one of four sexy ingenues, and our personal favorite lass, serving as the most palpable killer later on, and even outshining Cooper, who remains spooky and peripheral outside, mostly unseen past the first and second act.Anyone looking for a jolting horror experience, this might not work since the spookiest moments occur in a shared dream by anyone who falls into a nap. As for the antagonist... who's spoken of a lot and only viewed within the glimpse of each quick dream... perhaps having Lucifer himself as a horror flick heavy is aiming too high for mainstream audiences, or fans of HALLOWEEN and its myriad of clones. Symbolically speaking, this particular DARKNESS is more like scanning the blueprints of a haunted house than being frightfully lost and vulnerable inside one. Alice Cooper and the homeless zombie troupe aside, the real human villain is a she, who, like Satan in many a book and film, has a human name few can remember. This is a reoccurring bit of subtle Carpenter humor: ""Have you seen Susan?"" ""Who?"" ""Susan, the Radiologist, with the glasses.""Anne Howard is the girl next door type who does wear glasses but only at first, until taking them off or getting them taken off in a very green, wet manner — then turning into a pale zombie that eventually snowballs a host of others to take care of the survivors, including an actor who was pretty much the main action-star of Carpenter's Kung Fu comedy BIG TROUBLE IN LITTLE CHINA while Kurt Russell watched in amazement... But here, Dennis Dun is horribly miscast as the sarcastic and reluctant character i.e. our token comic relief... He seems to be reading lines, and his forced glib humor doesn't elevate the chaos or allow the audience to escape the bedlam, as intended. On the plus side: It seems that no matter how many deaths or gruesome bodily-takeovers occur, the movie remains as mellow and constant as the signature synthesizer music by the director himself, providing an even-keeled, foreboding pulse that rarely speeds up, making even the most gory deaths seem completely normal, and commonplace...In this location, they are... For PRICE OF DARKNESS, according to Carpenter in a DVD/Blu Ray Commentary track with his stock actor/buddy Peter Jason... the latter who told us, personally, in a Cult Film Freak podcast, that his decision to become a crying zombie was an idea from his personal friend, actor extraordinaire David Warner (who loved Peter's interview but couldn't do one himself)... Carpenter revealed this film was actually more like Howard Hawk's THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD than his own THE THING in that much of the story has a group of scientists roaming from one room into another...The differences between both THING flicks (of the 50's and 80's) are many, but there's one thing that makes DARKNESS superior to Hawks's science fiction chiller: the number of people dwindle as the film progresses, which means things actually occur in-between, and while the killings aren't extremely scary, there's a palpable sense of dread from the very on-set: cutting from a darkened corridor to the shiny exterior of U.S.C. where existential Philosophy professor Victor Wong teaches his class something about what's actual and what isn't... a theory he alters while aiding the Priest... And where cinematic Christianity and/or Catholicism usually has a temperamental knee-jerk reaction against scientific theories, because of the connection between our two polar opposite but equally wise old-timers, both religion and science is neatly hybrid, which makes Carpenter's script actually quite deep, thought-provoking, and refreshingly open-minded...But for those who stray from movies that may as well be Christian or Faith-based since, after-all, if centering on the Devil there must be a hero in God and Jesus Christ, don't fret: According to a scroll discovered inside the church, Christ was more of a paranormal researcher than a messiah, and, with an extra terrestrial origin, he was sent to Earth to, along with his disciples, simply keep Old Scratch at bay... So that's the backstory, and what a controversial prequel Jesus Christ: GHOST HUNTER would have been. But in all seriousness, this lends a touch of science-fiction to the ancient-curse-horror element...Which fits Carpenter's wheelhouse, and this is definitely his labor of love that's fitfully murky, creepy and remains entertaining from beginning to end despite a few Second Act scenes that drag a bit: And towards the conclusion we go back to one of John's first movies — his own personal Modern-Urban-Western that he also wrote himself, titled ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13 about a group of survivors trapped within a particular location and, because of nefarious elements outside (gang members trying to enter a closed-down but sparsely occupied police station), they can't get out: Herein, instead of gun-wielding hoods there's Satan controlling a different kind of zombie altogether, which leads to another realization: While maybe not that original a body count horror since it's fairly obvious, judging by the personalities, who will buy the farm — for a Zombie flick, PRINCE OF DARKNESS is a morbid, meticulous and contained one of a kind treat.

57,truemythmedia,"Great Concept, Okay Execution",6,1 October 2019,"The more I see of John Carpenter's films the more convince I am that he is absolutely amazing at coming up with great concepts for horror movies, and he is mostly successful in transferring those ideas from his brain to the screen. ""Prince of Darkness"" is a prime example of this quality. The idea of a mysterious cylinder that contains a bizarre and so potentially dangerous unknown substance that the Vatican itself knows of its existence and wants to keep it quiet feels like something out of a Lovecraft short story.Within the first twenty minutes of this movie, I was wondering why I'd never heard this film touted as one of Carpenter's best; the set up was great, the pacing (in act one) moves at a pretty quick clip, and it even had some pretty decent actors to make up for the others who didn't give great performances. I thought I was in for a real treat... and then act two came and the film started dragging... and then some rather sexist characters started to show up... and then by the end of act two, when the pacing was still a bit slow and the less-talented actors started to eat up most of the screen time I knew why I hadn't really heard much about this movie before: it's not that great, but it does have some really redemptive scenes, which is why I chose to give this movie a 3/5 and nothing lower.",Prince of Darkness
58,Samiam3,Prince of Mediocrity,5,5 October 2009,"After In The Mouth of Madness, Prince of Darkness makes the least sense of all Carpenter's movies. However, while In the Mouth of Madness was intentionally confusing so as to allow multiple interpretations, this one feels simply confused and is frequently lifeless. I'm sure there are many viewers out there who would say it is the other way around with these two films, but that is the beauty of movie viewing, we all have our different opinions.I mentioned once that John Carpenter has his ups and downs. Sometimes he is a skilled visual storyteller, and sometimes he is klutz. Prince of Darkness is a case of the latter. While there are times when it manages to perk your interest, the problem is very clear to me, nobody has any idea of what they are trying to do, especially Carpenter. Among the problems, the story is poorly explained and executed, the characters are about as dimensional and understandable as stick figures, and a lot of the dialogue is silly and irrelevant to the story. Sometimes Prince of Darkness feels like more of a physics lesson than a ghost hunting picture. Prince of Darkness also suffers from the 'anti-climactic' syndrome. The last twenty minutes were clearly designed as nothing more ambitious than an excuse to use some moderately nifty visual effects. As a whole Prince of Darkness is just a sting of mixed up events set against with a thick Carpenter atmosphere with a few creepy visuals, but hardly enough for me to recommend.Once again Carpenter brings back Donald Pleasance . He plays another priest who hires locally renowned physics professor Howard Birack to help him investigate a phenomenon locked in a church basement. The professor brings his students along, most of whom are suspicious and unwilling until he tells them it will boost their grades. At the back of a large candle lit chamber is a glass canister containing a fluid of supreme evil power. One by one, this power starts processing the hapless individuals who have set up a lab in the church to study and motioner. What is this power that is slowly becoming unleashed? and who is controlling it? Is it a god? a demon, a being from another dimension. Our heroes must find out fast.If there is one thing memorable about Prince of Darkness it would be the score. John Carpenter does his own music, and he is an exceptional synthesist. Although most of his scores sound the same, this one is a bit more distinctive and emphasized, especially during the last half hour.Yet this alone is no reason to see the movie. Just buy the soundtrack instead. As for Prince of Darkness, I say leave it in the Darkness and try another Carpenter.",Prince of Darkness
59,davidmvining,Terror and Craftsmanship,7,14 September 2021,"John Carpenter was going to a dark place. It's not really the subject matter, though. While Prince of Darkness is a bit more apocalyptic than some of his other offerings, it's obvious that it was the commercial failure of Big Trouble in Little China that did something to Carpenter's view of the world. This and his next film, They Live, are dark, angry films that take some of his earlier ideas and motifs about the nature of evil and turn them up to eleven. He had done good, making successful and well regarded films in Christine and Starman after the failure of The Thing, and Big Trouble in Little China was his effort to reassert his own voice in a fun adventure movie made with his pals. With another major failure in his career, he turns around and makes a movie about how neither religion nor science can explain true evil. I don't want to armchair psychologist the guy, but I suspect there may be a connection.A priest (Donald Pleasence) finds a mysterious box that contains a key in the hands of a recently deceased priest. The key goes to a secret chamber in the basement of a church that has stood there for hundreds of years. He brings in an old friend, Professor Birack (Victor Wong), a quantum physicist, to investigate what's been hiding under the church. Birack organizes a large investigation with his own graduate students as well as those of some other departments. Chief among these students are Brian (Jameson Parker), Catherine (Lisa Blount), and Walter (Dennis Dun), all physicists who are friends while Brian and Catherine are nascent lovers. The largest issue with the film overall is the characters. Carpenter was far more interested in the philosophical questions around the nature of evil. His characters here aren't even vehicles for these questions. Really there's an uneasy combination of Carpenter's earlier efforts to ape Howard Hawks' later style and this question at the heart of the film.Where the movie really shines is in its sense of impending horror. From the beginning, there's this foreboding that permeates the film and it get highlighted early by the roving homeless that remain outside the church as the students and professors arrive for their night of study. Led by Alice Cooper in his white face makeup, their presence starts as just a simple uneasy reality that they all try to ignore.The church itself is hiding a chamber underneath with a cylindrical container that contains an ever-swirling green liquid. Initial review shows that the container can only be opened from the inside. There's also a book alongside it in different ancient languages that needs translation. The group begins their research and more weird things begin to go down. All while this is going on, the priest and Birack have the central conversation about how evil could be omnipresent from a quantum mechanics point of view, and it's easy to get the impression that Carpenter built up the entire script around that one conversation.What I like best about the film is the building sense of unease around the evil leaking out. The evil is formless and without explanation (a rather common concept of evil from Carpenter). I read Roger Ebert's review of the film, and he actually bemoaned the physical embodiment of evil here, and I think he misread it. The green swirling liquid isn't meant to be threatening itself. It's supposed to be a placeholder for the ideas that the priest and Birack are talking about. The real terror is how the evil takes over everyone, and that could be stronger with a stronger base of characters to terrorize. This movie could use another rewrite pass to beef up the characters, for sure, but I think the craft that goes into the eerie sense of ever-increasing terror works remarkably well.The movie, though, does descend into pure horror movie convention by the end, and I don't think it really fulfills the promise of the ideas at the center of that conversation between the priest and Birack. I don't think Carpenter really figured out how to integrate it all, and he probably rushed himself into production to take advantage of his carte-blanche offer from Alive Films.That being said, though, the final conventional horror elements are effective enough to work on their own. There are some great visual ideas involving a mirror (that I would be surprised if the special effects team of Stargate hadn't been influenced by) that are executed really well and often very prettily in an almost horrifying way.It's not one of Carpenter's best films, but Prince of Darkness is a testament to Carpenter the director over Carpenter the writer. He took a script that honestly needed more work, and he made the absolute most of it in terms of production. While the characters tend to be thin, he manages the right kind of unease and panic and even terror from his acting troupe. The movie often simply looks great, and his wallpaper musical score helps establish the mood very effectively. I have a real soft spot for Prince of Darkness.",Prince of Darkness
60,ctomvelu1,Low-budget thriller,6,20 November 2012,"Larry Franco and John Carpenter concocted this low-budget supernatural thriller about a mysterious liquid in a glass cylinder that apparently contains the essence of the son of the one, true Devil. The cylinder has been guarded by priests for centuries, and a new priest is put in charge when the film opens. The priest enlists the aid of some university folks to study the thing, and as soon as they start, the swirling green liquid begins to exert an influence and turns several of them into its undead slaves. Limited special effects with a few scares and way too much talking. Not one of Carpenter's best, but worth a look. For Carpenter fans, you'll notice thematic elements similar to his ""The Thing."" Ignore the loud, cheap musical score'. While this movie is classified as a horror flick, it is not your conventional horror picture. It also could be loosely classifieds as sci-fi, due to a hazy transmission from the future warning the scientists about what will happen, and which comes to them in their dreams. I'm not sure why Franco and Carpenter felt the need to add this element, as it slows down the action quite a bit and serves no real purpose except to confuse. A couple of gory death scenes notch this Grade B effort into ""R"" territory. Good old Donald Pleasence stars as the priest. He could just as easily be playing Doc Loomis from the ""Halloween"" flicks.",Prince of Darkness

62,denis888,Boring and Bland,1,31 March 2014,"John Carpernter? A horror flick? Alice Cooper as one of the devilish fiends? A typical 80's movie, with horrible hairdos, bad effects, typical music, laughable make-up, very bad light work and heavily predictable script? Bingo, you've got it all here. No, but seriously, this is utterly silly, this leaden ball of a movie, never good and never warm. The feeling is that of a total yawning boredom and mockery. Yup, you know every step the story takes. One thing for sure, the film does not display a single hint of sympathy to any of the heroes, or even the main ones. It is cold, almost senseless film, very bland, and what is also clear, very badly performed. The dialogs are very simple, and often the lines are delivered in a very naive, almost amateur style, very exaggerated and very insincerely. This is especially obvious in women's parts, as well as some quasi-religious style. The so-called Good Guys Fight Satan films are at most, pathetic. I am a very serious in my faith believer, but such movies serve badly and do a real bad image. This one is no exception, it drags, it is boring and never really interesting",Prince of Darkness

(R)John Carpenter's worst film has a plot that defies description, but here goes: With swarming insects and homeless zombies waiting outside, an old priest (Pleasence) working for a secret Catholic sect called the ""Brotherhood of Sleep,"" a teacher (Wong), and a bunch of physics students hole up in a rundown church to study a canister containing liquid Antichrist, end up just standing around talking claptrap, staring at computer screens, dreaming of infernal video transmissions sent from the future, and getting Gatorade sprayed into their mouths. Bizarre but fatally uninvolving; no scares to speak of, but in their place, a few disbelieving laughs.

64,Muhammad_Rafeeq,American (A+ Movie) My Ratings 8.5 /10,8,30 May 2021,"Carpenter's masterpiece.Carpenters most underrated and overlooked film. Master of thrills with minimal effects. You don't need crazy visuals but can do more with eerie slow content to creep someone out. This film is perfect example of Carpenters career work, constantly straddling the line of genius through kitsch. Sometimes he went too far and fell over the line into the absurd, but when he got it just right, you got something great. This should be more widely viewed as great. There is something very intriguing about this films comparison and attempt to ground the metaphysical ideas of myth and beliefs of good vs evil within the scientific realm of quantum physics.

66,capkronos,"Great music, some atmosphere, some creeps.",4,10 April 2007,"A mostly muddled, wrong-headed, incoherent horror brew from a man who should know better; John Carpenter, who also scripted, co-produced and did the (excellent) score. Just as I always suspected, the spirit of Satan himself is actually being kept in the basement of an abandoned Los Angeles church, imprisoned inside a giant lava lamp that looks like it was filled by Slimer from GHOSTBUSTERS. Frenzied priest Donald Pleasence notices some weird stuff is afoot and contacts a college professor (Victor Wong), who puts together a team of multi-ethnic brainiacs (biochemists, radiologists, computer experts, mathematicians, theologists and various other scientist types) to investigate. When some ancient text is decoded, it uncovers that the gunk is actually the liquefied remains of the devil himself, put there by his own father seven million years ago. Or something. The container springs a leak, spits out a stream of slime into a young woman's mouth and then the fun and games begin as people trapped inside the old church are killed off (or possessed) one by one. People share nightmares (actually video transmissions from the future?!), others commit suicide, a black zombie sings ""Amazing Grace,"" a head falls off, a neck is cracked, a throat is slashed, demonic messages come across a computer screen, there's an infestation of bugs, worms and maggots and a cult of schizophrenic street people lurking the alleyways and killing off anyone who tries to leave.If nothing else, this is a fairly ambitious effort and it's somewhat fun to listen to the science, theory and speculation heaved at us, but many viewers will find it needlessly cluttered, excessively talky and/or just not worth the effort. The production values are decent, but the acting and dialogue are quite awful at times and the ending is just plain abysmal. I guess one high point is when rocker Alice Cooper (as the pale-faced leader of the killer bums) impales a nerd with a bicycle. John Carpenter (who would in my eyes complete redeem himself the very next year with the excellent sci-fi political paranoia piece THEY LIVE) used the alias ""Martin Quatermass"" for the script; which is in reference to the Nigel Kneale character Prof. Bernard Quatermass.

Understanding the story requires at least a few viewings since the script isn't exactly aimed at the teen crowd used to Scream and the likes. Carpenter generates a scary mood and atmosphere thanks to some rock solid set pieces and a really terrific music score.

68,phubbs,Prince of Darkness,6,17 November 2013,"Another minor horror flick from Carpenter that has gained cult status over the years. This is actually the first time seeing this film for me and like other Carpenter horrors I found it familiar, not really scary, but nicely creepy with something to think about after.I was surprised how similar the plot is to his other films, a group of people stuck inside a building, trapped, fighting against an evil force. A few of Carpenters films follow these sorts of themes, always fighting an evil supernatural force or gangs of zombie-like bad guys. You can tell its Carpenter a mile away although that's not a bad thing, its always pretty comforting to see his recognisable visual style from way back.I'm sure you all know what I mean, the filming in widescreen/anamorphic, stark lighting contrasts, his now legendary synthesized musical scores, hand-held cam/steadicam, the fact you never really see the evil the good guys are fighting that much, plots with hidden meaning, strong individual lone characters, opened ended finales on occasions etc...Everything is present and correct in this horror tale and its enjoyable to see. Alongside all of that the cast are mostly recognisable too, hot off the heels of 'Big Trouble' Dennis Dun and Victor Wong are cast again, Pleasence is back as another lone force of good to try and stop the force of evil and character actor Peter Jason pops up again here with a meatier role. To be honest I would say that is the one problem with the film, its too familiar from Carpenter. The plot is bordering on his other works, he uses many of the same actors again when they don't really fit the bill (Dun and Wong here) and it kinda looks and sounds the same as his other works too. The score could easily be from any of his films frankly, its good and atmospheric but you could stick it anywhere, any one of his films. In all honesty this film is virtually 'Assault on Precinct 13' but with possessed people instead of criminals.The devil is never mentioned I believe, but I'm assuming the 'father' was suppose to be the devil? and the dreams of the future are showing this evil force to have taken over the world?? hence the warning in the dream I think. Not too sure how this evil became trapped within the cylinder, or how it was placed into the basement of this church, or where the evil actually comes from originally and its goal etc...but lets just overlook that a bit shall we.That said I did enjoy the film and I thought the finale was a good thinker, a bit creepy and dark, wraps up quick and open ended...nice. Makeup and special effects are decent and created with thought, the film has a nice spooky pending doom vibe about it and the story is interesting if a little bland. Not quite as good as other Carpenter tales but still solid.6/10",Prince of Darkness

70,ivo-cobra8,An absolutely Carpenter's apocalypse supernatural classic!,10,10 November 2015,"Prince of Darkness (1987) is John Carpenter underrated absolutely apocalypse classic supernatural horror flick! I know I should choose The Fog above Prince of Darkness but after watching this film for the first time. I absolutely love it so damn much. It is actually about an apocalypse that means the end of the world. A group of college students with a priest and a college professor finds a mysterious cylinder in a deserted church. If opened, it could mean the end of the world. It containing a swirling green liquid that spits in the students and makes them possessed by the entity, which uses them against the others. The fight for survival and rescue has begun. Starring: Donald Pleasence from Halloween (1978), Escape from New York (1981) Victor Wong and Dennis Dun from Big Trouble in Little China (1986) Jameson Parker from Simon & Simon (1981 - 1995) and Thom Bray from Riptide (1984 - 1986). I love this film to death alongside with The Thing (1982) is the second installment in what Carpenter calls his ""Apocalypse Trilogy"", which began with The Thing (1982).It is one of my all time favorite supernatural horror flick from the 80's. I got it now, why is underrated you have to be very smart about it. I always can enjoy this film from John Carpenter and it is a classic film for me! A lot of people don't understand this movie but I love it and the soundtrack is amazing. The special effect this horror film had on young teenagers (14 minus), they were truly scared. It really worked and it had some interesting ideas. Lisa Blount was so beautiful in here and she was so outstanding her role as Catherine Danforth! This movie is truly amazing!!!! I am so glad that Victor Wong and Donald Pleasence return in the John Carpenter horror film. The both worked in the past 70's and 80's with John Carpenter on his awesome horror film Halloween (1978) and Big Trouble in Little China (1986). They are both classic films, just I don't like Halloween (1978) I am probably the only who hate this film, but in to Prince of Darkness I can get too, I just love this film to death!!!!The visual after Catherine (Lisa Blunt) pushes the possessed Kelly through the mirror of the light fading out as she falls into darkness is stunning and unforgettable. Lisa Blunt kicks ass in this movie!!!!!!! I just love to death how Catherine sacrifice her self to prevent apocalypse in our world, that is so outstanding! Lisa Blount did the most outstanding performance in this movie I just love her so much, movies that are pure crap are getting Oscar nominates, this movie did not got nothing, Lisa Blount is awesome!!!! RIP to Donald Pleasence, Victor Wong, and Lisa Blount. May should all rest in peace! This movie has a real story to it and is not a gore for the sake of gore movie or a hack and slash movie. John Carpenter was great in the 80s. He did a great job directing this movie along side with The Fog (1980) I think this movie is his masterpiece. I like the artwork on the soundtrack album. Very creepy it is. Sorta like a face melting effect like in the movie The Thing. The voice on the soundtrack from the end of this movie still gives me chills. It's one of the best bits is horror history. One thing I noticed about Carpenter's Apocalypse Trilogy is a running theme throughout--the fear of infection. In the Thing, it was fear of touching the monster and having your body converted to it. In Prince of Darkness it was the scientists infecting each other with bodily fluids, and in In the Mouth of Madness, it was fear of Sutter Cane's book being widely spread throughout the world, infecting those who read it with madness. It's interesting that this movie trilogy started up about the same time as AIDs was discovered. There was a huge panic about the disease being spread by blood and other fluids and it would have been foremost in the public mind. No doubt it inspired Carpenter a bit. The film isn't fast paced, but it's not slow either, gradually building tension to the very end that's peppered with a mild ""scares"" throughout to assist. There are enough twists and turns to maintain an edge to the very end, with one final twist. The movie's entirely different concept of Good and Evil is developed in a very unique and unusual manner, while maintaining excellent credibility. Visual and Special effects along with the stunt work are done quite well, surprisingly so given the film's budget. There is some graphic blood and gore, and it's very definitely ""R"" rated, but it's not as much by contemporary hard-core horror film standards (e.g. Saw, Hostel, or The Crazies remake). Carpenter makes use of some very creepy and revolting effects in lieu of it. Overall, it's an excellent supernatural horror thriller and IMHO it's one of Carpenter's better films. Master of horror John Carpenter (Halloween, The Thing) directs this terrifying battle between humankind and ultimate evil. It is one of my favorite John Carpenter best films! I am giving this movie 10/10 because this movie deserves it and it doesn't need to be hated for it.",Prince of Darkness
71,Falconeer,Rot Gut Carpenter,3,11 June 2019,"Dazzled by all the praise heaped upon this ""heap,"" I sought out ""Prince of Darkness,"" and am both astounded and bewildered that people think this piece of mediocre drivel is anything more than just that.
So much wrong here, from the unappealing, slightly past-their-prime casting choices, to the horrid acting, to the flat, ugly cinematography. Yes, even though filmed with the very wide angle lens, Carpenter still manages to make every scene utterly underwhelming, with the exceptions of the scenes with the green jar of goo that is supposed to be Lucifer In Liquid form. The Evil One starts to possess a bunch of 40 somethings who are acting like high school kids, by shooting this putrid liquid into their mouths. Then the possessed ones spit into each others mouths and also come under the influence of Satan. Then people start to die. It was a relief to see this cast of unappealing morons die. This is such tired, over treaded territory, presented with zero imagination. We also have Donald Pleasance playing the EXACT SAME character he played in ""Halloween."" He stalks around muttering about the evil of the Dark Prince exactly the way he stalked around muttering about the evil of Michael Myers. Unfortunately that is where the similarities between the two films end, because POD doesn't have the grace and visual beauty of ""Halloween,"" and resembles more something made for a direct-to-video market. There are some fascinating films out there, that deal with similar subject matter, like ""Lucifer Rising,"" and ""Rosemary's Baby."" Those are great films; this one is not. Sorry fans, but the Emperor is not wearing any clothes, in fact he's bare-assed naked.

The result was this and it could have hardly been better. The infamous eerie music makes an especially profound effect in this film, which admittedly starts slow, but when it takes of it takes all of your nerves with it.Unlike many horror popular films this film focuses very heavily on conversation. Atmosphere is of course put first, but the dialog is very interesting and makes for a film that is frightening on a thinking level. There are a well timed moments of violence, but it is on a intellectual level where this film scares the crap out of you. Carpenter must have done a good amount of research as the characters try to use various scientific concepts and terms to describe what they are slowly falling victim to. The dialog very heavily resembles H.P. Lovecraft's writing, who was unrelenting in providing the rational and thought-out narration of his protagonist. One can bet that it is this element that made it necessary for this film to be made independently.

While some viewers will enjoy the film's Gothic ambiance and stylish cinematography, others will be irritated by the slow pace and meandering plot line, which offers a purely scientific rationale for its plethora of 'supernatural' horrors (shades of QUATERMASS AND THE PIT!). The demonic villain at the heart of Carpenter's baffling screenplay - which appears to be Satan himself, though no one actually says as much - is rooted squarely within the realms of quantum physics, and while that particular strand of science is ripe for cinematic exploitation, it also requires a degree of concentration (by scriptwriters and viewers alike) which this kind of routine potboiler simply doesn't invite.Scenes begin and end in haphazard fashion, suggesting heavy post-production cutting, and while the actors are all experienced players, they don't have a lot to work with: Parker's budding attraction to Blount is so poorly conceived and executed that it fails to generate the intended emotional payoff during the tragic/horrific finale. For all its drawbacks, however, the film deserves credit for trying a new approach to old material, and Carpenter manages to generate a handful of truly startling images (Blount's 'death scene', for example, is one of the most haunting and beautiful in this director's entire filmography, and makes impressive use of the wide Panavision frame), but overall, the movie is weakened by unfocused scriptwork and a lack of narrative momentum. Alice Cooper appears briefly as a murderous vagrant.",Prince of Darkness

The two must find a way to overcome their differences in beliefs in order to save the world from the coming apocalypse. A horde of possessed homeless people and their associates stand in their way. ""Prince of Darkness"" dares to tread in dangerous territory. Director/Writer John Carpenter (penning the script under the pseudonym Martin Quartermass) blends together science and religion, knowing full well this is sure to offend zealots on both sides of the fence. It's no surprise the movie didn't garner the sort of widespread notoriety and acclaim Carpenter's ""Halloween"" did. Things tend to get uncomfortable when Christians and atheists compare and contrast the Bible with theoretical physics and atomic theory.As a Christian myself, I find the subject matter of ""Prince of Darkness"" interesting yet flawed. I still think it's a lot of scientific hooey and mumbo-jumbo, but appreciate the fact that Carpenter's trying something outside of the box. Most Christians will no doubt be offended by some of the concepts presented in the film.I hadn't seen ""Prince of Darkness"" in probably 20 years when I popped it into my Blu-ray player. There was a lot more moving around than I remembered. For some reason, I thought most of the action occurred in the main room where the container of liquid evil is kept. In fact, quite a bit of the film takes place in different parts of the abandoned church and outside. It was much better than I recalled it being.Carpenter brings along Donald Pleasance to add that bit of class and professionalism the actor is known for. He plays the priest who will do anything he has to in order to keep the evil at bay and avoid the apocalypse. Alice Cooper portrays the leader of a possessed horde of homeless people who have gathered outside the church in anticipation of the coming of the Anti-God. Jameson Parker (""Simon & Simon"") and Victor Wong (""Big Trouble in Little China"") round out the cast.""Prince of Darkness"" is rated R for graphic violence, language, and adult situations. Strangely for horror movies of the 1980s, there's no nudity to be found. Anyone who grew up watching genre films through that decade knows exactly what I'm talking about. There had to be at least one nude scene to make it a legitimate horror movie.""Prince of Darkness"" is an essential piece for any horror aficionado's home entertainment library.

80,harryplinkett14,Not one of Carpenter's best,3,19 January 2019,"What a mess. What is this thing? It's like three different films mixed into one. It even has enough protagonists for three separate films. If anything proves that less is more, it's this film. There is too much of everything here, and it ruins it all. Is it a philosophical film about science and faith? Is it a film about zombies? Is it about possession? A slasher? A monster film? A film about demons? A psychological horror? It's like Carpenter just kept piling up plot elements at random, creating a film that has absolutely no coherence whatsoever. Even the tone is weird at times. It's just a total mess. And the ending is goofy and disappointing. It's just not worth it. Carpenter's best movies are those that remain focused and keep things simple: Halloween and The Thing. When plot becomes convoluted and the antagonists complex and not clearly defined, his films lose much of their impact. The Fog is another example of this.",Prince of Darkness

Having said that, do try to keep in mind that we are still talking about Carpenter, and that it shouldn't be taken too seriously. Still, you have to give it to the man. Even if everything he did from late 90-s was worse with every next movie, he still managed to keep the art of at least filming the movie right, if not completely making it right. ""Prince of Darkness"" is still, on which I am very grateful, a good movie. From the story to the pacing and atmosphere and music; it's Carpenter through and through. We could have survived without jump scares, but I guess old John was afraid of not going with the flow of the market or something and it's OK. Movie won't make you piss your pants, but it has a creepy atmosphere. Oh, and it has Alice Cooper. Yeah. Talk about cool. I give it 7.5/10!

The music is very eighties but that doesn't bother me! It has a good solid sound mix that I couldn't complain about! This starts a little slow but it really takes off to be an intense and brutally scary movie. This truly is scary with some solid jumps and a petrifying theme! There are a lot of characters and that helps to keep the pace moving at top speed. It is reminiscent of Halloween (1978) but different and scarier due to the themes raised. The story is told really well and hints at many powers that are way above us morals. Stunning horror that doesn't fail to scare and exhilarate.,Prince of Darkness

The film is written by John Carpenter using another Martin Quatermass.The plot of the film sees a Priest (Played by Donald Pleasence) discovering a chest that belonged to another Priest, in it he finds a key and unlocking the door in the church he discovers something in the basement, a cylinder containing a mysterious green liquid that's been growing through the ages, he asks the help of a Scientist to take a look of it and with his Students and colleges they examine the cylinder and decipher the text, the Earth is also acting strange with the ants gathering and worms showing from nowhere, homeless people are also acting weird and grouping in pairs near the church (The leader played by singer Alice Cooper). Everyone inside the church are having a mysterious dream of the church with a shadowy figure appearing from it, these aren't normal dreams they're messages being sent from the future. The liquid is growing stronger as if it's alive and soon some seeps out and posses one of them, one of the people leaves but gets killed by the homeless people outside. Soon the possessed worker goes and shoots some of the liquid out of her mouth into another person, another man goes outside but gets attacked by the people outside. The possessed people soon start to attack the other possessing anyone in their way and soon with the cylinder it opens and the liquid goes inside one of them, then inside her it grows taking over the body since the liquid contains the Devil's son and once his taken over the body he's going to bring his father into our world through the mirror , with the homeless people outside and the possessed zombie like people inside the remaining people have to try and stop the Devil's son from bringing the Devil through the mirror otherwise the end of the world will begin.John Carpenter's Prince of Darkness starts off a little bit slow but it soon picks up the pace with some very chilling scenes and should be seen. 10/10",Prince of Darkness
85,PyrolyticCarbon,"Unnerving tension, a film that makes you believe things just can't end well.",9,22 January 2003,"I had been a fan of this film for a long time, and since viewing it initially I had forgotten why. I remembered the brooding tension throughout and the foreboding, there were also a couple of scenes which my memory served me as being quite cheesy, and one scene in particular that surprised me by how much it totally creeped me out, I remember it to this day. So, it was with great excitement I watched the DVD version, and relived the horror. Carpenter can be a complete genius at times, and this movie proves it outright. The cast are excellently picked, and although slightly dated, and indeed cheesy, in places, the feelings I had before were pouring out of the screen at me. From the opening scene you confused, slightly out of place, but things become all to apparent when the main location of the film is reached. The foreboding, creeping terror is brought into your mind early on, and it's almost impossible to forget throughout. With scenes to continually show you things are going wildly wrong, and yet not to give you a clear purpose or conclusion is fantastically engineered. One of the best things about this movie is that you genuinely have no idea what is going to happen, and even watching it again the most amazing feeling of believing that these people, and the world, are just not going to make it is prevalent. I think that sums up the genius of this movie for me, the director, writers and actors have managed to convince you that things are not going to work out, there's just no way, it's almost a shame when the darkness is shown, but it never breaks your mood. Oh, and that one scene that creeped me out before is pure genius, for some reason, and I cannot put my finger on it, it works and works again. There's something so wrong about it and so unnervingWell, allow me to let you watch the movie",Prince of Darkness

87,skybrick736,Prince of Darkness (8/10),8,9 July 2015,"When a director consistently puts out a variety of unique and high-caliber films, it puts them up there as one of the greats. John Carpenter has done that for the horror genre and I, for one, hold him in such a high regard, that in my eyes, he's the best horror director, period. I say this because even after the cult-classics, Halloween, The Thing, The Fog, John managed to pull off another excellent horror movie in, Prince of Darkness. Prince of Darkness combines the aspects of being intelligent and creepy; together those two attributes left the viewers with a thought-provoking horror film. The dream sequence, with a shaky hand-held was well before its time and is sort of the highlight of the film. The story is extremely well-written and not corny at all, for being a mystical idea about religion. The cast is alright, even with Donald Pleasance being outstanding; I thought casting could have been a bit better. Perhaps, Tom Atkins as the lead or a few less members of Big Trouble in Little China would have done it. The special effects are also rather surprising for the time period, even though the green blob is slightly annoying, I didn't find it ruining scenes. This is probably up there as being one of the ""scariest"" movies, (on my list) based on the soundtrack, hopeless atmosphere and having one of the most chilling ending scenes ever.",Prince of Darkness

It had elements of darkness, horror and tense, but it failed to have it's impact. There are some good tense scenes but most of the time, it's too much normal movie.If we talk about performances, none of them gave a worthy performance. Direction by John Carpenter was weak. It thought it would be just like his other movies such as Halloween and The Thing but no. I didn't find any problem with the pacing. The main problem was with too much simple story and it's too much simple execution.Overall, the movie is a normal one.

89,jayjaycee,Didn't raise the hell it could have raised,6,14 October 2020,"""Prince Of Darkness"" is a 1987 horror film directed by John Carpenter starring Donald Pleasence and Jameson Parker.
⚪
All in all, the master of horror's late eighties opus intelligently depicts what would happen if scientists are assigned to examine the arrival of the antichrist, but unlike other works of the iconic director, the plot of this basically fascinating movie is untypically shallow, the suspense remains on the same low level throughout the entire runtime and there is nothing outstandingly horrendous to consider it a terrifying horror film, and even if it sprays the famous, typical, score driven Carpenter flair, it doesn't match what he has done in the past in the slightest and thus remains a partially chilling but uneventful, way too tame spook that doesn't raise hell at all.
⚪
The thirteenth day was spent with the second of many Carpenter films of this Spooktober season, and as far as I can judge it, it is by far my least favourite of his films on this year's list. I knew what I was letting myself in on, I mean, more than a few films of the iconic director received a high rating from me, and hence I knew that there would be at least something to enjoy. In case of this film, the negative aspects surprisingly overweigh, though. Carpenter assembled a cast of mostly familiar faces, Donald Pleasence, Victor Wong and Dennis Dun, to name a few, to enact his vision of what would happen if scientists deal with the upcoming arrival of the son of Satan himself. It is basically a chilling and, most importantly, sophisticated premise and I thought of the director to be capable of creating something remarkable, as he has done multiple times in the past, but shockingly, it isn't the case with this one. I don't know if he has used the pseudonym ""Martin Quatermass"" in order to explore new writing styles and save his reputation in case of a fiasco, but this film strangely doesn't feel like it has been written by the man who has brought us ""Halloween"" and ""The Thing"" at all. It is completely unbalanced, uneventful and doesn't do anything but creating any form of suspense. Seriously, the first half an hour leaves you totally clueless and confronts you with a bunch of random characters. No real introduction, no indication to what the film is about, just nothing. I don't want to say that a film should be giving away all of its details in the first minutes, but when the film's exposition literally runs for a third of the films entire runtime, you know something is off. I mean, even the characters remark on several occasions that they have absolutely no idea about what is going on. After a time it its becoming clearer that the experts, mostly biologist, physicist, mathematicians and philologist, should unravel the secret behind the mysterious cylinder that is located in the basement of an abandoned church. The thing is, even after it is obvious what it wants to show, it doesn't become any better. In a manner that strongly reminded me of the nineteen-eighty-two extra-terrestrial terror fest, gradually more people are brainwashed by the evil force and, aside from helping it coming to life, aid killing the remaining humans. What shocked me the most though, is that this film is surprisingly lacking the brutality of the other films of the director. Menacingly staring street people (legendary musician Alice Cooper being one of them), close-up shots of worms and maggots as well as puddle squirting into people's mouths are probably the only elements that can be described as ""scary"", because aside from that, nothing outrageous really happens. Okay, maybe the dude that dissolves into cockroaches can be mentioned at that point as well, but that's it. No gore, no extreme blood and gross practical effects, just this. Furthermore, aside from the absence of terrifying visuals, the film doesn't do anything about gradually creating more suspense either. Seriously, this is the first Carpenter film where the suspension curve remains on the same basic level throughout its entire runtime. I couldn't even tell you about one specific scene that burned itself into my mind. Retrospectively, it is even more fascinating to see that barely nothing happens. It literally feels like as if it has been only two scenes: the way too stretched exposition and the final arrival of the antichrist, and nothing in between. There were many scenes in which the characters blabber about in fact intriguing scientific theories, but hey, I am watching a horror film in the first place, not a live broadcast of the Nobel Prize ceremony! Next to this, it was moreover disappointing to see how the focus on the main characters is off as well. Donald Pleasence's priest, the character advertised as the protagonist, is nothing but a supporting role to fill the background. Seriously, he literally does the least in this entire film, he only steals the final kill in an ending that could not have been more underwhelming. In the end, this film left me feeling disappointed. I mean, when the name John Carpenter is attached to a film, I have high expectations. This one here? Aside from the science aspect and the overall likable characters, it didn't do anything about the horror. Completely unbalanced, harmless, and anything but agitating. In terms of tension, this film is at an all time low. The typical flair and atmosphere are there, but it didn't pack me at all. It hurts to write this, but even ""The Ward"" was more intense in terms of intensity, and you know my opinion about this one. Not the worst Carpenter film yet, but a disappointment, nevertheless.",Prince of Darkness
90,jcbutthead86,"An Excellent,Scary,Atmospheric Underrated Horror Film. Carpenter At His Best.",10,3 June 2013,"Prince Of Darkness is a scary,effective Horror film and is truly underrated. Filled with great direction,a wonderful cast,a creepy score and great special effects,Prince Of Darkness is John Carpenter at his best.Prince Of Darkness tells the of priest Father Loomis(Donald Pleasence)who has discovered a secret that has been hidden in a church for many years:a green container that is holding a green liquid that represents the Father of Satan,an Anti-God that is pure evil. Now with the help of Physics teacher Professor Howard Birack(Victor Wong),his students and others Father Loomis has to stop the Anti-God or it will be doom for the world.Prince Of Darkness is a great solid Underrated Horror film that not only marked the return of John Carpenter to the Horror genre but to his low budget roots as well. After the unfortunate box office failure of the excellent and brilliant classic the big budgeted Action Comedy Martial Arts Kung Fu film Big Trouble In Little China,Carpenter return to low budget films with two films the first film being Prince Of Darkness and the other film the Sci-Fi/Action classic They Live. Prince Of Darkess is the second film in Carpenter's great Apocalypse Trilogy beginning with The Thing and ending with In The Mouth Of Madness and right from the opening credits Prince Of Darkness pulls you into a horrifying nightmare that gives you a sense of dread and such impending doom a scary movie that scares you with the feel of fright and death all around. Carpenter with the ominous opening is telling us that nothing is going to be alright. POD at times feels like you are watching a dream(in fact there are several dream sequences in the film)where things are distorted and confusing and you're not sure of what is going on. What I also love about POD is the style and tone of the film because I look at the film POD has the style of an Italian Horror film mostly like the films of Dario Argento and Lucio Fulci because like Italian Horror films POD has frightening and disturbing imagines that will put viewers on edge because you don't know what they are or what they're about. The tension and suspense in the film is like a tightrope and as the film goes on the tension and suspense starts to become scarier and more frightening. Carpenter is a master of claustrophobia and isolation whether it is The Thing,Halloween or Assault On Precinct 13 and POD is no exception and is truly filled with claustrophobia and isolation where the film's main characters are trapped on the inside and want to get out but are surrounded by evil. In many ways Carpenter has used the same story as Assault On Precinct 13 but instead of a police station and gangs it's a church and possess homeless people. With POD Carpenter asks a thought-provoking question what if a demon not just the Devil himself but an Anti-God,not God the creator of Heaven and Earth,but an evil God were to come into our world and brought evil onto our world with darkness and evil. Carpenter asks these questions with the characters mixing subjects of Religion,Science and physics. But pure evil can never ever be truly explained by anyone no matter what not by Religion,Science or Physics. POD also addresses the issues and conflicts between Science and Religion represented by the characters Father Loomis and Professor Birack but the issue in POD is handled really well and done with amazing intelligence,great writing and imagination. The pace of the film will bother some people where some people will think the film is slow but I love the pace of POD because like many Horror films of the 70s and 80s POD builds up the film with tension and atmosphere and when the Horror starts it never stops. The films main characters in the film are not always likable but at the same time they are not like slasher victims waiting to get killed off and you feel sorrow and sympathy for them when things go bad. The violence and gore is simple but effective and disturbing and fits in with the grim tone of this film. The ending of the film is classic Carpenter. It's a truly scary and shocking conclusion that's very bleak and like many Carpenter endings it ends on a cliffhanger. A great ending. The cast does great jobs in their roles. Donald Pleasence is brilliant as Father Loomis,with Pleasence bring depth and sympathy to the role. Jameson Parker is great as Brian Marsh,one of Birack's students. Victor Wong is fantastic as Professor. Howard Birack and has great scenes with Pleasence. Lisa Blount is excellent and sexy as Catherine,Brian's love interest. Dennis Dun is wonderful as Walter,with Dun bringing Humor to the film. Alice Cooper is creepy in a non speaking role as Street Schizo. Susan Blanchard(Lisa)Peter Jason(Dr. Paul Leahy),Jesse Lawrence Ferguson(Caulder),Dirk Blocker(Mullins),Ann Yen(Lisa)and Anne Howard(Susan)give good performances as well.The direction by John Carpenter is brilliant,with Carpenter always moving the camera while using great angles and giving the film a dark and creepy atmosphere. Great direction by Carpenter.The score by John Carpenter and Alan Howarth is amazing,scary,intense and dark and fits the frightening tone of the film. There is also the great song Prince Of Darkness heard briefly in the film by Alice Cooper. The special effects make-up by Frank Carrisosa is great,realistic and disturbing. Wonderful make-up effects by Carrisosa.In final word,if you love John Carpenter or Horror films,you will love Prince Of Darkness,a scary and frightening Horror that is very underrated and is Carpenter at his best. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",Prince of Darkness

John Carpenter did a lot clasisc movies in the 70's and the 80's. I love Prince of Darkness, I love The Thing, I Love They Live I love these horror movies! This is people's at least favorite movie. Prince of Darkness I enjoy and I love to death!! The Thing thank god has fanbase but I don't why this movie dosen't have. I don't understand why. It has great atmosphere and great tone to the film.I love that the movie is about religion and quantum physics. Donald Pleasence is a priest and other priest past away and gave him a key to go in the basement. Donald Pleasence has Victor Wong and his other students in abandoned church to look at this green canister. This Green Canister has telecenetic moments it seems like something is aweken there what could it be? This green canister means the end of the world it is awekening Anti-God Satan him self in to our world. This quantum physicist students are possessed from this liquid. Satan him self is awekening and he wants to walk the earth again. Students Brian Marsh (Jameson Parker), Catherine Danforth (Lisa Blount) and Walter (Dennis Dun) are fighting against these possessed class mates. Kelly (Susan Blanchard) becomes Satan's daughter and she try's to pull Satan from his world in to our trough mirror's portal. Catherine Danforth is the only one that saves our world from doom and she pushes Kelly and her self in the mirror portal and priest smashes the mirror with an axe and closes the door to hell. He trappes Satan, Danforth and Kelly in the realm.Alice Cooper as Street Schizo was excellent absolutely love his performance as one of Satan's possessed henchman's. John Carpenter and Alice Copper worked on music score together. In 1986 Alice Cooper made a music score for Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives. Music soundtracks like He's Back (The Man Behind The Mask), Teenage Frankenstein and Hard Rock Summer. I love Alice Cooper and John Carpenter's Prince of Darkness music score and orchester together. I love the soundtrack sung by Alice Cooper.Lisa Blount is really missed she was really excellent as Catherine Danforth unique heroine. I love her so much. I love the style or even I love the bugs, the ants in this movie. Victor Wong was excellent as Prof. Howard Birack he sprayed one of the attackers and he throw a pencil in his eye. The special effects are excellent. The priest (Donald Plesesence) hits Kelly with an axe he chops her hand off, but she grows another. He beheads her put she puts her head back excellent.The movie is excellent they don't make horror movies like this one today. I forgot to say I love The Fog too, I love these movies from John Carpenter. I am huge 80's fan I was born in the 80's 1983. The FX effect are creative and brilliant. It does have gore and blood. John Carpenter is my second favorite master director of horror. Number One will always be Wes Craven R.I.P. I am crazy obssessed fan with A Nightmare on Elm Street 80's franchise. I really love the first Five Elm Street movies because they are 80's with Freddy Vs. Jason. Prince of Darkness is right there behind my favorite horror franchise. This is a decent horror film, it works for me and I enjoy it. I have the Blu-ray disc about this movie. Prince of Darkness also come out on 4K Blu-ray disc in the UK this year. I don't watch 4K movies but that would be really cool to see this movie in 4K. I recommend to any horror fans to see this movie.R.I.P.

93,Darkjak007,Faith is hard to come by,6,28 October 2021,"A priest(Donald Pleasence) ask a Group of quantum physics students to assist in investigating an ancient cylinder of Green liquid discovered in a monastery. After time pass the liquid slowly leaks from the canisters and slowly everybody begins to fall victim to the Presence. When it comes to the list of the films Prince of darkness along of times seem to be the film least talk about by anybody.while not the worst of his films it's most definitely one of the least fleshed out. The characters for the most part aren't really all that memorable with exception of Donald Pleasence who while psychically doesn't do much the dialogue his deliverance helps adds to the atmosphere and all around the religious aspect of the film trying to get across the theme. Just like Halloween when he's speaking your somewhat feel invested and believe what he's saying. With old voice it calm yet hysteric. The second is Dennis Dun as Walter one of the he students who might come off as a naysayer and annoying. He's the only one with any sort of personality constantly making all these jokes even though some don't hit. Until far later in the movie when everybody starts being attacked or possessed nobody offers anything their just boring. Their some this pretty pointless romance subplot involving these two people, and while they do something with their whole relationship is force you don't feel any connection toward these two. The stories pacing is also pretty slow the beginning has a descent start those credits go on for quite a while. The middle is where the movie begins to drop. You start to get kills and bizarre visuals, which are pretty decent. They try to put way to much thought and exposition, the point your just bombarded with theories of what's going when stuff should be going on at this point. The music also really good and the high uses of symbolism is done well with all these crosses and statue through The chamber where the cylinder is. To Tom and jerry on tv. So Overall it's a slow movie with fun interesting visuals and while most it cast is flat. The tone is still rather interesting especially toward the end. It not the worst but does it compete with the fog, the thing or Halloween no. I say it's more somewhere between children of the dammed and vampires.",Prince of Darkness

The film drags a bit before arriving at a climax that's too typical to be clever, but not over the top enough to be campy fun.

Its not a horrible movie, like I said, its well made and has lots of interesting elements that I wish were fleshed out more, it has the potential to be a really great movie.I like a few characters and the special effects were really good, it was nice seeing Alice Cooper, I also like the atmosphere.I cant say its bad, but I cant say its great, its good, but I was expecting more from Carpenter, I guess it just needs to grow on me.",Prince of Darkness
97,CMRKeyboadist,Probably One of the Scariest Films,10,8 September 2006,"I am sort of a fan of Carpenter. Some of his movies are absolutely excellent, and some are just kind of flat. ""Prince of Darkness"" is among his excellent films and probably one of my favorite movies altogether. The movie has loads of gloomy atmosphere, one of the scariest story lines I have ever seen, and genuinely good acting and a great score.The storyline is one of the most complicated out there so I will try to sum it up for those who have not seen this. A priest dies who has been guarding an ancient key at the beginning of the movie. This key opens the door to the basement of an old abandoned church. Donald Pleasance plays Father Loomis (Loomis being a tribute to the character he played in the Halloween films) who explores the basement of the church with a college professor. They discover a container with a strange green liquid, sealed and locked from inside. They decide to turn this into a project and bring many different departments in from the college. They discover something far more terrifying then they ever could have imagined.I remember watching this movie on video in 1988 and not being able to sleep for weeks. This really is one of the scariest movies ever made. The gloomy atmosphere and the great music score build so much tension in the air that you can sense something apocalyptic about to happen.Me talking about the movie isn't going to help unless you see it for yourself. This is not a gorefest, just very atmospheric. Check it out. 10/10",Prince of Darkness
98,kingofdanerds,This is strange....,6,8 January 2021,"John Carpenter is often considered one of the best horror directors of all time or at least one of the most well known horror director. He has directed many horror movies like Halloween, The Fog, The Thing, They Live, Christine and much more. But he has directed more than just horror. One such film was Big Trouble in Little China which was a big budget film that bombed. With that happening, Carpenter went back to his independent, low budget films and Prince of Darkness was that return. Prince of Darkness was the second film in the Apocalypse trilogy which started with The Thing in 1982 and would end with In the Mouth of Madness. Prince of Darkness recieved mixed to negative reviews at the time of release but just like any Carpenter film, would see it recieve cult status among fans. The film made bank at the box office with a budget of $3 million and recieved over $14 million at box office. The film notably sees Carpenter collaborators Donald Pleasance (Halloween and Escape from New York), Victor Wong and Dennis Dun(Big Trouble in Little China), and Peter Jason (They Live, Village of the Damned just to name a few). There is also a performance by rocker Alice Cooper.The film follows a priest (played by Donald Pleasance) who discovers a cannister of green goo in the basement of a church. Unsure of what it is, he asks some scientists to come and figure out what this green goo is. What they find out is that the green goo is the essence of Satan and when they make this discovery, some of the scientists start acting very strange....As I write this review, I will have only watched this film once. Which is nice because this is my first thoughts on the film. Before watching this film, I had no idea what this film was about and honestly had no interest in watching it. But I did watch it and....... I am still not entirely sure what I think of this film. I will just try to get what I think highly of with this film and try to move on from there. First, the score. This is a collaboration with John Carpenter and Alan Howarth and I have always been fairly pleased with their other works. This film's score took some time. At first, I could not quite put my finger on what I thought. Then I realized that what this film's score does is help with building this sense of foreboding which I think helps set the tone of the film. Some argue that the score is one of the best from Howarth and Carpenter and I will agree that it is ONE of the best. With the tone being well built by the music, the pace is slow which can be a detriment but at times works in this film's favor. When this does occur, the viewer is able to feel the forboding and at times creepy which fits well the film. The acting is pretty good but the performances are only standard at that and the characters themselves are not all too interesting. There is this relationship betweent these two characters which is not all that interesting. It is things like this that really hold this film down and at times make it feel slow. This is a horror film and how does this film do in the scare department? Well, I have seen for scarier films especially from Carpenter himself. There are a few effective jump scares but not enough to leave a major impact on me. There is one fairly memorable scene which I found fairly grotesque. Bugs anybody? There is also these dream sequences that feel unnatural which are fairly creepy. With that being said, the best part in the horror department is the overall foreboding tone. So, good job movie. The overall plot involves science and religion but it does nothing new with the concept. Especially the part with the green goo. I am not entirely sold on the part that this green goo is Satan.What it all comes down to is that this film is not very memorable at all. Sure, it has it's moments but not too many. I am sure the more and more that I watch this film (if I ever do) then it might grow on me a little more the more I watch it. Not something that I would definitely recommend but if you are curious about this film, I suppose watching it would not hurt.",Prince of Darkness
99,smellthecult-com-1,"I see thee, Satan",8,13 October 2009,"One of Carpenter's least well known horror movies, this sees the director once more turning to Donald Pleasence to add an air of menace and creepy gravitas.The plot: A team of scientists are conducting research on a strange, cylindrical object within which swirls green fluid which seems to defy gravity. The object, located in a derelict church, is of unknown origin and unknown intent. As the team learn more about it they soon figure out that, if opened, the very world we know could end. A particularly dim-witted female scientist approaches the object, head turned upwards, mouth agape, and a jet of fluid spurts into her face (calm down at the back), possessing her with the spirit of....something, which she duly passes on to any who comes into contact with her and her own mouth-propelled fluids.It's a bit odd, and never entirely convinces, but it's certainly unsettling stuff. The location is effective, though the interiors seem unduly 'studio-bound' at times, and the script tugs along at a fair old clip. Featuring some wonderfully evocative moments involving insects, in particular the collapsing corpse on the car park, this is proper horror. Carpenter's requisite nervy score is present and correct and, for fan boys at least, this is a satisfying enough affair.",Prince of Darkness
100,hrkepler,Worst installment of the 'Apocalypse Trilogy',7,10 June 2018,"'Prince of Darkness' is not master of horror John Carpenter's best film and it is weakest in his so called ""Apocalypse Trilogy"", but Carpenter is such director whose more mediocre work surpasses other genre director's film by miles. In 'Prince of Darkness' Carpenter again manages to perfectly create creepy and claustrophobic atmosphere (although might not as good as in 'The Thing') and the horror doesn't need to rely on jump scares and fancy special effects. Only Carpenter can build up such a slow an intense waiting of the doom.After some flops at the box office John Carpenter had fallen into discountenance by the mayor studios 'Prince of Darkness' was again independent film with modest budget. The low budged doesn't take anything away from the movie, on the contrary it doesn't show like a low budget film (I guess it's Carpenter's experiences working on shoestring budgets). The build up is little slow, and the action parts are little corny some times (without right amount of cheese it wouldn't be Carpenter's film), but the dialogue is magnificently written and characters (except some expendables) are rather intelligent and avoiding too much horror movie clichés. Again, Carpenter manages to create an eerie synthesizer soundtrack, that is pleasure to listen, but is not recommended to listen on your ipod while walking on dark streets.'Prince of Darkness' is above average atmospheric and intelligent horror film that uses many interesting ideas and avoids to slump into horror film clichés. It should please hard core horror fans, and is must see for John Carpenter fans.",Prince of Darkness
101,MF210,Ends up being more bizarre than scary,6,29 January 2012,"My rating: ** out of ****It's hard to imagine a filmmaker whose responsible for two of the best horror films of all time (""Halloween"" and ""The Thing"") can otherwise reek of mediocrity. Such is the case with John Carpenter whose resume is spotty at best. Carpenter created a masterpiece with ""The Thing"" and a near-masterpiece with ""Halloween"" so I'm blown away by just how mediocre the rest of his oeuvre is.Unfortunately, Prince of Darkness reeks of of that mediocrity. The film is certainly ambitious and, perhaps, mildly interesting but falls well short of where it wants to be. I don't blame Carpenter for all of it's shortcomings, it's very difficult to make a convincing apocalyptic, end- of-days type-film with the epitome of evil as the villain. I can't think of one that I could take seriously (End of Days does NOT count). That being said, Prince of Darkness come off as more bizarre than scary and I don't think that was the intention. One positive thing that has to be said of the film is, and this is true of most Carpenter films, is the score is unbelievably brilliant. Carpenter has been responsible for nearly all of his films scores, including the iconic Halloween theme. His score for Prince of Darkness has to be among his best. Like his previous scores, this is a simple, ominous score that fits the film brilliantly.Unfortunately, if only the substance lived up to that style. You would think a film about Satan would provide its share of frightening moments. That is NOT the case here. Few of what Prince of Darkness offers is scary. Worms crawling on Church windows? Bugs crawling on people? Homeless people acting like mindless idiots? People vomiting into each others mouths? Forgive me but none of this is particularly frightening. Carpenter is capable of generating an occasional ""boo"" moment, particularly near the end, but it's definitely not enough for this type of movie.What's not much better is the ""theories"" the film has to offer. My favorite is that Jesus Christ was part of an extraterrestrial but human-like race. I'm not saying the writer can't take liberties with the biblical doctrine but that was way too much for me to swallow. They take several liberties with the conventional image of Satan as well. Some of these are a little interesting but, on the whole, they're way too much to take.I'm not saying I didn't have a degree of interest in the Prince of Darkness, that would not be true. The problem is the film isn't nearly what it could've been. I normally frown upon remaking horror films that aren't that old but, in this case, I think it would be a great idea. There was much potential in this film but, like Carpenter's film career, it just reeks out of mediocrity.",Prince of Darkness
102,spencergrande6,A Slow Strangling,8,12 December 2016,"The atmosphere is incredibly dense, it's an unrelenting thickness suffocating everything else, including plot, character and common sense. But man does it work and brilliantly.The score is typically moody and great, and it's used effectively as a constantly reverberating background beat to the slow unveiling of hell on an uncoupling earth. This film works so well because it's truly unrelenting, and I don't mean in the Evil Dead sense of constant assault, but in its unbearable grip on your audio and visual senses. It's a slow strangling.This film also made me realize how great of a stylist Carpenter is. I always knew that on some level, but watching this again for the second time I realized how casual Carpenter is in his brilliance. His shots have an off-the-cuff elegance, almost as a painter so in control of his work he doesn't have to stop and savor his great images because they all are in a way, each shot into the next, a kind of constantly evolving masterful painting of horror. Shots of crosses through fence links, zombie faces awash in black and shadow, the lighting of an Argento witches movie, the soft surrealism of water dripping upward yet slowly outward towards hell, visions of ants invading the back grating of a TV set, white light from inside calling to them.It's kind of amazing. I really really wish the plot came together a bit more. I like the obtuseness of it to a point (how much could the characters really know about it all) but because of that a lot of the revelations come from people hypothesizing out loud in a way that you know the movie is trying to explain itself without actually having to -- having its cake and eating it too.",Prince of Darkness
103,tapio_hietamaki,A mysterious and disturbing John Carpenter movie,9,7 July 2015,"Aesthetically Prince of Darkness seems to be a B horror movie from the 80's, but I'd hesitate to call it such. It doesn't rely on cheap gore and sexy teenagers but rather a brooding soundtrack, several mysteries that linger in the mind after watching the movie and hard-ass scientist characters that remind me of the Antarctic crew in Carpenter's The Thing.Plot-wise, the movie combines Satan, time travel, mirrors, mind control, the walking dead, ancient Catholic conspiracies and technobabble about anti-gravity and anti-causality. So quite a few things are in the mix. I thought many of the ideas were intriguing, especially the repeating dream sequence.The main characters are masculine but not overwhelmingly so - the movie doesn't devolve into a testosterone-fest like Carpenter's Vampires. The atmosphere is more serious, there are only a few jokes in the entire movie and those are uttered by terrified characters trying to lighten up the mood.",Prince of Darkness
104,skullhead739,This really spooked me,7,9 May 2020,"I got really spooked watching this. It has a very interesting, slow going creepiness that makes your skin crawl.Acting:
Some people like the priest and professor do great. Others are pretty bad or maybe its just the dialog. The Asian has comedic jokes which is fine if it wasnt during the creepiest parts. But the main characters are good and that's most important.Special affects/cinematography:
John carpenter had a limited budget with this being a passion project. So he used all his knowledge to make real affects and tricks and it worked great! Everything felt pretty real and super creepy. Maybe just a few scenes look a bit fake but it's on average really good.Story:
I actually had to look up a video for the ending cause I wasnt sure what happened. But upon a video they said that the ending was meant to be left with interpretation. It's meant to make you ask questions and it's by no means a bad ending. The beginning was subtle and interesting, the middle was creepy and builds tension even greater. The end was the climax of creepy and made you think about new ways of horror.Summary:
Definently worth a watch if you dont mind a old movie. It's super unique with a new ideology of horror,science and religion. I've seen loads of horror movies but this one really made my skin crawl. 7/10 for me, it's not perfect but it is pretty great.",Prince of Darkness

106,quinimdb,Prince of Darkness,6,18 July 2016,"What is the source of evil? Many think it comes from within humans, even the church teaches that, but ""Prince of Darkness"" presents the terrifying idea that we are not in control of ourselves and all of the laws of science that we tell ourselves are lies invented to hide the scary truth that maybe there is evil out there that we can't understand, that is beyond our control. Of course, we hide from it for as long as we possibly can, focusing on petty romances and telling dumb jokes (*cough* Walter *cough*). We depict Satan and evil in TV, cartoons (like the ""Tom and Jerry"" episode shown in the film), or corny horror movies, like ""Prince of Darkness"" itself, so we can tell ourselves it's not real. We might try to stop it, such as the unsettling ""not a dream"" broadcast, or the various attempts by the priest to kill the thing that Kelly becomes, or finally Catherine's final sacrifice, but ultimately, we see with the ending, all of these attempts are futile. They are at most a slight delay of the inevitable take over of this ultimate evil.Yes, the acting is bad. Yes, the film is cheesy, despite some genuinely unsettling moments and images (namely, the very end, the aforementioned broadcast, worms piled onto windows, a pigeon crucified, an unusually friendly woman holding a cup of writhing maggots, and the moment where the man suddenly decomposed in the pitch black darknees outside, and the beetles that suddenly appear at his feet and climb around him, not to mention that classic Carpenter score). But I think that even this cheesiness fits with the themes of the film in a way.",Prince of Darkness
107,C22Man,"A Fascinating Blend of Horror, Science and Religion",6,23 March 2016,"Prince of Darkness is the 2nd film in John Carpenter's so-called 'Apocalypse Trilogy' and is one of the master of horrors most underrated films. It has the sense of dread and disturbing images usually found in Carpenter's films, yet it differs from most of his work in the horror field by being more dialogue driven and involving a scientific basis for its ideas. It involves a priest inviting a group of science students to study a vat of green liquid in an abandoned LA church that turns out to be the very essence of the Anti-God. For a story that sounds like it could easily become a goofy mess, the film is handled with a gritty realism and strong atmosphere that makes these absurd ideas feel so believable. Carpenter proves again that he understands what's really scary, as manages to make both the supernatural and normal seem deeply unsettling here.What is really impressive is how well the plot flows despite so many ideas being used. There's a lot of talk about science, religion and the unknown with the film managing to fuse them all together perfectly. The idea of a sect hiding the liquid for all these years and the links to anti-matter are ones that I find really interesting, and the film goes into these areas without dumbing any parts down. It gives us pieces of information but smartly keeps other areas shrouded in mystery. The true nature of the liquid is the main talking point and the way that the scientists gradually uncover the terrible secret behind it is done masterfully. There's plenty of build-up and it becomes increasingly claustrophobic as more is revealed.The film has a very creepy and unnerving vibe running throughout (similar to Halloween than say The Thing) which is utilised excellently. The calculated build-up, gradual darkness and the hordes of homeless people surrounding the church all add to this. It does contain some gory death scenes and some fantastically grotesque make-up effects, but these are kept to a minimum which adds to the shock and sequences involving bugs crawling over people or the dreams of the figure in the future add to the uneasiness much more effectively.Donald Pleasence is superb as the priest that makes the discovery. He is simply a captivating screen presence as there's something about his voice and delivery that makes you instantly take note of what he's saying, giving weight to the dialogue. Victor Wong does a great job as the professor, he's another actor who has a distinct style and is always fun to watch. Jameson Parker and Lisa Blount are slightly too wooden as the two main students, but they are believable and don't detract from the experience. Dennis Dun is the standout support as Walter, providing the films comic relief by just being naturally likable and without going over-the-top. Also, keep a watch for Alice Cooper doing a good job as the homeless leader.Once again Carpenter shows that he really knows how to make a low- budget go a long way because the film looks great and the church location is suitably eerie. Its pretty impressive that he creates such a sense of fear and isolation from a church based in LA. The editing is very good, again knowing what to show and when, while visually the film is very fluid and stays low-key which actually suits it perfectly. Carpenter provides the score and it is one of the best. It has the usual cold synth sound which adds a layer of creepiness and provides the ideal backdrop to many of the scarier moments.I'd certainly go as far to say that Prince of Darkness is one of Carpenter's more under-appreciated works. Though not up there with his very best, it is a horror film that is trying something out of the ordinary and for the most part it is very successful in doing so. It has a genuinely interesting and different idea at its core, with a plot that unfolds well and a fantastic sense of dread lingering throughout. Carpenter is near the top of his game here in terms of visuals, music, atmosphere and the acting talent at his disposal. All of it blends together to create a story that is both scary and thought-provoking, which isn't a simple feat and it deserves credit for what it achieves.",Prince of Darkness
108,shaun98,"Starts with a bang, ends with a whimper (possible spoilers?)",5,12 April 2002,"Horror films are commonly associated with the cheap, sleazy slashers of the 1980's. Many a hack director has faded in and out of the filmmaking scene, leaving little to remember but yet another quickly forgotten entry in a disreputable genre. John Carpenter has been fortunate enough to escape this fate, due to his skills as a craftsman. Ironically, the success of his best-known work, ""Halloween,"" encouraged his colleagues to make these lesser ripoffs that clogged the market. The oversaturation of slashers led to its downfall, as the filmgoing public grew weary of the vast numbers of slashers that dominated theaters and video stores.Carpenter himself can never be accused of not trying. Although ""Halloween"" is not much more complex than ""Friday the 13th,"" it nonetheless succeeded due to the skill that was put into it. It had a simple elegance that enthralled and terrified audiences, and over two decades later, it remains a horror favorite. You know a slasher is worth watching if it receives a four-star rating by none other than Roger Ebert, who even compared it to Hitchcock's ""Psycho.""""Prince of Darkness"" is arguably Carpenter's most ambitious work, but sadly, it is far from his best. One must give him credit for trying to pull it off. After all, it deals with scientists and priests who team up to prevent Satan from returning to our world and bringing on Armageddon. The first half of the film shows great promise. The setup is quite effective, as science and religion are, for once, united against the forces of evil. Donald Pleasance, playing a variation of his Dr. Loomis character in Halloween, has an undeniable screen presence as a slightly-off-balance priest who would be right at home pursuing Michael Myers himself.Unfortunately, it all goes downhill in the second half. Carpenter runs out of ideas as he halfheartedly gives us the standard genre fodder. People repeatedly make the unwise choice of running off alone to investigate missing colleagues, who have been turned into zombies by this green slime that supposedly contains Satan's essence.When the film ended, I felt depressed, and not in the way I should have been. I felt cheated and discouraged. Carpenter, of all people, should have delivered a suitable payoff for his good ideas, but apparently, he bit off more than he could chew. I think a remake is in order.** (out of ****)Released by Alive Films through Universal/Northern",Prince of Darkness
109,macabro357,The green goo,7,14 July 2003,"I missed this one the first time around back in the 80s, and despite what all the critics say, I didn't think it that bad at all. 
Ok some of it's pretty silly and Jameson Parker and Lisa Blount were about as wooden as two totem poles, but the story did keep my attention without me having to reach up and change the channel.  Plus, I really dug the tension filled pulsating synth soundtrack by Alan Howarth.A group of graduate students & scientists are called upon by Father Loomis (Donald Plesance) to investigate a mysterious canister filled with green goo that is stored in the basement of an abandoned church.  Right after they get there, all kinds of strange things begin to occur such as the homeless (led by a pale-faced Alice Cooper) going around, zombie-like, killing people outside the church, earthworms and ants clustering on window panes in strange patterns, and machines and equipment moving on their own.When the team begin to translate an ancient document that was also stored in the basement, they find out that the canister contains the energy of the son of Satan who was banished to the darkside, eons ago.  This supposedly occurred in ancient Middle Eastern times but how it got to L.A. is never explained.One by one, each of the students are either killed off or possessed by the entity that is slowly growing around them.  The scene where thousands of beetles eat away at the guy in the church parking lot is cool.  It looks pretty funny when his hands and then his head falls off, rolling around on the ground.  Hilarious.Then one of the females has all the green fluid from the canister flow into her mouth and eyes from the ceiling in a reverse matte shot.  That looks pretty cool, too. While she's lying on the cot, her stomach starts to expand and she starts to decompose as this thing is growing inside her.  It seems the Prince of Darkness is going to use her as an incubator to grow his fetus.  The scene at the end with the mirror leading into an alternative universe and Satan's arm being outstretched towards the woman was fairly impressive. It sort of looked like it existed in some kind of clear, oily fluid that had the consistency of cooking oil.All in all, I think this is a pretty entertaining John Carpenter flick to watch on a Saturday night and I consider it light years above his recent mess, GHOSTS OF MARS.  7 out of 10.",Prince of Darkness

111,MooCowMo,Satan is a Green Glob of Goo! :,6,23 September 1999,"Sort of a cross between Carpenter's own Assault on Precinct 13 & The Omen, this murky, uneven apocalyptic film from John Carpenter is long on atmosphere, short on details.  Performed by an ensemble of Carpenter vets (Victor Wong, Dennis Dun, Peter Jason, and Donald Pleasence) from better Carpenter moovies, it unfortunately also casts Jameson Parker in the lead, where he is simply not strong or charismatic enough to keep our attention. There are many creepy scenes, to be sure, moost of which involve slithering worms or insects.  The basic plot is: Satan's son is trapped in an ancient vial stored in an abandoned church (why it's there is never satisfactorily explained).  For some reason, now is the time when the son gains strength to become re-born through a host, and thence pull his father from the mirror/anti-universe he is trapped.  The story has an interesting premise, contrasting philosophy and science, comparing evil with anti-matter, but it's just too short on details.  How, for example, did the vial end up in Cowifornia when the ""ancient tome"" says it was found in the Middle East? Who is sending the video/dreams, and how?  Fortunately, there is enough of the moovie to overcome moost of the nagging questions, but only just.  The ending is rather anti-climatic, as most of Carpenter's movies tend to be.

On my second viewing however, I began to see the streak of satire that runs through this film. This film is constantly playing with the expectations of the viewer and the common tropes of the genre. This is a possession movie, a parasite movie, a zombie movie; both intellectual and accessible, funny and terrifying, god, the devil, and aliens.
It's both horror and science fiction (not to mention romance) and it takes a lot of different things from these two genres and puts them all together into one absolutely insane movie. I'm glad I could finally see this film for what it is- amazing.",Prince of Darkness

But somehow John Carpenter has done this idea into a truly terrifying and suspenseful movie. Maybe adding the whole science team made the whole movie more believable. At least this was a good movie.The story basically starts with a strange cylinder device being found in the basement of a church, and a group of scientists and college students is brought inn to find out what it is. I won't spoil much so I'll just say that if it gets opened it could mean the end of the world and that kind of stuff. And all the scientists gets trapped in the building when zombie like hobos surrounds the building and kills everyone who tries to get out. And everyone who falls asleep has the same dream who warns about a future event. Now it's a very complex movie so I'll just stop here.The movie has a great atmosphere and like John Carpenters ""the Thing"" it really keeps you focused to the story until the end. I would not recommend this for the light hearted, I mean, I thought ""the Thing"" was scary, wait until you see this! This movie is very scary and the film has aged well. There are very few bad effects in this film. On the more criticizing side, I thought the introduction of the film was a little slow, and therefore got a little boring.

There were some creepy moments but I found the characters quite under developed which did limit my overall enjoyment. Prince of Darkness is a solid horror film but not remarkable.,Prince of Darkness
117,The-Social-Introvert,Quickie Review: Prince of Darkness,6,24 August 2015,"I watched Prince of Darkness for the first time as part of a weeklong Carpenter marathon consisting of all his hits from the 70's and 80's. And to be honest, I thought it was pretty dire. I mean, nothing really happens. A group of people get together. They anticipate a baddies' arrival. He tries to come. He doesn't. The End. My main problem with Darkness is that the rules are never fully established. In The Thing we know what the rules are, we know that anyone can get assimilated and we know how. We're aware that Michael Myers (until the end?) does not have any superpowers – he's an escaped mental patient with a blade. But Prince of Darkness never fully establishes its rules – The green goo killed some people, yet other times it turned them into zombies. And why did the black dude turn into a poor man's Joker after getting snogged by the zombie ladies? And what was up with that dude who turned into a hoard of beetles. And just where did Alice Cooper go – what was he even doing in this film to begin with? It's all a bit weird really. I was also disappointed by the cliff-hanger ending, which I felt was trying to (poorly) emulate the ending of the more popular Carpenter flicks. Plus, if I were a Christian I'd be very offended by the plot. However, recently I've grown to appreciate the film. That's basically my way of saying I've gotten over the obvious flaws. It has that Carpenter tone, the score, the cast (a mixture of accomplished and b-movie actors, a regular casting style of the director) and provides a healthy amount of scares. Its middle ground. The premise that an evil anti-world co-exists with humans through mirrors is one only an 80's horror film could come up with. I guess you just enjoy it more after sitting through the likes of The Ward and Village of the Damned. Best Scene: As high as my eyebrows were raised the first time I watched it, I find myself remembering the ending more than anything else. Jameson Parker, after finally keeping evil at bay and sealing the door to an evil dimension – it was a mirror, if you're interested - awakes from a dream (or is it?) that questions the doomed fate of his lost lover, only to be distracted by the cheapest jump scare in history. Moving on, however, he gets out of bed, the music is pumping, he looks in the mirrorreaches out a handwill it touch the mirror?....his finger is close nowor will it go right through?...he's just about to touch it androll credits. Yeah it doesn't really make sense from a narrative perspective but the scene was scored and shot well enough.",Prince of Darkness
118,fred-83,"In fact, you will not be impressed at all",1,11 August 2006,"My god, what a mess. I remember watching it in the 80s, with some cuts, and not being impressed, but I didn't remember that it was this bad. Films like this and Village of the Damned (among other bombs in his later career) makes me question Carpenters competence as a director and screenwriter again. Perhaps Halloween and The Thing really were good despite him? The best thing I can say is that his strength, if any, is in atmosphere, some visuals and sometimes the music works to the films advantage. More often it doesn't however. Too many cheap sounding synth ploinks. The plot is virtually non existent. There is a setup of some kind, then nothing happens. It is almost Fulcian in its illogical plot points and sluggish pacing. The ensemble, amazingly, is quite competent and fun to watch at times, when they are not bogged down with mumbo-jumbo exposition. The whole project seems like a low-budget rush job, to cash in on the kids who might swallow it. We have one location, just throw in all ideas we can think of and see what happens. The funny thing is that the film recently inspired a dream, in which I was aware of watching the film, and it didn't make any sense either, but the scenes were scrambled together in a surreal way, and stripped down to just a voice-over reciting scientific theories and one sterile corridor with many doors, leading to mysterious room were bizarre things happened. Some day I might do a re-edit it to make it more like that dream...",Prince of Darkness
119,FlorianLaur,Fatheeerrrr!,9,3 July 2020,"If Satan is the Anti-Christ, is there an Anti-God? The father of Satan?That's the main question ""Prince of Darkness"" is asking. A rare mix of science and religion, it brings up spiritual and rational aspects.Just as any particle in the universe has an anti-particle, matter has anti-matter, etc., why wouldn't there be an opposite to the omnipotent force we call god? What would such an opposite force look like? Where would it reside? Could it even exist in our dimension?Jon Carpenter was intrigued by movies that mixed theology and science and this movie leaves it to the viewer which side he wants to take. It's what makes this movie such a great experience and in my opinion the best of the trilogy. Where The Thing or Mouth of Madness are pretty much one side of the coin, Prince of Darkness can be/is both. From the get-go, it is full of dread and makes the viewer feel uncomfortable, as if something bad is about to happen, even though there seems to be no sign for it yet. As the movie progresses, we wonder how much is reality and how much might just be a dream. Is any of it real? Is none?The movie leaves that very open. The infamous ""dream message"" throughout the movie emphasizes that this IS NOT a dream! And yet we have the protagonist of the story wake up from at least one (maybe two?) dreams at the very end. It is also interesting to note that the movie starts with Donald Pleasance's character, yet doesn't end with it. Could this be a sign that he too is just part of this dream (if it is one)? Or is it just good storytelling?Prince of Darkness will make you wonder and is very thought-provoking. I consider it Carpenter's best movie to date and probably his magnum opus.",Prince of Darkness

I remember seeing this some 25 years ago (the only other viewing I've had) but it is not as good as I remember. Or more likely, my taste in films has been finessed.I love horror and despair at the lack of quality genre output at the moment.

121,CaressofSteel75,Something is lacking here.,6,17 March 2017,"Prince of Darkness has a lot of the usual John Carpenter elements that his fans came to expect and enjoy over the years, but they somehow add up to a less than spectacular outcome in this movie. It's got a decent setup- a group of physicists travel to an old church where they discover the physical embodiment of evil that's been kept captive for millennia. Not surprisingly, members of the team become possessed, and the survivors have to figure out how stop them before the Devil finally breaks loose into our mortal realm. There are some familiar faces in this one, including a bunch who've worked for Carpenter before. Donald Pleasance has top billing as the Catholic Priest. Dennis Dun and Victor Wong from Big Trouble in Little China have big parts as well. Look for Alice Cooper who has a cool part as a street schizo who impales a man with a bicycle. Not all the casting is perfect, though. Jameson Parker is miles off course from his usual TV thing, and it's hard to figure out how he got here. He didn't pop up in this sort of thing very often. They set him up with a macho man Robert Redford mustache to give him more of that hero look, but he just doesn't come across well as the male lead in this. The problem might be that they didn't know where to position this movie. It's not as funny as Big Trouble in Little China, and there's no heroic star power in the lead. It also lacks the impact of something like Halloween or The Thing, so it kind of gets stuck in the middle. It's thirty years old now, so it looks good as an example of '80s horror with some cast members everybody likes. You can enjoy it for that if nothing else.",Prince of Darkness
122,raegan_butcher,"a tub of liquid Satan,",9,13 April 2006,"The set-up could be ludicrous: a tub of liquid Satan is discovered in an old church in LA and a group of college students, led by their physics prof, attempt to stop it from escaping into the world and bringing about the Apocalypse.Let me tell you, this movie is NOT ludicrous, its creepy as hell ! This is John Carpenter working at the top of his game. PRINCE OF DARKNESS boasts excellent cinematography( nothing new to Carpenter films; they always look fantastic, no matter what) great performances from Donald Pleasance, Victor Wong and Jameson Parker( dig his reaction shot when Victor Wong hands him a sheet of paper detailing, in precise scientific terms, the nature of the contents of the cannister) and really atmospheric music.Although critics had already started eviscerating John Carpenter's films earlier with the release of THE THING, it was in 1987, with the release of PRINCE OF DARKNESS, that the vitriol really started piling up. Its a mystery because this is one of Carpenter's most intense and interesting films and even more so than usual Carpenter has come up with a compelling and eerie synthesizer score.",Prince of Darkness
123,culmo80,Dr. Loomis vs. Satan,6,17 August 2012,"This isn't a bad horror movie but it isn't great either.The movie starts off with some of the longest interspersed opening credits ever (something like 10 minutes long, intercut with introductory scenes of some of the characters). The premise is cool; a run-down church sits atop a 16th century holding room for a canister that holds the physical embodiment of Satan. For some unknown reason, Satan is about to be unleashed so a priest in the know about this canister (Donald Pleasence) gets with a philosophy professor to put together a team of grad students to presumably stop the unleashing of Satan.Spoilers:Obviously, this is a horror movie and the team does not succeed at first. Many of the students are killed or possessed by the liquid Satan. We also learn that God, Satan, and Jesus are actually aliens who came here and that God and Satan are simply mirror images and everyone has a mirror image...or something.So the team gets trapped inside the church by possessed homeless people and they are eventually reduced to just a few alive/non-possessed individuals and they are trapped in a couple of rooms. One of the girls has also been ""marked"" to be the host of the anti-God Satan character who plans on unleashing his ""father"" who will bring about hell on earth. Well, long story short, the survivors fight off the possessed people and the main character female sacrifices herself by tackling the anti-God and throwing him back into the mirror (which is the portal to the dark side. There's more to it than that, but that really is the gist of it.I give this film props for an attempt at a very high-brow examination of religion, physics, and philosophy...even if it really doesn't make much sense.I'm not sure why Carpenter cast Dr. Loomis (of the Halloween series) for one of the main roles. I mean seriously, he even has the same van Dyke beard as Loomis in this film.The special effects are decent and there are a few genuine scares and creepy moments.Alice Cooper has a bit part as one of the possessed homeless guys as well.This isn't a memorable movie but its worth getting on Netflix if you want a good ole throwback 80's horror movie.There's no nudity, some mild language, and a moderate amount of gore.",Prince of Darkness
124,venusboys3,Nope... still don't like it!,4,25 August 2015,"I saw this way back when it first came out and it didn't do much for me then. I was never a big fan of carpenter but I liked Halloween and The Thing and Assault on Precinct 13... and The Fog... and Big Trouble in Little China... so yeah, lots of his stuff. Anyway, I kept seeing this movie on lists... for years people kept putting it on a pedestal. So I decided to watch it again, hoping that over the years I'd acquired whatever taste buds I'd been missing the first time. But nope... I still don't like it. I don't like the script, I don't like the music (I was NEVER a fan of Carpenter's music) and the actors leave me cold (they all seem wrong somehow). I think I actually liked it LESS this second time watching it. The technobabble... Alice Cooper shambling around aimlessly... the overly portentous mood throughout.

126,Blazehgehg,I want to like this movie. And there are a lot of things about it to like.,5,1 December 2020,"John Carpenter knows how to be very cool, when he wants to be.Unfortunately it's just not tense. There's a very strange, disjointed vibe to this movie, like all the dialog was adlibbed or spoken out of order, or something. Characters interrupt each other at weird times, line deliveries aren't always what you'd expect, characters don't always react normally. Some of it contributes to a feeling of dream logic that I think the movie may be going for on purpose.Other parts just don't feel like they fit. There are some very, very corny moments in this movie, some real thick cheese, and it cuts through the moments of tension in a way that can sort of ruin the experience. There are things in this movie that I think are probably supposed to be scary, or gross, but ended up making me laugh. Not because they're old, or dated, or whatever, but because they're just... silly, I guess? Out of character?Which is a bummer, because this can be a somewhat heavy, heady movie when it wants to be. It's got some interesting, high-concept ideas beating at its heart. The mixture of science helping explain religion is fun. There's some legitimately creepy atmosphere, occasionally.But then you have a jar of Nickelodeon Gak meant to represent the source of all evil. You have this movie's complete misunderstanding of computer technology, where people basically receive very theatrical text messages from Satan. You have pigeons crucified on little crosses by Alice Cooper playing a hobo.It's goofy. All I kept thinking was that I wish there were a better movie to express these ideas in a more consistent, less disjointed way. The core of Prince of Darkness is great, it's just the execution that feels like a mess.",Prince of Darkness
127,gothic_a666,So original that I wished I could say I loved it,4,5 November 2005,"I am not sure why I have this movie on my thin DVD collection. I suspect I bought it because it was a Carpenter movie and I also suspect that is the main reason why most people bothered to watch it, in the first place.It is hard to comment this movie. Overall, I would say it is flawed, on many levels. The characters mean precious little and only half way through the action do they seem to care much about the evil green container. ***spoiler*** As a result, caring for any of them is nigh impossible, which completely spoils all the effect the final ""sacrifice"" might have had. ***end spoiler***As for the green liquid...it is there, as a medium through which the ultimate evil is transmitted from person to person. Which may seem like an original idea but cannot be efficiently translated in terms of imagery. Reading the plot, this seems to be a killer, it contains all the ingredients of an amazing horror movie: the suspense, the fear of the unknown, the desperate struggle to survive and the looming presence of evil coming ever closer.Sadly, all this falls flat on its face as soon as it hits the screen. There is no suspense. Characters go from room to room, half bored, then scared, but hardly ever driven by any tension. They eventually round up to ward off the zombie like creatures but by the time they do so, we can no longer care. The impression that evil is biding its time is never achieved and surely not handled with any degree of pathos. The endings tries to scramble all the data we already had, which is supposed to make us re-think what we just saw, yet it fails to be interesting or even convincing.A few scenes were very good, though. ***spoiler*** such as the strange pregnancy-like state of comatose semi death which affects one of the characters and the subsequent make-up effects that reveal a rotten zombie-ish countenance worthy of Mr. Savini; the cockroach scene, in which a man completely dissolves into a mass of scampering roaches; the mirror scene, with Catherine eerily floating through the darkness, almost like a modern Ophelia; pretty much all Alice Copper scenes ****end spoiler***And one thing must be said about this movie, the premise is extremely original and it is a very odd piece of cinema.

128,Snoopy1,"Horrible, horrible movie",1,2 August 2004,"This movie was so terrible that I couldn't even bear to finish it.After hearing the concept of a ""liquid satan"", I made the inaccurate assumption that this movie would be campy and ridiculously funny. Unfortunately, the filmmakers took this movie far too seriously.  The premise is so absurd that I can't fathom how anybody could take this movie seriously.   First off, the movie is incredibly dated.  Many of the actors and actresses sport hideous mullets.  The overpowering soundtrack sounds like it would be more appropriate for a work-out video.  The movie tries to come across as intelligent.  It fails.  I watched this movie with my boyfriend, a scientist, who said that most of the ""science"" that they speak of is rubbish.  This makes the movie difficult to follow because it is based on utter nonsense.This movie is dreadful.  Don't watch it.

131,logicproreviews,It gets better with repeat viewings.,6,7 September 2020,"At times this feels like an unofficial remake of Carpenter's Assault on Precinct 13 (1976). Empty streets - check. Protagonists locked inside of a building - check. Antagonists lurking outside - check. Imminent danger - check.
In terms of plot however, Prince of Darkness is an enigma buried inside of a Rubik's CubeWhat can be derived from the scattered plot is as follows... a group of scientists studying an extremely ancient container holding a green, gravity-defying liquid find out that they're dealing with something paranormal and try their best to make sense of it. The inevitable evil arrives eventually, but it's a slow build and you'll need patience to stick with it.There's a blink and you'll miss it appearance by a relatively make-up free Alice Cooper who's credited as Street Schizo and Carpenter brings in the master of calm Donald Pleasence, his go to guy for Carpenter-esque exposition.While not John Carpenter's best effort, it certainly isn't his worst.6/10",Prince of Darkness

""Assault on Precinct 13"", ""Halloween"" and ""The Thing"" are all classics.But ""Prince of Darkness""? Too much of it comes over half-baked. The script feels fake and forced. Some of the performances are sub-standard. The special effects are pretty tepid, with the some of the least scary, most laughable possessed and/or zombies I've seen (with one or two notable exceptions).The plot is interesting but never explored to its full potential - for example, at one point Satan possesses a computer but the Prince of Darkness types nothing but the most banal nonsense on it.Given the number of zombies and bugs in it, the movie feels to me like a Lucio Fulci movie, only without the full-on bonkers conviction of Fulci. And I found myself wondering what the Italian would have done with it.I guarantee you this; it wouldn't have been dull. Unfortunately, Carpenter seems to be holding back for most of this film. He seems to prefer to have the characters explain the plot to each other. Sadly, this prevents the real horror from being unleashed.

The score has a pulse that adds to the overall plot of the film. Some really great practical effects that make you feel for the characters.The scares are few and far between, but this is a more atmospheric horror. Some characters are one dimensional and only used to move the plot along. Also, there are a couple elements I do not feel like were given any sort of explanation and left for the audience to decide.Overall, this is a great effort by Carpenter and company.

135,Progressive-Element,An under-rated gem from John Carpenter,8,21 May 2013,"Prince of Darkness was a return to low-budget territory for director John Carpenter, who had become disillusioned with his time at Hollywood. At the time, and to this day, it received a lot of criticism. 'BOMB' says Leonard Maltin. But while not a perfect film, time has shown it is definitely one of John Carpenter's most under-rated.Carpenter's pseudonymous screen writing credit 'Martin Quatermass' acknowledges the influence of Nigel Kneale. The film bears some thematic similarities to Quatermass and the Pit, and The Stone Tape. There's also a whiff of Carpenter's own Assault on Precinct 13, and The Fog, in that protagonists find themselves trapped with the forces of evil outside. There's a twist in this, in that what's driving the forces of evil, is inside with them...The film starts off with a series of seemingly disparate scenes that come together, a sense of dread permeates from the moment it begins. Once things start to unravel, we're in for a long night of sheer terror with some memorable, and often truly horrific heart-stopping visceral shocks, while nightmare premonitions of a hellish future pile on the sense of apocalyptic doom approaching.Donald Pleasence and Victor Wong are the cast standouts. A certain shock rocker who sang about School's Out in the 70s makes a memorably violent cameo, using one of his own stage show props. Dennis Dun - who with Wong previously appeared in Carpenter's Big Trouble in Little China - is often amusing as the smart-mouthed member of the group, constantly making wisecracks. Jameson Parker is a tad bland though as the main hero. Lisa Blount can be a little stilted too.The climax revs things up to 11, and you'll have trouble getting the last few scenes out of your head.",Prince of Darkness

I did when I was 17 when I first watched it and now found it eerie. There are so many things wrong in this movie I could see them then and still now. But the overpowering creepiness was and is there. In a way I am glad that Carpenter didn't have the budget to see his view to celluloid. I would never have slept again. In some ways this film doesn't really know what it wants to be. That in a way adds to the unease. Is it a film just about good versus evil? No. Is it a zombie flick. No. And was never interended to be. Is it an outright horror movie? Not really. Did it make sense or was the actual plot lost a bit probably under budget limitation. Definitely in my opinion. Sometimes the scare scenes drag you in. Also a feeling of what the hell is going on. Which in a way works a bit. Hell. Evil. Satan.Spoiler.The end of the movie was what really disturbed me. The future clip of the emergence from the church of evil, or maybe anti evil, I still don't understand. Did Carpenter?. But the way it was done in a future emergence just terrified me. It gave no real answers and more questions.
I watched that bit which if you have seen it will know on YouTube. It disturbed me again. So I watched the whole film again to even it out. It frightened me even more.I don't know to this day what it meant. And in a way don't want to read an explanation from Carpenter. Yes I have watched all the trilogy of unconnected films of....fear?

140,sugar_daddyo,An Apocalyptic Horror,7,24 October 2006,"It has been more than 10 years since I have seen this movie, but it is clear from reading the user comments that no one understands the basic plot. It is a little heavy and presupposes some basic knowledge of physics, so I will do my best to explain it even though it has been 10+ years.In a plot similar to the Da Vinci Code, Satan or Evil, unbeknownst to everyone, has been locked up and carefully guarded for millenia. However, the forces are starting to stir in an unusual manner, so the priest guarding the presence summons some scientists to study it setting in motion a chain of events that eventually bring about the return of ultimate evil to our world. We are gradually made aware of this because the scientists upon arriving at the church begin having unusual dreams. The dreams are messages from the future accomplished by tachyons which are particles that travel faster than the speed of light. A well known property of physics dictates that time slows to zero for particles that approach the speed of light and theoretically time goes backward if the particles ""break"" the speed of light. So we are to believe that humans in the future have developed tachyon transmissions to warn humans in the past (i.e. the present) and prevent an apocalyptic event. Unfortunately the transmission is jammed for some reason and never completed so the scientists do not know how to interpret the dream or in this case message.Eventually the series of events climaxes when a possessed student tries to bring the ultimate evil to our world but is stopped by a lady scientist who tackles the possessed student and gets trapped in the alternate dimension, supposedly all is well.However, the movie concludes when one of the scientists some time later finally receives the full transmission where it is revealed that at some time in the future the ultimate evil emerges from the church in the form of the lady scientist who got trapped.For me this conclusion provides the thought provoking idea that the message that humans in the future were trying to communicate was that the lady scientist would become the ultimate evil. So we are left to wonder if anything could have been done to prevent the chain of events, tachyons or not! It's a rare horror that follows similar themes as Terminator which I give 7 out of 10.",Prince of Darkness

This film has a brain.  it's a little talky, a little far-fetched, but very satisfying.  Its scares are genuine, not based on mere gore or cat-jumps-out-of-the-closet stuff. There's an additional appeal of a strong non-white presence (2 Asians, a native American, an African-American, Alice Cooper and Donald Pleasance are among the Leads).  Call me a bleeding heart, but it's refreshing to see a diversity among lead players, not just among murder victims.Chances are, you won't recognize any of the players here unless you're a fan of Simon & Simon, but they all perform their roles as stiff grad students adequately.  The pacing is strong.  The music, typical Carpenter moody synth stuff, drives the action, making the even the most mundane screen activity creepy.If you like smart horror movies, rent this (and the first Hellraiser, Carrie, 5,000,000 Years to Earth, Wolfen, the Howling, Assault on Precinct 13, Alien, 7even, Silence of the Lambs, Videodrome, the Dead Zone, Martin, I'll stop now).",Prince of Darkness
144,kirk.wagstaff,Overlooked,9,24 April 2001,"Since the day I saw this film, I never really quite understood why people dismissed it. Definitely in the top five best horror films I've ever seen, it is an incredibly powerful piece of work, and very claustrophobic. This terrified me more than anything I had ever seen on the small (or big) screen. The first thing you see at the start of the film is the Universal logo followed by the intro to one of the most terrifying scores in movie history. Every time this film screens on national TV, it sends a chill down my spine. This score really helps the film in many ways, it kicks along with what is happening on screen and increases the tension. The film works so well in the way it combines the contrast between a normal day at University, to a nasty claustrophobic chapel in which `that thing' in the basement is the heart of the trouble. The chapel is absolutely ideal for this type of film, it is a claustrophobic setting, and they have to sleep overnight with the entity that has been kept a secret. The graduates are analysing a strange green canister in the basement of a chapel, underneath the place where they sleep. They don't know what it is, and everything they discover about it becomes too unreal to be true. When other things start to happen they have to take note. The film combines the `what you don't see is what scares you' factor, with gratuitous violence and gore. I think they got the balance just right. Just for the record, shake off the scares and the film really isn't as perfect a film as it is frightening. Take for example Victor Wong and Pleasance muttering some embarrassing drivel. When asked about her wound, Susan remakrs; `oh, it's just a bruise', despite the fact it's of blade-like structure. What about the mirror at the end, when you see it through the door, it only appears to be half the height of the wall. Then in another shot, it's the entire height of the wall. Go figure. We see Satan's hand at the end of the film, it looks completely dis-satisfying and plastic. Who on earh lit all those candles in the basement, and at the end how did they get the darn canister up those stairs? Hmm?I also object to one particular scene in which thousands of real cockroaches were crushed underneath the feet of one of Satan's disciples. Was this kind of cruelty really necessary? In the UK leading newspaper Daily Mail awarded this film 2/5 because of `jokes which flattened the atmosphere'. What a poor excuse. Did they not see the meaning behind Walter? His role was to create an earthly atmosphere. People do make jokes, people are not going to go all depressed on us if something like this is happening. People will try and stay sane. Carpenter really pulls his character off when two zombified university graduates come after him and he panics, after which point he never makes a wisecrack again. I believe this to be a very potent part of the film and very important to the climax.I think this film terrifies so much it actually hides the minor errors completely. How special this was when I first watched it. I doubt there is another film out there that will have that same impact. I believe all religion to be the biggest lie ever told and do not believe in a god or an anti-god, but this is still powerful viewing. Although I have no reason to argue with these people, I can't help but wonder what people missed when they say this is one of Carpenter worst movies. I point you at such monstrosities as In The Mouth Of Madness, or even Christine. In my holy opinion this is Carpenters second best production behind The Thing, that excels in an incredibly powerful and gripping plot. This film has received lots of praise by me, because unlike three other films I can think of, this one is actually genuinely FRIGHTENING! One of Carpenters last great films.
Despite the fact the film had an 18 certificate when I saw it, I was 14 when I first saw this film (now they've lowered it to 15, for some reason). It was one of those films where you just couldn't stop thinking about it. Now I'm older things don't have that kind of effect anymore  That is what makes watching these kind of films when you're young, so special4.5/5",Prince of Darkness
145,dcw-12,"A geeks horror movie, a little heavy on plot and weak on scares for some",7,6 June 2009,"Whereas the Thing revealed its nebulus plot and got out of the way to allow the film to terrify the viewer. Prince of Darkness seems to be hampered by an overly elaborate plot that never gets out of the way and doesn't allow for too many scares. The plot tries to offer a scientific explanation for the religious cosmology we all grew up with. Satan is pure evil and is stored in a vat! Jesus was an ET who gave the Church diff-eq equations to use to defeat Satan in the future. This sounds wild and it is, but it requires close attention as some of these huge plot points are spoken in one sentence. It plays like Italian horror in that terrible things happen with little explanation and the viewer is sometimes left scratching his head.You have to give the film credit though for attempting to give the viewer a sophisticated and cerebral plot. Its obviously a film Carpenter was enamored with intellectually.On the other hand the scares never really heat up to the boiling point. Towards the end there are some quality scares. However like some Carpenter films the camp is thick. Not that this is necessarily a bad thing but those expecting another 'Thing' terrorfest will be disappointed. Like all Carpenter films this film is shot beautifully and when the film warms up in the second half it really sucks you in. I found myself stopping at several points in the film and saying to myself 'wow this is a beautifully shot film'.If I had to classify this film I would say its a geeks horror film. Lots of interesting intellectual things in the plot to ponder, some scares, and a beautifully shot film.Wont appeal to everyone but certainly isn't a run of the mill film, and it deserves credit for that.",Prince of Darkness
146,CoolHand-4,To the Point!,3,30 March 1999,"Being one of John Carpenters biggest fans, I am usually very biased when it comes to rating his movies (I loved Escape from LA).  However, I just could not get into this movie.  It moves very slow and the screenplay is horrible. It tried to he a horror movie, but what was scary about it? NOTHING. Donald Pleasance gives a fine performance (as usual) but the rest of the cast is below average at best.  This movie just does not pack the punch that JC's other movies do.  I gave this movie a 3 out of 10 rating, and that was because I could not give JC a rating of 1 (even if the movie sucked).",Prince of Darkness

The scares are all memorable and leave a lasting impact.",Prince of Darkness
148,Robert-132,Not bad at all...definitely worth the time...,7,8 August 1999,"John Carpenter has to be one of the most competent directors of our time. No matter how poor the script may be (such as Vampires), he still manages to turn it into a smart, frightening  movie.  And this one is no different.The plot revolves around several graduate students and professors attempting to solve the riddle of a strange goo inside a container located in an old church.  As they continue their research, the goo begins to turn them and the people around them into zombies.  As they discover this, they also begin to fear that these horrifying events herald the coming of Satan and a seven million year old evil.It is a pretty intelligent movie, all in all, with a very good climax that manages to give one the creeps for minutes afterwards.  The main characters perform admirably, and while there are a couple of lazy performances from some of the minor characters, they are barely noticable.Unfortunately, the film is marred by a very slow beginning.  Where it should be creepy and terrifying right from the start, it takes around forty minutes for the action and frights to really get started.  Once they are, the film picks up considerably and manages to deliver the goods.Although this is not as scary as some of Carpenter's other films, it is still definitely worthwhile.  It is very nice to see the occasional horror film that doesn't insult one's intelligence, and this is certainly one of them.  3.5/5",Prince of Darkness
149,aschachte,"""Annoying"" sums up this movie",3,10 September 2004,"Spoilers.I rented this one back around Halloween of 1988. I was hoping to be scared, because (as usual), the previews made it look good.So there's this weird dream everyone seems to be having. The words are garbled, so you can't understand it. The footage is grainy. It was made at the height of popularity for the 'shaky camera' videography technique (watch reruns of the first season of NYPD Blue and you'll know what I mean). And they play this clip over and over and over and over and You get the point. It was almost as bad as that '8 more days 'til Halloween' jingle from Halloween 3, Season of the Witch (an even worse movie). But at least there wasn't a song stuck in my head for the next week.If you like lots of bugs, this movie is for you! I personally don't find bugs scary in the least. I think it's a cheap way to freak people out without spending anything for special effects. 'Hey, Larry. Dump another box of roaches in front of the camera!' Yep, bugs galore. But bugs = Satan? That's where you lost me.So then they play that dream clip a few more million times. I know I mentioned this, but I'm trying to take you there on the short tour. Man, this new shaky camera thing is all the rage! Woo hoo!At the end, the girl gets sucked into the mirror with Satan and she's floating underwater in another dimension. You can see his big Satany arm grabbing for her. Then someone smashes the mirror, trapping both of them in there. You then see the look on her face as she realizes just how royally screwed she is. That was the only decent part of the movie.It makes you wonder why they didn't just smash the mirror in the first 5 minutes.",Prince of Darkness
150,riverheadestelle,'Prince of Darkness' More Like 'Prince of Confusion...!',6,24 October 2005,"Okay, here's the deal. I've seen this Carpenter flick twice. Although many say it surpasses 'The Fog' in terms of special effects and jolts, the story is somewhat disjointed and all over the place, so to speak. Not even the appearance of rocker Alice Cooper as one of the homeless-turned-zombie can save this flick. It's like Carpenter couldn't make up his mind where he wanted to go, and by the time he did, it was too late either because of budget concerns or getting the film released on time.My original take on this flick was that a bunch of university students are called together to, perhaps, study the nature of evil from different perspectives. The students represent a good cross-section of disciplines: mathematics, physics, philosophy, psychology and, of course, theology. The green goo in the cannister (or whatever it is), is merely a vehicle. The idea that somehow somebody captured Satan's essence and placed it in - of all places - a church in Los Angeles, as opposed to a location in the Vatican struck me as odd. I mean, just the idea of Satan in a can made me think of the old 50's phone prank: 'Do you have Prince Albert in a can? Well, you better let him out before he suffocates.' There were enough elements for a good story here, but for me it fell apart, especially with that stupid ending.I guess I prefer films that put the emphasis on good storytelling. Call me a purist in that way. I still think great storytelling is of supreme importance, not special effects, be they low-key or high-tech. Whereas 'The Fog' can be forgiven its inadequacies because the story is coherent and more enjoyable, 'Prince of Darkness' simply makes no sense...to me anyway. It's not a flick I would watch - even if nothing good happened to be on TV, sad to say. I'd sooner pick up a book from the library - even if it's a book I read before and enjoyed.",Prince of Darkness

152,dolce_knights43,"This movie needs a boost. One of the greatest, most underrated horror films of all time!",10,21 May 2009,"After the disappointing high budget crap that is ""Starman"", John carpenter went back to making low-budget horror films that had none of the problems faced by high budget films. One of the movies that came out was ""Prince of darkness"" an unnervingly violent and scary supernatural thriller with science fiction overtones. I'm proud to say that this is the John Carpenter we horror fans want! This is horror at it's most unsettling. The fact that Carpenter managed to combine both Science Fiction, horror and religion makes this one a must see. Other people criticize Carpenter and this movie for being inconclusive and ambiguous but I tell you now that these people have never given me a better film or even something that is of this standard.As a part of the ""Apocalypse Trilogy"",this movie surely lives up to its name in the form of two menaces in the film: the mindless, violent gang outside (led by Alice Cooper) who have a fun time stabbing and impaling people and the titular ""Prince of Darkness"" who is slowly developing inside a canister, The tension that Carpenter delivers would make your blood run cold, especially when the scare scenes are accompanied by his amazing synthesizer score. What's good about this film is its pacing: there are no useless and corny scenes which populated his previous movies and there is a foreboding sense of dread throughout the entire film. I made a mistake in underestimating the power of this film and I'm here to make sure that nobody would make the same mistake again.Bonus: The dream sequence in the movie would make you a chronic Insomniac.",Prince of Darkness

The last hour was so full of horror and mayhem, I didn't care if I couldn't follow the story, I was having so much fun watching it. I really enjoyed John Carpenter's atmospheric musical score. He's also a great filmmaker, but I find he's a very under appreciated composer. His score is what got me through some of the slow bits. His direction was also great, causing me to tense up and even startle me more than a few times. I also enjoyed the special effects of this film. There was a great make up job near the end and very cool scenes of water defying gravity. And there was also some body part severing and grossout scenes which were fun to watch.But, like I said, there were some flaws in the movie. None of the characters were that memorable, but the acting was pretty good. And this might be because I'm dumb, but I had no idea what was happening in this movie. There was some kind of science experiment, and Satan was involved or something, I don't know.Bottom Line: If you can make it to the first death, this should be satisfying to most horror fans.",Prince of Darkness

I've seen plenty of John Carpenter films growing up, and I loved everything than mans done. His style and tone just speaks to me when it comes to horror and concepts. How was the movie?Different. I think John was on a mission when he made this movie. The idea of Science explaining an ancient evil is rarely done in horror movies since the concept of horror works best with the supernatural. But in this case, it was a nice touch up of change and I welcomed it.The script was well paced. The plot wasn't convoluted, and the score was AMAZING(if you love synth music). The use of practical effects can't be overlooked, especially the use of water effects in the scenes taking place during the possessions(cool stuff). And that last scene is horrifying as hell!The characters are a bit stiff. Typical class of characters brought together for an experiment, yadda, yadda. But in the end, they do their part not tripping over one another. I'm glad I finally seen this piece of work from John Carpenter.

With this new discovery, the father seeks the help of a local scientist and his research team.The thing you'll notice immediately (apart from the insanely long opening credits) is the wonderful cast, of whom I wish I could write all about individually, but their on-screen presence speaks for itself. There's a great chemistry between the characters and the story unfolds with suspense because of it. But that's not to take away from Carpenter's great story-telling of this under-rated horror.You can't help but feel the experience should be better though; like there's a small fragment missing which could have made it a masterpiece. At times it seems to take on a different pace altogether, as though the film becomes more mechanical and rigid along the way.

167,liam_donnaz,Criminally underrated,10,19 June 2018,"John Carpenters apocalypse trilogy is, in my mind, the greatest trilogy in horror and probably cinema (even better than godfather and evil dead). All three films are fantastic in their own right, but this one seems to get a lot less love than the thing and in the mouth of madness. To a point I can understand why even if I don't agree. The first thing you have to know going in is this is a very slow paced film. That isn't a bad thing at all, it just means that it takes its time. A lot of what happens is escalation: things start to go wrong in a crescendo until the finale. And while the thing is without a doubt my favourite move and entry into the trilogy, I have to admit that Prince of Darkness is the only one of the three to genuinely scare me.Let me explain: while yes it's not as subtle or tense as the thing, nor is it as existentially insane as in the mouth of madness, the horror in prince of darkness is one of inevitability and dread. The slow burn crescendo works perfectly here in a way where you're kind of left feeling like the heroes didn't actually save the day, they just delayed it slightly and next time they'll be even more Ill prepared than before. It's a very unsettling prospect and one that left me with shivers the first time I saw it.This is not a movie for everyone, and that's not a bad thing. Some will like it, others won't.

168,The_Film_Anorak,"Creepy, striking, unsettling, grisly, classic Carpenter",8,2 November 2015,"From 1974 to 1988, John Carpenter had a run of thirteen films which gained him an iconic reputation as a film-maker. Every single film he directed in that period has stood the test of time very well, although apart from ""Halloween"" they arguably did not get as much acclaim or success as they deserved when they were released. 1987's Prince of Darkness is perhaps his most overlooked and underrated film, a return to his independent film-making roots and a who's-who of all his greatest influences.Bruised by his experiences on bigger-budget projects in a mainstream Hollywood system that didn't really know what to do with his films, Carpenter followed up (the now deservedly loved) Big Trouble In Little China with a B-movie horror where he had complete control. The only tension on set was that between the wild imagination of his script and the limits of his budget, but that was territory he could navigate like no one else. The premise owes a debt to one of Carpenter's idols, the British science fiction pioneer Nigel Kneale, whose Quatermass series of films and television shows created the now familiar template of scientists discovering uncontainable horrors. It also has a healthy dose of HP Lovecraft, another of the director's touchstones, as well as his traditional nods to Howard Hawks and George Romero. But as always this is not imitation or pastiche, rather it is a case of a genuinely individual talent showing his roots and influences.The premise of the film is a fanciful meeting point between religion and science. Physicists who are on the cusp of making breakthroughs at a quantum level discover something sinister they can't explain, and a priest from an order tasked with guarding an ancient, terrible secret realises it can no longer be kept quiet. Demonic, evil, possessed powers are leaking into this world from another dimension, which depending on your point of view is either a universe of antimatter threatening to collapse our reality into oblivion, or a supernatural evil come to fulfil ancient prophecies.The priest and the scientists (a mixture of grizzled old professors and younger students) meet to study a container, millions of years old, full of a mysterious and frightening living substance in an abandoned church in LA. The whole area is full of unease and chilling threat, from the swarms of insects around the area to the crowd of eerily silent street people who gather, led unnervingly by the singer Alice Cooper. From there the situation soon gets out of control and gory, grisly and genuinely frightening horrors follow the team around the church. Two things John Carpenter could always do better than most are suspenseful horror atmosphere and a building under siege, and here you get both for your money. The film builds up to a powerful climactic showdown, and does a really nice job of leaving the story buzzing around your head for a good while after the closing credits.This is one of my favourite John Carpenter films, a worthy addition to his horror output alongside the more celebrated Halloween and The Thing. It has enough ideas to fill half a dozen movies, a bit wildly thrown together at times but enough of it sticks to make for a compelling story. As you'd expect, the director makes light of budget limitations and builds a really creepy, nasty atmosphere. Not for the first time, he uses things that are unsettling by themselves - sudden swarms of insects, urban decay in the worst parts of town, being stuck all night in an old building - to build up the sense of dread then unleash the main threat. On top of that he takes some wildly imagined horrors and gives you just enough context and exposition to suspend your disbelief. By the end you are truly gripped, and may not look at mirrors the same way again...Perhaps the only place Carpenter's limited budget shows is in the lack of star power from the two lead actors, who don't make centre stage their own as well as the unknowns who powered his earlier Assault on Precinct 13. But there's able supporting work from Donald Pleasance, Victor Wong and Dennis Dun, and vivid shocks and gore effects throughout. Overall, this is vintage Carpenter, and striking horror.",Prince of Darkness

Let me tell you that I like John Carpenter. I think anyone who created films on the caliber of Halloween and The Thing deserve to have their movies watched without any hesitation. Carpenter hit it out of the park with Halloween and followed it up with some classic 80's fare, including The Thing, Escape from New York, and Big Trouble in Little China. However, BTiLC was really the last best work until In the Mouth of Madness came along a decade later. What fell in between was a series of meandering, laborious, Saturday afternoon actor's workshop sessions of which PoD is a prime offender. So let me get to my point already...unless you saw Prince of Darkness at the time it came out and hold a sentimental connection to it, I don't think even a serious Carpenter fan can truly find value in it when compared to his other works.",Prince of Darkness
171,steben,Prince of Fear,7,30 June 2009,"I remember this as one of my scariest pieces of movie experience, although this may have much to do with my Catholic background. The basic premise that there is a certain Satan locked in a crate in the basement was not the thing that got to me; it was the evil, evil revelation, which seems to have escaped most of the other reviews here, that sets this movie apart from all that Exorcist stuff... right, real SPOILER following: There is nothing to Exorcise WITH. There is no good Force. The father of Satan is the Creator of our world, an immeasurably evil, insane being, which was somehow locked outside our world, and the Church has covered that fact by inventing some nice Jesus pap to dull the masses. There is nothing waiting at the end of our history, except for black insanity, as the world was made to be devoured. There is no nice God, no greater Power that somehow ensures there would be a universal happy end to everything. And all this got wrapped into a thrilling story with some nasty Carpenter horror effects to boot. Boy, I was not just scared, if you have the right mindset, this movie makes you think... and then think again. Thoroughly recommended to all Inquisition and Stomp-the-Heretic College students as the first tape to burn.",Prince of Darkness
172,jackvictore,If it were made for TV it still wouldn't be worth a casual view.,4,4 July 2017,"The first half hour of this movie is your standard character development phase. Only thing is, all of these characters are as boring and forgettable as the interactions they have. A lazy attempt at menacing music plays in the background as if to say, ""This might seem boring, but trust me something spooky is happening."" A mathematical jar of gas is downstairs and trust me, its spooky! Some quickly glossed over scientific explanation and some vague and distant math equations show that there is definitely some kind of sophisticated power at force here. They do this thing throughout the entire movie where something strange occurs and then they immediately explain it. Its like watching the movie with John Carpenter sitting next to you saying ""That happened because of this, and this is what is happening here."" The entire movie is given to you one forced spoon full at a time. The plot is a poorly thought out and overly complicated concept explained by someone who doesn't know how to make the science convincing except by having the characters agree with one another in a long sequence of finishing each others sentences. Each character conveniently has the answer to each dilemma as if they had read the script and that is the only reason any of it makes sense to them. They might as well just say ""Well the reason this strange thing is happening is because that is what the script says!""John Carpenter should stick with basic concepts like a madman with a knife. This movie had too much empty dialogue and nothing truly scary ever happens. It makes me hesitant to take anymore chances on watching any of his movies.",Prince of Darkness
173,Allentoker,"john carpenter kicks a$$ again with ""PRINCE OF DARKNESS""",10,15 May 2007,"This is John Carpenter's most complex and underrated film.Prince of Darkness is an eerie, atmospheric, Lucio Fulci/HP Lovecraft style piece of Gothic horror that can hold it's own against any piece of sh*t horror movie that comes out now days about biblical horror (People who try now days usually come up with mindless Exocist 4:the Beginning bullsh*t).The story revolves around a priest and a group of scientists gather in an old church and try to solve mystery behind a vat of some green goo that just happens to be concentrated evil.Meanwhile, Alice Cooper and a whole sh*tload of homeless people stakeout outside the church and kill everyone who steps outside, and everyone inside is being turned into zombies.Donald Pleasance gives a phenomenal performance, and Victor Wong gives an equally good performance.John Carpenter's writing (under a pseudonym)is top notch this round,with a social commentary on the catholic religion that's equally as powerful as the commentary on 80s materialism in They Live.The only thing wrong with it is the real crappy make-up efx by Mark Shostram(except for the Satan b*tch,who looked pretty bad a$$).I remember when I used to read about this movie when I was a kid and how horrible reviews were on it. Everybody made it out to be one of the worst movies ever made.Every review I read was all about how crappy the movie was.But they also said the same about The Thing, and that's considered to be one of the greatest horror films ever made.Maybe Prince of Darkness is just to intellectual for the American public.But after reading the reviews for it on this website, sounds like some people just don't understand the commentary and the complexity of the story,unless they're a true hardcore fan of John Carpenter like me.It's one of my absolute favorite John Carpenter movies and I'm telling you now,don't skip this movie,it's f*cking incredible.",Prince of Darkness
174,jayroth6,Prince of Darkness,10,6 October 2008,"John Carpenter's Prince of Darkness (1987) Throughout the 1980s John Carpenter was pushing forward for larger approximations of the world and the potential for collective struggle within it. He never repeated the same plot, much as the success of Halloween (1978) threw temptation across his path. Indeed, Halloween is the greatest thematic departure for him until he reached the solipsist heights of In the Mouth of Madness (1995). From Assault on Precinct 13 (1976) onward, Carpenter's great theme, echoing that of films as diverse as Potemkim and Rio Bravo, is: we have the same goal, let us put our differences aside and struggle together. If Carpenter had come along in a different historical period, when more social struggles were succeeding in the world, his films may have been more optimistic.Prince of Darkness is a powerful film about an ensemble of scientists who think they are studying a great Something; actually, it is studying them. The research team is destroyed and we are treated in the last moments to a glimpse of something truly extraordinary.",Prince of Darkness

The music itself is a constant heartbeat-like beat that burrows itself into the back of your neck throughout the entire movie. I've read so many comments that pan this movie in every aspect. In my opinion long speeches and character development aren't really that necessary. Special effects, especially nowadays with so much CG would take away what really is frightening here. And what is frightening and will always be so is the very idea of what is happening. The idea that evil does exist, and the very evil we would expect a church would give us sanctuary from is actually being born within. The scattered dream that all the characters share is wicked. Jittery and hard to understand at first and so gradually becoming clear is f*****g scary! And if one listens to the comments about people not even looking like zombies then they must have missed where on of the characters is actually made of cockroaches, falling apart after giving a warbled foreboding warning of what to expect.

A good idea is underpinning the premise of the story, yet I feel it was weighed down by too little attention to detail. For example, the attempts at being ""scientific"" in this movie are simply abysmal, perhaps some of the worst I have seen. Also, there is a huge gap between the fact that ""the prince of darkness"" is all-encompassing and extremely powerful, and the fact that it concerns itself with controlling of a few university students. Simply put, the film asks me to disregard too many holes in its logic.

I can't remember many of the things mentioned in other comments, such as the dreams - I think I have repressed them so that I can sleep at night. What I do remember is the eerie, dark atmosphere, the appropriate music, and the sense of dread and inevitability as everything started happening. I was far too on edge throughout to be troubled by dodgy physics or holes in the plot. I am never going to see this film again, it is not worth the wear and tear on my psyche. I am not a horror movie buff, and I scare fairly easily. Some people apparently didn't find this movie scary.

The scientific explanations are a wonderful, the music is the scariest ever made (that I heard) and the plot is plain out evil. There is no help, no hope, no redemption. This is a huuuge step up from the cheap chockscare and gore we usually have to gobble down, the music and the plot slowly grinds down your defence until you are scared for real, which never ever happens to me ordinarly.

Wonderfully cast with such John Carpenter screen regulars as Donald Pleaseance and Victor Wong we also get to see Alice Cooper as one of Satan's evil minions. The film fails in the respect that this movie can't possibly be scary or believable to anyone who isn't of Christian faith.

191,jjunebb,For those who appreciate the creepiness of the art house feel horror movies of the 1980s,9,1 May 2020,"Prior to the onset of CGI in the 1990s, horror movies of the late 70s through the 80s pushed the boundaries of good taste using latex and glue, and enjoyed over a decade of grotesque special fx makeup and masterful puppetry to bring their gore and monsters to life on the screen. Probably because I was alive to the times I became both enthralled and aghast at the cinematic innovation of the era. Who could forget the body reconstituting from a few drops of blood in ""Hellraiser"" (1979), or the scuttling little spider alien face-hugger that became the jaw-dropping Giger monster in ""Alien"" (1979).
Films such as ""The Brood"" (1979), ""The Thing"" remake
(1982), "" The Blob"" remake (1988), and, of course, ""The Fly"" remake (1986),
took full advantage of these gruesome new leading-edge techniques.
In particular, Cronenberg and Carpenter embraced this sub-genre.
So it is with ""John Carpenter's Prince of Darkness"". Be prepared for grisly, body-horror effects, and a disgustingly unique method of transmission of an organism from person to person.
The story begins with something ancient and evil growing in the hidden depths of an old church. Society's outcasts surround the building with gleeful fervour, insects fester in the grounds, while a professor, a priest and a group of students must first decipher exactly what it is, in order to prevent its manifestation.
British actor Donald Pleasance is perfectly cast as the anguished priest despairing that the unthinkable is unfolding under the very institution designed to prevent its release. He enlists the aid of an incredulous professor of physics, Dr Birack (Victor Wong), and a hand-picked group of clueless students to thwart the evil before it can take purchase.
The group hunkers down to do their investigations, using computers to track the entity's gestation,when things take a srrange twist. As each fall asleep they share an identical dream with the priest, his a recurring, yet shifting nightmare that he describes as ""Having previous knowledge of a future event"": i.e., a premonition of the end of the world. Brian (Jameson Parker), trying to make sense of it from a scientific point of view, describes a tachyon, a hypothetical that travels faster than the speed of light. He postulates that the dreams are vehicles of a doomsday oracle meant for those living in the present, emanating in the past, to foresee the inescapable future.
As the priest prays, the team struggles to find out if it possible to avert the inevitable. Time is running out,the church has become unstable and although escape has become impossible due to the ferocious occupation by the outcasts and insects, one by one, the trapped students begin to disappear.
With increasing desperation humanity and technology take up the battle against oblivion, pitted against a barrage of nefarious obstacles.
John Carpenter is a master of slow building tension, allowing terror to simmer to the rhythm of a his familiar pulsating soundtrack.
This film is unsettling, quietly terrifying in the fashion of ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers ""(1986 version), another film that created stomach-churning state-of-the-art special fx using hands-on art departments.
Ultimately, the explosion of CGI in subsequent years has been both a boon and a bust in a similar way other technologies have enhanced or disrupted life. Its overuse has become repetitive and the diaphanous sheen has faded.
At the same time, non-digital, tactile fx remain an exciting and enduring motif of wondrous imagination, as is evident here.
""John Carpenter's Prince of Darkness"" is maybe a little too slow for modern audiences, however, the pace pays off as the longer you watch the more chilling it becomes, the music reverberating with the sounds of a distant, deadly heartbeat. It is a treat for those who appreciate the creepiness of the art-house feel horror movies of the 1980s.",Prince of Darkness
192,SmgBag1,Pure Evil Where You'd Least Expect It,10,3 October 2014,"""Prince of Darkness"" is easily up there on the list of the top 10 scariest movies of all time. I first saw it when it came out in 1987, and what drew me in was the stunning scene in the TV trailer of a green fluid defying gravity as it pools on the ceiling and then shoots down. But more about this later.Directed with flare by John Carpenter—a master of terror and suspense in his own right, with classics like ""Halloween"" and ""The Fog"" to his credit—the film's headliners include the late Donald Pleasence and the late Victor Wong. Viewers will also recall Jameson Parker (Simon & Simon), Lisa Blount (An Officer and a Gentleman), Thom Bray (Riptide), and rocker Alice Cooper, who plays one of the homeless vagrants central to the action when the plot literally ""goes to Hell"".The film opens at a Los Angeles monastery where a priest with an odd-looking box on his abdomen dies in his sleep while waiting to meet with a superior. Enter Donald Pleasence's character, a priest who discovers the contents of the box. It's the key to a basement room in an old church where an ancient secret awaits. Professor Howard Barak (Wong) teaches a class of graduate students in theoretical physics, Brian Marsh (Parker), Catherine Danforth (Blount) and others. They've all been requested to assist in the investigation of a cylindrical container of spinning green fluid that is soon learned is the essence of Satan himself, and has been contained—or imprisoned—there for 7 million years. In a slightly later scene, with the bulk of students discussing their findings in ancient scripture, into the basement room walks radiologist Susan Cabot, who's been brought in to x-ray the container to see if there's any danger of it opening. The answer to that question turns out to be irrelevant when the container leaks the green fluid, defying gravity so that it falls ""up"" and pools on the ceiling. Then, with focused directionality, the liquid shoots down in a solid stream into Cabot's mouth. She gags and collapses to the floor, soon turning into a zombie. Following in close succession are students in Barak's group until a small group of unaffected students is left to prevent the all-powerful anti-Christ's entry into the world, meaning the end of the world.Almost in concert with that presence is that which drives the homeless vagrants on the street, who trap all the students and their superiors inside the church, and so the suspense builds to the shocking end.""Prince of Darkness"" is scary as hell, but it's also great fun to watch. Driven by a musical score written by John Carpenter—who also did the music for the classic ""Halloween""—that stays with you long after the movie ends, this one is worth your time. Donald Pleasence and Victor Wong are gone, but this film immortalizes them. And their presence gives the story an extra punch.",Prince of Darkness
193,Tbo7,"The guy that made Halloween & The Thing, made this?",1,26 June 2017,"I guess when the creative juices are flowing, you've just got to roll with it. But this movie is beyond awful. The entire movie has this lame synth beat playing that kills any sense of tension. The characters are all boring, and the acting very wooden. The creature effects are awful too, with ""super soakers"" basically being the enemy's most lethal weapon. Also I have never heard so much exposition in a movie. Literally every other scene is a professor explaining what's happening, and what's about to happen. When you have to resort to that, the movie shouldn't even be made. Audiences she be able to understand just through a more fleshed out story and better film making.It's a decent concept, but when pen met paper I have no idea how someone okay'd this. I guess Carpenter just had that much sway at the time.Do yourself a favor and skip this pile of trash.

The first time I saw it I was about 10 years old, and it scared the snot out of me.  About 10 years later or so, I saw it again, and it wasn't very frightening at all.  It may be that Prince of Darkness suffers from the same fate as Exorcist and Jaws -- it's dated.  12 years ago it may well have been a scary movie, but today it's fairly tame, and I expect to see it on the Family Channel's Halloween Film Fest one of these years.",Prince of Darkness

196,serloren,Overlooked classic from Carpenter,10,8 September 2001,"This is one of the spookiest films of all time. All that's required to really ""get it"", is an ability to allow a movie to drive you to it's conclusion. Let the music seep in, let the camera work draw you around, and let the story breathe inside your mind; and you will ""feel"" this film. Carpenter isn't a big believer in movies that are long on intensive explanatory dialogue in every scene to get the point across, he gives you enough to let your imagination take you the rest of the way, and layers in nuances and statements about issues and society that are very subtle and often overlooked by critics and audiences alike. No one seems to think that a horror film can make real statements about politics, society and theology; or that they can have any important questions to ask unless Meryl Streep is in the cast. Those people are wrong. Many of Carpenter's films do exactly that, but they leave it in the sub-text and the unspoken places, where we are responsible to figure things out for ourselves.Can you watch a Carpenter movie just for the fun of seeing a boogeyman movie that makes you jump and squeal? Of course you can. His current movie ""Ghosts Of Mars"" is, on the surface, a crash-n-bash action flick propelled by overt violence on a par with anything by Stallone; but underneath, if you choose to look at it, there's so much more.Prince Of Darkness moves and works on so many levels, everything from teen cringe-fest to social commentary, and it's messages are truly scary.",Prince of Darkness

Oh man! It's creepy and exceedingly ominous and the shaky-cam newsreel quality gives it an extra punch.The plot: You don't have to be a genius to understand what is going on in this film, but you do need to pay attention. The supernatural physics is a little nonsensical, of the ""Popular science"" variety, but the basic premise is explained in layman terms.The characters: Actually, while the ""science"" is hocus-pocus, I really liked that the film's characters were mostly grad students. The actors do a great job of portraying annoyed, skeptical science grad students. Horror flicks are filled with numbskull undergrads, and it is nice to see the hidden sector of college life revealed in its nerdy glory.The skinny: I'd describe it as a Biblical/Lovecraft horror film. It's got the whole ""evil universe"" theme running alongside an effective ""Hell breaks loose"" plot.",Prince of Darkness
198,Johnny K-2,A good film that has aged well,7,13 December 2001,"I first ""Prince of Darkness"" maybe ten years ago, and wasn't that taken with it. The idea of scientists investigating religion was interesting, and it had the names ""John Carpenter"" and ""Donald Pleasance"" on the poster, but I found it to be rather plodding and not half as scary as I'd hoped.
I've since returned to it a few times and it has definitely grown on me. Like most of Carpenter's work, it has aged very little. The science/religion concept is still a winner, and the typically-ordinary Carpenter protagonists are very likeable and contemporary. Donald Pleasance and the late Victor Wong are great together, Carpenter stalwart Peter Jason pops up in a lesser role, and the ragged assortment of post-grad students are spot on. I must admit that I've developed a dislike for Jameson Parker's lead-role casting over the years, but I can't seen the likes of usual suspects Kurt Russell, Tom Atkins or Darwin Joston pulling this one off.The pace of the film is not breathtaking, but it is steady and the tension builds beautifully (something my youthful impatience failed to appreciate). It contains some truly memorable horror scenes and a superb religion-heavy score. There's some similarities to a number of forgettable zombie flicks as the film moves on, but it all hangs together beautifully for the most part. And while the tempo slips off the rails for a while towards the end, the finale still delivers some scares and plenty of punch.
Overall, this is not Carpenter's best (""The Fog"" still gets my vote over ""Halloween"" and ""The Thing""), but this low budget movie puts most mainstream horror films of the time to shame.Definitely worth a watch. Mind the cockroaches.",Prince of Darkness
199,archyros,I figured out why some love this film and others hate it,10,17 September 2005,"This in not only one of Carpenter's best, it is one of the scariest films that I have ever seen. And I saw the Exorcist near the end of its original theatrical run, alone in a huge theater. Prince of Darkness is too much for me to watch alone at night.I really identify with the characters, the students. And that may be why it is so scary to me, because I understand what they are talking about.But that is what makes the film impenetrable to most of the people who hate it. Not trying to insult anyone, but this film is really aimed at science nerds who think scary thoughts while alone in the dark in the night. Those who look for some guy in a mask stabbing people, or goopy aliens tearing people apart will be disappointed with this movie.This movie is good for those who love to read, especially love to read horror and sci-fi. This movie is too literate for most.The not-a-dream sequences are creepy because we are trying to figure them out, and can't quite get it. And the last is the scariest, because the murky figure has become the woman who went through the mirror. Looks like Satan's dad found a vessel to come into the world.

200,blix,"One of my all time favorite films, it is nonetheless riddled with flaws.",8,27 October 1998,"I saw this movie right around Halloween of 1987 and I would not be exaggerating to say it changed my life. The overall vibe of the film (you might say ""ambience"") stuck with me for years, spilling over even into my dreams and effecting all of my own art/music/writing like some kind of disease. This film will stay with you forever if you open yourself up to it in the right way. Nevertheless, it does have some glaring flaws: The credits run for about 10 minutes into the movie, interrupting the flow of the story and just plain annoying the heck out of you. The last half of the film decays into a zombie flick with people walking around like robots so that you sometimes wonder if the same person who wrote and directed the first half wrote/directed the second as well (maybe he was possessed). The dialogue between Jameson Parker and the redhead is not only corny, but stupid. But the overall vibe of the film manages to transcend these drawbacks creating an unforgettable horror film.",Prince of Darkness
201,Larri123,Oh god--the pacing! the pacing!,3,27 May 2001,"Maybe the story was good. Unfortunately, I can't say for sure since Carpenter's painstaking direction failed to hold my attention for more than a couple of minutes at a time.  I know it's unreasonable, etc. to hold a director up against his previous work, but c'mon John, you know better than this--where Halloween was riveting, Prince of Darkness was, well, tedious.It did have it's good moments. The makeup was effective, and Alice Cooper does creepy as well as you could hope. ""Prince"" also ranks high on the Eighties kitsch scale--I counted three mullets, and that handlebar moustache speaks for itself.On the whole, however, I'd recommend this only to those blessed with extreme patience and attention spans.  It's not worth the $2.99 at Blockbuster, but if you come across it on FX or something, it might be worth your while to flip between it and ""The Jeffersons.""",Prince of Darkness
202,danielc9-2,"This is one of the greats of the horror, terror, scary films",9,9 November 2000,"This movie is one of the all-time scariest and in the top 10 all time of horror films.  I rated this film a 9 on IMDB not because it is a Masterpiece like Citizen Cane or The Godfather, but because it is a 9 or even 10 in the genre of horror films.  Horror films can be greats or even classics with low budgets in the making that is what sets them apart from the typical film. Great horror classics take imagination and guts to make not money.  This movie was has some flaws, but you quickly forget about them once the evil is released in this story.  This is a highly recommended film just like The Exorcist or The Shining is.  Also I have read many of the other user comments and do not pay attention to people who slander this film they usually leave comments like confused or confusing that means they did not pay attention or never gave it a chance.  I tell you as a person who has seen 1000's of horror films, films that have been banned in many countries and films you can not see anymore cause they do not show them on late night TV anymore that this is a great horror.",Prince of Darkness

I was on the edge of my seat and had a couple of scares. :)The story was unique, the ending unpredictable and it kept me thinking about it once the film had ended.Interesting and varied characters. I love Carpenter's use of multiracial actors in non- stereotypical roles. I mean, Victor Wong, come on! :DThe same can be applied to women characters in his films. The women weren't just there to support the men, they played equal roles. Refreshing, particularly for the age of the film.Really simple yet effective use of special effects. In a world where special effects are overdone and used simply in an attempt to shock audiences, this film had the right amount and it was entertaining without being cheesy. Loved it.",Prince of Darkness
205,captaink99,Disturbing...,10,27 August 2002,"I think you can look at this movie in 2 ways.  Low Budget, trashy, cliched, horror flick.  Or you can look at it as trademark Carpenter movie..Well.. In fact theres a third way you look at it..  Low budget, cliched at times (sure), trademark Carpenter (sure), but also as a movie that delivers a well told story of the 'devil coming to town' but presented in a very unique way.I found the way this story told, quite disturbing.  If you can suspend belief, and get over the cliches like the possessed zombies, Alice Cooper being impaled, the cockroaches and other creepy crawlies.Then what your left with is classic Carpenter.  A very brooding and haunting musical score that runs through the movie.  The sense of impending doom and the struggle to fight against some opressive force.  The feel of claustrophobia that has always been in a Carpenter movie (i.e. Precint 13, Thing, Fog).But what takes this movie up a notch from the classic Carptenter movie, is the way that science and religion work at first against and then together to deliver the message at the end of the movie.* SPOLIERS * This movie focuses on the evil that would one day rule the earth, and how the scientist and their technology may actually stop this from hapenning.
The ultimate message that is delivered at the end of the movie leaves the audience with an overall sense of unease and hopelessness that the future fate of mankind had already been decided, and really the audience had been lulled into a fall sense of security during the penultimate struggle that had played itself out in the last hour of the movie.I would urge you to watch this movie.  I would ask you to put your cynical mind aside.  I would urge you ignore some of the cliches that Carpenter used in this movie.  And try and sense the impending doom and hopelessness that eventually occurs in this movie.",Prince of Darkness
206,Nachtritter,"Science & Religion, Anti-God and a hint of Lovecraft!",10,26 July 2002,"This movie scared the hell out of me when I was a kid. It wasn't the action that scared me so much as the creepy atmosphere, and above all else, the hopelessness and dread of the story. There is also something very Lovecraftian to this movie, in that the horror lies in the whole situtation, and there is no hope of escaping the madness of it all. But then again, Carpenter has done other very much Lovecraftian movies, with ""The Thing"" and ""In the Mouth of Madness"" very much Lovecraft-inspired... which is also a goooood thing, because that's a damn good influence!************Possible Spoilers**************This movie is totally hopeless (in a positively scary sense!!)... Indeed, everything in the universe has its opposite, mirror image, and that includes absolutely every type of matter. People believing in the idea of God, of a supreme mind willing the destiny of everything that exists, will probably freak out at the idea of that same God being, instead of a positive being, an Anti-God. But if a God truly was, would He really be as we'd like Him to be? That, alone is scary, and reminds me of the deities of the Mythos, like Azatoth or Nyarlathotep... Oh, and add to that the possibility of sending communications back in time, by emitting them faster than light, which could very well be done sometime in the future (read about Gunter Nimtz's experiments, for exemple).This is not gory or ""watch for that axe murderer"" (although there are hints of both here and there), but it does have its charms : a great score, a creepy philosophical concept, Lovecraftian psychological terror, and a great ride into the bleak, hopeless, and apocalyptic.Subtle, and disturbing, for those who can think and immerse themselves in an horror movie WITHOUT the need for excessive gore and makeup.",Prince of Darkness

It provides a great cheesy and entertaining suspense since the beginning, but sadly one cannot relate with the main characters, being themselves portrayed in a very cliché kinda way. Leaving the audience without any care for what will happen to them.On the other hand, the plot grabs us with the promess of not letting us go until we leave our reality. As a truly great director, Carpenter knows best, and he give us a hell of a climax but not without giving us an unsettling question towards ourselves.

209,jpfordguy,"Creepy, atmospheric, and very well done.",9,1 November 2017,"This review has potential spoilers. Suffice to say, it is still a very creepy film after nearly 30 years, and you need go no further than that.I read some of the negative reviews about this movie, and about the acting, and I just sort of shake my head. They are missing one of the key aspects upon which this movie stands: disbelief. And it's also the same reason why you can watch this film maybe 40 years later, and it would probably still creep the livin' h*ll out of you.Indeed, it starts a little slow. The music Carpenter adds for the non-dialog scenes builds a very thick sense of dread. But it's when they get the graduate students is where this film gets legs. The students and the professors, all of whom are very scientific and rational people, are asked to analyze something that only lives in what modern Man thinks is nothing more than Dark Age superstition. Yet, the green goo is there, in all of its horrible glory. Moreover, not only are they asked to PROVE that this is evil incarnate, but find a way to stop it. And their reactions reflect their basic struggle to come to grips of what they are seeing.And yet, Carpenter's sound track rolls on. It really does give you the creeps.And that's the genius of the film: the fact that the security of modern thinking has just been ripped away in one fell swoop, and you're staring straight into a chapter or two of Revelations of John, in the flesh. And you're trying to turn it all back with test tubes and computer print-outs. Even early in the film you get the impression that this isn't going to end well.And then there is the dream sequences that lengthen as the movie rolls. This is also key to the movie, for reasons that I won't explain because it is a potential spoiler.To that end, this is a film whose premise is to turn Christianity on its head. For those of faith, this is a bit of an issue. I personally put that aside - it's a horror film, and a flight of fancy. All in all, this film is best experienced in the dead of the night, in a darkened room, alone. That you'll get it.The last scenes in the movie are undoubtedly the best.",Prince of Darkness

Saw it again on DVD after all these years and it still scared me stiff. The music is as always with Carpenter sublime, perfect for the movie and great even on its own. Comparing it with more recent stuff like the execrable new Exorcist one can only see the genius of Carpenter. Donald Pleasance is great as is, of course Victor Wong. Oh and Lisa Blunt.... Sublime As for the main prop, all too many people here have bashed the film for the ""silly factor"" of the ... Well they are wrong, its no more ""silly"" than any ""Devil Movie"", on the contrary, on that particular aspect its probably far better than the vast majority and although its not quite the Omen, its certainly no worse than the (original) Exorcist, which is the template by which any such film has to be judged.",Prince of Darkness

213,goplastic,Carpenter's Most Accomplished Film,10,23 February 2004,"Personally, I find this film to be Carpenter's best. Although the apocalyptical approach was reconstructed in almost all his films, like `In the Mouth of Madness', `They Live' and `The Thing', with `Prince of Darkness' he did it in the most disturbing and anguishing way possible - from the score, to the filming locations, to the straightforward (but effective) plot itself. It just exposes this extreme atmosphere of doom and horrifying fatalism that leaves you terrified and thinking that evil, in its purest form, may actually expose itself and consume the world. It may look cheap, but that's the whole point. A big budget would probably destroy the veracity of the film. I won't describe the script, to avoid spoilers, but that mirror still gives me the chills.

214,dgraydgrey,A merely mediocre film from a director who's done much better,5,2 December 2013,"This film, a sort of spiritual successor (if not in any way a sequel) to Carpenter's The Thing, and a spiritual precursor (if not in any way a prequel) to Carpenter's In the Mouth of Madness, falls short of both films. It offers a promisingly surreal and creepy foundation - a recurring, seemingly nonsensical nightmare that plagues the characters - but the edifice Carpenter builds on that foundation is disappointingly shaky. A genre-flick-star-studded and talented cast has little to do in between action scenes but sit around and reveal to each other the increasingly ludicrous, pseudo-rational explanations for what's occurring. (The contrast with The Thing is stark: there, the peripherally knowledgeable parties are taken off the table quickly, and the threat is believable because the investigative tasks are thrown over to desperate and semi-lucky guesses by Kurt Russell's MacReady.) By presenting famous faces as academics offering up pat justifications, up to and including the name of the threat they face, ""Prince of Darkness"" forces the viewer to examine the double-talk more closely - something that almost always spells doom for a picture like this one. We begin to note those justifications' derivative origins and laughable premises, and it's hard to follow along in good faith after that. (Remember when, in The Thing, David Clennon's Palmer cut in with spastic conspiracy-theory rants about Chariots of the Gods so obviously panic-stricken and unreliable that they brought what could have been a goofy premise back down to earth by contrast? I don't know what that cinematic spice is called but ""Prince of Darkness"" could use a dash or two.)The tension is ramped up slackly in the film's first part through introducing some non-scary (and class-questionable!) threats straight out of a 19th-century pulp novel for boys. These threats are played out in violent action scenes more reminiscent of Carpenter's weaker efforts or those of his less accomplished influences - reportedly, one sequence even comes directly from the already-aging-in-1987 rock-'n'-roll stage show of one of the cast members. Later, blessedly, Carpenter supplements these ho-hum evils with the psychedelic special effects that have always buttressed his productions. The cinematography, lighting and staging are at least effective, giving the impression of the world slowly dimming out like a dying light bulb's glow around the characters (even if we see precious little of that world by the film's design).By the end of the film, ""Prince of Darkness"" has nearly redeemed itself as the ridiculously rational explanations for events get sidelined for the frenzied and phantasmagoric denouement. The original nightmare is revisited yet again with an explanation far more incomplete and suggestive than those offered for every other event in the script, making that one part of the film all the more interesting compared to the confused horror-action mishmash surrounding it. If you are a Carpenter completionist, then you already have justification for watching ""Prince of Darkness"". If you aren't, realize that this one isn't his best - not by a long shot.",Prince of Darkness

There are a few interesting parts but mostly it was quite predictable and boring. To give credit where credit is due, the special effects are not bad considering a 1980's film and a low budget... but that's just not enough, your waiting the whole movie for the key ploy to unravel and then then when it finally does its soon removed in a highly predictable and just outright lame fashion. The acting was on the whole nothing to write home about either, not terrible, but no golden globe awards here that's for sure. This movie simply doesn't bring much that's new, its a very stereo- typical 'cliché 80's horror film, fairly gory to try give some cheap thrills to compensate for a lack of complex plot and ideas of where to take the story since the initial premise'. if you like cliché gory 80's horror films, then maybe this review is not one you should take into consideration, but if you are like me and enjoy horror, but expect every movie to truly be original to a reasonable extent and horrify in ways other that cheap lame gore, then ask me for a recommendation.",Prince of Darkness

As with most Carpenter movies you can attack the acting and dialogue, and all the philosopho-scientific hokum seems a little convoluted, but between the music, the subject matter and the pacing, Carpenter builds the tension in this movie to the point where even hardened horror fans are on the edge of their seats.  It is for this reason that many people regard this as the greatest Horror movie ever made.Playing something like a Carpenter 'best of...,' with elements from the plots of the Thing, Assault on Precinct 13, Halloween and even Starman, the movie throws about half a dozen menacing forces at its protagonists. Carpenter scares his audience just enough from each angle that upon repeat viewing the whole thing seems much more deftly done than the onslaught it seems the first time.So long as you can let all the faults pass, which are standard of 80s low-budget movies of this kind, you can appreciate this as being perhaps the most chilling film of all time.  Relative to the rest of Carpenter's work it probably won't stand the test of time the way that the Thing will, and although cult viewing it lacks the insanity of In the Mouth of Madness (probably Carpenter's last half decent film), but its reputation among film afficionados and video-store-clerks will doubtless remain very favourable indeed.",Prince of Darkness

And a lot more of course, since there are so many entries to this film, including the usual political/social and racial ones that are usually mentioned about Carpenter's work. This little community of scientists can be seen as a social cross section (sorry) of the various people that gather in a lab. They are all nerds, but they are human, so human, in all their action, that their contribution to the mystery is not only pure action of their intellect but mostly dictated by what they go through as human being and social characters. The scientific world does not usually expose this part of its reality, protected behind its own myths and figures of pure brain logic power, and this explains I think why there are so little representation of the scientific world in movies that actually hold up to some truth about how the scientific world truly works.

However it's a comfortable spot. You don't have to think or be involved too much, Carpenter is taking care of the action.

The guy that played the physics professor also did a really great job acting that one out. I especially liked how whenever he had to say something with some emotion in his voice he kept one of his eyes three quarters of the way shut. Do I smell an Oscar for this man?

The stupid trivial killings are absolutely worthless. These street people that are mindless drones is again, worthless. The piercing with the bicycle comes to mind. Alice Cooper, although freaking in his own right, makes a pathetic Street Schizo, talk to wardrobe! The story is well worth seeing. The green coffin, the prince is worth seeing too, except the terrible script of ""FAAATTTTHHHERRRR"", just doesn't cut it. Better to say nothing.

I'd say the only cool part of this film is Alice Cooper leading a horde of homeless zombies.",Prince of Darkness
