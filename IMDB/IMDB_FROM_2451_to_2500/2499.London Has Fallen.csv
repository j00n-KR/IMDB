0,TheLittleSongbird,More like film quality has fallen,1,1 October 2016,"As somebody who really tries to find redeeming qualities even in bad films, it has been a while since this rating has been given out being a generous and honest but also less-easy-to-please than when first signing up seven years ago.However, it is rare to find a film with no redeeming qualities whatsoever, regardless of how much you look for them. And before anybody defending the film flames me, personally really made a real effort to take it for what it is, a mindless ""turn your brain off at the door"" kind of film, but so many aspects of 'London Has Fallen' is so intelligence insulting and inept that that proved difficult for me and clearly many other reviewers.It's predecessor 'Olympus Has Fallen' was not a flawless film by any stretch of the imagination, but it at least had a little sense of fun and while indebted to 'Die Hard' it did try to not be too derivative. Its sequel 'London Has Fallen' has neither of those things and like a vastly inferior carbon copy of that film. The story has been done to death and with much more personality, thrills and excitement (three things this film is completely devoid of), further disadvantaged by very tedious pacing, constant intelligence-insulting stupidity and action scenes lacking in any kind of urgency or fun, being routine at best.'London Has Fallen' certainly can't be considered fun either, with quips that tried hard to be witty but ended up overused, misplaced and cheesy, with some of the gags being unintentional (such as calling the prime minister Clarkson). And there is the gratuitous overuse of vulgar language. The news reports were also incredibly laughable. Saying that the special effects are below-par is being far too kind, they are some of the cheapest and most amateurish special effects of any film in recent years and all of the production values here are more reminiscent of the very lowest-budget SyFy/Asylum disaster/action thriller film. The film also goes for the big and loud approach, but is so constant that there is little room to breathe and it becomes nauseating and repetitive in every way possible, and replaces logic, sense and excitement.The film also sees bad performances from actors capable of giving good performances. Gerard Butler is in a very derivative role, basically a pale variation on other heroes he's played, and struggles bringing believability to cliché ridden and stilted dialogue peppered with vulgarity that is constant and often unnecessary. He's charismatic certainly, but not very interesting. Aaron Eckhart completely phones in his performance, and while the best performance comes from Morgan Freeman he has little to do other than act remote and mildly concerned in an under-utilised role. The villain is one-dimensional and without any depth whatsoever.In summary, an awful film all round. And this is not due to American-hating, far from it (something that actually reeks of an excuse made up by defenders to try and justify why people hated a film they liked), just think that it was not a good film. 1/10 Bethany Cox",London Has Fallen
1,Leofwine_draca,Cheesy action sequel,7,17 July 2017,"London Has Fallen is the follow-up to terrorists-in-the-White-House thriller OLYMPUS HAS FALLEN, featuring returning cast members Gerard Butler, Aaron Eckhart, and Morgan Freeman. This time around the action shifts to London where the world leaders are gathered for the British Prime Minister's funeral. Before you know it, Arab terrorists have attacked and the US President becomes a hunted man.I really enjoyed OLYMPUS as it was a decent slice of cheesy fun and I was hoping for more of the same; with London Has Fallen, I got it. This is a film chock-full of errors, laughable facts, and cheesiness, but like ROBIN HOOD: PRINCE OF THIEVES I enjoyed it anyway. The British security forces are shown to be completely useless and of course Butler and Eckhart single-handedly save the day. Expect cheesy CGI explosions and helicopters that look like they belong in an Asylum movie, plus some breakneck action sequences that work very nicely. The stand-out moment is a tracking shot shoot-out in a London street which is splendid stuff and involves the viewers like few others. London Has Fallen is perfect for fans of switch-off-the-brain entertainment and I'm not ashamed to profess my enjoyment of it.",London Has Fallen
2,SnoopyStyle,slightly better this time,5,21 December 2016,"Secret Service Agent Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) considers resigning with a new baby coming. When the British Prime Minister dies, President Benjamin Asher (Aaron Eckhart) joins other western leaders for the funeral. Banning decides to stay his resignation for the unexpected trip. There is a coordinated massive attack on all the leaders. Banning is able to rescue Asher but they are continuously hounded by the terrorists led by the arms dealer Barkawi. Two years earlier, a western military strike hit his daughter's wedding party attended by his entire family.This franchise continues to be ridiculous action without being fun. They don't seem to understand that more realism would be great for this franchise. I can never buy into the situations. The Bond movies do their action with a nudge and a wink. That's not what this is. The villain is more realistic this time around. At least, they set him up better than the first movie. It doesn't mean that it passes the smell test. The believability is unable to get over the hump. It's closer this time around but no dice.",London Has Fallen
3,Prismark10,London Has Fallen,3,9 January 2020,"London Has Fallen is a bad movie simply because it sets out the entire British establishment as both incompetent and corrupt. I think Butler seems to have forgotten that he is British.The sudden death of the British Prime Minister leads to a state funeral with the world's leaders in attendance.This is all the plan of some middle eastern or is it a Pakistani arms dealing bad guy Aamir Barkawi. His people has infiltrated the police, the ambulance, the Queen's corgis and caused all kinds of mayhem on the day of the funeral. Only then it is discovered that the Prime Minister was poisoned.Once again Secret Service Agent Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) is tasked to keep the American President Benjamin Asher (Aaron Eckhart) save.Millennium Films was created by executives who worked for Cannon Films back in the 1980s. This could easily had been part of their output as it is so laced with unsubtle xenophobia.The film has a cast that includes Morgan Freeman, Angela Bassett, Jackie Earle Haley, Robert Forster and Melissa Leo and they are all wasted.There is an inept political sermon that Banning gives to the terrorist at the end of the movie. All I thought was the terrorist could respond back to him with the same speech!",London Has Fallen
4,claudio_carvalho,Non-Stop Action Film,8,3 July 2016,"The British Prime Minister is submitted to a surgery and passes away of heart attack during the recovery. The leaders of the great nations must attend his funeral without a preparation of a security scheme by their secret services. The American President Benjamin Asher (Aaron Eckhart) travels under the protection of Agent Mike Banning (Gerard Butler), who is responsible for his security. On the arrival at the St Paul's Cathedral, the leaders and the public in general have a massive attack from terrorists disguised as guards and police officers. Mike and the president succeed to flee, but soon they realize that there is no one is trustworthy. The terrorist leader promises to execute the president live for the whole world. Meanwhile the New Scotland Yard leadership comes up to the same conclusion and they activate the alarm system in the city to remove the real police officers from the streets to know who the terrorists are. Further, there is a high-level traitor in the Secret Service. Who might be the traitor? What will happen to the president and Mike? ""London Has Fallen"" is a non-stop action film with great cast, impressive special effects and scenes of destruction. The plot is well- constructed and uses the state-of-art theme of terrorist attack in Europe. The exaggeration is what viewers of action movies expect to see with a hero capable to supersede the most incredible situations. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Invasão a Londres"" (""London Invasion"")",London Has Fallen
5,nogodnomasters,We just changed the world,9,17 April 2018,"There is no real mystery in the film. A terrorist (Alon Aboutboul) who lives in rubble is also a world class arms dealer who needs to create terror and wars to sell arms. Once you get past that, we are introduced to Michael (Gerald Butler) whose job is to protect the president (Aaron Eckhart) in a formula film. When the Prime Minister of England dies, 28 head of states go to London for the funeral and to watch the special effects unfold as London is attacked both with explosions and by cyber. Only Gerald Butler can save the Prez.The production is a formula action film. There are no real twists, Aaron Eckhart was very stiff as President if not miscast. This action film has no hot Asian chicks, daring to go against the grain of recent productions. If you like action films with big explosions, good special effects, lots of gun play, and you don't have to think, this is it.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.",London Has Fallen
6,kosmasp,Don't fall for that,7,14 December 2016,"Have you seen Olympus has fallen? Did you like it? Then you are ready to watch this too. It's not that it's important to have seen it, though you will be familiar with the people involved and the characters and what they do. This still manages to start off pretty slow, until the inciting incident, which is way over the top.But you know what? So is the whole movie and the concept of it. You can read into it (America is great, this and that, in a good or bad way) or you can just enjoy a mindless piece of film. Though it will almost take until the last third of the movie before it really gets into gear. There are no prisoners to be taken, but a lot of one-liners to be delivered. Not as many and not on the level of the previous entry, but still enjoyable enough. Don't get stuck up on story or other things, because you won't be able to watch this as entertainment otherwise. And that's the only way to watch this ...",London Has Fallen
7,Sleepin_Dragon,A pile of the unmentionable.,2,30 December 2017,"I'll be honest I saw a twenty second trailer and thought this was worth a look, it starts off not too bad, then totally loses the plot, indeed there is no plot. Terrorists annihilate London to hunt down a Saintly American president, oh the irony. There are believe it or not positives, the special effects are impressive, and the scenes of an empty London look particularly eerie. The trouble is so much money went into this film it's almost heartbreaking, when you think of all the other uses for that money. A waste of resources, actors, poor Angela Bassett, if you can get to the end you'll have done well. It makes Sharknado look plausible.",London Has Fallen
8,jboothmillard,London Has Fallen,4,25 August 2019,"In the battle between Olympus Has Fallen and White House Down, both released the same year and both very similar to each other, Olympus came out on top, grossing a lot more than the other, hence a sequel followed three years later. Basically, Pakistani arms dealer Aamir Barkawi (Alon Moni Aboutboul) is the mastermind behind several terrorist attacks, intelligence services track him down and an American drone strike is made on his compound, apparently killing Barkawi and his family. Two years later, UK Prime Minister James Wilson has died, and arrangements are made for the leaders from around the world to attend his funeral in London, England. Secret Service Director Lynne Jacobs (Angela Bassett) assigns agent Mike Banning (Gerard Butler, also producing) to lead security for U.S. President Benjamin Asher (Aaron Eckhart), his close friend, even though Banning's wife Leah (Radha Mitchell) is due to give birth to their child in a few weeks. Air Force One lands at Stansted Airport, and Asher's Presidential State Car arrives at St Paul's Cathedral. A series of coordinated attacks by terrorists disguised as Metropolitan Police, the Queen's Guardsmen, and other first responders erupts, killing five Western leaders, damaging or destroying major landmarks and generating mass panic. Banning is able to rescue Asher and Jacobs and rushes them back to the Marine One, the Presidential helicopter. Terrorists follow the helicopter and escorts and fire Stinger missiles, the two escort are destroyed, while Marine One is forced to crash land in Hyde Park. Banning and Asher suffer only minor wounds, but Jacobs is fatally injured, she tells Banning to stay alive for his unborn child and get back at whoever did this. Banning escorts Asher into the London Underground while the streets of London are emptied, as people take safety in their homes. In Washington, D.C., U.S. Vice President Allan Trumbull (Morgan Freeman) works with the British authorities to track down the President and investigate the attack. Trumbull receives a call from Barkawi, who is still alive, he takes responsibility for the attacks, coordinated by his son Kamran (Waleed Zuaiter), seeking revenge for the drone strike that killed his family. Barkawi purposely had Wilson poisoned to lure the world leaders to London to attack them. Barkawi knows Asher is still alive, and promises that when he is caught, he will broadcast the execution of the President on the Internet. Trumbull orders his intelligence staff locate anybody connected with Karkari, while British authorities have all first responders stand down, to identify anyone left as terrorists to be captured or eliminated. Banning gets a sign to be picked up on satellite for a pick-up, he then leads Asher to a safe house, where Jacquelin ""Jax"" Marshall (Charlotte Riley) briefs them on what their intelligence has learned. Marshall receives a call from Trumbull that confirms they saw Banning's sign and that an extraction team is on the way. A Delta Force team is seen approaching on security monitors but Banning suspects they have arrived far too soon and may be terrorists. Banning fights against the terrorists before he and Asher drive away, but their car is struck before they can reach the U.S. Embassy, which results in Asher's kidnap. Banning is rescued by the real extraction team, a combined Delta Force and SAS squad; they also suspect that there is a mole in the British government. Trumbull's staff identify a building in London owned by one of Barkawi's companies, it is under construction and unoccupied, but is drawing massive amounts of power, it is suspected as Kamran's headquarters. Banning joins the extraction team to infiltrate the building and stop Kamran before he can kill Asher. They arrive seconds before his execution by beheading, Kamran's machete is destroyed and all his men are killed, but he escapes following a grenade explosion. Banning and Asher escape just before the building is destroyed by the Delta Force/SAS squad, killing Kamran and the remaining terrorists. Marshall working with British authorities to restore London's security system discovers that MI5 Intelligence Chief John Lancaster (Patrick Kennedy) aided in Barkawi's attack, she kills him when he reaches for a gun. Meanwhile, Trumbull contacts Barkawi to tell him that his plan failed, and then tells him to look outside as a drone strike approaches the building, Barkawi and his terrorist guards are killed in the blast. Two weeks later, Banning has returned home from London to spend time with Leah and his new-born baby girl Lynne, named after Jacobs. He sits at his computer and contemplates sending a letter of resignation, Banning deletes the letter after seeing Trumbull give an inspiring message on television. Also starring Melissa Leo as Defence Secretary Ruth Macmillan, Robert Forster as General Edward Clegg, Colin Salmon as Chief Sir Kevin Hazard and Jackie Earle Haley as Deputy Chief Mason. Butler does okay as the violent foul-mouthed hero, Eckhart is a good choice as the President and gets to kick ass a bit more than before, and other well-known names in the cast do fine as well. I agree that there nothing new or exciting to be seen here, it has predictable dialogue and silly puns, it also makes you laugh for perhaps the wrong reasons, but you can't help but go with the flow a bit when seeing famous London landmarks blowing up with terrific special effects, and the pace is good, a reasonable action thriller. Okay!",London Has Fallen
9,paul_haakonsen,Great action thriller...,7,4 September 2021,"Oddly enough, I never actually got around to watch this 2016 action thriller from writer Christian Gudegast and director Babak Najafi before now in 2021. And as it turned out, I had been missing out on an entertaining movie.The storyline told in ""London Has Fallen"" was interesting and entertaining from the very beginning and up to the very end. Sure, the ending of the movie was predictable, as they tend to be in movies such as this. But the journey from the start of the movie and up to the end was enjoyable and entertaining.There is a heap of action sequences and scenes throughout the course of the entire movie. And these action bits were so nicely choreographed and executed that it was a treat to sit through and take in. I enjoyed the action that there was in the movie quite a lot, and it carried the movie a great long way.But the storyline was also quite good. Sure, it was a bit on the simplistic side, as this was an action thriller, with emphasis on action. But it was interesting, nonetheless.""London Has Fallen"" has a good cast ensemble, with the likes of Gerard Butler, Aaron Eckhart, Morgan Freeman, and others. And the actors and actresses in the movie definitely put on good and believable performances, which helps you submerge into the story.I had been missing out on a rather enjoyable and entertaining action thriller here. If you haven't already seen it, you certainly should sit down and watch it, should you have the chance.My rating of ""London Has Fallen"" lands on a well-deserved seven out of ten stars.",London Has Fallen
10,blanche-2,"All action, all the time",7,17 September 2016,"All of these action movies with CGI, SFX, whatever, are preposterous, and ""London Has Fallen"" is no exception. Incredibly preposterous. Gerard Butler's character must be made of steel - underneath his shirt must be something with a big red S on it. Dignitaries from all over the world gather in London for the London Prime Minister's funeral. As usual, precautions have been taken for the President's (Aaron Eckhart) by his top agent, Mike Banning, and his Secret Service Director Lynne Jacobs (Angela Bassett).However, the world leaders have walked into a trap and terrorists initiate a surprise attack and not only kill heads of state but decimate buildings and tear up the streets. Mike manages to get the President out of there and finally onto a chopper that will take him, Lynn, and the President to Air Force One, but their escape is far from over.That's really all there is to it, lots of shooting, more dead bodies than you've ever seen, grenades, a run through a subway station, car chases - nonstop.It's quite exciting if you pay no attention to how unrealistic it is or the underdeveloped characters. This is the type of film that is a big money-maker for the studios as they can show it to 13-year-olds in Thailand, who will mob the theater.In one way it's a shame that this is what big films are now - cartoon characters (which used to be B movies), franchises, special effects, and remakes. But that's what happens when people who only care about money take over a studio. You may say, well, all the big Hollywood moguls cared about money, and that's true. But they cared about movies too.",London Has Fallen
11,Quinoa1984,"""This man has killed more people than the plague."" - Vice President Morgan Freeman, said with a straight, unironic, this-is-true face",4,17 December 2016,"I actually kind of enjoyed Olympus Has Fallen, as a guilty pleasure but also a s a pure hard-boiled don't-give-a-f*** action flick. It was mindless and ultra-violent, but it had a solid cast that was used with energy (Melissa Leo! Robert Forster! Uh, who else, right, Angela Basset!). They all are back for London Has Fallen (some of them get lines, some seem to only stand up or sit down depending on the emotion of a scene), and the plot here is probably more incredibly/ludicrous than the first movie - a funeral for the recently deceased prime minister (which we learn was planned for years since it was, dun-dun-dun, not an accident like they first thought!) - as a number of world leaders are killed all at once in a plan that might seem out of The Dark Knight (so it may be plausible to some, not to others), and Mike Banning and President Asher (Butler and Eckhardt, with enough chiseled features for a monument) are now on the run from the kind of scenario that turns London into either a) Fallujah, or b) a setting closer to one of the Escape from NY movies. Everyone is out to get the man getting the president out of harms way! This movie, unlike the first one, is simply sheer insanity. I see that the director, Babak Najafi, and so one is tempted to see this as a satire in red-blooded dumb-as-a-block-of-motherf***ing-bricks action 'flick' you and your pops can put on with a 24 pack of beer on a Sunday afternoon clothing. But considering his past credits - a Joel Kinnaman direct to video feature, Easy Money II: Hard to Kill (wait, they did a sequel to the Rodney Dangerfield movie?) and episodes of Banshee, I'm not sure there is any sign of him being more than a gun for hire who might have had some feel or flair for the middle-eastern settings, which are shown a couple of times. Perhaps if I were watching this a dozen times over the course of a week I might find some deeper meanings to all of this, but I don't have time for rational solutions! Seeing this the once, I found this to have a lot of action that was equal parts rather routine (lots and lots of gun fire, often from assault rifles) and rather nuts (the way Butler uses a knife at times, at one point to climb his way up an enemy, is wild).So there are things here that make this also a guilty pleasure viewing. But at the same time it's also racist - ""Go back to f***istan"" is one line Butler throws out, like the good-totally-shameless exploitation figure he is here - and there's also a glee in the bloodshed and the sort of brawny, mindless explosions and carnage that a few times are very funny (the way an explosion happens in the climax, which one may have seen lots of times before, with characters running and managing to evade at the last possible moment ala the dog in Independence Day is an example), but at the same time there's implausible things all about. I'm glad I watched this at home due to how much I found myself yelling at the TV ""No, they're DEAD now!"" as far as the number of times our heroes should be killed, whether in a helicopter or in a car crash or in an explosion or a grenade, etc, but manage to make it out with maybe a scratch or two. Well, actually, one character doesn't make it out, and this particular one gets the kind of send off that would be funnier if we hadn't seen this in a thousand other movies.So is it clever and subversive because its director happens to be from the same region (albeit he's Iranian and the movie's villains are from Yemen - they're pretty careful to *not* mention Islam, by the way, whether it's the opening drone attack or anything after), or is it the sort of Dumb and potentially (or simply just) offensive action porn that should have starred Sylvester Stallone in the Banning part. Oh what, he's too old? Who needs youth when you body slam terrorist through floors and stab them like you're MACHETE - which, by the way, would be a full two stars higher if it had been a Trejo/Rodriguez flick instead?",London Has Fallen

15,zardoz-13,A Good Carbon Copy Sequel,8,6 March 2016,"Although neither as ambitious nor as surprising as Antoine Fuqua's ""Olympus Has Fallen"" (2013), the sequel ""London Has Fallen"" qualifies as a good, old-fashioned, slam-bang, action thriller that should appeal to anybody who craved ""The Expendables"" movies. ""300"" star Gerard Butler reprises his role as indestructible, straight-shooting Secret Service Agent Mike Banning, and he bais U.S. President Ben Asher's butt out of another predictable, but electrifying predicament as terrorists swarm around them like furious hornets. A quartet of scenarists, Christian Gudegast of ""Beyond the City Limits"" and Chad St. John of ""The Punisher, Dirty Laundry"" co-scripted with ""Olympus"" creators Creighton Rothenberger & Katrin Benedikt who also came up with the story, has shifted the setting from Washington, D.C., to London, England. The chief difference here is our hero, who claims to be made out of ""bourbon and bad choices,"" takes seemingly sadistic pleasure in torturing the trigger-happy villains. Squeamish spectators are duly warned because this occurs more than once. In Hollywood movies, the heroes are given special dispensation to torment homicidal terrorists as often as heartless Nazis and other intolerant racist dastards. Banning stabs one terrorist to death slowly and lets the terrorist's ruthless brother at the other end of a cell phone listen to his sibling die in agony. Indeed, Banning displays minimal emotion when turning terrorists into sieves with one kind of weapon or another. Some of them Banning dispatches at long range with an assault rifle and others at close range with his pistol. Iranian-born Swedish director Babak Najafi, who helmed ""Easy Money 2: Hard to Kill,"" gives neither the heroes nor the villains the luxury to loiter in this tense, nail-biting, 100-minute melodrama that corners our good guys from the get-go and doesn't let them relax until the final quarter hour. Mind you, nothing about ""London Has Fallen"" is remotely believable, and the characters are all one-dimensional. Banning is the only one to change over time; he becomes a father by fade-out. Once they arrive in London, the entire story elapses in less than 24 hours. Nevertheless, Butler's gutsy performance as an audacious hero who doesn't stop shooting until he runs out of lead, a brawny as well as believable cast, and the scenic city on the River Thames are its best assets.Unlike the rogue North Koreans who manufactured the mayhem in ""Olympus Has Fallen,"" vengeance-driven Middle Eastern terrorists plan the pandemonium in ""London Has Fallen."" Affluent arms merchant Aamir Barkawi (Alon Aboutboul of ""Rambo 3"") and his eldest son Kamran (Waleed Zuaiter of ""Jihad"") orchestrate payback for a Pentagon drone strike that missed them, but killed their sister at her wedding in Pakistan. Miraculously, Aamir and Kamran survived the devastation. The Pentagon bombing takes place two years before the anarchy erupts in ""London."" News of the death of British Prime Minister Jim Wilson brings foreign heads of state to London to attend Wilson's funeral. Banning and Secret Service Director Lynne Jacobs (Angela Bassett of ""Innocent Blood"") accompany President Asher. We are given glimpses of several other heads of state in London in route to Wilson's funeral. No sooner than the Americans arrive at St. Paul's Cathedral do the terrorists launch their strike. Fanatics masquerading as British police as well as the red-uniformed Queen's Guard open fire on the German Chancellor. One foreign dignitary is blown up in his car after a terrorist disguised as a policeman attaches a bomb with a device used to search under vehicles. Asher is standing on the steps of St. Paul conversing with a member of the Prime Minister's cabinet when the fusillade of gunfire surprises everybody. Only a moment before the debacle, Agent Mike Banning complained that something wasn't right, but he couldn't decide what bothered him. Banning hustles the President into their bulletproof SUV, and they careen toward the Presidential choppers on the ground with terrorists on bikes strafing their vehicle. Terrorists kill the SUV driver, but Banning, Asher, and Jacobs make it to the choppers. London landmarks explode during this bedlam. The Marine choppers make it aloft. Terrorists wielding surface to air missiles demolish all three helicopters. Miraculously, Banning, Asher, and Jacob survive the crash of their chopper. The action focuses on Banning and Asher as more terrorists on bikes assemble around the crash site, and they have to leave Jacobs behind. Eventually, Banning and Asher reach an MI-6 safe house, but the rescue team that Vice President Alan Trumbull (Morgan Freeman of ""The Shawshank Redemption"") sends in doesn't make it. Instead, a bogus bunch reach Asher and Banning and storm the safe house. Our heroes careen off in another bulletproof car. Naturally, Mike Banning leads a charmed life, and he brings down more than his share of terrorists. At times, the shoot-outs in ""London"" resemble a high body count Hong Kong action-thriller.""Olympus Has Fallen"" was released roughly twelve years after the 9/11 tragedy, and the filmmakers tapped into the terrible memory of that event. Director Babak Najafi started shooting ""London Has Fallen"" in October 2014, and filming concluded in February 2015 before the horrific Paris massacre made headlines in November 2015. Although it takes place in a different city under different circumstances, ""London Has Fallen"" derives a modicum of plausibility from the Paris massacre as ""Olympus"" did from 9/11. Unlike ""Olympus"" that exploited that anxiety, ""London"" foreshadowed it. Some commentators' have contended cynically that the producers could forge a franchise from this formula with Banning and Asher visiting other capitals and encountering disorder. Compared to ""Olympus,"" ""London"" is far less ambitious. Several actors and actresses along with Butler have recreated their roles for ""London,"" and one of them bites the dust. This character's demise is the only genuine surprise. The President mentions his son in this sequel, but we never get to see him. Basically, Banning and Asher stomp the ground in ""London."" Although it carbon copies the formula from ""Olympus Has Fallen,"" ""London Has Fallen"" generates considerable suspense and ranks as an above-average urban action thriller.",London Has Fallen

18,neil-476,Brainless popcorn action - industrial quantities of it,6,4 March 2016,"Assorted world leaders collect in London for a state funeral. Unfortunately, it transpires that an enormous group of terrorists has also collected in London and, posing as emergency services, they destroy vast quantities of London, cut off communications, and manage to kill all the heads of state and a large number of innocent civilians. All, that is, except US President Asher and his chief security operative Mike Banning, now best buddies after the events of Olympus Has Fallen a couple of years ago. And Asher is the very bloke the terrorists are after – they want to execute him live on the internet – so Banning starts doing his thing in a London which appears to be almost deserted.Dear me, this is tosh. So was its predecessor, but the things which seem slightly ridiculous in the relatively small context of the White House seems preposterous in the context of a city like London. I don't mean the destroying of landmarks – 9/11 showed us that was all too easy – I mean the apparent absence of any security protocols to deal with terrorists posing as emergency services, contingencies to deal with the failure of CCTV and telecommunications generally.And I'm not even going to address Banning killing terrorists with nearly every shot while none of the terrorists could hit a barn door, If you like action, there is truckloads of it here. The London location work is pleasing, although some of the filming is so jittercammed that you can't tell whether the geography is right or not. The token attempts at humanising the apparently indestructible Banning are pointless – trying to construct jeopardy over whether he will survive or not is irrelevant when every frame of film shows you that these terrorists couldn't scratch him no matter how hard they tried. And that is probably the main flaw of this movie – there's nothing at stake, really, apart from CGI destruction of landmarks.Gerard Butler flings out a few one-liners and looks hard. Aaron Eckhard is a principled POTUS, and Morgan Freeman oozes dignified gravitas to the extent that she should be President really, not Eckhard.This is a genuinely brainless popcorn movie.",London Has Fallen
19,Uriah43,Totally Divorced from Reality,1,27 October 2016,"Although this film's predecessor, ""Olympus Has Fallen"" was extremely unrealistic, I had hope that this sequel would be an improvement. Unfortunately, I was wrong as this proved to be a film that--despite the good cast and nice sets--was totally divorced from reality. Essentially, due to the unexpected death of the British Prime Minister, the President of the United States, ""Benjamin Asher"" (Aaron Eckhart) decides to travel to London for the funeral--as does just about every other important national head-of-state. Naturally, security is of the utmost concern. However, when the President eventually arrives he is greeted by more terrorists than anybody can possibly imagine and they have an uncanny ability to follow him everywhere he turns. Not only that, but the entire security apparatus of Great Britain is either completely riddled with terrorists or totally incapable of dealing with them. Again, there wasn't much realism here but apparently that didn't matter because there was plenty of action. Now, if this had been a comedy I could deal with some of these ludicrous scenarios. However, absent that fact and given the complete lack of the necessary realism required for a picture of this type, I have to rate this movie as I see it. It was just plain awful.",London Has Fallen
20,anaconda-40658,London Falls Hard.,2,8 April 2016,"London Has Fallen (2016): Dir: Babak Najafi / Cast: Gerard Butler, Aaron Eckhart, Morgan Freeman, Alon Moni Aboutboul, Angela Bassett: First Olympus fell, and now London has fallen. They are stuck within a screenplay that is even less sturdy. A terrorist group loses their minds again and decide to target everything in sight so to gain some nitwit media threat. Gerard Butler returns as top secret agent whose wife is expecting a baby. She is also expecting her husband to run off to London with the president to kick ass. The character is a xerox of every other secret agent this side of 007. The one difference being that this particular one is on the boring end. Aaron Eckhart totally phones it in as the president. He talks big and pretends to care in hopes that viewers will relate but it is all horse crap. Morgan Freeman is another waste as vice president. His job is to chat in meetings, chat to a screen featuring the terrorist, and make lame speeches that uphold America while positioning every other country as pretty much nothing. Alon Moni Aboutboul plays the typical terrorist thug that talks sh*t before time arrives for his ass to get handed to him. Angela Bassett is also wasted as an agent contact. The production values are top notch with explosive action throughout but the screenplay is nothing more than one beat down after another. Director Babak Najafi handles the action well but above that this film is a pointless piece of crap. Instead of London falling, why not place this film some place where a large rock can fall on it and mash it into the pathetic nothing that it is. Score: 2 / 10",London Has Fallen
21,FlashCallahan,Would the other one have been called Downing Street Down?,7,8 March 2016,"After the British Prime Minister passes away after what appears to be complications following a routine operation, his funeral becomes a target of a terror plot.The plan is to destroy some of the world's most powerful leaders, devastate the British capital, and unleash a terrifying vision of the future. The only hope of stopping it rests on the shoulders of the President of the United States and his formidable, Die Hard loving Secret Service head, and an English MI-6 agent who rightly trusts no one..........Apart from Tom Hardy, because she married him in real life.I didn't care much for Olympus Has Fallen, it was a cardboard cut out Die Hard Wannabe which just happened to be set in the White House, and to be honest, I much preferred White House Down, because it was aware of its own stupidity.So in the year that appears to be the years of totally unnecessary sequels (see also Bad Santa 2, Kindergarten Cop 2, The Huntsman), this is one of the first, and one of the most intriguing to me, because the synopsis is so high concept, you'd think Golan and Globus were in the house.And while the film isn't good, terribly racist, patriotic on the verge of parody, it isn't the terrible disaster you'd believe considering the plethora of bad reviews.I liked it because I was brought up on a diet of macho, patriotic schtick that used to feature an all American hero, an Uzi, and usually lots and lots of denim. Basically London Has Fallen is the film that The Cannon Group never made in the eighties. And believe me, if you are a fan of films like Invasion U.S.A, Death Wish 4, and Toy Soldiers, you will find much to enjoy/laugh at in this film.Butler is at his most macho here. He's not the greatest actor in the world, so he lets his weapons do the talking. Although he does look constipated for half of the film, he does convince as an action star.........just.He rest of the cast are great, but they are all phoning in their performances. Freeman is definitely not in that scene with Butler, Bassett gives up about thirty minutes in, and I spent more time looking at Forsters comb forward than listening to him.The effects are exceptionally bad, but only add to the charm of its absurdity. But watching it, no matter how thrilling some of the set pieces are, you know that him and the President will be safe, he'll get home to see his new born, and that resignation will be deleted forever.Coming next, box office has fallen.......",London Has Fallen
22,phd_travel,Exciting from start to finish - WOW!,10,3 March 2016,"Hands down the most exciting thriller in years. The pace is just right and the story is well laid out by establishing the reason for the attack by taking out the the arms dealer in the beginning. Things move quickly from DC to London where rather tongue in cheek humor shows the different heads of state including a woman for Germany and an older man with a young lady/ mistress for Italy. The action is very well done. Nothing deja vu here. You've get everything here. Firstly the disaster sequences are well done - not fake looking because they aren't over the top, from car bombs to bridges and Westminster Abbey blown up to boats exploding. The helicopter sequence is outstanding and quite scary. Then there are some pretty impressive fight scenes that are brisk and fresh. The street fighting scenes are almost video game like but entertaining. Finally even though you know the outcome, the threat of online beheading is quite scary.Gerard Butler is surprisingly right for the role - believable in his action and convincing in his determination. He acts like someone who could pull it off and delivers some snappy one liners. Aaron Eckhart plays the President who can handle a weapon. Good support from Angela Bassett and of course Morgan Freeman is the Vice President. Charlotte Riley handles things on the British side and she is not too glamorous to be unrealistic.There may be a bit of political incorrectness in the way there the ""terrorists"" are dispatched rapidly and in large quantities. But that's the nature of this type of movie and there are white villains too. The director is of Iranian descent and does a terrific job.Well done - much better than ""Olympus Has Fallen"".",London Has Fallen

What worked: The beginning drone strike grabs the viewers attention. Implausible, (unbelievable) attacks but still exciting. Buttler has some good alpha male moments. What did not work: The arms dealer storyline is unbelievable. Buttler's wife/child character development scenes drag the storyline and add nothing to it. Many of the secondary characters come across flat. The director could not create the energy and passion of the first film. Regrettably, the first instalment used up most of the good material. Took the money and ran with part two. Still watchable. Reminds me of the Die-hard series.",London Has Fallen

I knew that it was going to be one of those exaggerated action movies. But every now and then I watch blockbusters like this one, just to kill some time. A movie where you don't have to think too much, where you know before it begins how it will end. But with London Has Fallen I think we reach a point of complete ridicule. I think I was speaking out loud every minute of the movie. And not in a good way. The amount of time things happen that are completely impossible are too much to count. I'm not even going to spend some words about all the clichés you get in London Has Fallen. It is probably one of the worst action movies with well known actors I ever saw. I could not wait for this movie to end. One thing is for sure, if they make a third movie like this one I'm going to pass on that one.",London Has Fallen
25,SimonJack,Good twist raises this above standard terrorism films,7,15 August 2017,"""London Has Fallen"" is a terrorism film with a novel plot that raises it above the standard Hollywood fare of the genre. The setting in London, with a plot to take out several world leaders. The complex operation has lots of action with associated pyrotechnics, special effects and stunt routines. Considerable CGI is used to show British landmarks exploding. The cast all are good in this action thriller. Terrorist films were almost unknown before the 1960s. The few that were made mostly were about individual acts of terrorism. The most common of those was a rash of airplane hijackings into the 1970s. But since the rise of global terrorism by organized groups, mostly from the Middle East and Asia, Hollywood began to make movies around the new understanding of terrorists. Since the mid-1990s, a new terrorism movie has come out about every year or two. Still, it's surprising that there haven't been more, especially where terrorist groups have been exposed or hunted down. This has happened with government operations in several countries. Most notable have been the U.S., England and France. The public appeal seems mixed from the films that have been made. It could be that much of the public doesn't want to be reminded of the real horror of terrorism that takes place somewhere around the world nearly every week. One can't imagine why governments wouldn't want films made about their efforts and methods in finding and taking down terrorist forces. It would seem to be a reassurance and calming factor for the public. So, there may be other reasons why Hollywood hasn't explored this genre in more depth and with more films.",London Has Fallen
26,siderite,Funny to see this on the day of the Brexit: Merkel's revenge!,7,24 June 2016,"The movie is what you expect it to be, only waaaay over the top. Big explosions, death everywhere and a city of London where you can drive at high speed or run through the streets and find no one, because the air sirens were sounded. More like they all fled to the EU!Anyway, the film starts with a drone strike on a wedding of the family of an infamous arms dealer. Not only does he not die, but neither does his family, except women and children and such. The destruction of all of London's landmarks and the death of all the G8 leaders is his revenge. It was funny, it almost felt like the speech at the end ""we are not just a building, just a flag, just a single man"" was more pointed to the makers of movies like these, where the point seems to be to blow landmarks up and then play 3D shooting games.Other than what I have described there is nothing really there. The entire thing feels like a computer game: maps that seem to only care about the places where you can shoot at each other, ridiculous reasons for not advancing to the next level and, of course, walking in a hale of bullets and not getting hit once. The only parts where Banning is hurt he shrugs it off, like a game character that after the obligatory ""Ugh!"" loses 10% health.There is a toll paid by all of us when film makers today are the people who only played shoot'em-ups in their youth. Blood and gore disabled, of course.",London Has Fallen
27,StevePulaski,A film that simply cannot help but be what it is,4,7 March 2016,"It's been a good three years and the R-rated, action-packed ""Olympus Has Fallen"" has faded from most minds, even the consumers who saw the film such as myself. However, that's not going to stop Gerard Butler, Aaron Eckhart, and Morgan Freeman from returning to stop a band of heavily armed terrorists, who have blown every historic landmark in the British capital to smithereens, by instilling the insurmountable power of the red, white, and blue up their asses like they're Red Foreman after a bad Fourth of July cookout.This time, however, instead of America being under attack, London is the target for a series of numerous bombings and strategic attacks during the time a funeral for the British Prime Minister is underway. Both President Benjamin Asher (Aaron Eckhart) and his top Secret Service agent Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) are present during the time of the attack, just as they arrive to the Prime Minster's funeral. A fury of gunfire and explosions occur, including a suspension bridge exploding, leaving five world leaders dead. All of this is the work of Aamir Barkawi (Alon Aboutboul), a terrorist with intent to bring the war to the places that start the wars; destroy the homes and communities of people who passively do the same to other places around the world without thinking twice.""London Has Fallen,"" at the very least, manages to pack some gritty entertainment into its premise because it boasts an R-rating confidently, not at all worried or phase by the possibilities of not being a marketable picture. This is the same reason that ""Olympus Has Fallen"" was better than it could've been; when an action film owns an R-rating instead of a PG-13, not only does it open up the possibility for more dialog that's realistic given the situations, but it also helps show a whirlwind more when it comes to the action sequences. ""London Has Fallen,"" as a result, turns its action sequences into some of the strongest I've seen since ""Final Destination 5,"" in terms of visual clarity and sheer intensity.During the entire terrorist attack sequence, I was thoroughly enjoying the film as fairly basic but competent entertainment. Despite a strong opening, however, the film has little to offer once the second act kicks in, and by the time the third act goes for sentiment and a hard-hitting moral about how America's involvement in near every foreign facet is the key to the country's strengths, I not only stopped caring, but I tried to stop listening. While I won't be one of the people to claim a New World Order agenda embedded within the screenplay of a new action film, I will be the one to claim that the personal politics, in addition to the lunacy between Butler and Eckhart throughout the whole film, work to take a simple, effective premise and effectively limit its potential by making it silly and overreaching.""London Has Fallen"" doesn't need to be a political sermon, but it sure wants to be. It doesn't need to be a story about a family man looking to turn in his badge for a safer, more comfortable life, but it sure wants to be. And, finally, it doesn't need to be a carbon copy of its predecessor, but it can't help but be. Even a slew of hard-hitting action sequences and beautifully rendered special effects cannot save the film from itself, and that is the biggest, most personal flaw of all.",London Has Fallen
28,KineticSeoul,"Lower quality when it comes to the story, but better action.",7,16 June 2016,"A lot of critics seems like the first one compared to this sequel. I personally liked both equally. And it's because despite the first one having a better set up, build up and overall better story. This one backs it up with better action sequences that actually stands out. The problem is, despite this having a lower budget compared to the previous one. It tries to go in a more bigger scale with more explosions and special effects. Which means there is downgrades when it comes to the special effects. But it didn't go so far as to take me out of the whole experience. Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) is basically the Punisher in this. He is this badass tough bodyguard that is ruthless when it comes to taking down the bad guys. He does what it takes to accomplish his mission and is willing to really get his hands dirty to do it. If I wanted a human bodyguard it would have to be this guy. But yeah the action sequences is more entertaining to watch this time around. It's not worth buying a ticket to go see it in a theater unless it's a dollar theater.

29,sddavis63,Lots Of Action But A Really Silly Story,4,15 April 2018,"Gerard Butler was called back into service as Secret Service agent Mike Banning, in this sequel to the movie ""Olympus Has Fallen."" It's much the same story - Banning has to protect the US president from a bunch of bad guys. In this case it's stereotypical Middle Eastern terrorists who are the villains. To state the positive first - if the only thing you care about in a movie is action, then ""London Has Fallen"" works. Once the terrorist attack (or attacks) start - this doesn't lose steam. It just keeps going and going and going like its on steroids. But personally I like even an action story to be at least semi-coherent; a little bit logical; to have a bit of a believable story. On those points, this one fails big time - and it all fails because of what I can only interpret as American jingoism on the part of the movie makers.The basic story revolves around a trip by the US President (again played by Aaron Echkart, as in ""Olympus ..."") to London at attend the funeral of the British Prime Minister. Banning - who wants to take time off because of the impending birth of his first child - gets drafted to accompany him. What could go wrong on a trip to London anyway? As it turns out - a lot, and here's where it falls apart. The British - MI6, Scotland Yard and pretty much everybody else - come across as dunces. Seriously - they have leaders from all over the world in their city and we're expected to believe that this could happen? There wasn't only a terrorist attack - there were multiple terrorist attacks, killing leaders and taking down iconic landmarks in the city. It was 9/11 times 10. And then we were supposed to believe that somehow the terrorists had so completely infiltrated the British police that there wasn't only a mole near the top - even many if not most of the officers on the ground were a part of this attack. And then we're expected to believe that on British soil the British military is going to start looking helplessly to Mike Banning for instructions on what to do and how to handle this. Seriously? I mean - seriously?On the seriousness scale, this movie falls completely apart. Lots of good action - and lots of excitement - but I just couldn't buy into most of what I saw happening on screen.

This one is set on the streets of London; where Secret Service 'super agent' Mike Banning is once again defending President Benjamin Asher, from vicious terrorists. Gerard Butler, Aaron Eckhart, Morgan Freeman, Angela Bassett, Melissa Leo, Robert Forster, Radha Mitchell and Sean O'Bryan all reprise their roles (from the original film); they're joined by newcomers Alon Moni Aboutboul, Waleed Zuaiter, Mehdi Dehbi, Charlotte Riley (Tom Hardy's wife) and Jackie Earle Haley. Screenwriters Creighton Rothenberger and Katrin Benedikt once again co-wrote the movie (they also co-scripted 'THE EXPENDABLES 3'), along with Christian Gudegast and Chad St. John. Iranian- Swedish filmmaker Babak Najafi made his American film debut, directing the movie (replacing Antoine Fuqua, from the original). I really enjoyed this film!The British Prime Minister has passed away, and all the western world leaders are invited to his funeral (in London). Mike Banning (Butler), the toughest secret service agent that ever lived, is once again escorting President Asher (Eckhart). Hundreds of armed mercenaries, under the command of a ruthless terrorist (Aboutboul), attack everyone in attendance; killing several world leaders, slaughtering hundreds of civilians and destroying multiple London landmarks. Banning will stop at nothing, to get the President out of there alive.The movie is such a great throwback to the B-action flicks of yesteryear (especially the 80s and early 90s); back when almost everything was a 'DIE HARD' ripoff! I was so surprised at how brutally violent it is. Butler seems like he stepped out of a time machine, to play his 'badass' role! The movie is filled with cheesy dialogue, weak special effects and completely unbelievable action scenarios; but it's also relentlessly entertaining in the process. I enjoyed it a lot more than the original (and 'WHITE HOUSE DOWN' as well).

Its remake a few months later, White House Down, was just plain awful. And now we have a sequel no one asked for and after the final product, no one should've seen. Good news! Barely anyone did see this travesty. For an only 99-minute movie, it felt like three hours. The opening setup was way too long, the following *insert film title sequence here* scene contained too many incredibly bad CGI attacks and the finale felt like one cheap video game you'd return to Redbox in less than a day. Additionally, this 90s throwback was so predicable with fake heart-felt ""save the President"" gasps, speeches and slo-mo's, it didn't even work as an homage to the 90s action movies I love so much. Hell, even the worst season of 24 was 24x better than this.Basically, London's Prime Minister easily dies and everyone but the surprisingly smart Russian President attends the funeral. Gees, nothing bad could come of this. Yada, yada, yada, Presidential Protector Banning goes through the comical motions of saving the President.If the both the CGI and bad guys weren't so generic and underwhelming, it might be a so-bad-it's-fun flick. I never felt I was watching an action movie or a film where anyone really gave a damn. Skip it. ***Final thoughts: I really had a ton of fun with the first movie. Just see that one.

But then he finds himself travelling with the president to England, after the unexpected death of the British Prime Minister, for his state funeral. Even with tight security in place, Zuaiter manages to hatch his plot for revenge, plummeting the entire city into chaos and forcing Banning and Asher to dash off and somehow save the day.I didn't happen to think the original Olympus Has Fallen was really any great shakes. In fact, I was one of the few people to prefer 2013's other White House in peril actioner White House Down to that film. Yet, when this sequel rolled by, I must have been taken by it being set in the capital city of my home country, and seeing if there was a possibility of improvement in quality with if the action was transferred to my shores. With the country on high alert, meaning the type of destruction portrayed in the film being committed by ISIS is 'highly likely', it seems a bit of a gamble to get it released.It opens with some potential, but it soon descends into the kind of stupidity that, if I remember rightly, I didn't like the original for. From a nonsensical start to the action, with a group of police officers and other personnel turning out to be bad guys (despite the security checks that must've taken place!), it has soon lost all sense of credibility. All the characters, from Banning to the president, display patronizing and unrealistic displays of selflessness in the face of personal danger that make them cartoonish, whilst the action sequences not only maintain their level of ridiculousness, but also are shot in such a blurred, frenzied way, that they hold no degree of tension or excitement whatsoever. And Butler is still unable to pull off a convincing, subtle one liner.Usually, I'd give the follow up to a film I didn't like much the widest berth imaginable, so imagine my frustration when this turned out to be even worse than the original. *",London Has Fallen
33,bowmanblue,London 'fell' (and no one really noticed),6,25 January 2017,"I remember watching 'Olympus Has Fallen' with absolutely no expectations whatsoever. It was basically 'Die Hard set in the White House' – a brainless (but fun) kill-the-bad-guys type movie where you knew exactly what was going to happen, but enjoyed the ride anyway. I'm guessing that a fair few other people must have also enjoyed it, hence here comes the sequel Here, the same fearless (and borderline indestructible) presidential security guard is in London for a funeral, only for dastardly terrorists to stage a coup involving impersonating – seemingly – the entire Metropolitan police force (no, seriously) and threatening to assassinate the President (if they can find him). Luckily, Gerard Butler is on hand to keep him safe (and hidden, which, even in London, is apparently harder than it sounds!).What we have here is a typical 'action sequel' where it thinks that 'bigger' is generally better. Whereas the first film was tense and confined to the White House (arguably one of the most impenetrable buildings ever – and therefore hard to escape from) this one is set across an entire city. Expect the mandatory shoot-outs and car chases, all of which are designed to outdo its predecessor. However, what it has in increased explosions, it lacks in overall tension and feel.From being quite a good, little action film (reminiscent of action films of old, ala Die Hard and Commando) this one just plays it by the numbers. Despite some reasonable acting talent on offer here, everyone seems to be going through the motions. There's not an awful lot you can say about it. It has bad-guys. They're trying to do bad things. A goodie has to stop them. Expect bloodshed along the way. It isn't bad, it's just not as good as the original and therefore you'll probably forget it the moment the credits rolled.

This is actually true about the film as well. It's an action thriller with a pace of bombings, gun fights, and other means of having people killed that exceeds by at least one degree of magnitude everything that you have recently seen on screens.The film starts with a targeted assassination. It's a wedding taking place somewhere in the Orient (maybe Pakistan). The whole family is gathered, father and sons for the wedding of the daughter when the guided bomb explodes. The targeted person was the master terrorist Aamir Barkawi (played by an Israeli actor expert in such roles - Alon Aboutboul). He survives, but many collateral victims including his daughter die. Two years later he takes revenge by staging a high profile terror attack in London which practically liquidates almost all the leadership of the free world. The stake is however even higher - the execution on live TV in ISIS style of the president of the United States. Of course, the plan will fail, but many people will die before the 95 minutes of screening end.The targeted assassination is the only hint about the possible reasons of the attacks, and even this is some how trivializing, as terror has deeper and darker roots. It is not this film that will clarify any of these, as the goal of Iranian-born director Babak Najafi and of the authors of the script was just to create patriotic American entertainment around the events. On this specific track they did succeed, as the pace is alert, the action keeps interest high for the fans of the genre, all provided that you accept the premises of the film. Some of the effects are spectacular, London never looked so much in ruin since the blitz. Acting is efficient within its limited scope borders, with Morgan Freeman wasting (again) his huge talent, and Gerard Butler and Aaron Eckhart competing on the number of terrorist shot dead and on the squareness of their respective chins.Action thrillers of this kind were riding high in the 1980s with folks like Chuck Norris enjoying their moments of glory. Two things have happened since then: special effects highly improved and terror has become part of the daily news reality and part of life (to say so) in the big cities of the world.

The film brings back just about the entire cast from the first installment and pits them up against a new threat, this time it's global. The Prime Minister dies under mysterious circumstances which brings plenty of the world's leaders to his funeral. While there, Mike Banning discovers the plot to kill the president and the other leaders. We then get virtually the same plot as the first film just with the backdrop of London instead of the White House.Sadly, it doesn't really take advantage of the great cast that it assembled. Unlike the first film, Morgan Freeman and Melissa Leo are just faces in a group of people with little lines to work with. We do however, get the same fun dynamic between Aaron Eckhart and Gerard Butler to keep us entertained. Eckhart once again proved he's a solid choice to play the president and this type of role is where Butler thrives. He gets far more to do than he did in Gods of Egypt, and I'm grateful for that. He's once again debating quitting the secret service based on his soon to be fatherhood duties before being thrust back into the fray in London.The motivations of the villains here don't seem to be as fleshed out as the first film and thus creating weak character development. The film is also just as pro-American as the first outing which can turn off some for sure. In all, there's nothing really new here with this story or execution. Besides from a few cool long takes towards the end of the film, the action is generic and hindered by overuse of shaky-cam. The actors are stuck with a less than sub-par script that doesn't do much of anything unique. But with all that said, it's hard not to at least enjoy Butler and Eckhart having fun with their characters in this bombastic sequel.+Butler & Eckhart+Some good long takes of action-Derivative-Doesn't flesh out its villains-Wastes the talent of its actors5.8/10",London Has Fallen

37,cosmo_tiger,This is a movie that I highly recommend and is one you could watch over and over. One of the best action movies of the year,8,13 June 2016,"""Vengeance must always be profound and absolute."" After the death of the Prime Minister of England President Asher (Eckhart) and secret service agent Mike Banning (Butler) travel to London for the funeral. While there a precisely coordinated terrorist attack is carried out and many other world leaders are killed. Banning must once again protect the President, but this time the stakes are higher than they have ever been, and losing him would result in global chaos. I wasn't all that excited about this one. I liked White House Down more than Olympus Has Fallen. It may have been because I saw White House Down first but I liked the comedy aspect of it more than the Die Hard like Olympus Has Fallen. That being said I sat down to watch this with low expectations. That saidthis movie blew all my expectations away. The movie is action packed, entertaining, edge of your seat inducing and extremely fast paced. So fast that when it ended I had to double check the time. On its own this is just a great action movie this is fun and exciting to watch. Compared to the other movies this is easily the best of the three. This is a movie that I highly recommend and is one you could watch over and over. Overall, one of the best action movies of the year. Thrilling and intense. I loved it. I give this an A.",London Has Fallen
38,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,3,5 June 2016,"London Has FallenTo get the upper hand on terrorism we need to employ the use of suicide bomber-hostages.However, the high-level hostage in this action movie isn't likely to be allowed to wear an explosive vest.In London for the Prime Minister's funeral, US President Asher (Aaron Eckhart) and his bodyguard Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) are caught in a terrorist plot to wipeout all world leaders in attendance and kidnap Asher for online execution.Across the pond, the US vice-president (Morgan Freeman) works with White House staff to solve the mystery behind the mastermind's (Alon Moni Aboutboul) motives and the possibility of a mole.Overstuffed with straightforward shootouts, commonplace car chases and patriotic orations, this unwarranted sequel to Olympus Has Fallen is even more bombastic and nationalistic. With Butler's brutish performance and xenophobic one-liners as its highest and lowest points.Besides, you'd get more online traffic executing that hunky Canadian Prime Minister.

39,851222,Poor flick,5,7 August 2016,"Greetings from Lithuania.""London Has Fallen"" (2015) is a very poor sequel to a much superior action thriller ""Olympus Has Fallen"" (2013). It has nothing that made first movie at least fun ""Die Hard"" in a White House clone. Although action sequences were OK, script is beyond predictable and one note. There isn't anything that would resemble any character development, and at running time 1 h 20 min it is a shamefully short on running time, but being this poor, i kinda enjoyed that it ended. Overall, you can safely skip ""London Has Fallen"" because it is a straight to DVD kinda flick with many good names in acting department attached, but it is very poor written movie. You think writing doesn't matter for a brain-dead action shoot-em-up flick? Watch ""London Has Fallen"" - you will see what happens when any effort in writing department is being made to create a descent and involving action thriller. Poor flick.",London Has Fallen
40,tabuno,Bigger Isn't Always Better,6,12 January 2019,"15 September 2016. The Olympus Has Fallen (2013) sequel unfortunately becomes the bigger and louder isn't better route. This over the top action thriller actually takes its premise as a disaster movie at the beginning as if more explosions and more big deaths supposedly makes for a better movie. In short, in this case it definitely does not. The implausibility of the entire storyline crosses the line into impossible, unlikely fantasy much more than even the original. Unlike Harrison Ford's Clear and Present Danger (1994), Ben Affleck's Sum of All Fears (2002), over even Bruce Willis's Die Hard (1988), London Has Fallen is more about how much can the blown 'em up, shoot 'em mayhem can be achieved almost like a video game. This by the numbers one action scene after another become more and more a blur of how many ways can the director come up with more of the same but different. All of this makes for a rather boring, repetitive and unbelievable action thriller.",London Has Fallen
41,The-Sarkologist,Another Action Movie Involving terrorists,4,19 March 2016,"I'm not really sure about these types of movies. It seems that these days a lot of the action movies involve Middle Eastern terrorists launching some huge terrorist attack that in a way is completely unbelievable. Still, the main reason that I saw this film, and I have to admit that I knew that it was going to be an action movie involving Middle Eastern terrorists, was simply that I wanted to see a bit of action after having watched a rather intense Shakespeare play. Okay, the movie was enjoyable, and you do get your fair share of action, but a part of me feels that there is something missing these days compared to the good old action movies from the 80s.Anyway the Prime Minister of London has died and there is a state funeral that all of the world leaders have to attend. Of course the secret service is really concerned with security, but then again one would expect, especially in a place like London, that there is going to be a high level of security. As it turns out this was not the case for as soon as the president arrives at St Paul's Cathedral a gunfight breaks out, and a number of places around London are blown up resulting in the deaths of at least four heads of state. Not surprisingly the President of the United States manages to escape with his trusty secret service agent.While I didn't realise this at first, London has Fallen is actually the sequel to Olympus has Fallen. As such the completely unrealistic scenario that the White House is occupied by terrorists, and it turns out that the Washington DC police force has been infiltrated is translated across to London. Mind you, while we have had some instances of highly planned and executed terrorists attacks in the past (such as the ones in Paris) I still find the idea of the police force being infiltrated somewhat unrealistic. Also the planning, and execution, of this attack would have had to have taken years, and all it required was for one person to have been caught, and questioned, for the whole plan to fall apart. Okay, maybe this film is not supposed to be high in the realism department, but I have to admit that the only reason you would see such a film would be for the action.",London Has Fallen
42,Reno-Rangan,From an action packed flick to a game mode!,6,14 June 2016,"The first film was a decent entertainer, I kind of liked that and a box office hit as well. So the producers saw an opportunity to bring another film and yep, this film did slightly better than the original, but the product was qualityless. The graphics were just okay, but overall very poor in those blow-up scenes which were the most essential for a theme like this.Not all, though some of the action sequences were terrible and the story was very weak. In fact, there's no story, the whole film was an action- thriller just like the previous film. But that's how this theme revolves, yet as a one, it is a bit disappointing follow-up without surprises. Anyway, I'm with the original film director who backed out of the project for giving him a bad script to direct.So the London is the latest victim of the plot for the US president's assassination. Particularly this 2nd part looked so much more alike a computer game than actors who are exhibiting their roles. Like the London is a battlefield and level after level the story making its progress till the game over, but we know who wins in the end. I don't know whose performance was much better, because I did not find anyone with par to appreciate.What this film did at the box office was a miracle, so I don't think the filmmakers go for another script anytime soon. But if they do, I'm wondering which capitol would be the next victim of a terror attack. Expecting Tokyo or Canberra, especially Mumbai would be an ideal location. This is not a bad film, you can try it once, but watching it like sitting next to who's with xbox joystick.6/10",London Has Fallen
43,paulclaassen,Thrilling and entertaining.,6,13 October 2020,"More successful than its predecessor, I agree 'London Has Fallen' is better than 'Olympus Has Fallen'. This is a much shorter movie and therefore much faster paced.The original cast is back, and Gerard Butler is in top form. 'London Has Fallen' is a very thorough and polished film, with great attention to detail. The action sequences are stunning. This film is not as brutal, but still quite violent and relentless. Although more politically motivated, politics doesn't get in the way of this great adrenalin pumping action thriller. They don't bore us with unnecessary information. This is a pretty straight forward vengeance movie without being complex or delivering twists. It has one simple mission: get the bad guys, and its taking us along for the ride!'London Has Fallen' is entertaining and thrilling from beginning to end. And I loved the cinematography. Great ending, too.",London Has Fallen
44,sol-,Falling Down,4,14 August 2016,"In London for a funeral, the American President's life comes under threat during a city-wide terrorist attack and it is again up to the Secret Service agent from 'Olympus Has Fallen' to protect him in this sequel to the 2013 film. To its credit, 'London Has Fallen' does more than just recycle the original's premise and there are some eerie shots as Aaron Eckhart and Gerard Butler are forced to travel by foot through the dimly lit underground railway system. For all the time that they spend together though (far more than in the first installment), the film does precious little to establish rapport between the stars who always come second to explosions. That said, the film works better in action than drama mode. It is more than twenty minutes in before the action truly ignites and the talk-heavy early scenes are hard to endure with routine drama involving Butler feeling uncertain over becoming a father. This angle no doubt exists to provide character depth, but it actually serves to highlight how limited the depth here is. In the first film, Butler was a semi-disgraced serviceman trying to prove his worth; here, he begins and ends the same with little learnt along the way. Of course, if all that one wants is explosive action and the novelty of seeing several London landmarks destroyed, this film will suffice. The potential for more is striking though, especially with such a talented cast. And among such big names, it is odd that relative unknown Charlotte Riley shines the brightest, but as a disillusioned MI6 agent searching for a mole in her organisation, she has more to do than everyone else here.",London Has Fallen
