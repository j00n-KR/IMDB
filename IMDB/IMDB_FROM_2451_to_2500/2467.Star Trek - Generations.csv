0,MartinHafer,Fun to watch but a completely illogical and weak plot,5,15 July 2006,"This film is an excuse to pair Captain Picard with Captain Kirk--something that should not have normally occurred since Kirk died long before Picard was born according to the shows. However, because of a silly plot device called ""the nexus"", they join together to kick the butt of the bad guy, Malcolm McDowell. Because of this odd plot, you only get to see a few of the old crew and most of the new crew at the beginning of the film--the final half is just the showdown between the three. I really don't want to get into a thorough discussion of the plot and all that occurs--you can certainly see it yourself. But the film packs a lot of emotion into it--seeing one of the characters actually die twice in the film. And, it is odd but original. The problem, though, is that with this ""nexus"", you can choose to go back to any point in time and relive it--trying to correct what occurred the first time. However, when the captain gets that chance, why didn't he go back several months or even years and prevent anyone from dying in the first place? This plot hole is pretty big and makes what happened in the movie irrelevant if the good captain had only used his brain.",Star Trek - Generations
1,TheLittleSongbird,A new generation for 'Star Trek',6,20 July 2017,"'Star Trek: The Next Generation' may not be quite as influential or as ground-breaking as the original 'Star Trek' series, but quality-wise it is every bit as good with a few improvements.Like with the original series, 'Star Trek: The Next Generation' also spawned a series of films that are watchable in their own right but vary wildly in overall quality. 'Generations' is one of the weaker films based on 'The Next Generation' series, and to me one of the lesser 'Star Trek' films in general. There is plenty to admire here in 'Generations', but it is also frustrating that 'Generations' is as uneven as it is.It is very easy to see why 'Generations' has got its mixed critical reception and why it's generally met with disappointment by 'Star Trek' fans. It has been mentioned for very good reason that Kirk deserved a better send off than he got here. Even as someone who isn't a fan of William Shatner's acting and who prefers Spock vastly of the original crew characters, it cannot be denied regardless that the character is iconic in the 'Star Trek' universe. Instead of an affectionate and heartfelt send off it ought to have been, it felt like a rushed tacked on cheat that reeked of the studio and producers wanting to get rid of the characters. Shatner's ego has nothing to do with it (if so he wouldn't have stood for such an indifferent treatment of such a character), like it wasn't with the failure of 'The Final Frontier' which with the budget hindrances and studio interference was doomed from the start.More of a problem actually was Data's emotion chip subplot. Not only was it under-cooked in the writing and the explanations but it also felt well over-egged in how it featured in the film. It featured too much, and Data's ridiculously over the top behaviour (which Brent Spiner badly overdoes) and the humour that came with it embarrassingly contrived didn't help at all, instead further hindrances. It was lovely to see Chekov and Spotty again, they are played beautifully and have some humorous lines and interplay. They are underused however, seem out of character and their dialogue clashes with their personalities established in the original series, almost like there were other characters initially in mind.Some of the story execution could have been better. There are many good moments here, mostly down to characterisation, but some of the narrative is a bit muddled and with some of the padding and some leaden pacing it did seem to me, and others, like an extended episode of the series rather than an expansive own entity. While there are instances where the lighting is very striking and atmospheric, there are other instances of either being too dark or too garish.'Generations' has a lot to admire however. It is impeccably made, with rich and grand spectacle, elaborate settings, intimate and immersive photography and mostly first rate special effects (apart from the odd recycled one). The music score is very cleverly integrated into the film and works very well as music on its own. There is a mix of brassy pomp (like the fanfare in Kirk and Picard's first encounter), subtly intense mystery (the choral writing and synthesisers representing Picard's family discovery) and emotional lyricism (characterised by muted strings in Kirk's final scene). The sound effects are suitably eerie.The script is problematic, like its over-emphasis on the poorly thought out emotion chip subplot and some overly talky philosophising, but has its good parts too. A lot of what Picard says is very thought-provoking, the interplay between Kirk and Picard is both funny and poignant and some of the best lines come from Soran (like his chilling taunts and interaction with Picard).Likewise the story does have enough that's exciting, thought-provoking and compelling (even if it is bloated and unoriginal), and it's just about comprehensible (even with the Nexus stuff needing more clarity in places). It is very character heavy and is wisely driven by the characterisation and interaction. It's here where 'Generations' excels. Really enjoyed the interplay between Kirk and Picard, that reservations of them not gelling or the pairing not making sense were quickly forgotten. Picard's grief was also really quite moving, and Soran is a quite chilling threat which adds to the tension and suspense.With the exception of Spiner (which was the result of bad writing), the performances are very good. Shatner surprisingly and remarkably reigns in the temptation to ham in a rare occurrence, and the charismatic, more restrained and affectionate approach was appreciated while also not forgetting to have fun. Jonathan Frakes was also great, while the Next Generations crew and Walter Koenig and James Doohan entertain hugely as well. Patrick Stewart brings effortless dignified gravitas to Picard, while Malcolm McDowell is on snarlingly evil form as one of the most interesting and best acted cinematic 'Star Trek' villains.Overall, messy but with many things admiration-worthy. 6/10 Bethany Cox",Star Trek - Generations
2,bkoganbing,The Two Captains,7,13 August 2019,"A new Enterprise generation takes over from the old one in this Star Trek franchise movie. Remembering back when this first came out I recall that Paramount signed William Shatner and Patrick Stewart for a movie and then
wrote the script to contain both captains who roamed the galaxies a century
apart.This opens with William Shatner along with Walter Koenig and James Doohan out
of retirement to take a short spin on the inaugural voyage of a new Enterprise.
The ship gets called on a rescue mission but James T. Kirk is lost and presumed
dead.A century later Patrick Stewart and his Next Generation crew are involved with
chasing a renegade scientist Malcolm McDowell whom you can usually find
playing disturbed people. He's got some kind of mad scientist scheme to get
to a place called the Nexus where time and space have no meaning. To do that he has to launch a missile into a star and have it explode. That it will kill
all life in its solar system has little concern. As mad a scientist as you will
ever find.So there's Jean-Luc Picard in pursuit and he gets help from an unlikely source.That's as far as I go. McDowell is a great villain, always is. It's not the greatest
of science fiction plots I've seen. But Trekkies around the globe will love this
summit film from the Star Trek franchise.",Star Trek - Generations
3,Leofwine_draca,Stodgy end for the original crew,5,14 October 2014,"STAR TREK: GENERATIONS was widely heralded as the cross-over movie that featured crews from both the original 1960s STAR TREK along with the cast of STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION. Unfortunately it's pretty much a failure on both counts, coming across as a particularly stodgy extended TV episode.The problem with the original cast is that there are only three of them, and the biggies (Nimoy, Kelly) are missing. Meanwhile, Doohan and Koenig only get a few scenes in the beginning. Shatner does better, but even he's kept off-screen for a great deal of time, leaving this a shambles. Personally I was left waiting for his return as the film inevitably picks up whenever he's around.The stuff with the new crew is largely embarrassing, particularly a never-ending sub-plot involving Data getting an emotion chip which leads to some of the lamest, most embarrassing comedy ever. It just has no place in a film like this, and it feels like the writer was just attempting to fill up the running time. Patrick Stewart is equally wasted, moping about with his non-existent family. At least Malcolm McDowell gives a decent turn as the villain, and the film's pretty entertaining when it focuses on him and Kirk; so the first half hour and the last half hour are the decent bits, and the rest is rather dull, silly, and stodgy.",Star Trek - Generations
4,SnoopyStyle,the hand-off,7,24 April 2016,"Retired Captain Kirk, Scottie, and Chekov are attending the maiden voyage of the new Enterprise with the media. They are surprised by a distress call. Kirk manages to save some of the refugees before losing himself to the energy ribbon. Two of the survivors are Tolian Soran (Malcolm McDowell) and Guinan (Whoopi Goldberg). Almost eighty years later, The Next Generation crew encounters Soran who is working with the Klingon Duras sisters for his own purpose of returning to the energy ribbon and Nexus.This movie achieves the needed goals of the franchise. It gives Kirk a final curtain call, and it gives a satisfying hand-off between the old crew and the new one. Kirk is one of the iconic characters of not only Star Trek but all of sci-fi. This movie basically gives him two death scenes and they are both classic Kirk. The hand-off is needed for the Next Generation to take over the movie franchise. Granted, it works best for fans who have seen both series. For non-fans, the characters would still make sense but it wouldn't be quite so satisfying. The movie itself has enough technical babble and sci-fi action for those familiar with the franchise. It is a bigger expansion of the new TV series but it's not different.",Star Trek - Generations
5,Hitchcoc,Get a Life/It's a Movie,7,6 January 2017,"I agree that this is far from the best of the Star Trek movies, but it has an interesting premise, the acting is good, and it gives us a cinematic transition from one era to another. Once Einstein gave us the business of time warping and being able to slip into alternate universes and revisit previous places, even paralleling the the current characters, it left everything wide open. I don't know what the big deal is with Jean Luc Picard crying. He's not a robot. Kirk was really a pretty one dimensional character with very little emotional baggage. That's great. Not everyone is Kirk nor should they be. Ultimately, we have a group of very creative people putting together a threat to the universe, a puzzle that must be solved. Through that aforementioned fabric, two heroes emerge and solve things. I have to get a little political here. I am so tired of people who are so wrapped up in these things that they actually get hostile. It's a review of a movie. Get out of the house more.",Star Trek - Generations
6,jboothmillard,Star Trek: Generations,7,14 August 2010,"With the original cast moving on to other things, and in some cases sadly passing away, this was the first of four films (who knows if they'll be more) to introduce the cast of The Next Generation, and it's not a bad one. The film opens with original and retired Captain James T. Kirk (William Shatner), with old favourites Capt. Montgomery ""Scotty"" Scott (James Doohan) and Commander Pavel Chekov (Walter Koenig), overlooking the new Enterprise before it is handed over, and disaster leads the Captain to his death. Seventy-eight years later, we see the new Captain, Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) and his crew given a mission to help out members of an attacked satellite, including Dr. Tolian Soran (A Clockwork Orange's Malcolm McDowell). Soon enough Dr. Soran shows his true colours when he starts putting his plan into action, with the help of some Klingons, other survivor Guinan (Whoopi Goldberg) knows that the renegade scientist wants to use his technology to return to what is know as the Nexus. To do this he needs to destroy a star system, so he has prepared a missile to do just that, and his plan is successful, and he takes Picard with him. In the Nexus, time is not a limit, whatever you have wanted and any memories that are your most treasured will be what you experience, in Picard's case, it's having a family with a wife and four children at Christmas time. He knows though that it is not real, and with the help of another man living in the Nexus, Captain Kirk, they make their way out to the moment before the missile is fired. In the end, the villain is defeated, the world returns to normal, and sadly Kirk dies once again in the battle, but Picard buries the great man. Also in the story, we see android Lt. Commander Data (Independence Day's Brent Spiner) experimenting with learning human emotions by placing a new advanced silicon chip in his head. Also starring Jonathan Frakes as Commander William T. Riker, LeVar Burton as Lt. Commander Geordi La Forge, Michael Dorn as Lt. Commander Worf, Gates McFadden as Doctor Beverly Crusher and Marina Sirtis as Counselor Deanna Troi. Stewart proves to be just as admirable as Shatner was, Spiner is both funny and moving with his newfound emotions, and I will say that McDowell could be a bit nastier, but he does okay, with some good moments of actions, special effects, and a clever idea bringing the two Captains together, a good science-fiction adventure. Very good!",Star Trek - Generations
7,Tweekums,Farewell to Kirk as the Next Generation hit the big screen,7,17 October 2016,"This, the seventh 'Star Trek' film, opens with Kirk, Scotty and Chekov visiting the Enterprise B to help celebrate its launch. While they are aboard a distress call is received from two ships that are being destroyed by an 'energy ribbon'; many people are saved; including a man named Soran and a familiar woman Guinan. Unfortunately there was a price to be paid; Captain Kirk was lost presumed dead when a bulkhead ruptures.Seventy eight years later a new crew on a new Enterprise also receive a distress signal, this time from a space station; once again one of the survivors is Soran. It turns out he is the same long-lived species as Guinan and he will do anything to get back to the energy Ribbon. Guinan explains to Captain Picard that it is something known as the Nexus and inside it time has no meaning and life is permanently joyful. Before his plans can be exposed Soran captures Geordi and beams aboard a Klingon ship operated by the Duras Sisters. The events that follow see the destruction of the Enterprise and Picard entering the Nexus where he meets a familiar person he also learns that he can leave at any time he likes so may have a second chance to stop Soran; even if the cost will be high. If all this wasn't enough Data is having to come to terms with having emotions after installing an emotion chip.After the conclusion of 'Star Trek: The Next Generation' series it was of no surprise that its crew would return on the big screen. The way the baton was metaphorically handed from Kirk to Picard was effective although the cinematic introduction to the new crew was a bit surprising; we first see them on the holodeck where they are aboard an old sailing ship. The scene wasn't without humour though; Data pushing Dr Crusher overboard was hilarious even if those around him weren't amused. The cast does a fine job; most notable Brent Spiner who gets to do something different as Data comes to terms with emotions. Malcom McDowell is impressive as Soran although I'm sure nobody will be surprised when it emerges that he is the bad guy. As one would expect there is a good amount of action including the destruction of the Enterprise D; the ship that survived seven seasons of 'The Next Generation'. Overall this was fun despite being messy at times as events are contrived to bring the two famous captains together.",Star Trek - Generations

9,Quinoa1984,"The crossover is less than great, even less than good most of the time.",6,1 October 2004,"Star Trek is one of those franchises, like with the motion picture releases from Saturday Night Live, that isn't very consistent and relies on certain groups of fans for their pull. Whether or not you prefer the old Star Trek to The Next Generation or perhaps vice-versa may have an impact on accepting the 'transitional' film in the series. Although there is something about the original crew of the Enterprise, and the filmmakers that were behind their six films, that often inspired some awe for the genre, I'm not entirely out of the Next Generation loop. The only problem is, in the case of Star Trek: Generations, the content doesn't really fit the aspirations.For those non-Trekkies that don't know how the torch got passed, here's the sum-up: Kirk and a few of the old regulars are in the film for the better part of the first and third acts, and are otherwise over-shadowed by the Enterprise-D. Picard (Patrick Stewart, given a couple of effective scenes amid the plot schematics) and the crew are up against Soren (Malcolm McDowell), who wants to destroy stars in order to gain energy for 'the nexus'. In order to fight this mad scientist, Picard has to resurrect someone who's been dead for seventy-eight years. You guessed it, it's Kirk, at first reluctant to be enlisted for help. Along with this, a sub-plot follows Data (Brent Spiner) with an 'emotion chip' in his brain.On the technical side of things, it can be said that David Carson (mostly credited for TV shows and movies) and his crew do a competent job. The special effects are pretty standard if you've seen the Next Generation TV show, with one neat little feature being the Stellar Cartography bit. As well, the cinematographer John A. Alonzo brings some interesting hand-held moments and framing. The other better than expected element is McDowell as Soren, who is given some screen time to develop his character past the kind he might play on the TV show(s). But besides that, unless you're a die-hard Trek fan the film doesn't deliver up to even minimal expectations.Shatner, a pro at just looking the part of James T. Kirk, doesn't have the kinds of lines a fan or just admirer might want in his last outing. The Data sub-plot is under-cooked and poorly acted (maybe some will laugh). And while the on-set locations are filmed with an eye for detail, there isn't a whole lot of interest put into the story. Perhaps this is more to put on the blame of the screenwriters. In the end, 'Generations' is suitable to view if very interested in learning the chronology of the films. Overall, it's lackluster in the ways that count for a film as opposed to TV, as though it's just a TV-movie with guest stars such as McDowell and Whoppi Goldberg. C",Star Trek - Generations
10,hitchcockthelegend,Pass the Phaser...gently if you will.,5,14 April 2013,"I have never quite bought into the ""curse of the odd numbers"" theory as regards the Star Trek movies, mainly because it's not as if all the odd numbered movies are stinkers, there is good value for Trek fans to be had. However, part seven, Generations, is a massive opportunity wasted. What should have been a smooth transference of the old Star Trek Enterprise to the new funky mob, something to please the old whilst embracing the new, is sadly neither here nor there.Plot basically features a planet crunching Nexus? And a barmy scientist in the form of Malcolm McDowell who we assume is up to no good when it reappears in the future. Enter Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart), the latest in the hot seat of the Enterprise, who has to team up with the famous Captain James T. Kirk, long since dead apparently, to save civilisations. That's pretty much it as a soggy wet screenplay hangs the plot out there to dry whilst director David Carson throws action set-pieces in the mix every other 15 minutes.Neither fans of either generation of the Enterprise are well served, unless the sub-plot of Data's (Bret Spiner) emotional chip shenanigans lights your fires? There is a distinct lack of genuine end of the universe peril, or credible villainy for that matter, while the attempt to make Kirk (William Shatner aged 63 at time of filming) out as an old age pensioner action hero?! Would be laughable were it no so sad and detrimental to the status the character has earned over the decades. Yes, the special effects are amazing, really eye popping, and the sound mix is also ear splinteringly joyous, but this is poor fodder and comes second only to The Final Frontier on the list of worst Star Trek films. 5/10",Star Trek - Generations
11,Hey_Sweden,"""I was out saving the galaxy while your grandfather was still in diapers.""",7,30 June 2020,"The crew of the Starship Enterprise have a major dilemma on their hands when a scientist named Soran (Malcolm McDowell), whom they'd once saved from his doomed home planet, reveals himself to be a very bad guy. He's hellbent on returning to something called the Nexus, a domain where, once a person has been there, they apparently don't want to leave. It's just pure joy. To stop Soran, Captain Picard (the great Sir Patrick Stewart) must team with the legendary Captain Kirk (the almighty William Shatner), who supposedly perished saving the ""Enterprise-B"" during its maiden voyage.""Generations"" initially comes off as a great gimmick, of uniting two generations of Enterprise crews, but this never really pays off, as the only two who meet are Picard and Kirk. ""Generations"" is NOT one of the stronger entries in this film series, with an engaging but uninspired story. The main attraction for veteran fans is likely to be the prospect of Picard and Kirk teaming up for the final half hour, engaging in fisticuffs with the maniacal Soran and hurrying to prevent him from destroying a star.This viewer can't speak as one who has necessarily been a big Trek fan from the start, so he basically views this as pretty fun, all things considered. Certainly all the series regulars are in very fine form, with the android Data (Brent Spiner) getting the lions' share of the comedy relief, as he has inserted a special computer chip that allows him to experience emotions. This presents a problem at times, because either *everything* is amusing to him, or he gets scared easily.It's nice to see old hands James Doohan and Walter Koenig, however briefly; Shatner brings the final part of the film to life. Not such an easy task, given the talents of Stewart (Picard has some key emotional moments) and the delicious, hammy villainy of McDowell. In addition to the regulars from the 'Next Generation' series, other familiar faces like Alan Ruck, Jacqueline Kim, Jenette Goldstein, Glenn Morshower, Tim Russ, and Brian Thompson turn up. An unbilled Whoopi Goldberg reprises her role of Guinan.Wonderful music by Dennis McCarthy and some impressive visual effects by ILM help to make this a reasonably entertaining series entry.Seven out of 10.",Star Trek - Generations

Most glaring is the fact that the much maligned William Shatner is left to his own devices in this film, he's the only one to bridge to the ""future"" seems wildly out of place.

15,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Or, rather, 20% 1st generation, 80% 2nd",7,30 October 2010,"The Enterprise is leaving orbit again. As an indication of the level of cheese in this, the first thing we see once out the opening credits sequence is a bottle being smashed against the vessel(...yes, in outer space), like they used to do with ships before their maiden voyage. Wow. Well, I guess that's what we should expect from the franchise, at least back then. Anyway, things seem to be going well. Kirk and two non-specific(OK, it's Scotty and Chekov... but it could have been anyone still alive from TOS) crew members are there, retired and not in an official capacity. Jim comments that it's good this has a Sulu(it's the daughter) at the helm(as long as he or she ain't the captain, eh, Shat?). On a rescue mission, they run into a big problem(I think it might be because they brought Goldstein along... seriously, her being in sci-fi means that someone near her is going to get it pretty bad)... oh, there's something about a nexus that destroys ships, but the more pressing issue is that the technology in Roddenberry's(R.I.P.) vision is so perfect that they have to think of reasons for why it can't get them out of the situation. In the first fifteen minutes, we get no less than three jokes about the convenience for the script of them having left Earth without several vital things. I guess no one(including the writers) learned from the 1979 film... when the danger comes from what our cast is flying in, it makes Starfleet seem incompetent. Anyway, Picard and Data(oh, and I *think* the rest of the folks from TNG are there, in the background, with no development of, or focus on, any of them) are sent, 80 years later, to deal with, well, the same thing, only reappearing. Don't expect this to tell you who anyone is or what they're like(then again, the show *had* been running for seven years when this came out... which makes is strange that this goes against the canon, and I also don't know why they felt the need to have Stewart miss his family, and Spiner strive to be human... while these themes are central to them, they're explored far better in the series; I know it is difficult in a feature film to give all the characters equal screen-time, still, that was what Next Gen was all about, and this feels pretty ""been there, done that""). We get Brent having emotions, and it's creepy and annoying. I guess it's meant to be. The acting is great, everyone puts in a good performance. McDowell is enjoyable to watch as a madman(basically, he's certain that time will eventually make us all its bitch, and it bothers him... so he wants to never die). The philosophy is fine, if the execution leaves the audience a tad cold. This has pretty solid FX, and it is genuinely exciting, and at its best, engaging. If you're a stickler for realism and science that holds up, keep your magnifying glass a safe distance away from the plot. There is a little moderate language and mild violence in this. I recommend this to big fans of ST. 7/10",Star Trek - Generations

The Enterprise manages to save a handful of he ships' passengers and barely makes it out intact...but at the cost of Captain Kirk's life. Seventy-eight years later, Captain Jean-Luc Picard and the crew of the Enterprise-D find themselves at odds with the renegade scientist Soren...who is destroying entire star systems. Only one man can help Picard stop Soren's scheme...and he's been dead for seventy-eight years...I'm not a Star Trek fan, but i can imagine that the thought of Shatner and Stewart starring alongside each other in this movie is the equivalent of seeing Pacino and De Niro in Heat. It's a fun movie, but not because of the two captains, it's fun because of the great scenery and Macdowell as the pantomime villain.He chews all the scenery when he is present, and makes a worthwhile villain. There are sub- plots involving other characters that go straight over my head, but i feel that this is because i have not seen the series, nor have watched the films in chronological order.The cast are fine and look like that they are having fun making this, and the set pieces are adequate for any stand alone Sci-Fi movie.worth watching.",Star Trek - Generations
18,Aaron1375,It is an odd numbered movie in the series so I was destined not to like it.,3,25 September 2009,"In the Star Trek universe I usually have enjoyed the even numbered movies, not so much the odd and this one is no exception. It probably did not help that it had the next generation cast which I never really liked all that much anyway. Granted I enjoy seeing Patrick Stewart in other roles as he is a very enjoyable actor to watch, I just do not like him all that much as Picard. This movie also for some reason really feels compelled to kill Captain Kirk not once, but twice even. Like it feels he is a vampire and must be destroyed for this new captain to fully take hold. The plot device to get everyone together is utterly insane, basically an energy ribbon in space that destroys things also for some reason can teleport people to this wonderful land where dreams become reality, and one will do anything to get back. Which makes it seem rather strange the way both Picard and Kirk have no trouble escaping this place that one man would kill millions to get back to. The only redeeming factor in the movie is McDowell as the villain a role he can probably do asleep and a few nice special effects shots. Surprisingly, the next movie I would enjoy and surprise it is an even numbered entry into the franchise.",Star Trek - Generations
19,Wuchakk,Ambitious and High-Concept Sci-Fi (for Grown-Ups only),9,4 January 2012,"I can see WHY some don't like ""Generations"" (1994) or don't 'get' it: This seventh Star Trek film has some (false) plot holes and some things aren't spelled-out or explained very well (So what? Doesn't mystery intrinsically come with the territory of space adventure?); plus the story is a bit convoluted, particularly for those not familiar with Star Trek up to this point, both generations.Regardless, ""Generations"" is ambitious, high-concept sci-fi of the highest order; it leaves the viewer with many interesting questions to ponder long afterwards. Although the Nexus has been criticized as a mere gimmick to get Kirk and Picard together, I find the concept utterly fascinating: No matter how much we want it, an illusory paradise is just that, an illusion. As far as I'm concerned, the concept of the Nexus and its implementation into the storyline is nothing short of brilliant. Who created the Nexus? Why, who else but the Talosians, the 'antagonists' of Trek's very first episode, ""The Cage""! Think about it.Besides this, there are multiple highlights (some SPOILERS follow): The usual Trek humor, Data's amusing experiences with the emotion chip, Malcolm McDowell's outstanding performance as the Soran, his believable obsession and justifications, B'Etor & Lursa and their ""wild bunch"" Klingons, the startling obliteration of them and their vessel, the thrilling crash-landing of the Enterprise-D, the meeting of Kirk and Picard in the Nexus, the final showdown with Soran and Kirk's death. Needless to say, ""Generations"" does far more than offer mere juvenile space battles.BIGGEST PLOT HOLE (OR MAYBE NOT): Picard's purpose in leaving the Nexus is to stop Soran from annihilating the Enerprise-D crew and the entire Veridian solar system, including the 230 million people that live on Veridian IV. Since Picard can leave the Nexus and ""go anywhere any time,"" as Guinan pointed out earlier, why go to Veridian III about A MINUTE before Soran launches his rocket? Why not go back to when Soran was a guest on the Enterprise-D and apprehend him then and there? Writer Ronald D. Moore defended Picard's decision on the grounds that he didn't want to risk the dangerous and unexpected consequences that can occur when tampering with the timeline; hence, his journey back in time from the Nexus is only a matter of a minute or so. It's a good explanation.Speaking of explanations, some have criticized the fact that Guinan is simultaneously present in the real world and in the Nexus. How could this be? It's simple: It is repeatedly established that the reality experienced in the Nexus is not real; one experiences what they desire in the Nexus, not what is necessarily real. For instance, Picard has no children in the real world, but because he DESIRED to have them he was able to experience them in the Nexus. Hence, the 'Guinan' portrayed in the Nexus may walk, talk and act precisely like Guinan, but she's not real. She's only there because Picard desires her to be there for the purpose of explaining the nature of the Nexus. That said, many of the people in the Nexus are real, like Picard and Kirk.COMMENTARY ON THE NEXUS: Although the Nexus should simply be taken at face value as a strange space phenomenon (likely created by the Talosians), you can also regard it as an analogy. At first glance the viewer might get the impression that the Nexus is a type of heaven, but this can't be so since it is repeatedly emphasized in the film that the people and events experienced in the Nexus are NOT real (for the most part). 'Heaven,' a term theologians and ministers traditionally use to refer to the eternal abode of the redeemed (technically referred to as ""the new heavens and new earth"" in the bible, as shown in 2 Peter 3:13), is always depicted as real in the bible, not an illusory paradise. If the Nexus is not analogous of heaven, what could it be a type of? The Nexus corresponds to any addiction a person ""tastes"" and embraces to escape reality (e.g. pipe dreams, drugs, alcohol, computer games, TV, porn, fishing, shopping, golf, etc.). Some, like Soran, are unable to flee its clutches and waste their lives and talents OBSESSED by it. Others, like Picard and Kirk, are able to see the truth and escape; they therefore ""make a difference"" in real life.BOTTOM LINE: This ""passing-of-the-torch"" installment requires an attention span and an appreciation for high-concept sci-fi; it will likely bore those for whom Star Trek only means neato spacecrafts and superficial space dogfights (don't get me wrong, they each have their place in Trek). ""Generations"" has the courage to make bold changes -- killing off an iconic character, and fairly prominent support characters as well, not to mention destroying the Enterprise-D. In short, ""Generations"" is science-fiction for grown-ups and youth with advanced cerebral development. All others should stick with juvenile space fantasy flicks (giggle).The film runs 1 hour, 57 minutes.GRADE: A",Star Trek - Generations
20,trashgang,strong first 60 minutes but then it fails,6,26 October 2016,"Great start with some of the old crew visiting the Enterprise to go on some kind of one day trip until things go wrong and Kirk has to save the ship but sadly he dies. From there on we do meet the new crew and there are more aliens on board. No Vulcans anymore. But does it work out as it should. The effects used are great for the time being and do still stand time. The new crew I do have issues with them. Data isn't my cup of tea, annoying figure with stupid jokes. But just leave it toward the flick itself.I didn't like the story at all. Especially the last 30 minutes when the new Captain Picard goes back in time and do meet Captain Kirk. Both go into action to catch Soran, well played by Malcolm McDowell. To much of blah blah and the scene when Picard is at home with his family I really had the stop button on my fingertips. As long as the Klingons were in the flick it's okay but once the Bird Of Prey is destroyed it also destroys this flick.

21,Mr-Fusion,Lackluster passing of the torch,5,4 December 2013,"There are two things that ""Star Trek: Generations"" really has going for it: One, this really feels like a Next Generation movie in a lot of respects. The infamous technobabble is present and accounted for, and so is the ensemble cast.Two, the lighting here really shows off the graduation to the big screen. In certain areas, it's either washed-out or too dark (Ten Forward and Picard's ready room, respectively), but man, that bridge looks damn good.And it really should've been a strictly TNG movie. There's no need for any crewmembers from the original series, and they just feel shoe-horned into the plot to ""help"" the new Enterprise get off to a good start. And don't get me started on the awful sendoff for a major character; but the real point here is that he/she shouldn't have been here in the first place. I think this story could've worked well on its own without their involvement. The Nexus is a good sci-fi hook, and McDowell is a terrific bad guy. But as it stands, the movie can't ever get a really good flow going without something clumsy added in to mess things up.Also, if you're going to destroy the Enterprise, have a good reason for doing so. It's a great effects piece for the movie, but that ship was something special.At least Kirk had a good reason for killing his.5/10",Star Trek - Generations

24,sddavis63,Perhaps The Best Of The Star Trek Movies,8,11 January 2003,"In my opinion, ""Generations"" is the best of the Star Trek movie series for a number of reasons. Although ""The Undiscovered Country"" represented a fitting ending for the original crew, this movie was a good way of blending original Trek with Next Generation Trek. Given almost 80 years difference in the generations, I though the solution for doing this was quite ingenious. 78 years apart, both Kirk (William Shatner) and Picard (Patrick Stewart) find themselves sucked into the ""Nexus"" - a huge energy ""ribbon"" in which time has no meaning - where they meet each other and join forces to defeat this instalment's villain - Dr. Soren (Malcolm McDowell, in what I thought was an excellent performance; he's one of the better villains to appear in the Star Trek movies.)James Doohan (Scotty) and Walter Koenig (Chekhov) both make appearances at the beginning of the movie (which opens in the era of the original cast) and - given the premise in which they appear (kind of an honorary visit to the Enterprise ""B"" as it prepares to launch for the first time) - their ages really don't matter that much. This was always a bit of a problem for me with the movies starring the original cast. They always seemed to be getting just too old to keep being sent on these emergency missions. Here, their presence on the Enterprise ""B"" makes sense. I thought that Alan Ruck (playing Captain Harriman of the Enterprise ""B"") did quite a good job of playing a nervous young captain, a bit overwhelmed at the presence of the heroic and famous Kirk on his bridge. The Next Generation cast, having only recently ended the TV series, slipped into their roles without effort. Brent Spiner I thought was extremely good playing Data, who has recently added an ""emotion chip"" to his positronic brain, and is having to adjust to his new feelings while trying to do his duty.The movie revolved, though, around Stewart and Shatner. Interestingly enough, I thought this may have been Shatner's best outing as Kirk in the movies, perhaps because although he was still playing Kirk as the hero, he wasn't burdened with being the only star. Stewart was clearly playing that role (and Kirk was appropriately deferential to Picard - as he was to Harriman for that matter.) Shatner and Stewart seemed to work well together, giving Kirk and Picard a real chemistry. Flaws? Well, a few minor things. It bugged me that the transporter technician (speaking only on radio) referred to ""Commander LaForge and Mr. Data."" Why not ""Commander Data?"" After all, Data outranks LaForge. Why honour LaForge with his rank, but not Data? No respect for android officers? That's a minor point, of course. I also thought that the connection between the two generations might have been even stronger if Leonard Nimoy had somehow been written into the story as Spock. Spock spanned both series, and a reunion of Kirk and Spock 80 years later might have been quite touching. But overall, minor weaknesses aside, this was an excellent movie with a good story and flow and interesting all the way through.8/10",Star Trek - Generations
25,thesar-2,Little Life-Forms Beware!,3,11 April 2009,"Just as William Shatner almost killed the series as director of 'Star Trek V,' Picard and Data practically accomplished the same feat. My analysis is they unsuccessfully tried two different new plot lines into 'Star Trek: Generations': Picard's emotions and Data's over-emotions. First Picard cries, heavily, followed by Data integrating an emotion chip into his brain. As the Next Generation's first big screen voyage, I think this was too much, too heavy. They should've just introduced the new Enterprise crew, verses expanding on the already fully run series. Who really wants to see Picard cry? Or who wants to see Data joke about ""Little life-forms""? (By the way, that was NOT funny. It was annoying. As was his ""Go to hell"" line that was stolen from 'Star Trek VI.') Sure Malcolm McDowell was great, as usual, and it was wonderful to see Whoopi Goldberg, as well as Tim Russ (from 'Star Trek: Voyager,') but the rest of the crew just sat around and expected you to know who they were from the TV show. The movie wasn't a complete waste: the opening with three of the original crew helping ""Cameron"" (from 'Ferris Bueller's Day Off') helm Enterprise B, McDowell's performance (other than his finale on the desert planet,) the ""Nexus"" scene that joined Kirk and Picard were great and (no spoiler) Kirk's demise in a desert scene, much like a lot of the original TV show's backdrops. Unfortunately, my favorite Next-Gen character, Data, spends most of the film like a fool, attempting to correct his new emotion chip. This ruined his character and practically the film. Basically, we have a story based around a smart, century-old man who is desperate to get back to the womb of ecstasy. After watching the first 6 adventures, this next-gen one is kind of a letdown: gone is the humor, mystery and cowboy-antics that made the original crew lovable.",Star Trek - Generations
26,bensonmum2,"""Actually, Captain, I am familiar with history. And if I'm not mistaken, you're dead.""",4,9 February 2008,"I remember seeing Star Trek: Generations in the theater back in 1994. At the time, I was so heavily into Star Trek: The Next Generation that anything with Picard and Data was going appeal to me. Seeing it now, some 13 years later, the best word I can think of to describe the experience is ""silly"". Oh, I enjoyed bits and pieces of the movie, but overall, Star Trek: Generations has to be one of the silliest movies I can remember seeing recently. From an overweight and much too old William Shatner attempting to play an action hero to the incredibly annoying subplot involving Data and an emotion chip, it's all so silly. How in the world did I ever think this tripe was good? The plot involves a scientist named Soran (Malcolm McDowell) and his attempt to enter a mysterious energy ribbon called the Nexus. His plan, though, would require the destruction of the Enterprise and an entire planet. Captains Picard and Kirk must put a stop to the madman's plans.The best thing Star Trek: Generations has going for it is McDowell. The man proves once again that regardless of the poorly written script and ridiculous plot, he's capable of giving a solid performance. In comparison, I'm really not shocked to see that most of the rest of the Star Trek cast has done very little of note since this movie.",Star Trek - Generations
27,bowmanblue,Trek for everyone?,7,11 March 2015,"Star Trek (VII) 'Generations' had the difficult job of trying to please everyone (or every 'Trekkie' at least) by bringing together both Captains of the Enterprise in the same adventure, while, at the same time, not giving too much screen time to the more tried and tested filmic icon, James T Kirk, in favour of the Next Generation.So, out went the bankable old crew and in came the untested marketing enigma of whether the Next Generation's success on the small screen would translate to the big screen. And it was made so. Just.Star Trek lore tells that the even numbered films are better than the odds. And, when you compare to the previous 'Undiscovered Country' (number 6) and the following 'First Contact' (8), you may be inclined to agree.Generations is not a bad film. It's definitely one of the better odd numbered Star Trek films, but it was hampered with the impossible mission of bridging the gap between old and new. It does its best. The small time the two Captains are together is good fun to watch, just woefully too short. But then again, it's supposed to be the new lot's film, not another James T Kirk affair. Also, back with Kirk, there were only really three main characters (Kirk, Spock and Bones). Since the Next Generation, every regular cast member has been given his or her own set of episodes, therefore all of them are - almost - given their own screen time. Unfortunately, most people only prefer the more interesting characters of Piccard and Data, meaning you have to put up with Beverly Crusher and Ryker at the same time.Generations won't really win too many new fans over to the Trek Universe. It's more a labour of love. I don't know anyone who truly loves it. They sort of put up with it as a necessary bridging gap between old and new. It's not the best, but it certainly isn't the worse (films 5 and 9 get my vote on that one).You probably need slightly more than a mild interest in Trek to really enjoy this.",Star Trek - Generations
28,ThomasDrufke,Time is a Companion,6,13 July 2016,"Sometimes a franchise and its characters have run its course to a point where new faces and fresh ideas are needed. Though the Star Trek franchise as a whole was at a high in 1994 with two acclaimed TV series airing and the films coming off a great finale in 'The Undiscovered Country', to me, 'Generations' wasn't the proper next step to take.Sure, it's hard to let go of beloved characters, but 'The Undiscovered Country' felt like the perfect send off for all of the original cast members, including Captain Kirk. Nonetheless he was brought back to past the torch to the next crew to man the Enterprise. Of course, that group being the cast from The Next Generation. Which is exactly where the film has most of its problems.Attempting to balance both timelines, Kirks being 75 years or so earlier, and Captain Picard's (Patrick Stewart) being present day, sometimes the film feels jumbled and bunched together. In other words, there's plenty of set up with the main antagonist played by Malcom McDowell, but the pay-off takes a great deal of time and exposition to get to. It's a much different universe, but Star Wars did an impeccable job blending both casts into The Force Awakens, so that's more along the lines of what I was hoping for.With all that being said, the new cast from the TV series definitely deserve their own individual film (which is obviously what they got a few years later). It's impossible to top the original crew, but there's enough personalities and likable characters, including Stewart's stern but sympathetic Picard.As far as the actual plot itself goes, it pretty much follows the same Star Trek formula, except for the trippy Nexus sequence where Picard and Kirk are stuck in a time loop. It's the most talked about and controversial scenes from the film, and for good reason. I don't necessarily think the sequence works the way it supposed to, but it is where we end up getting the most emotional pay off.

30,CuriosityKilledShawn,A Disenchanted Generation,6,9 January 2016,"I remember seeing Star Trek VI in cinemas near Xmas-time in 1991 and being satisfied that the original crew signed-off on such a strong film before handing over the Enterprise to new generations. I ate up a lot TNG on television when I was a sick teenager with nothing else to do but lie in bed. A lot of people were disappointed with Generations when it was released in late '94/early '95 but I didn't get to see it until much later. Now, as an adult with a refined opinion, I can see how dissatisfying it is.With Kirk and Co. moving on the Enterprise is now helmed by the naïve Harriman, who lacks the confidence to trust his own decisions. When a mysterious energy ribbon causes havoc on the other side of the galaxy the Enterprise rushes in to save the day, but guest of honor Kirk dies (or apparently dies) when a huge section of the deck is torn off the ship, taking him with it.Flash-forward 78 years and Picard is now at the helm of Enterprise-D and the ribbon, now called the Nexus, has come back. After beaming the survivors of a doomed solar observatory on-board Guinan recognizes one of them as Doctor Soran, who survived the previous Nexus disaster. Picard's suspicion of Soran is proved correct when he double-crosses the Federation, kidnaps Geordie, and hooks up with the Klingons. Meanwhile Data experiments with his emotions chip and feels guilt over not being able to save Geordie.The plot makes Z-E-R-O sense when you think about it. The Nexus is apparently a type of heaven where your dreams can come true on a whim. A nice idea, but Soran's motivation is to get back into the Nexus as any cost. He plans on destroying a solar system to pull the Nexus close to him and be whisked away. Er...why does he not just fly into it in a ship? If Kirk is in the Nexus and is still alive then it will obviously work even if the ship gets destroyed. If this DIDN'T work for whatever reason then just beam into the Nexus. Duh!For some reason Paramount didn't think a movie about the hugely successful Next Generation crew would stand on its own so they cooked-up this nonsense plot to shoehorn a Kirk/Picard team-up into the mix. But they barely feature together and Kirk's real death scene is the STUPIDEST death in movie history. What were they thinking? He falls a few feet from a rickety platform? Really??? THAT is the big send off for one of the most iconic characters in all of history?Aside from this massive failing the film looks great with lots of dark lighting and shadows, and is a huge step-up from TV production values. Sadly, Jerry Goldsmith did not score this one, leaving the composing duties to TV composer Dennis McCarthy who does an adequate job, but the movie is painfully lacking the familiar Star Trek themes. The action and effects are still quite nice to this day, which is unusual for 1994 vintage CG.Star Trek Generations is simply incapable of giving the audience what it wants. The arrogance of the studio and producers faulted this film down to the marrow, but there is still a lot in there which is entertaining, especially the ethereal atmosphere inside the Nexus.

William Shatner was brave to take this role,7,10 February 2011,"(Credit IMDb) In the late twenty-third century, the gala maiden voyage of the third Starship Enterprise (NCC-1701-B) boasts such luminaries as Pavel Chekov, Montgomery Scott, and the legendary Captain James T. Kirk as guests. But the maiden voyage turns to disaster as the unprepared ship is forced to rescue two transport ships from a mysterious energy ribbon. The Enterprise manages to save a handful of he ships' passengers and barely makes it out intact...but at the cost of Captain Kirk's life. Seventy-eight years later, Captain Jean-Luc Picard and the crew of the Enterprise-D find themselves at odds with the renegade scientist Soren...who is destroying entire star systems. Only one man can help Picard stop Soren's scheme...and he's been dead for seventy-eight years...I find this to be very underrated among Star Trek goers. I mean, how cool is it to see the two greatest Star Trek characters in history Shatner's Kirk and Stewart's Picard team up to face evil adversity. It was a real treat to watch. I'm well aware Patrick Stewart had already started Trek previously before this with the TV series, Star Trek: The Next Generation, but it was still cool. I also thought the opening tribute to Kirk was well-done, and neat to see, considering he did so much for keeping Star Trek alive. This movie also benefits from one of the most underrated madman's of cinema Malcolm McDowell playing crazy like only he can, going up against the two memorable Star Trek icons. The finale is intense, emotional, and in my opinion a fitting send off for Kirk.Performances. William Shatner is not the star, his screen time is precious, but his bravery to take this part and putting his ego aside is clearly refreshing. He is still charismatic, and iconic as ever. Patrick Stewart's intensity knows no bounds, and he was the perfect choice to take over in the movies. I love the guy. Malcolm McDowell is a great foe for Stewart, and I was glued to the screen every time he was on it. Not many people can play a madman like him. Jonathan Frakes is likable, and enjoyable to watch as Riker. Rest of the cast does fine.Bottom line. This is an entertaining entry to the Star Trek saga, and many people underrate it as far as I'm concerned. It ranks among my favorites in the series. Recommended 7/10",Star Trek - Generations

35,zkonedog,"Could Have Been Great, But Underachieved",5,12 March 2017,"Much like the first Star Trek film, ""Star Trek Generations"" could have been great, but ultimately failed to create the high drama and emotional character development that fans of the series crave. The idea of Captains Kirk and Picard interacting in one movie seemed like box office dynamite, but did not live up to the billing.The basic plot of this film has the ""Next Generation"" Enterprise crew investigating a strange astral phenomena in which people can live out their greatest fantasies. When that phenomena falls into the wrong hands, the conflict of the movie is set.The movie fails to deliver in a few key areas: First, the introduction and ultimate fate of the returning James T. Kirk seem quite anticlimactic. In what should have been a monumental ""passing of the torch"" moment, the writers/producers instead chose to play down the ""cannon"" aspect in favor of the script at hand. Second, the ""Next Generation"" crew all seem a bit wooden in their performances, almost as if they were taking themselves too seriously on the big screen, when they should have just remained true to their silver-screen characters.A few scenes actually work quite while, however, saving this movie from complete oblivion. The opening of the movie, featuring a fish-out-of-water Kirk watching a new captain command the Enterprise, is classic, while Captain Jean-Luc Picard's ""fantasy life"" in the astral phenomena adds depth to his character. Also, the emotion-chip plot line involving Data was humorous (even though Data's ultimate decision on the chip doesn't come until later on in the Next Generation TV show).To conclude, ""Star Trek Generations"" is an average movie that is very uneven throughout. Some scenes with Kirk are great, others are anti-climatic. Some information regarding the astral phenomena is interesting, while at other times it is just confusing. If you are just watching the Star Trek movies, I would recommend this film in order to become accustomed to the Next Generation cast. If you already are a ""Next Gen"" fan, this movie can easily be skipped en route to the next installment in the movie series.",Star Trek - Generations
36,johnnyboyz,"In shifting to a new crew and doing well to pay tribute to passing stars, the film is fittingly about characters moving on whilst identifying and acknowledging the past.",7,1 November 2011,"If there was this stiff, stale sensation about the final few films featuring the old crew then 1994's Generations is the required breath of fresh air. Episode six was driven by intergalactic espionage, assassination plots, false-accusations and the-like; the hero of the series, Captain Kirk, was accused of murder; had to escape from a prison and then go all-around-the-houses in trying to prove his innocence in what was a film that shot all over the shop without there necessarily feeling like anyone was really going anywhere. Generations takes us to places we do not envisage; it opens our minds a little more and is often rife with that wonderful sensation we often get when we watch a science fiction and just flat out do not know, in a good way, where it is we're heading. It is not bogged down by frameworks nor is it plot heavy with looming peace talks; inter-species distrust and a sense of general emotional detachment. That's not to say the old crew were wearing out their welcome; on the contrary, it felt like the time had merely come for them to step aside, and the transition into the new crew led by Patrick Stewart's Jean-Luc Picard, with bits and pieces of the old crew popping up here and there, is both an energising and seamless one.At its core is a study of grief, two people grieving out of their loss for loved ones from further back in their lives. Where one man, this being Picard, identifies the grief and both expresses and acknowledges it away from the demanding; ego-driven world of space flight and commanding a crew, a certain Tolian Soran, played by Malcolm McDowell, can only proceed to do everything in his power to numb his emotions and 'escape' into an existence in which hurt does not exist. When Picard sits in his quarters and speaks of his family's great tradition, the blot on the jotter is revealed to be his own son's early death and that he is the last of his genetic line; the room and its interior at this point bathed in strips of light and shadow alluding to a more humble nature to the man away from the established patriarchy of running a space crew on a ship. His ability to let things go and accept the situation stands in stark contrast to Soran; a man who does his utmost to recapture the past when it is revealed his family was killed by another intergalactic species. He strives to manoeuvre a strip of energy known as the Nexus, which blunts the pain and falsifies the grieving process, towards him which costs thousands of lives on nearby planets and acts as the antithesis to Picard's way of dealing with death.Preceeding the main event is a launching of a brand new Enterprise ship, the talk of retirement in the previous film to which Kirk and his crew alluded has been followed up with; Kirk, the returning William Shatner, takes it on himself to travel on its maiden voyage as a guest. Through some difficulty, and some extraordinary space vacuum activity, McDowell's aforementioned character beams aboard round about the time Kirk is sucked out into space and thought to be dead, when a tear in the bowels of the craft removes him out into yonder. Decades later, Picard and a new set of crew members are enjoying the healthy ethic that they share whilst on board an 18th Century galleon boat in a simulated video game. In spite of the nature of how we first see them, there is less of a team effort in this edition; the utilisation of the Enterpsie's crew in the past canon sees characters the here and now equivalent to Bones and Spock pushed aside for this one man of Picard to take centre stage - many of the other crew remain anonymous with the most memorable thing about anyone being LeVar Burton's Geordi La Forge, if only for his funky eye-wear.A certain Brent Spiner plays a certain Data, a character with striking facial features which has it look like it may belong to an infant's toy doll after having left out in the sun for three-too many days – a character that alludes to what it might have been like had Kevin Spacey ended up playing Kryten, of British sitcom Red Dwarf-fame. The character makes for a meek substitute of Leonard Nimoy's iconic series stalwart Spock, a being of whom, in spite of not being of the flesh and blood variety, is unable to feel emotion and does his best to provide an outlook on the situation. There is a sub-plot involving him and his attempts to become more human via some programming which doesn't quite work, and this secondary optimisation detracts from the film's centralised hypothesis about raw human emotion and how we deal with it.With grief at the centre of the project, and some unfinished business to do with Kirk tantalisingly set up at the beginning, Generations weaves gently but competently in and out of a number of sub-plots and other such involving content. In a sense, the director of Star Trek: Generations, David Carson, was in a lose-lose situation; guiding the return to the big-screen for a franchise as big as Star Trek, for the first time following the removal of the crew whom had started it, all comes across as quite the task – to paraphrase the immortal-to-some line about going where no one had before gone, this was a treading into new territory; had it broken down, one wonders if the thing would have had much of a life left. It is to he and his team's great credit that Generations comes off as good as it it; an involving adventure film with an exciting story, the required amount of conflict between a strong lead and a good villain which neatly rounds off certain members of the old crew's presence to boot.",Star Trek - Generations
37,filipemanuelneto,A new breath,6,3 April 2017,"This film is the seventh of the franchise and renews almost everything, as we advance in time to follow the adventures of Captain Picard, played by Patrick Stewart, the new protagonist. Okay, in this film William Shatner still makes a brief appearance, but this happens in a context that the script clearly specifies, and which may (or may not) make logical sense. Either way, the film deserves a positive note regarding the use of new special effects and technologies. They have proved to be very useful to the film. I also liked the new improved sets and costumes. As far as the actors' work is concerned, Stewart does not disappoint, giving us a good participation, but I also really enjoyed the performance of Malcolm McDowell as the villain and Brent Spiner as Data, a humanoid robot who has difficulty understanding feelings. The franchise, thus, takes up a new breath, and this is a good promise for the future.",Star Trek - Generations
38,digitalbeachbum,Meh,5,7 March 2021,"Star Trek is my favorite, over Star Wars and other space genre. I thought this script could have been better. The casting is fine, the FX are fine, but the script really needed some work. There were too many plot holes and continuity errors.It's hard to imagine that this is almost two decades since this was out in theaters. The cast and crew are so much older and so am I, neither of which has held up over time that good.",Star Trek - Generations
39,funkyfry,under-rated Trek,7,12 November 2007,"""Star Trek: Generations"" was a lot of fun to see in the theater and it's still a fun experience despite not feeling quite epic enough to justify the burden placed on it  resolving the character arc of Captain James T. Kirk (William Shatner) from the original series of films and passing the torch to the new crew from the TV series ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" and their captain, Picard (Patrick Stewart). I think the film has been somewhat unfairly dismissed by some of the old-school Trek fans and people should consider taking another look at it without that burden weighing so heavily on the film.Granted there are some problems with the execution of the story. There are a lot of loopholes here depending on how demanding a viewer you are. For instance, if Kirk and Picard had failed to stop Soren, the Nexus would still have swept them up and taken them back and they could simply have tried again at least until they were both killed. The Klingon ship that we see early in the story is destroyed much too quickly  yes it is an older ship that can't match up to the Enterprise but here, just like in ST VI, it's a bit too much to ask the audience that one shot destroys it. A much bigger problem actually IMHO is the fact that we have Guinan (Whoopi Goldberg) talking the Nexus up so much (""once you're there, you're not going to care about anything. All you will want is to stay in the Nexus"") and we have McDowell at his usual creepy pitch selling us on how obsessed he is with the Nexus, so it's very underwhelming to see the place. Picard's version of the Nexus looks like a throwaway scene from a Dickens novel, and it's much too easy for he and Kirk to decide to leave the Nexus. ""It's not real"" says Kirk  so why does it feel so real for Guinan and Soren? So IMHO the Nexus was a great idea and a great motivation for Soren but is undermined by poor execution  in the end we don't see any reason to think it's any more tempting than the holodeck.However it's all pretty forgivable when you consider how nicely all the themes from Soren, Picard and Kirk coincide in the concept of the Nexus. ""Time is the fire in which we burn"" says Soren  and it resonates for us because we know that Picard and Kirk have both been preoccupied with their legacy, in Picard's case a deep sadness due to the death of his brother and nephew. Stewart's acting in the scene he shares with Troi (Marina Sirtis) is fantastic, some of the best you will ever see in a sci-fi movie (though not subtle). I thought the theme was powerful enough that it would have made this a top Trek movie if the execution of the Nexus and the final battle was just a bit better.The secondary story involving Data using the emotion chip was interesting but also could have been handled better in some ways. I think some people don't understand that Data's horrible jokes are supposed to be horrible, and are only funny because they're so bad. But even so, I think they went a bit too far with it. I did think the scene with Data and Geordy on the space station when Data began to malfunction was handled very well, and I laughed at Data's first experience with alcohol.Unfortunately most of the supporting characters just don't have a lot to do in this one, which is one of the problems generally speaking that undermined the Next Generation series when it went to film. On television the series was groundbreaking, its multi-episode character arcs leading the way for shows like ""X-Files"" and ""Buffy"" that would come later. But none of this is possible with film  I do respect the decision to try to develop Data with the emotion chip, but it's simply impossible to have every member of this crew do something memorable or important. Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden) gets thrown in the water 15 minutes in and then virtually disappears. The rest of the crew crashland (nice FX with the miniature work on this scene) on some other planet and never become involved in the action for the last 30 minutes of the film.But heck  Stewart and Shatner are great together and the scenes with the 2 of them are a Trekkie dream come true. I like how Kirk's death was handled  the desert planet reminds you of great episodes of the original show that were shot in the desert. Trek fans will forgive me for not remembering the name of the episode but there was that one with Kirk fighting the green lizard guy in the desert. His last words (. Oh my..) are 1,000,000 times better than some ""dignified"" speech. And it's fitting that Picard is the only witness to his death and the only mourner at his funeral. McDowell is one of the stronger villains in the series, second only to Montalban's Khan and Pullman's Chang. Sometimes in the later years McDowell played victims too ham-fisted (i.e. Blake Edward's ""Sunset""), but here there's something exciting and compelling in his eyes  it's as if he's searching desperately for something that he knows he will never find. I liked it better than any of the subsequent Trek:TNG films because it was the most cinematic and original, had very good music and effects, and you can't beat Picard and Kirk as a screen hero duo.",Star Trek - Generations
40,GOWBTW,A Fusional Sci Fi Flick!,9,15 December 2008,"Here's a Star Trek movie that combines action, drama, comedy, and science fiction rolled into one. ""Star Trek: Generations"" is a next generation movie of the Star Trek:TNG(The Next Generation) saga. Captain Jean-Luc Picard(Patrick Stewart) commands the crew of the USS Enterprise. during the battle against the Klingons, he is beamed down where a madman(Malcolm McDowell) decide to cause some galactic mayhem. The big help Picard gets is from a Enterprise Captain of the past: Captain James T. Kirk(William Shatner). Kirk was allegedly killed during a battle years earlier, and the same man is there as well. So both Captains take action. The real kicker is when Lt. Commander Data(Brent Spiner) gets an emotion chip put in him, and begins to experience on being human. Data's actions really speak louder than words, and his long time of knowing what to feel really comes out. This movie is really corny in some spots, only a few of the original crew of the Enterprise were there. No Uhura, no Spock, no Bones(DeForest Kelly, he was retired from acting at the time) only the daughter of Sulu appeared. This one focused on the Next Generation crew. 4 out of 5 stars!",Star Trek - Generations
41,FiendishDramaturgy,Calculated treachery,9,25 October 2003,"Generations. For me, this is a sad movie. The movie itself was excellently done, and just as good as all the others, but the content just ... saddens me.With Sulu's daughter at the helm of the Enterprise-B, the crew of ""living legends"" accompanies a skeleton crew of trainees on a press blow out of a short jaunt, which turns into a distress call/rescue mission which morphs into something very serious.Meet the Nexus; a ribbon of the time/space continuum which has the ability to create and destroy anything in its path; to take it/them to different ""whens"" and ""wheres.""This is the unfortunate end of Kirk's reign as Captain of the Enterprise. He disappears into the Nexus and into an eternity of peace on his old Iowa farm. Or so it seems.I wanted him to die in battle. Be assassinated in his sleep. Anything noble. But instead, he was given a peaceful eternity. OK, fine. I have no choice but to deal with it. While I respect Piccard as Captain of the Enterprise, he will never be James Tiberius Kirk. But this is the end of the old series and the beginning of the new; hence the name ""Generations."" If you are a fan of these movies, a collector of anything Star Trek, this is a definite needful addition to the set. This is the movie which ties the two series together.Meet Captain Piccard and crew. I'll assume you're already familiar with them and I won't bore you with the details. Over the years, I have developed (if somewhat begrudgingly) an appreciation for this new crew and cast of players...and, while I still mourn the loss of the legends I loved, I look upon them as new neighbors, of sorts; with a certain measured withdrawn fondness.With the addition of an ""Emotion Chip,"" DATA is now an emotion-ridden, diseased AI personage, but in light of his not being able to grasp the concept of humor, he is willing to stake it all in his attempt to be more human.Also, this is the movie that first realized the potential we all knew was in the Enterprise, to separate into a ""saucer section"" and the remaining half of the ship. You could always look at the Enterprise and just knew that, ""Hey, there's kinda like a flying saucer on the top front half!"" But this movie actually did it. It marks a milestone in the series and in this line of movies. I also must say that the way they brought Kirk and Piccard together was sloppy and puerile. They both deserved better treatment and so did we, as fans. They did the best they could, I suppose, but in ignoring Nimoy's suggestions to counter the plot misconfigurations and obvious premise problems, I can honestly understand why Nimoy backed out of the director's chair and left it to someone else. Had they listened to him, this would have been a much better enterprise...pun intended.I love the movie, and enjoy it...now. But when I first saw it, it infuriated me with the off-handed disposal of Kirk and his illustrious career.Kirk is dead. Long live Captain James Tiberius Kirk! It rates an 8.9/10 from...the Fiend :.",Star Trek - Generations
42,freemantle_uk,"A solid, mid-ranking entry in the franchise",7,7 September 2016,"Star Trek Generations was the first feature film to star the New Generation crew and the only film to team up the Original Series and New Generation actors. 'Generations' ends up being a fun, if mid-ranking entry into the film series. It has a premise that would be more suited to fan-fiction yet the film puts it off with the idea of the Nexus, a world of euphoria and having Soran so driven to return to this place by destroy solar systems to achieve this. It made Soran one of the best villains in the Star Trek film series, played brilliantly by Malcolm McDowell, someone who's physically and mentally a great threat. His plan involving his star destroying weapon reminded me of Genesis in 'Wrath of Khan'. Patrick Stewart and McDowell doing battle is a delight to see.The opening is a solid, exciting sequence, where an undermanned Enterprise has to go on a rescue mission and Kirk having to resume command of the Enterprise, something he had done in Star Trek: The Motion Picture and has some nice little character moments like Kirk touching the Captain's chair longing to get back into action. Shatner is criticised as an actor, but knows how to play Kirk.There are problems with the film, the worst being the film's attempts at comedy with Data having an emotion chip implanted into his head. It drags the rest of the film down - it could have reduced the comedic moments and still been a family friendly sci-fi film. It was also obvious Scotty and Chekov were meant to be Spock and Bones but the filmmakers were unable to get them.",Star Trek - Generations
43,JoeB131,Hands down- The WORST Trek film,1,2 March 2009,"This was truly the worst of the Trek films, brought down by its own hubris. Let's look at its sins. * Killing the Greatest hero in SF for no good reason. * Destroying the Enterprise-D for no good reason. * Killing Picard's loved ones for no good reason. * Turning Picard into a crying sissy-boy. * Turning Kirk into a jerk. * Turning Data into a babbling idiot.In some ways, time has undermined this film. In 1994, one could see TNG and TOS as almost equals. Since then, the Next Generation crew has diminished in stature, while the Original Series crew has risen. (Why else would they recast it in ST-XI?) But the reality is that this just isn't a very good film and never will be. It's dramatic flourishes are diminished by how badly they are handled. Come on, not only killing Kirk, the greatest hero that Science Fiction has ever produced, but then killing him with SCAFFOLDING? It like having John Wayne break his neck tripping over the spittoon in the saloon! The films other fault is that it is too derivative of TNG. You'd have to have seen those episodes to know who these characters are.",Star Trek - Generations
44,Jackbv123,Better the first time,6,23 August 2017,"I enjoyed this movie thoroughly back when it came out. I was immersed in the story which was fairly good especially when you take into account the things that were done to appeal to original TOS Trekkie's. So much Star Trek tradition. There are some original ideas in this story. The Nexus and the idea of getting back is a different kind of take on time travel. Of course there are a billion holes in the story too, but after all, it is Star Trek and time travel, but none of the holes affect the enjoyment. Uniting Kirk and Picard - who can resist. Learning some Kirk and Picard backstory - also good. What does affect the enjoyment, especially if you have see this before is the acting. Give Brent Spiner the award for the worst comedy ever in any Sci-Fi movie. I wonder if that was Spiner or the direction. Stewart overplays the sequence with Kirk and Picard, but seems like Shatner was dead on. The old TOS cast overplayed their parts but I suspect that was intentional. The TNG cast, especially Stewart, had highs and lows, and overall they were probably OK.",Star Trek - Generations

That doesn't translate to movies very well, during the series the stories could be told including every major character.In this movie it's no longer the intimate family of the next generation.Unfortunately it also includes Captain Kirk and whoever original Star Trek actors they could get, but Spock wasn't having any of this film and Deforest Kelly couldn't be in it either. So we have Scotty and Chekov, but no Sulu or Uhura.And also the fact that we don't get to the next generation characters until a quarter of the way into the film.And then we step onto the enterprise and it is as if half of the crew were hijacked from deep space nine, why were half of the actors wearing original next generation uniforms and the other half wearing deep space nine uniforms? And ill fitting ones at that.And this was not the best story with which to destroy the enterprise D, in fact they destroyed the enterprise D in favor of the enterprise E, after the enterprise D has survived much worse then an attack from an old Klingon bucket of bolts?And then you have the last appearance of Guinan after being absent from the next generation for a whole season, last being seen in season six ""Suspicions"".Her character was considerably weakened here- At one point this character was poised to defend herself from Q, here she is nothing more than a refugee from a planet of long lived humanoids. Of course this whole ""ribbon"" thing possibly explains why she knew whenever alternate timelines were intersecting... but why in 100 blazes would she show up in Picard's personal fantasy?But the worst sin of this film was the destruction of the ship, on the lame excuse that ""it did not look good in wide screen"", wrong, we see the enterprise D in the last episode of enterprise and it looked just fine in widescreen format.But of course the landing of the saucer section was something that we needed to see at least once.Also, too short. The first Star Trek motion picture was almost 3 hours long. But I loved it, I thought it was interesting, and visually it was the best thing I had ever seen.Starting with the wrath of khan, Star Trek films have been shorter, I think the producers don't realize the true Star Trek fans will sit in a theatre and watch a three hour Star Trek film, Especially if it were a next generation film and a debut next generation film as this was.This film could've been special, should have been unique, but it just wasn't.",Star Trek - Generations

Nevertheless, we get a nearly 20-minute helping of Kirk, Scotty and Chekov that feels squeezed in; not unlike those gentlemen were into their ill-fitting Starfleet uniforms. Once TNG crew finally make their first appearance in their own movie, we get a story that really isn't quite big enough for their new medium. Like 'Insurrection', this tale feels better suited for episodic TV. That is until they shove Shatner back out on stage for the final act to remind us this is a big budget feature film (even though his final act fisticuffs are rather small scale stuff).The logic of the premise--even the internal logic--is dubious at best, but 'Generations' is competently directed, moderately entertaining, the cast doesn't shrink on the larger stage, and I give props for the Enterprise crash sequence, which is a pretty awesome bit of F/X work.",Star Trek - Generations

The flaws and deficiencies of the previous installments' plots are already taken over by a new,superior conception.If the fantasy in ""ST 7"" still reminds the far-fetched and flippant schemes from ""ST 5"",etc.,in exchange it already has a fine plastic accomplishment and an intelligent treatment of the theme,easiness and fluency,infinite charm,abundant fun.The intellectual and reasoning level improves steadily,gets better from one movie to another.The same is true for the plastic level (the first ""Star trek"" movies were,sometimes,slatternly,sleazy,worn down).The same theme (the quest for happiness,youth) appears first in ""ST 5"",and it is a stupidity,done without any sense of concreteness;then,it will be retaken and treated in far better and more concrete in ""ST 7"" and ""ST 9"".""ST 9"" is delightful,clever and most appropriate in representing the theme.As the treatment of the theme progressively gains in value,from one installment to the other,the theme itself is more and more modified and modeled to fit the frame of humanity,by loosing the fantastical features.The search for a ""God"" very unmeaning conceived becomes the search for the Nexus (and McD. does a lot for giving this search the human density needed),then it becomes a peaceful planet of the youth,more tangible and falling under the senses.The conception's progress is obvious.First,a fake ""God"" (in ""ST 5"");then,an illusory ""Heaven"" (in ""ST 7);then,an earthly Paradise (in ""ST 9"").A show with no women is no fun.It simply can't do without women.Even if it is a show for boys,it doesn't mean women must lack.""Star Trek"" excels in showing very womanly women.Mrs. Sirtis should have got more than this bit part.The Klingons from the ""Bird of prey"" behave very much as our present day humans would,it's almost like an irony (probably unintended) to see these sordid beings act the way the men of today do.

48,Enchorde,For the fans...,7,15 March 2011,"Few movies can deliver the sense of exploration and adventure as a Star Trek movie (or series for that matter) can. Star Trek Generations is at the same time the first movie with a new crew of the new Enterprise, and actually starts with the christening of the ship and its maiden voyage, with Kirk, Chekov and Scotty along as honored guests. The need to answer a distress call from two ships trapped in a gravitational distortion make the maiden voyage a nightmare. Enterprise is almost destroyed, and Kirk is a causality. Many decades later Picard and his crew answer another distress call with connections to the same distortion.Star Trek Generations is in many ways a classic Star Trek movie with all the elements that a Star Trek movie should contain. But it is not one of the best Star Trek movies, very much due that the story is divided. The main plot is about the distortion and the scientist that threatens several planets when he tries to use it, but it also got a subplot of a Klingon uprising. The subplot is not developed very much, it seems to be there mostly to justify an element of space ship action. I feel that perhaps would the movie would have been better if they have focused and developed just one of the tracks.Star Trek fans will in no way be disappointed, and as I consider myself as one among them, I liked Star Trek Generations. However I don't think the movie will convince many non-fans.7/10",Star Trek - Generations

Sometimes sloppy, sometimes poorly put together, this movie was a solid effort on a rather difficult subject. I can only say this film was gateway of what was to come.",Star Trek - Generations
50,davidmvining,Thematic depth and a TV series structure come together reasonably well,7,22 November 2019,"As time has gone on, I've enjoyed this film more and more. I'll never love it (it's far too flawed for that level of appreciation), but there are depths to this films thematic material that really only grow with repeat viewings.As implied, the movie's far from perfect. Data's story is very much a B-story that is more appropriate for an episode of The Next Generation instead of a subplot in a feature film. It doesn't feed into the main story either directly in plot mechanical terms (except to extend one plot central scene a bit), nor does it even intertwine thematically with the central ideas at play (and there is a very interesting theme running through the film, which I'll get to). Despite my disliking of the question form ""Why doesn't he just..."" when talking about a narrative, it's really hard to not justly ask that of the antagonist. The Klingons are mostly just extra and an excuse to destroy the Enterprise D. And most of the returning original cast is wasted.Still, when we do the work that the filmmakers should have done, brushing away the excess stuff, what you have is the story of three men: James T. Kirk, Jean-Luc Picard, and Dr. Soran, who all respond to eternal, consequence free life in very different ways.Kirk's might be the most interesting. From the moment he's pulled into the Nexus, the magical space ribbon that transports people to a form of paradise, to the moment Picard approaches him for help in his adventure, no time has passed. He simply disappeared from the Enterprise B, appeared at his house chopping wood, and then Picard walked up. Presented with this reality where time means nothing and so does any danger, Kirk finds himself automatically feeling empty. There's a small gorge where he drives his horse to jump over. It has terrified him every time he did it in real life, but in the Nexus he felt nothing. He's a man of action, but the action needs to mean something. There's needs to be danger, consequence, and the potential for injury in order for it to mean something. Once presented with the façade of the Nexus, the Nexus loses all power over him and he easily walks (or rides) away.Picard's is interesting as well, but mostly because of how it shows him to be a complete wet blanket. Presented with the life he knows he wants, a wife and several perfectly behaved children housed in a mansion as old as the books he keeps in his quarters on the Enterprise D, all Picard can really think about is the mission he left behind. He already knows, walking in, that the Nexus is a fantasy and that his priorities lie with duty. The moment he's presented with his own personal paradise, he wants to walk away to try and punch a man about to blow up a star because it's the right thing to do.Dr. Soran's reaction needs to be extracted a bit from context, but all the required materials are there to make the right connections. His part might have benefited from a slightly expanded bit, perhaps a look into what he sees inside the Nexus. Still, we know that he lost his family, a wife and daughter, to the Borg and that before the Borg he wouldn't hurt a fly. But, two things happen. First, the Borg kill his wife and daughter, and then he's presented with a tangible paradise in the Nexus, which James T. Kirk helps rip him from on his passenger-like voyage on the Enterprise B that opens the film. It's easy to suppose that what Dr. Soran sees in the Nexus is his wife and daughter, alive and happy again.All three are presented with the, effectively, same fate, and they all three react very differently. Kirk rejects it because it's not dangerous enough (there's no thrill in the jump he knows he'll make). Picard rejects it because he has a job to do somewhere else. And Dr. Soran is willing to not just kill, but massacre entire worlds to get to it.So, Dr. Soran and Thanos kind of remind me of each other. In both instances, there are other solutions. Dr. Soran could buy, borrow, or steal a shuttle and fly it into the Nexus (supposedly), but instead he decides to blow up stars, killing hundreds of millions in the process. Thanos could create double the resources, but instead he would rather kill half the population of the universe. In both instances, the alternative methods of addressing their problems are valid, but they also miss the points of the characters. Both Thanos and Dr. Soran have been driven to complete psychopathy by their needs, desires, and ideals. The point isn't that there's another potential solution. The point is that they are so blinded by their end goal that they can't see another solution, and that the solution they've come up with is acceptable to them. Dr. Soran maybe could find a shuttle to fly into the Nexus, but he says he's spent eighty years trying to find another way into the Nexus and blowing up stars is the only one. If Picard offered him a shuttle from the Enterprise, Soran wouldn't take it because he's been so blinded by his desires that he can't see another solution.The same thing goes for Picard's choice of return point. Instead of going back eighty years to beam Soran back onto the ship caught in the Nexus, or back a week to put Soran in the brig when he was under Picard's command, Picard choses to go to the moments just before Soran shoots his missile into the star. His duty blinds him to other possibilities than to the one right before him. He won't risk messing with timelines too much, instead he wants to make a minimal impact. It's his duty as a Starfleet captain to find that kind of solution.This balancing act between the three characters is fascinating and I find it really involving. It's also only about, maybe, 50% of the movie. If that 50% had been expanded to fill a full movie, I think I'd love Generations. Instead we have Data's subplot to virtually nowhere and the Duras sisters, holdovers from The Next Generation that probably should have been a few more spots down on the list of antagonists from the show to bring back. It's not that the other 50% is bad. It's largely functional and sort of okay. Really, Generations is about 50% great movie and 50% okay movie. So, I've grown to average out the whole thing to a solid three stars.",Star Trek - Generations
51,Spleen,Television without the ads,3,11 January 2000,"I have some fondness for Star Trek, but it belongs on television. `Generations' is what you get when you take an inferior tv episode and pump it up until it's movie-sized.Star Trek (I'll speak of the four series as if they're one) SOMETIMES has clever scripts: this isn't one of them.  Remember Whoopi Goldberg, with her risible hats?  How my heart sank whenever she appeared...  Well, it's finally revealed where her fashion sense comes from: a transcendent paradise called `The Nexus', which few people can summon up the willpower to leave - it's like Earth, but without so many mosquitos.  The main plot has something to do with The Nexus.  I won't say what because then I'd have to start talking in pseudo-scientific jargon myself.  There's also a sub-plot in which Data gets an emotion chip, which, like so many sub-plots from the land of television, does not bear on, illuminate, comment on or work in counterpart with the main plot: it's simply THERE, because ... well, ya gotta have a sub-plot.  There's probably a textbook ratio of sub-plot screen-time to real plot screen-time.  I'll bet `Generations' conforms to it.`Generations' is a clumsy, ill-conceived splodge of all things that the makers felt were required of them, with screen time carefully reserved for Guinan, Picard, LaForge, Crusher, Crusher, Data, Worf, Riker, and Deanna Troi, not to mention - and believe me, THIS is forced - Captain Kirk.  See characters you know and love look dowdy and out of place on the big screen! I stopped watching Star Trek movies after this.",Star Trek - Generations
52,alexanderdavies-99382,A farewell to the original cast members. The acting partly saves this confusing film.,6,10 June 2017,"""Star Trek Generations"" is the last we see of the ""Original"" cast members of ""Star Trek."" Even then, not all of them make an appearance. What we do get, are Kirk, Scotty and Chekov appearing at the beginning of this film - who for the last time - attempt to assist in a distress call when a new Enterprise is launched on her maiden voyage. Kirk officially is listed as dead but not all is what it appears....... The opening 15 minutes of ""Star Trek Generations"" is based approximately during the era of the original Enterprise crew. Then the film moves 78 years into the future, where we are introduced to ""The Next Generation"" crew in their movie debut. The plot is a rather confusing and rambling one. The narrative doesn't make a whole lot of sense as some scenes are just cobbled together with no sense of continuity. The cast from ""The Next Generation"" series is a good one and they are being wasted here. Brett Spinner in particular is marvellous as Data, he made the character his own. Malcolm McDowell is a great villain, he always could be slightly sinister. It is the return of Kirk that makes this film worth sticking with and I personally cheered at the cinema when William Shatner made his return. Kirk wasn't going to retire as a Starship captain easily! He proves this by agreeing to assist Picard after they are both trapped inside the Nexus. He and Patrick Stewart have good on- screen chemistry and it is unfortunate that they didn't work together in another ""Star Trek"" film. It is interesting how two completely different eras from Starfleet are united in battling the mad scientist in question (Malcolm McDowell). This isn't a dreadful movie but it certainly isn't a classic.",Star Trek - Generations
53,The_Film_Cricket,"Weak, wobbly fan gratification . . .",2,15 March 2012,"The wonderful thing about Star Trek: The Next Generation as a television show is that it doesn't lean on a lot of fan gratification. The writers and producers of that show have the imagination and the confidence to put together a show with such a keen human touch that it doesn't need to pander to us. It doesn't need a lot of references to the original series. It is, I think, a show that stands very well on its own two legs.I wish – oh how I wish – that I could say the same about Star Trek: Generations a movie that is clumsily and hap-haphazardly put-together in an effort to join Captain Jean Luc Picard and Captain James T. Kirk on screen together. I don't object to the joining of these two science fiction icons, but the story on which their meeting is mounted is nonsense. It doesn't matter how you get there . . . just GET THERE! Star Trek: Generations, opens with a scene that takes place in the 23rd century, and seems superfluous if you examine the rest of the plot as a whole. Three members of the old Enterprise crew, Kirk, Chekov and Scotty are on hand to witness the maiden voyage of the new Starship Enterprise (that's Enterprise 'B', if you're keeping track). No sooner are they out of space dock then a distress call informs them that two ships are in danger of being destroyed by something called a ""Nexus Ribbon"", an energy anomaly that looks like a volcanic crack in space. The Ribbon threatens to rip the Enterprise to shreds, and Captain Kirk makes his way to the engine room to reprogram . . . something that will allow them to get away. The situation is diffused, but in the excitement, Captain Kirk turns up missing.Shoot forward to the 24th century and we find the crew of the Next Generation (that's Enterprise 'D', if you're keeping track) facing the same problem. The ""Nexus Ribbon"" is about to destroy a research space station loaded with people. They are beamed aboard and, among them, is a crazy-eyed scientist named Soran (Malcom McDowell) who demands to be sent back. Captain Jean Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) won't hear of it. Some pep talk with the ship's bartender Guinan (Whoopi Goldberg) reveals that Soran is willing to destroy planets and moons in an effort to hitch a ride on this Nexus Ribbin. Inside it, she explains, is like being ""inside joy"", a place where you can live out your wildest dreams, a place where time and space have no meaning. Uh-huh.Here is where I have a logical question. Why is Soran obsessed with hitching a ride on the Nexus Ribbon to live out his fantasies when he lives in an age that provides the holodeck, a recreation room that can replicate pretty much anything you can imagine? Doesn't it seem like a colossal waste to spend all that time causing stars to go supernova in order to hitch a ride to an anomaly that might have the potential to kill you when the technology to do the same thing already exists? The question plagued me all through the movie.I was also unhappy about the subplot involving the android Data (Brent Spiner) who is easily the most interesting and curious character on the show. Here he reveals his desire to have an ""emotion chip"" implanted in his head, to make him feel what human beings feel. Question: Why? Why with all this Soran business going on is he so worried about his emotion chip? When he gets it hooked in, he becomes insufferable, laughing out loud at inopportune moments and making inane jokes. Worse? The plot involving Data and his emotion chip are left unresolved.Finally, I was plagued by questions about why it was necessary to have Captain Kirk in this movie to begin with (other than the obvious). Kirk reappears inside the Nexus Ribbon and has a conversation with Picard that is so innocuous and so wholly tilted toward the plot that any wonder what these two giants might talk about in the downtime is left for you imagine. The movie is no help. Finally, when they team up to take down Soran, it is on top of a rickety metal scaffolding where the battle comes down to the ancient formula of western fist fights. Here we have a series dedicated to reaching out into the galaxy and finding out what lies beyond and this movie whittles down to the oldest cliché in the book. Don't Star Trek fans deserve better? Don't they deserve something more than this for all their years of loyal service to this enterprise? This is a movie that feels like a very weak episode of the series. Where's the grandeur? Where's the wonder? Where's the excitement? Where's a script doctor when you need one?",Star Trek - Generations
54,brando647,The Next Generation Films Start with a Fizzle,6,2 January 2011,"STAR TREK: GENERATIONS should have been a better film. It was a momentous occasion as the crew of the original Enterprise (well Kirk, Scotty, and Chekov...) pass the torch to the crew of the Enterprise-D. It's a shame that the first movie from the NEXT GENERATION crew arrived with a fizzle. The film focuses on a temporal nexus that passes through the galaxy; those who come in contact with the nexus are treated to their greatest desires. Captain Kirk (Shatner) disappeared on the first cruise of the Enterprise-B when it encountered the nexus on a rescue mission when ships containing El-Aurian refugees become trapped in it's grasp. 78 years later, the crew of the Enterprise-D encounter the same nexus when Dr. Tolian Soran (McDowell), an El-Aurian obsessed with returning to the nexus, begins demolishing stars to divert it's path. Now the crew of the Enterprise-D must stop Soran from destroying the sun of the Veridian system and killing billions in his quest.The crew of the NEXT GENERATION series are given their chance to shine and it doesn't go well. All of the characters fans have come to know and love are here and I suppose they all do admirably with what they're given (with one exception). Shatner's at his best in his final appearance as Kirk and it was a treat to see James Doohan and Walter Koenig popping in for a short cameo at the beginning of the film. Particularly Doohan, who seemed genuinely upset when it appeared that Kirk had died saving the ship. The film's villain, Tolian Soran, is the ever-awesome Malcolm McDowell. He does a great job as expected, and he could've been even better if utilized in a better story.Now, fans of the series won't be entirely disappointed. The film feels as if you're watching a two-part episode of the show. I'm sure this was to be expected with a director and writing team who'd worked on it often. The problem lies in the fact that this is a movie, not a TV show, and we expect a more cinematic experience. With the exception of some great cinematography from John Alonzo, this could've passed for your average season-ending two-parter. The filmmakers attempt to amp up the cinematic feel by adding some subplots that run through the movie. Captain Picard (Stewart) copes with the recent deaths of his family as the result of a fire at their vineyard, and it plays in somewhat well with the mortality theme presented by the nexus plot. Meanwhile, there is also an entire subplot dedicated to Data (Spiner) deciding to finally install his emotion chip and the zaniness that results. Laughing fits, cowardice, Mr. Tricorder, and Data's first curse word (that I'm aware of)...honestly, the film could've done without it. It adds nothing to the story and only serves to give Brent Spiner more to do with his continuing role in the features.Seriously, I would've been all right with all of these flaws if the film didn't grind to a complete halt the moment Picard is drawn into the nexus. Around halfway through the film, the movie is running at an exciting pace: the Enterprise-D is under attack from a Klingon Bird-of-Prey that has found a means around it's shields and Picard is battling Soran to the end on the surface of Veridian III. Then, suddenly, it all lurches to a stop while we celebrate Christmas with the Picards in the captain's nexus experience. From there, we get a slow sequence of Picard trying to convince Kirk to return to reality to help him battle Soran and it just drags on. No excitement whatsoever. There's the ""ooh and aah"" factor of Picard and Kirk face-to-face but the feeling passes and we're left waiting for something, anything to happen to get us interested again. The entire last half of the movie is anticlimactic and killed the experience for me.At least it's not a terrible movie. It's just not all that memorable. The film has some highlights and, as long as you're all right with Data's wacky shenanigans, the crew does their usual good work. It was just a weak story (and the writers agree...it's true...listen to their commentary) wrapped around the sole purpose of passing the torch from original series to it's successors. For those who are watching the film for the first time as an introduction to the NEXT GENERATION films, try not to hold GENERATIONS against them. It gets better with FIRST CONTACT.",Star Trek - Generations
55,Terryfan,Two Captains One Destiny in this epic Star Trek The Next Generation Film,9,26 June 2015,"Star Trek The Next Generation prove itself to be a great successor to the original Star Trek and lasted seven seasons on TV becoming one of the greatest TV series to ever grace Television.Now in 1994 following the series finale we are presented with a brand new motion picture for Star Trek and it's the first film with The Next Generation crew. While some might have mix feelings about this movie I enjoy it very much since I first saw it in theaters with my family as a young child. It just one of those films I never forget what it was like in theater to watch this movie. Remains one of my favorite films I saw in theatersAll of the cast members from the TV show reprise their roles Patrick Stewart as Captain Picard, Jonathan Frakes as Commander Riker, Brent Spiner as Data,LeVar Burton as Geordi ,Michael Dorn as Worf, Gates McFadden as Dr.Beverly Crusher and Marian Sirtis as TroiIn this film we get to see how the characters develop from the TV show into the motion picture. Also as a bonus we get three of the original series cast members returning for the film William Shatner as Captain James T.Kirk, James Doohan as Scotty, and Walter Koenig as Chekov The film main antagonist is Dr.Soran played by Malcolm McDowell. Fans praise this character for how far he would go to accomplish his goals and Malcolm's performance helps complement that. His character had some of the best quotes of Star Trek. And the film is fill with great quotes from Picard, Riker and others.This film has that feel of The Next Generation TV show that's how I felt when I was in the theater it felt like watching a long episode of the series which isn't a bad thing at all because it complement what makes the Next Generation great for Star Trek fans. The film features some very well done acting as each actor brings something to the table, Patrick and Malcolm stole the show with their respected performances. All the others did a good job as well that's why I like this film is that the acting is pretty solid.The plot of the film is really good to me and I enjoy the story of the film.The music of course is top notch every score in this film is well deserved of respect you can appreciate the work that went into the music department. All the music here tells the story of the film.The special effects are perfect along with some of the most tense moments in the history of Star Trek it still impresses me how they created the Ships. This movie really does a impressive job with the effects and why Star Trek holds a lot of power to making strong effectsAction scenes in this film are some of the best I have seen in a movie and still gives me a rush of excitement that I had in theaters. The film also features some good comedy to help with the mood of the film While it might have been mix for most I still love this movie because it was the first Star Trek Film I saw in theaters and everything about this movie deserves a little more respect than it got it also one of the best films of Star Trek and one of my favorite films in general. With strong acting, tense action scenes, powerful music, intense plot and a movie that gives you that feel of Star Trek this is your filmI give Star Trek Generations an 9 out of 10",Star Trek - Generations
56,dunmore_ego,Generation Pap,6,21 September 2009,"The Death of Kirk! You know these filmmakers are going to hell for this, right?STAR TREK GENERATIONS was meant to showcase the TREK TV spin off, THE NEXT GENERATION; instead, the singular event on all our minds is how Kirk is going to eat it. The legacy itself defeats the movie. But if it were not for the legacy, Kirk's downfall would be even less of an anticlimax than it already is. Captain James T. Kirk is but a minor tangential character in this mix of annoying and innocuous characters. Meanwhile, there's a bad movie going on...Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) of the 24th Century and Admiral James T. Kirk (William Shatner) of the 23rd Century join forces to battle a scientist named Soren (Malcolm McDowell), who is destroying stars and planets to catch an energy ribbon called The Nexus, buzzing through the universe and ""destroying"" everything in its path, while transporting the people it kills to their personal fantasy realms - you know, like the Catholic version of Heaven. Movie opens with Chekov (Walter Koenig), Scotty (James Doohan) and Kirk attending the maiden launch of Enterprise-B. Crowded by paparazzi on the bridge, in a strange mix of art-imitating-life, they meet unseasoned Captain Harriman (Alan Ruck - Cameron from FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF; hope he doesn't do to the Enterprise what he did to his dad's Ferrari...).Almost immediately, Enterprise-B must rescue two ships caught in splashy special effects - The Nexus. After beaming refugees aboard, Harriman has no idea how to outrun the Nexus (which is why he left all the planning to Ferris) and abdicates command to Kirk, who plants his ever-widening girth in the Captain's seat with a dopey grin on his face, before he begrudgingly gives it back to Harriman and reverts to his Action Hero idiom to save the day. Exactly like Spock's death in STAR TREK II, Kirk is killed by a McGuffin: he runs downstairs to Do Something Jargony To Some Jargony Thingy - and is blown into space...78 Years Later...We meet the crew of THE NEXT GENERATION (TNG) in a tiresome sailing ship sequence that only TNG fans' mothers could love. Then Captain Picard leads Riker (smug Jonathan Frakes), Data (silvery Brent Spiner), Geordi (visored LeVar Burton), Crusher (insipid Gates McFadden) and other passengers, on a rescue mission to a dead space station, where they pick up a scientist named Soren, who immediately causes trouble with his devious Nexus plans and British accent. Guinan (Whoopi Goldberg) appears with a funny hat any time Picard needs information about the Nexus. She explains that if you fall into it, ""you're not going to care about anything and not going to want to come back."" But it's the old SUPERMAN II argument: ""You'll lose your powers forever"" - until he wants them back, at which point, he goes and gets them. So too, when Picard finds himself in the Nexus as the father of five kids from a Charles Dickens novel, he retains all his faculties and decides to leave.Guinan actually appears in the Nexus with Picard, driving the movie further into B-Movie dipping sauce with each idiotic line, ""I am onboard the Enterprise, but I'm also here... Think of me as an echo of the person you know."" Then she tells Picard he can simply leave... to any point in time he chooses! So when ships are ""caught in the Nexus"" and destroyed, we know for a fact they ARE going to be all right - so what's all the fuss? ""It isn't Real,"" says Kirk later. But what IS real after Death? Would a robe and wings do it for you?Meanwhile, unimportant subplots seem to be happening in another movie: Data (TNG's emotionless Vulcan analog) implants an emotion chip and becomes almost as annoying as Jar Jar Binks; ugly Klingon bitches with large ta-tas ally with Soren, kidnap Geordi and blow up Picard's Enterprise, which crash-lands with all the NEXT GEN overactors. 78 years later, and still not a seatbelt in sight.The crashed Enterprise is sucked into the Nexus, portrayed as a horrible, explosive death - but Funny Hat Exposition Lady just said it was Paradise... If you have the power to go anywhere in time, Jean-Luc, go back to when you first picked up Soren - and don't. Why go back to the moment of desperation as seconds tick away, trying to stop Soren firing a missile into the heart of a star? If you can pick up Kirk to help you, why not pick up your whole crew? Picard leaves his Dickens Thanksgiving and meets the Priceline Negotiator in the Nexus, convincing him to help stop Soren; whereupon Kirk and Picard stop Soren through the technological method of fisticuffs. Even Leonard Nimoy would call Kirk's death ""gratuitous."" An unnecessary marketing ploy, which ruined an otherwise mediocre movie. Innocuous demise aside, let me get this straight: if Kirk had NOT died, would he have lived out the rest of his life in the 24th century alongside THE NEXT GENERATION? In his book, Star Trek Movie Memories, Shatner tells of the tear-jerking moment he felt his torch was being passed: when replying to Picard asking for his help, ""Who am I to argue with the Captain of the Enterprise?"" STAR TREK VI: THE UNDISCOVERED COUNTRY was undoubtedly the best of the Original Cast Treks, and if we could boldly go and call STAR TREK GENERATIONS an Original Cast Trek (for its inclusion of merely three Original Cast), then it is surely the worst. Nonetheless, Kirk's dying words sum up the odysseys of STAR TREK Compleat: ""It was fun.""And who are we to argue with the Captain of the Enterprise?--Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).",Star Trek - Generations
57,Op_Prime,Okay film,8,27 June 1999,"Sadly, upon first viewing it, I did not consider it the best film of the series. It seemed to lack action and seemed more philosophical. On the plus side, Data getting emotions, the battle between the Enterprise-D and the Klingon Bird of Prey, and the teaming up of Capt. Picard and Capt. Kirk were great. Overall it was good.",Star Trek - Generations
58,mentalcritic,Star Trek 6½,1,27 July 2004,"The end of the original Star Trek was probably a very hard thing for Paramount to deal with. Fans go on about how hard it was on them, but consider Paramount and Viacom for a moment. Suddenly, their sacred cash cow was gone, and the Next Generation series, which was in its fourth season by the time the original crew were put out to pasture, was not living up to the enormous international sensation it followed.When the first Star Trek feature film was released, it dared to do something different by offering a very scientific and researched future. Sound effects in space were kept to a minimum, gadgets were barely used, leave alone acknowledged, and the focus was almost entirely upon human drama. It might have presented one of the most unbelievable scenarios a science fiction film has ever been based on, but it grounded that scenario in just enough reality to make it work. Which is where Generations ultimately loses the plot.The whole opening of Generations just cheapens the end of The Undiscovered Country. The original cast got a beautiful send-off with a major Roddenberrian goal accomplished, their signatures recorded on film, and their model spacecraft riding off into the sunset. It was a high note that could never be equalled. But some moron at Paramount thought ""let's bring back some of the old cast and do a crossover, it will make a fortune"". Given that Scotty seems to have adopted the mode of speech associated with Spock, it is quite apparent Leonard Nimoy told Paramount he'd rather do something that qualifies as creative. As one critic said, let them go people, it's only a TV show.Like Insurrection, Generations shoots itself in the foot by basing itself on a classically uninteresting premise. A wave of cosmic energy sweeps through the universe, and those who come into contact with it are trapped within their own unreal fantasy land until they can get out of it. Putting aside the premise of locational heroin for a moment, it doesn't bode well that this is pretty much all I can remember about this dull, uninteresting film. Given the adventures that Kirk has had in previous outings, to rewrite his history so that he goes out on a note like this is insulting to those who paid good money to see the previous six films.I'll admit it, I've never found the Next Generation cast a tenth as interesting as the Original Series cast. But that is hardly a fault of the cast. Patrick Stewart has floored me before as Charles Xavier in both of the recent X-Men films, so it isn't like he is incapable of making a well-written role work. Marina Sirtis almost screams that she could do so much more with a better-written part. As for Malcolm McDowell, well, this is the guy who made a name for himself in one of the most controversial adaptations of all time. He certainly can't have too many agents left to fire.In the end, Generations suffers from exactly the same problem as the TNG series. Too much gloss, not enough cerebral activity. Again, scientific credibility is stretched to its limits. When Kirk is sucked into the Nexus, the idea that he is the only one to go is laughable at best. What makes the rest of the film fail is that the writer and director don't seem to realize that a feature film is not a two-hour television episode. One cannot rely on endless scenes of people sitting down and conversing to carry the film, but this is exactly what they try to do. It is for that reason that this load of swill, which would have been much better as a three-episode arc in the television series, gets a one out of ten from me. It isn't the worst in the series by a long shot, but it comes off that way when all the penalties are tallied up.",Star Trek - Generations
59,Beta_Gallinger,"Sometimes entertaining, but sometimes a bit bland as well",6,4 December 2007,"I saw this movie on TV nearly ten years ago, being familiar with both the original ""Star Trek"", and ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" at the time. From what I remember, I liked it at the time, but obviously had to watch it again to see what I would think of it now. So, I finally saw it for the second time (for the first time in many years), after watching its six predecessors in order, and while it was no HUGE disappointment, I was not as impressed as I was with most of the previous ones.The Enterprise-B, a new ship, sets out on its maiden voyage, with a new crew. Also aboard are three retired guests; Chekov, Scotty, and Kirk. When the ship is forced into a rescue mission, the three guests help out, but sadly, Kirk does not survive! 78 years later, Jean-Luc Picard is the captain of the USS Enterprise-D. When a distress call comes from an observatory station, Picard and his crew head over and manage to rescue Dr. Tolian Soran. Unfortunately, the crew are all unaware that Soran has evil plans for destruction! Picard learns that the scientist is doing this in an attempt to get back to the Nexus, a place of total bliss! In order to stop Soran, Picard must enter the Nexus, and meet Captain Kirk! ""Star Trek: Generations"" has received its fair share of criticism from fans, for the plot and the idea of Kirk and Picard meeting. Well, I guess I agree to a certain extent, the plot is a tad awkward, but in my opinion, it's not as bad as some say it is. In fact, I thought Kirk and Picard meeting was one of the good parts. However, I also found that too much of the film is somewhat dull. Now, there is quite a bit of excitement in the film. There's also some good humour, mainly in the scenes with Data and his new emotion chip, which sometimes causes him to act silly. However, the film is not a consistent as I had hoped, lagging behind for too long at times.Of the six movies featuring the original ST crew, I would say this 1994 follow-up is superior to the ""The Motion Picture"" and ""The Final Frontier"", but inferior to the rest. While polarizing with fans, I think it has enough to make it above average, but not by much. If you hate the idea of Kirk and Picard meeting, then it's obviously best to avoid ""Star Trek: Generations"". If you like that idea, then this is probably worth a try, even though you could still be disappointed by certain other aspects, probably including some that I haven't mentioned.",Star Trek - Generations
60,phubbs,Star Trek: Generations,5,26 January 2015,"A new film, a new generation and the beginning of a newer franchise. I don't like these shorter one word film titles though.The film kicks off with the handing over of the Enterprise from Kirk to a new younger crew. You half expected the next generation crew to be at the hand over but not so. Shatner looks uncomfortable in this sequence (in my opinion), it does seem as if he would be quite happy to carry on being the immortal space legend Kirk. It seems like a painful break for him and the original cast members that join him...Doohan and Koenig.The same could be said for myself as a viewer, I've never been a Trekkie but I have always enjoyed the original cast. This new film starts off well and in familiar territory with the beloved Kirk Scotty and Chekov under pressure, but it quickly falls flat as we hesitantly hand over to the new duller greyer crew.The problem with the new generation is quite simply the new crew, Jesus they are bland! so very boring, the only character I think has some interest is Worf. A Klingon male that has joined Starfleet and worked up the ranks, could almost be seen as a turncoat to his Klingon people, interesting.Other characters in the film are all rather meek and uninteresting. McDowell's character isn't really very threatening and fails to crank up the tension when on screen, hardly a villain to remember. I must also admit I always hated Goldberg in Star Trek, she just seemed to big a name to have involved plus she really doesn't fit this type of genre if you ask me.Other personal issues I have with this film and the new crew is the character of Data. A tremendously annoying character that looks like a makeup mistake, terrible effects when we do see his innards and whose humorous moments are rather forced and cringeworthy. His whole development during this film are along the same lines as Kryten from British sci-fi comedy 'Red Dwarf'...yet not as good I might add. Of course my opinions are personal preference within the Star Trek universe.Anyway the plot is pretty dull frankly, an odd choice of adventure, at least up until the Nexus takes Picard whilst part of the Enterprise crashes (film highlight borrowed from 'Star Trek III' perhaps?). Things do get a little more interesting then especially as we get Kirk back. Still many questions arise during these sequences, what exactly is the Nexus? an afterlife of some kind? where does it come from? how does it work? etc...How come Picard can see and talk to Guinan? and how come Kirk had only just arrived there despite him entering the Nexus 78 years prior? Lastly, how come they can both simply decide to leave the Nexus to where ever they wish?Maybe I missed these points I dunno but luckily it doesn't detract from the fun of having Kirk and Picard double up in a pretty cool franchise generation cross over. Alas they still decide to kill off Kirk which I think is a mistake because he and his classic crew got a bloody good send off in 'Star Trek VI'. Seeing as he gets killed here you tend to think the character would deserve yet another royal send off with a big military funeral attended by all previous characters in a special episode or another film. Seems an anti- climax to just leave it at this after all that has gone before.As for the effects well of course they look sharper and bolder but most of the shots were CGI created with only a few models used. For me this is a shame and adds to the shiny plastic fake look of the film just like its TV counterpart, models always look better. The whole film did feel very much like an outstretched TV episode, more so than previous film offerings if you ask me. Like I said the plot is thin and could easily have been a simple episode (seeing as the effects aren't exactly much different). There really was no big silver screen stand out moment, the space battle against the Klingon sisters was quite good but that's all you get.Overall I think this was a disappointing start for the next generation of Star Trek films. I admit it was always gonna be a hard sell to me as I never followed Star Trek after the original crew and never liked the next gen cast/crew. Despite that its still a very mediocre entry with a lot of dialog which could almost be construed as time wasting of sorts.Seeing Kirk and Picard together was damn good I have to say. Seeing the Shat back in action in the finale despite weight and age really puts a smile on your face, Trek fan or not. Lets not forget it was a three way battle including McDowell, that's a pretty awesome trio of legends duking it out right there folks. Just a shame the rest of the film didn't live up to the action and excitement in the finale. It took the inclusion of Shatner to bring that excitement I might add, that tells you something.5/10",Star Trek - Generations
61,CharltonBoy,Dispels the myth that the odd numbered Trek films are poor,8,15 June 2001,"This in my opinion is one of,if not the best Star Trek movie ever made. **Spoiler Alert** This is the film that sees  captain Kirk and Jon Luc Picard meet in a thrilling storyline that incorpirates moments like the destruction of the Enterprise(which is superbly shot),Data being given his new emotion chip(which has some very funny moments) and ultimately the meeting up of the captains which leads to the death of Kirk. Ironically this is the best display of acting from William Shatner that we see in any of the Star Trek film.

63,The_Movie_Cat,"""Doctor, I must confess, I do not understand why someone falling into freezing water is funny""",4,11 June 2000,"Of course, in the world of Generations, it isn't funny at all. I think it's a basic human right to be able to sit through a film without being painfully embarrassed by a lame, excruciatingly unfunny ""comedy"" moment. That right was stripped from me by Data's so-unfunny-you'll-want-to-die ""lifeforms"" song (complete with double-takes and mugging), plus the two Klingon women doing the oldest joke in the pulp SF universe with ""human females are so repulsive"". Take me to sick bay and get my sides sewn back up.The major problem with Generations is it's arrogant assumption that the audience is familiar with the Next Generation crew. We first see them on the not-at-all-explained-for-casual-viewers Holodeck. Here Worf is forced to walk the plank, and I don't mean Marina Sirtis. The real flaw is that, taking the lead from the original crew, the new cast seem to feel they have to fill the ""loveable, comedic"" quota. Yet for the po-faced Next Generation crew, being loveable and comedic doesn't come easily, a factor that also dogged, to a far lesser extent, Insurrection. It's no surprise that the straight-played First Contact is the most successful movie outing for this crew. The Next Generation then: Data's amateur dramatics with his emotion chip, the woodenness of Dr. Crusher and the charisma void that is Jonathan Frakes. Only Michael Dorn, Levar Burton, Whoopi Goldberg and, of course, Patrick Stewart, emerge with any dignity. Stewart's role is greatly extended at the expense of all others, a pity as he's given little of interest to do.The film's screening formed part of a Star Trek evening, following on from a broadcast of the original series episode ""Where No Man Has Gone Before"". In the space of an advert break we'd gone from a young, dashing Shatner who really tried, to a podgy, decrepit actor who doesn't care any more. And neither did his wigmaker. Kirk's absence from 75 minutes of the film seriously weakens its framework, his tenuous link and involvement in the plot stretching it wafer-thin. I won't give away the end, but this is hardly a heroic tribute, his eventual action in the plot lasting no more than ten minutes. As the big baddie, Malcolm McDowell stays (just) the right side of ham, though his sloppy science plan of star destruction is a flimsy premise on which to hang a movie. And did I miss something, or do we never get to find out how Soran and Guinan were expelled from the Nexus in the first place?Kirk was the fourth original series character to make the jump into the world of the Next Generation. An aged McCoy had appeared in the pilot, while a near-ageless Spock had made the crossing for a two parter. Scotty had his own forty-five minutes after being frozen in time and revived by the new cast. This is another part of the problem. Where seeing convincing special effects was a novelty for the old crew, the state of the art graphics are nothing new for a television series that was averaging expenditure of $3 million an episode. Generations lacks the epic scale to convince us that this is a major motion picture, and not some knocked-up cast off that could have been used as a televisual double episode.The quality of the various Trek films is variable, though as a rough guide I would say they all hover somewhere between the 5-7 mark. This one, however, is by far my least favourite, the only one I actively dislike. Smug and barren, given all the elements at it's disposal it's amazing how it completely fails to utilise them.

64,Squonkamatic,Welcome To Wasted Opporunity City,4,21 April 2010,"Been home nursing an emergency tooth extraction over the past week and nothing was able to assuage the misery like wallowing in ""Star Trek"". I watched a bunch of the cartoon shows & made myself come to grips with THE FINAL FRONTIER (re: Shatner's movie), which managed to be fun when regarded as a study in applied narcissism. But boy how I dislike GENERATIONS, and won't be watching it, though I decided to try and deal with my feelings about it once and for all.I think its a cop-out, a cheap sloughing off of responsibility that should have been handled with graceful dignity. This is not the way that I will remember Star Trek. I say that because for me the essence of Star Trek is James Tiberius Kirk, watching him grow & learn. I switched on the spoiler warning disgronifier in case you are not aware that Captain Kirk dies in this movie, and for absolutely no reason at all. It was as if to say his learning curve was arbitrarily being concluded in a re-write, even changing the way he died from the original script (two versions were filmed) for reasons that have never been explained to my satisfaction.I had learned to like TNG and her crew by the time the film premiered, though I think that Tourette's Guy is probably right when he addressed what Brent Spiner is up to these days. Google it if you don't know what I mean, I always despised Data. He was a decent plot device and they did come up with at least one great episode where they got him a sweet girlfriend with nice legs, but enough with the emotion chip already, OK? It's clear that his model was incompatible for the input, they had long milked the gimmick dry, and it turned him into a jerk.I did like watching the saucer section crash, which in a theater looked about as believable as Godzilla destroying Yokohama, enhancing the enjoyment. The producers knew we would get off on seeing it and were so kind as to show the mayhem twice, providing the film with it's two most interesting sequences, thoughtfully shot from different angles for variety. But the rest of the treatment left me cold. I didn't give a damn about the Nexus, which sounded pretty swell compared to graduate school. I went with my fiancée at the time, smuggling in a flask of blackberry brandy so we could drink a toast to Kirk when he finally bought the farm. Turns out the bottle was 3/4's empty by then due to the draining experience of watching the film. Which looked muddy and rushed, filled with subplots that went nowhere, cameos by assorted Next Generation personalities which distracted from the focus, and a forced sentiment that was at odds with my own feelings about the show.Which was great, don't get me wrong! Heck the TNG episode ""Tapestry"" is one of Star Trek's finest hours, whichever series that turned up in rocked. It was just that the series run had come to an end with a superb show-stopper of its own. There was no unfinished business left to attend to, no need to ""pass the baton"" as producer Rick Berman put it, by having the Original Series crew and Next Generation crew appear in a film at all. The classic crew made a rousing, emotional exit in the very satisfying THE UNDISCOVERED COUNTRY. Kirk had said himself in the soliloquy that it was the final adventure for that crew, but by forcing the issue Shatner became the proverbial drunk who wouldn't leave after the party was obviously over.Which in many ways turns out to be the case as Shatner used his studio muscle to not just get himself written into the picture but threatening to direct at one point. The whole subplot involving Kirk is a distraction from the rest of the story and feels superimposed, though yes, the horse riding scenes with Picard are nice. But if they had to happen at the expense of the dignity of Kirk's character then they were as unwelcome as his demise. Shatner also bullied himself into the film specifically to have his character killed off heroically, then posited himself to come back in the 2009 prequel film, as if. I now realize he deserved to be left out of that one, having cast his fate already. It was about time someone made Bill keep his place in the line after such an unnecessary curtain call.Kirk deserved a better movie to go out in, or rather his own movie if it was that damn important. And I say it wasn't: Why kill off anyone in the Star Trek universe at all if there are an infinite number of ways to bring them back? Emotional death scenes suck, and it made the film perfunctory or formulaic in my eyes, trying to fix what wasn't broke in the first place. On its own the Next Generation crew's story was pretty good, and from what I've read a lot of what they would have been doing ended up being chopped out to make room for Kirk's scenes back when A-list talent movies at least didn't run three friggen hours. This crew was short changed, eventually coming back to make at least one good feature in FIRST CONTACT, though by then my heart just wasn't in it anymore in part due to GENERATIONS.So I don't know. I thought maybe I had confused my feelings for the woman I had gone to see this with the film itself, which I have seen since on home video and didn't like any more. Actually less, wishing I'd had more of that blackberry brandy or at least a six pack of Romulan ale. Here is a Star Trek movie that will drive a classic series fan to drink, and that isn't ever a pretty thing.4/10",Star Trek - Generations
65,TheNorthernMonkee,Old meets New in mediocre adventure,7,6 September 2004,"SPOILERSSo it came to pass, from one crew to another. Like everything else in this world, the ""Star Trek"" movie franchise evolved. Gone went the entire crew of the original series, gone went Spock and McCoy arguing whilst Kirk sat in the middle. To replace them came the successful crew of the Enterprise NCC 1701 - D. We lost Spock's logic and gained Data's android take on humanity. We all have a favourite crew in the ""Star Trek"" universe, Whether we love the classical touch, or the well thought out adventures of ""The Next Generation"", or the violence of ""Deep Space Nine"" or even the almost camp style of ""Voyager"", everyone has their own favourite. Eventually though, it was obvious that Kirk would disappear from the big screen, to be replaced by Picard. In ""Star Trek: Generations"", this would happen through a few complicated twists and turns, but it would work well and would be a nice way to pass on the torch.In this seventh film of the series, but the first to star the second crew, both Kirk and Picard are eventually united in a quest to prevent the evil Doctor Tolian Soran (Malcolm McDowell) from destroying millions of lives for his own personal goals. Combining the styles of the classical with it's replacement, we are given a union which fans have dreamt of for years.Perhaps the main problem from the offset is that this feels more like a gimmick than a proper story. It feels like the writers were fully aware that Kirk and his crew had achieved a decent send off in ""Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country"" (1991), yet they chose to abandon this in favour of bringing Kirk back one final time to team up with Picard. It seems interesting that at the beginning of the film, along with Kirk only James Doohan's Scotty and Walter Koenig's Chekov were featured. Whilst Spock made a brief cameo in an episode of this second series, as did Dr McCoy (a suitably brief conversation with Data in the pilot episode), only Doohan and Koenig were featured in this film (on a different note, Doohan had also received a cameo episode in the series where he teams up with Commander La Forge) and it is worth considering whether this was intentional or whether some of the original crew declined the possibility.In ""Star Trek: Generations"", there are some superb scenes where the franchise is alive and well, these are limited however, with Commander Data (Brent Spiner) receiving most of the highlights, most notably his lifeforms song. At the same time as with the majority of the films staring this crew, key members feel under utilised. Whilst Troi, Riker, La Forge, Data, Picard and Worf will get key story elements in the series of films, it seems strange that Gates McFadden's Doctor Crusher never really is given much to do. Part of the beauty of the original series was the way in which Kirk interacted with the members of his crew in which he had a strong history, in the ""Next Generation"" by contrast, the one member who Picard has the most history is Doctor Crusher. This storyline is never focused upon however.Anyway, in this one film, there are some beautiful lines which make the audience laugh. At the same time, Kirk's role might be gimmick based, and it might devalue the climax of the previous film, but for what it is, it is done with great tact and is a moving end of the Captain's involvement. Therefore to summarise, for what it is, ""Generations"" is worth a watch. As a way of unifying the two captains, it works well. As a way of introducing the second crew to the Big screen, it's not bad. As a way of destroying an old ship to allow for a new one, it also works superbly. However, compared with so many other films in the ""Star Trek"" catalogue, it's a mediocre effort which could have been better.",Star Trek - Generations
66,russem31,What happened?,6,3 December 2005,"Star Trek VII: Generations - Stardate: 48650.1After not only the spectacular Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country and a great send off for The Next Generation crew (the final episode All Good Things . . . was a proper finale for the Next Generation TV Series), you would wonder how they could possibly get it wrong with the first feature for The Next Generation crew. But lo and behold, they hit that mark! This ""adventure"" was equal to an average Next Generation TV episode (All Good Things . . . would have made a better first feature). Again, since my focus is always on music, I will comment - while Dennis McCarthy the composer did a great job with the TV series, his score isn't ""filmic"" or memorable enough for a feature score. And I like many others I know was VERY disappointed what they did with the beloved Enterprise-D RIP. An okay 6 out of 10.Trivia note: we see Data's cat Spot here as well as the emotion chip he decided not to use at the end of the TNG episode ""Descent"". We also see the crew uniforms changing from the TNG era to DS9 era outfits. There's also a saucer separation that takes place (as it did in the TNG series). And, Lursa and B'Etor from the TNG series make an appearance.",Star Trek - Generations

68,perfectbond,A Trek lover's dream?,6,4 February 2003,"The prospect of seeing Kirk and Picard together salivated the mouths of sci-fi fans 9 years ago. Unfortunately the film was a relative disappointment for Paramount. Malcolm MacDowell, while a great actor, was given a stock villain to play. He does remarkably well considering the uninspired character given to him. Another annoying facet of this film is Whoopi Goldberg's Guinan. She is not exactly the most photogenic actress and the new age revelations she keeps spouting wore on my tolerance as well. Yet another problem I had with this film was the absence of too many of the old crew. To compensate Kirk and Picard were given disproportionately more screen time. The film then became not a crew of explorers encountering the unknown but more of a Batman and Robin (I am in no way knocking these two characters; I just think Star Trek has an altogether different dynamic) teaming up to stop Two-Face adventure.

70,timdalton007,The Disappointing Generations,4,11 February 2014,"Twenty years on, looking back at Star Trek: Generations is quite odd. It's placement in the history of the franchise was unique coming just after the end of the Original Series films while The Next Generation, which had recently come to the end of its TV run, was about to begin its own series of films. What would be better than to bridge the two sections of the film series then by featuring the two in a film together? With that as both starting point and promotional point, Star Trek: Generations was released to theaters. Yet the finished film has proved to be one of the lesser regarded Trek films. Why is that?The film was written, directed and scored by the production team of The Next Generation TV series and that ultimately was its biggest problem. Generations, as a film, feels like little more than a two-part story from the TV series translated to the big screen. Outside of the opening 15-20 minutes of the film, its structure and pacing is far better suited for TV. Watching the film, one can sense where the ad breaks would go and find one or two places where the first episode cliffhanger would go. The film also does, as the TV series would do, try to find moments for all the characters to contribute something to the plot, which leads to some odd moments as well (such as Crusher briefing Riker and Worf in sick bay of all places). There's also a tendency in the film to break up important scenes by suddenly shifting tracks and trying to do a character moment inside of it with the two biggest offenders coming in the film's first hour. The result is jarring to say the least and breaks up the flow of the film immeasurably. That isn't the only problem though.Where the TV origins are most apparent though is how the film starts picking up elements of Next Generation continuity. Data's emotion chip as well as the appearance of the Duras sisters are the two prime examples, things which work if you're a fan of the TV series following those threads but for anyone else coming in (or indeed even for a casual fan of Trek such as myself) they can be a bit odd. The way that Data's emotion chip is handled as well, in that it's used for virtually nothing but cringe-worthy comedy moments the entire way through the film, doesn't help matters either. The lesson here is that what works in a weekly TV series doesn't necessarily work in a film, especially one aimed at casual fans and a larger audience. Perhaps the worst side effect of that though is what it does to the opening 15-20 minutes of the film. Though those opening minutes are arguably the best of the film, ultimately they fill like a time filler to simply set up the end and bring the film up to length. It doesn't help that Scotty and Chekov, despite the performances of both James Doohan and Walter Koenig, are written so bland they could have been played by anybody (and indeed were originally intended to be Spock and McCoy, the latter explaining why Chekov rather randomly asks about the Enterprise B medical staff and then goes to sick bay). It sadly means that the best minutes of the film feel tacked onto it instead.The film does have its pluses though. As well as the Trek films' usually strong special effects, the film has some of the best cinematography in any film from the franchise thanks to the efforts of John A. Alonzo. The film also has some strong performances including Patrick Stewart's Picard and Malcom McDowell as the film's villain Soran, a character so single minded as to be apathetic rather than evil. It also features some of William Shatner's best moments as Captain Kirk, especially in the opening sequence on the Enterprise B where Kirk first deals with being a guest and then throws himself willingly into the action and his final scene is one of the film's few highlights. Despite some of its better elements, overall Generations is one of the most disappointing Trek films. The film's structural issues, odd pacing, over-reliance on using threads from the Next Generation TV series make the film feel like a two-parter from the TV series with an added prologue to bring it up to movie length. Indeed, looking at the film now, it isn't hard to imagine this film as the finale of the TV series with the actual finale (All Good Things...) as the first Next Generation film instead. Frankly, I think it would have been better that way.",Star Trek - Generations
71,Bogmeister,ST FILM SEVEN: Time Stalks Kirk & Picard Outside the Nexus,7,7 April 2007,"This film follows ""The Undiscovered Country""(91), the last to feature all of the original Trek cast, also functioning as a follow-up to the TNG series, which ended a few months earlier. So, there are a lot of elements to bring together, or attempt to, into a cohesive whole - a challenge that was probably next to impossible. This is, largely, a wish fulfillment dream for the Trek fans, namely an answer to the proposition 'what if Kirk teamed up with Picard?' The film represents the differences between this film series and others, in that much of the plot and themes are essentially dictated by the fans. The writers were given certain plot points that were mandated to be part of the story and their job was to somehow write around these: Kirk meets Picard; Data gets emotional; Enterprise crashes; Kirk...meets his end? The writing is adequate, but due to the constraints, there were quite a few clumsy aspects to the overall story. There is an unusual scope to the film: the first 18 minutes take place in the 23rd century, with Kirk, Scotty and Chekov (the last appearances for them) on the new Enterprise-B. This is a nice section, almost like a mini-movie or episode within the film, with our old guard crew definitely retired (tho I always felt Chekov had a good 10 years left in him). Then it transits to the 24th century, to Picard, Riker, Data and the rest of the crew of Enterprise-D.This transition in itself is not bad, but the writers had to come up with a way for Kirk to go forward and team up with his 24th century counterpart and using the by-now-stale method of traditional time travel was out. So they came up with the Nexus ribbon, an intriguing space/time phenomenon which mirrors the concept of the film: a wish-fulfillment dimension where/when anything goes, anything can happen. It addressed the problem of how to get Kirk and Picard together, but is sufficiently vague and even hazy in its conception that it comes off as simply hasty writing, not the cleverness we hoped for. The threat faced by Picard and crew is the somewhat grandly villainous Soran (McDowell, fiendishly gleeful as is usual for him, but not entirely suitable for the tragic aspects of his character), whose plan to enter the Nexus involves destroying an entire solar system. Soran is teamed up with a couple of Klingon sisters from the TNG series and these actresses actually give the better performances in the film. The pace is pretty good, with enough action to offset the lengthy subplot about Picard's personal tragedy, which mirrors Soran's - parallels abound. The key battle scenes in space here echo those of the 3rd Trek film, in which a smaller Bird of Prey Klingon ship once again gains the upper hand over a more powerful Starfleet vessel - I suppose being a sneaky dastardly alien race has its advantages in both the 23rd and 24th centuries.But, it actually works to the film's favor, establishing a darkly ironic tone for the usually level, sometimes bland Trek universe. After seven years of evading destruction from all manner of cosmic menaces on the TNG series, the great ship is laid low by these cloaked skulkers, plotting their deeds from an outmoded vessel (the Enterprise-D's downfall was an edict from higher powers at Paramount, in reality). Likewise, after even more years of eluding all manner of death, Kirk appears to have used up all his good fortune. It seemed to me that, after exiting the safety of the Nexus, Kirk was doomed to fall, no matter what; he would've misstepped somewhere on those mountains even without Soran attacking him - all his cards had been played. Of course, as a longtime fan, I would've preferred Kirk survived and gone off into legend in the same way Scotty did on the TNG episode ""Relics."" But no, the filmmakers were hampered by rules and lack of imagination, a bad combo for such a series. Rules were created for the Nexus, for example, which sweeps over the planet and takes Soran & Picard along with it, but leaves the Enterprise crew to die with the planet; so it only swept over that small part of the planet - convenient. Wild science fiction with loopholes.Kirk and Picard interact in much the way we would expect and it's a great exercise for the two seasoned actors, Shatner and Stewart. If only the setting wasn't so mundane - cooking eggs in a kitchen. The budget limitations, rushed quality and not thinking things out enough shows in these sections: by rights, no one should be able to leave the Nexus. The audience has to make allowances to feel better about it all: starship captains are made of different stuff. They'll get out. But, if you can get out, would you go back to the moments to just before everything goes to hell? Why not give yourself a day? If Kirk had to die, couldn't it have been on the bridge of an exploding starship or even an exploding planet, to give it some grandness, maybe even some greatness? You can drive yourself crazy with all the what ifs. Some of the themes, related to old age, the brevity of human life and making a difference, though having a 'tacked on' feel, do emerge by the end. And, it's interesting that the antagonist, who rebels against these declared virtues, is himself nearly immortal (Guinan's race is very long-lived); that may be why he instigated this conflict, not knowing the preciousness of a brief life. But, this is what happens when you put together a film as modified by fans - you get a fan film - exciting in many ways, quite illogical in others. That's what Spock might say and he was missing, but I think Nimoy had the same opinion. Next was the all-new crew film on the new Enterprise-E in ""First Contact.""",Star Trek - Generations
72,0w0,"It has Klingons, time-travel & alternate universes, but a script written by a 4year old",5,27 July 2020,"The writing of this entire movie is very 'wishy washy', because it deals heavily with time-travel, and any time that your movie deals with time-travel, then you better have a very very good plot-structure and have all of your ducks in a line because otherwise you not only open your movie up to many more plot-holes but it will also leave your plot/story feeling discombobulated and cobbled-together (and that's exactly how this movie's plot feels... it feels very light in the pants).Also the 'screen shake' or 'camera shake' in this movie is insane... instead of building an 'earthquake platform' to get the desired effect, they simply opted to shake the entire camera and that is not only an extremely 'backyard' way to do it, but it is also disorientating as all hell for the viewer. It's honestly hilarious that they were totally OK with releasing the movie with such a poor production and editing choice made.Apart from that, there's several plot-holes in the movie... I obviously can't go into detail without spoiling certain plot devices, but at least 2 of these plot-holes directly affect the outcome of the movie ie. bad guys winning or good guys winning.Overall, it doesn't have enough action to be a real action film, and it doesn't have enough quality drama or story in order for the film to be considered even worth-while watching.

73,dr_foreman,Unworthy exit for Kirk,3,27 July 2006,"""Star Trek: Generations"" is so aggressively lame that I'm almost fond of it. The direction is flat, the script is weak, the acting is wooden and there are only two or three good special effects (minus the one they stole from ""Star Trek VI""). Yet, for some perverse reason, I felt compelled to buy it on DVD recently. It's oh-so-marginally better than I remembered from my initial 1994 viewing.It's still basically junk, of course. The film has many sins, but chief among them is its dismissive and flat death scene for Captain Kirk, the greatest heroic icon in the science fiction pantheon. (Well...except for Tom Baker's Doctor Who, in my book!) Spock got a wonderful and moving death scene in ""The Wrath of Khan,"" but here poor Kirk is forced to run around in the desert, looking fat and sweaty, as he trades punches with that hammy dude from ""A Clockwork Orange."" It's a weird, undignified exit for Kirk, who has no purpose in the story and no opportunity to really shine as a starship captain.There was, I think, really no need to kill Kirk as part of a formalized baton-passing to the Next Generation crew. Why bother? As it transpires, Kirk is still more famous than Picard and company anyway, and will probably be the star character of the proposed Star Trek XI.""Generations"" has other troubles besides the death of Kirk, though. Dr. Soran's plan to divert the Nexus ribbon strains credibility, as he somehow manages to calculate the precise effects that supernovas will have on a wriggly band of special effects energy! The Nexus itself is silly, too, since it's a rather underdeveloped concept that strikes me as an excuse - not a proper basis - for the plot.There's a distinct lack of thrilling spectacle as well, which just compounds the aura of lameness. Many of the sets and starship models are recycled from the ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" TV series, and frankly don't look good enough to appear in a feature film. Witness, too, the turgid battle scene between the Enterprise D and the Klingon Bird-of-Prey. It's an immense yawner. I suppose the moody lighting throughout the film is nice, though.The showpiece special effects sequence is the Enterprise saucer crashing, which looks either really great or really fake, depending on the individual shot you're looking at. Overall it's pretty good, but its status as a latter-day model shot means it already looks antiquated in this age of elaborate CGI.In the end, this is really just a tepid, slapdash attempt to shoehorn the two Star Trek crews together, without much thought put into really integrating them in an interesting fashion. The production team are clearly not half so talented and creative as the likes of Harve Bennett and Nicholas Meyer, who worked on the best films featuring the original crew.Thankfully, the next Star Trek movie would at least be exciting, and look something like a properly big-budget film!",Star Trek - Generations
74,LebowskiT1000,Loved It!!! Great Transition From Old to New Generation,10,18 August 2002,"Despite some other people's reviews on this site, I thought this was an EXCELLENT Star Trek film.  In fact, this is probably one of my favorites of the films.  I thought everything about this film was above average, the story, the special effects, the acting, the directing...EVERYTHING!I thought the story was absolutely brilliant and quite inventive.  I really loved seeing the two captains fighting and working together.  Also, I love the idea of this place, ""The Nexus"", a place where time has no meaning, you can relive all of your favorite memories and your dreams become a reality. I thought the story was excellent.The special effects in this film were definitely above par!  There are several scenes that just made my jaw hit the floor because they looked so good and were done so well.  I've noticed a few people have complained that they used the exact same footage of the Klingon bird-of-prey exploding that was used in ""Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country"", but I say ""if they're going to use some archive footage to save some money and put that money into the other special effects that they need for the movie, more power to them"" !  Besides, the scene is such a tiny scene in the movie and it wasn't the climax of the film anyway, so where's the problem?The acting and directing are top notch in this film.  I thought all of the actors did a fantastic job.  William Shatner pulls off a great performance in his final Star Trek film, as well as James Doohan and Walter Koenig.  The Next Generation cast does a great job as well, Patrick Stewart, Jonathan Frakes, Michael Dorn, Brent Spiner, LeVar Burton, Marina Sirtis, Gates McFadden and Whoopi Goldberg all pulled off great performances!  Malcolm McDowell did a fantastic job as the antagonist in this film!  I also really enjoyed seeing Alan Ruck and Jenette Goldstein in the film, although they both had very small roles.All in all, I thought this was a great addition to the Star Trek series and a great transition from the original Star Trek crew to the new Star Trek crew.  Also, I love this film because you need to know very little about the original Star Trek films to enjoy this film.  The only thing you need to know is that James T. Kirk (William Shatner) is the star of the original films and that Scotty (James Doohan) and Chekov (Walter Koenig) co-starred. Also...it may be useful to know that Commander Sulu was another one of the original crew members (but not terribly important).  Anyhow, I would definitely recommend this film to any sci-fi fan and to anyone that likes the Star Trek films.  I hope you enjoy the film.  Thanks for reading,-Chris",Star Trek - Generations
75,cariart,TREK Transition Shortchanges Both Crews...,6,28 November 2003,"STAR TREK: GENERATIONS serves neither the original TREK series or the 'Next Generation' crew very well, but producer Rick Berman had a nearly impossible task: to satisfy the fans demanding a Kirk/Picard story, and to please the followers of the popular spin-off. Berman had no desire to see the original cast in any more features (it would be difficult enough to provide ample screen time for his OWN large cast), but Paramount demanded that he create a 'transition' between crews, so he wrote, with Ronald D. Moore and Brannon Braga, an opening sequence featuring Kirk, Spock, and McCoy, with a climax that would supposedly have Kirk 'die' alone, in space, thus fulfilling his prophecy from STAR TREK V.As another link between TREKS, Leonard Nimoy was asked to direct GENERATIONS, a wise decision, as he had worked in both TV series, had directed two successful TREK films, and co-written a third. But after reading the script, he said, bluntly, it was TERRIBLE! He offered suggestions, but Berman, struggling to complete the last episodes of TNG, as well as put the film together, did not want to burn up any more production time on rewrites, politely informing Nimoy to shoot what was written. Nimoy turned down the assignment, showing DeForest Kelley the script. After reading it, Kelley stated that he felt THE UNDISCOVERED COUNTRY was a far more suitable finale for Dr. McCoy, and passed on it, as well. Shatner, getting a HUGE paycheck to revive Kirk a last time, remained committed, and James Doohan and Walter Koenig were hastily called in for the opening sequence (which was why Scotty called Kirk 'Jim', and Chekov was suddenly gifted with medical skills). Kirk's disappearance still packed a wallop, but the absence of Spock and McCoy blunted much of the scene's dramatic power. With TNG director David Carson now in charge, a larger-scaled yet mediocre 'Next Generation' film emerged, with Picard and Data getting most of the screen time, and La Forge suffering the kind of physical abuse that Chekov routinely got in the earlier TREK films. Picard experiences a personal tragedy, and, as he had, far more memorably in the TV series, ruminates about the life he 'could' have had, had Starfleet not beckoned. Meanwhile, evil Dr. Tolian Soran (Malcolm McDowell), having discovered a benevolent entity, the Nexus, that would allow him to 'live' with his dead wife in an eternal state of bliss (a la George Clooney's SOLARIS), decides to destroy a planet to reroute the entity to him (why he didn't just hijack a spaceship and fly into it is not well explained). Utilizing two whacked-out Klingon sisters and their 'Bird of Prey', he soon attacks the Enterprise, and when Picard attempts to stop him on the planet's surface, the captain fails, with the pair sucked into the Nexus.Picard finds himself in the idyllic family life he'd always dreamed of, but, through willpower and the intervention of a 'ghost' of Guinan (Whoopi Goldberg), he comes to his senses, and is told the 'help' he needs to defeat Saran is in the Nexus...in the form of James T. Kirk, sucked into the entity nearly eighty years before... While the 'Meeting of the Captains' offers the 'strengths' of both actors (Shatner shows his signature physicality and cockiness, Stewart, as always, is quiet and intellectual), the scene feels stilted and contrived, enjoyable only when Kirk reflects on Spock and McCoy, and both Captains share a horseback ride (something Shatner had wanted to do since STAR TREK V). Of course, Picard convinces Kirk to join him against Saran (""It sounds like fun,"" Kirk admits).In yet another continuity glitch, the two captains leave the Nexus BEFORE Picard's initial confrontation with Saran (if the Nexus has any power over time, why didn't they just reappear prior to Saran's arrival...or why did Picard need Kirk, at all, if he could have just returned, alone, and blasted Saran?) Of course, as Berman wanted to finish Kirk off, once and for all, he had to bring him out, as well...Speaking of Kirk's death scene...In the FIRST cut of the film, after a short but exhausting fight sequence (clearly showing Kirk as too old and out of shape for hand-to-hand combat), Saran pulls out a hidden blaster, and shoots him in the back...while the dying Captain stalls the villain long enough for Picard to save the day, the Enterprise's most famous Captain dies, in a most unheroic manner (perhaps an honest indication of how Berman felt about Kirk!).Berman had NO idea how popular Captain Kirk was, however, and the preview audience was so outraged by the sequence that Paramount, sensing a potential disaster, demanded the scene be rewritten and re-shot, a costly (as the film had already 'wrapped') but necessary move.The second version offered far more of the 'Classic' Captain Kirk that fans had come to expect, facing Saran fearlessly, duking it out, and proving himself far more of a match for the alien than Picard had been. He ends up 'saving the day', although there is a sense of irony that a man who'd spent most of his life on a 'bridge' would die when a bridge he's on collapses! While this ending was FAR superior to the first version, it still seemed an ignoble climax to a legend. Even William Shatner, after viewing it, considered killing Kirk a bad move, and offered a screenplay for a sequel where Kirk would be resurrected...which Berman, wanting NOTHING more to do with him, refused.So Kirk dies, his body covered with stones by Picard, and the 'Next Generation' crew is evacuated from yet another destroyed Enterprise. STAR TREK: GENERATIONS could have been a much better film, but in his haste to finish it, and move on, Rick Berman disappointed both series' fans. Fortunately, the greatest of the 'Next Generation' films, FIRST CONTACT, would soon be made.",Star Trek - Generations
76,crumpytv,Disappointing,5,12 November 2021,"I gave up after an hour.Just no real story line and there seem to be segments just edited together. We have seen it all before, nothing new.It was only worth watching with William Shatner on screen.",Star Trek - Generations
77,jhaggardjr,"Good but not great ""Star Trek"" adventure",7,16 September 2000,"""Star Trek: Generations"" marked the big screen debut of the cast from ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"". And the result is a good but not great adventure; their weakest so far. It's not real bad, but this film is overlong and runs a little slow at times. I just like their next two films in the series (""First Contact"" and ""Insurrection"") better. However I did find much to like about ""Generations"". The film begins with the christening of a new Enterprise ship. Old timers Kirk (William Shatner), Scotty (James Doohan), and Chekov (Walter Koenig) are the guests of honor at the event. The ship soon heads out into space and shortly thereafter into trouble. A solar ribbon called the Nexus nearly destroys the ship but the damage it does causes one major casualty. The film then zips ahead 78 years later to the current crew of the Starship Enterprise headed by Capt. Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart). Their introduced in a most awkward way (on a boat that looks like something from the past but has futuristic elements). Then they get up into their real ship (the U.S.S. Enterprise, of course), and discover that the same ribbon that appears at the beginning of the film (the Nexus) is about to pass by again. The villainous Dr. Soran (Malcolm McDowell), who was rescued from that earlier disaster, has a plan to destroy a star and get into the Nexus which is like being inside joy. This plot is kind of silly and it's made sillier by McDowell's performance. This is not one of the best villains in the series. But the special effects are very good, the music score is excellent, and there are many entertaining moments throughout. Stewart is good as Picard and would be even better in ""First Contact"" and ""Insurrection"". Jonathan Frakes (Riker), Brent Spiner (Data), LeVar Burton (LaForge), Michael Dorn (Worf), Gates McFadden (Crusher), and Marina Sirtis (Troi) all do an acceptable job in their first big screen outing (and, like Stewart, would get better in the next two films). ""Star Trek: Generations"" is a sci-fi/adventure that runs hot and cold but there's enough good things in it for me to recommend the film. A mild thumbs up.*** (out of four)",Star Trek - Generations
78,DavidSim240183,Nothing to write home about,5,19 July 2007,"I'm a huge Star Trek fan. Let me just get that out the way. And I've seen every episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation. But I'm not one of these obsessive Star Trek nerds who consider the series equal to the word of the Lord. No it has its flaws. And its had its share of bad episodes, just like any TV series.When TNG kicked off in 1987, it was a series that seemed a little unsure of itself. It wasn't quite hitting its stride. Some of the early episodes are downright awful. Even embarrassing when watched in the company of others. The first two seasons, roughly made up of about 45 episodes altogether has only a handful of really good stories. The rest are either mediocre or completely dire.But when Star Trek: The Next Generation moved into its third season (which is arguably the best of the series' seven year run), something quite remarkable happened. The series started to get good. One good thing you can say about the dry run of Seasons 1&2 was that it allowed the writers to identify the flaws plaguing the series. Such as killing off one of the main characters (in the first season no less!) and shifting another character into the same role who was more suited to it.It also dispensed with messagey stories and began to concentrate on harder science-fiction. The cast were clearly much more comfortable in their roles, they began to work as a team, and by the end of Season 3, TNG had really come into its own. This was a series that had come out of its rut and was now firing on all cylinders. TNG had found its voice, and never lost it.Barely had TNG ended in 1994 than the crew's first feature film was mandated. Star Trek: Generations is quite frankly a bit pointless. The problem I have with it is the fact that it gives the impression the original crew are passing the torch onto the Next Generation crew, to continue to boldly go where no one has gone before. Even though TNG has come to an end. Its a sentiment that has come far too late.And besides, Star Trek: Generations is a pretty stodgy story at best. The idea of the Nexus, a virtual wonderland that can give you your heart's desire is hardly thrilling. Not when you compare it to some of TNG's barnstorming two-parters, like The Best of Both Worlds, an epic story of Captain Picard's assimilation by the Borg. That was thrilling! Or the dizzying narrative structure of All Good Things, a fantastical journey between past, present and future. That's the type of story Generations wants to be but isn't.Its a shame that the TNG cast are placed in such an underwhelming story. Only a few of them get moments to shine. Patrick Stewart slides back into Captain Picard's chair with total ease. But the supporting cast are given criminally little to do. Out of them all, Brent Spiner's Data is given the biggest story arc.Fitted with an emotion chip, he gets to embody quite a range of feelings. Brent Spiner is a marvellous actor. Whenever he got to play multiple roles in TNG they were always a highlight. His performances in episodes like Masks and Brothers were nothing short of a tour-de-force. He's just as good as Peter Sellers or Alec Guinness. But I was a little disappointed that Data's emotional growth is reduced to hackneyed mush. The scene where he cracks inane jokes is cringeworthy. Only to be topped by an even sillier scene when he plays his control console like a musical instrument. An actor of Spiner's talents deserved better.In regards to the villain of the piece, Malcolm McDowell fits the bill quite nicely as Soran, a madman willing to commit genocide to enter the Nexus. Its a fairly basic part, but McDowell chews on the scenery with glee, and some of his lines of dialogue are even haunting:""They say time is the fire in which we burn!""Of course the one thing everyone wanted to see in Star Trek: Generations was to see if the rumours were true. If Captain Kirk was going to die in this film. And the answer is...yes!No one could ever accuse William Shatner of being a fantastic actor. Galaxy Quest did an exemplary job deconstructing Shatner's failings and egotism. And as he's moved into middle age, he's played into the role people expect of him. A gloryhound who hogs the spotlight all for himself. And its something he does with entertaining regard. And that's what he does here.He's only in the film for about half an hour, but its quite a memorable 30 minutes. He looks like he's having a whale of a time (maybe because he finally gets to kill off the role that type-casted him), and although his death scene is not all that moving, it is affecting in an understated way.Generations also looks a bit shabby on the big screen. It stays too closely to its TV origins. Its only in a few scenes that it opens up onto the big screen with pride. The destruction and crash-landing of the Enterprise-D is pretty astonishing, and so is the explosion of Veridian III. But elsewhere, its a film that's too stagebound for the big screen.Director David Carson directed some fine TNG episodes, in particular Yesterday's Enterprise and The Next Phase, but he looks quite lost on an A-list budget. Even Kirk and Soran's fistfight is clumsy. Its shot by somebody who clearly doesn't know anything about choreographing fight scenes.Star Trek: Generations is a lacklustre TNG maiden voyage. It has its moments here and there but it doesn't stay in the memory for long. You'd be a lot better off checking out the TNG two-parters I mentioned. Now they're entertainment!",Star Trek - Generations
79,SkullScreamerReturns,Change of captains,5,16 February 2020,"I was looking forward to watching this film because I liked the idea of seeing Kirk and Picard in the same movie. But I have to say that this is probably my least favorite of the (first seven) Star Trek movies I've seen so far. The story seemed a bit all over the place with too many characters but no one really standing out. The meeting of the captains also felt like a letdown because it was over too soon. I like The Next Generation series a lot but this film didn't feel as good - nor as good as the first movies with the original cast. So it's a bit ""leftovers of both worlds"".

And lets face it--Spock was supposedly still alive when ""STTNG"" occurred, so wouldn't he have liked to know his great friend was still alive?I know Nimoy did not take part in this movie, because he did not think the role was ""meaty"" enough and his absence was sorely felt.

Nothing else is really worth seeing. Kirk seems to be saying, ""Get me out of this franchise!"" with each passing line, while Captain Picard's constant attempts at pathos are nowhere near as convincing as they proved in the series and the other movies.Additionally, the naval holodeck scene at the beginning is nowhere near as funny as it was meant to be and the rest of the film is populated with new characters who are either dangerously gutless (the captain of the Enterprise-B) or disturbingly one-dimensional (Soran).

83,illbebackreviews,"Extremely poor dialogue, NOT redeemed in any way",3,22 April 2013,"To illustrate the horrible-ness of the film to the best, Star Trek: Generations is to the original crew films as to what Star Wars: The Phantom Menace is to the original Star Wars trilogy. Horrible! Whilst perhaps not as horrible as The Phantom Menace and the two horrid sequels that followed, Star Trek Generations gets plenty wrong for what is yet another perfect illustration of a horrible Star Trek film and perfectly justifies the statement that all Star Trek films with an odd number are poor, with the exception of The Search for Spock.Following the presumed death of Captain James T. Kirk, over 70 years later, The Enterprise has fallen into the hands of Captain Picard who deals with family strains whilst a new threat is under way. A surviver of an accident, that isn't carefully explained nor dealt with, has begun his attack on a star that when destroyed, will somehow give way to be able to visit the Nexus, which is a dream like world that presents the best and the happiest moments to anyone and everyone.The film suffers on almost every single aspect. The story is poor, but it goes even beyond this. It's not just a poor story and poor writing, but the story leaves no impact on us, as we have no idea who these new characters are. Much like how the original crew were first presented in Star Trek: The Motion Picture, the characters here are presented extremely ridiculously and annoyingly, the greatest of them being Data, who could have come off as an interesting android for the remainder of this franchise but is literally depicted as Jar Jar Binks. Now, it is clearly evident where George Lucas got his influence from. See, Spock was a fatherly figure and a wise man and was an interesting and likable character. Data is supposed to be a similar character but here is presented in the most horrid manner much like how we were apparently supposed to view Jar Jar as a Yoda type character. Such event is referred to as deliberately taking a sh*t on one's head! Data is annoying and is horrible jokes about an emotion chip and how he is suddenly able to understand jokes that were told years ago is not funny, its downright ridiculous. And not in a good way like in Monty Python and the Holy Grail. This character should've been presented far better and horrible writing is clearly evident here. Not only is Data poorly written, so is Picard who throughout the film deals with such family issues, having recently received the news that his family has died. Two things make this completely a forgettable and unnecessary sub plot to the film: This is the first time we even know who Picard is. There is obviously no reference in the original series due to the fact that this takes place over 70 years later. And secondly, the story about his family is hardly elaborated in anyway whatsoever and is instead, thrown in from the air and just left in a steady place. More poor writing is evident here. Each character is poorly written, to the fullest. The villain in the film, played by Malcolm McDowell, is yet again, another one of the many examples of poor writing in the film. His plan and his plot in the film is quickly summed up and almost never really referred to. Had he been written well, Soran could be a similar villain to Khan from the great 'Wrath of Khan'. Apparently in the film, Soran deals with personal issues of his own. MaybeThis character is hardly explained, due to horrible writing and has quite a silly and ridiculous plot. Whereas Star Trek 5 was ridiculous, it was not to this extent. The villain had a purpose that seemed more legit than here.Special effects are the same as all Star Trek films. Not great but decent enough for a pass. The acting is good, I would possibly say. Patrick Stewart as Picard is a great choice as is Malcolm McDowell as Soran but both are utterly wasted in this film. Returning is William Shatner, early on in the film as Captain James T. Kirk, in the best proportion of the film and returning late in the film in an extremely ridiculous concept.The best part of the film is the opening proportion as it cleverly resembles a good Star Trek film dealing with Kirk's desperation to get back into the captain's chair. Everything after this, is downhill ***SPOILERS*** The film suffers a lot in every way possible but here is when it is clearly evident that this is a truly horrible film. Our main character, James T Kirk, who has been loved by all is killed at the very end of the film in the most ridiculous and one of the most anticlimactic deaths to one of the great heroes. He dies and this scene shares no emotion like good Trek films do. When your main character, that you've loved so long, is killed and you laugh, that there is the perfect example of poor writing.***END OF SPOILERS*** Star Trek: Generations, is in my opinion, the second worst film of the franchise, winning the silver medal with a gold going to the first Star Trek film. This film pretty much ensures that all odd numbered Star Trek films are terrible, with one small exception. Badly written, with a lame story and undeveloped characters, due to poor writing, Star Trek Generations is an utter failure. To imagine this movie, it is the Phantom Menace of Star Trek. To illustrate, prior to the making of the film, the director realized it was the 7th instalment and that it had to be horrible, and so asked for some horrible writing and extremely poor character development This film is a complete failure in every aspect.",Star Trek - Generations

Paramount executives went a bit too fast to introduce Picard's crew into the big screen.Part of the Synopsis: 78 years after an event which took Captain Kirk's life, Captain Picard and his crew save a would-be scientist, which in fact is a madman who wants to enter a ""Nexus"" inside a deadly space ribbon. It is not his first experiment. He is backed up by an evil Klingon crew, headed by the Duras sisters, hungry for payback against the Enterprise.Though it was fun to see for once Data display emotions, thanks for Dr. Soong's microchip, the almost surrealistic meeting of Picard and Kirk deceives a bit: we would have loved to see both in a better setting than a back country landscape.I would not blame the actors here, but the storyline itself, a reminder of Star Trek V, which was too average: a madman looking for something apparently good, and the Enterprise crew must stop him.Sad that DeForest Kelley (health) and Leonard Nimoy (technicality) were absent for this movie.I would have renamed this movie: Star Trek Nexus.

85,daniewhite-1,Nexus time,4,17 December 2019,"Generations seems like it shouldn't have been made immediately after the successful conclusion of The Next Generation TV series because it feels like, for the entirety of its stay, it is becalmed in the character completion of that shows ending run. Little or no momentum and impetus is left to propel these characters, in this situation, or any likely scenario, with any drama or thrill.Sadly a script and story treatment that should have been discarded was adapted for this film. Safe and steady production decisions seem to have been made throughout and this trend continued all the way through the creative process too.With all, ALL, the lose ends that the TV series had left behind it: and these were legion because of the episodic nature of the TV show; how could they not have found a jumping off point from one of the better episodes???!!Discounting what the producers might have done, and focussing sadly on what was done, this is a rightfully semi forgotten and highly forgettable adventure-sci-fi-star trek-action film!Really Star Trek struggles in almost all of its efforts to translate small screen to big screen and Generations is a case in point for this pattern.I think that the only dramatically valid way to structure a TNG film at this stage would have been a divorce feature....where the Crew, as in the cast, (bad joke) are separated by career progressions and promotions and through a sequence of events are reunited. Probably because the threat emanates from one of their prior TV episodes as suggested earlier. That was surely the way to get these characters translated from small to large screen! Not a safe and seriously starched old crew/new crew angle.What we have is de fecto time travel story yet again from star trek.....if a writer is in doubt then star trek can always handle another time travel device. Something like that must be the main line of advice for commissioned writers.This time it's the nexus apparently. There's always room for one more 'arrow of time' cheat on star trek.That sums up the level of creative bankruptcy where it's easy to believe that business decisions demanded a film and so a film, any film, was conjured up to order.In its own way the film contains accessible performances from the actors; ugly set design and overall production design work and repetitive special effects work mar the work that the actors are doing.I give a 4/10 because there is a little bit more value from the nexus effect blowing up ships in the opening scene and some of the hits that the Enterprise-D takes seem heavy and clunky smashes in the final space fight. Plus Patrick Stewart and Malcolm McDowell are good acting/reacting off of each other. But this is faint praise really.",Star Trek - Generations

Then it flashes into the future and in the films best scene we see Worf being promoted to Lieutenant Commander, in a long overdue move up in rank which was delayed by Worf's slaying of Duras a few years before this.(Trivia fans) Then, we get to see an already seen in Kirk's time, Doctor Soran dementedly going on about having to get to the Nexus. The film is so so disorganized that it is sometimes hard to keep track of. Data decides to install his emotion chip. For some reason he ends up with it in the top of his head. In 'Brothers', an earlier episode of Next Gen, the chip was inserted into Lore's neck?? Anyway, Data sets off laughing at almost anything, in a stupidly written script for him.

88,David_Frames,Basically it's Trainspotting in space,6,9 June 2005,"The first and only Star Trek film to deal with the difficult subject of substance abuse - specifically heroin addiction. Before you start, look at this titanic body of fact and take off those rose tinted glasses. The film is essentially about attempting to find a permanent escape from deep rooted unhappiness. Dr.Soran is attempting to find a refuge from the trauma of loosing his family, Picard is also in mourning having heard that the family he vehemently disliked and saw about once every 20 years has burnt to death and Kirk - poor, sweet, rotund Kirk has lost his ship, his career and his purpose. All three find solace in the Nexus, an enormous metaphor plundering its way across space, destroying those who try and use it without understanding its nature. Soran's angst in the opening sequence is at having been briefly 'touched' by the nexus and he goes through an 80 year withdrawal, instantly addicted to its pleasure inducing side-effects. If you were left in any doubt that this was a film about drugs and hard ones at that then recall the scene in which Guinan describes the stream as being like 'wrapping yourself inside pure joy, as if joy were something tangible and you could wrap yourself up in it like a blanket'. Add an expletive and you could be quoting from an Irvine Welsh novel. Data is indirectly linked with the nexus but experiences a drug of his own in the form of his emotion chip, a device that inserted into his body produces random and uncontrolled emotions ranging from joy to anger to extreme fear. Sound familiar? Christ, I half expected the Happy Mondays to walk in at some point. Of course all the stuff about exploding suns, Klingons and time travel is a mere distraction - the fact is that when you peel back the layers you're looking at a movie in which an insane scientist is prepared to kill for a new hit, the Enterprise captains nearly succumb but endure the worst kind of cold turkey that causes their ship and their life to be destroyed respectively and the cat survives, presumably just long enough to give Data Toxal Plasmosis when he finally short circuits and conks out on the floor of his quarters. A scene that I imagine for cut to secure a child friendly rating.You want to talk technicalities? Fine. Star Trek: Generations is a ever so slightly turgid instalment for this fine franchise. Its primary difficulty, aside from the controversial subject matter, is the fact that it suffers from very poor pacing and an excess of very slow scenes. I imagine this may be to do with the inexperience in making a movie by those behind the camera. David Carson directed many 1st rate episodes of the television series but in adapting to a movie schedule and the greater time this allowed for perfecting each scene, he seems to have followed the logic of slowing everything down - more methodical acting please, more pause for effect, everybody just take-your-time. No problem there except that this paradoxically makes the movie feel like a t.v episode and one inferior to the best the show had to offer. Its not framed particularly cinematic ally either, though credit must go to John A. Alonzo's excellent cinematography which certainly makes the whole thing look polished at the very least. It isn't much of a cross over either as its really a Next Generation movie with a little bit of the classic cast. It might have been better just to make it a purely 2nd generation affair and hopefully one that didn't include some of the T.V show weakest villains, namely the Duras sisters. I mean, c'mon, surely anyone would have been better - Denise Crosby's Romulan commander for example. Were I a cynic and I assure you I'm not...not really, then I'd say that the overused Klingons were only there to allow for the re-use of footage from the previous film, i.e. the destruction of the bird of prey and save a few quid. Surely Paramount didn't have to be so thrift, this was one of their major cash cows for God's sake. When they did give ILM a bit of money, presumably pried for an execs cold dead hand, then the effects house turn in some sterling work but scenes on old galley ships, 20th century looking living rooms and old Idaho wood cabins smack of cheapness and have no place in a big-budget sci-fi would be blockbuster. My advice? In future keep it purely space bound. Not very good then but peppered with some decent moments - though not up to the standard seen in the show's heyday, oh and a terrible and all too casual waste of the Enterprise we lovingly grew up with plus the poorly handled, throwaway death of a cultural icon makes for two colossal celluloid mistakes. Unforgivable! Now pass me that syringe would you please?",Star Trek - Generations
89,moviedude1,One of the few film subjects where it's hard to be unbiased...,9,9 February 2009,"""Generations"" follows what appears to be the end of Capt. James T. Kirk, only to find him still alive about eighty years later, where Capt. Jean-Luc Picard finds him existing in an anomaly in space and attempts to convince him to leave this protective haven to help stop a madman whose own attempts to join with this anomaly have included blowing up stars and suns to influence it's travel through space.It's hard for me to give an unbiased comment on this film, due, not so much, to my familiarity of the series, but, rather, because I'm such a fan of Capt. Kirk, his time, and the Star Trek series, as a whole. Some comments include some knowledge of what they know about this film and I find myself wanting to do the same: In the first scene of what was, then, the latest starship to be called Enterprise, where Kirk, Scotty, and Chekov were on hand to send her off on her maiden voyage. Director David Carson had a ""dry run"" of the scene with the extras, was happy with what he saw, then brought in the film's stars and shot the scene. When the stars left after filming the shot, he went off on the extras for totally blowing the scene, where one of the extras remarked something about ""being hard to focus when you're on the bridge of the Enterprise with Captain Kirk."" I will say that this is one of my favorite in the series of films because we find out what actually happened to Capt. Kirk after all the years of ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" and brief mentions of him and his time throughout the syndicated series. I think that this film is, perhaps, only topped out on my list of favorites in the film series by ""Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home."" 9 out of 10 stars.",Star Trek - Generations
90,Gunn,Could have been so much better!,8,30 September 2009,"This entry in the Star Trek Movie franchise is sometimes terrific and sometimes over the top. It begins nicely with the original Trek gang of Kirk, Scotty and Chekhov inspecting a newer version of the Starship Enterprise. Things are interrupted by the villainous Soran (Malcolm McDowell) who is searching for the new element tri-lithium in order to make his way home to Nexus and he'll stop at nothing to complete his mission. An explosion occurs on the Enterprise and Kirk and Soran are missing and presumed dead. The film's first weak spot is the introduction of the ""Next Generation"" crew, who replaced the original gang. They are shown on the Holodeck cruising aboard a vintage sailing vessel ""The Enterprise"" dressed as a Horatio Hornblower-like crew. People start falling into the ocean and it's a really silly outing. This episode is interrupted by a storyline involving the death of Captain Picard's (Patrick Stewart) brother and nephew and then the insertion of an ""emotion chip"" which causes Data (Brent Spiner) to overact like an idiot. Spiner plays the part of a robot better than he does a human. I'm not sure if it's him or the director (David Carson), but it was way over the top. Once we get back to the main plot line of pursuit of the villain Soran the film gets back on course. The Data character in this movie made me cringe! This film was meant to create the transition of the original crew's Trek films over to the ""Next Generation"" gang. At times it does the reverse, making one pine for the old gang, but eventually we bond with the new crew. I will say that the Klingon scenes and the scenes on the space station are good, as are the Nexus scenes. The rest of the Next Gen crew are fine, Troi (Marina Sirtis), Worf (Michael Dorn), Riker (Jonathan Frakes), Geordie (Levar Burton) and the always dependable Picard (Stewart) and Guinan (Whoopi Goldberg). Effects and visuals are excellent as is the music score by Dennis McCarthy and McDowell makes a superb villain as usual. A few tweaks and this could have been so much better.",Star Trek - Generations
91,Hang_All_Drunkdrivers,Confusing silly scifi flik,4,24 December 2004,"THe nexus is described by whoopi goldberg as a place of PURE JOY. Makes you wonder how they're gonna portray that on screen. Well... Captain Picard gets tossed in there and it turns out to be a wife and six kids! Capt Kirk is sent there and for him it's a well-furnished kitchen and a riding horse!! The evil soren was there once and now wants to get back and is willing to blow up a star and kill millions to get there. SPOILER. Picard and Kirk must stop him and of course they do and kirk gets killed in the process and that's pretty much the story.Picard is pretty good but shatner is old and looks fat and as others have commented, his death was very unglorious for such a great character as kirk. The spock character was replaced by a twit called data, an android with an emotion chip implanted. He was awful. Spock had tremendous dignity and ability and you had to admire him, but data is just a doofus.About 15 minutes of the movie is devoted to picard and crew playing sailors on an old naval vessel from around 1750. What that had to do with anything is beyond me.",Star Trek - Generations
92,BrickNash,"A horrible, trashy and disrespectful mess of a film!",5,31 July 2011,"Star Trek: Generations promised everything and delivered absolutely nothing. Marketed as the meeting point between TOS and TNG it should have been a rip-roaring space epic with classic characters aplenty.Unfortunately the reality is far from that vision. ST: Generation is absolutely nothing more than an extended episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation, and not really a great one at that. The whole thing feels like a television production from it's cheap look to it's awful storyline.Trekkies are usually quite smart when it comes to science and engineering and can spot a plot hole or a physics mistake at a glance. TNG built it's reputation by including much more accurate tech talk which was praised by scientists, however the plot here is absolutely absurd, and so many things just stick out as ""that wouldn't work!"" I know that some suspension of disbelief is required with stuff like this, but a rocket which is visibly travelling at a not very fast speed, cannot reach a solar system's sun within a few seconds.Add to this that half the cast of TNG only have a few lines in the film and you can start to see how it is unbalanced character wise. Malcolm McDowell as Soron is about as TV episode bad guy as you can get. Even though he did command a rather sinister performance his physicality just wasn't there to make him stand out and is easily forgotten amongst the bland script.The biggest blow however, must come from the absolute waste of William Shatner in this film, and the horribly tacky manner of the death of such an Iconic character. Shatner is on screen for barely 20 minutes and his death in some remote cheap looking hilltop somewhere in a desert is just insulting.Undoubtedly the best part of the film was at the start where we see Kirk take command of the new Enterprise during a crisis, again a horrible waste of James Doohan and Walter Koenig.There are one or two good moments here and there, but it just feels far too much like the TV show to hold any sort of weight as a film.In conclusion, the movie is nothing more than a great idea with a terrible story and sloppy execution. Had this film been made a couple of years earlier with a better plot and could have included Leonard Nimoy and the Wonderful DeForest Kelly before his decline in health, and had equal screen time for the characters then it could have been a winner. As it stands, it is a two hour advert for Rick Bermans Star Trek franchise that shamelessly exploits classic characters to excite interest and does not deliver.We'd have to wait until First Contact to get a really decent Next Generation movie, but by then it was too late.",Star Trek - Generations
93,Starbuck-13,They should have decided for ONE Generation...,6,5 May 1999,"This movie is certainly not bad, but far from the quality of the good Star Trek movies (II-IV and VI). It has too many too boring passages (especially in the Nexus, oh my, those sequences seem to last forever). Kirks dying words seem to be out of character. And the fate of the Enterprise seemed more than pointless to me.On the other hand, there are some good points, like Data's humor. He has the best lines of the movie. And then my favorite quote by Dr. Soran: ""Time is a fire in which we burn"". Wow, this is extremely well said.All in all, an average Science Fiction film.",Star Trek - Generations
94,bgaiv,"Very good, some misfires",9,13 September 2020,"The weakness for me is the opening Enterprise B scenes. The cameramen lights are just obviously silly. But the main problem is Captain Cameron is made to look stupid just to make Kirk look heroic and decisive. That's an old overused trope, used in original Trek itself, but it's cheap.A bright spot for me of Star Trek 2009, is that Captain Pike is shown to be actually smart and capable - even if his obsession with Kirk is a bit unexplained.Anyway, in Generations, Kirk's demise may not have been the greatest possible, but it was ok.Another bit in Generations I liked was how Sauren used his El-Alaurian ""listener"" powers to read Picard's mind to turn manipulate him... or did he? ""Time is the fire in which we burn."" A smart listener/manipulator human could do what Sauren does here. And there's no sound effect played out overwrought explanation that Trek tends to do. Very nicely underplayed for Trek to the degree it is almost an Easter egg.",Star Trek - Generations
95,boyinflares,"Solid, but disappointing",7,6 November 2005,"The one problem we have with the Next Generation films (all four of them) is that someone high up in the film-making process seems to forget that the Next Generation began as a television series about equals, as opposed to the Original Series having 3 stars and a lot of supporting characters. I understand that Picard and Data are seen as the most popular characters in the Next Generation that appeal to the general public, but the story lines that get played out for the two of them in the movies (family and finding humanity) have already been done in the series.Those two themes - Picard's family and Data's quest for humanity - are central parts of this film, and take up a lot of the time, but the other characters do get their moments, and being the gracious professionals that they are, Frakes, Sirtis, McFadden, Burton and Dorn all give fabulous performances. Whoopi Goldberg appears unbilled as Guinan, and Patti Yasutaki also appears as Nurse Ogawa.""Generations"" also features three members of the Original Trekers, Captain Kirk, Scotty and Chekov, the latter two in small roles, while Kirk has a much larger role, yet his scenes, alongside Picard, are the slowest and most boring part of the film, even if they are confronting the enemy together.One of the enemies in ""Generations"" is a mad man, well played by Malcolm McDowell, the others are the two Klingon sisters who appeared towards the end of the Next Generation series, and make welcome appearances once more. Also watch for Jacqueline Kim as the daughter of Sulu from the Original Series.This is a decent film, but like all Next Generation films, can be quite repetitive and leaves some of the cast (particularly the lovely McFadden) with little to do.",Star Trek - Generations
96,Svenstadt,"Promising beginning, but quickly devolves in plot.",6,30 December 2019,"This film is visually appealing, with a very good score, as is typical for The Next Generation series. However, as is also typical of these stories, the plot loses cohesion and the story falls apart.
The beginning, with the original crew, is also a good part, as is the tie-in. I like that the film keeps you gripped into the story. However, the subject matter, which involves an energy ribbon in space, where a person can be there and yet not there at the same time, makes no sense to me at all! If these people are supposedly locked into a fantasy world, then how could they go back in time and stop Dr. Soren (Malcolm McDowell), a mad scientist who, back in the days of Kirk, had an accidental encounter with this gateway to paradise, and has spent all his energy ever since then devising a way to get himself back in. His plan, however, involves using his scientific know-how, to destroy entire solar systems, and with them the populations inhabiting them, to get this energy ribbon to move towards him.
There is a sub-plot involving Lursa and B'Etor, the Klingon sisters. This part makes no sense to me as someone who has followed the series. We saw on TNG the series that the shields are the main defense of the ship. Once the shields are down, a single photon torpedo can destroy a ship (and it usually does). Those weapons are theoretically more powerful than all the A-bombs ever made on Earth, and launched at warp speeds. Yet, during the battle scene, these weapons are no more destructive than cannonballs!! The Enterprise would have been dead in the water. But they made this scene for dramatic effect.
The sub-plots involving Data are typically distracting. This movie was better than any of the original six TOS crew films. But it could have been a little better. For some strange reason, it manages to entertain. The cast was all top-notch, with many cameos.",Star Trek - Generations
97,Lupercali,"Ok, but could have been better",6,9 September 2002,"***SLIGHT SPOILERS*** What IS it with Star Trek movies? Almost without exception they start off promisingly, and then somehow, somewhere, the wheels fall off them.* spoilers ahead*It's ironic that  Kirk had to bow out and make way for the 'younger' Picard, since Picard looks older than Kirk anyway (he's not, of course. At least, Patrick Stewart really is 9 years younger than William Shatner), but I suppose some of the rest of the TOC were looking conspicuously long in the tooth.Anyway things start out well. I've always preferred Picard to Kirk as a captain, even if some of the other major cast members aren't as strong as the original cast. Nevertheless everything looks promising: a nice balance of action, drama, comedy, special effects, and not too many gaping plot holes (at least compared with the ludicrous ST V) - but somehow it just runs out of steam.Why?  I'm not entirely sure, but somehow Malcolm McDowell's character was just silly, and when my memories of this film return to its worst moments, I usually think about him and his silly bloody rocket, and Kirk and Picard arsing about trying to stop him lettingit off.Generations isn't a bad Star Trek entry. It's about as good as ST VI, and ought to demonstrate that not _all_ the odd numbered movies are poor, but again, I'm left thinking, why make a movie of this stuff? Take one of the better two-part Next Generation episodes and you've got better SF fare. It seems to me that for some reason the gaping holes in logic that seem endemic to the movies appear less frequently in the TV series. Are the movies dumbed down for a wider audience?For example, in this movie, we have The Nexus - a ribbon of space/time or somesuch thing which wanders around the galaxy, and if you get caught up in it, you exist in a state of absolute bliss, where all your fondest fantasies are realised.Why?I mean, what possible reason could a celestial phenomenon have for doing this to people?Another thing that had me scratching my head. Guinan (and sometimes I wish someone would wipe that stupid enigmatic half-smile off her face by just kicking her in the shins or something) tells Picard she can't help him stop Dr Doom or whatever McDowell's character is called - but there's someone who can: Kirk.  Ok, why does Picard think he needs Guinan's help to physically stop McDowell from launching the rocket, lwet alone Kirk's help? As it turns out, as events unfold, he couldn't possibly have known this except in hindsight. Certainly the chances of two people succeeding are probably better than one person alone, but as a premise for getting Picard and Kirk in the same scenes, this is pretty lame.Oh, and in the Star Trek V Kirk says he's always known that he'll die alone. Guess what - he doesn't. That's not really a logical error of course, but in the code of these films, when someone comes out with a pronouncement like that, you're really supposed to take it as fact.  Of course, it's a bit dubious as to where Kirk actually dies. I suppose they might get out of it that way.One more beef: Data's emotion chip. He puts it in, and straight away starts acting like a total nutter - this in the middle of a really critical and perilous situation. Geordie is saying ""Data, are you alright?"", or rolling his eyes, when in fact he should have de-activated him and reefed the stupid thing out, which is what he promised to do at the first sign of any trouble anyway.  In fact the emotion chip thing is a real shame. It could and should have been a powerful element of the film, but instead it was frittered away as a device to allow Data to provide the comic relief for the movie - a real waste of Brent Spiner's considerable talents, IMO.So after all that griping, why am I giving it 6 out of 10?  Because, despite all those problems, it's still quite watchable, even if I'll be watching old episodes of next gen before I re-watch this.",Star Trek - Generations

100,vonnoosh,What a mistake,4,2 May 2020,"This movie was meant to bridge a gap that never needed to be bridged., the original series and next generstion of Star Trek. Star Trek VI was an excellent send off for the original cast and I think they all knew it.Scotty comes back saying lines meant for Spock, Chekhov comes back saying lines meant for McCoy (even acting like a doctor at times) and William Shatner doesn't play Kirk as much as he plays William Shatner playing Kirk. He doesn't come across in character.The character of Kirk is mostly lost without the supporting cast anyway. Picard doesnt have that problem. That makes this movie feel like it would have worked alot better as just a Next Generation movie and maybe the 2nd best of the four made thanks to the strength of Malcolm McDowell's performance as fanatical villain, Soran.The movie does have its interesting moments for Next Generstion fans. We learn something more abput Picard life. A gripe I always had was how the relationships built over time on the tv series were entirely abandoned for the films. Its like they never occurred at all. The one relationship that developed and carried over was Data with his cat.Some complain about plotholes they think are there but I do not see them. Soran's sun killing missile could of only detonated with that destructive force if it was launched instead of blown up. Geordie being tortured could've been just a diversion so he wouldn't be aware of what was being done to his visor when he is returned. The Klingons in an old ship doing what they do is kind of stupid and cheap. Plenty of newer villains for the Next Generation to tangle with.A plothole that does bother me is why do Kirk and Picard go back to Veridian III from the Nexus JUST before the missile is launched if they have the power to choose when to return and if they see their chances of success dwindling, why not let the ribbon take them back to the Nexus and just start over? That was some cheap writing for what was supposed to be such a dramatic moment.Thanks to this site, I now know Roddenberry never wanted to bring the casts together and I think he was 100% right about that.",Star Trek - Generations

The pictures I've come across with just the two of them together I gold latinum hold onto.Generations is in my top five scripts their friendship plays a huge part in the storyline. They steal it--especially Data of course. Those who hate the chip, I say couldn't imagine the film would be without it. His silliness isn't non-stop; there's moments that I get close to lump rise, hold back crying or purring as it were. ""Spot....""That said, other than a couple parts, after he's abducted Geordi's participation is sadly predictably lame. Now it's Klingons got him. Why couldn't Riker been the one captured and Geordi run the ship into the ground (hee)? After his helping evacuate people, he fades out. What-in-the-world?? That said my number #1 bone to pick with Next Generation, over the course of 7 seasons & 4 movies, little to no development for Geordi LaForge. Best scene all 4 movies just him, in Insurrection watching the scenery--a second before he begins talking to Picard. Couldn't he done a soliloquy? Once more these two outdistances my liking Generations' other plots. By the way, couldn't found someone else to die close to Picard than the nephew??

102,BB-15,A Sci-fi Buffet,7,4 December 1999,"Is time our enemy or a companion? That conflict is at the core of Star Trek Generations. The first twist on this idea is when we see Captain Kirk and two of the original Enterprise crew. There is a sense of being cast aside, that time has been unfair to them. Captain Picard also feels the sting of time's passing. With the death of his nephew, he painfully realizes that he is the last of his family and that he does not have time to have children. A character named Soran believes that time is something to be subdued, conquered. And Generations provides a way to do it in a place called the Nexus. Soran will kill millions to get his way, to find this Nexus.
This all plays out cleverly, intertwined with humor and subplots such as Commander Data, an android, who desires to be more human, two Klingons who want to get even with Star Fleet and an exciting crash landing by the Enterprise. The special effects involving exploding stars are quite beautiful. Patrick Stewart does a nice job as Picard. I especially liked the range of emotions and problems that his character experiences. It is not the typical macho role. There is also good support from Brent Spiner, Malcolm McDowell and Whoopie Goldberg. The only big drawback is William Shatner. He has some nice quiet moments but somehow he still thinks he is an action star. Considering his weight and age such heroics haven't made sense for him since Star Trek 3, in 1984. Time has taken its toll.

103,TheSeaLion,"The worst ""Star Trek"" movie",3,23 April 2014,"A lot of the time, fan-fiction for a franchise is so ludicrous and more focused on what the fan wants to see than what would work for the story. In the case of ""Star Trek: Generations"", the same can be said, only this time it's the creators of the film who have the ludicrous ideas that focus more on what they want or what they think fans want than what would work out well. This film is probably what a lot of Trekkies have dreamed of. The movie or TV episode where James T. Kirk (William Shatner) from the original series and Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) from ""TNG"" would team up to stop a villain. The film focuses more on the basic premise that these two legendary star ship captains must work together than making a movie with a good story that would have worked to have the crew of ""TNG"" series solely in it. Starting off at some point in between ""The Undiscovered Country"" and ""TNG"", Kirk and a few remaining members of his crew are welcomed as guests for the maiden voyage of the Enterprise-B. During its voyage, the star ship receives an distress signal and investigates it, discovering a ship that is about to be destroyed by an energy ribbon and beams the survivors aboard, including a man who wants to enter the energy ribbon, Dr. Soran (Malcolm McDowell). The Enterprise gets caught in the ribbon and in a successful effort to save the ship, Captain Kirk is feared dead.Cut to 78 years later on board the Enterprise-D, under the command of Picard. On board, the android Data (Brent Spiner) has an emotions chip implanted into him so he can feel more human while Captain Picard learns that his family has recently perished in a fire. The crew runs into Dr. Soran who is planning on entering the energy ribbon to a place called the Nexus, which is described as a place of joy. Picard attempts to stop him, but he is unable to and both Soran and Picard are swallowed by the Nexus. In the Nexus, Picard discovers Kirk and the two form up to go back to stop Soran, as there is no sense of time in the Nexus, and stop him from changing the Nexus' course to enter it because by doing so, it will destroy a planet.The subplot involving Data learning to adjust to the emotions chip is not particularly interesting and is used not so much to develop Data as a character, but more for him to be a source of comic relief by doing a number of things that make us laugh at the movie, not with the movie. Ironically, the only time I laughed at anything Data did in this film was the one time I was told it was not funny, which was when he pushed Dr. Crusher (Gates McFadden) into the water on the holodeck after a misunderstanding.Fortunately, the fan-fiction part is only the last twenty minutes or so, and the combination of Kirk and Picard isn't all that bad, the mission and their plan makes no sense. After meeting up in the Nexus, they go back to right before Soran changes the ribbon's course so they have a race against the clock. Next, they act as though they have one chance when in actuality, they could keep entering the Nexus and coming out to try again until they got it right. Next, Picard could have gone back to the day he rescued Soran and prevented him from going through with his mission while Kirk went back to his time via the Nexus. When there are three much more probable options that could have been used but were not for the sake of seeing Picard and Kirk work together to stop a bad guy, it's not only insulting to the audience's intelligence, it is insulting to the characters of Picard and Kirk intelligence because in the past, they have been shown to to come up with better plans in less time than they had.""Star Trek: Generations"" is easily the worst film out of all twelve ""Star Trek"" films. While ""The Final Frontier"" and ""Insurrection"" were bad, they were at least more thought out and had a more coherent plot to it that did not rely on what feels like fan-fiction.",Star Trek - Generations
104,winstonsmith_84,Would have given it an 8/10 if not for one thing...,7,20 May 2021,"Having not seen this film for many years, I watched it again. I enjoyed it much more this time than when I first saw it. But the reasons I think I didn't like it as much the first time stuck with me and I'll get to that. But firstly, I must say this is true Trek. Exploring the emotions of characters, the science fiction phenomenon, the alien action, the philosophical questions between living in reality versus fantasy... it all comes together in great fashion. But what rubbed me the wrong way enough to bring a good movie down to a 7? Read on...... It's the classic ""kill off your hero"" thing. Destroy the Enterprise. Kill off Kirk. I don't know why every tale needs to end with us seeing our heroes die. Or the things we love being put to rest. Can't we have the cowboy ride off into the sunset anymore?It happened in Star Wars, one by one they killed off my heroes, Han Solo, Luke, and Leia. I know I know it's a different franchise but I bring it up here because I believe it's a cheap gimmick used by films to try to force us to feel emotional. But I've always seen through this. Films should bring about emotion in us, however, I don't like how it's the ""thing to do"" to kill off our beloved characters. Even in sacrifice. It's just cheap. No matter how you kill off Kirk, I guess I just can't be satisfied.Anyways, other than that the film was pretty good.",Star Trek - Generations
105,scott-sw,"Not great, but not awful, either.",6,24 December 2007,"Star Trek Generations gets a mixed review from me. Just like the debut of the original cast in Star Trek the Motion Picture, Generations stumbles out of the starting great--although not as bad as the former. We begin with the original cast members, Scotty, Chekov and Kirk seeing the new Enterprise released from space dock under a green captain and crew. While out, they receive a distress signal from a ship caught in a strange energy field. Called the Nexus, we find a young Guinan (Whoopie Goldberg) and a madman know as Sauran. Kirk is killed in action. Spring board about 80 years into the future and we find the Next Generation cast on standard exploration. They find Sauran many years later and discover a fiendish plot. Instead of trying to get to the Nexus, he wants to bring the Nexus to him on a planet. In order to do that, he needs to destroy a few planets that could affect some heavy populated areas. Picard must stop him. However, he fails, finding himself in the Nexus. He finds the famed Kirk in the Nexus from 80 years prior. Unfortunately, the Admiral is enjoying the addictive fantasy the Nexus provides. Can Picard persuade him to follow? Meanwhile, the Enterprise D must make an emergency landing on the planet below. While I liked some aspects of the movie, I found that it was very much like early Next Generation Episodes that was built up for an hour-and-a-half, and resolved in fifteen minutes. While the first third of the movie starts fine, it dissolves by the end of the first act, perhaps sooner. The story tries to be philosophical and introspective amidst some good action, but fails miserably. This is apparent with Picard's views on the issue that seemed like a badly-written forced speech instead of finding itself in subtle and believable dialog. Finally, except for Data, the Next Generation Crew seemed like props to push buttons and keep the Enterprise D in working action. And while Brent Spiner got to elaborate on Data's new found emotions, his uncontrollable laughter got annoying. Kirk's resolution was too quick and did not let him go out in a true blaze of glory. Of course, there were some good things about it. There was closure for Kirk and the Enterprise D. The Enterprise D and it's emergency landing made a much better action sequence that was far better and more intriguing. Also, Generations gives us a bridge for the old guard and the new guard. Seeing Picard and Kirk work and fight together is enjoyable. For the most part, this eliminates the uneasy competition between the original and the next generation, creating a cooperative synergy. This it not to say the picture is perfect or dynamic, because I still have my hesitations on a full recommendation.",Star Trek - Generations
106,CinefanR,Picard should sue filmmakers for slander,1,27 July 2012,"This abysmal TNG movie turned Picard into a confused crying old man, destroyed his family for no reason and transformed Data into a raving idiot. How is that possible? Picard has always been an explorer, not a common family man. He knew what he wanted to be, embraced his vocation and made his decision fully knowing what to expect from then on. No regrets. The Captain was never comfortable around children and the last thing he craved for was a housewife and a bunch of kids. He was meant to discover new worlds and travel the the galaxies, not to baby-sit and enjoy domestic life. Of course, Picard had his emotional moments throughout the series, but those moments were always perfectly justified, consistent with his character and carefully planned. The idiots who made this movie have they no common sense? No understanding of these characters? No respect for the fans? It's like they did it in spite of the Trekkers, in spite of everything Star Trek TNG stands for.I can't even remember anything else from this movie, that's how awful it was. They shouldn't be allowed to trash the franchise like that, yet they did it over and over again with every single opportunity. It's a crying shame, that's what.",Star Trek - Generations

Even after 25 years the movie looks great! I saw this movie about 100 times on VHS when I was a kid, i think the next gen crew had more to offer than the original star trek cast, i think it's because we got 7 full seasons of next gen and A LOT of character development, so we now the cast through and through.

111,brent_or,Commendably Thoughtful / Viciously Boring / Superfluous,6,18 May 2013,"I tend to agree with those who are of the opinion that the Original Series Star Trek crew did not need to appear in this film. They had already had their send off, and a very fine one at that, in The Undiscovered Country. There was no need for their presence to be stretched out into Generations. That applies to Kirk more than to anyone else, of course. But here, he gets to take his final bow, of sorts. It could have been done better.At the same time, it could be argued that the Next Generation crew did not need to be in this film, either. It doesn't really do much to meaningfully develop them beyond what had already been done in their seven seasons on television. The subsequent film, First Contact, probably should have served as the lone Next Generation big screen-adventure.In any event, Generations is not a horrible film, but in practice it is a bit of a drag to watch, like one of those books that are hard to read without falling asleep. Some will argue that it is superfluous, and most would probably agree that it is exceedingly slow and frankly boring in spite of its decent screenplay and somewhat fresh plot.Speaking of which, the overall story (beyond the obvious 'Kirk meets Piccard, passes baton' gimmick) looks fairly cool on paper. A ribbon of energy writhing through space, which happens to be a portal to a hallucinogenic other-dimension called the Nexus, where time has no meaning? All right. Malcolm McDowell's Dr. Soren, a member of a long-lived species who has been trying to get back into the Nexus for decades, who collaborates with rogue Klingons, and who is willing to destroy an entire populated planet in the service of his obsession? Sure. A sequence in which the USS Enterprise-D suffers a warp-core breach, forcing the crew to evacuate to the saucer section, which then crashes into the forests of the planet below? Why not – that sounds exciting. Nothing like blowing up the Enterprise to create a spectacle.As mentioned before, however, it all unfolds at an excessively leisurely pace that challenges the attention span of all but the most dedicated of viewers, and neither Enterprise crew (the 'B' crew at the beginning, featuring the old guys, or the 'D' Next Generation crew) really gets much out of it in terms of character development. I do however have to note Jacqueline Kim's brief but excellent performance as Ensign Demora Sulu, i.e. Hikaru Sulu's grown-up daughter. She looks like a terrific captain in the making as she holds the helm in the opening sequence, and frankly I would rather watch a film about her than what the rest of Generations turns out to be.Two specific things dog all of the Next Generation-era films, and they both rear their heads here. The first and arguably the most annoying is the overestimation of Data's fascination quotient. Every single one of the four Next Generation films feels compelled to put significant focus on his character, and with the exception of First Contact, it all feels gratuitous to me. Yes, his search for humanity is interesting. But not this interesting, and his adventures in humor here are more obnoxious than charming (or actually funny). Instead of fixating on Data, I wish that a more involved role would have been written for Dr. Crusher, who I feel to have been neglected more than any other major crew member.The other issue is the hard truth that the Next Generation's tone and aesthetic sensibilities, while well-suited for television, are simply not big-screen cinematic, particularly in comparison to the Original Series elements with which they share screen time in Generations. The uniforms especially could have benefited from a more sophisticated re-design. The common criticism that Next Generation films are more like glorified television episodes is not entirely unwarranted, although to be fair, Generations does have some very nice sequences.Is this the worst Star Trek film? Goodness, no. It might not even be the worst Next Generation-era film, when you consider the respective issues present in Insurrection and Nemesis. If being boring is a crime, then both Insurrection and The Motion Picture have no doubt shared a cell with Generations. Ultimately, this is a decent film, but probably only of much interest to Star Trek enthusiasts, and even then more as a curiosity than anything else.",Star Trek - Generations

However, execs at Paramount felt it too long and too effects laden to make for television.The opening 20 minutes could have been so much better, maybe if they left the deleted scenes intact. The TNG part of it made for a cool two part episode, but then came the ending.With a scene deemed too graphic a death by test audiences, Shatner was dropped off a bridge and pronounced dead. Yeah, guys saves the Universe a few times over... meets big wussy death.So many places to have gone, so few actual writing ideas at Paramount.

113,TimBoHannon,A New Era Begins,6,13 September 2007,"""Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home"" was received so well in 1986 that Star Trek underwent a rebirth. ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" began airing the next year. After Captain Kirk and friends retired, it was Captain Picard's turn. Their first film came months after the show broadcast its final episode.""Star Trek: Generations"" does not begin in the 24th century. Original show stars Kirk (William Shatner), Scotty (James Doohan), and Checkov (Walter Koenig) attend the maiden voyage of the new USS Enterprise B. Unfortunately, the undermanned ship picks up a distress call from two ships caught in some kind of energy ribbon that will soon crush them. With no other ship in range, they manage to save 47 passengers, but at a very steep price. The electrifying opener is the movie's highlight and sets up the two most important story lines.Seventy-eight years later, Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart) and the Enterprise D are sent to investigate the attack of a Federation Space Station orbiting the Amagossa Star. Here, the crew meets a scientist named Dr. Soran (Malcolm McDowell), seen earlier as a survivor of the energy ribbon's carnage. Upon repeated insistence, Soran is allowed to return to the station, and then becomes hostile.I saw the movie before I saw the show, and after seeing ""First Contact."" I enjoyed it then, and now, after seeing episodes the show, I believe it does an acceptable job of transferring the characters from television to screen. ""Star Trek: The Motion Picture"" and ""The Wrath of Kahn"" introduced the original crew to theater, but neither did well at using all of its characters. ""Generations"" does.There are also new challenges, such as the new emotion chip installed in Data (Brent Spiner). While the effect is amusing the first time he drinks a beverage and hates it, the humor begins to become lame. The chip hampers the investigation when Data starts laughing at jokes he heard years ago, then feels fear and remorse.The Star Trek films have a rich history of great villains. First there is Ricardo Montalban's Khan, Christopher Lloyd's Kruge, then Christopher Plummer's General Chang. McDowell takes the standard left by films II, III and VI and lives up to it. Soran's singular obsession has so consumed him that he does not care how many people he murders in blind pursuit of his goal. Soran is quieter than the others, but his peerless scientific knowledge makes him the deadliest foe yet.Sadly, the script is filled with mistakes. Soran must manipulate the ribbon to achieve his goal, yet he seemed to be succeeding when he was beamed off the doomed ship at the beginning. Its speed is another problem. It covers the incredible distance between Amagossa and Veridian in a scant few days, yet it takes several minutes to pass through Veridian III's atmosphere during the climax. According to the simulation, it should not enter the atmosphere, until its course changes. Clock errors also hurt the illusion. The Enterprise B's hull integrity reads 82 percent. Twenty seconds later, it is down to 40, yet the ship lasts for several more minutes. Captain Harriman (Alan Ruck, looking fifteen years older than he did in ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"") volunteers go to the deflector control then Captain Kirk halts him. What does he do? He stops to think for several seconds while the ship is being ripped to pieces. Later on comes the annoying cliché where one person tries to pull another from danger, their hands cannot reach, the second slips away, and the first can magically reach him now.This film should have won a Visual Effects Oscar. I have seen two of the other three nominees, including the winner, and neither has as impressive effects. The scene where Picard watches a star shrink right in front of him is the most astounding visual in the series, including the three films that were made later.Then there is the meeting between Kirk and Picard. Patrick Stewart is universally acknowledged as a far better actor, but seeing Shatner's screen presence is more riveting. Watching to two together shows just how awesome of an icon Captain Kirk has become. Dennis McCarthy's soundtrack does not rate as one Star Trek's best, but his theme featured in the horse-riding scene rings of pure beauty.Kirk at one point says, ""Who am I to argue with the captain of the Enterprise?"" With those words, the baton is officially passed. It may be weaker than their future adventures, but the maiden voyage of the Next Generation crew earns a recommendation and six out of ten.",Star Trek - Generations

I had no problem with the storyline which many found weak, laughed up a storm at the humour, loved the musical score, was dazzled by the special effects, was impressed by the acting (superior to that of the cast of the older series), and recognised the climax at the correct point in the film - the meeting of Kirk and Picard - old and new captains of the Enterprise. I preferred this film, the seventh installment in the Star Trek films, to the eighth episode ""First Contact"" which I found over-acted and containing unnecessary decline in the rectitude of the crew.",Star Trek - Generations
116,MovieJunkie1976,The End and The Beginning...,8,13 December 2014,"***Warning! Spoiler Information Inside***After the send off that was Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country(1991) , Paramount of course realized that the success of Television's Star Trek the Next Generation , Which lead to the spin-off Star Trek : Deep Space Nine , also could lead to another series of films with this popular new crew. So we got Star Trek: Generations, designed to deliver Jean-Luc Picard(Patrick Stewart) into the center seat.Picard and Company find themselves thrust into the plans of mad scientist Dr. Soran (Malcom McDowell) who is seeking to return to a sort of interstellar haven known as the ""Nexus"". Dr. Soran, like any mad scientist type is unconcerned who or what is hurt by this affair , so long as he achieves his aim. This all is timed wonderfully as Capt. Picard is confronted with the sudden death of family , and Data(Brent Spiner) is enabled with a special chip allowing him to experience emotions for the first time.The script is skillfully written, and the superb tasking of director David Carson (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine/""Emissary"" Episodes 1&2)makes the movie a natural view.

120,jjgooner,They Should Have Ended It After The Last One,2,1 July 2013,"Star Trek Generations*1/2 (out of 4)113 mins/ PGCast: Patrick Stewart, Jonathan Frakes, Brent Spiner, LeVar Burton, Michael Dorn, Gates McFadden, Marina Sirtis, William Shatner, James Doohan, Whoopi Goldberg, Walter Koenig, Malcolm McDowell, Alan RuckDirector: David CarsonPlot: Captain Picard must team up with Captain Kirk to stop a crazy scientist from destroying a whole planetary system in order to enter a world of happiness. JJ's Verdict: Many believe that Star Trek V: The Final Frontier is the worst of the series. I however, believe that Star Trek Generations is the worst of the series. After the success of Star Trek VI, Paramount must have been wondering what to do with what has at that point, become a great franchise. Of course, bring in a new cast and start again with Star Trek. Now this would have been fine, had they decided that some people (actually quite a lot of people) had never seen The Next Generation TV series and so needed a nice and easy to understand introduction to the characters. However, they didn't bother to introduce us to any of the characters or their backgrounds, or their relationships with other characters, or even their names until about half way through (and still you're struggling to remember who is who). Further on in the film, they want you to feel emotional towards these characters, but you can't because, as the viewer, you have no connection with them. This new crew and ship, set in the 24th century, while not a bad bunch of characters, do not capture the magic of the original crew and considering they had been on a TV show for 7 years, their chemistry is extremely poor and lacklustre. Now to the actual plot.... Kirk is guest of honour on the maiden voyage of the Enterprise B. But when a mysterious energy ribbon forces the Enterprise to save the ship's passengers, it comes at a cost: the death of Captain Kirk. Meanwhile, eighty years into the future, Captain Picard of the Enterprise D is up against evil scientist Soran, who is destroying planets so that he can reach Nexus, a mind matrix of happiness. Needing help, Picard somehow finds Kirk in the Nexus and the two team up to defeat Soran. Although the film is marketed as a battle involving captains from past and future, Shatner's role in the film is nothing more than a glorified cameo and you end up wondering whether Picard actually needs Kirk. Their scenes, although fun and full of references that Trekkies will love, are extremely silly and unnecessarily boring and slow. Throughout the film, threatening situations appear out of nowhere and while the action pieces are well set-up they are confusingly executed. Many other things are confusing and unexplained like how Picard gets out of the Nexus and it never tells the viewer how much time travel actually happens in this film. The only positives in this horrendous film are the short appearances of James Doohan and Walter Koenig as their original crew characters and the performances of British actors Patrick Stewart and Malcolm McDowell as Picard and Soran. Stewart has such a commanding presence on screen and the way he deals with emotional stress with his ageing self is superior to Shatner's in past instalments. Malcolm McDowell, most famous for playing a psychopath in Stanley Kubrick's ultra violent A Clockwork Orange, is both freaky and frightening in a very good performance. With three screen icons in its cast, it seems ridiculous that Star Trek Generations could be anything but good. Of course, it doesn't work that way in the film industry and even actors as good as Shatner, Stewart and McDowell can't stop this series 7th instalment from being a downright failure.",Star Trek - Generations
121,sedativchunk,A mixed bag of goods for Star Trek fans,6,14 July 2013,"I've seen ""Star Trek Generations"" (STG) hundreds of times being a huge Star Trek fan. Recently I've watched it again from beginning to end in HD. Having watched watched pretty much every episode of all the Star Trek TV shows and all of the movies (including the newest ""Into Darkness""), I felt the need to write a new, updated review for my take on this film. For many years, I hated this film as most other Star Trek fans have over the years. There many bad things about this movie. From the storyline to minor things like random changing between the standard TNG uniforms, this movie had a ""wild"" things going on. However, with all the shortcomings of this movie, after recently re-watching this film I've had a change of heart about my attitude towards this film.The good sides of this movie: STG is still a good, quality Star Trek film. The camera work, set design, costumes, and the works were all done with superb quality. After having watched most of TNG over recently, I've come to appreciate the nice budget this film got. The CGI, for the most part, is great. The shots of the Enterprise D were fantastic and a huge step up from the TV show models, from the flying through space to the destruction of the ship. In HD, this movie really pops for being almost 20 years old already. Although some find Data's behavior over the top in this film, I found it hilarious and if you are truly a TNG fan you will enjoy Brent Spiner's performance. We even get to see Spot, Data's cat again! Lastly, although I'm not a fan of the story, the villain is great and the concept behind ""the nexus"" is intriguing. Now for the bad sides of this film: the rest of the storyline! Simply put, STG has too much going on at once. They tried to cram too many things into this movie, making it a loyal TNG film while honoring Captain Kirk's history. The main thing that hurts this film and made many fans including myself dislike it, was the death of Captain Kirk. Captain Kirk's character was forced into this film. I found it completely unnecessary to ever make Picard and Kirk ever meet face-to-face in the first place. And the way William Shatner's Captain Kirk was killed off; I have and always will find it insulting and just plain bad for such a legendary TV icon. Although the story was interesting, in the end, TNG could have had a great start on the big screen without the ""passing of the torch"" from Kirk to Picard. The way ""The Undiscovered Country"" left off was perfect. Kirk has his last voyage in Enterprise and that was it. Instead they forcibly brought him back in this film as an excuse to involve him with TNG's storyline. In conclusion ""Star Trek Generations"" is a decent Star Trek film. If you can get past the mixed timelines/story and enjoy the good sides of this film, it is still an enjoyable movie with some hidden surprises. With that being said, though, this movie at heart is a TNG film. If you're not a TNG fan, you're going to hate this film. I also don't thing this is a good Star Trek film for the general audience. Unless you're a Star Trek fan, you probably won't ""get"" this movie. Of the TNG franchise, I still thing the best of the bunch is ""First Contact"".",Star Trek - Generations
122,yasenkiranov,The next generation's transition into a movie didn't go so well,2,9 October 2012,"First of all,I would like to point out,I watched this movie before I watched ""The Next Generation"" and I was confused as hell.This is one of the major problems of this movie-if you haven't watched TNG,or even worse,this is the first Star Trek movie you watch you will probably never want to watch anything Star Trek related again.Several days after I watched the movie I took a look at some of the first TNG episodes and the movie started to become more understandable.After I watched the first two seasons of TNG,I decided that maybe I was too quick to judge the movie the first time,so i watched it again.And guess what,it sucked.I think,the fact that this movie is a TNG spin off is the source of most of it's problems. TNG had episodes entirely dedicated to the development of a single character.Data has the most(about 10 in the first two seasons in total).The average runtime for a TNG episode is 40 minutes.That makes for about 8 hours of character development only for Data! The movie,of course, can't afford that much time.Only Picard and Data get any development and it feels very rushed and unnatural.Data literally decides to install the emotion chip in 5 minutes.And the whole nexus/alternate universe thing is not very believable,I know this is Star Trek,but still it seems way too convenient.I think this movie rivals ""The final frontier"" for worst Star Trek movie.",Star Trek - Generations
123,CalvinValjean,An In-Depth Review,6,17 February 2007,"One does have to admire Star Trek: Generations and what it tries to do. In short, it is given the difficult task of having to bring closure in two ways: 1. Closure for the character of Kirk, who's been around since the beginning of all Star Trek, and 2. Closure for the TNG series, which had just wrapped, and now had to destroy their Enterprise-D set before moving to further adventures. For the most part, you have a success until the last act.We start with a prologue with Kirk, Scotty, and Chekov which is well done, plus it's nice too see Alan Ruck show up. Kirk acts a little different than he does in the TOS movies (more on that later). There is then a clever transition to 80 years later, aboard the holodeck. For the next hour and a half, you have a great ST movie. All the TNG cast is there and Riker, Troi, Crusher, and Whoopi Goldberg are all GIVEN SOMETHING TO DO (this became a problem in the later movies, which focused on Picard and Data, and the rest of the gang felt tacked on). The story is solid, there're moments of humor, philosophical ideas behind the Nexus, and Malcolm McDowell plays a nice villain; he doesn't have much screen time, but is still well acted and had a great backstory.Where the film starts to falter is when Kirk and Picard meet side by side. The scenes fall flat for several reasons: 1. The idea of the two of them meeting sounds great in theory and may excite fans, but the truth is that they're very different characters, don't really have the best chemistry or make all that great a team. 2. The premise of the Nexus starts to seem contrived, just a plausible explanation so both characters can meet, and it raises more questions than anything else. 3. The biggest problem of all is that Shatner never seems to fully get into the character of Kirk. He plays him as just a character making one-liners, winking at the camera; he knows he's just making an extended cameo. This may really be the fault of the script's; Ronald D. Moore and Brannon Braga had written for TNG and had never written Kirk's character before. That leads into the ending...MAJOR SPOILER! Others have said so before me: the emotional impact of Kirk's death is somewhat lost because he is a supporting character in this story, and we do not see him grow very much. This is not to say it's all bad; I do very much like the idea that Picard is the only witness to his predecessor's death.And that's Generations pretty much. Great film right up till the end. One Final Note: it's become a well-known story that Brent Spiner hates cats and when filming the scene when Data is reunited with his cat, he remarked ""Does it have to be the cat? Couldn't he find Geordi?"" Frankly, I think that would've worked MUCH BETTER, and been a great redemption for Data. Shame they didn't follow his advice.The result is a good ST film, but not as great as the classics in the series: 2, 4, 6, and 8.",Star Trek - Generations
124,whizkids,Hooray! Yay! Woo-hoo!,9,10 May 2004,"I can't exactly tell you why I chose those words for my summary, but if you've read my comments on anything to do with TOS, you'll have an idea of what I'm cheering about. This is the first TNG movie, and the last time we see the Enterprise D (I hope that isn't a spoiler). There's an El-Aurian who has gone into the Nexus and been pulled out thanks to Kirk (he's a pain for everybody, isn't he?), and now he wants back in. And nothing, not even a star will get in his way. If anything does, he destroys it. Literally. It's up to an emotional Picard whose just found out he's the last of his family to stop him.
The storyline is very good, especially because Data's dream of having emotions is finally realized, albiet with some, shall we say, mishaps?

There was a lame plot where the cartoonishly mad scientist villain Dr. Soren engineers the destruction of a planet to change the course of and once more be part of the Nexus, a dimensional fantasy world where Picard and Kirk live out the lives they wished they had made for themselves. Of course Picard convinces Kirk to help him change the events created by Soren and the Nexus apparently allows for time travel as well as being a fantasy paradise type place. This doesn't really resemble a film but seems more like a two-part episode of the TNG series, albeit a very bad one. Geordi LaForge is taken prisoner and turned into an unwitting spy by the Duras sisters and Data gets turned into a grinning idiot by his emotion chip as well. Aside those things the writers destroy Picard's character in this film through the needless deaths of his family making him seem to have a problem just being in command. Picard was a great captain-strong, compassionate, determined. He was treated badly in this film. As for Kirk, his death seems a little cheap.

Enterprise D? We'll get a new ship. And there's the Duras sisters lurking at the back. We certainly won't want those any more.Kirk's role is so short lived it was hardly worth bringing him back (and watching Shatner waddle around makes me think they should have called the film Star Trek 7 - The Search for Kirk's Waistline). As for Kirk's death scene that was just an insult. Falling off a bridge. It's what I'd do, not a space legend (still don't know why there's an iron bridge on an uninhabited planet)There's also an irrelevant subplot featuring Data and his emotion chip, though Data's life form song is a great moment.Overall, a wasted opportunity",Star Trek - Generations

The Next Generation cast obviously have a great love for their characters and bring all their skills to the fore, and the classic cast ham it up as only Star Trek fans can appreciate.  You might have to love Star Trek, though, to love and understand this film, but if you don't it's still a nice space adventure sci fi film with heroics, strange sights, and good action.

The actual 'plot' involving Soran screams 'Hollywood': ""the bad guy has been planning to do X, and he just got the final piece for his weopon. Now, we have to stop him or the universe will die.""The early scenes with Picard and Data are excellent. They each unfold in a very precise way, building on each previous scene as they go. Special praise must be given to the writers for delaying the revelation of the death of Picards brother and nephew. He learns of the news in his first scene in the film, and then several more follow where his interactions with the crew become more strained. Finally, he tells Troi of what has happened, and Stewart's acting skills deliver the scene will full emotional force.Data's scenes are hilarious, and while at first I thought this sub-plot was disconnected from the rest of the film, I now see it as running parallel to the main plot. Picard must let go of his attachment to his idealized future (with a heir to his family name), and Data must let go of his attachment to his pre-emotion chip 'good old days' when he didn't have the burden of humanity to contend with.Of course, all of this is shoved aside for about 40 minutes of silliness, involving Captain Kirk being recruited to help Picard PUNCH Soran only MINUTES before he can launch his missile (rather than hours, or days! Picard can go ""anywhere, anytime"" according to Guinan). The whole 'Nexus' sequence is effective, but pales next to similar sequences done throughout the Next Generation run (as well as Star Trek V: The Final Frontier). Further, for the last 2/5 of the film, the remaining Next Generation crew are completely absent! Wouldn't the original idea of having Kirk join the Enterprise-D crew have been far more exciting, heroic, and not so low-key? The sequences on the planet with Soran and Picard look as if they're filmed on the same rocky formation used in the ST:TOS episode 'Arena', as well as Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey (and maybe they are, knowing the corners that are sometimes cut with this franchise). A space battle involving all the characters would have been far more satisfying...Kirk could've gone down with the back section, and the crashing of the saucer section could've been saved for the finale.To recap: Kirk is recruited to PUNCH Soran. That's it. There is nothing else unique about what he adds to the mix. Not his cunning, not his notorious 'breaking the rules' (see Star Trek II), nothing!A very unsatisfying end for Captain Kirk, and a very awkward beginning for the film series by the Next Gen crew. Unfortunately, the quality of their movie outings would get far worse very soon.6/10",Star Trek - Generations

While the plot wasn't as good as VI or maybe even First Contact, it was solid, especially with Kirk.  My only big quabbles are more technical.  First, the awful lighting.  It's either too dark or too bright to be Star Trek.  Second, the burial of Kirk. Wouldn't he have a large funeral like Spock's?  After all, he's done his bit for king and country.

133,george_cherucheril,Terrible,2,10 November 2012,"This movie is a poor transition to the next generation. Perhaps this is why the next generation never caught on. The premise is flawed that Captain Kirk would ""apparently"" die saving his crew only to be suspended somewhere in time until some 80 years later when he is released. Then Kirk gets to work with Captain Picard and help him kill the bad guy only to get killed himself and then Picard is the only person with him when he dies.Star Trek could have made a much better movie. They should have employed a storyline where Kirk and his crew stumble upon a future problem and travel through time to help bail out Picard's crew. Thus, the experience of Kirk trumps the technology of Picard. Also, Picard and crew could drop hints about Kirk and his crew's fate. Then at the end of the movie we could have Picard and his crew watch Kirk and crew go back in time. That is how the baton should have been handed over to the generations team.I caught this movie on TV today and it looks stiff and dated.",Star Trek - Generations

135,Alan One,A plot device flying through space,4,3 November 1999,"In this ""passing of the torch"" film, the cinematic Star Trek franchise transfers from the crew of the original Star Trek to the ""Next Generation"" crew.  Enormous effort has already been devoted to bringing characters from the original series into the Next Generation series; Scotty, Spock, and Sarek are among the ""crossovers.""  Although a pleasure for trekkers, this rarely results in compelling screenwriting, and Generations is no exception.The problem here, as elsewhere, is the dreaded ""plot device,"" a fantastic happening or object that allows a character to skip over decades unchanged. In Generations, the device is an ""energy ribbon,"" which zooms through space, destroying some things, but also snatching some people into a fantasy land where dreams become reality.  In the first sequence, Kirk is one of those snatched (although others assume he is destroyed).  This allows him to meet Picard, who is snatched 80 years later by the same ribbon.So far, we're running at about the usual level of belief-suspension for a Star Trek plot, but the unlikely Kirk-Picard summit precludes even more outrageous reasoning.  First, the ribbon's fantasy land is so utterly attractive that a scientist named Soran (who had a close encounter with the ribbon years ago) willingly dispatches millions of innocent lives to arrange another, more permanent rendezvous.  Despite this, Picard and Kirk have no difficulty seeing through the facade.  ""It's not real, is it?"" Kirk asks, though if it's real enough to include all the other trappings of normal life, it should be able to replicate the feeling of realness, shouldn't it?Picard (with the help of Guinan) has no problem moving from his fantasy (a sort of Dickensian Christmas with a large family) to Kirk's (a woodsy spot where he chops wood and cooks breakfast for a slumbering lover).  Why not pop over to Soran's fantasy and talk some sense into him while he's at it? Nevermind.  Instead, they jointly emerge from the ribbon, back into the real world, though not at the point they left it -- in fact, they're nowhere near the ribbon when they come out.  How did they manage that?  And if they're not constrained by time or space, why not pop out at some point where they can nab Soran without a struggle?  The answer, of course, is that it wouldn't make for an exciting movie, though movies with such shaky conceptual frameworks rarely excite on any but the most basic levels.Generations isn't devoid of merit.  Malcolm McDowell does a pleasantly evil turn as Soran, and Brent Spiner portrays an appropriately jangled Data, who has just installed an emotion chip.  It's fun to watch the Next Generation working with a Hollywood budget, but director Berman often falls short of the task.  More than once, he does sharp zooms on characters' faces as they are about to die violently, a technique I thought had perished in the 70s. Still, if you're in a tight spot for a Star Trek fix, this will probably do it for you, plot device and all.",Star Trek - Generations
136,Borg7o9,"Good trek, but not a great film",9,16 December 1998,"This was a very interesting story, although I think they could have integrated the two Enterprise crews a little better.  The imagery in the film was rather unique and intriguing, and I really enjoyed how the story brought out Picard's fears of being the last of his line (a fear that I have, as well).  Not the greatest Trek flick ever, but I did really enjoy the simplicity of it.  Better then both 'First Contact' and 'Insurrection' by my book.",Star Trek - Generations
137,reedcom,"Not great, but I get it now",5,19 January 2020,"I recently re-watched Generations and it was better than I remember. The plot overall mostly made sense, Data's emotion chip jokes were good. I understood why Picard longed for a family. The crash of the saucer was well done. I appreciate the clever way the writers got Picard and Kirk to meet up as the studio demanded.However there were plenty of little things which could have been done better. The overall plot was not epic, it would have been better as a TV episode. The BIG DEATH could have been better. All the scenes on the planet at the climax were slow. They could have used a different ship to battle against than another bird of prey. The old cast did little, and Spock was missing. Why torture Geordi for info on Trilithium when the whole plan was finished, and a few other plot holes.The studio demands to get Kirk and Picard together in a specific way hurt the film. No franchise more clearly shows the harm of studio interference as this one. Like clock-work, every other film the studio seems to interfere and mess it up, and then they try harder to make a better film next time.. This one was one of the weaker films, but still watchable.",Star Trek - Generations

Since it was Picard's ideal to save the planet and the Enterprise etc. - that's exactly what the Ribbon gave him. It's never really explained how they leave the Ribbon; they're on horseback on second they trot into a flash of light and... then the next scene they're on the Planet with Soren (where happened to the horses. It fits that Kirk (also still being in the Ribbon) needs to die in Picard's universe because, as long as Picard believes Kirk is dead, there is no clash or paradox. Kirk probably immediately went back to chopping wood after he 'died' on Veridian 3. Everything that happens afterword - Borg, etc. is all Picard's illusion in the Ribbon.

140,restin_him,A slight miss in the hand off.,6,4 August 2006,"The original crew of the Enterprise is gone. Their time of adventure has ended and they are now passing the torch to a new crew. Well at least the cinema torch.Generations is supposed to be the great connection between Star Trek and Star Trek TNG. We get a chance to see what Kirks fate in life was and his eventual return to help the new Capitan of the Enterprise. An amazing concept that creates a fun yet really flawed film.First lets look at the good. FX are great and it is amazing to see the Enterprise D on the big screen. I was impressed with many visuals in this film especially a certain scene of crashing I won't mention so others won't get ruined by it.That acting was very good as well. It is obvious that the crew of TNG know and love each other and just enjoy working together. Shatner and Stewart also have some great interactions that I found fun and enjoyable to watch.To bad there are bads to this however.Probably the greatest flaw to this film is that the plot feels only half thought out. We get introductions to so many extra things that are supposed to add depth (I assume) but never do. Data gets an emotion chip, Picards brother and nephew die, Kirk in the ribbon, and many more. This film seemed to have many good concepts running together causing the writers to make it hard to focus on one thing. To often I found myself wanting to get into situations deeper only to be left hanging.My biggest gripe with this film is another plot issue and also something of a spoiler, so skip the next paragraph if you don't want it ruined...Picard ends up in the ribbon with Kirk. By now we know that you basically live out your own personal heaven in the ribbon. It is supposed to be so perfect that it has driven one guy made and caused Guinan a lot of emotional stress. You figure this would be a very hard process of getting Picard and Kirk to leave. Yeah all of ten minutes to leave. Not only that but Guinan appears out of no where to push Picard out. How the heck is she here? We get a very short sad reason and picard gets up thinks about it and leaves his own personal heaven with little issue. Kirk takes more of the ten minutes to get out but hey, he is a lot older by now right.I am done with my spoilers now. Again the issue comes to not enough depth in important areas in the plot.Oh, as Trek fan I have one final problem. They destroyed my favorite Enterprise ina very lack luster way.Enough nerd crying.This film is alright, not a horrid mess. However this film is also lacking in important areas.

Captain Picard to stand up and begin doing a whole song and dance about the Nexus? While the story wasn't quite as good as I expect from a Star Trek movie, I still thought it was very good. The Nexus was, and still is, a very good concept for a Star Trek movie--a universe where time has no meaning does appeal to me greatly.And it still provides all the action and adventure that most of the Star Trek movies (except for the first one) give.So, all in all, while not as good story wise; in every other aspect, it is perfect.",Star Trek - Generations

Considering that just 3 years earlier Undiscovered Country came out and was hands down among the best Star Trek movies. This is a very weak follow-up of that film.The opening of the film is quite OK but from there it just goes downhill. There is a lot of boring screen time filler scenes that simply do not serve a purpose and while the movie is redeemed by some really great scenes and some elements that make Star Trek so great. Sadly this is just a film with so much missed opportunity.Considering they managed to bring together Kirk and Picard into one film you would expect so, so much more. Even if it was a film with just Picard it would have been quite mediocre.It just lacks focus and direction in the script writing and in general it just feels like they really had to pull out all movie clichés just to get the story to work.It is watchable and it can be entertaining at times so I would still say to give it a watch especially if you are doing a Star Trek Bluray marathon (like I am doing) but just be prepared to experience a mediocre Star Trek film.",Star Trek - Generations

Patrick Stewart on the other hand is a talented performer in every role I've seen. A consummate actor and a true professional of his craft.There was very little transitioning since the TOS cast had minimal parts. This was more of a ""give up the ghost"" movie to tell them to ""get the hell out of the way"".

147,fox_muldur,"One of the best, next to ST:First Contact",10,23 August 2000,"This is undoubtedly one of the best Star Trek films next to First contact. The special FX were superb, the plot was excellent, acting was excellent, and one of the most striking things about the film was the beautiful filming locations.The beginning started off a little weak but towards the middle of the film the movie began to strut it's stuff. Once the plot forms after the destruction of a Federation science station the movie will not fail you. The Enterprise-Klingon battle scene was excellent, and the factor which allows the Enterprise to win is also very interesting. Although the part on the planets surface where Picard tries to stop Soran (Malcolm McDowell) was a little weak, especially where Picard magically escapes Soran's 3 disruptor blasts unharmed, the scenes after that were spectacular. After entering the Nexus and realizing he must go back to save the crew of the Enterprise (and the Solar System they are in) Picard seeks Kirk's help (William Shatner). I was truly amazed by the filming locations, they were downright beautiful! Kirk and Picard fit very nicely into it, and it is easy to see why Kirk would not want to leave ""the Nexus"". The ending fight between Soran and the Kirk-Picard team was a bit sub-par compared to other ST movies, but none-the-less it put a very nice touch to the end of the movie. The way that they leave the story open to a another movie is very well done, and I have to say it fits in very nice with ST: First Contact.I would definitely recommend renting or buying this movie, and if you watched it on TV then I have to tell you to go rent the movie, because many scenes were ""edited"" out to fit the movie in a 2-hour timeslot.",Star Trek - Generations

The only downfall is the bad lighting of the Enterprise. Patrick Stewert, shines as Picard, who is dealing with the death of his brother and nephew, and his slow decisions are the result of this tragedy.

Brent Spiner is the only one who gets to really show off his character, while Picard's emotions seem to take away the drama from the destruction of the Entreprise.

This only matter degrades the movie enormously.It was good to see Kirk and Picard together, but in some parts Picard looses points when he is compared with Kirk. Malcom McDowell makes Soran a very  good villain, his  lines of `...time is a predator' at the Enterprise's lounge and on the Veridian planet are terrific and makes you think about it a lot.

Sure, that would have been predictable, that he would see it, but quite frankly I think that's what the fans would have liked.  They would have loved to see Kirk on the bridge of the Enterprise-D.  Or at least that's my opinion.

Great season with terrific episodes like ""Descent Part II"", ""Genesis"", ""Journey's End"", and ""All Good Things. . ."" just to name a few. It had already been announced as ""Star Trek: The Next Generation""'s final season. With ""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" in its second season and everyone preparing for the launch of UPN and ""Star Trek: Voyager"" in January 1995, all eyes were pointed at the 2 hour, final episode of ""The Next Generation."" With the conclusion of the series in May 1994, we wouldn't have to wait long to see Captain Jean-Luc Picard's crew and the U.S.S. Enterprise, with the release of ""Star Trek: Generations"" in the fall of 1994. The movie had been hugely hyped up as ""the death of Captain Kirk."" Sureley that would attract Trekkers and non-Trekkers alike, but somewhere in the hype, something was lost, and it was the story.The movie starts back in the 23rd century where ""Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country"" left off. The U.S.S. Enterprise-A is decommissioned, and its crew has retired from Starfleet. With the launch of the U.S.S. Enterprise-B in this film, we have our guests of honor: Commander Pavel Chekov, Captain Montgomery Scott (who guest starred in ""Star Trek: The Next Generation""'s' sixth season episode - ""Relics"") and Captain James T. Kirk. As the Enterprise ends it maiden voyage, it receives a distress call from two El Aurian ships caught in an energy ribbon. The Enterprise hurries to save them, but one ship is destroyed. Scotty manages to save 47 from the other ship, but soon the Enterprise becomes stuck in the ribbon. Their only hope, is to use the deflector dish to fire an anti-matter discharge into the ribbon that would free the ship. Captain Kirk hurries to make the modifications. In the nick of time, the Enterprise is freed, but the ribbon leaves its mark, as it tears a large chunk of the secondary hull (containing Kirk) away from the ship. Kirk is presumed dead.Flash-forward 78 years. On a holographic replica of the frigate Enterprise on the holodeck of the U.S.S. Enterprise-D, Lieutenant Worf is promoted to lieutenant commander. In his struggle to understand human emotions, Data attempts to get into the spirit of things by pushing Dr. Beverly Crusher over the bow the frigate Enterprise, but gets mixed results from his peers. Also, Captain Picard gets a message that his brother's family (last seen in the fourth season's ""Family"") has died in a fire. Picard becomes very depressed. But in addition to that, a solar observatory has been attacked and left in ruin by the Romulans. Among the survivors is a Dr. Tolian Soran, one of the 47 that Scotty saved 78 years ago. Meanwhile, Data decides to implant his emotion chip that he recovered from his evil brother Lore in ""Descent Part II."" Once the chip is in place, Data begins to act like a jackass - constantly laughing at everything.Commander Riker informs Picard that the Romulans were on the observatory looking for some of their trilithium. Picard orders Data and Lt. Commander Geordi La Forge to search the observatory for the resin. Once on the observatory, Data malfunctions. In an attempt to return to the Enterprise, Data and Geordi are taken captive by Dr. Soran. Meanwhile, Picard tells Counselor Deanna Troi was has happened to his family. In the midst of their discussion, the star in the system mysteriously explodes and they've lost contact with Data and Geordi. The explosion of the star has produced a shockwave that will destroy everything in the system. Riker and Worf attempt to save Data and Geordi. Soran abducts Geordi and beams to a Klingon ship, captained by the Duras sisters last seen in the episode ""Inheritance."" Riker, Data, and Worf return to the Enterprise and warp away, just as the oberservatory is destroyed.As Dr. Soran tortures Geordi for information on trilithium, Picard learns that Data's emotion chip has been fused into his neural net and cannot be removed. However, Data remains competent enough to uncover Soran's plan. He is destroying stars to alter the energy ribbons course to Veridian III so he can return to the ""Nexus."" Picard learns from Guinan, the bartender on the Enterprise, and who was also one of the 47 that the Nexus is like heaven, and Soran has become obsessed with returning there. Once at Veridian III, the Enterprise encounters the Klingons. They agree to trade Geordi for Captain Picard, if Picard can first talk to Soran down on the planet. They agree, and Geordi returns to the Enterprise. However, the Klingons use Geordi's VISOR to spy on the Enterprise. On the planet, Picard seems hopeless trying to convince Soran not to destroy the star, which in turn, will destroy a populated planet.The Klingons see a console on the Enterprise that will allow their photon torpedoes to pass through the Enterprise's shields. The Enterprise is attacked and heavily damaged. Data devises a plan to force the Klingons to cloak, which will lower their shields. The plan works and the Klingons are destroyed. However, the Enterprise's warp core has been too heavily damaged and is going to breach. Riker orders the evacuation of the secondary hull and the ship to be separated. With the crew evacuated and the ship separated, it slowly flies away, but the core breach explodes and the shockwave catches the Enterprise's saucer module. With all controls off-line, the Enterprise crashes on the planet.With no one to stop Soran, he destroys the star. The ribbon catches him and Picard and they are transported to the Nexus. But the shockwave destroys Veridian III, the Enterprise, and all the planets in the system. Once in th e Nexus, Picard convinces Captain Kirk, who was also caught in the Nexus 78 years earlier to come to the 24th century with him to stop Soran. Time repeats, the Enterprise crashes, and Picard and Kirk fight Soran. Soran is killed, and the explosion is averted, but Captain Kirk is killed as well. Picard buries him on the planet, and three Starfleet vessels begin to save the Enterprise crew. Although there were no deaths, the Enterprise can't be salvaged. The ships speed back to Earth to await construction of the Enterprise-E.***The story itself would be pretty good as the final episode of ""The Next Generation"", but everyone was looking forward to the death of Captain Kirk, and the ""Next Generation"" storyline really interfered with that. But all in all, this is an OK movie.MusicWas composed by Dennis McCarthy, who also composed the music for the series. It is good and fits the movie well.SFXAs always, done by Industrial Light and Magic. The Enterprise destruction was a shocking piece of film. After seven years, it is finally destroyed. The crash sequence is also well done. Other mentions go to the damaging of the Enterprise-B. The only problem is that they used old footage of the Klingon ship being destroyed for the film.OverallThe movie may have been one of the best from 1994. But, as it compares to other Star Trek films as it falls victim to the Star Trek ""odd numbered curse"", you may want to see ""Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan"" or ""Star Trek: First Contact"" first. Those movies really shine as the crown jewls of the film franchise.**1/2 out of ****",Star Trek - Generations
155,j-kirby247,One of my favorite movies.,9,8 November 2011,"This movie, in my humble opinion, is the best Star Trek made.Basic story guide: On the maiden voyage of the Enterprise-B, guests Scotty, Checkov, and James Kirk all arrive as special guests. While investigating an energy ribbon, James Kirk is ""killed."" Seven decades later, Picard must stop Saron, a man so hell-bent on getting back into the said ""ribbon"" which is actually a temporal window into any point in history that the person wants to go. But to get back, Saron must destroy planetary stars in different sectors to alter the gravimetric forces in a sector to move the ribbon where he wants to go. A side effect (and i use the term lightly) of the destruction of these stars is a shock wave which destroys everything in a star system (ships, stations, planets, etc). Picard must stop him or 230 million people will die as a result, not including his own crew.(SPOILER ALERT!) if this movie guide interests you at all, read no further.The destruction of the Enterprise is really dramatic, gripping, and one hell of a ride. I can honestly say that most of the bad reviews for this movie are a direct result of people who are angry that Enterprise is destroyed, or for the fact that the James Kirk finally dies. They don't understand that this is a send off, and that this movie is where EVERYTHING changes.I suspect that some find this movie boring.Some may complain about the ""holes"" in the story line.But the movie itself is a lot better than Insurecction.Over all...9/10. it does have its flaws but overall it's worth a watch.",Star Trek - Generations
156,Hotstar,Vastly Underrated,10,13 February 2007,"Generations has long been criticised as one of the poorer Star Trek films but I disagree with that assessment.One of the focal criticisms people make about the movie is Kirk's role in the film. William Shatner is afforded nothing more than a glorified cameo. However, I think this adds to the picture as opposed to detracting from it; Generations is a Next Generation movie, so to feature Kirk prominently would be a mistake and a slight on TNG cast, who all acted ably in their first screen adventure.Also, Kirk's death (also heavily criticised) to me is well done too. The character had long stated in the series and films his destiny was to die alone; and although not strictly true, his death did seem remote and lonely and the fact he died not in a hail of bullets added to the picture in my opinion.Patrick Stewart as Picard, and Shatner demonstrated real chemistry together,and Brent Spiner as Data steals nearly all the scenes he's in; an emotion chip adds some real comic moments.Malcolm Macdowell also is a terrific villain, with a real, simple aim which thankfully makes the plot a lot clearer as science, admittedly complicates matters a bit too much in several sequences.All in all this is a terrific, traditional Trek adventure. Well worth a watch.",Star Trek - Generations
157,Penhall,Shatner saves the movie,10,20 November 1998,"Okay, I liked this movie anyway, but I agree it could have been so much better. I just saw the ridiculous comment talking about how bad we all want to see Shatner go. Listen buddy, Shatner was the BEST thing about the movie! He stole every scene he was in, and also the movie was just plain more interesting when he was on the screen. There is something that a lot of people don't get, and it really bugs me. This movie's flaws had NOTHING to do with the original series cast members. It had to do with the writers: Rick Berman, Brannon Braga, and Ronald D. Moore. Shatner didn't write the movie for Christ's sake! He was merely an actor. Think before saying stupid things like ""the movie was a vehicle for Shatner's ego""!",Star Trek - Generations
158,ensiform,Pretty poor,5,20 June 2001,"A mad alien called Soren (McDowell) threatens to destroy  an entire sun (and, of course, its planet system) in order to return to the Nexus (a place where time has no meaning, where all are ""bathed in joy""), the two captains of the Enterprise join forces to stop him.  They can do this because they are in the Nexus, after Soren fulfils his plan.  There are some fun bits here --- oddly enough, most of them with Kirk and the gang; nostalgia is always fun.  But the script is very shabby on the whole.  A subplot involving Data with an emotion chip is played out very timorously, to the point that it puzzles rather than entertains.  And plot holes abound, from the niggling question of why Data's emotions crashed at just the wrong moment (never explained) to the rather larger question of why the captains didn't exit the Nexus at a better place to stop Soren, so they didn't have the odds stacked against them so.  And it's rather facile even on its own terms; obviously, Kirk and Picard's ideas of true joy aren't domestic bliss, they're adventure and travel and challenge.  That is what they'd find in the Nexus, and so they'd never leave.  Or --- why doesn't Soren leave the Nexus, since seemingly one can, at will, and stop the captains in turn?  And so on ad infinitum and absurdum.  A rather slip-shod guilty pleasure, this.",Star Trek - Generations
159,johnno-51370,"""Oh my..."", a Perfect Storm",10,25 July 2020,"This, for me, is the perfect Star Trek movie. Even beyond that, it's a superb sci-fi action film that would rank highly in my list even if it was an entirely separate entity from the Star Trek universe. Is some of this nostalgia talking..? Possibly; I was 10 when this was first released and I can still remember the excitement I felt at the prospect of a ST movie with ""my"" crew, ship and universe, rather than just the originals. Of course, this one has both!The film starts in the TOS era, with Kirk, Scotty & Chekhov overseeing the maiden voyage of the Enterprise B. While they take it for a spin they receive a distress call from two ships that are eventually destroyed by an ""energy ribbon"" of unknown origin, with only a few survivors beamed aboard. Two of these survivors are Dr. Tolian Soran (who will go on to be the main protagonist played brilliant by Malcolm McDowell), and Guinan who goes on to become the mysterious bartender on the Enterprise D almost a century later. During the rescue mission, Captain Kirk is seemingly killed by the energy ribbon ripping a hole in the ship where he was positioned.Fast forward 78 years, and the film continues in TNG era. Captain Picard learns of the loss of two close relatives, and is seen in tears remembering them. Commander Data realises he is no longer progressing in his quest to become more human, and installs an emotion chip with the help of Geordi. The ship receives a distress call from an outpost that's under attack, and when they arrive on the scene there are only a handful of survivors of which, again, Soran is amongst their number. It transpires he is trying to harness the energy ribbon, as it leads to a heaven-like alternative existence called the Nexus where there is no time, only joy and immortality. He has enlisted the help of a Klingon Bird of Prey and it's crew in his efforts to destroy specific stars, which in turn will change gravitational pulls in order to direct the energy ribbon to the surface of a planet where he can be swept up in it. Soran escapes back to the Klingon vessel along with Geordi as a hostage, with Data paralysed by his newfound fear. The Enterprise figures out Soran's plans and hunts them down in the Viridian system, where Soran aims to destroy the star (at the expense of 230 million lives) in order to rejoin the Nexus. Picard negotiates Geordi's return in exchange for himself, and is transported to the planet's surface. The Klingons have rigged Geordi's visor and use it to learn the Enterprise shield frequency, allowing them to score direct hits with photon torpedoes and disruptors. Riker, Worf & Data use a flaw within the Bird of Prey's design to drop it's own shields, and destroy it with a single photon torpedo (and a highly satisfying call of ""fire"" from the former!).Meanwhile, Picard fails at an attempt to stop Soran and the star is destroyed. The Enterprise, which was already crippled, is destroyed along with the rest of the star system. Soran & Picard are swept into the Nexus by the energy ribbon. Picard experiences an alternate life where he has the perfect home and family. He soon realises it's not real, however, and with Guinan's help is able to move around inside the Nexus and locate Kirk. They exit the Nexus together at the point where Picard previously failed, and this time are able to kill Soran and stop the destruction of the Viridian system. Kirk is mortally wounded in the struggle, however, and his death scene is both sad and wonderful in equal measure. ""Oh my..."" he whispers as he slips away; something which stayed with me ever since I first saw it 26 years ago and made me think deeply about the afterlife.Is it flawless? No. Why would Data install an emotion chip whilst on active duty and without consulting his captain? How can multiple photon torpedoes and disruptor hits only wound a shieldless Enterprise, yet one in the opposite direction destroys a Klingon Bird of Prey instantly?Does it matter that it's flawed? No. It's a two-hour riot of all that is good about Star Trek TNG, with some great Kirk scenes thrown in for good measure. 10/10, and will take some beating by anything later in the franchise.",Star Trek - Generations

For a start the killed of Kirk was that really necessary then we have the destruction of yet another enterprise starship seems like they destroying one with each movie now. Then to add insult to injury the kill of Picard's family. So much sadness and destruction in this film. Then they made poor Jean Luc Picard cry and make commander data babble like a baby.This is just painful to watch such a pity.",Star Trek - Generations

Not only does it give the impression that it is an epic story, it also manages to give us a thoughtful metaphysical story. Change, family and loss are its major themes, and they work within the context of this story as well as within the Star Trek franchise on the whole.

The uniforms don't match. Because of sloppy editing, references are made to scenes that didn't make the final cut. And there are innumerable plot holes and inconsistencies: why does Sorin need to go to such extravagant lengths to get into the Ribbon (beyond the producers' desire for plot contrivances, that is)? Picard says he can't fly into it, but that seemed to be working pretty well in the intro. So what if the ship got destroyed? Sorin was in the process of entering the Ribbon when he was beamed out, right?Stuff like this is all over the place, but you know what? I don't care. Shut your brain off for a couple hours and it makes for pretty decent B-movie entertainment. Picard and Data are great as always, and the rest of the cast is...the rest of the cast, I guess. The crew does pretty much what Next Generation viewers are used to them doing, which I guess is good or bad depending on how you look at it. But you've got Malcolm McDowell at his most Malcolm McDowell-ish as the antagonist, and that's really all the villain any movie needs.Yeah, the even-numbered Treks all have this one beat, and so do the Motion Picture and Search for Spock, but I find its clumsiness strangely endearing for some reason.

I was surprised of how high the quality of this movie was. i'm sure allot of people think of it as two old geezers fooling around in a crappy license movie but this was quite the contrary. i almost lost track of time, i was so absorbed in how amazing the movie was. It just wasn't the fact that the two of them were together at last. The acting of Bret spinner was incredible as well.

166,Century_hades,What a waste of a film,4,29 May 2011,"Spoilers ahead! Let me start this review by saying there are only really two movies in my life that have utterly let me down, left me feeling cheated, and completely disappointed. Generations was one of the two. First I'll start with what I liked. (this will be short) The design of the enterprise B, with the excelsior design being one of my all time favorite star ship designs. Also the special effects were pretty good. Its was cool to see Kirk, and Picard on screen together.Now what I didn't like about this movie. This movie had the potential to be the best trek of them all. By pairing out both the original crew, and next gen crew. What was handed to us was a waste of a movie, and the waste of a great character.Kirk had only 30 minutes of screen time in the film so it was more like a cameo. So the audience was tricked by the marketing as to making you think he would be through the whole thing.The lighting in this movie was terrible. It was always dark on the enterprise D. I really don't know what they were trying to accomplish with this.The music was depressing, and overly sentimental. A complaint I would have about all the next gen films. Listing to the score of this film it kept saying to me: Hey this is kirks last film cry your eyes out he not coming back.This music combine with Picard learning his family burned to death in a fire. The destruction of the enterprise D, Data crying over his cat spot, and finally the lousy way they killed kirk. The movie was just a depressing downer.Finally the biggest nail in the coffin the death of kirk. Why did they kill him off? He could have lived and stayed in the 24th century. It seemed they killed him off just for the sake of killing him off. Also kirk dies as the catwalk he clings to gives out? Pretty poor send off to give such an great character.When I first heard about this movie being made I was really excited. I was expecting a full blown epic cross over of the full original cast, and their ship. With the next gen cast, and their ship. What I got was a pale, poorly done slap to the face of what could have been.I'll end this review with this. This bad poorly done movie, and the killing of kirk would come back to haunt me once more years later in 2009. When the new star trek film was release featuring Leonard Nimoy, and a recast of the original crew characters. See they tried to include Shatner in this film some how. Which if they did would have been awesome. Alas they couldn't because why? Kirk was killed off in generations. Which made me despise star trek generations even more.",Star Trek - Generations
167,b_stavisky,Jim's dead. should be treated like the animated Star Trek.,4,24 October 2000,"As much as I love Star Trek, I did not like this film.  The lighting was bad.  The bridge of the Enterprise is bright, did they forget the light bill?  Also the film was very dark, starting with Picard's loss of his brother and nephew right up until the end of the film.  I think one of the best parts was when Dr. Crusher was knocked into the water by Data.  Not that I wanted to see her hurt but she lights up any scene she is in all by herself.  The writing was weak.  The characters did not really interact as they did in the series.My biggest problem with this film is JIM KIRK gets killed! He is my hero.  He wasnt supposed to die and surely not like that.  He deserved better.  If he died with the Enterprise that would be one thing, but this Dr. Soran??????  Jim Kirk saved the Earth countless times, kept the Klingons and Federation from going to war and questioned God himself. Soran wasnt even in Kirk's league.  Malcolm McDowell who played Soran actually bragged to the media that he got to kill Kirk. Ill bet he does not go to many Star Trek conventions.The only cure for this film is to treat it like the Animated Star Trek, not canon.",Star Trek - Generations

170,BenderIsGreat,The best thing since indoor plumbing,9,7 January 2006,"I think what was great about Star Trek: Generations was the way it had me laughing one minute and crying the next! That probably sounds weird, but if you haven't seen Picard have an emotional breakdown before, it's kind of unsettling. I think the way good and bad events seemed to go hand in hand sort of emphasized the whole theme of ""time waits for no one."" Also, it was great to see the cast of the original Enterprise back in action, even if it's just Kirk, Chekov, and Scotty.In this movie, a lot of characters have revelations; Picard realizes (in a stroke of Jean-Luc brilliance) that he doesn't want what he thought he wanted his entire life, Captain Kirk faces once and for all what he's famous for escaping, and Data gets closer to humanity than he's ever been. Even though it's no surprise to see Data with emotions--having seen that in tons of episodes of TNG before--it's still entertaining.The ending was really sad for all of us Kirk fans, or for anyone who didn't want the Enterprise to get totaled. It was quite the ending, though! Guinan's innate wisdom saves the day again.",Star Trek - Generations
171,jonathanfisk,"Kinda like Obama teaming up with JFK (or Trump with Reagan, if you are so inclined) but less interesting.",6,22 July 2016,"After Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country was made, everyone had to be feeling that The Next Generation crew had to given their chance, especially after how successful the aforementioned film had been. And while I understand the excitement behind combining the two Enterprise captains, Kirk and Picard, it was a highly unnecessary step in passing the baton to the new crew.Generations has its quality moments: Kirk unease with the struggling new Enterprise captain, the always enjoyable give-and-take between LaForge and Data, the acting chops of Patrick Stewart, Riker's turn to lead an astro-naval battle against Klingons, and state-of-the-art visual effects. But overall the film fails to captivate the viewer because of very mundane plot seemingly designed solely to bridge the gap from the Original Series crew to the Next Generation. The Nexus is hardly a sinister problem since it provides so much comfort to those who fall in it (and can seemingly get out of easily). The main villain in this film is played by Caligula himself, Malcolm McDowell, who definitely brings a sinister edge to Dr. Soran. But his motivations to return to the Nexus are unremarkable aside from the fact that he clearly believes in ""the needs of the one outweigh the needs of the many,"" a truly poor choice of words from Kirk back in Search for Spock.The drama is mainly lacking in this film and it never requires the viewer to consider moral issues, like a great Trek story should, since the Nexus has almost no bearing in our real world. Yes, it can be unwise to constantly reminisce and dwell in the past or what could have been, but that usually does not have a widespread impact on society. The moment when Kirk and Picard meet is enjoyable for long-time fans of Star Trek, but The Next Generation crew has enough clout of its own, not needing the reins of Trek to be passed on to them by Kirk in this movie. Now, give this crew their very own film and see what happensSome final thoughts: It was disappointing that the audience was shown which characters from the original crew in the opening credits, taking away from the hopeful suspense of seeing old friends. And were we really supposed to believe that Ferris Bueller's friend would ever get promoted to captain of the Enterprise? While, I'm sure Shatner thought Kirk's heroic death was a fitting end to the character, we were already given a perfect ending for him in the previous film. And Picard's crew really has too much time on its hands to spend so much of it in the Holodeck.*My film rating follows the soccer player rating measure of 6 as a baseline: you did what was expected of you. This film is a 6 because it gave us generic Star Trek intrigue, but lacked the villain and plot to really captivate the audience. The Next Generation crew rose up to the occasion, but were held back by being forced to take the baton from Kirk & Co.",Star Trek - Generations

The scene on the Enterprise B bridge showing kirk coming to terms with the fact that he is no longer the captain of the Enterprise was great but what happened to the cut sky diveing scene of kirk, scotty and chekov from the start of the film. I understand that the studio wanted to start the movie with the Enterprise scene but why has the cut scene not been put on the dvd release as this scene showed us more of the relationship of these three.The picard crew scenes are far to dark apart from the small amount of humor on the holodeck.However the scenes at the end of the movie with kirk and picard are great.Movie would have been better if Paramount had got all of kirks crew to star in the picture and a longer leadup to the Enterprise B scene.",Star Trek - Generations

174,Calis,Still the best Next Gen movie!,10,3 January 1999,"In my humble opinion as a Star Trek fan I think Generations is still the best TNG film to date.  From the opening sequence to the closing scene I think this film moves pretty well.  The score by Dennis McCarthy is a refreshing change from the ever rehashed Jerry Goldsmith scores, also the soundtrack album is a great listen by itself.  The death of Kirk I thought was done very tastefully with no overacting from Shatner and I was sad to see him go as I'm also a big fan of the original Trek movies (including ""V"") and the final ""Oh my"" is heart wrenching. The Enterprise shots were filmed beautifully and it was great seeing the Enterprise on a theatre screen for the first time. I thought the story was great, it was a bit more complex than the series episodes and had more time to develop. The only complaint I have is when Data and Geordi continually state the obvious for the benefit of the non Trek fans and then the dialogue doesn't sound natural. They should take note of The X-files movie, if you don't watch the series, tough, chances are you won't know what's going on. To finish off I find Generations easier to watch over and over again where as First Contact can get very boring after you have watched it twice and I can't comment on Insurrection as I have only seen it once, but I intend to remedy that very soon. Enjoy Generations, it's still the best.",Star Trek - Generations

It was a great send off for the new crew of the Enterprise in the movie industry.  As an avid fan of Star Trek, I would not have been happy had it not been as good as it was.

But I haven't seen a lot of Star Trek movies, so... I liked it.But let's start from the things I didn't like. - The effects look okay today but I think that they sucked when this movie came out, 'couse it looks like a movie that was made in late 70s or early 80s. But the movie was made in 1994. It's kind of like Dark Tower, which was made in last year, but it feels like 10 years old film.One of the plot points of this movie is a story of an android named Data, that tries to understand human emotions. For the most part it's played like comic relief, and even though I liked it at first I realiesed that it's just the same joke saying over and over again. At the beginig the plot was hard to follow, but in the middle it got interresting and I got invested. The finale was a lot of fun, even though the villain sucks. The conversations between captains Picard and Kirk were also well made.Over all. - It's okay.

Soran is a watered-down and less sympathetic version of Sybok and the Nexus ribbon is no different than Sha Ka Ree.  It is also incredible that the long-awaited meeting of the captains was presented in a such a slow-moving, pedestrian vehicle.The story was far from epic, the villain nowhere near as grand as Khan or General Chang, and both captains emerged looking old and feeble.Finally, and most importantly, Captain Kirk should never have been killed off since he IS Star Trek.  I never understood the need for him to pass the torch to Picard, a captain whose series had just went off the air and whose tenure as a Star Trek hero was coming to an end as well.  But even if the producers did feel it was time for Kirk to go, he deserved a far more heroic death than he got.

Well apparently you get a sloppily written film with poorly conceived plot devices and characters that make me wish for deafness. Nothing about the Nexus makes sense, there's no real point to Kirk and Picard to EVER have met except to get some fanboys excited. A villain called Soren wants to go inside the Nexus/Energy ribbon which almost destroyed his ship 78 years prior to the time frame of Star Trek The Next Generation. If his ship was destroyed, he would have gone into it and there would be no movie. However, he was rescued by the Enterprise B and he spends the next 78 years apparently trying to get into the Nexus even though he would have just gone there if his ship was destroyed by it. Instead he initiates a wildly complicated plan to make the Nexus go on a certain course by destroying stars. Why can't he beam into the nexus either? hmm? Even in the vacuum of space you can survive for at least a couple minutes. So basically, the plot makes no sense, the motivations of the villain make no sense and finally it makes no sense why Picard chose Kirk to help him stop Soren instead of anyone younger than 40.

The battle with the enerprise and klingon ship was very cool and dramatic, especially when the ship crashes on the planet.

Two generations of Star Trek fans come together in this film.  Fans of the original series who didn't like The Next Generation had to see it, because Kirk was in it. And fans of the Next Generation who didn't like the original series had to see it, because Picard was in it.  For fans of both, like myself, it was a dream come true.So Data gets emotions, and Troi crashes the ship (not her fault, granted) and Picard and Kirk go horseriding.  It really is a film for the fans. Non-fans needent bother with this one, they wouldn't understand.  The most accessible Trek film was yet to come. (Insurrection).
All in all it's a good film, but it's really one for the fans. And as a fan, i thouroughly enjoyed it.",Star Trek - Generations
183,ronindave,I'll take the 5th over this!,2,23 January 2014,"People used to complain about how bad the 5th Star Trek movie was but I'll take that one any day over this annoying stinker. At least Final Frontier had some funny character moments whereas in the is film the Next Generation crew come off as a bit lifeless with the exception of Picard and Data (which is unfortunate in the latter case).Generations was a pointless picture that did not need to be made. It would be better if they had started the next generation movies with First Contact (and stopped there).The main plot - a bad guy wants to get into a happy magic land that floats around the galaxy like a giant red ribbon in space. In order to accomplish this he shoots rockets into suns in order to change the direction of the ribbon so he can hitch a ride.Who authorized this mess?The Starship Enterprise has to stop him but Captain Picard can't do it alone so he brings in help from the past in the form of legendary Captain James T Kirk. The two captains then proceed to get into a punch-up with Malcolm McDowell and (spoiler!) Kirk dies from a falling bridge. Yep, that's the epic death of Captain Kirk. He doesn't save the whole galaxy by ramming a starship into a doomsday machine or go down fighting blood-crazed Klingons. He falls off a bridge trying to save some planet we never see or heard of before trying to stop a crazy old guy from shooting rockets into suns so he could go to a magical happy land. Dying peacefully in bed would have been better than this ignominy. Added to this fiasco are the painfully not funny scenes with Data and his emotion chip. It was desperately being played up for laughs for the movie-going audience whom the film-makers must have thought of as idiots.I will say I did like the scenes between Kirk and Picard when they were in the magic ribbon (called the Nexus). I just wish those scenes had been in a much better movie than this. Also the beginning of the film with Kirk, Scotty, and Chekov though unnecessary was nice.Overall I cannot recommend this movie unless you like Rifftraxs who do one on this film.",Star Trek - Generations
184,scorpianram,Better than I thought,9,30 May 2003,"I am a Star Trek fan...(DS9 was the best...)Generations is pretty much dissed by Trek fans, but who cares.  I like this movie.  And you know why? Shatner.  I'm not sure how he did it but he steals the show from Patrick Stewart.  Nothing against Mr. Stewart, but in this movie he is just simply...boring.  Shatner brings a child like sense of adventure to Kirk that no other Trek-character can match.I like the 'meeting' of the two great Captains.  Shatner gives him a kick in the butt by saying ""as long as you're in that chair you can make a difference"". I like that.Klingons, Data and a great job by Malcom Mcdowell really make this a fun and 'deep' movie, when compared to the action of First Contact and the boring offerings of Insurrection and the very dreadful Nemesis...I give Generations a 9 on a Trek scale..and a 8 on a general movie scale...",Star Trek - Generations
185,stschlegel,Crown Jewel of Trek.,10,12 September 2018,"A truly exceptional Star Trek film! The ""crown jewel"" of them all, in my opinion. Quite possibly my favorite thing amongst all Star Trek mediums. And I have seen ALL of it. All the movies and every episode of every single series. What I love about this film is the bridging of the gap between two generations of Trek crews and more importantly, their respective captains. It is executed with such love, devotion and attention to detail to the canon, feel and aesthetic of The Original Series motion pictures and The Next Generation TV series. If you're a true fan of classic Trek, there's nothing to dislike here.",Star Trek - Generations
186,trlyons,"Pass the torch, already!",7,20 October 1998,"This transition film, meant to pass the torch from the old Trek cast to the newer ""Next Generation"" one just makes one realize how much we want Shatner to retire from the Captain Kirk role.  What begins as a fairly interesting tale about a ribbon of time/space energy called ""The Nexus"" (which is actually a plane of existence) slowly degrades into another vehicle for Shatner's gigantic ego.  Shatner is featured chopping wood, riding a horse, and generally flexing his aging masculinity.  Were it not for the appealing Next Generation cast and an intriguing sub-plot involving Data's emotion chip, this movie wouldn't be worth seeing at all.  For die hard fans only. Others would be better off skipping it and watching Star Trek: First Contact instead.",Star Trek - Generations

I must say that it has some triteness, but I could say that about 50% of any TNG episode.  Certainly acceptable.In this one, the acting rather than the story sticks with me... Patrick Stewart was particularly good, Brent Spiner deserves a nod, and Shatner delivers.Everyone would have preferred a lot more Kirk... maybe even a Kirk/Picard partnership throughout the whole movie, rather than just part.",Star Trek - Generations

How in heavens name does a rocket supposedly powerful enough to BLOW UP A SUN not wipe out the entire planet, or at least the completely ridiculous metal scaffolding the fight scenes are choreographed on? The answer is really, really poorly thought out plot, adding the biggest of many groan factors in this movie. Fun groans yes, but oh brother so bad!",Star Trek - Generations
190,Shrimpdude,"Brilliant, fun Trek movie!",9,31 October 2007,"Star Trek: Generations is the first of 4 Star Trek movies starring the crew of The Next Generation. It also stars a few familiar faces from the past, such as Scotty, Chekov, and even good ole' Captain Kirk! In my opinion, most of the movie is very enjoyable. It follows a slightly different style than TNG did, but it's defiantely as good. Data finally inserts that emotion chip he got from his creator, but soon encounters problems with it. Dr. Tolian Soran is a great villain, and poses a great threat as many Star Trek enemies do. ProsTense, exciting storyline - Brilliant, extremely tense scene where the Enterprise D is destroyed and the saucer section crashes on a planet's surface - The characters haven't changed a bit! - It's Star Trek! :DConsFor some odd reason, the colours of the character's uniforms keep inverting throughout the movie - The sets have changed slightly, the bridge being most noticeable (the adding of science decks on the port and starboard of the bridge, and stairs just behind the helm) - Kirk doesn't die in the best of ways...but in the long run, he did die honourably. - The story repeats elements of Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country (most notably the scene where the Enterprise D destroys the Klingon Bird of Prey, and Picard getting trapped on the planet then inside the Nexus, like Kirk and McCoy did on Rurapente).Despite the thorns in its' side, it's still an excellent movie and is very much underrated. A must see, not just for Trek fans, but anyone looking for some good sci-fi action!",Star Trek - Generations
191,darqueknight,Star Trek Pseudo-science,5,4 December 2006,"Most of the time it is easy to overlook Star Trek's pseudo-science because, relative to most sci-fi, Star Trek does make some effort to have some theoretical basis. ST usually does not require too big of a suspension of disbelief. However, the part about Dr. Soran wanting to extinguish the star with a ""nuclear inhibitor"" missile was just stupid and somewhat of an insult to the viewers' intelligence. To recap...Soran wanted to extinguish the star so that its gravitational pull would be changed and a particular planet would then be aligned into the path of the nexus.A star's gravitational pull depends on its mass, not on it being a burning ball of gas. Extinguishing the star would preserve its mass, and thus its gravitational pull. All the planets in orbit around it would still maintain their positions.Blowing up the star wouldn't work either, because the planets orbiting it would most likely be destroyed.Dr. Soran was obviously a man of intellect and resources. If he needed to get back to the nexus so bad, why not steal a small ship (like a shuttlecraft) and just fly into it? Oh, but then I guess we would not have had the climatic ""Kirk death scene"" on the planet. But then, I think it would have been more fitting for Kirk to die in space after a fierce battle on a starship, than on some out of the way rock orbiting some forgotten star.",Star Trek - Generations

193,Mr Shagmaster,Can we please call an editor?,4,23 December 1998,"Generations was barely held together by a weak story.  It ranks almost lower than Star Trek V.  The lighting was very annoying and odd.  The movie also needed an editor.  Many sequences went on for too long and others were too short.  Also, when Soran blew up the sun with that missile it only took 2 seconds for the light to go away on the planet.  On earth it takes 8 minutes.  Why does it only take a couple seconds there?  Personally, I am getting tired of the new ST movies based on time.  I thought that Insurrection would get passed that, but it still touched on it.  Oh Well.",Star Trek - Generations
194,Ethel the Frog,Moving and thought-provoking.,8,4 January 2002,"I have only ever really watched the Next Generation series of Star Trek and I am not what you would call a `die hard' fan so I was not at all disappointed that this film sees the final end of Captain Kirk. After all - Shatner's acting is really very hammy and forced, so much so that I found myself cringing every time he opened his mouth. Alongside First Contact, this would have to be my second favourite Star Trek film. McDowell as Dr. Soren is nicely understated though he is given relatively little screen time, and he also manages in this short time to convey a sense of the desperation of a man trying to get back to the utopian land of the Nexus rather than being simply the stereotypical `baddie'. Picard too is given extra range as we see a vulnerable side of him not previously explored. The storyline involving Data and his `emotion chip' is a genuinely interesting and at times very amusing sub-plot and nicely carries on the theme of characters exploring their lives and humanity. The story does at times lurch uncomfortably into sentimentalism, particularly Picard's rather Victorian `utopia', and the conclusion is a bit rushed, however overall the subject is well-handled. This is a very good first movie outing for the Next Generation team, and if you like it you'll probably also like First Contact. 8/10",Star Trek - Generations
195,jamesbrandes,Much Better Film Than I Remembered,9,6 May 2015,"When I originally saw this film in 1994 when I was 13 years old, I was distinctly underwhelmed but having re-watched this for the first time in over 20 years, I appreciate this film a lot more. Even though Star Trek will always work better as a TV Series, this is actually a very good film and I'll explain why below.Originally I wasn't too fussed on the film because I was an avid Trekkie who had loved 'The Undiscovered Country', had been a huge fan of the TNG series and remembered that Scotty said in Relics that ""I'll bet Jim Kirk himself hauled the old gal outta mothballs"" and thus the film had what I considered a major plot hole as a result of Kirk dying. Now that I'm considerably wiser and no longer a virgin/13 years old, this minor plot inconsistency really doesn't matter to me. ;-)Whilst the special effects are a bit rushed/cheap in places (re- using 'The Undiscovered Country' and TV Series effects), it stands up fairly well for a 20+ year old film on a limited budget (particularly compared to the new films). Anyway, special effects can sometimes get in the way of a good script or even negatively affect a film...as they did with 'Into Darkness'.Generations has some stand out moments. I was quite touched by how lonely Picard and Kirk were despite the fact that they had extraordinary lives with excitement and variety that most of us could only dream about. And yet, Picard mourning the death of his family and the family he never had, really touched me...in a way that it didn't 21 years ago. Behind that extremely intelligent and reserved character, was a real, nuanced human being with regrets, dreams and hopes that were never quite realised. When people say this is out of character for Picard, it's obvious that the events in TNG Episode 'The Inner Light' really touched him on a personal level and made him reconsider how important family was. Kirk too, seemed to have heartache in his life and how his decisions/Starfleet ruined any chance of a normal existence. It was sad and compelling to watch and something I never really noticed when I was 13. In fact, the writing by Braga and Moore is very good in the Nexus part whilst the acting by Patrick Stewart and William Shatner made this even more believable/tangible. Moreover, there are humorous elements to the film - Data and the tiny life forms speech made my girlfriend laugh out loud several times - in fact, we watched it 4 times! Thus, it's not all sad. :-) And to me, that's the mark of a good film. Soran, played by Malcolm McDowell, hams it up but is a good character. It was also nice to see Chekov and Scotty one last time. Seeing Kirk, Chekov & Scotty on the bridge and how out of place they were was a nice touch and well-acted. Obviously the rest of the cast probably weren't utilised as much as they should have been but that's only a small negative. Try to watch this with an open mind and maybe you'll appreciate Generations a lot more than you did previously. I know I did. :-)",Star Trek - Generations

In this movie, the baton is clearly passed between captains Kirk and Picard.  Finding a scenario where they could both appear was key, and in this movie that scenario plays out well enough.  The ""Next Generation"" movies that follow this film seem more tied to the past because of this film.  Plus, the movie has humor, decent special effects, and the delightfully villainous Malcolm McDowell.",Star Trek - Generations

I had seen every Original Cast movie (That's Star Trek 1-6), and was ecstatic to see my favorite crew up on the screen. The movie starts with a tragedy that the Original Crew experienced 70 years before the Next Generation, and ends by taking it and clashing it with an approaching disaster which the Next Generation crew needs to stop. It certainly shows the true nature of Kirk and Picard. The phrase: ""Make a difference"" is said often, because that's the moral of the film.But, when the two most legendary captains of all time combine their strengths, their unstoppable... or are they?",Star Trek - Generations
198,gafjonesy-637-36384,Great watch for the saucer crash alone,7,6 January 2021,I recently watched the newer trilogy which gave me an urge to rewatch the originals. They vary in quality of course and the legend that the odd numbered movies in the sequence tend to be the weaker seems to be fair. I do like this one though. Kirk is obviously ancient but at no point are they making him out not to be. Data's emotion chip is an annoying distraction. But the highlight was the saucer crash. It blew me away when I saw it in the cinema and it still holds up pretty well today. If you are a fan of the franchise it is definitely worth a watch.,Star Trek - Generations
199,supafuh,Bad companies,2,15 May 2005,"This movie is a shame! Hollywood at his worst...Paramount wanted to boost Star trek ""the next generation"" so they decided to crossover old and new cast crews without any coherence.If you like to see a legend destroyed, buy this film (you can also buy Mission Impossible with Tom Cruise, another Paramount's sacrifice). In Star Trek, Generations, you'll be able to experience Captain Kirk RIDICULOUS & OUTRAGEOUS death,the absence of Spock (a sage decision to ignore this movie from him), Malcom Mcdowell's mercenary's awful acting and finally a bad scenario...

200,robzilla2001,ever inward,5,21 August 2005,"as a ST movie, I give Generations a 6. Star Trek fans come in 2 types, the ones who like wearing the costumes, and the ones who enjoy the exploration of the human condition thru science fiction. Generations, at it's heart, is a Star Trek movie. Beyond that, however, it is a story about addiction, and how we let ourselves become trapped in our pasts. This subject was explored by ST a bit better in the DS9 pilot episode ('the emissary'), but here it seems the franchise is actually questioning itself. Kirk it seems, must die because brute strength solutions are a thing of the past. So, the irony of going back to the past to punch Soren's lights out are accidentally humorous. Ultimately the message here is If Picard is to learn anything, it's how to rumble. On a musical note, this was one of the better scores for a ST film, the theme for 'the nexus' was hauntingly beautiful.",Star Trek - Generations

Everything works fine with the continuity and I disagree with the reviewers that claims otherwise. I can only agree with a claim related to a destruction of a El-Aurian world by the Borg. It is not possible to get it passed almost unnoticed in the Federation and nobody recognized Borg as a threat. To make the matter worst, 80 years later Starfleet does not know nothing about their existence when Q put Enterprise in front Borg cube.

206,zirclet,'Generations' Revisited,7,2 November 2009,"I was for some reason compelled to put this into the old DVD player last night, and was pleasantly surprised. After 2009's big-budget reboot (which I was duly dazzled and entertained by), this comes off as a think piece/art film in comparison, and a time capsule from a period where 'Star Trek' was everything Gene Roddenberry wanted it to be- cerebral, compassionate, and thoughtful- and people were eating it up by the millions.I recall being thoroughly underwhelmed by this in the late 90's- my younger self, like many others, was expecting a bombastic 'Event' movie- Kirk was meeting Picard, for crying out loud! But instead of a ripping, old-style Star Trek space opera, we got K&P meeting in a log cabin, while Kirk made breakfast, followed by an extended pony ride in which Kirk's character does little but support the story's themes of mortality. And you know what? That's FINE!I recalled Roger Ebert's review of the second 'X-Files' movie, in which he called it refreshing, adding that it was heartening to see a summer franchise film that ""didn't have a villain as big as a building"". 'Generations' doesn't have a villain at all- it has an energy ribbon, and a scientist who desperately wants to harness that ribbon's power after a personal tragedy. What it does have are several indelible sci-fi images (the ribbon approaching Dr. Soran on the mountaintop, the Enterprise-D saucer touching down on a planet's surface) and an abundance of class. This is a gem of a film that now seems to hearken from an era when every genre film didn't have to be shown on a three-storey screen and have 3-D shrapnel flying at the audience throughout.",Star Trek - Generations

It is a classic. Well done.",Star Trek - Generations
208,nightfury37,Good!,6,27 October 2015,"This is my first movie in the Star trek franchise. The story is engaging. The technology they show in a movie made in 1992 is quite astonishing. The CGI work varies from OK to good in various scenes. For example, the way the launcher at the climax, disappearing and reappearing is OK, and the way showed planet Veridian was good. The character importance given to the Android was engaging at the beginning but the way they transformed him into a human, making him cry was not required. It spoiled the essence of his character. Android David from Prometheus was better I felt. The Klingon Commander Worf aboard the Enterprise wasn't given much importance. Since it is my first movie, may be I wanted him to be a part of the action.What I didn't like was, the story was dragged a bit nearing the climax, when Captain Kirk had to change his heart. It was lengthy. What I liked was the main villain of the story, the Nexus. And how Soran was deviating its path towards Veridian.On the whole I enjoyed the movie. May be I will enjoy all the episodes in the franchise.",Star Trek - Generations
209,jonrhys801,Vintage Prestone,6,24 May 2003,"OK, I will admit that I liked this installment of the Never Ending Story. The story plays nicely with the different personal styles of the Enterprise commanders, although Captain Kirk is emotionally much toned down from his television persona. And I will admit to being a big fan of the original television series and not so much of the variants which followed. I really only wanted to state one quibble (ok, two quibbles) with the effects. Once again, sound is made to travel in a vacuum. But this film has put me off drinking. I was horrified, watching as the opening titles rolled, as a vintage bottle of Dom Perignon champaigne slowly revealed itself, flipping end over end before a star-filled backdrop only to realize that the bottle was actually filled with vintage antifreeze as the bottle smashes into the hull of the Enterprise and liquid splatters across the prow of the mighty ship. I guess the wine business won't be what it is today.",Star Trek - Generations
210,Trip-313,The weakest TNG film... possibly the weakest Trek film overall,5,27 June 2011,"Star Trek Generations primary focus was to pass the baton from the original crew to the TNG crew - and it failed miserably. This film not only kills off the most legendary of Starfleet captains in the worst way imaginable, but also suffers from poor writing, disregard of actual facts and inconsistencies between scenes. The director of the film is from ""TV world"" (and it is quite evident with the choppy scenes). The music composer (who had done music for the TNG-era and Enterprise series') basically rehashes all of his TV work in this film for a very forgettable and generic musical score. Well, let's get to it, shall we?The story, in short, is about a mad scientist, Dr. Soran, who wants to get back into the Nexus, a time ribbon flying around in space which fulfills the dreams and desires of those who enter it. Kirk ends up in the Nexus at the start of the film after saving the Enterprise-B. Picard ends up in it with Soran midway through, then Picard leaves with Kirk to stop Soran again.The way Kirk is used in this film is awful. It is pretty much assumed that he was killed just because they wanted to kill him. Although, years later, the writers have regretted that decision and would have let him live. I think it's more bothersome of how/why he dies. Falling off some scaffold to stop a weak villain. Then to top it off, he is buried by getting rocks piled on top of him and there is no mention of him following his death. If they really wanted to kill off Kirk so badly, they could have done it better, with a proper burial, eulogy, etc. Nothing of the sort is made at all, which is a huge disappointment and a slap in the face/big middle finger to the fans.The Nexus is just a huge plot hole and makes no sense when explained. Most Trek phenomenon can be easily dismissed with ""technobabble"" but it just doesn't work here.My first point is Guinan. She was in (and ""ripped away"" from) the Nexus before Kirk or Picard ever enter it. Picard encounters her ""echo"" in the Nexus and the echo seems to know everything about him, even though the echo had never met Picard or even Kirk. How does the echo know all of this? So, theoretically, there should be echoes of Picard, Kirk and Soran still in the Nexus, even though Kirk and Picard left it? Do you need to kill the echo in order to ensure the person is actually deceased? It just brings up to many unanswered and illogical questions.Secondly, I don't see how you can leave the Nexus to any point in time. I'm assuming that with Picard and Kirk leaving to what was a completely destroyed Veridian star system, they essentially created an alternate timeline... or maybe it reset the timeline? It doesn't make any sense. And why go back to a point in time where it's a race against the clock?Lastly, if it can destroy ships, how does it not destroy the natural landscape of Veridian III when it passes through it? Or for that matter, why does it not destroy human flesh? Aye-ca-rumba...Some other odd/bad points in this film to be mentioned: The mismatched uniforms among crew and main characters become a big distraction, especially when Riker has his sleeves rolled up exposing the blue turtle neck, since he was wearing a DS9 cast members uniform that was too big for him.If Soran already had previously built a rocket on Veridian III, then why did he need to torture Geordi for Trilithium information which he never revealed to him? He was going to launch the rocket regardless since he obviously already had built it. Also, the rocket took about 7 seconds to reach the Veridian star, which means the rocket must have reached over warp 9 from initial takeoff. I'm thinking of this in terms of our solar system. Earth is the third planet away from our sun. Veridian III should theoretically be the third planet in the Veridian system. Do you see what I'm getting at? Veridian III is made a faceless planet, giving the audience nothing to care about when it is revealed that the planet (and system) would be destroyed. Imagine if it was Vulcan or even Earth that was going to be destroyed. Would have helped the film out a bit.The whole plasma coils thing after the Klingons match the shield frequency is just plain ridiculous. Why didn't Riker order to change the shield modulation to deflect the shots? It had been done before in episodes on the TV series'.The subplot of Data's emotion chip was highly annoying and detracted from some of the more serious moments in the film, although I believe it was to be a parallel to Picard (like most of the TNG films are).I really find it hard to believe is the opening sequence that the Enterprise-B is the only Federation starship in range within our home solar system. Isn't Earth the Headquarters for the Federation? Aren't there shipyards constructed throughout the solar system? Of course, if another ship went instead, then we wouldn't have had this movie......Wait! Where is the Nexus? I'm going to go back in time and fix this now!!! Generations is definitely the weakest film in the TNG series and I would venture to say the weakest in the first 10 Trek films, hanging off the coattails of Star Trek V. At least Star Trek V had a somewhat clean and consistent storyline.",Star Trek - Generations
211,thestuff,Why?,4,9 February 2002,"The movie had a decent idea.. Merge both generations of the Star Trek Universe for one to pass the torch to the other. However, after watching this, you are going to wish they stopped after The Undiscovered Country.
You get to see part of the original cast (Kirk, Scotty and Chekov) for about 10 or so minutes at the beginning of the movie. The majority of the movie is set in the Next Gen time period, which is fine. There are some decent scenes here, nothing extraordinary, but good.We find Malcom Macdowell as the 'evil' doctor Soran who is trying to get into the Nexus, a place in the universe where time does not exist. To do this, however, he is going to destroy a star in a solar system we know nothing about. A backstory here might have been nice to help build tension, possible inhabitants, etc. None of that. So pretty much, who cares whether or not he does this.
This movie almost seems as though that was the whole point, to kill the hero that has been the figure head of the Star Trek Universe since its creation. There was no climax in the movie, nothing.Do yourself a favor, save your time, money and strength. Skip over this one, you'll be glad you did.",Star Trek - Generations
212,Valeyard-1,Underrated,8,9 February 2002,"On first viewing I, like others, was disappointed. It didn't give what the fans really wanted - the two crews of the Enterprise working together. But when I saw it later on cable it really grew on me. It has good story, good drama, some nice light humour, and the villian is much more interesting than the typical ""take over the universe"" sort. It also had that job v family life theme, as well as the getting older and feeling time over taking you theme that worked so well in past Star Trek movies. Generations is now one of my favourite of the Star Trek movies, second only to Part 4 the Voyage Home.",Star Trek - Generations
213,Davortje,A very bad Star Trek movie.,4,9 February 2014,"This is a very bad Star Trek movie. First because this new crew seems very shallow. In the old movies, all the characters had some unique eccentricness which defined them. One could enjoy them even in a plot less movie like when drifting aimlessly in space. But after seeing this movie I can hardly define anyone: they are all the same. Only Data with his emo-chip seemed to have something going on.Second is the plot. The plot is reasonable: some guy that wants something ""bad"". There is some ""philosophical"" message behind it, like ""time gives meaning to our actions"". The old movies had such messages too. But the problem with this movie, and the main reason why I sack it, is because the plot is so ill-conceived. Towards the end, it actually is opposing its message. The two protagonists are fighting zealously, but even if they lose, they will be able to come again and try to thwart Soran's plans once more. So who cares whether they succeed or not this time Not to mention the holes that time travel introduces. It is inherent to unconditioned time travel to devoid actions and choices of meaning because they can be redone. And this movie is full of such meaningless moments.And all this while the first 20 minutes were pretty well done but in the end a disappointing Start Trek movie. 4/10",Star Trek - Generations
214,jm4n,Great transitional movie,9,26 January 2005,"Being the last Star Trek feature-film with (some of) the original cast, I've always thought of this film as a good ""transitional"" film into The Next Generation. Kirk (Shatner) gets one last great performance in the story, and Picard (Stewart) gets to show a more dramatic side than is usually apparent in the series.Many humorous moments (like most Star Trek movies) appear, especially in the first scenes as Kirk is made to feel old (the captain of the new Enterprise mentions having read about Kirk in history books); and, of course, unexpected events occur on an unprepared ship with a minimal crew.The Next Generation cast performed quite well; Commander Data (Brent Spiner) got to go outside the usual ""Data"" role; Spiner's performance was exceptional in this particular film; this film helps one to appreciate how difficult the Data character must be to perform; playing a non-human character can at times be much more difficult than a human character -- at least for a human actor...All in all, a great story line, and a great transition for original Star Trek fans to get a feel for the Next Generation crew, how it all fits together in the time-line. Simply put, it's a great ending to the original cast's adventures and a great introduction to the Next Generation cast; seeing the two captains work together helps one to transition without feeling like something is lost (no need for debating who was better; they worked in different times, different circumstances).",Star Trek - Generations
215,Madaracs,Star Trek: Generations,5,2 November 1999,"The plot lacks any cohesion whatsoever.  Each time I watched this film it seemed to get worse.  Nexus is the name of hair products not a ""ribbon that swallows people in space.""  Kirk is not dead.  You do not kill heroes. (Not that everyone loves Kirk, but he didn't need to be killed.)  It just looked like the staff of Generations was a little full of themselves and not good ideas.",Star Trek - Generations
216,88merlin88,A painful experience.,2,18 January 2002,"Generations was a mistake from the start.  Without giving an in depth review, let us just say, it was bad.  Really bad.  Of all the Star Trek DVDs I own, this is the only missing from my collection - and I'm not sorry. Do yourself a favor and miss this one.",Star Trek - Generations
217,aghiutza,Maybe too fan-oriented,8,24 December 2001,"I've read countless different views on ST: Generations and i've come to believe that it mostly appealed to Star Trek fans rather than the general audience, in particular to those fond of The Next Generation tv series. As I consider myself a fan, i couldn't be more happy with the way the TNG crew debuted on the big screen. For me it's less of a ""consumer"" oriented movie and more of an insight into the relations of the TNG crew.From the very beginning i could tell it was going to be a very emotional movie. And indeed, there were quite a few moments that touched my heart: Kirk's apparent death, Picard talking to Troi about his nephew's death, Data's funny, yet touching, babble, the image of the captain's home at Christmas, but also the moments of confrontation between Picard and Dr. Soren. I particularly liked the first time they meet in ten forward, when Soren grabs Picard and looks him straight in the eye. The psychologic tension is unbelievable and i can truly say that Patrick Stewart and Malcolm McDowell are explosive as hero vs villain.The story holds up pretty well, with minor exceptions, probably noted only by the hardcore trekkers (the big question was ""Why didn't Riker remodulate the shields frequency when he saw the klingons were shooting straight through them?""). Otherwise it manages to keep you watching, has some nice twists and ties-up some loose ends too. The cast do their parts pretty well, with Stewart, McDowell and Spiner standing out.David Carson does a fine job in giving an overall more ominous feel to the ship as in the series. The yellow lighting works well and the modified interiors are also good. Still, i didn't understand why the footage of the exploding klingon ship had to be reused from ST VI (and not only). That kinda took away the joy of the moment for me.All in all a good movie, not quite up to First Contact, but still a must see for any Star Trek fan and maybe not much so for one not acquainted with the Star Trek universe. 8 out of 10",Star Trek - Generations
218,sanchez-omar,Great Kirk!,8,2 February 2012,"I always loved this movie. From the very first time I saw it, at the age of 10, I absolutely adored it. It took a big risk, admittedly, in bringing the Original Series and TNG together, but I believe it did it extremely well and with a lot of ingenuity.The first part of the movie seems to pick up where ""The Undiscovered Country"" left off; and it does so on a somewhat sour note. Retirement does not sit at all well with Captain Kirk, and he hates the idea of being a ""legend"" and having the namesake of his beloved ship run by a bunch of inexperienced kids and a skeleton crew (the running ""tuesday"" gag is hilarious). I think Walter Koenig and James Doohan were marvellous in the first part of this movie, and the scene where they arrive on deck 15 and find themselves staring into the void of space is chilling.After this, it picks up with the Next Generation Crew, and boy, does the camera love the Enterprise D. It's emotional to see the crew going through the changes this movie throws at them, and by the time Geordi's kidnapped and Data's emotions are uncontrollable, my heart was in my throat.It's also a pleasure to see Whoopi Goldberg reprise her role as Guinan, and as far as humor goes, Data's newfound sense of humor had me on the floor.I LOVED Picard and Kirk's interactions and the segment in Kirk's cabin is an absolute hoot. (Picard: ""This is not your bedroom."") Soran is a great villain, truly ruthless and threatening. Out of all the Next Gen films, this is probably my favorite. It has an atmosphere about it that's very appealing to me, and the only other TNG film that had the same feeling was Nemesis, which I still maintain was a DAMN good movie.",Star Trek - Generations
219,SimonZebo1990,Watch Another,4,14 October 2015,"Probably one of the worst Star Trek movies. That's coming from someone whose a huge fan of the movies and TV shows. Star Trek: Generations is to the original crew films as to what Star Wars: The Phantom Menace is to the original Star Wars trilogy. Malcom McDowell is wasted. He's an excellent actor otherwise, just his talents are put to waste in this movie. None of the characters exude the kind of character that you would normal expect. The movie looks very low budget. Most scenes look like a kid with a camera and a cheap toy could of done the same thing. I would only see this just because it is part of the Star Trek series. There is only one decent film featuring the Next Generation cast, and that is ""First Contact"". If you want to see a film worthy of the Next Generation TV show, watch that film, and ignore all others.",Star Trek - Generations
220,SZarich0822,My thoughts on this Star Trek Movie,7,6 March 2006,"Overall, Star Trek Generations was a good movie. The action was good, it had a plausible plot, and the acting was good. One aspect that I did not care for was Data's emotion chip. In the series, it was great that he could never have emotion, and he desired to be so human, but knew that he could never be. The emotion chip was brought on the series, but circumstances always delayed Data's opportunity to use it. When he finally does, it stinks. He provides some comedic relief in the film, but really, the whole emotion chip story should not have even been brought into it. Another problem of course is that the Enterprise D was destroyed. Seven years of falling in love with that ship and it is destroyed. I think that was a big mistake by the writers. The Enterprise-D was awesome, and destroying it was just not good for the whole Next-Gen series of movies anyways. I mean the Enterprise E that is brought into the next 3 movies, we hardly get to know. As an audience, we had 7 years to get acquainted with the intricacies of that ship, and they blew it up. Being a great fan of the franchise, I really hated that. Of course I have to mention the death of Captain Kirk. I think no one could be more upset than I was. I was 10 years old, sitting in the theater, and watched him die. I cried for days knowing that my hero was dead. He was given very little time on the screen and really made it an over glorified death. I think they should have left him and the entire original cast alone after the 6th movie. It was fine to see them all retire and ride off to the stars, that was a perfect ending for their 25 years of Star Trek. Generations would have been fine without the Kirk element. We all knew that the movie was going to be Next-Gen, and Next Generation had a huge fan base at the time, the series had been nominated for best drama in its seventh season, which was the same year this movie came out. I think everyone knew that The Next Generation was in its prime and didn't need the Original Cast to help them out or even pass the torch, it was already done. The Next Generation had its own fan base, both from the original series and just brand new. However, this movie was a good movie, just that it could have been much better without the presence of original series characters, and the Enterprise D did not have to be destroyed.",Star Trek - Generations
