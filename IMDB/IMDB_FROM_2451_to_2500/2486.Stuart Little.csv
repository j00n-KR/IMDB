0,TheLittleSongbird,Sweet and memorable movie.,8,14 May 2009,"This movie is really sweet, and I enjoyed it enormously. Sometimes it is a bit overly sentimental, and the human characters aren't as charming as the animal characters. Jonathan Lipnicki was sweet as George, but doesn't quite have the charm he brought to the The Little Vampire. Geena Davis and Hugh Laurie do amiably as the parents, but both seem subdued. Luckily, the human characters don't interfere too much with the animals, and still bring a certain charm to the screen. Stuart is wonderfully voiced by Michael J.Fox, and he joined by a hilarious Nathan Lane as Snowbell and a villainous Chazz Palminteri as Smoky. The script is intelligent and sweet, and there are plenty of charming scenes with Stuart and George. All in all, really sweet, fun and memorable. 8/10 Bethany Cox.",Stuart Little
1,Leofwine_draca,Take it or leave it,4,18 September 2021,"One I saw at the cinema. To say I'm a little too old for the target audience is an understatement. On the plus side, the CGI is perfectly serviceable for the kind of film this is, and Fox is a good choice for the voice over. The rest is a typical Hollywood kid's film, take it or leave it.",Stuart Little
2,SnoopyStyle,fine family fare,7,10 November 2013,"Mr. Little (Hugh Laurie) and Mrs. Little (Geena Davis) is looking to adopt for a younger brother for George (Jonathan Lipnicki). When they get to the orphanage, they become enamored with a little white mouse Stuart (Michael J. Fox). The family cat Snowbell (Nathan Lane) is frustrated that he isn't allowed to eat Stuart, and George is unhappy with a mouse as a brother.This is fine lighthearted family movie. The CG mouse fits very well with the live action. It's a nice charming fare, and I love how everybody accepts a talking mouse as an everyday thing. It gives it a whimsical feel. I love that Snowbell is more scared from being laughed at by fellow cats and not so much making Stuart as a simple meal.And there is a deeper message about adoption if you want to take it that far. And I love the affection George and Stuart grow to have. It is a great entertaining children's movie.",Stuart Little
3,jboothmillard,Stuart Little,5,21 September 2005,"Based on the popular children's book by Charlotte's Web writer E.B. White comes the film adaption of the weird new member of a family. Basically Mr. Fredrick (Hugh Laurie) and Mrs. Eleanor Little (Geena Davis) are going to the children's home to adopt a new ""little"" brother for themselves and their son George (Jerry Maguire's Jonathan Lipnicki). what they actually get is a little brother, they get a mouse named Stuart (Michael J. Fox). At first George thinks they are joking because he is a mouse, but after a little while he gets used to him. Even the family cat Snowbell, or 'Snow' (Nathan Lane) has to get used to him. Obviously as you'd expect, Stuart has many small adventures during the film. Also starring Jennifer Tilly as Mrs. Camille Stout and Jeffrey Jones as Uncle Crenshaw Little. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Visual Effects. It was number 100 on The 100 Greatest Family Films. Worth watching!",Stuart Little
4,ccthemovieman-1,"Colorful, Charming, Nice Story Most People Should Like",8,16 August 2006,"Wow, there are lots of name actors are either in front of the camera or being used as voices in this unique animated-real life film. They use real people and animals (except for fake mouths when the animals ""talk"") and an animated mouse (Stuart, voiced by animation favorite Michael J. Fox.) who looks incredibly life-like.The colors in this movie are terrific, especially with the house that the Little family lives in. The story has some clever stuff in it but it strictly played for laughs and reactions since credibility is about zero in many parts of this story. However, it's supposed to be outrageous. I don't think Geena Davis has ever played a nicer role than this. It was good to see. The husband was just as nice, played affably by Hugh Laurie.The jokes are good for the kids and adults. I know a couple of parents who liked this movie even better than their kids, so don't believe it when someone writes that this is a film strictly for kids. That is not so. I did object to some profanity in here at the end, which seemed so out of place, but it's hard to expect Hollywood to get everything right. The sequel to this film is even better!",Stuart Little
5,michaelRokeefe,Just not normal is it?,4,24 March 2009,"At least the under ten year old set will stay interested. Eleanor(Geena Davis)and Fred(Hugh Laurie)Little, a nice well-to-do couple set out to bring home from the orphanage a new little brother for their son George(Johnathan Lipnicki). They come home with quite the odd new sibling...a sharp dressed little mouse named Stuart(voiced by Michael J. Fox). Yes, mouse. Stuart is happy to have found the sense of belonging even if it is in a super sized world that contains his new family's pet cat Snowbell(voiced by Nathan Lane). Stuart embarks on the experience of family loyalty and overall friendship. George will finally accept his tiny new brother when the dapper dressed Stuart saves embarrassment at a model boat race.Also in the cast: Julia Sweeney, Harold Gould, Estelle Getty and Jeffery Jones.

6,studioAT,"Little mouse, big film",6,18 May 2013,Stuart Little is a great example of a film for all the family and takes the original best loved book by EB White and makes it a vivid and heart felt film.The story is simple but that's the beauty of this film. If you are prepared to suspend your disbelief a few times then you'll find this a funny film.Hugh Laurie tries out the American accent that would later make his fortune in the hit show House while Michael J Fox is a perfect choice as the voice of the title character.One of my favourite films growing up and no doubt this will be the case with children for many years to come.,Stuart Little
7,Calicodreamin,Little hey little ho,6,11 July 2021,"As a kid I loved this movie, as an adult I'm like wtf. So I guess I should say it works as a kids movie; good animation and a easily followable storyline. As far as deep diving into the concept, it's way past strange. Decent acting.",Stuart Little
8,view_and_review,You Could Have Worse Siblings,6,20 December 2020,"I, for one, don't know how I'd react to my parents bringing home a mouse and telling me it's my brother, but I certainly don't mind watching a kids movie about it.Stuart (voiced by Michael J. Fox) was adopted by the Littles (Hugh Laurie and Geena Davis). George Little (Johnathan Lipnicki), their son, had the reaction any normal person would have: rejection. ""That's not my brother, that's a mouse."" Even the household pet Snowbell (Nathan Lane) rejected the idea. In short time Stuart won George over and the four were a small happy family. Except Snowbell still hadn't warmed up to the idea of being a pet to a mouse.""Stuart Little"" was a cute movie. This would be perfect for all ages except for the use of ""hell"" and ""damn"" once each. I don't usually police such language, but my kids were watching so it stuck out to me. It was still very decent overall and very kid friendly.",Stuart Little
9,anaconda-40658,Idiotic Adoption.,1,4 March 2016,"Stuart Little (1999): Dir: Rob Minkoff / Voice: Michael J. Fox / Cast: Hugh Laurie, Geena Davis, Jonathan Lipnicki, Julia Sweeney: A great computer generated mouse placed within a screenplay that bares no plot. Stuart is the darling mouse whose last name reflects that he is indeed small. One wonders what intelligence came up with that. He is adopted by Hugh Laurie and Geena Davis. He goes home to obvious problems. The boy of the house doesn't accept him at first but will eventually. The cat tries to tries to dine on him. He even gets caught in the washing machine. Eventually two mice arrive poising as Stuart's parents and the manic struggle to get home and avoid cats. While computer generated characters are dazzling the story is formula. Director Rob Minkoff fails to provide a back story to Stuart's existence. He had much better success with The Lion King. Michael J. Fox voices Stuart whose origins are not given therefore he isn't that interesting. Laurie and Davis react as if adopting a mouse in a three piece suit is normal, and Jonathan Lipnicki as the boy is a mere prop. This is the film's biggest flaw because it fails to translate the idiotic behavior. This film should be tossed to a box full of mouse traps for an entertaining final verdict. It is a family film out to sell computer generated creation with a screenplay that does as little as possible. Score: 1 / 10",Stuart Little
10,StevePulaski,Not just a mouse - a brother,8,29 September 2012,"The ""Little"" family is the gentlest, most genial movie family in recent memory. They live in a quiet house amidst the hustle and bustle of New York City life. They are the straight-shooter Frederick (Hugh Laurie), understanding Eleanor (Geena Davis), and spunky tike George (Johnathan Lipnicki), who is excited as can be the day his parents set out to adopt a new member of the family. They go in hoping to walk out with a younger sibling, but walk out with a whole other creature. Literally.They adopt Stuart, a precocious, easily lovable mouse with the cutest smile you'll ever see, the most impeccably charming voice (thanks to Michael J. Fox), and the most adorable little clothes this side of Barbie and Ken. When the Little's take him into their home, they find ""difficulties"" plaguing them from the start. George is a tad underwhelmed when he finds out his new brother is a five inch rodent and the house cat isn't happy that his master also serves as lunch. The cat is Snowbell (voiced by Nathan Lane) and he develops a plan to get back at Stuart for coming into his house, allegedly trying to take over his home.But how you could hate Stuart? One look in those eyes and you melt under the weight of his cuteness. Rob Minkoff's (co-director of Disney's The Lion King) Stuart Little pays careful attention to little background details and cinematography, but refuses to shortchange the people in the story. The screenplay, written by Greg Booker and the unlikely M. Night Shyamalan is sensitive to the idea of sibling adoption and never seems to exploit this idea or turn it into a laugh riot. E.B. White's original story sort of muted the concept, while its film counterpart puts more of an emphasis on this event.There's a wide array of side-character voices you're likely to pick up on. David Alan Grier, Chazz Palminteri, and Steve Zahn are among them, as well as cameos by Estelle Getty, Harold Gould, and Julia Sweeney. All the characters are portrayed under a wonderfully positive light, but the writing doesn't hesitate to take a dark turn and punctuate some rather depressing sequences within its delectably sweet interior. There's a word for films like Stuart Little and that word is ""jolly."" This is a completely acceptable and wonderfully told spin on the ""new brother"" formula.Starring: Geena Davis, Hugh Laurie, and Jonathan Lipnicki. Voiced by: Michael J. Fox, David Alan Grier, Nathan Lane, Chazz Palminteri, and Steve Zahn. Directed by: Ryan Minkoff.",Stuart Little
11,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Little hi, little low...",5,4 October 2021,"'Stuart Little (1999)' is a very slight adventure, though it does have its 'larger' moments. It doesn't really do all that much with its high-concept premise, nor does it deliver on the analogy it initially seems to be setting up. As such, it's basically just a basic family drama except one of its members is a mouse. The film has its own subtle charm to it and it, essentially, does exactly what it needs to. However, outside of its few set-pieces, it's quite a passive viewing experience. Its emotional core is decent enough but it isn't massively affecting. Basically, the whole thing is just alright. It isn't bad, but it isn't particularly good, either. There's not all that much else to say, really. 6/10.",Stuart Little
12,g-bodyl,Mediocre!,6,9 January 2011,Stuart Little is just a mediocre movie about a mouse based on the beloved classic novel written by E.B White. I seen this film about four times over the past ten years but my views on it didn't change. I don't think this movie does the book justice. There were some great moments but the rest were just plain mediocre.This movie plot is simple. It's about a family with a young son who decides to adopt a pet mouse.The acting is okay. Hugh Laurie impressed me like he always does especially in his role on House. Michael J. Fox did a decent voice over as Stuart.I think little kids will like this the most. I'm not so sure about adults. I rate this film 6/10.,Stuart Little

15,briancham1994,Lovable story,8,20 August 2020,"This film features the lovable Stuart Little, played very appropriately by Michael J. Fox. The interactions between him and the other characters are convincing and we easily forget that he is animated. The story is funny and heartwarming.",Stuart Little
16,damianphelps,Nice,6,29 September 2020,Nice is the best way I can describe this movie.The story is charming and well delivered and the cast are a good fit.The story is owned by Michael J.

17,lisafordeay,Cute for kids for the adults not really only if your a kid at heart like me.,6,15 June 2013,"I saw this on TV and in the cinemas when I was 9 years old at the time,im now 22)and I found it really cute and adorable. The story centers on a dotting couple played by Genna Davis and Hugh Laurie who wants to adopt another child for their youngest child played by Johnathan Lippiki(from Jerry Maguire)as they don't want him to be a only child. So the woman from the adoption center finds the perfect candidate for them,but the problem is that the child isn't a human in fact his a MOUSE!!?! but his parents died along time ago and he wants somebody to adopt him. So since the dotting couple love him they decide to keep him(OK this is kinda of ridiculous adopting a mouse but hey its a children's flick just go with the flow on it). They do of course plan a special event for Stuart(that's what they called him voiced by Micheal J Fox) and have all his relations over little do they know that his a mouse and that Mr and Mrs Little's cat Snowball(voiced by Nathan Lane from The Lion King)doesn't like Stuart at all and wants to get rid of him by having mice pretend to be Stuart's REAL parents.Yeah yeah its kinda silly and a tad bit stupid but I liked this movie as a kid,today whenever its on TV I still watch it but if you've got kids around the house that likes a bit of fantasy then check it out.Again a 6 out of 10 like the sequel.",Stuart Little
18,dfranzen70,Mouse with Pet Cat Saves Day,7,22 April 2000,"If you told me five years ago that I'd be watching a movie about a mouse who is adopted by humans, I'd probably ask you what kind of drugs you were taking and how many would I need to take to enjoy such puerile piffle. But five years ago we didn't have the kind of technical wizardry we have now; witness Toy Story, the new Star Wars, or any of the recent Disney films. Five years ago, the mouse would have been a regular rodent with a not-too-subtle voiceover. Remember Homeward Bound, the movie about the two dogs and the cat? There was no computer animation there, and you were basically left with three animals who appeared to cavort onscreen while some humans talked in the background. So now here we have Stuart Little, a tiny little mouse (voiced by the always-fresh Michael J. Fox) who has lived his entire life in an orphanage. One day, the Littles (Hugh Laurie and Geena Davis) come to the orphanage looking for a brother for their young son George (Jonathan Lipnicki). Of course, with so many cute little boys and girls, it's impossible to choose - until they come across Stuart, who seems smart, funny, and wise beyond his years. George isn't too fond of Stuart at the start - he expected something a little... um, taller - but this is a kids' movie, after all, so eventually they bond as only a boy and his mouse brother can - by winning a boat race against a nasty bully.There are a few storylines jammed into this 85-minute extravaganza. Stuart wants to learn about his natural parents, the family cat wants to kill him, and the parents want Stuart and George to get along. The way most of it plays out will come off as standard movie fare - predictable to those of us over 10, perhaps - but the winning charm of Fox as the loveable Stuart coupled with an engaging and appealing cast of characters makes up for any familiarity you might feel. On top of it all - the special effects. Now, I'm not one to heap overweening praise on special effects, but at no point during the viewing of this movie did I consider Stuart (or the cat, voiced by Nathan Lane) to be an artificial computer creation. Sure, you have to suspend belief a little bit for this movie, but hey - don't you have to do that with almost any movie, anyway?",Stuart Little
19,kevin_robbins,this is a very average movie that is worth seeing as a family once,5,21 August 2021,"Stuart Little (1999) is a movie I recently watched on HBOMax with my daughter. The storyline follows the Little family that has a little boy and wants to adopt a brother to go along with their son. When they head to the orphanage the Little's fall in love with a little mouse named Stuart. As Stuart returns home with the Little parents there will be an adjustment period for the new brothers to get on the same page. This movie is directed by Rob Minkoff (The Lion King) and stars Michael J. Fox (Back to the Future), Geena Davis (Long Kiss Goodnight), Hugh Laurie (House), David Alan Grier (Boomerang) and Jennifer Tilly (Bride of Chucky). The cast and voices are very well selected in this. The animation and action sequences are also entertaining and fairly good. The story is fairly average but there's some good messages and an worthwhile conclusion. Overall this is a very average movie that is worth seeing as a family once.",Stuart Little
20,Catherine_Grace_Zeh,Excellent film adaptation of E.B. White's novel,10,19 January 2006,"STUART LITTLE, in my opinion, is an excellent film adaptation of E.B. White's novel. One of the things I liked most about it were the performances of Hugh Laurie, Geena Davis, and Jonathan Lipnicki as the family members. If you ask me, it was funny when George (Jonathan Lipnicki) outsmarted that smart-mouthed Anton (Miles Marsico). If you want to know what he did, you'll have to see the movie. Also, I though that everyone's performances were top-notch, the casting was terrific, and the scenery was beautiful. Oh, and I also loved the music, especially Lyle Lovett's ""Walking Tall."" In conclusion, I highly recommend this well-done live-action film adaptation of E.B. White's novel to all you Michael J. Fox or Geena Davis fans who have not seen it.",Stuart Little
21,ShootingShark,"Sweet-Natured, Well-Crafted, Municipal Mouse Movie",6,21 August 2005,"The Littles, a very nice family, adopt a mouse called Stuart as their son, but he has trouble fitting in because he's not human and the family cat doesn't like him. Things are looking up after Stuart wins a miniature boat race in Central Park, but then the neighbourhood cats hatch a plot to get rid of him ...This is a very charming Little movie, based on a book by E.B. White, with a wonderful subtext about looking beyond differences in each other. The cast, both physical and voice-only, embrace the material with relish. Davis & Laurie make for a wonderful oddball couple, Polito has a hilarious bit as a trenchcoated copper and Palminteri is terrifically sinister as the voice of a tough alleycat. The special effects for Stuart and the cats by John Dykstra are great, as is the score by Alan Silvestri, and the film has a wonderful modern-day fairy-tale look through clever use of design, wardrobe and matte work. My only gripe is, like the Littles, this film is maybe just a bit too nice, (despite being co-scripted by the very spooky M. Night Shyamalan); I would have liked a few less schmaltzy scenes and a few more scary ones. Nevertheless this is a lovely, funny, extremely entertaining adventure for everyone.",Stuart Little
22,rbverhoef,"Nice film, great mouse",7,7 January 2003,"Stuart Little is a mouse, adopted by a family of human beings. Geena Davis is the mother, Hugh Laurie is the father and the son is that nice little guy from Jerry Maguire. He wants a little brother, Stuart is smaller and so he is a Little brother. The family has a cat, Snowbell. He is jealous because in a way he is the house cat of a mouse. Stuart is treated just as a human being, which sometimes is a little strange, but it has its own charm. The little Stuart Little in a big human-sized bed, but his own little sports car driving through Central Park. It doesn't make much sense, but it is nice to watch. The story is pretty predictable, but most family films are.The creation of Stuart is wonderful, he looks great and you start to believe he is a real mouse, adopted by caring parents. The voices are also great. Michael J. Fox as Stuart and Nathan Lane as Snowbell especially are very nice. If you just like a nice film, with a fantastic computer generated mouse and a happy ending, this one will not disappoint you.",Stuart Little
23,Movie-ManDan,Cute and Enjoyable For The Whole Family.,7,5 May 2021,"Sadly, I have never read the original book by EB White that ""Stuart Little"" is based upon. But it isn't that hard to see that the movie falls inferior. But I disagree when people trash this movie. That sort of criticism is too harsh.Frederick and Eleanor Little head off to the New York orphanage to adopt a new child. Their biological son, George (Jonathan Lipniki from ""Jerry Maguire""), is so excited to be getting a younger brother. They meet a three-inch-tall humanoid mouse named Stuart (voiced by Michael J. Fox) and they really hit it off. The adoption is finalized with Stuart becoming a Little. But George can't see past his new brother's height. But that doesn't last very long and they start to bond like young brothers do.The Littles love Stuart and consider him to be an actual family member. These tender and fuzzy moments of the family loving Stuart and George eventually loving his new brother are quite good.The only one that hates Stuart and does not seem to develop any soft spot towards him is the Littles' cat, Snowbell (voiced by Nathan Lane). He is so jealous that this tiny mouse is getting a humane treatment while he gets treated like a regular cat. But he is even more scared about his cat friends in the neighborhood finding out and embarrassing him. When the other cats find out, they decide to help Snowbell destroy his arch rival.This is the aspect with the villains and the problems that must be resolved. Again, it's nice.Not a fan of everything presented? Well the one thing that everyone can agree on is the innovative special effects. Stuart himself is obviously non-existent (I will be surprised if there were scenes where he was animatronic) but he looks so real and adorable. Snowbell the cat and all his cat friends talking so look real too. Animatronics must have been used for the cats and they look superb.""Stuart Little"" is not a masterful film like ""Babe."" It fails at giving a supremely powerful vision of what it means to be family. The flaws here and there aren't bad, the whole thing simply wasn't strong. But I really don't want to downgrade everything. Just because it isn't powerful, doesn't mean it is not good. This IS good! Just because it isn't a masterpiece, doesn't mean this isn't something to skip. See this.3/4.",Stuart Little
24,Howlin Wolf,"Engaging family flick in the mould of ""Toy Story"" and its sequel.",7,24 October 2001,"""Stuart Little"" is a film that is fairly obviously designed to appeal primarily to children; but at the same time its knowing but never vulgar humour stops it from becoming saccharine.  The human performers in the movie are forced to play second fiddle to their animatronic co-stars, and it's just as well, because every one of them is bland and uninteresting, two things that the 'animals' on show here are not.  As Stuart, Fox injects the same charm and vulnerability into the mouse that he's done for characters in his other family outings.  None of the other characters can hold a candle to Stuart, the little guy's just so darn cute... !   It's formulaic all the way, and it never offers anything more than just shallow entertainment, but what'd'you expect from a kids movie?  For those people who can't live with the idea of a talking mouse who the adults treat as 'normal', use your imagination!  Isn't acceptance a far better thing to be preaching to children than shock over someone who is different?   A winsome little film that probably only a curmudgeon could fail to take to heart, ""Stuart Little"" is good, solid entertainment for everybody, without being unmissable.  I thank the Lord for this and the Toy Story pair for removing the Teletubbies, Barney and Bob the Builder from our TV at home whenever my little sister wants to watch something...",Stuart Little
25,areatw,Childhood classic that will never lose its charm,7,16 April 2017,"I must have seen this film about a dozen times, and I seem to enjoy it more and more with every viewing. It was one of my favourites growing up as a kid and the fact it's on TV practically every week says a lot about how popular it remains, even 18 years after its release. 'Stuart Little' is certainly a crowd-pleaser and a film that can be enjoyed by people of all ages and not just the younger viewers it is targeted at. The cast are all great and Michael J Fox does an excellent job voicing Stuart. 'Stuart Little' is a film that never loses its charm, no matter how many times you see it.",Stuart Little
26,TheUnknown837-1,great family film with a good heart,7,9 June 2008,"Both ""Stuart Little"" and its first sequel, titled ""Stuart Little 2"" are two nice little family films that I recommend for their effective blend of drama, adult humor that never goes out of hand, controlled suspense and violence as well as language, and yet it never gets so immature as to become only for the kids. Some critics thought that the movie might have had some moments too intense or unsuited for young children. I was eight years old when I first saw this film and it never bothered me. I was surprised to find swearing in this film, but again, it didn't degrade the film because it was sparingly used and by that I mean it was only used once or twice.The character of Stuart is very effectively brought onto the screen. The mouse is entirely computer-generated in an efficient way and the contributions of Michael J. Fox's voice work out very well. The same goes for the other animated characters. All of the live-action performances were well-done and they blended in perfectly with the CGI characters.""Stuart Little"" has a good heart and it is can be a very warm little family movie for everybody to enjoy. I still enjoy it nine years after I first saw the film and I do recommend it. It's a film that will suit audience members of all ages. As long as you enjoy family films.",Stuart Little

28,jeremycrimsonfox,A Neat Film For All Ages,9,19 March 2019,"Stuart Little is one of those films from my childhood I still hold dear in my memories. A loose adaptation of the 1945 book of the same name, the film is a neat example. The story is sweet, as it is about Stuart going on misadventures. Yeah, the plot does jump around, but it does give a good variety, and I am shocked M. Night Shyamalan was one of the screenplay's writers.The acting is nice. Geena Davis does a good job as Mrs. Little, and Hugh Laurie, who played Jasper in the live action 101 Dalmations film, is good as Mr. Little. But the real stars are the voice actors, like the main two, Michael J. Fox and Nathan Lane, who voice Stuart and Snowbell. They make a good team acting out a mouse who is treated as a family member and a cat who is embarrassed about being owned by a mouse. It adds some great dynamic. Also, the music is one of the most memorable in movie history.It does have some scary moments (mainly during the boat race, and near the end, where Stuart is being chased by cats led by Smokey), but it is a great movie with a great story and great acting that proves that a family is a family, no matter how different a member is.",Stuart Little
29,mattymatt4ever,Lightweight but fun,7,22 April 2001,"""Stuart Little"" goes through the predictable motions of a cute little family fantasy.  But the premise is quite original, inspired by E.B. White's book. And it works, gently persuading you to suspend disbelief in each preposterous situation.  Sure, this movie makes very little sense, but it's a family film.  And it does cater to the young ones perfectly.  However, the older folks aren't left to dry either.This fantasy is full of unique, imaginative characters.  The one I liked best was the tough-as-nails alley-cat, voice provided by the great Chazz Palminteri.  It's nice how he spoofs his usual typecasted persona in a family-oriented, feline fashion.  So there's one inside joke for the adults to chuckle at.  Also, Stuart's--alleged--birth parents, voices provided by Jennifer Tilly and Bruno Kirby.  Bruno has some very funny lines.  And there are many other characters who blurt out funny, imaginative, quoteable lines that adults will cherish.The only stiffs in this story are the humans.  Geena Davis and Hugh Laurie are shifted into Cleaver-mode.  Their character traits consist of smiling, nodding, apologizing and consoling.  Luckily, the animals are the stars and they make up for everything.  This is not the best family film ever made, but it's good one and it's more than bearable for adults.  Naturally, kids will laugh and cheer--that isn't exactly a difficult task.    My score:  7 (out of 10)",Stuart Little

31,Beta_Gallinger,"Nothing too mind-blowing, but a family adventure with a number of satisfying aspects",6,31 October 2010,"The first time I saw this was on video in June 2000, late in my first year as a teenager. It had been about six months since the theatrical release of ""Stuart Little"", and I was shown the film on the last day of school before summer holidays. I can't remember exactly what I thought of it at the time, but remember it did hold my attention for a memorable first viewing. I wouldn't be seeing it again until about ten years and four months later, but that has finally happened. I didn't know anything about the film's reputation when I first saw it, but by the time I finally watched it again, I had looked it up. I could tell that it wasn't one of the most popular family films from recent decades but wasn't generally despised, so I wasn't surprised when I found it to be a mixed blessing.George is the only child of Eleanor and Frederick Little, but his parents are planning to adopt, which the young boy is very excited about. As he leaves for school on the day of the adoption, he reminds his parents that he wants a little brother, not a big one. Eleanor and Frederick then go to the orphanage while their son is at school, and it looks like it's going to be a tough decision as they see all the human children, but then they find an intelligent mouse named Stuart. The couple is warned that adopting a member of a different species will not likely work out, but they still adopt Stuart and introduce him to his new home. When George comes back from school that day and sees who his parents have adopted, he is disappointed. This is not helped by the fact that the household's cat, Snowbell, is not happy about being the pet cat of a mouse, and when Monty, his alley cat friend, finds out about this, he inevitably finds it very funny, so Snowbell then seeks help from the neighbourhood alley cats to get rid of Stuart! This 1999 family adventure movie doesn't look that promising at the beginning, with a very enthusiastic George on the morning of the day his parents plan to adopt, but there certainly are some good parts after that. This includes some pretty funny moments, such as the segment with Monty the Mouth coming into the house and Snowbell trying to keep Stuart out of the visiting alley cat's sight, though Monty farting didn't amuse me. Aside from the humour, there are other memorably entertaining parts, such as the boat race, and the story gets more exciting later on. There are times when the film is a little too sappy, but this may be more of an issue near the beginning. Geena Davis and Hugh Laurie both play loving parents, but don't do an overly impressive job playing them. The live action performances in ""Stuart Little"" are generally not really that impressive, but there are some good voice-overs here. Michael J. Fox isn't bad in the title role, and the voices provided for the cats also stand out, including Chazz Palminteri as Smokey, the Chief Alley-Cat, who is like a mafia don. The CGI effects in this movie are excellent, with very realistic looking talking mice on two legs, and the way they made the cats' mouths open when they speak is also very convincing.I can see why this movie doesn't exactly have the greatest reputation, with all the flaws it has, but since I'm giving it a 6/10, I obviously think it has its merits. It's based on a children's novel of the same name, written by E. B. White and published over fifty years before this movie was made, and I've never read that book, but hear that this movie is only LOOSELY based on it. Maybe many fans of the book hate this movie, I don't know, and I obviously don't know how they compare and can easily believe that the book is superior, but judging this 1999 film for what it is, I would say much better family movies were made around the same time, but ""Stuart Little"" could have been far worse. With its positive aspects, which include the mild humour, some of the characters, good sentiment (even if it is overdone at times), nice visuals, and a story which may get better as it goes along, both kids and adults could find themselves impressed with this particular anthropomorphic animal story, more so than I was.",Stuart Little
32,gbheron,"Special effects, but not enough story",6,24 June 2001,"""Stuart Little"" has great special effects. They're not the towering effects of ""The Perfect Storm"" or ""Gladiator"", but nuanced, small stuff like the way Stuart's fur moves, or the beauty of the New York City skyline. In this movie, the special effects people steal the show. I wish the writers and actors were as good, but the special effects are as good as the movie gets.
The acting is just okay, the voice-over actors coming off better than the real ones. And the story is too juvenile for my tastes. Kids should love it, but it doesn't seem much thought was given to adult viewers. 
My recommendation is to see it with a kid, or give it a pass.",Stuart Little

It was extremely funny and enchanting (that mouse was so cute) and I believe if I (a 19 year old) likes this, a kid will absolutely love this film. No bad parts in this one. They actually make you believe that mouse can talk and it is normal. SO don't wonder if your kid wants a mouse after seeing this one.

35,mitsubishizero,Great movie!,9,2 November 2018,"I grew up watching this and it holds up well still. Interestingly, this was the last movie Estelle Getty starred in before her retirement as well as the fact that the screenplay was written by M. Night Shyamalan and Greg Booker. The story's loosely based on the book written by E.B. White with some of the plot being moved to the sequel. George Little (Jonathan Lipnicki) is the only child of Eleanor and Frederick Little (played by Geena Davis and Hugh Laurie). He wants a brother so while he's at school his parents visit the orphanage to adopt. They decide to adopt an anthropomorphic mouse named Staurt (voiced by Michael J. Fox) much to George and their pet cat Snowball's disappointment.It doesn't take long for Stuart to get the picture and begins to feel like an outcast. This leads him on a journey to find his real parents while avoiding cats who want to make a meal out of him. Will he find his true home and earn his place in the family? See for yourself. The movie's heartwarming and the effects are great. Both Stuart and Snowball (voiced by Nathan Lane) look like they're actually there. I like how the moral of this story is finding your true self and where you belong. The movie doesn't shy away from the dark side of being a foster parent and what they to go through. At the same time it's not completely dark as there're a lot of funny, tender moments. Not much else to say. Just watch and I guarantee you'll enjoy it.",Stuart Little
36,DukeEman,The kids enjoyed it and that's all that really mattered.,6,20 January 2002,"E. B White's creative book comes to life thanks to the perfection of modern technology. Cuteness is stamped all over the film, laden with ""the moral to the story"" stuff that you would expect from a fairy tale. It's fine when you read it but loses its charm when translated to the screen. The humans are just bearable but thanks to the domestic pets that make it absolute fun. The relationship between the house cat, Snowbell (voiced by Nathan Lane), and the adorable mouse, Stuart Little, (Michael J. Fox), is the amusing part of the film while the humans ham it for that extra bit of silliness.",Stuart Little

38,bigverybadtom,"No, It Doesn't Follow The Book",6,14 August 2013,"But when you think about it, why should it? I read it as a kid, and wasn't really impressed. It felt like a bunch of different scenes rather than a story. Stuart Little is a mouse-like child born (not adopted as in the movie) to human parents in New York City, he gets into some scrapes, he doesn't get along with the family cat, he saves a bird from said cat and the bird would save him later, he goes on a miniature boat ride in Central Park, he receives a small gasoline-powered car, abruptly leaves his family in quest of the bird (who has vanished), goes to a small town, takes a job briefly as a substitute teacher (and does badly at that), goes on a date with a female like himself, but the boat ends up ruined and so does the relationship, and in the end Stuart drives further out in his car.I wasn't really satisfied with the book even then, and I get the impression that it was more of a satire than a real attempt at a children's story (which was true of the ""Alice In Wonderland"" stories), and truth be told, it was no shock that the movie would have little to do with the book, which felt more like a bunch of scenes than an overall story.So how is the movie? Standard children's entertainment which has a more likable Stuart Little than the book's, and predictable. But at least it's suited for the kids, unlike many other movies supposedly for the family.",Stuart Little

Rated PG (for brief language and some mild violence)
By Blake French:""Every Little in the world can find the Little house.""That is not a quote from a small child or an estranged family member, but a talking mouse named Stuart Little. I had one major problem with the new family comedy from Rob Minkoff, ""Stuart Little,"" and it's with how the filmmakers dealt with the title character. Let me describe the film's flaw by explaining the story. As the movie opens we meet a sweet, loving family, consisting of Mr. and Mrs. Little and their lonely son, George. After sending George to school one day, the parents decide to travel to the local orphanage to take a look at the children up for adoption. Once there, they realize there is such a variety of kids, it would be next too impossible to make a fair choice. This is where the Little's are introduced to Stuart, a mouse who has been living at the orphanage for quite a while now. He greets them with humility, and offers to lend a helping hand in their choice. But no need to continue looking for a child to adopt, for the Little's have already made their decision, they will adopt Stuart. George is disappointed when he discovers that his new ""brother"" is a mouse that acts, talks, and has emotional qualities like a human. He wanted someone to share his time, play, and have fun with, not a household pet. Stuart becomes a bit tearful that he failed to live up to the entire families' expectations. 	When the Little's have a family reunion, their  relatives come to their home and share greetings. When introduced to Stuart everyone experiences disbelief, but almost immediately after, they except him. 
Why is Stuart able to feel, act, and talk like a person? Why do all the movie's characters, from tailors to orphanage directors,  just except the fact that a talking mouse is in their presence? What possesses the characters to treat the mouse like a human? I wanted an explanation of why Stuart is such a remarkable, larger than life mouse. None is offered. What if one was offered, though, where would that leave the film, to get into a scientific explanation of what happened to Stuart? That would leave the story confusing and boring. So you see, ""Stuart Little"" was doomed from the beginning, left with no where to go but down. The film contains an internal problem: Stuart's emotionally empty space inside; he feels that he'll never be a real member of the Little family. The external problem comes later in the story: Stuart is not loved by every member of his household. The Little's also own a cat named Snowbell, who experiences jealousy when he realizes that he is no longer the lesser being receiving all the attention.  He even arranges a hit to kill Stuart with his fellow ally cats. This subplot is far more interesting and entertaining than the center line of events. The animation and special computer animal effects are noteworthy and enormously convincing. The mice and cats look like they are really talking, unlike the poorly altered babies talking in ""Baby Geniuses."" It is amazing what the animation artists are capable of doing these days, and ""Stuart Little"" is a prime example of that. I liked the human actors in ""Stuart Little,"" a rather amateurish film to contain so many well-known names in its talented cast. On screen performers such as Hugh Laurie, Geena Davis, and minor roles by Brian Doyle-Murray, Estelle Getty, Julia Sweeney, and Jeffrey Jones. Also blossoming are the big voices heard throughout the picture, consisting of Michael J. Fox, David Alan Grier, Jennifer Tilly, Chazz Palminteri, and Nathan Lane. With this huge, gifted cast, ""Stuart Little"" should have been a better production.
The intelligence of Stuart Little seemed to be altered by certain demands of the script. Sometimes Stuart can travel across town in a miniature car and manage to find his way home, but at other points, he is required to submit to his nemesis's deceptions. This lack of consistency leads to a sluggish point of view, which regards the lack of inspirational material present.
""Stuart Little"" has a strong message and an applicable relationship with a character that's easy for its target audience to fall in love with. The reason this film doesn't work is better explained in comparison with the much better ""Toy Story 2."" That film did not try to blend our human world with its imaginative, colorful fantasy. It kept its boundaries in which the toys would come alive, and where they needed to be just regular playing figurines. ""Stuart Little"" makes the mistake in attempting to mix a dream world in with an ordinary lifestyle. An ultra-smart mouse is believable in movies, and to some extent in novels as well. But seeing a visual image of a mouse acting like a human and having the characters respond unresponsively is pushing it a little. Go see a good holiday family film, like ""Toy Story 2"" or the successful cousin of ""Stuart Little,"" ""Mousehunt.""

40,Min111,Welcome to the family,5,10 August 2020,"It's a movie where a family adopts a brother for their son George. He's named Stuart who happens to be a mouse. A mouse that can talk just like people. At first, George doesn't accept him, but they later get along, and they become like brothers. They participate in a boat race together in Central Park. That was one of the best parts of the movie. I liked that race. Can they win the race? You need to see it for yourselves. However, the cat is not happy named Snowbell who plans to get rid of him. Snowbell can also talk by the way. He talks very well. I like his character. Snowbell has a friend named Monty who spots Stuart. He wants to 'play' with him. Snowbell later meets Monty's boss named Smoky to get rid of the mouse. Stuart, later, has some unexpected guests or visitors. I won't say who they are. You need to see it to find out. I found Stuart Little funny - it's laughable. It's a comedy movie. It's an adventure for Stuart Little, and what an adventure it has been for the little rodent. Stuart Little is a fun movie for the family. I don't like the lady that played Eleanor Little. I thought she was a wrong choice, and should've been played by another person. That's what I think. Yes, the guy that played Frederick Little is from the 101 Dalmatians, and the boy that played George is from The Little Vampire. Stuart Little is worth checking out. It will be a fun ride.

43,jmathur_swayamprabha,I love this rat,10,21 October 2010,"I have watched only a handful of Hollywood movies including gems like Gandhi and Titanic. However today I am reviewing the Hollywood movie which is closest to my heart. It is Stuart Little. At the time of watching it for the first time, I was expecting it to be a movie mainly made for the children. However after watching it fully, not only I have got addict to watch it every time it is telecast on TV on any channel and irrespective of the fact whether the version is Hindi (dubbed) or English (the original one). This movie has gone so deep into my heart that it moves me every time I watch it.Stuart Little is a unique combination of computerised animation and live action. The central character - Stuart is a rat and there are certain other animal characters in the movie in the form of the cat - Snowbell, his friends (cats) and one rat couple playing the fake parents of Stuart. These have been managed through computerised animation (with their dialogues dubbed in human voices). And then we have human characters too which are the members of the Little family (husband, wife and male kid) plus the supporting characters. The activities and relationships of all these animated and human characters form the touching screenplay of Stuart Little which is undoubtedly an outstanding movie winning many awards.Little rat Stuart is adopted by Little family consisting of Mr. Fredrick Little; his wife, Eleanor; their son, George and the pet cat Snowbell. The Little couple loves its adopted son very much but George is not ready to accept it as his brother and Snowbell is not happy to have a new member in the house sharing the love of its masters. How Stuart wins the hearts of both George and Snowbell and finally settles down in the family after a short span of separation from them because of a rat couple claiming to be its parents, forms the remaining story.Director Rob Minkoff has excellently directed the story adapted from the book of E.B. White with the screenplay written by Manoj Night Shyamalan and Greg Booker. The movie is so engrossing that the viewer hardly realises when it comes to its end. It is well-paced, yet very touching movie. Right from the background score to the dialogues of the animals in the voices of Michael J. Fox (for Stuart), Nathan Lane (for Snowbell) and others to the camera work and art direction to the performances of the artists (Huge Laurie, Geena Davis and Jonathan Lipnicki as the Little family), everything is just superb. The animated white rat (Stuart) looks adorable and lovely. Seeing it wearing different style of clothes and doing different things like the human-beings is an experience to cherish. The scene of the boat-race is outstanding. The film does not let the viewer down even for a moment.Now the bigger question is - why do I like a children's movie so much that I am ready to watch it countless number of times ? In fact, I have given standing instructions to my children to call me immediately whenever they find Stuart Little being telecast on any channel whether in English or in Hindi (dubbed version). Let me explain the reason for being so much passionate about this movie. This movie establishes Indian family values which are universal in their appeal in the most effective manner. The love and affection among the family members, their adjustments and compromises to accommodate one another, their readiness to sacrifice own joy and benefit for the fellow member's sake; everything touches me deep within. Two members of a family may not look alike, they may not be associated biologically and there may be a plethora of apparent differences between them, still the bond of love, if well-knit, can keep them mentally close.The love of the Little couple (especially the mother) for the adopted rat and the rat's reciprocation is able to confirm my view that our love can find its genuine expression even for the animals. When Snowbell, the pet cat of the house (after first misguiding Stuart when it returns back to home and then consipiring with its friends to kill Stuart) finally saves Stuart's life from its friends, i.e., other cats; Stuart tells them (other cats) that it is not necessary for two members of a family to look like one another and the love can stand despite the appearance difference; is a lesson for all in the human-world too.Stuart Little has everything to recommend itself. It generates laughters. It generates amusement. It generates emotions and tears. Not only me, anyone who has seen it once, can watch it several times. I have seen its sequel too. However it is the first and the original part which has had a standing (positive) impact upon me.I end my review with the final dialogues in the Hindi version of the movie. When Stuart is finally back home in the ending scene, it asks George - Kya Ek Sukhi Parivaar Aisa Hi Hota Hai ? (Is a happy family like this only ?) and gets George's reply - Haan Jab Sapne Sach Hote Hain (Yes, when the dreams come true).",Stuart Little

46,Puroo,Quite decent but I will never watch it again,7,14 July 2021,"As a kid I never really liked Stuart Little. The animated show used to come on TV but for some reason I wasn't really fond of it. I think it had something to do with the fact that its animation is not really kid-friendly and it does not have the same sense of humour as Tom and Jerry or Looney tunes. It was only later that I got to know that this is a movie and the animated show was just an adaptation. My sister watch this movie as a kid, so we decided to to watch attack on watch it on Amazon Prime for the sake of nostalgia. It was quite fun to watch, but not something I would want to rewatch.Stuart Little is a story about the eponymous mouse who comes to live with his adopted family and how he slowly bonds with them over regular family issues. I personally think that Stuart Little is a very good example of teaching children how animals are also sentient beings like us. In spite of being a smaller creature Stuart proves that he is not of smaller value. This is exactly what makes this character so special. He does not give up on his dignity when someone talks down to him, which would happen either if he decides to turn violent or if he accepts what they are saying.Initially George was not very happy when he learnt that his family decided to adopt an animal instead of getting him a new sibling. Not just him, but their domestic house cat Snowbell was also very tensed about what other cats will say when they find out a mouse has become his master. And so he decides to get Stuart out of the house by hook or by crook. But in spite of all this Stuart continues to help them in need, like when he made George's boat for the boat racing competition and helping Snowbell escape from the cats.The cinematography of this movie is very good, but it is not suited for a children's movie. It has a very adult feeling to it, considering it has a hole some humour and not an outrageously humorous one. This is probably the reason why I didn't like the animated show, and now I can see where this problem came from. The visual tone and colour palette are such that this movie can only appeal to the audience of Harry Potter or Narnia, which is a very different target audience from what this movie aims to focus on.Although I liked the movie, I found to be very boring. It's not something I can watch after I grow up without dozing off. This is the reason why I have said that I will not watch it again. It seems a drag to watch this even when I have to show it to someone else. Plus this movie doesn't suit adults very much because of its child-like conflicts and happy ending. I haven't watched any sequels and I don't plan to. I hope there is nothing worthwhile in the sequel which I have to watch to understand something from this movie, not like this looks like that kind of a movie.",Stuart Little

55,len-21,7 on a scale of 10,7,30 December 1999,"This is a movie that I think most kids will like, but that isn't saying all that much. I mean name a movie (for kids) that they didn't like. Quick.One of the interesting things about animation (or talking animals) is trying to figure out the voices. I had most of them right on, but I sure thought one of the cats was Billy Crystal. It turned out to be Nathan Hale.The movie was moderately entertaining and reasonably well done. I had a little bit of a hard time accepting the premise (talking mouse) - especially since there is zero evidence of that being normal in the world they found themselves in, yet every human accepted it as reasonable.Also, talking animals reminded me WAY too much of the movie Babe. I hated that movie despite how well done it was - which reminds me.... If Babe was so great, then why did the sequel drop dead. It wasn't that it was poorly done. Gene Siskel said it was better than the first one and couldn't wait for the third one. The reason is because millions of people like me saw the first one due to critical acclaim - thus high gross revenues, but would never have gone to see the second one - thus bomb. Talking animals is generally a weak idea. Unlike BABE, at least this one was for exclusively for kids - and kids have no problem with talking animals.The other criticism is the language. The movie received a PG rating for brief cussing - mostly of the ""damn"" variety. But, why is it necessary? The theater was full of kids. The idea of a PG is to broaden the base, but who is going to see this movie besides kids and their parents??? It is totally unnecessary to have the foul language in it and I wouldn't recommend it to a parent who was sensitive to it. There, take that you bean counters!",Stuart Little
56,nethy-nho,Weird but cute,8,8 May 2019,"I saw this so many times when I was a child, and seeing nowadays, I can perceives that still is great, the family foster a mouse as a son it's pretty weird, and the fact that he can speak and at all, it's didn't explain, but you just enter into this universe and accept this because it's not important. The relationship of the family is so lovely, and the real son with Stuart it's really what happens normally, the jealous, the fights. No question the cat (Snowbell) it's my favorite character, he's so mean, and sarcastic, but you can likes with time. In the end, the movie it's timeless, and all the times that you see you will feel better. I love so much <3",Stuart Little
57,Benjamin_Cox,"Big fun for the little ones, less so for grown ups - 63%",6,20 April 2006,"There seems to be an unwritten rule in Hollywood that any film with a talking animal in it must be solely aimed at kids. You can understand the thinking – before CG made it possible for everyone to do, Disney seemed to have a policy of making every movie with talking animals, from ""Cinderella"" to ""The Lion King"". And while the techniques may have changed, the formula remains the same with kiddie-friendly entertainment wrapped around a sugary sweet moral tale. In that respect, ""Stuart Little"" is the classic children's film given a fresh lick of paint but if you do the basics right, ""classic"" can still work.Geena Davis and Hugh Laurie play the Littles, a successful family living in a small old-fashioned terrace house in New York with their young son George (Jonathan Lipnicki) and their cat Snowbell (voiced by Nathan Lane). When the Littles decide to adopt a brother for George, they come back with an adorable mouse named Stuart (voiced by Michael J Fox). But neither George nor Snowbell initially take to Stuart's arrival and before long, Snowbell begins to form a plan to make sure Stuart's stay with the Littles is a brief one.I can't fault the technical aspect of ""Stuart Little"" as the little blighter looks fantastic. And like most kids films, everything is bright and colourful from set design to costumes. Performances from the three leads are also good with Laurie's American accent frighteningly realistic. But while the film is perfectly harmless fun for the little ones, I'm afraid that there isn't much there for the grown-ups to enjoy. It's more of a technical showcase than an entertaining movie and reminded me of the similarly themed film ""Cats And Dogs"". Yes, Stuart himself looks so cute and realistic but it's a pity that same effort and attention didn't go to the rest of the film as it never really engages you or holds your interest for very long.In some ways, there is nothing wrong with ""Stuart Little"" as it does pretty much exactly what it says on the tin. It's undemanding family fun that definitely appeals to children more than it does to adults. But it feels too long and the plot never really gets going, although things do pick up when the running battle between Snowbell and Stuart reaches its climax in Central Park. But I found myself wondering why nobody questioned the insanity of legally adopting a talking mouse but maybe that speaks more about my cynicism than anything else. If you get it for your kids then the chances are, they'll enjoy it but don't expect anything as much fun as, say, ""Shrek"" or ""The Incredibles"".",Stuart Little

His expressions were very human.Story was nothing new, but lots of action to keep the kids interested. For the children at heart: The cats. They were kewl! Loved their voices.CONCLUSION?

Geena Davis is very standard as well as the other casts. But look at that little mouse!

65,paulo20,So cute I wanted to barf (slight spoiler),2,26 April 2000,"I was never interested in seeing this movie, but my brother happened to rent it based on someone's recommendation so I figured, what the hey, at least I'm not paying for it.  That's one of the few saving graces of my watching this film.  It was worse than even I expected and I tried very hard to watch this with an open mind.  First of all, the sappy dialogue: I just could not believe the dead seriousness in which it was delivered or the sugary violins surging in the background.  My brother forwarded liberally through parts like these (and there are a lot of them) and instead of objecting, as I would usually do, I secretly thanked him.  One might think you can't judge a film if you miss parts of it but I just couldn't bear watching scenes like this.  The scenes between the father (played by Hugh Laurie) and the son (played by an inanimate wooden puppet...I mean that kid from Jerry McGuire) were the worst.  I half-expected someone to say `Where's the Beav?'.  My dark fantasy for this movie was to have Rowan Atkinson playing his character from Black Adder enter the movie and rip Hugh Laurie to shreds.  Then there's Stuart himself.  He seemed to me more cutesy than cute (i.e. the filmmakers were practically banging me over the head with his cuteness).Anyway, back to the movie itself.  The one other saving grace of this movie, may have been the cats who managed to elicit a few chuckles (though not hearty guffaws).  Plus I just like cats, even though in SL they were portrayed as toned-down gangsters (villains, again while the mice, which in reality spread filth and disease and leave little turds all over the foodstuffs, are the good guys - oh well, at least one of the cats redeemed himself) and had that silly computer animation messing up their faces.  The little fat mouse (voiced by Bruno Kirby who sounds an awful lot like Joe Pesci) was somewhat amusing as well.  Oh yeah, the effects were OK, too.Other than that, this movie eats.  To use the cat Snowbell's words `Excuse me while I cough up a hairball.'  I don't mean to rain on anyone's parade but I just found this an insipid, cloying mess.  I just couldn't get into it at all.  I know this was made as a family film and, thus, was probably not made with someone like me in mind.  But considering that the Toy Story movies were also family films and that I absolutely loved those, what really is Stuart Little's excuse?",Stuart Little
66,miken-3,Big Budget Nonsense,3,18 January 2000,This movie was like watching a weird cartoon where utter nonsense is accepted as normal.

67,TheMysteriousReviewer,A Guilty Pleasure Family Flick,7,15 May 2021,"Stuart Little is a decent family film in my book. I consider this one of my guilty pleasures is because it plays too safe for its own good. The story can be generic, the comedy is stale, and the cats are the obvious antagonists of the film. And what I mean by for the movie's own good it plays safe is the heart does come to the right place. The movie sets up as a family movie about the importance of family. Sure, it wants to be on the nose about it. But it can work in some ways towards the end. Being there for one another. The use of the visuals on Stuart, the Stouts and the cats are very nice. The cinematography gives a nice view of New York City. And the characters are quite enjoyable. I wouldn't consider this a must watch, but if you need to watch something for the family that's about families, this could be the movie for you. I'll admit, it's a very solid book adaptation. It's the film needs to work a little more on the writing.",Stuart Little
68,Signet,Not Quite,6,1 June 2000,"What a disappointment.  Despite the amazing computer animation, the film falls flat.

I thought it was gonna be another Baby Genius type of movie but it had a good plot and some cool cats. A lot of things are far fetched but when you're a kid I guess ignorance is bliss so that can be overlooked. It was interesting to have Geena Davis in it. She's been out of the spotlight lately and this is not the way to get back in to it but she was pretty good in this. This was just a solid, entertaining movie, sure shows Van Damme a thing or two.",Stuart Little
70,Calysta,A credit to live film animation,9,23 April 2000,"Considering myself too grown up to face the terrifying throes of cartoon animation at age fourteen, I found myself mortified and aghast at the possibility of being reminded of the painful movie excursion to see ""Pokemon"" so soon, even if the little critter looked cute in the preview trailer.Later I was reminded by the meaning of unwanted neck pains as a result of choosing a deliberately badly positioned seat in the theatre in order to see as little of the picture as possible.Michael J. Fox performs a beautiful voice over characterisation of the witty, amusing Stuart, as does Nathan Lane as the non-scary cat villain, Snowbell. The best thing about the actual actors is that they are at least doing their best not to be obvious as second features of interest, and aren't too bad in the process. After all, it is hard to blame Stuart for stealing his own show.One of the most interesting non-screen elements I found interesting was the fact that M. Night Shyamalan was the author of the amusing and well written screenplay. Having the writer and directorial credit of ""The Sixth Sense"" to your name is definitely not too shabby. Although relatively a new comer to mainstream film production, his ability to pen appropriate writings in two far differed genres is evident and I hope he returns to write a sequel to the film should one be produced.   However, I did learn some all important lessons:1. Never conclude anything about a film until AFTER seeing it. Unfortunately, I will never be able to have the same optimism for Pokemon.
2. Not a good idea to view ""Stuart"" with those less than ambitious about mice, in particular those with fears ranging from high to major phobia category. The idea of family bondage with rodents, in particular those with the ability to speak has turned some unsuspecting people I know off anything with mild animation forever.3. Siamese cats are a good complement with pet mice because their daily activities consist solely of dining in style and mass exposure to nature's warm elements.4. Children will always mostly love animation, good or bad. At least this is a more than pleasant example.5. Hollywood can still make a good film without computerising the whole thing entirely.6. No one has to die, be injured or violently advanced upon to produce good, subtle special effects. Despite all skepticism, it is difficult to resist the irresistible, ageless appeal of any film featuring a form of animation. Not everyone is going to be thirsty for this particular cup of tea, but it has a sort of undeniable aroma about it anyway.Perhaps if we wait another sixty years, Stuart Little, mouse extraordinaire, may achieve fame and lasting legacy as great as that of Mickey Mouse.

Of course it doesn't take long for the two of them to start liking eachother and, of course, there's a happy ending for everyone.

I expect that in Stuart Little 2, the Little family will be moving out to Nebraska so that they can take advantage of living in the Little house on the prairie.I'm a little (no pun intended) surprised that I enjoyed this film and I do recommend it.

It is very frustrating for me to tell cat-haters this, but it doesn't help with stupid movies trying to make cats look even worse.Plus, this movie isn't like the book. It's been ""disney-ed"" up. I'm not sure if it's even a Disney movie, but it looks like one.Cats aren't evil. They are very adorable. They won't scratch your furniture if you have a scratching-post. They won't ""go"" anywhere like puppies when they're little, or when they're older, if they're properly trained and have their box cleaned out regularly.I hate this movie terribly!",Stuart Little

Why didn't they use a child's voice instead of Micheal J. Fox's? The tiny creature talks deeper than the kid in the family. There was nothing very special, it's much like an old children's movie renewed with a mouse added to it. The boat race was the only bit interesting, but others...did not live up to my expectations.

Too bad - for many parents want a ""G"" movie for their children with none of those things.  This movie has a few unnecessary curse words and thus was granted its ""PG"" rating.  Does Hollywood realize that as a ""PG"" hardly any schools in the USA will be permitted to show the movie to their classes????CAUTION:  The subject of adoption is mishandled!  Your small adopted child will likely worry about two things after the movie:(1) Your adopted parents only keep you until your ""real"" parents come along and want to take you away - and you must go even if you do not want to leave your adopted parents.(2) Adoptions of children who are ""different"" (race, size, specie, etc.) causes problems and may not work out (as told by the adoption lady to the family) - although there is a happy ending.The fantastic book by E.B.White does not deal with adoption - Stuart is just a regular member of his human family, regardless of the fact that he looks like (is ?) a mouse, which makes for a better fairy tale.The CATS:  The cats make for the best part of this movie.  We cat lovers know how each cat is an individual with some sort of attitude or other.  The best lines and the biggest laughs were reserved for the cats - as it should be!SO:  Take the kids.

BUT, there is something extremely, hugely likeable about it.Its refreshingly old fashioned in that it is a really nice, happy, pure family film.  I went to see it with two of my friends, all of us around the ages of 20 and 21 and we all thoroughly enjoyed it.It has a few cracking one-liners and a few nice action set pieces but it scores by just being a really watchable, likeable, lovable film.

Parents should find nothing offensive or overly frightful in this good adaptation of E. B. White's children's novel.  It presents some good traditional lessons like, ""winning isn't everything, it's how you play the game,"" and some new ones (that even some adults need to learn) like, ""you can't hold others responsible when things don't go your way."" The kiddies should be fascinated by the excellent blend of CGI and live-action.  Particularly noteworthy is the scene with the alley cats in the tree hunting down Stuart.  There's some fine detail to watch for throughout.  You actually start to believe these animals can talk and show emotion just like humans!  Unfortunately, great special effects do not a great movie make, and parents might find this one a sacrafice for the sake of their children to get through.  My recommendation to survive all the silly, sugar-coated, overwrought goodie-goodie dialogue and scenery is to see it as a kind of dark humor, especially in the performances of Geena Davis and Hugh Laurie.  But it is Nathan Lane who steals the show.  His voice-over as Snowbell - the resentful, snide, yet ""mousey"" house pet - is delightful.  I can't imagine anyone else other than Lane doing the voice.  So while the kids are enjoying the real show, the adults can have something to snicker at - but turn your head and do it to yourself, after all this one is for the children.",Stuart Little

Stuart Little is a story of great human interest. On the surface, it appears like its made for children because the cast include animals led by my favorite protagonist, the mouse Stuart Little. For children, it is simple happy entertainment feature but I think, for adults, it is of great human interest because the animals (e.g. cats and the mouse Stuart Little really personify people's nature. The movie serves as man's mirror of himself-its very effective for self-evaluation and change. I think movies that have animals portraying human characteristics are the most objective means of letting people know with what they are identified with, to determine if there are some things in themselves that need to change in order for them to be useful members of society. This evaluation of the content of the movies is based on my analysis of the real substance of Stuart Little's story. Overall, its a very nice movie for general patronage- very wholesome and relaxing.

It was a nice movie, and extremely pretty, and good special effects, and enough new twists on more fart jokes and I had any hopes to expect. But it was constantly reminding you that it didn't trust the magic of the book. Everything had to be Bigger, More Relevant, More Dramatic. It couldn't remain a simple and unexplained fact that Stuart, who looked a lot like a mouse, but who was in fact Stuart, was an unusual-looking boy born to the Littles. In an attempt at Greater Relevance, the rewriters decided that it needed to wink at racial issues, be coy with ""inter-species"" adoptions, and just generally try to take something fine as it was, and Update. It ended up with all the charm of a really snazzy Vegas lounge version of something from Rubber Soul.

Boring and worn out as this is, it is also shown in the most blunt and unsophisticated way.I don't know if the director believed that he was being creative by introducing a mouse to the cliché, or he was just trying to fill in minutes, but he only upgraded the cliché from boring to abhorrent.Then why I gave a 3 and not a ZERO? Because of the family cat, who loves Stuart as much as the ""brother"". And because of some funny gigs, where Stuart makes good use of his small size.On the overall I believe that the film would work reasonably well if: a. Stuart was a PET and not a ""sibling"". b.

There is one major problem with this; you can't drive a remote control car from inside it. The director might have come up with the idea to put the remote control in the car, maybe making the car in a convertible to allow it to fit but instead Stuart drove the battery powered car (with the sounds of a petrol engine) all around Central Park. On the same idea of the car, one possibility of added comedy would have been Stuart learning to drive and maybe crashing into household objects in the process (one assumes that a mouse just taken out of an orphanage with no recollection of his parents doesn't have a driving license).Stuart Little was never going to be a major blockbuster but it could have been a great deal better. However, there were some good points such as the amusing voice of Michael J.

How about saying it...500 times over and over again?,1,10 June 2007,"I will start this review with a disclaimer: I'm probably not the best person to review this film. I'm a hard-core cynic and I loathe corniness and cheesy-ness to an almost impossible degree. So if you're looking for a cute movie to show your small, happy child, disregard this review. Because I'm about to review an animated children's movie like I would an actually serious movie that an average adult would like to see. They're out there. There are films like the Ice Ages,Chicken Run, Wallace and Grommit...which I really did enjoy. Stuart Little was not one of them. The only reason I gave this movie 4/10 was because of the absolute hilarity of seeing Mr. Laurie be...well, kind and supportive and cliché and cheesy. Stuart Little itself, however, was only interesting to make fun of. Not to actually watch. The plot is stupid and predictable, the mouse is annoying, and the funny moments are only funny in laughing-at-them-not-with-them sort of way. I actually found myself hoping that something would happen to save this train-wreck of a viewing experience...like Stuart getting eaten by the cat, or the other way around. Or Hugh Laurie getting one half-way decent (read: mean-spirited and rude) line.",Stuart Little
146,rhondaraymond,Decent effort,7,3 April 2012,"The animation is superb and only occasionally does Stuart look out of place in the frame. For the most part it all flows well together and was deserving of the Oscar nomination. Just as deserving is the animal training - anyone with cats will know how hard it is to get the little b*stards to do anything you want, so to have them do so much work is very impressive (although I understand it is all about food).The cast are all pretty good. Davis and Laurie play it straight and are lumbered with carrying the emotional side of the film and don't have much comedy (a shame considering Laurie's talents). Michael J. Fox does the best work - he makes his Stuart very sweet and likable; a true prince amongst mice! Lipnicki does OK but is basically just the 'cute kid' that is legally required in all American family movies. The funny stuff comes from Lane, Zahn, Kirby, Tilly and, best of all, Palminteri, who's mafia cat is hilarious and sends up his own characters by doing so.Overall this is an enjoyable family film. It may not be hilarious for adults in the way Toy Story and it's like are but it is not dull. It has characters for adults and plenty for children and it's all a bit of fun with a slightly overly sweet centre to it.",Stuart Little
147,jsdunn,Worst movie adaptation of a book ever,1,2 January 2009,"They should have called this movie: ""Adopted Mouse Brother That is Slightly Inspired by Someone's Vague Recollection of Stuart Little Who Just Kind of Skimmed the Book a Little, But Mostly Just Remembered the Cover"" If it wasn't so misleading I'd give it a better review.But seriously people, do your kids a favor and have them read the book. They might actually learn something instead of having their mind numbed by what we all know as Hollywood film.The book Stuart little isn't about a mouse, it's about a person who happens to be very small and mouse-like. He's born to his parents, not adopted. The book is about his life and his eventual departure from home and the journey he embarks on. There is a cat named Snowball who thinks he's food and wants to eat him, but Snowball can't talk. In the movie they screw all of that up. I think the only things that they kept from the book were the boat race and the names.",Stuart Little
148,syahmi-91968,Was a pretty decent movie with a few plot and cgi holes,7,5 February 2019,"The storyline was pretty straighforward and the cgi at times just didnt seem to work out, for example there were scenes when stuarts hands became extremely long and disturbing. Also how do the boats or car magically act like an actual boat or car. And how do they somehow communicate so easily between species?",Stuart Little
149,igo4it2,New Children's Classic,9,25 December 1999,"If you liked ""Babe"", you will love ""Stuart Little"".  It is funny, witty, and totally entertaining even for adults. ""Especially"" for adults might fit too. I took my 11 year old daughter, and she thought it was great.  Each of the critters takes on their very own unique personality-very believable. The voices fit to a ""T"".  This is one very cuuuute movie that I'm sure will be a classic.",Stuart Little
150,Japong,Mice can be Men too...,8,11 February 2000,"Stuart Little is so human-like that you'd think he's a young boy trapped in a mouse's body.  Even during the first time Mr. and Mrs. Little meet him you'd think they were talking to just another ""one of the boys"".The vocal characterizations and animations of the animals here are very good, even better than the ""talking pig"" films ('Gordy' and the 2 'Babes'...)  You could say they developed MORE characters using LESS species.  Definitely recommended family entertainment...",Stuart Little
151,jacktorr,Fine Little Film,9,5 June 2000,"I got this off Pay per view for my 6-yr-old and found myself watching it with her over and over. To echo some of the other comments, a refreshing little children's film. I was really impressed by the sets and how they gave a sort of ""Sunday morning comics"" feel to the whole film. If you liked Homeward Bound, you'll probably like this. If not, watch something else.",Stuart Little
152,RacCooney-2,great effects highlight tale of an adopted mouse,8,19 December 1999,"Great special effects and lots of humor, adventure, and charm highlight this fantasy tale of an anthropomorphic mouse who gets adopted by a human family. There are sight gags revolving around the mouse's size, and characters like mobster cats. At first the son of the couple who adopts ""Stuart"" is hesitant to accept him as his ""brother"" but Stuart does all he can to win the young boy over. Those who enjoy tales of tiny creatures in a big world (see ""Indian in the Cupboard"" and ""The Borrowers"") should love this film.",Stuart Little
153,Shon R.-2,Wow!,9,25 December 1999,"Stuart Little was really funny!   The acting is a little bit overdone, but it works fine in this movie which is obviously light hearted.  And the special effects are really good, too.  Never once does Stuart look like a piece of computer animation walking through the film (unlike effects in that silly Star Wars movie of recent vintage). The cats are the funniest things in the movie.  I laughed constantly. I don't know why they had to use curse words, but that just made them funnier.  Incidentally, parents, this movie is really really clean.  There are a few minor swear words by those cats, but that's the only objectionable thing in the whole film. I'm impressed!  Stuart Little is a creative movie with good fx, simple but original plot, good strong family values (unusual, huh?), and it's really funny!  Wow!",Stuart Little
154,petter-b,Great movie for children!,8,6 December 1999,"The movie is plain and simple an oldfashion child comedy. The story is also short and simple to follow for the children, and without being to transparent. The characters are vividly described and funny. Fortunately not too complex either, something that helps the children follow the redline from the beginning to the end.",Stuart Little
155,momdoc,Film keeps the magic of the books,9,3 January 2000,"My wife or I read for an hour every evening with each of our six kids, until they were twelve or so. Stuart Little was one of the characters we got to know and love. We found this film charming and entertaining, and were impressed that its creators were able to preserve the basic premise of the books: People seem to easily accept, and sometimes even overlook, the fact that Stuart is a mouse who talks and wears clothing.We found the character development good (one rarely sees three dimensional personalities in this genre) and the ""human"" performers quite credible. Gena Davis, in particular, seemed to be enjoying herself. We are past being impressed by special effects, but there was a reasonable story to carry the film. Recommended for children four to eighty-four.",Stuart Little
156,rh-9,"Very entertaining, not exactly like the book",8,20 December 1999,"As a child I loved the book ""Stuart Little"". When the movie came out I was very excited to see it and did so on opening night. I was a little disappointed that the movie did not more closely track the plot of the book. Particularly, I was sad that the bird, Margalo was not included. However, taken for what it was, I thought it was a very cute movie and the special effects were great. I would highly recommend it to anyone who is not upset by movies that ""are not like the book"". There were a lot of very funny cat scenes.",Stuart Little
157,snt,Over Rated,1,14 January 2000,I couldnt wait for Dec 17th to come out to see Stuart Litte. I thought the previews looked like it was gonna be a really great movie. Dont get me wrong I love kids movies. I took my Husband and son to see this movie and we didnt care for it at all. It was like it was nothing for a mouse to talk. The story line of adoption as wrong. People dont adopt a mouse. When they had a party for the family member (Stuart) It was like it was normal for a mouse to get a childs bike........The movie wasnt even funny. See my family and I usually talk about the movie we see on the way home in the car. Well the only thing I have to say is it was awful quite on the way home. This movie I wont go see twice,Stuart Little
158,rsavard,My son and I,8,21 January 2000,"For what ever reason, I did go to this movie with my son that I would not have gone to on any other day. As the first scene started, I saw my son sitting there smiling with a soda in one hand and popcorn in the other. Watching him enjoy himself put me in the mood to relax and enjoy the movie. I did. Thats when the magic started.Stuart Little was, for a lack of words, wonderful! My son and myself laughed and cried together. The special effects had to be the best ever to date. That little mouse was not an ""effect"" he was REAL!The story about family was deep and heart felt. Never take your family for granted. Both my son and myself left hand in hand.",Stuart Little
159,CUBWOLF,my thoughts on stuart little,9,3 June 2000,What a great movie!Myself and my 4 kids have watched it again and again.Magical is the word i would use to describe this film.The whole feel of the movie is fairytale like and even though you get to see the trickery at the end of the film(on dvd anyway)you still cant help thinking that stuart is real.,Stuart Little
160,robbie3056,the most charming film i have seen in ages,9,6 July 2000,stuart little is almost perfect family entertainment. michael j fox is perfect for stuart and johnathan lipsniki is nearly as cool as he was in jerry maguire. the parents are a bit too sweet but the cat snowbell makes up for this. he is nasty and cruel and the gangster cats are hilarious but menacing. the special effects are amazing. i think stuart little 2 will kick ass.,Stuart Little
161,sfagurilla,nice,10,10 August 2000,"stuart little is the loveliest film ever. he walks and talks and drives a car and brushes his teeth and smiles and everything!! i love stuart little the lovely mouse. i am looking to adopt one similar. the closest so far has been a hamster squirrel, which does brush it's teeth, but doesn't talk yet.",Stuart Little
162,rugbyiscool,Yes. 2/10.,2,17 March 2019,"I reviewed this movie a 2/10. When I saw this movie in my ""Top Picks For Devin"" category on Netflix, I was hopeful. I thought ""Finally a movie I can get behind, an adventurous rat and his journey through boyhood."" The colorfulk scenery integued me and the portrayal of the small boy child made me giggle at times. But I was dissapointed at around 13:00 into the movie as the curious mose found his way into the clutches of a deadly washing machine. ""The tension is finially rising"" I thought, ""This is the part where he dies."" I flailed my arms in dissapointment when he escaped. I thought this was gonaa be just the kind of movie I like. tHIS MOVIE WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH BETTER IF THEY JUST LET HIM DIE. Some may argue that this movie is for children, but I would argue that this would be a great approtunity to learn for the kids. But this hatred might be a result of the character's annoying attributes. But overall I would reccomend this movie if you're the type of person who enjoys being dissapointed.",Stuart Little
163,zoneboy-62830,Charming and Unique Film,8,8 August 2021,"Stuart Little delivers a package of comedy and adventure that few films seem to deliver.Action sequences: 1. Snowbell lands in a trash can in attempt to attack Stuart. 2. In the boat race, Stuart nearly falls in the water, but he is able to stay afloat and win the race. 3. The cats corner Stuart in Central Park and Stuart gets in his roadster and zips off, with the cats in hot pursuit. Stuart then detours into a sewer pipe. However, the pipe comes to an end, but Stuart does not notice it in time. The roadster then flies off the edge into the water below, slamming into the water with a loud splash. The roadster completely sinks beneath the water. Stuart emerges from the surface of the water and escapes by using his suitcase as an object to jump off and latch onto a grate. 4. Stuart and Snowbell defeat the cats by slapping one of them into the water below and Snowbell snapping a branch with the rest of the cats on it, sending them into the water, too.Bonding Moments: 1. After winning the boat race for George, Stuart is then referred to by George as his ""little brother."" 2. As the Stouts are escorting Stuart out of the Little House, George gives Stuart his miniature roadster as a mode of transportation.Funny Moments: 1. George says he needs lucky underwear to win the boat race. 2. While chasing Stuart, one of the cats says they hope one of the other cats runs out of gas.",Stuart Little
164,bodali,Stuart Little is a great children's movie; isn't the whole point of a kids' movie that they enjoy it and have fun watching it? I thought so. . .,10,6 July 2006,"Stuart Little is a wonderful movie for children to watch. It inspires children to use their imaginations. It is fun for them to watch and keeps them interested from beginning to end. The main reason for making a children's movie is the enjoyment the kids will get from watching it, right? Well, I say, ""Job well done!"" My 2 1/2 year old granddaughter absolutely loves it. We have watched it probably 50+ times, and she never gets tired of it. She always laughs at the funny parts --- she absolutely adores Stuart Little! I think you people should be a little less critical and try to be more open-minded. Don't you have children? If you do, give it a try. This movie is a winner --- two thumbs up! Thank you.",Stuart Little

He has these little eyes that stare into your soul and make you feel disgusted with yourself for things you never did. He is slowly drenching my soul out of my body and every time i look at him i want him to drench it faster. He has a head that is shaped in a weird way and his eyes are forward facing and therefore he's a predator which makes me all the more scared of him.Did not pass the vibe check.,Stuart Little

So, this movie is for someone who? I guess, Nothing wrong happen is very best thing in their life like people. Weekends Family have to go shopping and give some joy to their kids...requiring PG movie. No harm, No damage, No worrysome.Thank you to Big great present for kids.

174,jacobsmithdude,Great movie for all the Family,7,3 September 2015,"Note - This is a condensed version of my review Pros: To start I felt the voice and on screen actors gave great performances. Michael J. Fox as the voice of Stuart little was a great choice as he brings in my opinion allot of charm and emotion to the role, now it may seem strange to cast him as the voice of a ten year old mouse even though at the time Michael was in his late thirties. It's really hard to comment on though because I thought the voice and the character design fitted perfectly. The rest of the voice cast are great too, Nathan lane as the voice of Snowbell is again another great casting choice, and he brings so much charm to the role as this reluctant and over melodramatic feline, not to mention Steve Zhan as Monty the alley cat who brings allot of wisecracking humour to the role. The on Screen performances are also very really great; Keep in mind that Huge Laurie, Geena Davis and Jonathan Lipnicki all had to work with thin air, literally. As Stuart was this CGI character, he'd later be brought onto the big screen through post production as all the on screen actors had to work with was maybe a replica doll of Stuart and then would have to do the actual take with just them imagining he was there on the set so it's pretty impressive considering that's what they had to work with throughout the majority of the film. I also have to mention that the score by Alan Silvestri is incredible. I felt the score truly brought Stuart little to life and made all of these small sized adventures seem more grand and captivating than originally thought. Now some may say that the score can get some what overly whimsical at times however I thought the score was perfect for this film and really stands out during the Central Park Boat Race. Alan Silvestri has performed scores for many films including allot of Robert Zemeckis productions including the Back to the Future Trilogy, Forest Gump, Cast Away and even the first two Predator films not to mention a couple Marvel films including captain America: The First Avenger and the Avengers. I should also mention the direction of Rob Minkoff is great too; some of the action scenes in the film including the Central Park Boat Race and a car chase that happens later on in the film are very well shot and extenuate how daring these events must be for a mouse like Stuart. As I said at the beginning of this review Stuart little was nominated for an Oscar for best visual effects, how this wasn't for best original score, I don't know but considering the other two films nominated for best visual effects were the Matrix and Star Wars Episode One: The Phantom Menace, I think the film got overshadowed by those two films but I do think the CGI for Stuart has held up incredibly well and considering the Film came out over 16 years ago, the Oscar nomination is well deserved and plus id rather take Stuart Little any day over, Jar ,Jar Binks. Cons: Some of the dialogue is also a bit odd, like there's this scene when Mr little and George are preparing their boat for the Central Park Boat Race. George is unsure about the boat race and Mr Little asks if George is okay and George says he wants to go home. Mr little asks 'why' and George says 'I forgot to bring my lucky underwear, Mr little replies'you don't have lucky underwear' but George replies with 'well maybe we should get some and then come back for another race'. What? I don't know whether that was meant to be funny but to me at least it's a very strange piece of dialogue but then again this movie was written by M. Night Shyamalan so I shouldn't really be surprised one bit.I'm also not sure how close the movie follows the original novel and keep in mind that I haven't read the novel and I have heard that the worthy follow up Stuart Little 2 follows more closely to the original novel than the first film. I heard in the original novel that Stuart got caught in a window-blind while exercising, and then Snowbell places Stuart's hat and cane outside a rat hole, panicking the family. I believe they may have replaced this scene with the one from first film in which Stuart is accidentally thrown into the washing machine although the Central Park Boat Race is in the original novel. I think the biggest complaint that this film gets quiet often is how unbelievable it is because well, how can a mouse walk around New York without being stepped on by the foot of a human. How can you adopt a mouse as your son and take him home on the same day, how come cars and boats are operational with inner working parts without the use of an RC steering wheel, and Batteries. You really do have to go into this film with as much suspension of disbelief as possible; otherwise you'll probably hate this Movie for how unbelievable it is. Final Verdict: Overall I think Stuart little is a good movie for all the family. Although the film takes some liberates with adapting the film from the novel and the dialogue is a bit odd, the excellent voice and on screen performances, Incredible score by Alan Silvestri and amazing special affects make this film stand out over other family films, the film has also in my opinion has held up surprisingly well after the film was released 16 years ago, in my opinion Stuart Little gets an Seven out of ten",Stuart Little
