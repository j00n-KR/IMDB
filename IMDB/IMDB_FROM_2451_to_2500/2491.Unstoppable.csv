0,Leofwine_draca,Great swansong from Tony Scott,7,7 May 2013,"UNSTOPPABLE, Tony Scott's final movie before his suicide, is a great swansong from the director. It's very much in the spirit of his previous output, in that it's a straightforward action-thriller, stylish, fast-paced and entertaining. It's very much like SPEED but without all that 1990s-era cheesiness that has dated that movieOf course, runaway train movies are nothing new, but this one ticks all the boxes. It has interesting central characters (Denzel Washington can near enough sleepwalk through these parts now, but that doesn't make his acting any the less enthralling, while Chris Pine is much better than he was in the overrated STAR TREK) and a dynamic relationship filled with realistic repartee. There's a high level of engaging technical detail that makes the plot feel true to life, despite the bombastic nature of its more out-there action bits.Strip away any kind of sentimentality, add in a pulsing soundtrack and some great set-pieces, throw in plenty of suspense and tension and top it all with Tony Scott's dynamic direction....yeah, I think this is one of his best, up there with ENEMY OF THE STATE and CRIMSON TIDE, and much better than the slightly lacklustre TAKING OF PELHAM 123 remake which preceded it.",Unstoppable
1,SnoopyStyle,Solid train action,7,25 December 2013,"Will (Chris Pine) is a new engineer, and Frank (Denzel Washington) is a veteran driver. After some incompetence, a big train gets loose and runs away. Will and Frank try to chase down the train with their own locomotive.It is a simple action thriller. Director Tony Scott is an expert in the action genre, and he puts all his skills to work here. There is a lot of fun train action going on in this movie. The CGI is pretty good, and blends in very well with the real world. There is some character background stories, but they're just the side dish. The main course is the action, and it's one continuous series of action scenes after a quick intro.",Unstoppable
2,Prismark10,Runaway train,6,6 December 2013,"Unstoppable turned out to be the last collaboration between director Tony Scott and actor Denzel Washington. Tony Scott died in 2012 and he was the go to guy whenever Washington wanted to make an action film.The film, loosely based on a real life incident, tells the story of an unmanned runaway freight train carrying dangerous chemicals and heading for a large town and a curvy track.Denzel Washington and Chris Pine must stop the train or slow it down before it hurts the curve and crashes.Unstoppable actually starts out rather comedic enough when two inept hostlers move the freight train and mess it up leading to chaos.Pine is the new newly hired conductor who aids Washington. Rosario Dawson is the person back at the depot who has to lead operations and battle her boss who is thinking about the effect this will have for his company's bottom line.Scott is the type of director who learned how to deliver such an action film. He did have a few duds in his time. The story might be a little dicey here and there but he gives us a well paced solid thriller.",Unstoppable
3,claudio_carvalho,Unstoppable Action,7,30 September 2015,"In Pennsylvania, one engineer is maneuvering a train in the yard and accidentally leaves the train operating without the pneumatic brakes engaged. The operation department initially believes it is a coaster but soon the operators realize that the unmanned train is running on full power. Further, it is carrying dangerous chemicals and diesel in the cargo wagons. There are many unsuccessful attempts to stop the runaway train and the veteran engineer Frank Barnes (Denzel Washington) and the young conductor Will Colson (Chris Pine) decide to take the chance to reduce the speed of the train with the most unlikely operation.The farewell of the brilliant director Tony Scott is a thriller with non- stop action inspired in a true event in Ohio. The screenplay is engaging and the dramatization is adequate to the story. The great cast with Denzel Washington, Chris Pine and Rosario Dawson completes this excellent entertainment. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Incontrolável"" (""Uncontrollable"")",Unstoppable
4,kosmasp,(Top?) Speed,6,31 December 2010,"Could it be, that Tony Scott and Denzel Washington would really make two train movies back to back? Well they seem to feel comfortable, so why should we bother. Not even the ridiculous plot will stop them (no pun intended for the rest of this review) nor the fact that a similar thing was handled as a short segment in the latest Renny Harlin movie (12 Rounds)! But you will get exactly what you can and should expect of a Tony Scott movie these days. From (simple) dialog to fancy editing/cutting and camera movements. It's all there. Chris Pine and Denzel almost feel over-casted/qualified, but hey as long as they're having fun, we can have fun too. Especially since this is a far better affair then Pelham 1 2 3 ...",Unstoppable
5,jboothmillard,Unstoppable,4,11 December 2010,"I saw the trailer for this film and thought, it's Speed 3 without a mad villain, and it was apparently based on real events, so I decided I'd hope for the best, from director Tony Scott (Top Gun, True Romance). Basically, in Stanton, Pennsylvania, Will Colson (Chris Pine) is starting his day at work as a train conductor, working for the first time alongside engineer Frank Barnes (Denzel Washington). Meanwhile, miles away in Fuller, on the same connecting line, is freight train locomotive #777, or Triple Seven, with air hoses disconnected, is being moved for a schoolchildren's excursion train. Hostler Dewey (Ethan Suplee) puts the lever on manual break and hurries his job, but he did not push the lever properly, and the train starts racing away unmanned with only manual breaking able to stop it. It appeared that the train was going at a relatively slow pace, but yardmaster Connie Hooper (Rosario Dawson) confirms that it is actually picking up speed, and worst is what is at the back. The train is carrying a cargo of toxic chemicals that if spilt could decimate an entire town, and they have to make sure that it can't go any further than the miles of countryside before the big town of Stanton. Of course Frank and Will on the same line are heading straight for the Chrysler Building size missile, and they have to think fast to get off the line and let it pass until a solution is found. The train line authorities try to drop a man onto the moving train via helicopter which makes a casualty, they try slowly it down with a train in front via breaking which fails, and after allowing it to pass Frank and Will are going after it. Despite the disapproval of Connie's superior Oscar Galvin (Kevin Dunn) on the intentions of stopping the train, Frank and Will are connecting their train to the back of Triple Seven to reverse and slow it. In the end, after a near catastrophe passing through Stanton, the train is eventually slowed down, an injured Will and Frank are praised as heroes. Also starring Kevin Corrigan as Inspector Werner, Kevin Chapman as Bunny, Lew Temple as Ned Oldman, T.J. Miller as Gilleece and Jessy Schram as Darcy Colson. Washington was alright, as were the supporting members of cast, but with the cheesy dialogue in amongst danger, and a bit of a slow pace, including the train looking not as fast in moments as it is meant to be, I just didn't think it was that gripping, but not a terrible action thriller. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Sound Editing. Okay!",Unstoppable
6,Woodyanders,"A tight, gripping, and rousing thriller",8,4 September 2012,"An unmanned runaway train transporting lethal toxic chemicals hurtles towards Scranton, Pennsylvania. It's up to shrewd veteran engineer Frank (an excellent and convincing performance by Denzel Washington) and eager rookie conductor Will (a fine and likable portrayal by Chris Pine) to stop the out-of-control behemoth before it's too late. Director Tony Scott, working from a compact script by Mark Bomback, relates the absorbing story at a nonstop swift pace, generates plenty of heart-pounding tension, puts his trademark hyper-kinetic style to remarkably effective and appropriate use (for once, Scott's penchant for fast cuts and a constantly moving camera fit the subject matter and neatly convey the harrowing headlong momentum of the seemingly unstoppable train), and stages the rip-roaring action with tremendously stirring go-for-broke skill and brio. The sound acting from the capable cast keeps the picture on track: Washington and Pine strike up a strong, engaging, and pleasingly adversarial chemistry in the lead roles, with sturdy support from Rosario Dawson as no-nonsense train dispatcher Connie, Kevin Dunn as huffy train company vice president Oscar Galvin, Kevin Corrigan as brainy and helpful train safety expert Scott Werner, Lew Temple as cowboy thrill junkie Ned Oldham, Ethan Suplee as bumbling railroad worker Dewey, and David Warshofsky as seasoned engineer Judd Stewart. Moreover, the taut 98 minute running time ensures that the movie never gets dull or overstays its welcome, the CGI effects are kept to a refreshing minimum, and the stunts are done with breathtaking flair and agility. Ben Sevesin's lively'n'glossy cinematography and Harry Gregson-Williams' frantic rattling score further enhance the nerve-jangling intensity and excitement of this on the money nail-biter.",Unstoppable
7,rmax304823,A Mile A Minute.,6,1 September 2011,"A long train with a load of toxic chemicals is moving slowly through the yard. The sole person on board temporarily steps off to change a switch manually. A cog slips in the locomotive's compartment and the train speeds out of the yard on its own, leaving the panting engineer behind. The train is a monster of inertia. It's at maximum speed, it's carrying enough poison to kill an entire city, and it's on its own trip.Will its speed derail it at ""Stanton, Pennsylvania"" and will its tanker cars pile into the tanks full of fuel at the sharp curve there? Or will seasoned engineer Denzel Washington and his new intern, Chris Pine, somehow catch up and bring it to a safe halt? It's interesting to compare two vaguely similar movies. Konchalovsky's ""Runaway Train"" is a study of character. Three people are on board an unmanned train zipping along at seventy miles per hour towards a dead end. They can't reach the lead locomotive.""Unstoppable"" is a commercially oriented action movie, probably based on ""Speed"", in which everything is overplayed, always in motion, including the camera, which wobbles all over, and the images, which are sometimes a second or two long.The director here is Tony Scott and the writer is Mark Bomback and they know how to put together a tense winner that grips the viewer and has no depth whatever. There's probably as much action in one movie as in the other. In fact, one of the incidents -- the runaway train clipping off the last car of another train that's entering a siding -- is almost identical.But ""Unstoppable"" is predictable in almost every way. We know Washington and Pine will succeed, just as we knew Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock would live through ""Speed."" The chase in ""Unstoppable"" is covered by television helicopters, to which the camera cuts from time to time in order to add more noise and action, although it may not be relevant.In ""Runaway Train"" only a handful of office workers argued and hovered over their computers, debating how to stop the thing. In ""Unstoppable,"" there are multiple reaction shots of people screaming, of nervous wives biting their lips to keep back the sobs, of Washington's daughters dressed as cheerleaders and leaping up and down. There is also Rosario Dawson glamorized, which is a nice touch, but ""Runaway Train"" only had a frostbitten Rebecca De Mornay dressed in raggedy winter clothing. The treatment of the two women is emblematic of the differences between the two films.Not to put this one down just because it's a strictly commercial effort whose only aim is to make money by grabbing the viewer by the shoulders and shaking him back and forth. The clichés work. That's why they're clichés. They've always worked before.It's just that ""Unstoppable"" leaves you with a feeling of relief and a pounding heart. ""Runaway Train"" gets the same job done but you think about it afterward. If you miss ""Unstoppable,"" well, you can rent ""Speed"" or ""Siege II"" or any one of a number of other action movies. You can't simply go out and rent a simulacrum of ""Runaway Train"" because there is none.",Unstoppable
8,Tweekums,Can Denzel Washington and Chris Pine stop a runaway train?,8,18 May 2016,"The plot of this film is simple but highly effective; a driver shunting freight train 777 leaves the locomotive to change the points ahead of the train. While he is off the engine a control slips and the train powers out of the yard and onto the main line. The first concern is a train carrying school children but that is moved out of the way in the nick of time. The next worry is a freight train controlled by driver Frank Barnes and conductor Will Colson; it is heading towards 777 and it is uncertain whether they will be able to get to a sufficiently long siding before a collision occurs. As these trains head together the railway company attempts to stop 777 by positioning a locomotive in front of it and gradually slowing it to a speed where a driver can be lowered onto 777 from a helicopter a plan that ends in disaster and doesn't stop 777. Frank and Will get to the siding just in time and after 777 passes Frank comes up with a plan; they will disconnect from their train, pursue 777 from behind and then attach to it before attempting to bring it to a halt. To make matters worse 777 is carrying volatile, toxic chemicals and is head towards a very sharp bend in the middle of the town of Stanton it is travelling at 70MPH and the safe speed limit is 15MPH!I hadn't heard of this film before picking it up but figured it couldn't be too bad if it starred Denzel Washington and was directed by Tony Scott I wasn't wrong in my assumption. The drama starts quickly and the tension is maintained from the moment 777 runs away till the gripping finale. If it wasn't for the fact that this was inspired by a real event it would be hard to believe that it was possible for train to run away like this let alone be caught and stopped by a pursuing locomotive. There is a slightly tagged on plot whereby the company refuse to derail the train, before the attempt to get a driver on board, for financial reasons is a bit unnecessary but doesn't detract from the drama. Denzel Washington and Chris Pine do impressive jobs as Barnes and Colson; this is very much their film. As one would expect from director Tony Scott the action is dramatic and looks very real with the possible exception of when the train tilted while doing round a very sharp bend; not something that could have been safely done without special effects! Overall I'd heartily recommend this; I was gripped from start to finish.",Unstoppable

10,BA_Harrison,Feels more like an ambitious TV movie than a big-budget blockbuster.,5,22 March 2015,"Inspired by true events, Unstoppable, director Tony Scott's final movie, stars Denzel Washington and Chris Pine as the veteran driver and rookie conductor of a freight locomotive, who, having narrowly avoided a head on collision with a driver-less, runaway train carrying toxic chemicals, decide to give chase in the hope of slowing the vehicle down and averting a major disaster.This could have been a really solid action film—it certainly had a decent sized budget and star power—but the tedious script bogs down the action with unnecessary technical details and dull character development, while Scott's trademark directorial style—frenetic camera-work, crash zooms and rapid editing—does little to convince that the film's runaway train is genuinely hurtling along at a breakneck speed: for much of the time, it looks like it's travelling at a fairly leisurely pace. For an action movie, there's very little in the way of genuine thrills; for the most part, Unstoppable feels more like an ambitious TV movie than a big-budget blockbuster from a major director.",Unstoppable
11,blanche-2,Exciting,7,7 May 2011,"Denzel Washington and Chris Pine chase a train carrying dangerous substances that is ""Unstoppable,"" a 2010 film directed by Tony Scott.This is a well-done film with some very exciting sequences. However, it's basically an action movie template where you just insert, say, a bus, a train, an airplane, a car, a ship, a shark, and go from there. Washington plays Frank, the old guard of the railroad who at first resents the young Will (Pine) to whom he's assigned to work that day. Will has been hit with a restraining order by his wife and is attempting to fight it. It turns out that Will and Frank on the same track as a train that the conductor jumped out of, and it's out of control. Management consistently makes the wrong decisions, to the chagrin of Connie (Rosario Dawson) who is in the control room trying to get other trains off the tracks. Then Frank gets an idea that, if it works, could save the day.Very derivative, but the action sequences are top-notch. There at least was an attempt to flesh out the main characters, unlike ""Poseidon."" Thanks to Washington and Pine, they are very likable.",Unstoppable
12,Quinoa1984,"as long as you aren't looking for things like story and character, it's fun, I guess",5,22 November 2010,"Tony Scott isn't known for subtlety. So maybe then he is one of the only people conceivable right now in Hollywood to make a big-loud- somewhat-stupid runaway train movie. This isn't 1985 where one could get a director with a slightly-less ""Hollywood"" sensibility like Andrei Konchovalesky to make his Runaway Train (albeit a screenplay by Kurosawa doesn't hurt). It's a movie where Scott favors kinetic-speed of shots and cuts over substance. The average shot-speed doesn't last longer than maybe two seconds, though there may be some leeway to a longer- length shot depending on how long Scott is doing another in his (I'm not sure I'm kidding) 100+ shots where it's just a pan around a talking head. Who needs a simple static shot in a Tony Scott movie, those are friggin' boring! Let's get some action and fast-pace there, even when the train is... not moving at 70 MPH until the last half hour of the movie.The one plus side for Scott is that in a sense he's making a monster movie as much as he's making Speed-on-railroad tracks. There's a moment where Ethan Suplee, who plays a hapless railroad worker, can't catch up to the train he let go on its own and we see what's inside the train: no conductor, and the level pulls itself into its too-friggin-fast position. Oh, and it's 38 cars long of hazardous chemicals that we're reminded of periodically in the movie is like ""a missile"". So it's almost as if it's like stopping a Japanese monster ala Rodan or something, and in this sense the lack of characters here- nay, seemingly much less than the even thin previous Scott-Denzel movie Pelham 123- might make some sense.While I could be engaged with the movie on a superficial level, there wasn't anything at the kind of stakes-level or with the clever-kinetic script like a Speed or had the cheesy fun of a Godzilla movie. The trailer with its over-the-top hysterics of a train full of little kids on a field trip and some of the juicier bits between Washington and co- star Chris Pine give an indication that it'll be very dumb-fun. As it turns out it's just a dumb-action movie that has the kind of 'fun' level of too-cool-for-school dialog bits. There's nothing here that is really interesting except that it's a train on the loose and about to demolish a Pennsylvania town of a little under a million people. There are a few moments late in the game when our two Hollywood heroes (one young one near retirement as we're told early on) can stop the train, and it's here that Scott and his writer slips: where's the danger in the stakes really getting raised or someone (spoiler) getting hurt? It's loud dumb spectacle, but maybe that will work for some less-high- hope viewers. I don't know, maybe it was just a simple work-for-hire on Scott's end, but it could have been something a little better if he had given more for his main actors to do than spout off ""Train's going 45 miles, blah blah, two daughters, blah blah, ex-wife, blah blah"" type dialog. And as a B-movie it only works adequately in that there is some tension in the final twenty minutes as to what will be the extent of the train damage on the surrounding areas... on the other hand, what damage? Scott's compensation for what is mostly a slow-moving train (you'll drive faster to the theater to see it than the actual train goes) is a lot of his trademark fast-visuals (whiplash style editing and so many pans as to tire out dolly tracks), even when it's a simple scene like the very ending. Sometimes, even with a disaster movie, too much can be TOO much. At least it's not as exasperating as Domino.",Unstoppable
13,Coventry,Runaway Train never going back...,7,28 October 2020,"Tony Scott's ""Unstoppable"" is one of my favorite and most frequently viewed films since the year 2000. Not necessarily because it's so great or unique, but simply because it reminds me of those delicious disaster movies from 70s and early 80s. ""Why Unstoppable?"", I hear you say, ""because there still are loads of modern disaster movies being made in Hollywood"". True that, but I'm allergic to the massively exaggerated and 100% digitally accomplished ""everything-must-be-destroyed"" movies like ""2012"", ""The Day After Tomorrow"" or ""San Andreas"". ""Unstoppable"" at least features some good old-fashioned stunt work, remote-operated train cars and risky camera angles. To review the classic disaster movies of the 70s and 80s, I used a self-invented and five-point entertainment scale. Let's check if it's still applicable!#1: without producer Irwin Allen, there wasn't a budget for special effects and thus no movie. Well, the legendary Irwin ""Master of Disaster"" Allen passed away in 1991 already, so he doesn't do a lot of producing anymore. Still, with a budget of more than 100 million, great things can be realized. Point earned! #2: all disaster movies star one major star (especially Charlton Heston and Paul Newman were prime choices) and a long list of ""secondary"" stars (like Ernest Borgnine, Leslie Nielsen,). Check! Although, evidently, the stardom names have altered. Denzel Washington definitely qualifies as a major star, Chris Pine was quite the rising star in 2010, and the supportive cast list is impressive to say the least (Rosario Dawson, Lew Temple, Kevin Dunn, Ethan Suplee, ...). Point earned! #3: The characters are usually split into two camps with completely opposite ideals and/or initiatives. The camp with the lead star is obviously the triumphant camp. With a bit of imagination, yes, definitely! Kevin Dunn depicts the arrogant railway tycoon who stubbornly refuses to accept that a massive disaster can still be avoided. He's also the heartless CEO who bluntly fires veteran engineers with 30 years of service. #4: Regardless what type of disaster we're dealing with, variants of the exact same perilous situations are always applicable. Of course, like any good disaster movie demands, there's an entire school bus with happily singing children in danger. There are more delightful clichés, like the young hero struggling with a marriage crisis and a helicopter crash, but the bus full of children says enough. #5: always remember that, when the situation appears to be at its worst, it can and will still get even worse! Well duh, not only is the train unstoppable, it's heading straight for an impossible curve, above ground and threatening to crash straight into chock-full fuel depots! Moreover, there isn't any time to evacuate the minimally 20,000 inhabitants of the Pennsylvanian city! It's doesn't get more disastrous, me thinks!Well, what do you know! ""Unstoppable"" scores 5 out of 5 on the rating scale for disaster movies. What does that mean? Absolutely nothing, expect that it guarantees great entertainment.",Unstoppable

16,hitchcockthelegend,Tony and Denzel get back on track.,8,7 March 2011,"Unstoppable is directed by Tony Scott and written by Mark Bomback. It stars Denzel Washington, Chris Pine, Rosario Dawson, Ethan Suplee & Kevin Dunn. Cinematographer is Ben Seresin and the music is scored by Harry Gregson-Williams. Plot finds Washington and Pine as Pennsylvania rail yard workers at the opposite ends of their working careers. Whilst working on their first job together, and not exactly hitting it off, the two men are thrust into a frantic pursuit of a runaway train. The runaway (coaster) is pulling tankers containing highly explosive material, and hurtling along at 70mph it has to be stopped before it hits civilisation.Almost as if to atone for the misfire that was The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3, Scott and Washington jump on board another type of train movie and literally let it rip. The film is as simple as its plot synopsis suggests, it's a disaster movie on the railway, but with Scott cranking it up as much as he can, it's as much fun as you can hope to have with a modern day popcorner. Carrying all the trade mark licks of its director; roving camera, scattergun editing and ear splitting sound mix, it's also nice to report that unlike Pelham, the pace never sags. Even as the principal characters hang ups and back stories are unfolded in the narrative, Unstoppable literally doesn't pause for breath. Sure the ""Bromance"" development is signposted at the first stop, and yes, are we ever in doubt about where this will end up? But if you are going into Unstoppable for wry social commentary or an expose on the political shenanigans involved in today's rail yards? Well you deserve all the disappointment you will undoubtedly get.A runaway train pursued by Captain Kirk and Malcolm X, directed by the man who brought us Top Gun. Yeah baby, it's a thrill ride for sure. 8/10",Unstoppable
17,Theo Robertson,Pelham 123 On A Moving Train,4,24 February 2013,"There's a couple of major warning signs about this movie . One is Denzil Washington and the other is director Tony Scott . Add to this a premise about a train being out of control and you're led to think that you might be watching a dumb , noisy film with a gossamer thin plot featuring lots of camera work featuring ramping , subliminal cross cutting , crash zoom lens camera work and lots of scenes set in a railway control room along with a garish colour clash look to the film . Guess what you get with UNSTOPPABLE ? Hey you've seen it too . Strange that I could have written this paragraph without actually seeing the movie because I've seen it and this paragraph sums up this predictable film perfectly . Perhaps the most apt description I can give it is THE TAKING OF PELHAM 123 set on a moving train When you watch a movie you have to suspend a lot of disbelief . I've never worked on a railway but aren't there all these safety procedures that are totally full proof that stop the type of scenario seen here ? I'm pretty sure if I spent less than ten minutes on wikipedia I could make a long list of things I could post on the goof sections but I've got a feeling a massive amount of people have already beaten me to it Did I say this movie reminded me of the vapid disappointing remake of THE TAKING OF PELHAM 123 ? One wonders why a year after making it both the star and director felt the need to make another film featuring a train with the action inter-cutting to a railway control room . You might say at least UNSTOPPABLE features a moving high speed train unlike the static subway train of the 2009 movie but is this strictly true ? Look at the number of exciting high speed scenes where it's painfully obvious that the train itself can't be going much faster than jogging speed ! To be honest what'd you need Denzil Washington for when the average obese American could run alongside the train , squeeze in to the cab and apply the brakes thereby saving a city from disaster and the audience from getting a headache",Unstoppable
18,Scarecrow-88,Unstoppable,7,24 September 2011,"With three weeks left before forced retirement, veteran engineer (and widower, losing his wife to cancer) Frank (Denzel Washington) and newly appointed conductor Will Colson(Chris Pike), with domestic issues, have the unfortunate task of stopping a speeding runaway train (that became unmanned out of the irresponsibility and stupidity of the person operating it; not to mention, the train's cargo is diesel fuel and toxic chemicals) when other strategies ( such as Judd Stewart (David Warshofsky) trying to use his train to slow it down so a man could land on top of it as to board the train and another attempt to derail it in a Pennsylvanian small town of Arklow) fail to halt it. There is a command center (controlled by Connie (Rosario Dawson), with the intellectual mind of Inspector Werner (Kevin Corrigan) also helping her come up with plans and advice to help Frank and Will) and the boardroom, helmed by Vice President Galvin (Kevin Dunn), who try to come up with answers to stop the damn locomotive on a course to Stanton where fuel containers await a long curving track. The runaway train cannot move around the rail of this curving track at a speed under 20 or so miles an hour so it is imperative that Frank and Will perform a miracle to slow it. The plan Frank comes up with is to attach a single car train in reverse, pin it to the runaway train, and try to slow it down before Stanton. Will it work? That's what the movie will show. Despite director Tony Scott's usual editing and camera shenanigans (he just can't help himself), the pace never lags and the story is thrilling and exciting. While we can predict the outcome, the film still manages to grip you, mainly because the situation is a real scary one. Washington never fails to give a first-rate performance and works his ass off for Scott time and again. Pine has that rugged handsome look that seems ideal for his blue-collar character, given a chance at some real heroics; Will is also a flawed person who has made his share of mistakes regarding his wife and the faulty belief in her infidelity. The intensity of this movie's scenario is always present; the runaway train is always represented as a monster on its way to destroy anything in its path. The miscommunication (or lack thereof) between Galvin and those in the command center is especially shown, with Frank and Will forced into surrendering their careers it seems if they disobey a direct order not to interfere with a derailment strategy. You see how two minds, when focused on the objective, not wavering because of fear, can come together and get a job done despite the intimidating obstacles before them.",Unstoppable
19,Hey_Sweden,Just about perfect as far as escapism goes.,9,2 February 2013,"""Unstoppable"" is as good as Big Hollywood Entertainment gets. With an accomplished director at this sort of thing, in the form of Tony Scott, a veteran acting pro such as Denzel Washington in one of the leads, and a solid premise, this is one of those movies that actually delivers the goods and keeps you hanging on the edge of your seat throughout. Masterfully crafted, it recalls such earlier films as ""Runaway Train"" and ""Speed"", but is actually inspired by a true story.Taking place in Pennsylvania, it tells the tale of an unmanned train barrelling through the country, a train that also happens to be carrying a dangerous chemical. The heroes of the day turn out to be a veteran engineer, Frank (Denzel), and a rookie conductor, Will (Chris Pine). They're out on their first assignment together, and Frank realizes it's within their power to do whatever it takes to shut down the train.This being a Hollywood production, of course, it's never exactly going to be subtle, but who would watch such a film as ""Unstoppable"" and expect such a thing? It's a thrill ride, first and foremost, but it does have some good, solid human moments along the way as we get to know Frank and Will. The many efforts of assorted railway employees also add to the escalating drama, with some people keeping cooler heads than others and making smarter decisions. The action scenes are technically first rate, with some wonderful eye popping photography. And just to make sure the attention of some viewers doesn't ever wander too much, there are assorted scenes of explosions and trains crashing through obstacles.An excellent supporting cast backs up the stars: Rosario Dawson, Ethan Suplee, Kevin Dunn, Kevin Corrigan, Lew Temple, T.J. Miller, and David Warshofsky, with Dawson shining as one of the cooler heads.In the end, the movie is a fine testament to courage and commitment, in the face of human error. Text at the end of the movie proper and before the end credits reveals the fate of a couple of the key players.Nine out of 10.",Unstoppable
20,CinemaSerf,Superior and quite compelling thriller.,7,17 November 2021,"Ok, so the beginning of this is a bit hard to believe. A combination of stupidity, laziness and negligence leads to a 20-car freight train running out of control in Pennsylvania. Luckily, veteran engineer ""Frank"" (Denzel Washington) and rookie conductor ""Will"" (Chris Pine) are on another train and they might just be able to stop this rogue one before it hits a fuel depot and kills thousands of people. Tony Scott builds the tension well, the pace builds and is sustained as our gallant pair risk life and limb to stop the thing. The photography is effectively tight and the score works well to keep that sense of peril working too. Maybe there isn't really much jeopardy, as such, but I did find myself getting drawn into their efforts and caring what happens next. It takes a little bit of a swipe at Corporate prioritising too, but is essentially a testament to the men who were prepared to put the safety of others before themselves, and both lead actors are on good form.",Unstoppable
21,zardoz-13,An Old-Fashioned Thriller About A Runaway Train,9,22 November 2010,"""Top Gun"" director Tony Scott's runaway train thriller ""Unstoppable"" qualifies as a gripping, white-knuckled, buddy picture. Denzel Washington and Chris Pine are cast respectively as a veteran train engineer and a newbie conductor. Clocking in at 98 spine-tingling minutes, this suspenseful, straightforward juggernaut of a movie neither sacrifices narrative momentum for needless exposition nor wears out its welcome with too many disaster scenes. Contrived but compelling is the best way to summarize ""Unstoppable."" Scott and ""Live Free or Die Hard"" scenarist Martin Bomback drew their inspiration from an actual case, the 2001 ""Crazy Eights"" case, about a train without an engineer that trundled some 66 miles from Toledo, Ohio, to Kenton, Ohio. Initially, the ""Crazy Eights"" engineer jumped out of the locomotive to line up a switch in the rail yard. Before he jumped off, he thought he had set the dynamic braking system. Unfortunately, the dynamic brake disengaged, and the train gathered speed and left him. Predictably, Twentieth Century Fox and Scott have taken the usual liberties. Not only have they hiked the train speed to over 70 mph, far above the actual train's 47 mph, but Scott and Bomback have also added eight tanker cars with combustible material. One ""Unstoppable"" character describes the predicament that the state of Pennsylvania faces: ""We're not just talking about a train. We're talking about a missile the size of the Chrysler Building!"" Indeed, the train consists of 39 cars. Nevertheless, were it not for the actual case, ""Unstoppable"" would generate little credibility. For the record, director Andrei Konchalovsky's film ""Runaway Train"" (1985) concerned two prisoners who broke out of Alaska's Stonehaven Prison and smuggled themselves aboard a train. What they didn't know was that the train had no brakes and the engineer died just as the train pulled out of the station.""Unstoppable"" opens with one of our blue-collar heroes, Will Colson (Chris Pine of ""Star Trek""), trying to reunite with his wife Darcy (Jessy Schram of ""American Pie Presents The Naked Mile"") and his young son. As it turns out, Darcy and Will are struggling with marital woes. Darcy has signed a restraining order against Will so he has to live with his brother Jesse Colson (Jeff Wincott of ""Mission of Justice""). Meantime, Will reports to the railroad yard to serve as the conductor on the train that 28-year railway veteran Frank Barnes (Denzel Washington of ""Remember the Titans"") will be driving. Barnes is a widower with two daughters working their way through college by waiting tables at Hooters. Essentially, all Barnes and Will have to do is shuttle freight cars to a different location. In faraway railway yard, Dewey (Ethan Suplee of ""American History X"") is switching a train onto a different track. Foolishly, this clown jumps off the train so that he can move a lever and switch the train to another track. What Dewey doesn't know is that the brake has slipped out of gear. Before he realizes it, the train has picked up enough speed so he cannot get back on it. Later, Dewey and his goof-off friend try to board the train by racing alongside it. Miles away Frank and Will get the surprise of their lives when the dispatcher informs them they are set to collide with a rogue train. Miraculously, Frank and Will beat the runaway train to a siding. The rampaging train smashes through some of the freight cars that Frank and Will were towing. When Frank learns that corporate plans to use a derailing device, he predicts failure but comes up with an idea just about as harebrained. He plans to increase the speed of his locomotive, catch up with the rogue train, and lock onto it from the rear. Afterward, he plans to slow its rate of speed until somebody can climb into the engine cab. Initially, Galvin (Kevin Dunn of ""Transformers"") rules Frank's plan out and warns that he will fire him. Frank reminds Galvin that he has already fired him and that he has only two weeks left on his contract. Meantime, Frank convinces a reluctant Will to help him, and the two men become media superstars as the news choppers and reporters broadcast their efforts. In an age marked by callous corporate strategy, ""Unstoppable"" pays tribute to blue-collar professionals who save the day after their superiors have bungled everything. You'll find yourself rooting not only for Denzel and company, but also for rail dispatcher Rosario Dawson when she joins them. As the welder who tries to catch up with train, Lew Temple completes the quartet that wants to halt the rogue train. Kevin Dunn is perfect as an unsympathetic, narrow-minded white-collar type.""Unstoppable"" gradually builds up a full head of steam in the first 30-minutes. Shrewdly, Scott and Bomback release the exposition—important information that the characters already know that we don't know—like a time-lapse capsule. They foreshadow the future, shade in the sketchy characters, and turn both our heroes into sympathetic characters. By the time ""Unstoppable"" grinds to a stop, we know everything about our heroes and the plot. During the last 30-minutes, your hands will be knuckled up into fists, and you'll be on the edge of your seat. Furthermore, Scott has surrounded Denzel and Pine with a convincing cast, including Ethan Suplee, Kevin Dunn, and martial arts star Jeff Wincott. Scott and Bomback constantly goose the narrative to generate more urgency. One of their prime methods is the media coverage. A number of TV reporters appear in emergency flash bulletins, and these updates intensify the drama. At the same time, ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"" lenser Ben Seresin sucks us into the vortex of the action with his hyper-kinetic cinematography. People who suffer from motion sickness may want to clutch their popcorn bags. Scott and Seresin keep things whirling even when they shift the action away from the train and into the railway offices. ""Unstoppable"" is a haul of a movie!",Unstoppable
22,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"The film *is* a bomb! Uh, I mean, the train is",7,12 November 2010,"When an unmanned train carrying toxic and explosive chemicals is headed at a high speed towards residential areas, it's up to a veteran engineer(Washington) and a rookie conductor(Pine) to try to stop it and save hundreds of thousands of lives. Not original(how many disaster flicks are, really?) and frankly, this could easily be a really cheesy B-movie. Not unlike the Pelham remake Tony did... and yet again, it's about a train... last time, it was one that stopped moving when it shouldn't have, this time, it's about one that keeps moving when it shouldn't. You know, I'm starting to wonder if he just uses public transportation a lot and gets these ideas when the line breaks down or when the train leaves too early and he misses it or something. Anyway, this does take itself seriously, and it's frankly quite gripping. It feels realistic, and it's easy to get into. Yes, it's pure Hollywood, very straightforward and it is not likely to stay with you for long once the end credits roll. But it's an intense and exciting 100 minutes. It may not do well, though... I went to catch it on what I'm pretty sure is the day after the premiere, and I constituted a third of the audience, as far as I could tell. This is genuinely funny, and the dialog is mostly good. The characters aren't bad, if the two leads' backstories really don't have the impact they should. Acting is great. Everyone is well-cast(meanwhile, does Dunn ever play something other than a jerk who stays with procedure and can't see the big picture?). The script is fine. Not everyone will love the cinematography... if you've seen other recent works by Scott, you almost know what to expect: Many little zooms, what feels like constant movement to it... he doesn't do the washed out color that he went nuts with in Man on Fire and seemingly Domino(haven't watched it) all the time in this. You feel the weight of the trains, if the camera is shoved right up to and/or under them a tad often. The editing largely works out well, if a couple of things are sped up unnecessarily. Oh, and there are *tons* of reaction shots. Something that bothered me about this was how the news stations somehow always know what's going on... I don't know if it was felt that we wouldn't be able to keep track of what was going on if they didn't tell us what we're seeing so much of the time, and anyway, there is no way they could know all the time. There is a little disturbing content and moderate to strong language in this. I recommend it to any fan of this kind of feature. 7/10",Unstoppable

24,neil-476,"Exciting with annoying, ""But why?"" moments",8,12 December 2010,"Due to a series of mishaps, a huge train including large amounts of dangerous and toxic chemicals ends up running away, unmanned, at high speed and with its automatic brakes disconnected. Given that a wreck will devastate large areas of urban Pennsylvania, it's down to veteran railman Denzel Washington and new recruit Chris Pine to stop it, at great personal risk to themselves. In the course of this taking place, we also learn a little about their personal lives (which, of course, helps us to identify with them).Tony Scott's action thriller, (very) loosely based on real events, is absolutely by the numbers film making - every element serves a pre-determined purpose. There's nothing wrong with that, of course, and this film is genuinely exciting and involving.I suspect that if you are familiar with Pennsylvanian railroading you may find disbelief difficult to suspend at times and, even if you aren't, there are still moments which may cause you trouble. In particular: 1. The first attempt to stop the runaway - SPOILER AHEAD! - involved a) trying to slow it down by putting a braking loco in front of it, and b) lowering a bloke onto the runaway from a helicopter. Excuse me? What was wrong with having a driver climb from the braking loco directly onto the runaway, up the same steps that Pine eventually jumped onto from a truck travelling at over 70mph? 2. Why on earth would the idiot rail company executive (Sam Witwicki's Dad)(OK, Kevin Dunn) refuse the possibility of a backup plan? 3. I was interested to learn that Pennsylvania has its own language, in which the phrase ""evacuate, because a train loaded with toxic chemicals and explosives is likely to crash with disastrous consequences for the immediate area"" means ""Gather as many people as possible at the railroad tracks."" Also, Tony, the helicopter shots of the trains were great, but you really didn't have to do every interior shot with the camera dollying backwards and forwards - a static camera is OK sometimes, you know. At least it wasn't hand held nausea.I'm being a bit picky - this film was very entertaining.",Unstoppable

I wasn't expecting much of anything from this movie and yet it still somehow managed to fall short.

26,Uriah43,Off the Rails Excitement,7,18 July 2019,"This film begins in a northern Pennsylvania trainyard with a railroad employee by the name of ""Dewey"" (Ethan Suplee) disregarding advice by climbing down from a running locomotive with 39 attached cars in order to pull a railroad switch a little further up the line. Although he sets the independent air brake to keep the train from gaining speed, what he doesn't realize is that under the current situation the exact opposite would happen and before he realizes it the train has sped past him before he can reboard. To make matters worse, not only does this runaway train have some cars which contain a volatile chemical that would cause massive loss of life should the train derail near an urban population center, but with it's current rate-of-speed this is exactly what is predicted to happen when it reaches a bend in the tracks known as the Stanton Curve. Meanwhile, rather than listening to the advice of the yardmaster ""Connie Hooper"" (Rosario Dawson) to derail the train in a rural area, the arrogant Vice-President of Train Operations ""Oscar Galvin"" (Kevin Dunn) chooses a plan with a greater degree of risk but one which will also save the company from losing millions of dollars if successful. The problem is, that as the train gains even more momentum, he continues to resist all advice to the contrary-and a derailment at the Stanton Curve becomes even more certain. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that, although this film was ""inspired by true events"", the actual facts were clearly embellished to a great degree as well. But that's Hollywood for you. Even so, the action and suspense was definitely compelling and combined with the acting of Denzel Washington (as ""Frank Barnes""), Chris Pine (""Will Colson"") and the aforementioned Rosario Dawson the movie itself was quite entertaining.",Unstoppable
27,ferguson-6,A Yellow Vest No More,6,20 November 2010,"Greetings again from the darkness. Three things about the film are undeniable. One: A runaway train is fascinating and dangerous. Two: Director Tony Scott really likes working with Denzel Washington (this is their 5th movie together). Three: Inspired by a real life 2001 runaway train in Toledo, the story plays right into Mr. Scott's wheelhouse with action and testosterone.On the plus side, tension is rampant and the film does an adequate job of capturing the emotions from three different perspectives - inside a train (Denzel and Chris Pine), at command center (Rosario Dawson and staff) and at the corporate office (smarmy Kevin Dunn). We also see exactly how a simple poor decision by one major goofball (Ethan Suplee) can imperil thousands of people.Unfortunately, that's where the good news ends. The script is abysmal and the acting is not much better. Denzel sleepwalks through another textbook ""Denzel"" character. Rosario Dawson is given little to work with as the supervisor, and Kevin Dunn is way over the top as the corporate bad guy who is only worried about the hit to the stock price. There is even a ridiculous shot of the Chairman on a golf course, in case we viewers are too dumb to understand the perspective of the company. Chris Pine (Star Trek, Bottle Shock) is the only one who shows much, yet he still is given horrible dialogue to spout.For proof that an unstoppable train movie can be exhilarating AND well written, check out Andrey Konchalovskiy's 1985 ""Runaway Train"". Both Jon Voight and Eric Roberts received Oscar nominations. The psychological warfare in that one matched the breakneck pace of the train itself. Instead this film is written by Mark Bomback (Live Free and Die Hard) in such a one dimensional frame that it takes the news reports to remind us that real people are in danger.",Unstoppable
28,FlashCallahan,now you're blushing.....,8,1 December 2010,"so the plot is high concept.fat guy gets off a moving train to move it onto the right track, breaks come off, train gets faster and faster, with something quite sinister on board.Only captain Kirk and John Creasy can save the day.With a little help from Ned.....the film never lets up from the word go, and with Scott the younger at the helm, you know you are in safe hands. Whenever he makes a film with Washington, you can guarantee some kind of quality from it. Even these two made the remake of 123 passable stuff.The reason what this film works on so many levels is the humanistic element thrown into the works.Every character here has a flaw or something big going on in their lives, right down to good old Ned (who really saves the day in my opinion).Washington will lose his job in 21 days due to something not disclosed, and Pine is the golden boy, due to having family working at the top.The fact that this isn't really discussed into the final third makes the film better, as this doesn't make an excuse for them to be martyrs at all.Rosario Dawson is thrown into the mix to explain the plot to people and there is a little comic relief thrown in for good measure.It is exciting at times, and the last fifteen will have you on the edge of your seat, but the rest of the film is about characters bonding and getting rid of petty squabbles and personal problems to work together to save the day.The cinematography is beautifully done, and the action is thankfully old school, with Scott using CGI very lightly to give it a realistic feel.It's pretty throwaway stuff, but well worth seeing on the big screen with a packed screen.Feelgood film making at it's best.",Unstoppable
29,Wuchakk,"Suspenseful and believable runaway train flick, but lacks the depth of ""Runaway Train""",7,17 October 2015,"Released in 2010, ""Unstoppable"" is about a runaway train in Pennsylvania carrying toxic chemicals and the engineer and conductor who try to stop it (Denzel Washington & Chris Pine). Rosario Dawson plays the yardmaster that assists from headquarters while Jessy Schram plays the separated wife of the newbie conductor.The movie's based on the real-life CSX 8888 Incident, otherwise known as the Crazy Eights Incident, which involved a runaway freight train in northwestern Ohio in 2001. Locomotive #8888 was pulling 47 cars, including some with hazardous chemicals, and ran unmanned for two hours and 66 miles at speeds of up to 51 mph. (***Don't read the rest of this paragraph if you don't want to know how the real-life incident ended before seeing the movie***). Attempts to derail the train using a portable derailer failed, as did an attempt by police to shoot at an emergency fuel cutoff switch, which didn't work because the button has to be pressed for several seconds before the engine shuts down due to lack of fuel. A northbound freight train took succor in a siding area where the crew released its locomotive and waited for the runaway to pass. Like in the movie, they had a crew of two: Jess Knowlton, an engineer with 31 years of service; and Terry L. Forson, a relative neophyte conductor. They proceeded to chase the runaway train and successfully locked on to the rear car of the runaway, then slowing it by applying the dynamic brakes or their locomotive. Once the runaway had slowed to 11 miles per hour, trainmaster Jon Hosfeld ran alongside the train, jumped on, and shut down the engine.While the movie starts somewhat bland it quickly picks up momentum for a realistic non-stop thrill ride. The realism is refreshing in this day and age of cartoony action blockbusters and their multiple ""yeah, right"" action scenes (not that there's anything wrong with those movies, as long as you're in the right mode). Washington and Pine make for good protagonists and you start to care about them as the story progresses. Moreover, the movie doesn't overstay its welcome at a mere 98 minutes.The film was shot in numerous locations extending from central Pennsylvania to eastern Ohio, which serve up a nice rolling hills backdrop with the occasional river. Minor note: You'll observe a woodchuck scamper across the tracks in one scene where he/she thankfully DOESN'T become ground chuck.BOTTOM LINE: ""Unstoppable"" is worthwhile as a believable disaster thriller. While it lacks the potent subtext and overall greatness of 1985's ""Runaway Train,"" it makes up for it with its realistic and kinetic tone, not to mention the fact that it's based on a true incident.GRADE: B",Unstoppable
30,gradyharp,Well Done Action Movie,8,17 February 2011,"UNSTOPPABLE is a genre film - minimal story/lots of action - and as such it succeeds very well. Probably for audience breathing time the story line introduces some psychological exchanges between the two characters - in formation about their family lives that seem oddly out of place with all the terror on the screen - and that aspect of the film adds some human drama that makes the final product more credible: it is, actually based on a true story. The fact that veteran action flick creators - writer Mark Bombeck and director Tony Scott - are 'on board' this project assures the popularity quotient. Frank (Denzel Washington) is an aging soon to be retired train engineer and is joined by a young, emotionally distracted but well-trained new conductor Will (Chris Pine) who are out on what seems to be a routine run in Pennsylvania. They banter caustically until hearing that there is a full speed runaway train (engineer Dewey - Ethan Suplee - left his position in the train with the throttle on) that happens to be carrying toxic chemicals. Should the train proceed with its runaway course many lives could be endangered when the train reaches a critical curve in the tracts in Stanton , PA. Frank decides the only way to stop the train would be to go in reverse and lock onto the back of the train, putting on the brakes to slow the runaway train. Frank and Will decide to brave the elements and attempt this near impossible task, much against the advice of the chief Galvin (Kevin Dunn) but with the daring go ahead signal form the men's immediate boss Connie (Rosario Dawson). During this breakneck chase Will relates his fragile marriage to a wife (Jessy Schram) who refuses to return or accept his calls and Frank confides in Will that his wife died a few years ago form cancer, leaving his the sole parent for his two daughters (Elizabeth Mathis and Meagan Tandy): they both have family deadlines to meet that very day. How the two not only become friends but allies in heroic effort to stop the incipient tragedy makes of the ending of the film. Washington and Pine make fine acting partners and the off the tracks work by Dawson and Dunn and the other small parts are well executed. The special effects are excellent. The fact that seemingly far-fetched story is true adds to the appreciation of the film. This is a solid action flick with some standout performances. Grady Harp",Unstoppable
31,zetes,Pretty lousy,6,26 August 2012,"Tony Scott's final film, it turns out. I'm not the biggest fan, for sure, but he made a couple of films I really liked (most notably The Hunger, True Romance and Deja Vu), and I had heard this one was pretty good. It's okay. Certainly not his worst (which would probably be either Man on Fire or Domino, from what I've seen), but it still has that aggressive, camera-moving-everywhere-in-the-midst-of-hundreds-of-edits style he adopted in the latter half of his career. The story is fairly uninteresting, and I don't much care for either lead. Denzel Washington, well, you couldn't criticize him for his work before the past six or seven years, but he's grown increasingly lazy, and his laziness is always at his peak when working with Tony Scott (he gives the same performance in every one of his Scott-directed films). I hated Chris Pine in Star Trek. Thankfully, he's more forgettable than awful here. None of the rest of the cast shines, either, and I feel damn sorry for poor Ethan Suplee, who gets the completely insulting role of fat idiot who understands how his train works about as well as he understands how to make one of those Magic Eye posters work (we're helpfully told in the ending freeze-frames that he now works in fast food). Okay, so when there's a lot of running and jumping and explosions it's not too bad.",Unstoppable
32,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Unstoppable,10,4 November 2010,"In 1994 we have a pulsating chase movie set up with a speeding bus that cannot go below 50 miles per hour, hurtling through crowded streets and even performing a jump to cross a break in the roads, with plenty of cop cars in hot pursuit, and the good guys trying their mighty best to rescue all unwitting hostages and save the day. That was Jan de Bont's Speed, and until this day I haven't found an equal playing on that one same gimmick, until Tony Scott's Unstoppable.Granted this is no gimmick of course, as it's inspired by the real life incident in 2001 known as the ""Crazy Eights"" where a freight train, through the carelessness of man, gets to roll off along its tracks carrying too many cars and too much hazardous material, posing a danger to residents in towns that lie in its inevitable path, with the brakes off and the power on. For dramatic cinema this culminates to the train pulverizing everything thrown in its path in attempts to make it stop, even at the expense of a derailment plan costing millions of dollars in direct and indirect damages to people, property and the environment. We get plenty of screen time demonstrating just how mean this monstrosity of a train is, especially when it growls and rumbles loudly through the sense-surround audio in a decent cinema hall.The film wastes no time setting up the blame game on those responsible for the debacle, and Tony Scott does what Tony Scott does best, weaving the material in his usual break neck pace of quick edits and cuts in presenting a film that, like a train, is set on reaching its destination on time in unrelenting speed, which worked surprisingly well at keeping you at the edge of your seat as events unfold. It seems Tony hasn't had enough of playing with trains yet with his last film being a remake of The Taking of Pelham 123, and here he reunites with leading actor Denzel Washington (third feature in a row after Deja Vu and the aforementioned!) who decided that it's probably more fun at the helm of a locomotive engine as an engineer, than coordinating efforts from inside a control centre, a job that falls onto the lap of Rosario Dawson's Connie, who provides that tension filled perspective from within the confines of the control room being the liaison between her troops on the ground, and the board room bureaucracy.Lending additional eye candy is Chris Pine, who drops his Captain Kirk swagger to play a unionized train conductor, who provides some dramatic gravitas in being the new kid on the block with plenty of baggage, both emotionally through his battle against a restraining order from his wife and kid, and professionally deemed as some kind of a white horse riding on his last name, coming in to replace a bunch of experienced veterans at their game. The story by Mark Bomback had time to dwell fleetingly between workers protected by a union and those who aren't and standing to lose a bunch of benefits when they get the pink slip, and the fight between youthful energy and what practical, technical experience can bring to the table. The film celebrates the strengths different parties in an organization can offer, although reserving scathing comments through the characterization of those sitting in cushy offices during a crisis, making all the arrogantly wrong decisions because they can, and consciously making a choice not to listen to those they deem insignificant down the corporate ladder, preferring to resort to threats.Outside of those moments is where all the action is, albeit there would be some if watching in a hall not equipped with proper sound, may think there's nothing interesting in watching a bunch of guys chase a runaway train. Truth is you'd probably get a kick out of the authenticity of the film, especially with the utilization of industry lingo that raises that sense of reality up a notch, putting you in the thick of the action as it unfolds. With the narrative also getting peppered by television newsreel presentations, it provides the feeling that you're witnessing everything live. If you're looking for a film that grabs you by the collar and never lets up from the get go, despite its predictability at times and how invulnerable you know the leads are, then this is the film for you, and it's difficult not to root anyone on in this Tony Scott film since you know what's at stake, the death defying stunts and to desire a favourable outcome. What works is that it's never about emerging as heroes, but the ability to harness one's skills and coming from wanting to do the right thing, despite the odds.Highly recommended, and I'll include this into my shortlist for one of the best, and a definite high adrenaline pumper amongst my favourites of the year.

33,namashi_1,Entertainment...,7,11 February 2011,"Tony Scott's 2010 hit 'Unstoppable' is Ideal Pop-Corn Entertainment! The veteran filmmaker is back with a bang, as this thrilling journey hits the right points! 'Unstoppable' tells the story of a runaway freight train, and the two men who try their best to stop it.What works in here the most, is Scott's gripping & taut direction. if the writing material is of hold-your-attention types, the direction is of pure style in execution. Scott handles the film remarkably, and he has made a worthy film that offers loads and loads of thrilling moments! A Special Mention to Ben Seresin, who has photographed the film wonderfully.Acting Wise, Denzel Washington is quite natural. Chris Pine rules the show, with a superb performance. Rosario Dawson is good. Lew Temple is first-rate. Kevin Dunn is his usual self.On the whole, Grab your Popcorn, Sip your Cola and Enjoy This Roller-Coaster Ride! Thumbs Up!",Unstoppable
34,StevePulaski,Denzel doesn't want to be a man on fire again,8,10 September 2011,"Tony Scott clings to Denzel Washington like Dennis Dugan clings to Adam Sandler. For years, Washington has been in many movies directed by Tony Scott, but I don't think any have surpassed this one in quality. This is a step up for both men as they work together to create a suspense-filled action film about a runaway train roaring on the tracks over seventy miles an hour destroying anything in its path.The train becomes unmanned and labeled a ""runaway"" after Dewey (Suplee) fails to set the brakes fully by using the switch. The switch then falls to ""full throttle"" resulting in the train speeding increasingly faster on the main track. Veteran Frank (Washington) and rookie Will (Pine) attempt to stop it by using a number of plans instructed by a secretary who does everything but paint her nails (Dawson).Unstoppable is a big-budget popcorn flick, and that's one of the many things I like about it. It gives backstory, but it never asks for sympathy of any of the main characters. After all, the action films easily overshadow the storyline. This almost reminds me of an underrated eighties film called Maximum Overdrive. In that film, machines themselves come alive and start attacking the people around them. Both films are good for some mindless, enjoyable, and all out entertainment.Besides providing some fun, Unstoppable seems to get carried away in parts and becomes silly rather than realistic. The more I thought about it, the more I thought it's rather inevitable that a disaster film gets out of control. But if you compare Unstoppable with a poorly made action film that relies on clichés, lackluster escapes at the last second, and pitifully shameful acting like 2012, I suppose you could pat this one on the back for not taking that route.Unstoppable sports its ""Inspired By True Events"" text because it's based on the CSX 8888 incident that took place in 2001. In Walbridge, Ohio, a train carrying thousands of gallons of a harmful liquid was speeding on the track at over fifty miles an hour before finally being stopped by a man in Kenton, Ohio. The events in the film, while dramatized for entertainment purposes, seem to lift directly from the true event making this worthy of the statement at the beginning of the film and on the poster.This is an engaging action film, inspired not by stupidity, but an honest accident. There's rarely any humor which is nice, and every actor gives a believable and memorable performance. Unstoppable isn't a perfect film, but it will win the hearts of train enthusiasts and action seekers. Which is perfectly acceptable to me.Starring: Denzel Washington, Chris Pine, Rosario Dawson, Kevin Dunn, and Ethan Suplee. Directed by: Tony Scott.",Unstoppable
35,lasttimeisaw,Unstoppable: 7/10,7,30 November 2010,"Watched this film in the cinema, it is neat and clean action film, no impertinent branches, when the train eventually was stopped, in five minutes the film ended timely. And amazingly it was a true adrenaline rush which can keep audience stuck in their seats and thoroughly enjoy these 96 minutes.Denzel Washington and Tony Scott have been worked together for five films (DEJA VU 2006, MAN ON FIRE 2004, CRIMSON TIDE 1995), last year a remake of THE TAKING OF PELHAM 123 underperformed at the box office and received many negative reviews as well, luckily this time, UNSTOPPABLE has successfully rescued their bankable credits. If one doesn't expect too much (for example, an outstanding performance from the two- times Oscar winner), there is great fun to watch this film, I admit that the cheesy plot is predictable, but Tony Scott has done a wonderful job to make it durable under a perfectly conciliated pace, let me completely forget the disastrous DOMINO (2005) (the editing and photography is my incubus). Chris Pine is on his rise to become a bigger name after STAR TREK (2009), of course UNSTOPPABLE is not a blemish on his CV, an American heroic image could propel him further down the isle of the next big thing. Unexpectedly Rosario Dawson gives an intense and solid performance to magnify her charisma in her staple role, she deserves some much better script other than the ridiculous PERCY JACKSON film I watched not long ago. Finally one thing to complain, Washington is not aging very well, when will he get another Oscar-baiting role anyway? As in the past years he has earned enough banknotes for his family through Hollywood mainstream box office blusters (such as THE BOOK OF ELI 2010), I think now it is the right time to collect his third naked golden statue.",Unstoppable

37,KineticSeoul,Almost dull and generic as the trailer,6,26 January 2011,"When I first saw the trailer to this film, I really wasn't hyped at all for it. It just seemed really generic and seemed like it was going in one of those cheesy 90's movie style and nothing about the trailer stood out at all. But got around to seeing it anyways, and it wasn't as terrible as the trailer made it seem but it wasn't that good either. In fact so much of it was generic from the dialogue the character development to the action I quickly got bored of it. Even all the disaster after disaster that happens in this movie seemed way too forced cause just about everything that can go wrong, goes wrong. Denzel Washington and Chris Pine put on a pretty good performance and worked well with each other and the character development is believable for the most part. But besides that nothing about this movie stood out and can easily be forgotten. Tony Scott's trademark shaky and choppy camera work got more annoying than effective.6.2/10",Unstoppable
38,sddavis63,It's All About The Action,8,2 January 2011,"If you're into slow and deliberate buildups and strong character development, my advice would be to look elsewhere. Such things are most definitely lacking in ""Unstoppable."" This is a high octane, adrenaline pumping action movie set on the train tracks of Pennsylvania, as two railroad employees - veteran engineer Frank (Denzel Washington) and rookie Will (Chris Pine) - set themselves to the task of using their locomotive to chase down and stop a runaway train with no one at the controls that's carrying dangerously flammable cargo through heavily populated parts of the state. Washington and Pine were both very good in their respective roles, and director Tony Scott keeps the tension at a high pitch from early on. The train originally gets away when its conductor jumps out to throw a switch to change tracks, believing that he had put the brakes on. From there on the train gradually picks up speed, smashes through a number of crossings and doing in a number of vehicles (with no one getting hurt as far as I could see) as it approaches a massive curve near the town of Stanton, which it can't possibly survive at the speed it's travelling.It gets your heart pumping. There's no doubt about that. It's a pretty simple movie that jumps right into things and never bores you for even a second. It's even apparently a fair representation of the real events that inspired it, the main difference being that the real runaway train was in Ohio in May of 2001. The movie naturally takes some dramatic license to ramp up the excitement. In particular, apparently although the real train was out of control and unmanned, it never did reach the speeds spoken of in the movie, and the manner in which the rookie engineer managed to get aboard to stop the train was somewhat less dramatic than the portrayal in the movie. But - with dramatic licence accounted for and apparently within acceptable limits - this is the story. And it's a good one!",Unstoppable
39,Hellmant,Unstoppable indeed!,8,12 November 2010,"'UNSTOPPABLE': Four Stars (Out of Five) Denzel Washington teams with director Tony Scott for the fifth time (after 'CRIMSON TIDE', 'MAN ON FIRE', 'DEJA VU' and 'THE TAKING OF PELHAM 123). The only film of Tony's to not feature Denzel since 'MAN ON FIRE', in 2004, is 'DOMINO', which starred Keira Knightley and Mickey Rourke. Almost every director has there 'go to actor' (for Scorsese it was Deniro and now DiCaprio, Kevin Smith had Ben Affleck, Judd Apatow has Seth Rogen, Robert Rodriguez has Antonio Banderas and Danny Trejo, James Cameron had Arnold Schwarzenegger, Steven Soderbergh has George Clooney and the list goes on and on), for Scott it's Denzel and they make a good team. Chris Pine (the new James T. Kirk of STAR TREK' fame) co-stars and Mark Bomback wrote the script (he also wrote 'LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD'). The film is just a fun crowd pleasing action film but it's extremely entertaining and I can't see it disappointing anyone really. It is what it is and it's the type of film that almost everyone will enjoy.The film is loosely based on the true events of an unmanned train in northwest Ohio in 2001 that sped around at up to 47 miles per hour for 66 miles until it was stopped by a second train coupling with it and applying it's brakes. That train had tank cars containing molten phenol, a harmful toxic ingredient of paint. The film tells the story of a freight train a half a mile long which carries toxic chemicals that if derailed and spilled could wipe out a town. Washington stars as Frank, a veteran engineer being forced into early retirement, and Pine plays a rookie conductor named Will who's wife has filed a restraining order against him and won't let him see his kid (due to aggressive actions he took over text message jealousy). Frank has issues of his own with his two daughters, who work at Hooters. These two down on their luck losers decide to play hero and chase the train down in a separate locomotive attempting to hook up with it and slow it down before it derails on a curve and wipes out the city of Stanton. Of course they bond in the process.The story doesn't seem like there's much to it but it's extremely fast paced and action packed. Several movies lately have proved the ability to take a simple brief concept and expand it into an involving suspenseful story (Like 'FROZEN' and 'BURIED'). In my opinion that's what great movie making is all about. The movie is both thrilling and surprisingly emotional and character driven. It's of course not Oscar material and Scott's directing is very stylistic and flashy (much in the same way that Michael Bay's is) but it's a lot of fun and a heck of a good time at the movies. There's no real violence and yet it's still a roller coaster ride, suitable for almost all ages really. In a lot of ways it's similar to the same feel of a movie like 'SPEED', except not as over the top and more reality driven. It's perfect popcorn entertainment.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4rYA-j3f3c",Unstoppable
40,thesar-2,Speed 3: Train Wreck,3,21 December 2010,"Where Airplane! shot through 100's of jokes and had the highest joke per frame than any other movie, Unstoppable succeeded in the same ratios. Unfortunately, their version of jokes is also known as Disaster Movie Clichés.Seriously. The movie's only 98 minutes long and they have twice that many predictable, overused and pathetically ""heart-wrenching"" scenes to last six Lifetime movies.That all said, if you have never, ever, EVER seen a Disaster Flick with the feel-good, underdogs will overthrow the big-bad-bosses, you might actually enjoy this flick. Heck, I even felt a bit of some tension, despite the overblown finale.Here we have two completely wasted roles in Washington and Pine in the leads. Wasted as Washington is generally very good and Pine definitively has potential, yet they could've shaved some of the budget by casting unknowns. Oh, wait, they needed them to sell the movie.OK, this ""inspired by a true story"" isn't anything new, nor close to the truth. (SEE: the true story for yourself. 70mph runaway train, my ass.) Yet, if you leave your brain at the door, by all means, step in and enjoy mindless entertainment.On par with World Trade Center, we have ""Hero"" Frank (Washington) and up'n'coming Smartass Will (Pine), each with their ""Oh, we care about their background family issues"" stories on a training (ha, get it, training. Sorry, I have to find amusement somewhere) when ALL OF A SUDDEN the idiot from TV's My Name is Earl (Suplee, also playing, surprisingly, an idiot here) lets loose an unmanned train at 70mph that mightverywellDESTROY AN ENTIRE TOWN! Naturally, we have to give it to the big wigs to screw up with uneducated answers that might VERY WELL COST LIVES! If only they sped the train up to 88mph and while back in time the inevitable toxicants on the train wouldn't harm anyone in 1885 Pennsylvania.So, anywaysthey don't play heroes, but must become heroes to stop/slow down a train that, beyond little odds, should destroy a small town. And outside of the obvious conclusion, you know it's based on a true story so.guess who wins in the Man Vs. Machine climax?Get past the VERY typical (Director) Tony Scott music video (also overused) cinematography – man, I'm getting sick of that – or step-by-step/A-B-C Disaster Movie plot, it was the media in the film that p@ssed me off the most. If Seinfeld's finale taught us anything, put down the damn camera and either step out of the way or help in some way. I'd give up ""knowing"" what was happening to our brave heroes or their techniques, without their constant and horrid narration.Whewrant's over. I don't give this the lowest rating because it's harmless and at under an hour and a half, you could do worse (like watching a Syfy Saturday Night Disaster Movie Marathon) but honestly, not much better.",Unstoppable
41,Lejink,"Freight train, freight train, going so fast...",6,23 January 2011,"A one-trick pony of a film - namely, better stop the train! That's the plot folks and though both leads Denzel Washington and Chris Pine get a little back-story each, these are of little interest to the viewer and if anything hold up the story.In reality of course everyone would be shouting out ""This is just like that Hollywood film, Speed"", and we'd all have been in on the joke, but instead director Tony Scott takes it all a little too seriously and tries to convince us that it's a true story, happening in real -time, magically caught on CNN and thus beamed live into the television news as a breaking story.Anyway, initial uneasy bedfellows, workmates Washington and Pine set aside their petty differences to combine heroically to save the day, as if you didn't know. Washington is solid as the patriarchal older man, Pine fine as the woman-troubled new kid. In truth the film gets better acting than it perhaps deserves. I had some problem with the editing, with Scott's penchant for multi - camera, multi - perspective multi- cutaway camera-work, which far from adding to the desired realism only heightened the artificiality, not to say ludicrousness of the plot.In the end though this was an exciting, involving piece, particularly as the train hurtled to that deadman's curve. Unpretentious fare, don't look for it at any awards ceremony, but it should fly off the DVD rental shelf",Unstoppable
42,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,Scott and Washington collaborate and deliver another success of it's sort,9,22 June 2011,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Older, experienced Frank (Denzel Washington), who has secretly just received his marching orders, is assigned to take new boy Will (Chris Pine) under his wing, driving the freight trains across Pennsylvania. The relationship is frosty to begin with, as the dynamic between them is tested, but when news comes in of a freight train with dangerous, highly flammable liquids that has gone out of control careering around the state, the two men are locked in a race against time to get it under control before a catastrophe occurs.Blockbuster stelwart Tony Scott and acting maestro Denzel Washington tend to collaborate and deliver the more mature 'event' picture, free from the overblown corniness that either of them might succumb to if they worked with anyone else, as films like Crimson Tide have shown in the past. Unstoppable, unbelievably a true story, is a smaller scale effort but is another example of this approach, played out in more of a Crimewatch reconstruction style manner than a typical Hollywood flick churned out the cookie cutter, with the colour and sound impressively drained out to give it that extra feel of authenticity. Scott employs a more restrained style, and keeps it a while before the big explosions/effects kick in, concentrating more on building up a sense of tension and drama. I think the intention here is a 'real time' thriller, played out as if events are happening right in front of you. Cast wise, Denzel is as dynamic as ever in the lead, though with more sparing screen time than he's probably used to, so even if the rest of the cast don't make much of an impression, they've got the best to steer the train, in a metaphorical sense. ****",Unstoppable
43,bowmanblue,Simplistic fun,7,24 January 2015,"It's a rare 'action' film which doesn't really bother with some sort of 'evil' antagonist. Many people have likened 'Unstoppable' to the classic nineties epic, 'Speed.' However, the only reason Keanu Reeves had to stop a speeding bus was because Dennis Hopper had put a bomb on it, hence the threat. In 'Unstoppable' we literally don't have a sentient enemy for our heroes (Denzil Washington and Chris Pine) to do battle with. Instead, we simply have a train.Due to a mix-up on the platform, a giant freight train (naturally carrying some pretty explosive cargo) runs amok without a driver at the helm. And our railway workers, Washington and Pine, are the only pair in the right place at the right time to stop it. That's about it. I have to say that when I read the synopsis, I wasn't that impressed. It sounded a little dull. I thought any 'action' film worthy of the genre should at least have a couple of mad bombers threatening humanity. As it happened, I was wrong.Unstoppable is actually really good fun. It's not a long film (only slightly over the hour and a half mark) and it rattles by like the train everyone's trying to catch. It's so simply there really isn't much you can say about it. One train. Two men. No brakes. That's about it.Granted there are a few attempts at sub-plots surrounding Washington and Pine's families, but the film doesn't focus on that aspect too much. It sticks to what it does best – the train and everyone's attempts to stop it.I suppose there was always the chance that a simple story like this would end up dull. And it's probably worth crediting the stars and the director for bringing what could have probably been a turkey to life. Tony Scott shines at the helm and it's a pity that this was his last film due to his tragic death. It's clear he was a most talented director and will be sorely missed.If you're just a fan of either of the two leads then you'll like this, or if you just like action films in general. It definitely doesn't need a human antagonist to add any extra tension to the mix. Don't judge. Give it a try.",Unstoppable

This is about how a veteran and a rookie in the railroad business work together to stop a train full of toxic chemicals before it crashes into a town.The acting is very good.

49,The-Sarkologist,A rather straightforward movie about a run-away train,6,27 December 2013,"This was an okay movie, but I went and saw it because my brother loves movies about trains, especially runaway trains, and so this movie was right down his ally. I must say that he did enjoy it, so that is all that counts.Anyway, an idiot train driver decided to get out of the engine of the train to turn a switch, tripped over, and the train got away from him and started speeding down the line leading to a number of emergencies that needed to be dealt with. This first was a train full of school children, and the second a bend in the rail that ran past a number of tanks full of toxic chemicals. If the train hit the bend too fast then it would derail causing a catastrophe.The movie itself dealt with the thrill of two heroes trying to stop the train while fighting with the executives that thought they had the solutions, while sitting in their office not knowing what was really going on the ground using theories that the engineers knew wouldn't work.Working for a multinational myself I know the frustrations that occur when head office makes a decision that we must follow, even though we, on the ground, must put it into action while being frustrated at the lack of hearing above. I guess what this movie does say is that what seems to be impossible is not always impossible, and that to do the impossible what we need to do is to go out an do it.While this movie is based upon a true story, we must remember that when Hollywood does get its hands on a true story they tend to exaggerate it, a lot. In real life the train was travelling at 47 miles an our, in the movie it was 70. The number of toxic tanks on the real train was 2, in the movie, it was 6. Still, what seems to be bad in real life, when put onto the big screen, the director nevertheless makes it so much worse. I guess that is what makes a good movie.",Unstoppable

It's like 'Speed' on a train. I enjoyed the character and location set-up. Based on fact, this was even more thrilling. Off course, the film is more sensational than fact, but I'll disregard that for the sake of an entertaining film.Tony Scott wanted to do everything as practical as possible, and on location instead of a studio. The result is a film that looks incredibly realistic, and the action and danger is real. 'Unstoppable' is an incredible production, and exciting from the get go!

52,filipemanuelneto,"A competent, engaging and well-built action movie.",8,2 November 2019,"This film, based very lightly on an incident that actually happened, chronicles how a large freight train rode uncontrollably at breakneck speed for tens of kilometers without a driver, and attempts to stop it before it derailed and caused casualties or damage. incalculable.Directed by Tony Scott (who seems to have a crush on trains, this being his second movie involving one, a year after he directed and released ""Taking of Pelham 123"") is a very competent action movie, which pleased me and arrested until the end. It's a well-built movie, with strong assumptions and a positive development, where all the tension is slowly built and increasing as attempts to stop the train fail one after the other. The film is good at its efforts to convince us of the danger that that runaway train poses, especially to innocent people who live or are in the immediate vicinity of the railway line. We really cheer for them, and for the brave railmen who, on the ground, try to put a stop to that train.Denzel Washington is, as usual, a good protagonist, even though he has to share the spotlight with Chris Pine, who is also a capable actor with camera presence. Both are very good when they play together, and the dialogues between them are some of the deepest and most reflective moments in the movie. If one embodies the action scenes, the other is the ""wise old man"" in the movie. Rosario Dawson is a good addition to the cast, with a good job and a nice presence. The rest of the cast, however, does not stand out or merit note. They do what they should do without standing out.Technically, the film bets heavily on photography and a mode of filming that accentuates the speed of what is being filmed. So the train always seems much faster than it probably will. There is little footage with the still camera, which was a conscious, smart bet from Scott. Sound effects help a lot, and were used competently.In short, this is a competent action movie that can arrest us from the start. It's not brilliant, but it does engage the audience and give them two hours of quality entertainment. It promises no more than that, and that is what it gives us.",Unstoppable
53,TheMovieDiorama,"Unstoppable might not be adrenaline fuelled, but it is an extremely watchable flick.",7,26 February 2018,"The collaborations between the late Tony Scott and Denzel Washington were not going to set the world on fire. Yet I keep getting drawn back to them. The competence both behind the camera and on screen makes for thrilling films, and Unstoppable is no different. A train is left stupidly on full throttle and is unmanned. Carrying hazardous cargo, two train drivers take it upon themselves to stop this train from potentially killing thousands. It does sound ridiculous, right? You would be correct. Now I'm no train expert but you would think you could remotely stop a train these days? Regardless, I find this to be fun. I can always watch this and not become bored. It's not everyday someone compares a train to a missile, just that alone puts a smile on my face (evidently I'm sadistic). What prevents this from being a mind numbingly boring action flick is the focus on troubled personal lives. Washington and Pine's characters both have difficult times away from work, and its through them discussing this that they actually bond closer. The impending doom as Dawson's sassy yet professional character consistently exclaims ""6 minutes!"" or ""it's just passed milestone 46, you gotta hurry up!"" in order to create thrills. Slightly uninspired but it does the trick. All the performances were competent, nothing outstanding but it gets the job done. The different techniques in order to try and halt this train were interesting to say the least. Derailing it, forcing a train ahead of it to try and slow it down, shooting at a tiny switch...some real genius work there...! Scott's direction was fast and frantic which assisted in maintaining the adrenaline, safe to say he did have a unique style which I fully appreciated. Look, you'll either watch Unstoppable thinking ""I say, this is absolute tosh!"" or you could sit back, relax and just enjoy what's on screen. Please be the latter, because this is a good time and y'know...not every film needs to be extraordinary.",Unstoppable

Instead of a hostage situation, however, ""Unstoppable"" is much simpler: what if a freight train went unmanned at speeds up to 70-plus miles per hour carrying highly explosive materials as part of its mile-long cargo? Minus a personified antagonist in the form a a wack-job (RIP Dennis Hopper), this is ""Speed"" the train edition.The plot, which was inspired but not based on a true story, barrels along exactly like Train No. 777. But Mark Bomback (""Live Free or Die Hard"") doesn't cut the humanity out of the story. Although not entirely without awkward friction, he slides in the character development and the human angle to keep the story real. Washington's Frank and Chris Pine's (""Star Trek"") Will have just enough backstory and believability to up the stakes and provide the motivation necessary for two railroad workers to put it all on the line and go after this train in attempt to slow it down. Sure, it's a bit weird that Frank would ask Will about the situation with his wife while the two are going backwards on a train at 80-90 mph, but it's earnest.In spite of the simplicity of the concept, Scott keeps things intense without overdoing it. The thriller veteran employs a great deal of tactics to increase the apparent magnitude of the situation. The only annoying one (and this is partly on the script) is the overblown live coverage of the event on the news (not to mention unrealistic). The audience knows everything going on; we generally don't need a newscaster to re-narrate it for us (""it appears he is trying to manually brake the train!""). It gets a little agitating, but the action has your attention in a vice, so it doesn't matter.Since ""Unstoppable"" is sort of a disaster film, Bomback finds ways of making ""the man"" the antagonist. Initially, it appears as if the railroad company wants to attempt to preserve the train with costs as the primary interest and not derail it and lessen the chance for civilian casualties should the train reach more populated areas. It's a small peek into how major companies handle PR nightmares such as these. One of the film's better scenes is when Frank and Will commit to disobeying the orders of the authoritative character, Galvin (Kevin Dunn of ""Transformers"") and verbally give him the middle finger.In essence, ""Unstoppable"" confines the reach of the film and infuses the core elements with enough guts to make the film entertaining and intriguing despite the sheer simplicity of concept. You wouldn't expect a film about freight trains to excite anyone except model train collectors, but there's no lack of intensity. The story certainly fits Scott's filmmaking style and Washington (as always) and Pine hold up the human aspect.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com",Unstoppable
56,jzappa,"Lots of Sound, Flash, Momentum and Manipulation, Only a Rudimentary Level of Thrill",6,17 November 2010,"Opening with the card ""inspired by true events,"" this fast, loud and flashy popcorn picture inevitably gives itself a bigger train, more perilous chemicals, another train, full of schoolchildren, located along the route, and a story-bound mortal struggle along the way. There's even a car that does an unwarranted somersault as Scott shamelessly employed to excess in his previous train film, the star-filled remake of The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3. The opposite of that film occurs here: It's the human aspect of Unstoppable that stammers, with scarcely serviceable back-stories and muscle-flexing dialogue that stick a tranlucent glaze of human drama to all the sound, metal and fury.Only since Domino, Scott's puerile histrionics have become more hackneyed and banal than programmed railway stopovers. Just as Denzel's character cites that his daughters work at Hooters, we know where the formal disaster watch party will be. Just as the train first starts moving, you know there'll be numerous opportunely located fuel containers next to the very curve where it's expected to derail, entirely because the prospective catastrophe has to be more conveniently cataclysmic than realism tends to sanction.Unlike his older brother who's made an effort to explore assorted genres throughout his career, Tony's blissfully chosen to concentrate on making one brand of film: superficial, aggressive, male-dominated action movies. That style has gratified him commercially and, periodically, creatively also. It's no happenstance that Domino, his most ambitious endeavor to drastically spice up his time-tested blueprint, was also his largest commercial failure.Pine and Washington don't essentially have to consume the whole film at one another's throats, however their personal drama should augment the action. Exclusive of that enhancement, this never gives a thematic anchor to its unrelentingly fast succession of images, yielding lots of sound, momentum and rage but just a moderate level of thrill.Maybe the meaningless cunning that went into the script is well exemplified by the especially transparent aforementioned scene where Denzel explicates that his daughters, 18 and 19, are waitressing to pay for college. ""Where?"" Pine asks. In actuality, Pine's question would be taken to mean, ""Where are they going to college?"" since who cares where they're waitressing? Nevertheless here, the crucial question of where they're waitressing must be answered, because it's at a Hooters, a shameless way for the movie to get some fleeting eye candy into its macho world of heroically defiant working men: the girls just so happen to be at work in their tight tank tops and hotpants when Daddy appears on Fox News. Rosario Dawson, as the yardmaster, doesn't come to work scantily clad, but one of the guys who set the train off at large gets to call her a ""ball-buster"" for doing her job.Screenwriter Mark Bomback echoes some of the most irritating issues of his script for Live Free or Die Hard, sketching female characters as sporadic stock sounding boards mistakenly upset with the male heroes until a life-and-death situation comes along and all they're doing is watching and gasping in worry for them. And somehow the mere fact that they're female is supposed to automatically make us like and care about the males more.Indeed, the entire climax is being broadcast to barely developed peripheral characters not just at Hooters but in various locations via Fox News, with everyone cheering and gasping at the coverage. I find it no coincidence that the studio producing Unstoppable is no other than 20th Century Fox, plugging their sensationalistic political advocacy network and making it look as if a whole slew of people can rely on it for consistent news casting. Everyone who sees this movie is faced not only with a climax annotated with the canned laughter equivalent to suspense---the pep rally-like audience of spectators watching the heroes to inform our spectator reactions---but the audiovisual consumption of scores of people looking to the most corrupt media source there is as a beacon of encouragement and showcase of heroism.Sure, the movie contrives baddies out of corporate weasels who value profit over people, but all we really get is a CEO briefly glimpsed on a golf course, muttering into a cell phone about a potential $100 million loss and reduced share prices, but he's never seen again, never held responsible. Just the way Fox wants it.The audience laughs at the addendum telling that Ethan Suplee's ignorant culprit was fired and now works in fast food. We're not supposed to think about how that's the sole option other than a blue-collar job in many parts of the country. Or how a cultivation of cost-cutting has played the largest role in numerous rail-freight mishaps in the last 20 years, including the one that inspired this movie!!! I just read that a Pennsylvania pollution derailment happened half a year before that incident, then again another six months later in New York, during which time the company allotted best-ever income and its CEO went to work in the regulation-disinclined Bush administration. But that's not the movie Rupert Murdoch wants you to see, and it's certainly not the proceedings being watched by all the characters gripped by his channel's coverage of the heroic spectacle.But let me quickly work in what I liked about the movie. The audiovisual scheme here are exceptionally effectual in illustrating that a train is a massively heavy machine, and once moving wants to persist. Naturally, but Scott virtually squashes us with the mass of the admirably anti-CGI colossus. There is indeed a serviceable purpose to Scott's soaring, swooshing, thrashing camera here other than simple hyperbolic over-kinesis: Even off the train, we're constantly seeing things through the simulated feel of a moving train.",Unstoppable
57,Turfseer,More thrills in 2012's end of the world concept than Unstoppable's runaway train,4,17 November 2010,"I'm not a great fan of disaster films in general but I'm willing to judge each one on its own merits. Somehow the concept of ""Unstoppable"", a rather perfunctory tale of your basic runaway train did not sound as exciting as last year's ""2012"" which involved the end of the world due a shift in the earth's core.For the most part, both Unstoppable and 2012 had protagonists marked by a turbulent domestic situation. The protagonist in 2012 is John Cusack's Jackson Curtis who loves his kids but must deal with the painful separation from his ex-wife who has now shacked up with a new boyfriend. Unstoppable's Will (Chris Pine) is in even more turmoil: his wife has just taken a restraining order against him after he mistakenly confronts a friend of hers, a state trooper who he erroneously believes has been having an affair with her.Also part of the formula is having a set of black characters, allies to the protagonist, who can do no wrong. 2012's President Thomas Wilson (played by Danny Glover) is a fountain of wisdom who ultimately sacrifices his life as he chooses to 'go down with the ship' with his constituents as Washington, DC is submerged by a tsunami. And of course Denzel Washington's Frank Barnes is a engineer with almost 30 years of experience who makes sure that the untutored and immature Will makes all the right moves, ultimately guiding him on how to stop the unstoppable train.The heroes also must have a technological adviser that will play a key role in solving the dilemma of the disaster. Dr. Adrian Helmsely, the American geologist, is instrumental in aiding Curtis in his quest for survival. Similarly, in Unstoppable, Federal Inspector Werner (Kevin Corrigan) advises Barnes how to control the train's throttles so that he can slow the train down at a critical juncture.Disaster films also must have their share of unsavory types that place obstacles in the way of the protagonist. 2012's Chief of Staff, Carl Annheuser (Oliver Platt), does not want to allow additional survivors on to the Ark and Galvin, the corporate railway chief, orders Connie not to derail the train in an unpopulated area, as it will lead to unacceptable financial losses.Finally, what would the disaster film be without that one wacky character who was right all along or ultimately saves the day? In 2012, it's Woody Harrelson's crazy Charley Frost who warns Cusack (Curtis) about the end of the world. In Unstoppable, it's crazy Ned the Welder, who drives a mean pickup truck and is mainly responsible for stopping the runaway train by allowing Will to jump from his truck on to the out of control train.Ultimately, it's the main concept that will make or break your disaster film. For me, 2012 was far more gripping as the concept of the end of the world due to a realignment in the earth's core seems a hell of a lot more plausible than the one in a million concept of the runaway train. Yes I know the runaway train is based on an actual event that occurred in 2001 but there was something about how the entire event is depicted that I didn't find very thrilling.In 2012, the protagonist and his allies' survival is threatened at every turn—they are literally one inch from death just about every minute in the film once the event of the disaster begins. In Unstoppable, the thrills come at you at a glacial pace. The efforts to stop the train often don't feel very believable. Instead of dropping someone from a helicopter, couldn't someone have simply jumped from the lead locomotive as the engineer attempted to slow the train down from the front?Worse still is Barnes and Will's machinations in trying to get the train to stop. There are only a few mild thrills when Barnes pulls the throttle following Werner's advice, or when Will tries to couple the trains together and injures his foot; or Barnes running from car to car and finally Will jumping from the pickup truck onto the main locomotive and stopping the train. Despite the predictable characters, director Tony Scott manages to create the illusion of a fast moving train through clever editing and an effective soundtrack. I wouldn't be surprised if you told me that the train was shot going only 10-15 miles per hour during the filming of each train sequence.In the end, the stakes aren't high enough for us to get very involved in Barnes and Will's struggle. There are few thrills here precisely because both of them are never placed in much jeopardy. When the train actually comes to a stop, my reaction was, ""is that it?"" Somehow, the stopping of a runaway train simply cannot compare to the State of California falling into the Pacific Ocean.",Unstoppable
58,elshikh4,TonyScott@annoying.com !,6,21 November 2011,"The accident is totally cinematic. It makes a unique disaster / action movie. We have 2 stars. Denzel is our guaranteed man's man, with his trademark million dollar smile. Chris Pine is establishing himself in a progressing way as a talented charismatic star. I hope him the years Denzel managed to still a star in.The drama of the train is the drama, so the drama of, and between, the main 2 characters is trivial; the sound effects were more taken care of. However, it did the necessary on scale of ""filling the scenes inside the train with anything else the train"", not to mention the happy, tearful, end scenes. On the other hand, the train drama suffered from absolutely FOOL antagonist. I couldn't believe the way that company's manager, played by Kevin Dunn, was written; so it's easy to know the fool I was referring to. However, the one who bugged, annoyed, and bothered me was the honorable Tony Scott!Dear Tony, don't think yourself God's gift for accelerating the pace in action movies. What you do is considered by any sane human a disturbing to peace more than accelerating a pace! Why oh why rotating the camera, as if a hysterical paroxysm attacking a rotating-maniac?? It's used and overused not many times, but FOR ALL THE TIME! Inside the lead's train, the headquarters, the manager's office, around the runaway train (by helicopters!), and around the press conference at the end.. Mr. Tony, what could mean enough for you? The answer: completely nothing!Scott was originally a music videos director who went to cinema with a music videos effect. That effect's positive points differ from movie to another. Sometimes it's good (Beverly Hills Cop II - 1987), very good (Crimson Tide - 1995), even excellent (Spy Game - 2001), or ominous (Domino - 2005)!! I think the matter alternates according to the way Scott sees the drama. Whenever the drama is powerful, the camera's tricks lessen, and whenever the drama is weak, then let's bomb these viewers to blindness and neurasthenia!In his previous movie, with Denzel, about another train, (The Taking of Pelham 123 - 2009), Scott overused the camera's circular moving for no reason but the excitement. Now, he does the same, but in hopelessly increasing manner, with almost every single shot. Then, along with very swift editing, he overused a *sudden* zoom-in that goes vexing after the first 20 times! I know that he wants to beat the somehow stiff 2 main locations, and the talkative scenes, but not by making the whole movie into just endless camera rotating, and sudden zoom-ins, running consecutively and madly. It's too much, dull, and dizzy, so beside blindness and neurasthenia, you can add seasickness as well! I hated how the image, with wildly fast cutting, loses its harmony in many places; review the opening credits sequence as a short example; it's frankly detrimental!Unstoppable is euphoric movie, with overdose of euphoria I guess. Well, fear brings the worst. And here it forced a fine director to exaggerate, so he wouldn't be called a master in action and an inept in talking scenes. Though, nothing is more inept, and adolescent, than his talking scenes in this movie. It pushes me, obnoxiously, to imagine that even his good action sequences are a product of as haphazard work!P.S: I loved the ironic moment at the end; when Ned, a marginal character who played a minor role in solving the crises, stands in full suit, having all the media interest, while the true heroes are in the back under the shadows.",Unstoppable

60,freemantle_uk,Exciting action film,7,9 November 2010,"When I first saw the trailer for Unstoppable I thought that it just looked like Thomas the Tank Engine on steroid, particularly an episode where Edward the old engine had to save the cocky younger train James who had become a runaway engine. Whilst Unstoppable is a festival of action clichés, it is not a Thomas the Tank Engine (which I loved as a child) and it a surprisingly exciting film.Loosely based a true story of a runaway train in Ohio. Denzel Washington plays Frank Barnes a veteran train engineer of 28-year-olds and Will Colston (Chris Pine), a young conductor who are forced to work together despite a generational rift. At the same time an idiot engineer Dewey (Ethan Suplee) lets a freight train with hazardous material runaway at 70 miles an hour. With Connie Hooper (Rosario Dawson) wanting to manage the disaster, her corporate boss Galvin (Kevin Dunn) takes control and every effort he does goes wrong. The only people who may be able to avoid a catastrophe are the two train drivers, with the hope to catch the train.Tony Scott is a master at delivering an action film and he is the Tom Clancy of directors (I mean that as a compliment). He has a able to mix action, real life and the media reaction to the event. Scott has a very kinetic style of direction, he shoot every scene like it was an action scene. The camera never stays still and he shoots in that grey, grainy style he likes so much. He is a traditionalist, he takes and makes the action sequences as real as possible. He uses stunts and old-school techniques to give Unstoppable a realistic feel and only uses CGI if there was no other option. But there is only so many times he can show aerial shots of trains speeding in the countryside before it gets boring. There is also a ridiculous scene where the police try and shoot at a train to hit the emergency brake which was next to the fuel tank; but only the Americans think that shooting at something solves a problem. Scott does deliver excitement with the action.The script is clichéd filled, there is the old and young man combo who have a dislike for every other, with the old man being a hard-ass and wise, not having to following the rules, whilst the young girl is cocky, both guys having troubled relationships at home and having to prove themselves as heroes for the friends, that business men at a major company think more about money then the human live and ignore the advice of the people on the ground, true working class people and that everything that can go wrong will go wrong. The scenes in the control room felt like that it was from 24 and there is a similar tone to Armageddon, but this film is better then that. Scott was pretty much given a 1970s/80s style disaster movie and he set out to bring in modern directional techniques and sequences in this fast paced package.But despite the clichés the actors have such authority that they do give their roles some quality. Washington is an excellent actor and this film is Chris Pine's big follow-up after Star Trek: both actors have strong chemistry together. Dawson is a glamorous woman in really life and I feared she was miss casted, but she was more grounded both in looks and performance and was injecting a Michelle Dresser character in the role; but I feel that her character was added because the film makers wanted a prominent female character and there is a lack of depth in her despite the rivalry with her boss. Also whilst Dunn did do his best and was good in film, it seemed that he casted because James Gandolfini was unavailable. Washington and Dawson also offered moments of deadpan comedy and Suplee is a natural comic talent. The film is serious in it's action and story but Scott did want inject some comedy.Overall, if you enjoy trains and railways you will like it and there are plenty of action scenes for fans. The story is standard but it is done well.",Unstoppable
61,PWNYCNY,Nonstop excitement. Clear the tracks!,10,20 November 2010,"From start to finish, this is one exciting movie. Nonstop action, tension, conflict and a plausible story combine to produce an excellent movie. And that this movie came out of Hollywood makes it even more impressive. Instead of relying primarily on special effects, the director actually attempts to generate excitement through the story, and it works. There are no lulls, no trite dialog, none of the usual filler that is normally found in Hollywood potboilers. Rather, the movie takes a simple, straightforward story and presents it to the audience. No frills, nothing fancy, just the story. And it is a compelling story, one that anyone in the audience will immediately understand and appreciate. Instead of challenging the audience to try to figure out the theme of the story, the story is completely transparent which adds to the movie's strength. Hollywood tends to go overboard in disaster movies. Too many special effects, lots of cheesy acting and sloppy dialog. None of that is in this movie. Denzel Washington gives an excellent performance as the train engineer and the rest of the cast is equally impressive. If you like high quality movies, then this movie is for you.",Unstoppable
62,dee.reid,"A brief ""Unstoppable"" review",7,27 October 2012,"I'm actually quite sure that in due time, the 2010 suspense action-thriller ""Unstoppable"" will undergo a slight critical re-evaluation, especially in the wake of the death of its director, action veteran Tony Scott (""True Romance,"" ""Top Gun,"" ""The Last Boy Scout""), earlier this year in August. The plot, based on a real-life event from 2001, concerns the numerous daring attempts by a veteran railway engineer, Frank Barnes (Denzel Washington), and his younger counterpart, newly hired train conductor Will Colson (Chris Pine), to stop a 39-car runaway train that is carrying a highly combustible payload before it reaches a heavily populated town in Pennsylvania. Like all of Scott's work, ""Unstoppable,"" like the runaway train at the center of its plot, moves at only two speeds - fast and fastest, with a lot of crazy camera-work and editing to accentuate the fast-moving action. And also like much of Scott's work, the action is so propulsive and the pacing so tight that things just really keep moving and moving. It's gripping, but never ever truly boring.7/10",Unstoppable
63,MaxBorg89,Tony Scott's train ride,6,5 December 2010,"Say what you want about Tony Scott and the overall quality of his body of work, but at least he's reliable when it comes to delivering spectacular action and good thrills, not to mention a fun performance from Denzel Washington, for whom Unstoppable is the fifth collaboration with the director. Sometimes, however, the basic ingredients aren't quite enough, as seen in Scott's previous film, the remake of The Taking of Pelham 123, whose train-based scenario is reworked in this new movie, which is partly based on a true story.The title might sound like a sci-fi story (that's what I believed when I first heard it, having no prior knowledge of the film's content), but it's actually about a speeding train that, unmanned and packed with lethal chemical products, could cause major damage throughout the populated areas nearby. The man upstairs (Kevin Dunn) is more concerned about financial consequences than human lives, and so it's up to an unlikely pair of heroes to try and stop the train: Frank Barnes (Washington), an engineer who thinks he doesn't have much to lose anyway, and Will Colson (Chris Pine), a young conductor with marital problems. Their only ally is yardmaster Connie Hooper, who provides updates and advice via radio frequencies.It all sounds very good, and yet the feeling remains that something went wrong along the way, starting with the material itself: despite the ""true story"" tag, the plot feels hollow and riddled with stereotypes, be it the incompetent boss or the ""old vs. young"" debate that stems from the team-up of Frank and Will. There's also a huge plausibility issue: sure, having live news coverage of the events is a valid storytelling device in terms of narrative vantage points, but who would actually send a news helicopter within 300 feet of something that is likely to blow up? Even by Hollywood standards, that's too much to ask for in the suspension of disbelief department.On the positive side, Washington is as charismatic as ever, Pine does a good down-to-earth version of his Captain Kirk, and Dawson gives valid support. The real triumph, though, is entirely behind the camera: an assured professional, Scott directs with passion an energy, infusing the key scenes with a vibrancy that, paired with his technical collaborators (most notably editor Chris Lebenzon and composer Harry Gregson-Williams), ensures that, when it's good, Unstoppable is quite a fun ride. Sadly, that doesn't occur all too often, and by the time the race comes to an end the picture has run out of steam as well. Perhaps the material was just too ""normal"" by the director's standards: where's a cartoonish villain when you need one?",Unstoppable
64,estebangonzalez10,Denzel and Scott on a train once again,8,23 January 2011,"¨This ain't training. In training they just give you an F. Out here you get killed!¨ It has been only a year since Denzel Washington last stared in a movie involving a train as the main protagonist. Even though he teamed up once again with director Tony Scott, this time it is a different train and a different character, not a sequel. This is a far superior movie as well and it will keep you at the edge of your seat from the very beginning. Pelham was more of a crime thriller, and Unstoppable is just a plain good action film. Once the runaway train with no one on board begins to pick up speed and become some sort of a chemical missile the movie will have hooked you and it will not let you go until the very end. There is not anything special or original about this movie, but it works really well thanks to Denzel Washington (who when it comes to action is always a very bankable star). Chris Pine (from Star Trek fame) is a pleasant surprise as well and he really gives an up to par performance with Washington, and the chemistry between both of them is great. They made for a surprisingly good duo and Mark Bomback's (Live Free or Die Hard) easy going believable script also helped make this film a pleasant movie going experience. The stars of the film are just two ordinary people who decide to take a huge risk in order to save thousands of lives, and everyone likes a story about heroes.The plot is pretty simple and the title of the film is pretty self explanatory: an unmanned half mile long train at increasing speed is just unstoppable. The movie is actually based on a real runaway train incident that occurred in Ohio in 2001, but of course Hollywood also has to add some ingredients to spice up the story. There is no way that oil/chemical storage tanks would be placed right under a curved bridge track (known as the Stanton Curve in this film). The story takes place in Pennsylvania where Frank (Denzel Washington), a veteran train engineer who has worked for the company for 28 years, has to team up for the day with Will Colson (Chris Pine) a young conductor with little field experience. In the meantime an incident has occurred in one of the tracks when Dewey (Ethan Suplee) accidentally leaves the brakes off a freight train carrying some sort of dangerous and explosive chemical, and the vehicle begins to pick up speed and head to a very populated town without anyone on board to stop it. Frank and Will are in the same track and decide to try to catch up to the runaway train in reverse in order to try to reduce its speed. It's a risky decision, but with the help of Connie (Rosario Dawson), the operator from the station with whom they communicate back and forth, they decide to try to stop the unstoppable.This is actually the fifth time that Tony Scott and Denzel Washington have collaborated together and they have made some great films (Man on Fire being by far my favorite one). Unstoppable is no exception and it works really well as an action film for several reasons. First of all we don't have any villains in this story. Everything that goes wrong is a result of human error and stupidity. There are very bad decisions made here and that is actually the way it is most of the time in the real world. An accident has occurred and now two ordinary people have to come together in order to try to become heroes. They have no super powers, they are simply trying to do the best they can in their everyday lives. Beside the great chemistry between the two main characters, there are also some good supporting characters like Rosario Dawson and Lew Temple who simply enhance the movie even more. Tony Scott's classic signature is all over this movie with shaky camera scenes and real action scenes (hardly no CGI is used) which give this film a more realistic feeling to it. The cinematography enhances the sense of urgency and speed of the train. Unstoppable was a very pleasant surprise and Scott knows how to make action movies, and having Denzel Washington on board is always a plus. Unstoppable is a simple movie that actually worked really well and I had a great time in the theater.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",Unstoppable

The train actually takes on a life of its own here and was sorta scary. Denzel plays an engineer and is well, all Denzelish.

All the secondary characters and sub stories are interesting here as well, including Rosario Dawson, Ethan Suplee as Dewy and ""Ned"" from the 'Walking Dead'. Surprisingly one of my least favourite characters here was Chris Pine as the young conductor ""Will"". His Performance was for the most part meh and his rekindled romance totally predictable. I did enjoy the climactic scene where he squishes his foot and hangs over the edge of the backwards moving train while being pummeled with grain though.

This is one hell of an exciting & suspense filled thrill ride with two great stars teamed up, Washington as as always great in his role & play's Frank as a nice, smart & decent older guy who is down on his luck & Chris Pine ( Wonder Woman, Smokin' Aces) plays the new young rookie named Will, a guy who has his own problems going on with his wife & both guys play well off each other & gradually as the ice breaks they start to actually like each other more & more as the movie fly's by & the danger worsens & they become the one's capable of stopping this Monster of a Train that's also carrying dangerous chemicals. Unstoppable is based on a true story so that adds to the tension & fear as this beast of a train flashes by & destroys anything in it's path.I really loved the look of this movie, the real colourful cinematography that's vibrant & popping with colour & richly textured grit, a good looking movie. Also Rosario Dawson (MIB 2, Seven Pounds) is really good here & gives a solid performance as Connie, telling our heroes what's happening from the radio. The action is fast, frantic & real, i also loved the beautiful Autumn Pennsylvania setting that's captured with that gorgeous cinematography.
A bumping thrilling score & a nice almost comforting little story about these two ordinary men in an extraordinary & extremely dangerous situation. I loved this movie & loved it's exciting atmosphere & heroic tone, we go on an adventure with two guys Frank & Will & that's what the movie is about & it's a fun, big budget popcorn Thriller fun.
Great stars & great chemistry.

69,NateWatchesCoolMovies,Tony's last :(,8,2 August 2016,"Tony Scott's Unstoppable was the maverick's last directorial outing before his heartbreaking and untimely death. It's ironic because the film's title is a descriptive term I would have applied to the man's career, life and approach to filmmaking. But it was not to be. This is some swan song of a film to go out on though, a pleasing juggernaut of an action drama that greases the tracks and goes full steam ahead. Any film about trains run amok will inevitably be compared to the 1984 masterpiece Runaway Train, and although this one is vastly different in both story and tone, they just seem to be sister films. The mournful, resolute nature of Jon Voight's character in it just seems to echo the sadness surrounding this film, and the fact that it was Tony's last. But that's just my strange intuition talking. The film itself isn't really melancholy or downbeat, in fact it focuses largely on human triumph in the face of gross error. There is in fact a runaway train on the loose here, but the stakes are upped when we find out that it's packed to the brim with highly toxic and flammable chemicals, and hurtling unchecked towards a densely populated metropolitan area. Denzel Washington is the Everyman veteran railroad worker, in danger of having his job devoured by greedy corporate development and ready to have a meltdown. Chris Pine is the hothead rookie swaggering through his first month on throb, and together they have to deal with the disaster, and prevent any further outcome. Rosario Dawson is the frantic control station operator, trying to coach two other workers (Lew Temple & Ethan Suplee) and help as best she can. Kevin Dunn is the abrasive company CEO, unwilling to get his hands dirty and callously looking for the first readily available solution, even if it results in mild casualties that he doesn't have to witness. It's all been done before, no doubt, but not by Scott, and you can never write off a formula, trope or act n cliché as dead until the maverick has had a good crack at it. The scenes involving the train are breathless and edited with a glass shard explosiveness, never to shaky or chaotic, always in control and bursting from the frames like the speeding locomotive they encompass. Look out for Jeff Wincott as Pine's older brother, as well as Kevin Corrigan, T.J. Miller and David Warshofsky as well. It's not a bad little flick for a director to put the final seal on his career with, and stands as a wrecking ball of an action flick. I just wish we got to see more from the guy. RIP Tony.",Unstoppable

71,Jonny_Numb,Loco Locomotive,7,26 November 2010,"From the moment I saw the trailer, I found the title laughably obvious: ""Unstoppable""? If the film's central conceit of an out-of-control locomotive barreling through southern Pennsylvania didn't eventually find a way to come to a halt, it would just as well be defeated by the closing-credits sequence. Grounded in the increasingly suspect ""Based on True Events"" claim, ""Unstoppable"" is, at its core, a surprisingly effective (and at times unbearably suspenseful) thriller that relies on sheer race-against-time velocity over violence to deliver a mostly unrelieved 98 minutes of nerve-racking tension. While the characters are familiar types (the Grizzled Veteran, the Hotheaded Rookie, the Private-Interests Executive, Mission Control), the actors invest a palpable energy and humanity that transcends cliché. Director Tony Scott, who has perpetrated more execrable, ADHD cinematic migraines than any other director over the past decade, admirably reins in his manic editing techniques and over-saturated neon color schemes in favor of a jerky, shaking camera that actually complements the increasingly out-of-control train (my only real objection would be his excessive, pointless use of zoom). ""Unstoppable"" is refreshingly entertaining -- a slice of old-school suspenseful filmmaking spiced up with contemporary technology.6.5 out of 10",Unstoppable
72,valleyjohn,Fails to make trains sexy.,4,15 January 2011,"Lets face it , Trains are not very interesting to most people. Unless you are one of those odd people who were born with a part off the brain that is damaged that makes them railway enthusiast or spotters. ( believe me i know a few!) . Because trains are the dullest form of transport , a film like Unstoppable was always going to struggle to be exciting and that's the case with this film. Despite having some talented actors like Denzel Washington and Chris Pine in the cast , this movie fails dismally to deliver and that's without mentioning the impossibilities that occur with this train. I think the reason being is that , one , a train cannot go anywhere other than the track it is on ( unlike Speed) and , two , railway talk is the perfect cure for insomnia. I really was hoping that Unstoppable was going to be the film that made trains sexy but Sadly it didn't.",Unstoppable
73,Samiam3,Medium good (feels under done though),6,13 November 2010,"Unstoppable reminds me of Edwin S. Porter (The Great Train Robbery). Porter is arguably the father of editing, and was the first filmmaker to use such a device to tell multiple stories at the same time. A hundred and ten years later, such an innovation is no less important, and it's hard to imagine movies like Unstopabble working without it.Tony Scott's latest movie concerns a runaway train in Pennsylavia which is heading towards civilization carrying several cars of toxic substance. The shipping company's attempts to stop the train prove futile, so a veteran engineer and his rookie conductor go after the train on their own.One could easily argue that Unstoppable is a nail-biter, but somehow it down't feel sufficient. What at first sounds like a promising realistic version of what Michael Bay and Roland Emmerich try to do, ends up feeling standard, formula driven, and surprisingly short. There is too little in the way of character and there are too many badly scripted lines. Scott's camera work is phenomenal and he is able to generate some suspense here and there, but nothing that is consistent or superior to the film's predecessors. Ironically, Unstoppable actually reminded me of how good Bay and Emmerich used to be. As dumb as Armageddon and/or Independence Day were, their adrenaline was top notch.Unstopable essentially needs to push a little harder. It just doesn't feel like as big a spectacle or as strong a drama as it could've been. To say there isn't a dull moment just does quite cut it. The movie is watchable, sometimes enjoyable, but not very filling.",Unstoppable

75,SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain,Unstoppable (2010),7,26 December 2011,"Unstoppable was a movie with no point other than to entertain its audience. It managed to have a bit more emotion invested in its two main characters. Washington as a struggling father who forgets birthdays and Pine whose own family problems are mysterious at first. The film perfectly captures the generational gap between these two. Pine is Washington's superior despite lack of experience. His education has elevated him to his new position. However, Washington isn't simply some bitter veteran of the trade. He has more fun teasing Pine and realises that Pine's own need to prove himself will cause him to mess up. As these two characters are established, a runaway train is hurtling towards a small town, and a curve that will surely derail it. Oh, and it's carrying dangerous material. Yikes! What I liked best about this film is that all the action builds up without the inclusion of the two protagonists. They are merely in a character piece, until their own train is in danger of being hit. This means when their attempts to stop the train take place, we are already familiar and connected to them both. The action is clearly more practical than we are used to these days and it certainly adds to the danger of it all. Scott also uses some self control and perfects the techniques he has used excessively over his last few efforts. The film has tension, emotion, and little bits of humour scattered here and there. The only point where it fell into cliché for me, was the big bad corporation angle, that are willing to risk everybody's lives to reduce the negative press. A bit too ""Boo Hiss"" in an otherwise well rounded action film.",Unstoppable
76,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,A (mostly) realistic edge of your seat thriller that is The Fast and the Furious (2001) for train junkies,8,29 June 2015,"As much as not all-regular commuters take the train on a daily basis, the railroad has always been an important asset to various interests since its commencement during the 1800s. Whether its passenger or freight trains, railways are one of the biggest systems of transportation for anything that needs a direct way of travel. However, this complicated arrangement of simultaneous operations would not work right or be safe enough for anyone to be apart of if it were not for the array of classes that specialize in this field. The train engineer, conductor, signalman, stationmaster and so on all have to coordinate exactly by the book because if one thing is left unchecked, several severe consequences can arise. One of which is loss of property and that is no loose change purchase. It's one of those jobs where if you screw up once, there's really no way your going to be getting a second chance.The plot to this ""you can't afford to be lazy"" thriller is when station master Connie (Rosario Dawson) and her boss Galvin (Kevin Dunn) find out that a rather unqualified train engineer (Ethan Suplee) managed to lose control of a mile long freight train out the yard and onto the public railway line. As soon as this occurs, chaos and mass hysteria ensues for somewhere along the line comes a sharp curve that lies over a populated city that the train won't be able to make. Despite this major problem there are people who can help. Frank Barns (Denzel Washington) a 28-year veteran of the railway and greenthumb Will Colson (Chris Pine) team up to try and slow down the runaway train. Directed by genre action/thriller veteran Tony Scott, once the train leaves the yard the pacing does not slow down from there and rightfully so. Written by Mark Bomback (Live Free or Die Hard (2007)), which was adapted from an actual event that occurred almost a decade before, this intense thriller is one of those cautionary tales about how detrimental one slip can be if your not careful enough (whether it was intentional or not).Aside from how quickly paced scenes move in this film, there are a number of scenes for character development. Because there are moments that involve trains catching up to each other, this allows room for Frank and Will to talk and emote to each other about their separate lives and what they are currently dealing with. Frank is a widower with two daughters trying to make it through college and Will is a guy who's been put on a restraining order for a rash decision he made. Although at times these two characters bicker they do have heart and that makes them likable. This is important for main characters. Even Connie (Dawson) who comes off as hot headed at times is a sympathetic character because her situation is just as critical as the person whose trying to stop the train. Also, Dawson's knowledge of train terminology is astounding (apparently she has railroad experience in real life). Even for actor Kevin Dunn, who normally plays parent roles plays his character the right way, which represents how business leadership can become tainted over time.As for the set pieces, there's something to admire about how real this film feels. For a plot that is described as extremely hazardous, it is amazing that a number of the action sequences were done live. Could you imagine being on a runaway diesel train with 30+ cars on the back end? What's great specifically about the runaway train is about how it's portrayed. Whenever the train appears on screen, it screams metallic echoes that are a bit terrifying even from a passive point of view (from not literally being there). Envision the power behind all that weight and then speed it up,...it is literally a monster that is indestructible. The only visual elements that seem illogical are mostly the technical parts. For majority of the time, the special effects are kept to a minimum but there is one scene that looks like it wasn't touched up as nicely as it could've been. Also like a lot of action films, sometimes the laws of physics are blown off just to have the film go a certain way and here is no different. Some things just shouldn't be possible.The other two components that work in this film's favor however are its cinematography and music. The director of photography was handled by Ben Seresin best known for shooting Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen (2009) a year before and went on to shoot for Pain & Gain (2013) and World War Z (2013). Much of Seresin's work has great wide-angle shots of terrain, sky and the rail lines. When it comes to a film like this where everything is on the move, it is definitely important for the viewer to have an understanding of geography within the story and Seresin is able to display that efficiently. The music composed by Harry Gregson- Williams was also a surprise. Although there isn't a truly recognizable theme for the runaway train other than staccotoed notes randomly throughout the score, Williams does have a theme for Frank and Will which to be quite honest is the best tune. The motif is lightly played on the piano and it has real emotion. The action cues do its job at hightening the experience of tension but it isn't as thematically integrated when being listen to alone.Aside from having some implausible physics and undoctored special effects in a few areas, this thriller goes beyond comfortability with its suburban setting and realistic dangers of what happens when someone isn't paying attention. The actors perform well, the writing develops them nicely, the music gives the right amount of emotion, the cinematography and practical set pieces make it all the more real.",Unstoppable
77,Matt_Layden,Speed on a train.,7,2 April 2011,"Despite the film being clichéd to the teeth and having characters that no one could give a damn about, the film will most likely win you over. Tony Scott and Denzel Washington team up yet again in this nail bitter of a thriller that has Washington and Chris Pine doing their best to try and stop an unmanned runaway train. The bigger problem is that the train has some explosive chemicals on it that could level a city or two. The film is loosely based on real events (aren't they all). Washington plays the old timer who is being forced into retirement to make way for some new blood, new blood like Chris Pine. So already we have some character friction between the two main leads. Cookie-cutter stuff to be honest. They both have their own personal problems, Denzel hasn't been the best father and his daughters don't seem to really care for him. Pine has his wife/girlfriend serving him with a restraining order, to stay away from her and their kid. He's not that bad of a guy, it was just a misunderstanding. Pine and Washington have some casual banter between the two, bickering at each other here and there, it's all comical for the audience. Meanwhile a train gets loose due to human error. Basically there are two dumbwits who let it go. Despite the train being on a single set of tracks, it manages to cause quite a bit of damage.Scott employs his usual directing style here, quick zooms onto character faces during basic conversations to somehow make a simple scene seem more energetic. It's not as irksome as in Domino and it actually seems to work for the film. The real stars of the film are the stunt and pyrotechnic team, both working together to create some real entertaining moments in an exciting film. You'll know how the film ends and you'll know that this one event somehow makes years of problems go away from these two characters. Everyone loves a hero right? So their family problems will be solved, any job problems will be solved and everyone will be happy, if they stop the train that is. The movie is more fun than you'd expect, it''s competently done and has more positives than negatives. I can easily recommend Unstoppable for those looking for some nice escapism.",Unstoppable
78,lewiskendell,More like a runaway hit than a train wreck.,7,14 November 2010,"""We're not just taking about a train here, we're talking about a missile the size of the Chrysler Building.""I have to admit that Unstoppable was a pretty exciting movie. I had wondered prior to seeing it the tension and excitement of a runaway train could be sustained for an hour and a half without it becoming tiresome, but this movie pulled it off very well. There's always some new development or danger coming up, and the pacing is excellent. If you liked Speed, you'll like Unstoppable. As for the actors, everyone was good. Chris Pine and Denzel Washington didn't really become the central focus of the film until around the halfway mark, but when their confrontation with the runaway train began in earnest, it was riveting. Rosario Dawson was convincing as the harried station chief trying to keep control of the situation.My one real complaint may or may not be an issue for you, depending on your opinion of Tony Scotf's directing style. His hyper-kinetic camera movements and quick cuts are on full display, here, and I really didn't think they were very necessary. I actually felt that at times the camera-work was downright distracting, and took attention away from what was actually happening on the screen. I'm not against this kind of stuff in general, but Unstoppable would have been even better with a steadier view of the action.It may be autumn, but Unstoppable has more than enough  in its tank to satisfy any craving for excitement you may have left over from the summer movie season.

An engineer and his conductor find themselves in a race against time. (Firm Films)UNSTOPPABLE is what you would expect a film to be with this title: It's a nonstop thrill ride, once it gets going. Director Tony Scott and actor Denzel Washington team up for the fifth time and it turns out that this is one of their better films. Yes, the Scott-editing style is still here, with the flashy/blurry, late-time reaction as if someone overdosed on cocaine (I wouldn't know), as well as the cinematography constantly swerving around every actor in almost every scene, but I didn't mind them much here. The techniques are more appropriate this time around.There's also a great, if flawed, script and strong characters, albeit not the best development in film history. Denzel Washington is excellent as always, although playing the exact same character in his previous works with Scott. Having Chris Pine play alongside him puts a fresh spin in the situation. He's also really good in his role. I also liked Rosario Dawson, but I loved her in everything she was in so take that with a grain of salt.I don't know if people will agree with me, but I liked the fact how the film relied heavily on human errors for it to keep going. Honestly, the characters try almost every way possible to stop the train but there's always a small mishap that just ruins the plan. I also liked how the news media played a huge role in the film, to explain to the audience what is happening and to simplify the situation for us. It's much easier to digest than the train/railroad jargon the characters in the film discuss with each other. The lack of CGI and reliance on practical effects also is a huge plus because it makes everything so much more realistic, gritty, and intense.Overall, UNSTOPPABLE has a great cast, good script, and nail-biting tension throughout. The SPEED comparison is inevitable so I'll just say it's as good and as entertaining as SPEED. If you like a fast paced thrill ride, UNSTOPPABLE is the film for you.",Unstoppable

81,bob-rutzel-1,What a Ride !,7,21 February 2011,"Engineer Frank Barnes (Washington) and Conductor Will Colson ( Pine) attempt to stop a runaway train in Pennsylvania loaded with hazardous and combustible materials. Inspired by a true story that happened in Ohio, not Pennsylvania in 2001. Known as the CSX 8888 Incident or the Crazy Eights Incident. The runaway train was number 8888.In the beginning there is a carload of children getting their first ride on a train. It is here that we think the children have a link with the runaway train. It is also here that we hope that is not the case and if true, should we watch the rest of the way? How it all started: an engineer climbs out of his cab in the yard to correct a track switch and leaves the throttle on. And, now we have a movie inspired by true events in 2001.All is good with the production: the acting, dialogue, cinematography, photography, actual stunts with trains, CGI and the pace. There are a couple side plots: Frank forgets his daughter's birthday and she isn't happy about that; Will is separated from his wife and there is a restraining order on him in effect.Even though we hope and believe things will come out okay, there is still a lot of tension and suspense throughout. The action scenes whether via CGI or actual stunts are simply terrific. In a way, I am glad this wasn't a 3-D production. As mentioned above the incident happened in Ohio, not in Pennsylvania but the only reason I can see for the setting in PA is there were more towns to go thru in PA than in Ohio and this made for better crises scenes with those towns being evacuated and people lining up to watch the runaway train. Also, there is an elevated curvy track coming into Scranton, PA and the CGI really earns its praise here when you see the train engine wheels coming off one side of the tracks as the train rounds the curve. Great scene. Anyway, this is a very exciting movie and after it's all done, you will feel like you just ran a mile with a 50-lb backpack.. uphill. Whew! What a ride!Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No.",Unstoppable
82,moviexclusive,Tony Scott's high-octane action keeps the film relentlessly intense and gripping from start to finish,7,3 November 2010,"If you've read the synopsis above, you pretty much know the long and short of Tony Scott's ""Unstoppable"". Based on the real-life story of an unmanned train that went careening down the tracks in Ohio after a railroad employee failed to set the air brakes while switching tracks, this dramatization of that little incident amps up the thrills for a white-knuckle 100-minute non-stop roller-coaster ride- just think of it as an adrenaline shot that pretty much grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go from start to finish.The setup is plain and simple- on one end of the track is rookie conductor Will Colson (Chris Pine), paired with veteran railroad engineer Frank Barnes (Denzel Washington) on his first day of work. Frank and Will each have their own share of family problems and each bear their own reservations of the other- so there's a fair bit of tension between the two of them as they begin their shift, especially since Will is seen as the company's new blood employed to replace the older workers (including Frank) who have one by one been forced to retire.Then on the other end of the track, some bumbling employee gets off a train in an attempt to switch tracks, puts the stick in throttle and sends the massive locomotive whizzing down rural Pennsylvania towards the more heavily populated areas. Corporate- represented by Kevin Dunn's VP of operations- and local ground operations- represented by Rosario Dawson's rail commander- can't agree how to stop it, the former as usual weighing the options in terms of dollars and cents on the stock market.It is only halfway through the film that Frank and Will cross paths with said locomotive nicknamed ""The Beast"" and come out with a plan to link their engine to the back to it and gun it in the opposite direction. Tony Scott spends the first half of the film doing two things- one, emphasising the working-class backgrounds of Frank and Will; and two, laying out bare the peril of the situation. Both are deftly played for the nail-biting finish, which is guaranteed to leave you wide-eyed and open-mouthed.By portraying Frank and Will's as everyday men with real concerns over livelihood and family, Scott and ""Die Hard 4.0"" writer Mark Bomback make the point loud and clear later on that that real-life heroes are really just ordinary men who do extraordinary acts of courage in the face of danger and calamity. Indeed, though it is apparent that both Frank and Will are the heroes of the story, playing down the chest-thumping heroics of their act proves to be a wise choice in painting them as regular people who rose to the occasion to save the lives of thousands, including their families and loved ones.Scott instead stresses the magnitude of the occasion in repeated failed attempts at halting ""The Beast"", each and every attempt highlighting the destructive force of the locomotive at that weight and at that speed. Choosing to film the high-octane action sequences in a more straightforward realistic manner than his usual flashy visual style (i.e. jump cuts, shaky camera, zooms and colour-correction) also lends the proceedings an authentic and an altogether genuinely riveting feel, further underlining the gravity of their heroic act. Special mention goes to the sound design of the film, which in a proper theatre with good sound system will set the hall rumbling with the sound of the locomotive.Because much of the focus of the film is on ""The Beast"", more screen time seems to be dedicated to the train than to our two lead actors, Denzel Washington and Chris Pine. Still, the ever-reliable Denzel Washington delivers a low-key but no less commanding performance as the dutiful railroad worker Frank. He also shares a nice buddy chemistry with Chris, and it's interesting to watch how the initial tension between the two gives way to mutual cooperation, understanding and finally respect.Unfolding at a breathless pace, Tony Scott makes the most of a simple premise to deliver a relentlessly exciting action movie that plays like ""Speed"" on tracks. It wastes no time in getting to the meat of the action, and doesn't once let up right until the end of the thrill ride. In between, you get the story of two men, folks like you and I, who display an outstanding act of heroism when faced with imminent danger. Precisely because they are so relatable, ""Unstoppable"" becomes so much more gripping, and you'd be advised that this high-octane action movie is just the adrenaline fix you need for the week.",Unstoppable

So, when Tony Scott combines these disparate true events into a disaster movie, we get the disastrously bad Unstoppable. The whole thing is so slap-dash, so formulaic, so cynical that you might not even notice how ADHD the movie is. We've gone far beyond the MTV editing of the 1980s; Unstoppable reaches a point of frenetic flash-cutting that literally impedes the narrative. I found myself mouthing ""stop doing that"" when Scott gets the average shot time down to a quarter of a nanosecond. There are whole big swaths of story in Unstoppable that simply make no sense, primarily because it's just assumed that the average audience member has the attention span of a gnat.One with ADHD.",Unstoppable
89,antoniotierno,unlikely but pretty enjoyable,7,27 November 2010,"This Tony Scott's Unstoppable is the sort of movie easily definable as improbable (though based on a true event occurred in 2001), its plot (with runaway locomotive bearing down hazardous materials on an urban center populated by massive fuel containers..) being too full of absurdities. However Denzel Washington's performance's always bringing integrity and completion to anything he does. In this case his presence is also vital to the story. Solid as usual, Denzel has us sympathizing with him and with his co-worker. Therefore the human element he provides (as well as Rosario Dawson's acting) makes the improbable action even worthwhile. The movie gets eventually to provide the thrills and some good pieces of entertainment. So it works, with an adrenaline rush lasting for the whole runtime and having the viewer wondering what's happening next in every scene. I have laughed at the ludicrousness of some scenes but overall this action packed flick is highly entertaining.",Unstoppable

I love stories of train: historial films like ""Bataille du rail of René Clément (1946) and ""The Train"" of John Franknheimer (1964) with Burt Lancaster, Paul Scofield and Jeanne Moreau , thrillers like ""Runaway train "" of Andrej Konchalovskyi (1985) with Jon Voigt and Eric Roberts or comedies like ""Closly Warched Trains (Ostre sledované vlaky) of Jiri Menzel (1966) and ""Bébert et l'omnibus"" (Bebert and the Train) of Yves Robert (1963) !!

91,TheUnknown837-1,It works on the principles of late afternoon escapism and it's an efficient nail-biter.,8,7 December 2010,"Even though I did not care whatsoever for the fates of any of the stick-figure characters that populate Tony Scott's new movie ""Unstoppable"" and despite the fact that I still have some qualms with his directing style, I must confess that this new runaway-train movie won me over. It works on the principles of late afternoon escapism and it's quite efficient as a nail-biter. Kicking off to big bursts of kinetic action almost right from the beginning and lasting for a taut ninety-eight minutes, it proved itself as one of the more wholesomely entertaining action movies I've seen in the last half of the year.The movie is based (loosely) on the CSX 8888 incident of 2001, in which a freight train ran amok and unmanned across the state of Ohio for two hours. Here the setting is switched to Pennsylvania and it's running at such high speeds that it threatens to destroy Stanton should it derail itself on an elevated railway and smash its toxic cargo. Of course, for the conventions of the action/escapism movie plot, we've got two troubled heroes who are just going through the motions of their not-so-happy lives when they assume the Superman personality and race against time to stop the train.The train is the real star of the movie. More interesting than the people trying to control it. Director Tony Scott gives us several impressive and creative shots of the half-mile-long mechanical monster as it rampages around. Listen carefully to the soundtrack and amongst all the crashes and grinding sounds you'll hear noises reminiscent of the tyrannosaurus in Steven Spielberg's ""Jurassic Park."" The movie almost seems like a big-budget homage to Spielberg's early-career movie ""Duel"" in which you had an innocent man being pursued by a giant tractor-trailer.The characters are modeled after Action Movie 101 Writing stereotypes. You know, the veteran and the rookie. One of them is splitting up with his wife, the other is having a hard time maintaining a relationship with his daughters. You've got the noble yardmaster wanting to save lives and the greedy, vulgarity-spitting corporate executive whose more concerned about how much dough he's lost. And, of course, it takes a major catastrophe in which lives are risked in order to glue everything back together again. And no, morbid as it sounds, I didn't care who lived and who died.However, *however* the filmmakers are smart enough to play with this to their advantage. They do not waste any more time than they really need to with this flat caricatures and instead devote as much of the brief running time as they can to very gritty action sequences. I must commend Mr. Scott for his ability to coordinate his pyrotechnics crew. Although I still detest his overly extravagant dolly shots and irksome ""quick zooms"" (in which the camera inches in and out of people for no reason at all) he does hold your attention when letting loose a wave of inertia. The last quarter of the movie is consumed by an enormous, very intense action sequence that develops suspense and nail-biting tension reminiscent of ""Back to the Future."" Complications are thrown in and as they kept on coming, I gradually discovered myself nervously toying with the zipper of my jacket. He also does a fantastic job of balancing sequences with ""Live Television"" shots as news cameras record the incident.""Unstoppable"" is not a work of art, but heck, it's not trying to be. Movies are meant to be one of two things: art or escapism. ""Unstoppable"" is the latter. It achieves exactly what it is targeting: ninety-eight minutes of blood-pumping action, smart-alec dialogue, and a barrel of fun for all who participate. It's more fun (and less painful, for me) than any roller coaster I can remember being on at the fair. On the basis of it being a solid matinée thriller, I liked the movie.Denzel Washington, as the wise old train veteran, is his usual self: sincere and convincing. Chris Pine is also in fine form as the goodhearted but troubled rookie whom he finds himself both bickering and laughing with. Rosario Dawson, an underrated actress, turns in another strong performance as the yardmaster supervising the disaster. And Kevin Dunn is sinister despite the two-dimensional character he's given to play. Supporting roles are played mechanically but well by Ethan Suplee, Meagan Tandy, Elizabeth Mathis, and Jessy Schram.P.S., the movie almost shoots itself in the foot at the end, but just ignore that, as everything before it works just fine.",Unstoppable
92,IonicBreezeMachine,A simple but effective 90 minute rollercoaster ride,7,12 April 2021,"Set in Pennsylvania, AWVR Train #777, a train hauling hazardous chemicals, goes out of control after an oversight but the engineer leaves the cab unoccupied and stuck at full throttle. Now 28 year railroad veteran Frank Barnes (Denzel Washington), untested rookie, Will Colson (Chris Pine), and yardmaster Connie Hooper (Rosario Dawson) must try and stop this out of control train before it crashes with disastrous results.Released in 2010, the movie is actually based on the CSX 8888 incident (aka Crazy Eights) where a train carrying phenol also went out of control. Various details from the real event are used (such as the police's attempt to shoot the fuel release button) but while some details are kept there's a number of details inserted for dramatic effect. The movie is notable for being the final film of Tony Scott before his suicide and fifth collaboration with Denzel Washington. While Unstoppable isn't Scott's best movie, it is still an entertaining ride from start to finish.The movie is actually fairly unique in terms of blockbuster action movies in that its setting in the rust belt areas of Pennsylvania and a smaller scale story involving working class people who aren't typical guns blazing devil may care action protagonists makes the film feel fairly grounded for a movie of this type. Tony Scott efficiently and effectively introduces and sets up the scenario, characters, and relationships but doesn't leave anything feeling rushed or under done. When the movie starts, not unlike the train it doesn't stop until it's stopped. The movie views the train from every possible direction, be it the boots on the ground, the managers tracking the rail systems, the regional directors, and even the high level executives who are busy golfing as this goes on. We also get some well utilized viewpoints from the community and local news covering the action from multiple angles.There's really not all that much in the way of ""substance"" with unstoppable, bor is there much depth to it either. The movie does try to shine a light on ageism in working environments with Washington's character Barnes having been forced into ""Retirement"" with half benefits and it makes a good point for Washington and Pine to bounce off each other and they have really good chemistry, but it's not lingered on too long as the movie is more concerned with matching the speed of the runaway train than doing any in depth character analysis.Unstoppable knows what it is and doesn't try to be anything else. It's an above average disaster movie that gives its audience likable protagonists who rather than relying on choreographed stunts or expensive fantastical gadgets need to rely on their prowess and ingenuity to save the day.",Unstoppable

They are all interesting, cool, short lasting, mysterious, scientific. All I wanted to see. Nice presence of police, news, bosses, wives, workers, and other people. Perfect presence of vehicles, especially that 3 helicopters and at least 3 trains. Emotional, humane, inspirational. The presence of few negative outcomes makes this more realistic. Similar to real life bad news like accidents. Gives us insight into various jobs. Better and more positive than some train thrillers like The Taking of Pelham 123 (2009). At the end there is bit of feeling that there is something missing, but that is acceptable because movie is short and it is realistic.

Only an senior engineer Frank could stop it with his idea, which he implied after his 28 years experience of in rail service. You can enjoy this train thriller from very first frame and you would not wish to stop until the end. However a very little bit part of the movie in middle trails boring. But it is ignorable. Climax is interesting. Emotions of new employee and old employee are described very well. Family tension of both you will feel sympathy. Some greediness of upper officers in railway is also you can watch. Good plot. Another significant area is photography. Magnificent camerawork gives you a good look of train thriller. And with brilliant direction makes you feel actual train drama as real. Background sound is perfect and will impress you. Acting side is very well. Denzel Washington is perfect in his senior engineer's role while Chris pine is also good in his assistant engineer' job. Another memorable role by Rosario Dawson in her role of head of railway department. Must watch for good train thriller.

96,thekarmicnomad,Refreshingly Old School,7,2 December 2014,"This is a disaster movie like the ones I watched as a kid so I was right at home here.Basically, a train runs off on its own and -as the title suggests- no one can stop it.In my youth film goers had quite low expectations. You didn't expect to see a meteor crash into the White House or see an A level actress's side-boob - they were treats. Generally you hoped to see some good acting and some stuff happen.That's what you get here. If you are an action junkie and you demand to be kept on the edge of your seat is suspense or blasted into the back rest with stunning affects then give this a miss.I enjoyed it because it was low key and moments of drama are squeezed out of sequences that your typical Statham character would consider a lunch break.Good acting, good affects, story is minimal but used economically.

97,phubbs,Unstoppable,7,23 November 2014,"Well those Scott brothers sure know how to make rip roaring films don't they. I went into this with lots of mixed feelings, its about a runaway train...hardly the stuff of great films is it and I've seen a few similar average films in the past, hell the title is even a bit lame really isn't it. I couldn't really think how Mr Scott could make this bluecollar job look cool but by jove he did. Lets see now...he's made the Underground/Subway look cool, working on board a submarine look cool (although it is kinda cool really isn't it but I bet you never thought about it before his movie). Stock car driving now looks cool and making all fighter pilots look like young handsome brooding studs. Well now its the turn of the humble loco driver to be uber cool.From the outset the way the loco gets loose and goes on the run is laughable to be honest. I dunno if this happens in the US a lot (scary if it does, this is based on a real event!!) but the way everyone seems to think its funny and not a problem that a loco is unmanned and running away is frankly bizarre. I imagine the practice of getting out of your cab to swing points whilst the train is still moving has been stopped.As the story develops we do get the typical Scott direction of trying to make us think that working in a loco yard (train driver/shunter) is cool. Its filmed with dramatic angles, sexy lighting, quickfire editing and plenty of in-house railway jargon that some won't follow but it sounds good. Somehow all the grunting cocky cowboy-like drivers, a sexy controller and the fast talking hip engineers doesn't really match reality, you can see Scott is eager to sex-up this field of work in his usual style. There should have been more shades worn in this.Little silly niggles aside the film is a spectacular affair with sweaty tense action and thundering collisions that look really expensive and make you wince. They seemed to be using real loco's here as I saw no CGI used anywhere, all very impressive stunts. Location work is beautiful too I might add, rural US of A with the lovely foliage of Virginia. Scott knows how to make a gritty fast film and this delivers on every level I assure you. Despite the rather dated plot concept and very obvious conclusion the film is terrific fun and will have you biting your nails to the last second...despite knowing damn well they will succeed. His usual choice of actor Washington is on board and he adds that perfect rundown regular Joe quality to the film with his usual stoic performance. Pine is also fine but can't quite match Washington for realism in the job, plus he looks too heroic really, way too buff for this.Only problem is, the way they manage to actually stop the loco, they could of done that at any point at anytime as far as I can tell. The whole time your thinking why not just do that? All you need is a fast car...then they do it at the end and I was like...duh!Even though the movie is based on a real event its easy to forget and it does come across like a full blown action thriller. The movie is promoted as such and it does deliver on all accounts...even though you know what's gonna happen. Throw a few terrorists into the fray and you would have had 'Die Hard' on a locomotive. All aboard for a chuffing good ride (pun fully intended).7/10",Unstoppable
98,KnightsofNi11,Just another action flick...,5,21 August 2011,"Here's the latest action exploit from one of the most stereotypical action directors working in show business today, Tony Scott, brother of the much more acclaimed Ridley Scott. Unstoppable is a story about a runaway train tearing through Pennsylvania at breakneck speeds. Denzel Washington and Chris Pine play the two conductors who take it upon themselves to stop this train when all other strategies fail. The film switches frenetically from the train to the railroad central, to the corporate office, to the various towns the runaway train passes through, and to another train full of school children that one would assume serves a purpose, but it doesn't. It's something that is forgotten the farther into the movie we go and the more branches and subplots that stem from the array of characters this convoluted film presents. Unstoppable can't keep its storyline structured and coherent enough to really mean anything, and what we are left with is another clichéd and easily forgettable action flick.There seems to be no originality left in Tony Scott's mind. Every one of his films tends to be the same exact formula with the same exact look and feel. The music is identical, the story follows the same basic path, the cinematography is exactly the same, and the acting and dialogue is in the exact same style from film to film. Unstoppable presents absolutely nothing new. It plays out exactly how one would expect and with all the smaller elements that play up a totally unoriginal atmosphere that we've seen countless times before from this director. If you've seen Scott's The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3 then you've pretty much seen Unstoppable. Creativity is a dwindling thing in Hollywood, and Unstoppable proves that.What annoys me most about a film like this is probably the wasted potential that I see on screen. Unstoppable has the workings of an interesting story. The idea of a runaway train could have created something much more thrilling and engaging if done right. But in the context of this film we know exactly how it is going to pan out. Then there's the actors in the film which all do a great job. Denzel Washington is as good as always, and Chris Pine holds his own despite being an incredibly lame character with the most obvious and clichéd back story imaginable. The film really just turns into more of the same action nonsense we see so much, especially in the way it is shot. I disliked most of the things about this film, but the one thing I truly hated was Scott's direction. The film is rife with the shaky cam stupidity that just confuses us and loses us more than entertain and engages us. It, again, doesn't make the film unique in any way. It just makes it frustrating and silly.There are some nice things here but, overall, Unstoppable is a very dumb film that amounts to a whole lot of nothing. I didn't outright hate the film and I saw plenty of moments in it where I would have been much more excited and engaged had this film possessed even an inkling of creativity. It's just another action movie. It's not terrible but it is absolutely nothing special. I would definitely skip this movie and seek out something with a few more brain cells and a broader imagination.",Unstoppable

100,ajs-10,A well made action thriller from Tony Scott,7,12 November 2011,"I remember there was quite a lot of debate about this one when it came out but it managed to evade my attention until now. Much of the debate centred around the fact that this was just another Tony Scott action thriller. Well, in that respect they were correct, a Tony Scott action thriller is what it is. To be fair though, it doesn't pretend to be anything else. Scott is very practiced at the action thriller and he does do it rather well so I guess the debate could have centred around when Scott was going to make a comedy or something like that instead. I will give you my take on it after this very brief summary A freight train carrying a very hazardous cargo manages to escape the clutches of its' driver and heads off down the track at full power with no brakes. I won't bore you with the details of how this happened, but rest assured it's a series of very unfortunate events and quite a chunk of incompetence. The train yard supervisor, Connie, sets the wheels in motion to retrieve the train but it's too late, it's headed for a populated area with seemingly no means of stopping it. Meanwhile, rookie conductor Will and his veteran driver Frank are moving freight in the opposite direction. Can they avoid this out-of-control train and what's more, is there any way they can stop it before it meets with disaster? Well, you can probably guess the Spoiler Police are standing right behind me right now with pick-axe handles just waiting for me to type the wrong words. Fear for my safety ensures I will say no more on the matter.It's all very well made with some spectacular action sequences and beautifully realised visuals throughout. All the performances were decent although nobody was really stretched. Honourable mentions go to; Denzel Washington as Frank, Chris Pine as Will, Rosario Dawson as Connie, Ethan Suplee as Dewey, Kevin Dunn as Galvin, Kevin Corrigan as Inspector Werner and Lew Temple as Ned.As I've already said, it's a very well made film with plenty of action and some great thrills. The trouble is, I've seen it all before. If it was the first action thriller I'd ever seen I'm sure I would have been enthralled, but sadly it wasn't. I found it a little too predictable, although I did find myself rooting for our hero (or heroes no clues) at the end. There are subplots about corporate responsibility and the back stories of Will and Frank fill in a bit, but I never really cared that much for the characters and the sense of threat to the town in the path of this runaway train wasn't really conveyed very well. We did get a sense of the power of the train, but the real threat was supposed to be the cargo and that avenue was never really explored to any extent. Over all though, a very well made film that is great to look at but doesn't really hold the audience in the way a film like this should. Having said that, it's worth a viewing just the one though.My score: 6.7/10 IMDb Score: 6.8/10 (based on 49,694 votes at the time of going to press).",Unstoppable
101,johnstonjames,"Exciting, Believable, Realistic",7,15 November 2011,"the thing i like about the Scott brothers is that their movies are always realistic and believable. even when they are far out sci-fi speculation like 'Blade Runner', they are at least convincing.this movie incorporated the usual realism that Tony Scott is noted for. the action seemed a lot more reality based than a lot of the action you normally see on television or in movies like 'X Men' or 'Batman' or the over the top '2012'.you don't have to suspend much belief to accept much of the action here. anyone who has a vague idea of how machinery and equipment operates will identify this as a good enough depiction of reality.one of the most realistic things here is the statement of heroes being real life working joes. the protagonist are not some larger than life supermen but instead they are over worked and understaffed union employees for a hard driven railroad company. a scenario that is probably familiar to many real life persons in America. the train isn't some target of a major terrorist plot or anything, it just happens to get away from a tired, overweight, overworked, employee who probably had one too many brews the night before. it was equally real and amusing that Rosario Dawson as the supervisor knew the name of the chemical being transported but didn't really have any idea what it actually was or it's effects.action movies would do themselves a service to try to emulate the realism of Tony and Ridley Scott more often. it would lead to less juvenile idiocy in mainstream filmmaking. i would have given this film more than a seven because it was exciting and entertaining, but i didn't think the content warranted that much recognition.",Unstoppable
102,Likes_Ninjas90,"Through his structural and aesthetic techniques, Scott shows very little faith in his audience.",5,29 January 2011,"Rookie train driver Will (Chris Pine), straight from training, is brought into a rail yard where there is increasing pressure on the older drivers who are being made redundant. He is taken under the wing by straight talking Frank (Denzel Washington), who understands how unforgiving the job can be. After a mistake from one of the younger drivers, a train carrying deadly toxic chemicals is left unmanned and takes off down the tracks by itself. Yardmaster Connie (Rosario Dawson) is one of the main women working on the problem but she continues to lock horns with her own boss Galvin (Kevin Dunn), who is unwilling to derail the train given how much time and money it will cost his company. Working against the orders of Galvin, Will and Frank must cooperate together and try and get back onboard the runaway to stop it before it reaches Will's home area. Director Tony Scott doesn't find any subtly in trains. Filming in Pennsylvania, he's used real locomotives instead of CGI ones to give texture to the weight and movement of the machines. However, this is where the film's authenticity ends. Although Unstoppable is loosely based on a true story, Mark Bomback's script makes this a very safe trip. The film has been contextually and politically simplified. Job redundancy could not be a more timely issue but the film exploits it for cheap emotion and implausible action scenarios. Take when the evil Galvin orders one of his ageing train drivers to use his vehicle to slowdown the runaway locomotive. It's a chance for Scott to include at least one more explosion in his movie and Connie is left to cry out 'damn you Galvin', like she is talking to a super villain. There are a handful of side characters that exist for similar emotional ploys or to update us on anymore endangered school children. Through his structural and aesthetic techniques, Scott shows very little faith in his audience. In the end climax he persists in cutting back and forth to the families watching and cheering the two heroes like he's giving an emotional cue to the audience. His monotonous hyper-kinetic direction, including helicopter shots and computer maps, does little to enhance the drama of characters we don't really care about. Having Washington immobilised is also problematic because it means he can't be physically involved with the action for a very long time. Thankfully, he's still a naturally charismatic force. He and Pine do well to wade through some dry procedural dialogue. Even with a sketchy role, Dawson's efforts cannot be faulted either. The film might be enough to satisfy the sugar rush of unchallenging entertainment but who really wants to spend any more time on a train than they have to?",Unstoppable

104,griffolyon12,An Unstoppable Thrill Ride!,9,14 November 2010,"What do you do when a train carrying hazardous materials mistakenly rockets out of the train yard towards a highly populated area where it is sure to derail at its speed? Call in Denzel Washington and Captain Kirk, a.k.a. actor Chris Pine. That is the movie Unstoppable, a story inspired by true events.We watch as actor Ethan Suplee gets inside train 777 simply to move it, but when he jumps out of the cab to switch tracks, the throttle shifts out of position and the train rockets out of the train yard at 70 mph. Much of the first half of the movie follows the train's progress, rather than our eventual working class heroes, Washington and Pine. Washington plays a veteran train engineer who has been fired to make room for the new, younger guys like Pine, and he only has three weeks left at the railroad company. Director Tony Scott really plays with this dynamic in Pine being the conductor above Washington on the train in which they just happen to be driving towards number 777. This is a very current issue that is being seen right now, and it's nice to see the incompetence of the young upstarts and the skill and knowledge of the vets, letting us know that these old dogs have still got some bite left in 'em and we shouldn't write 'em off. Of course, our heroes eventually decide to chase down the train and stop it from derailing, and it it here that it is most apparent that this is a movie all about the journey and entertainment, so I wasn't prepared for the emotional heft of the second half of the story.In the first half, Washington and Pine's screen time is minimal, and very little character development occurs other than what we see from their first meeting, young gun meeting vet, but once they decide to chase down the train, their relationship grows and we actually get an emotional component to this story. Director Tony Scott takes a very minimalist approach to this movie, he only follows train 777 and its progress, and we don't really follow our heroes till they're in the cross-hairs of the train. In some ways I would have liked to have seen more character development in the first 45 minutes between Washington and Pine, but then that would have stopped this unstoppable story and would have lost much of the story's intensity. This is a thrill ride through and through; while it is formulaic, it is also entertaining and emotionally rewarding.I give Unstoppable a 9 out of 10!",Unstoppable
105,Min111,The movie is stoppable,2,1 November 2014,"Unstoppable was a dull movie. Apparently, it is a action-thriller film, but it hardly has much action, and certainly didn't thrill me. Yes, there are some scenes that are very good, but overall, the film disappoints.The film is basically about a runaway Train that is carrying a load of toxic chemicals that if not stopped, has the capability of destroying a town. Its up to an Engineer (Denzel Washington) and his Conductor (Chris Pine) to stop the train, and prevent this serious disaster.Unstoppable was just too predictable and unexciting. The plot of the film is a joke and just unrealistic. The movie just doesn't thrill you I'm afraid.In the film, it seemed to me the media knows more about the situation of the train rather than the people who operate it and are in charge of the trains.What's also disappointing is that they show the live coverage of the dangerous situation on television. The helicopter following the train was annoying, as it was hard to understand the dialogue.The acting was poor and the cast over did it. The script and dialogue of this movie was uninteresting. The action this film does have is nothing to be amazed about. The action to put it felt like child's play at times.So those who haven't seen this film yet, but maybe planning to see it, my advise to you would be to not bother wasting your time.

He lacks both of those two's charisma and acting chops, but to be fair, he doesn't have much to work with here.Rosario Dawson is actually quite believable as the train moderator or whatever you call her. She does seem like an authority figure to be reckoned with. And my favorite Kevin Dunn, both sleazy and endearing at the same time.

107,doctorsmoothlove,Unstoppable,6,31 December 2010,"Last year, director Tony Scott managed to do the highly improbable when he made a good modern train movie in his version of The Taking of Pelham 123. Now he has brought audiences back under his locomotive breadth with an original film, Unstoppable. Scott isn't as creative as his older brother Ridley, but his films are, and have been, consistently entertaining. His newest one is an intelligently crafted genre picture that places itself neatly within appealing to general audiences and more demanding cineastes.Scott removes the human element from Pelham and replaces it with savage indifference in Unstoppable. This isn't a movie about someone taking over a functional train and holding people hostage. Instead, the train is unleashed onto the track with no one conducting. It is loaded with flammable chemicals and will pass through many populated areas. At one of these places is a steep curve that will inevitably cause the train to topple. Should it be derailed and destroyed, or can it be stopped? The train continues out of control for most of the picture after a company-lead attempt to stop it fails. Two rail workers, Frank Barnes (Denzel Washington) and Will Colson (Chris Pine) determine that if they are able attach their single cart to the runaway, they may be able to gradually slow it down. They have only a limited amount of time before the deadly curve appears, so they act quickly. What would seem like an ordinary ending doesn't come to be. They survive the curve.Scott's movie teases other, lesser ones by setting up and ignoring situations like that. The deadly train is at one point on course to crash into a train full of schoolchildren, but it misses them. The movie is a confrontation between person and machine and isn't bogged down by a need to end in a certain way. As an audience, we want the heroes to prevail, which they do, but we don't care how they do it. The train is more ferocious and the heroes more endearing since each are able to embrace their narrative purposes to the fullest.The action sequences in Unstoppable are visceral and harrowing. The camera follows Frank or Will as they maneuver on top of the train from a distance to maximize the terror of their situation. They are moving in excess of 70 miles-per-hour, and we are constantly reminded of their speed. A number of external shots are observed from the point of view of the audiences watching live coverage of the train. This too creates urgency but compromises the film's raw emotional backbone.Scott's movie doesn't believe enough in its main characters. What the two of them are doing is heroic, and anyone should be able to recognize that. Instead, Frank and Will's families have plenty of screen time to be worried. Shots of them are inserted at regular intervals once the action picks up. They also try to serve as character development, as if that were important in a film about an escaped train. They don't detract from the movie, as it is good enough to cover them, but they prevent it from being more than a great rental.Recommended",Unstoppable
108,statuskuo,Technical Achievement Buries Union Story,7,2 February 2021,"There is a lot to unpack about ""Unstoppable."" With the glossy punk rock beauty of Tony Scott's style, this mundane chug-a-long train flick is amped to an adrenaline induced action flick that has helicopters in practically every shot.
Okay, here's what you have to get past...the absolutely ridiculous (yet somehow true) idea that a runaway train can run amok (it can, it did). IF you can lay that idea to rest, trust me the rest is fun.
Grateful am I for the non-stop pacing of information coming at me from the rat-a-tat style that could only come from train experts. Somehow actors Kevin Corrigan, Kevin Dunn and specifically Rosario Dawson make it VERY clear what is going on and what it is capable of. Yes, they could've made it intolerably exposited, but instead director Scott puts these words in the mouths of everyone who would be an expert.
Now we learn a few things about train unions, contracts, and even relationships in the rust belt. All which, if you've worked in an industrial plant, you get the constant reminder of the hierarchy of power. And also how older established workers are muscled out for younger cheaper labor. Although, it is laughable this would be resolved in a day, the action makes us forget we are watching a ""Norma Rae"" union level storyline.
But I digress, trains crashing and music video cutting seems to be at its last legs with this film (Michael Bay is still wearing his old suits). I truly miss the style of Tony Scott when it comes to having this punk rock sensibility but STILL being able to shoehorn a TON of ideas.",Unstoppable
109,PIST-OFF,Rare blue collar movie hits it out of the park,9,12 May 2021,"Tony Scott takes on a blue collar movie that is note perfect. Filled with technical jargon and not afraid to trust the audience's intelligence. Movies like this are rare nowadays. A movie that brings it down to earth with normal people. Fast paced, well acted, well written. A damn good overlooked movie. Highly recommended.",Unstoppable
110,davidgee,"""Airport"" express",7,10 December 2010,"What a treat - and a relief - to see a disaster movie that relies on stunts rather than CGI. The runaway train theme is far from new, but the pace and racked-up tension in Tony Scott's film injected freshness into the cliché. Denzel Washington and Chris Pine have back stories that flesh them out without slowing the plot down. This reminded me of A PERFECT STORM where you got under the skin of those sailors before the big wave (a forgivable use of CGI) hit them. Contrast with EARTHQUAKE which had stunning stunts (I've avoided saying ""cunning stunts""! - no I haven't) but the soap-opera element to the characters made you long for the aftershocks to drop rubble on some of them.UNSTOPPABLE also reminded me more than a bit of the AIRPORT series. It was ever-so-slightly clunky and almost old-fashioned in the way it constantly threatened calamity but took the time to make it seem that real people were facing real choices in the face of a disaster that might really happen to any of us if we live near a railway.Let's have more of these, please, and (a lot) less of TRANSFORMERS. Perhaps it's time to re-make TOWERING INFERNO, the Daddy of all disaster movies.",Unstoppable

How can a movie about a runaway train work? Well, I was wrong. I really liked this movie! Denzel Washington is his usual masterful self, and nails this role completely! And Chris Pine and Rosario Dawson also give dang good performances! I also liked the humor, like -""Connie: How's Will?Frank: He's, ah... He's different. Over.""

115,kgprophet,Potential for a Great Movie reduced to Crayon Cartoon,4,12 November 2010,"There seemed to be a potential for a good action thriller here such as ""Speed"", and seemed to be off to a good start. The first act of this film smartly eases into the dilemma, but uses every cliché in the book to pad out the story. I am sure that this Tony Scott product depicts the story ""inspired by true events"" down to the last detail (to laugh). It is not even 5 minutes into the movie and a bunch of school children are tossed in front of the runaway train. Both lead actors Denzel Washington and Chris Pine are given little to work with. Denzel is a by-the-book train engineer, Pine is a rookie learning the ropes. Their family side stories are fleeting and lack any gravitas. Cue the tracking shots. My god the tracking shots. Tony, please, by making your tracking shots faster and more frequent, you don't automatically make your movie any better. Literally every line of dialogue seems to be a tracking shot. The same tracking shot of Chris Pine's close-up. Again and again and again. I had to look away. I was getting nauseous like I do from the ""Paul Greengrass"" effect.Contrary to the the line in the opening credits, the screenplay feels uninspired. There are ham-handed digs at corporate insensitivity. TV reporters are continuously providing spoon-fed exposition in a way that would insult six-year-olds. And just in case you don't a get enough of the ""Fox News"" graphics in the corner of every TV report, there is a blatant full blown FOX NEWS ADVERTISEMENT thrown in. And geez, what's with the constant helicopter action shots? Do you have to throw two news helicopters in EVERY SINGLE CUT? Every single angle? Every close-up, medium, wide? Please please please have someone like your brother tell you about the value of LESS IS MORE. In other words, you will care more about the characters if you don't put them in cartoonish moments of conflict.Minor Spoilers ahead...A train being driven by Denzel and Pine must move to a side track to get out of the way of the oncoming runaway train. The runaway roars down the main track and slams into the other train with about 10 cars still on the main track. By all logic, the 10 cars going the opposite direction should stop or at least derail the runaway train, but the runaway seems to only smash through a single railroad car and go along unimpeded. One ridiculous threat of danger is the ""Stanton Turn"", an obvious bit of CGI where big obvious fuel storage tanks are neatly lined along the most dangerous point of the curve. With no safety embankments or anything. But of course, Tony Scott has to push it to another laughable extreme where the entire town of people (wait - weren't they supposed to be evacuated?), emergency vehicles, and a slew of reporters are STANDING DIRECTLY BELOW THE DANGEROUS CURVE. Come on, you stop feeling a sense of danger when you turn it into a Road Runner cartoon.Minor Spoilers finished...A much better film is ""Runaway Train"" with Jon Voigt and Eric Roberts. Voigt gives a performance of a lifetime, and Andrey Konchalovsky creates a far more powerful sense of danger and excitement. And please don't fall for the ""inspired by real events"". Although the basic elements of the story were based on a real incident in Ohio in 2001, the train never reached 70mph, and there never was a dead man's curve. Like the awful ""Taking of Pelham One. Two, Three"", Scott makes the mistake of remaking a film without improving it. This makes it no better than a TV movie (in fact ""Taking of Pelham"" was previously a TV movie). I laughed out loud when a seriously infantile piece of animation depicted the imminent disaster (again for those born without a brain) in ""Unstoppable"" just a few moments before the big climax. Perhaps one could defend this approach to filmmaking as being a roller coaster ride, not serious cinema. I would disagree, because you still get thrill of danger on a real roller coaster. This movie is the kiddie merry-go-round.",Unstoppable
116,jtncsmistad,"Denzel Washington delivers yet again in ""Unstoppable"".",6,4 February 2017,"Denzel Washington time and time again elevates the caliber of any film he touches. To employ the vernacular, ""The guy really classes up the joint"". His portrayal of Frank, a no-bullsh-- veteran Train Engineer in 2010's ""Unstoppable"", only serves to perpetuate this career-spanning capacity.Washington is equal parts compelling and believable in this ""based on actual events"" story as an ordinary man thrust headlong into extraordinarily volatile circumstances as he struggles to stop a runaway and pilotless train of tankers filled with explosively flammable cargo. Frank is somewhat jaded and cynical, yes, and with fair reason in light of the unseemly politics and the for-crap management he has wrestled with over his decades of rock solid service. It is consistently captivating to witness this fellow grapple with both the enormously stressful situation at hand and the incompetents who inhabit positions of leadership at his Railway Freight company. Chris Pine is just fine as the new kid Engineer, Will, working his first day on the job with Frank. However, for my money it isn't anywhere near the authentically impressive performance he generates in the Oscar-nominated movie of last year ""Hell or High Water"". In that role Pine is REALLY good, clearly far more mature and evolved as an actor. Here he merely more or less occupies a run-of-the-mill stock function.And props are due Rosario Dawson, as well, who is staggeringly beautiful as always in a helluva turn as a tough-a-- chick who bucks authority to do what is right rather than what most satisfies the corporate bottom line. Dawson's character of Connie is strong, smart, savvy and, again, aesthetically stunning.""Unstoppable"" is a notch or two above your standard Popcorn Thrill Ride flick. But it almost certainly would not have been even this good were it not for the inimitable contributions of the wondrous Washington. Movies are great.",Unstoppable
117,dvc5159,"A simple, solid, and very intense thrill ride from start to finish.",8,5 November 2010,"It would not be much for me to say that above, having Denzel Washington re- teaming up with his frequent collaborator, director Tony Scott, on yet another movie involving a train very soon after last year's ""Pelham 123"". Comparisons, no matter how many people try to avoid it, is futile. One is always going to end up better than the other.Fortunately, ""Unstoppable"" is better than ""Pelham 1 2 3"". The main reason is that while ""Pelham"" works as more of a crime thriller, ""Unstoppable"" like the title suggests, is an action film. It has exhilarating action sequences laced with heart-stopping suspense and white-knuckle thrills the moment that train is let loose. It is cliché to say it, but it's terrific edge-of-your-seat entertainment. For those who are short on thrills after bland after-summer borefests (here's looking at you, ""Takers""), this movie is for you.Is it going to win any Oscars? With a movie like this? No, of course not. This isn't ""There Will Be Blood"". It's not exactly intelligent, but it is mostly believable. Inspired by true story, writer Mark Bomback's (""Live Free or Die Hard"") script is fueled on one simple, very basic premise - a runaway train of doom (complete with highly toxic and explosive material packed in the last of its carriages). There are no human villains, just human heroics, stupidity and carelessness, plus a speeding and out of control giant bullet that can cause certain doom for many people. Those human qualities are what gives this film a realistic and believable edge.The heroes are just everyday guys like you and me - Denzel Washington especially proves himself adaptable to every role assigned to him; in fact you can say that Washington plays himself in many his films, with that friendly smile and gentleman-like charm. He is tense, and worried when the role requires him to, and you feel for him and root for his character all the way.But Washington is not alone in trying to stop this missile-on-wheels. Chris Pine here shows star power, and he has many heroic moments. I'm not saying that all looks, no substance. The guy shows, like Denzel, emotions when he needs to. The chemistry between him and Denzel is great, the buddy moments were there as well.Both of them are the two main characters, but others are busy trying to stop this giant behemoth (most to useless effects). Rosario Dawson, Kevin Dunn and Lew Temple all give solid supporting performances as they try to stop the train at all costs.Yes, the script could use some reworking, especially in the cliché- filled dramatic parts, but Mark Bomback's script is ultimately an extended chase sequence that doesn't relent the moment it starts. The aforementioned dramatic moments take place during the action, so the film's pace is about as tight as a bullet. It's short, simple (we're talking bare-bones simple here, don't expect any hidden meanings to be unfurled like the vastly superior ""Runaway Train"" by Andrei Konchalovsky), and straight to the point. And perhaps that is why ""Unstoppable"" works - it has a very nice touch of simplicity, with an easy to understand plot and like-able, everyday guys who have no choice but to save the day before pandemonium breaks out.Technical wise, it is outstanding. All of the films action sequences are filmed with REAL trains and REAL destruction and mayhem, making it perfect eye candy for action junkies drained of an adrenaline rush. Twisted metal and explosions are (almost) always a joy to watch, ESPECIALLY if they are real - but in this film some may cringe with the action sequences, knowing that it may destroy a town - the danger is there. Not a tinge of CGI (perhaps only the sparks?) is seen throughout the film. The production design - the setting of the film which takes place in rural Pennsylvania, is calm, serene and kind of homely (most of the film is set outdoors, for obvious reasons). The cinematography, thankfully, is bright, lively, and crisp - thus allowing the audience to see the scenery as well as the action sequences in all their glory - the shaky-cam is sparingly used, and even so, you can still see what's going on as the shaky-cam is used from a distance. The editing is also very fluid, Chris Lebenzon has definitely learned and improved from his dizzying and messy hatchet job on ""Pelham"", but this is also due to the intervening of other editor Robert Duffy, a frequent collaborator of avant-garde filmmaker Tarsem Singh. Frequent Scott collaborator Harry Gregson-Williams also composes a tense, if not unoriginal, orchestral score that gives tension to scenes when it needs it.Last but not least, director Tony Scott himself. Here is a man who knows how to make an action film. Having made many action films for nearly three decades, age has certainly done nothing to slow his signature style down. The direction is kinetic and focused, and Scott delivers the action goods in spades. I think, due to the friendship and frequent collaboration with Denzel Washington (this film marks their fifth collaboration overall) that Scott continues to be an in-demand action film director, and this film contributes to that winning streak. If it ain't broke, don't fix it.Take this - anybody can describe the film's plot in just two words: runaway train. If people want to see a movie about a runaway train, they certainly got it in the form of this film. It's what they pay for. See it with friends, especially in a big theater hall with a nice sound system. Glad to see a movie that works entirely without flashy CGI and 3D visuals, and still manages to be a terrificly entertaining crowd- pleaser.Overall rating: 70/100 (Good)Edit: R.I.P. Tony. Such a shocking end to a marvelously kinetic career. You and your films will be missed. Condolences to Ridley and the Scott family.",Unstoppable
118,gary-444,An Action Classic,8,16 November 2010,"Anyone looking for cerebral entertainment should avoid this film. But if you like the action/disaster genre this is top drawer fare. It is a classic in that it draws upon staple ingredients, you know exactly what you are going to get, and there are no surprises, but it still entertains because all the ingredients work so well.The plot is very simple, a crew less, passenger less freight train leaves a depot through human error and careers towards the conurbation of Stanford with an explosive cargo on board. Fortunately an old lag of a train driver ,in Denzel Washington ( a black modern day Casey Jones) ,and the greenhorn, Chris Pine, are on hand to save the day.Director Tony Scott does not mess around, the runaway freight train is the star of the show, appears early, and a few minor sub-plots exist purely to allow us to catch our breath. Of course children and animals are put in jeopardy, of course helicopters buzz, police cars crash and a shoot out (of sorts) is even squeezed in. You want heroics as the stars walk across the top of a train travelling at speed? You get it! There are some good one-liners, Corporate Greed is trounced and the humble working man triumphs, what more do you need?With no bad language, and a tight 98 minute running time, this really is vintage entertainment to simply enjoy- not think about.

119,bluesman-20,Unstoppable force meets two immovable objects.,10,31 December 2010,Unstoppable is a great action film that gets you at the edge of your seat. the acting is superb and the pace of the film is relentless. It builds up the suspense and executes it with a nice mix of style and flair for the dramatic. The Story is this. A careless driver and his conductor are assigned a train carrying deadly chemicals the conductor notices the air brakes are not connected but the driver is in a hurry to get going brushes it off saying they won't need them. As the Train gets rolling the driver notices he's on a wrong track leaving the yard so he sets the train to independent and he sets the brakes but does not lock the brakes. With the train rolling at a slow pace he jumps out despite the objections of the train yard switches the track and then to his horror sees the train pick up speed. the brakes are not locked and the train begins to move faster then he thought and he can't catch up to board it. when the train yard and the train company are advised of the fact that the train is under power and rolling with no driver and carrying toxic chemicals. Panic hits the fan. The company from the dispatcher to the President are trying to corner the disaster when it becomes apparent the train is picking up speed and heading towards a well populated area. Then they are informed that if the train crashes in the city they are looking at the disaster of the century and that if those chemicals explode will wipe out a entire city and the surrounding areas. As attempt after attempt to stop it fails it soon comes down to two men One is Veteran Driver Frank Barnes a driver of 28 years Barnes knows his job backwards and forwards along with Barnes his his newly trained Conducter Will Colson. Colson is headstrong and aware of how his union connections got him a job in a company laying off men. Not liked because of his name he must prove himself. Barnes and Colson don't like each other much or trust each other too much until they realize that the only men who can stop the runaway is them and their battered engine. The men team together to stop the train before it reaches the city because they have family there. THe Acting of denzel Washington is smooth and he comes across as a expert in this type of film the real surprise is Chris Pine fresh from his success in Star Trek Pine proves that Trek was not a fluke and that he can act. The film is watchable ad carries itself with a nice style that leaves you thinking about it long after you leave the theatre.,Unstoppable

121,rollernerd,All aboard!,7,19 April 2021,"Welcome to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue in intro music**All aboard movie goers!! Another train related movie?? Whattttt!!??!! Today's movie review is the runaway-train logistical rollercoaster Unstoppable (2010) starring my man Denzel Washington as a veteran engineer who may be training a rookie newcomer for the last time. The trainee rookie is Chris Pine. So pretty much both men have issues with one another. Both play your average everyday men with real concerns over livelihood and family. Soon the two must put aside their differences when they find out they must stop a runaway locomotive carrying loads of dangerous chemicals which is headed into a blue collared hometown.Now firstly, I had no expectation of this film especially finding the title lame and generic but mannnn was it entertaining. I was on edge which may be due to the directorship of Tony Scott's visuals and explaining the chaos from different perspectives including both leading men who must figure out how to catch up to the rogue engine, and stop it before harm comes to the town, while also looking at the perspective of yard master Connie played by Rosario Dawson who is on the radio talking them through their various attempts to stop the ""Beast.""Simple story, with both actors playing rundown regular average type Joe's saving the day. Enjoyed the buddy chemistry between the moody Denzel who delivers a low-key but impressive performance and Pine who is at the start the hothead and the new gen at the railyard but learns to put aside their differences so he can save his loved ones. Filmed with dramatic angles, Scott's adrenaline shots pretty much grabbed me from the get-go and didn't let go until the very end. Yes its abit clichéd where ordinary men who do extraordinary acts of courage in the face of danger - but I actually didn't mind it. The film has many high-octane action sequences however delves in realism with catching the high-speed train which does give it an exciting feel. Overall 7.8/10 - go watch it.",Unstoppable

The lives of dozens, perhaps hundreds of people were at stake as the train was heading at full speed for a densely populated town. And the pair of common railway workers that rose to the challenge of stopping that train, becoming real life heroes.The movie is well executed, a bit predictable as it fits the standards of modern Hollywood movies, which all look the same in many ways, witch weakens the overall experience.

123,Ryan_MYeah,"Speedy, and enjoyable, albeit unmemorable.",6,19 November 2010,"Unstoppable, Tony Scott's second action thriller starring Denzel Washington as a man trying to save many lives from a corrupted train in a long and convoluted race against time, stylized by kinetic film editing, the first of which being last year's The Taking of Pelham 123. Despite two of these movies feeling like overkill, I will say Unstoppable is a better movie. That's not saying it's a good movie, though, because (Aside from Washington and Travolta playing off of each other perfectly) I really couldn't stand Pelham 123. If nothing else, Unstoppable is an enjoyable, and alacritous popcorn flick, even if highly forgettable.Denzel Washington plays Frank Barnes, a veteran train engineer who is three weeks away from forced retirement, and Chris Pine plays Will Colson, the conductor who will soon replace him. The two don't get along at the start (As don't most in films of this stature), but must put their differences aside when, with the help of a train yardmaster (Played by Rosario Dawson), must stop a runaway train, described as a ""Missile the size of the Chrysler Building"", that is briskly barreling towards a large town, and threatens to blow everything that stands in its way to kingdom come.The premise is inspired by real events that happened in Ohio in 2001, but exaggerated for dramatic effect. It could make a great film, but Mark Bomback (The man behind films like Live Free or Die Hard and Race to With Mountain) can't keep a narrative focus at all times, and doesn't give enough of the characters proper development. While I do give credit for Washington and Pine doing their best to hold it all together, it's still bogged down by other elements. Dawson is just fine in her screen time, and then there's Kevin Dunn as (Surprise, surprise) the arrogant boss who doesn't think the plan by these two will work.Still, the action helps this movie out largely, it's well staged, and I admire how Tony Scott does not want to rely heavily on CGI, and keeps things as real as possible (A decision that's much to the film's benefit). His jumpy, and kinetic editing is put to good use, though at times it's too showy. Then there's the highly involving sound mix, which really puts you in the middle of it all. Not all the techs are great though, such as Ben Seresin's cinematography which is very choppy, and confusing, as is Harry Gregson-Williams' score, which hops around from subtle piano motifs, to loud electronics. I also thought the second act was a little draggy.Still, I'm willing to be magnanimous enough to give Unstoppable **1/2 out of ****",Unstoppable
124,nicolechan916,Exciting,8,30 June 2016,"Though this film has a pretty simple and straightforward story, it is still exciting to watch. It does well in establishing the normality of the lives of these railway workers and the rhythm that they work in. Scott does well in setting the tone of the film early on, and with the music accompaniment, the tension slowly rises. Pine and Washington are good in their roles, and work well together. Perhaps it is because their characters do not get along well, which may be easier to portray. Anyway, their delivery and chemistry with each other fit the film. Dawson does well in roles with a sense of urgency to them. I vaguely remember her being an FBI agent somewhere else, and with this character, she is able to portray how intense a situation they're in. I especially liked the cinematography and editing in this movie. With a high speed train moving through various landscapes, the numerous wide angle and aerial shots give a good view of the surroundings. The quick jump cuts, and juxtapositions between the various characters on screen also helps to keep the audience well informed.One thing that I felt was a bit forced, was the family angle. I guess being characters, the filmmakers felt that they needed to incorporate family values, so put that in there. I didn't care much for the drama of Pine's life though. I was intrigued a little at what may have happened, but Pine's character didn't really fit the drama. Overall, quite an exciting but simple film.",Unstoppable
125,williampsamuel,Unstoppable is Non-Stop Fun,8,11 April 2019,"There's been talk for some time now that the disaster film is dead as a genre, and given the entries in the last few years, it's been hard to argue that. We've seen the somewhat depressing Poseidon, the overwrought and overly politicized The Day After Tomorrow, and an attempted spoof, Disaster Movie, widely considered to be the worst comedy in a generation, if not ever.But now, with the release of Unstoppable, it would appear that reports of the disaster film's demise were greatly exaggerated. Unstoppable is a taut, fast paced thriller that builds the excitement right to the very end.As in all disaster films, things start to go very wrong, very early. Through a series of human errors compounded by bad luck and misinformation, a freight train with eight carloads of toxic chemicals, no brakes, and no-one on board is sent barreling down the tracks at full speed. Its starting point is only a hundred miles from certain derailment in the middle of a major city, and there are a lot of things that could go wrong before then.Blissfully unaware of what's unfolding are rookie conductor Will Colton (Matt Damon) and veteran engineer Frank Barnes (Denzel Washington). As attempts to halt the runaway train fail, the pair find themselves on collision course. But if they can avoid hitting it head on, they just might have the best chance to bring it under control.
Before the big crisis at the end, there are of course several smaller emergencies that must be dealt with. Instinctively we know that the train isn't going to wreck or be brought to a halt before it reaches the big city: that wouldn't give the movie enough running time. But each incident further demonstrates the sheer power of the train, and excitement is generated from seeing how the characters work through these problems. And the movie never asks us to believe that everything's ok, problem solved; only that our heroes have bought themselves more time. Their still screwed, just not as much as before.
Another strong point is the use of newscasts to keep us, and the supporting characters informed. In most of these segments, rather than having us look over the shoulder of someone who's watching it on TV, the newscast is shown directly to the audience, heightening the sense that we're watchingIt also helps that Will and Frank are given believable attributes and personal issues. Will is the new guy; he's had the training, but not the experience. Frank, for his part, seems to feel threatened by these new hires, eager to take the jobs he's been working for decades. Will's rookie blunders don't do anything to endear him to Frank either, and some of them will have real consequences on down the line. Both men also have issues with their families, who live directly in the train's path. None of this felt like an attempt to create extra drama. Instead it helped us in the audience to sympathize with, and root for the two men.The thing that strikes me most about Unstoppable is that this isn't some far off event, like a freak wave hitting a cruise ship, or a massive earthquake ripping California in half. The disaster here involves something most of us interact with on a daily basis, and is brought on by a series of easily made errors. This is the kind of thing you could imagine happening in real life.Watching this movie at the local megaplex, I heard gasps and saw clenched jaws when things were tight, and there were sighs of relief at the end. The audience, myself included, really got into this one. While the things that happen in this movie are disastrous, spending five bucks to see it at your nearest theatre won't be.",Unstoppable

127,Jerique,Denzel Overshadowed?,7,10 March 2011,"I've seen many of Denzel's movies. I've never seen one that I didn't like. Throughout the entire film of Unstoppable, I was rooting for Denzel...but this wasn't his movie. Tony Scott does a good job of deploying his great directing techniques for the action sequences in the middle acts of the movie, onward. However, it takes a little too long for the premise to be set up.I was terrified for Denzel and Chris Pine throughout the movie, and without these two guys attached, I probably wouldn't have bothered. Rosario Dawson supports the leads in their gutsy call to rundown an unman train that travels through Pennsylvania going 70 miles per hour.Denzel plays a widow named Frank Barnes, and he has the task of training Will Colson, played by Chris Pine. This movie is Chris Pine's moment for shining. I literally said out loud near the end of the film that Denzy is passing the torch. Denzel has been the hero countless times and it seems he gave up the role of hero this time around to the younger crowd of Pine. Chris carries the burden throughout the movie as the rookie young guy where the veteran Denzel is wiser than everyone else in the movie. Denzel's veteran acting over Pine's allowed for me to believe that Pine could become the hero instead of Denzel.I felt that as soon as Pine says his line, as heard from the trailer, ""we're gonna run this b**ch down,"" that the movie rested upon his shoulders. Denzel takes the lead for a moment, but it overtaken by Pine in the end.Unstoppable is not one of top ten films of 2010, but it's clearly in the top twenty. I enjoyed the cinematography, and the visual effects. I liked how it was all completely new. It was great to see Denzel in a variation of his usual role. I also liked seeing Rosario Dawson in the film in a new kind of role for her. She really shined in this one, I think.It's an exaggeration of true events that happened many years ago, and although it kind of feels like Speed (a favourite of mine) I think the movie feels a bit dragged at times. It was merely 90 minutes, yet it felt like two hours. It might have had something to do with editing, but my guess is the pacing and action makes it feel longer. It might have to do with eagerness of the viewer to get to the anticipation of the result of ""what happened?"" It was a good movie, and I liked it very much. I don't see how anyone would hate this movie, considering it's for entertainment...not for accuracy of true events. It's just for thrills.",Unstoppable
128,Rindiana,Runaway Train,5,30 November 2010,"With no real villain in sight and with its blue collar down-to-earth approach, this unusually (though just relatively) subdued Tony Scott railway actioner proves to be surprisingly watchable.This pic's lean clean disaster fodder without much of the usual clichéd stereotyping, thereby providing an uncommon focus on plain technical aspects, avoiding the pitfalls of unbelievable melodramatics, though some trivial rudimentary emotional background on the protagonists is still at hand.That said, the pic doesn't leave much of a lasting impression, despite its immediate impact.5 out of 10 dangerous curves",Unstoppable
129,gabriel_sanchez,It delivers...,8,12 December 2015,"I think I can't say more about this movie above what has being said already. Unstoppable (2010) is a very straightforward action movie. There's not too much to it besides some good old fashion action.You know what's going to be when things start to take its place. Like I said, there isn't too much to it indeed: we have a eminent catastrophe that is about to happen and two guys, a veteran and a rookie, that happens to be badass enough to become heroes.It's simple and it's good! Though you know what's going to happen, you can't just walk away from it. You get drawn onto it. It grows on you.Don't get me wrong, though. I'm not saying this movie is great.

130,digdog-785-717538,"very enjoyable, masterfully done",8,9 January 2015,"I'm a sucker for realism.For years, i loved films in their genre which make magic out of the habits of professionals; the magic of film is, after all, to make the ordinary appear extraordinary, and while in Unstoppable, railroading (the various jobs relating to the train and railroad industry)is by no means science fiction, their lingo, habits, actions are unknown to the general populace, and here they are masterfully exploited to create suspense and amazement.Unstoppable is the story of a railroad train that, through human error and bad luck, becomes a runaway, speeding down the track without a conductor, while carrying a heavy load of dangerous chemicals. Denzel Washington is a (different) train driver that, due to circumstances, finds himself in a fight to stop the runaway.Now, what i find really amazing is that, while Denzel is in full form (he always is, but sometimes he's criminally misused - see The Equalizer), the film is not centered around his character, but rather around the story. One might say that Denzel isn't even playing a character here, but due to seer charisma and acting prowess, he excels nonetheless.Supporting characters are very good, and most importantly, near-perfectly framed in the story; everything works, everything fits, this film is great.Now, normally i reserve the highest votes for film which make a statement, which are unique, not simple entertainment; but as an exception, since this film is so well done, i will grant Unstoppable My vote of: 8/10 - exceptionally entertaining and superbly well made.",Unstoppable
131,Michael Fargo,All aboard (save the screenplay writers),7,13 November 2010,"There's some great work here (in descending order) by cinematographer Ben Seresin who creates a some stunning sequences of (guess what?) trains moving across the landscape and keeps the camera flying even in stationary settings. His work is enhanced by editors Robert Duffy and Chris Lebenzon who generally keep the complex visuals (all trains kinda look alike) sorted out and suspenseful. Tony Scott conducts all of this with efficiency of purpose, although some of his choices (Hooters comes to mind) distract us from the plot. At the bottom of a strong technical effort is the screenplay. Just about any of the dialog stops...the train. I like action films and it's nice to see one that's not tied to extraterrestials or gunfire. The weight of the machinery here is welcome and would have been difficult to recreate with CGI. The performances are handicapped by the screenplay, particularly Rosario Dawson (a favorite) is left stranded in a room biting her nails for the entire length of the film. This would have been a better summer release since it's going to be quickly forgotten in the award season entries about to come out. I would, however, recommend seeing it on the big screen with Dolby sound, since at home, even with a Home Theater system, the slim screenplay will seem even more...thin.",Unstoppable
132,ssvikas,The typical Hollywood action staple!,6,30 November 2010,"Coming from director Tony Scott whose work amazed us in 'Top Gun', 'Unstoppable' marks his second film following 'Taking of Pelham 123' to feature trains that also starred Denzel Washington. While Washington got busy battling a devious market manipulator played by John Travolta in the earlier flick shot on New York metro, Unstoppable pits him against 777, an unmanned runaway train in Pennsylvania. Frank Barnes (Washington) is an old railway engineer on his way out on compulsory retirement is paired up with a newbie conductor Will Colson played by Chris Pine, last seen in the latest Star Trek rehash of 2009. Despite getting off a rough start, the duo has to put aside their differences to stop a speeding train laden with hazardous cargo.The flick is loosely based on a real life incident in Ohio in 2001 where a 47-car CSX train left the yard unmanned and could only be stopped after it clocked 66 miles. For the film, CSX becomes the fictional Allegheny West Virginia Railroad, top speeds cross 70mph as against 47 managed by CSX. While none were injured in the real incident, the film had to have its actors bloodstained! The dangerous elevated curve wasn't there and the filming location doesn't really have precariously placed oil tanks! Obviously, lots of stuff gets thrown in to make it a fast paced action thriller. The story did have a lot of real stuff, like the driver stepping out to adjust a switch, train cars with molten phenol, the portable derailer failing, cops nearly hitting the fuel cap, another train with a veteran and a newbie latching on to slow the train and finally having a staffer to jump on the slower train to take control.While Denzel Washington delivers usual stuff expected of a veteran that he is, Chris Pine takes the cake for having performed all his stunts on his own, a commendable feat. Camera work is well done and when put together by some neat editing the million tons of steel on the run gives the adrenalin rush. Forget the technical mumbo jumbo though on dynamic brakes or reversing traction; it's a plain no-brainer action flick. Although there isn't much that you would expect for a story or a diabolical villain that gets beaten in the end, 'Unstoppable' gives you just as much entertainment as a ride in an amusement park. Though not giving you something for you ponder over for days, it does make a fine entertainer, never mind the many plot holes. If you are looking for a couple of hours of pastime worth your money, be sure to give this a try!",Unstoppable
133,manendra-lodhi,"""Good thing is that it sticks to the subject from the starting.""",7,23 October 2012,"Without going into the details, within 20 minutes you'll know the problem they are facing. There is an unmanned train going with huge speed. And there are two people who plan to stop it through any means. While the story is obviously intriguing, it has been handled nicely. Putting it in a few words, it is a regular American Action Flick having story, characters, substance and all assembled in an interesting and a tight manner. There is not much to be discussed about different aspects of the film. What you will see most is the plans to stop the train and how they are executed. The best part of the film is that it is nicely written and has action which is neither too gory nor has too many stunts from humans. The role of action is basically done by the train. The sound of it moving so fast on the tracks with the sharp cinematography is enough to keep you on edge.PROS: The screen play is good. The film runs only on story. The acting by the cast is average and since there is so much going on in the film with the train, the actors don't have much space to show their emotions. All focus is taken off in one direction because of the high octane soundtrack whenever the train comes into the picture. The life of the two characters is shown properly edited between their works, which kind of brings them somewhat closer to the audience.CONS: The cinematography at most of the times is quick zoom to a character when he is talking or even doing nothing. That seemed to be catching attention all the time. I felt it was used at too many places and started looking inappropriate. Another thing I always hate in most of the American films the way they depict their characters as above average human beings by showing them too cool in any difficult situation. When it was the time of action, the two guys were talking coolly about their previous lives as if they were born to do things like these. Come On, these were normal average people and one of them was even a new recruit. We need some real time portrayal of the characters. May be things like these are done to set the moods simple.MESSAGE: ""There is a hero in everyone."" VERDICT: ""A recommended watch for action freaks.""",Unstoppable
134,kyrat,meh- it's OK,5,27 June 2011,"It was OK, but it loses -1 star for product placement. -1 star for the product to be a sexist & offensive product and the gratuitous scenes featuring it were nothing more than ads.Otherwise, it's about as exciting as you might think a tale of a ""runaway"" train carrying chemicals speeding towards town can be.I admit it, I watched it because Denzel Washington was in it, and because I've liked some of Tony Scott's other work - but I'm not a huge fan of the disaster genre.Characters are pretty lightly developed - older experienced guy being forced out so company can make money by not paying him full retirement & using lower paid people. Earnest & smart people vs. the greedy corporates who are making decisions based on profit/loss calculations alone. The only mildly interesting character development subplot was the Chris Pine character who started out presented as a possible stalker/abuser.",Unstoppable
135,perkypops,Not the runaway it could have been but still competent - just.,6,5 November 2011,"The underlying story of human errors leading to serial disasters is not as well underscored and used as it could and should have been in a story claimed to be based on fact. Instead we are treated to a finale driven by rather poor CGI, and an in between which doesn't really know where it is going, other than switching tracks as often and as sharply as it could to avoid plot flaws.And so I am left with a largely competent action movie for those with entertainment in mind rather than an intelligent and in depth look at how corporate constructs can be so corrupt. We hardly get to see realistic character development and even when the film tries it does so half-heartedly as if scared it'll get in the way of the fast moving locomotive driving the production. Better to have a largely evacuated township in peril than peer into the heads of those who would rather save their businesses than human lives, or, in the case of the ""goodies"", better to lose their jobs and their lives rather than risk the lives of others. Either way the story fails.So it is a film that does what it says on the tin - it goes from The Beginning to The End without stopping to think about what is in the middle. The acting is passable with Rosario Dawson and Lew Temple in a class of their own and the rest disappointing.I ask a simple question - why didn't you just animate the whole film. It could have been so much more inventive.",Unstoppable
136,colinrgeorge,'Training Day',7,16 November 2010,"With a capable cast and the right script, Tony Scott has made terrific movies. Lately however, he's taken on a string of lousy screenplays and contributed little to them. In ""Unstoppable,"" it isn't initially clear whether he's working for or against us—irksome stylistic choices threaten to derail his momentum at every turn. But like Triple Seven, a ghost train towing a half-mile of hazardous chemicals, the breakneck energy he builds vaporizes any obstructions in its path. ""Unstoppable"" is a fun, effective film.Anchored by charismatic performances by Denzel Washington and Chris Pine, Scott's latest is refreshingly straightforward: a seasoned engineer (Washington) and his trainee (Pine) are on a routine delivery when they unwittingly become the last, best hope to stop an unmanned locomotive from jumping track in a highly populated Pennsylvanian town. Silly though the characters' transitions from blue-collar workers to action stars might be, the premise is simple and stays that way, and the plot builds not in scale but in intensity. Of course, there's plenty of railyard jargon and engineering exposition peppered throughout to create a veneer of complexity, but ""Can't stop the train"" is about all you'll ever need to know.And what more do you need to know? ""Unstoppable"" is one of the most viscerally exciting Hollywood spectacles this year, and a welcome relief in the action spectrum from the ceaseless deluge of military and mercenary films. An action movie sans combat is all but unheard of in this day and age, but never fear; Scott squeezes in enough explosions and speedometer-snapping trucks, helicopters, and trains to keep even the most attention deficient spectators docile. That he does so without relying on conventional violence is just the icing on the cake.Still, ""Unstoppable"" is a far from perfect film, and the fun had comes only after a mandatory adjustment to Scott's ugly shooting style. His carousel dollies, unmotivated snap zooms, and bland color palette are all major distractions. Either Scott doesn't care whether his images have an independent artistry, or he has terrible aesthetic taste. Even his coverage feels inadequate in certain instances—key moments are muddled because we aren't sure of Triple Seven's spatial relationship to its surroundings. For an action director, that's a significant oversight.Yet ultimately, it barely matters. As ugly and unpolished as ""Unstoppable"" often looks, it's hard to deny the base effectiveness of the imagery. The sense of constant motion is no accident, and that the photography manages to vilify Triple Seven as our inanimate antagonist is an accomplishment in itself. The integration of faux newscasts into the narrative is an interesting choice as well, though does little to elevate it on a visual level.""Unstoppable"" is an unambitious action film, but one that succeeds beyond its own meager expectations for itself. It's a goofy, gimmicky movie that will likely play on basic cable years from now, watched and enjoyed by its audience simply ""because it's on."" There is a certain timeless appeal it shares with the likes of Scott's own ""Top Gun,"" and ""Unstoppable"" does for trains what it did for jets.Tony Scott is rarely the sole determiner of his successes, and the stars aligned for ""Unstoppable."" A marriage of performance, material, and realization, the director has hit his first Triple Seven in years. The effectiveness of the equation was audible; even in a half-full screening, the crowd gasped and applauded at all the right moments.If you don't have the opportunity to see this worthwhile thriller theatrically, fear for your evenings when ""Unstoppable"" makes its way to basic cable.",Unstoppable
137,shoobe01-1,"Big, Dumb Action Movie, and nothing else",4,20 January 2014,"Unstoppable is fundamentally a ""railroad procedural."" Like a cop show is a police procedural, involved with the way the job works, so is this one. And like a cop show or movie can fudge the accuracy for dramatic effect, it can never be so far off that we look verisimilitude, or the feeling that it's accurate. That's where this goes all wrong. There is hardly a thing that feels correct during any of the key action sequences or setups. It's a Hollywood action movie, so we forgive the evil corporation, TV news that acts like it's filmed on 70mm, helicopters 10 feet away from all action, sparks and explosions for any reason, and a reasonable number of technical flaws or continuity errors. But we do not live with failures to understand why the action is happening. Movies like this, which sadly means most action movies in the past few decades, seem to think that being invested in the outcome of the action is about caring for the protagonists. Fine. But they do so (badly, as maudlin as possible) to the exclusion of us caring about the outcome of the action itself. Spoiler follows, I guess: Near the end, when they finally board the locomotive, there's nothing extraordinary about the vehicle, the road, the people involved, the time or anything. It's totally unclear why it hasn't happened before this. And thus goes the whole film. Hardly any action feels necessary, except as action which is doomed to fail, periodically fatally, to propel the plot of the film. Which is almost too bad. There's an undercurrent of not awfulness, even from Pine, and even from most of the cartoon-like characters strewn about the film. People here and there tried to make this not terrible. Everyone it seems but those most in charge. Give up and try Runaway Train if you need a movie this bad with locomotives.",Unstoppable
138,thekyles99,Holy intenseness Batman!,10,19 December 2010,"Just when i thought i saw what was left of 2010's best flicks, bang!!! Holy intenseness Batman!!! Now that is what i call a freaking' movie! Although apparently taking loads of liberties from the actual event that occurred at a rail yard on May 15th 2001 in Walbridge, Ohio when after an engineer had jumped off of a moving train to correct a line track switch after mistakingly believing he had properly activated the dynamic breaking system. Which in turn with the train set on 100% full power causes the train to leave the yard full speed ahead, minus any train crew. Denzel Washington portrays Frank Barnes a veteran railroad engineer who's working out his final days on the track he gets partnered along with Will Colson (Chris Pine) who has been on the job only 4 months. They think their day is only routine as they are driving an engine to pick up cars to start their route, a route that might seem boring on normal days however by the end of this one they would be hoping the day stay the way it should've. They find out they are heading head on with a runaway train and its their job to stop it. Yes Hollywood take liberties as I hear the real events were nowhere near as exciting however I'm glad director Tony Scott did. We in turn are treated to one intense, roller-coaster ride that has a terrific cast featuring alongside the main stars, Rosario Dawson, Kevin Dunn,Kevin Chapman who all do a superb job making us feel as intense and out of control as the men did aboard this train!

139,Fields201,Chris Pine has a future ahead,8,15 November 2010,"I really enjoyed Unstoppable. A friend of mine said that, judging from the previews, that it looked like a typical, clichéd movie. He may be right. However, it was still an enjoyable romp even though there's a lot of stupidity going on from other characters in the film in slowly this train down.The film is basically about two guys, played by Denzel and Chris Pine, working together on the railroad. Denzel doesn't like Chris because he knows he's being replaced by a young buck so there's some bitterness there between them. However, after a fat slob lost a runaway train, the two sets out to stop this train despite higher management saying otherwise; and the old cliché of two guys who can't stand each other becomes buddies, well, I guess my friend is right.What makes this film work and not only the fast pace of the directing, but also the performances given by both Denzel and Chris Pine. I really like Denzel in this one. He really proves what a great actor he is because I swear I almost got lost in his character. The writing is top notch too as it's clear that their personal lives isn't perfect. However, their personal lives becomes part of their bond.I only have a couple gripes with the film like whoever was hired as the DP really annoyed me. At times there's this zoom-in effect that really grated on my nerves after a while. There's also some pan around shots of the actors to give it more of an epic feel that gets a little overused.

140,blacklist-1,"Unstoppable is a ""speed"" driven adrenaline ride packed with suspense and gripping tension from beginning to end.",7,30 November 2010,"When it comes to films from Tony Scott, you always know what to expect, sure the script may be formulaic and cliché and there is little if any character development, which makes the characters as interesting as cardboard, but he damn knows how to make an action movie. Unstoppable is no different, basically set as a true story, one engineer, called Frank (Denzel Washington) and a young conductor Will (Chris Pine), who meet on Wills first day of work and at first have a mutual, mild dislike for each other at first until they get caught up in trying to stop a runaway train (that a engineer let go because he left the air brakes on) number 777 from crashing into a populated town called Stanton,which will explode as there are explosive toxins as cargo on board.From a cliché script and little character development Washington and Pine give adequately decent performances with some nice chuckles as their relationship starts from mild dislike and moving onto understanding, trust and finally respect at the end of the movie as they have to work together to stop the runaway train. Also the supporting performance by Rosario Dawson as Connie was good and she deserves to be mentioned. Scott as I say may give little in terms of depth about the character's life, but at least he tries as Frank's two daughters aren't talking to him and Wills wife has put out a restraining order against him and is threatening to take their son away. What does matter with this film is that Scott makes you care about these characters as they don't glamorise them as heroes. He makes an interesting point that they are just two ordinary men who have jobs and want to make their way in the world for the people they love, but commit an extraordinary act of courage and risking their own life's to save hundreds of thousands. Scott stylishly shots this with some jump-cuts and blur outs at the start, like in his remake of The Taking of Pelham 123, but wisely tones it down and sticks to the method of conventional editing and camera work that authenticates the movie by sticking to the gravity of the two ordinary characters who become heroes. There are also some excellent stunts particularly as the film reaches it's climax and the pacing on the film never flags. As I reiterated before this film isn't perfect with an ending that was also predictable and a bit abrupt, but there is no denying this is an entertaining and action packed ride that had suspense and tension from the start to the finish and is enough to satisfy anyone's need for a shot of action pumped adrenaline for the week.",Unstoppable

The movie feeds off clichés , feels at home with a plain and domestic screenplay. There are no twists and turns which may confront even the most gullible viewer.

142,priyantha-bandara,Totally unstoppable,7,6 February 2011,"My score 4/5 If you can actually make an action movie without making the shootings, explosions, fights and stunts so prominent, and still can pull out like a hero then that movie has to be really special. Such movies are seldom or even if it comes out they are boring. BUT 'Unstoppable' proves the unthinkable. It has drama, it has action, and it's one of the best of thrill rides of 2010 no doubt. Its seems like Tony Scott has made a comeback and did something really memorable after his last train flick Phelm 123 ended up being a total wreck even if it had impressive cast. Including Denzel Washington.The story is about a train (777) which is accidentally running at increasing speeds, totally unmanned carrying several carriages of explosive material and heading towards populated areas. The train company pulls off several rescue and stop attempts at 777 but it seems like this monster is no way near of stopping. Mean while a veteran train engineer Frank (Denzel Washington-Inside Man, American Gangster) and 4 months at his job rookie Will (Chris Pine- Star Trek, Smoking Aces) finds out that 777 is heading right towards them in the same track they are running, and there is a slight chance to get out. But Frank decides that when all attempts at stopping 777 fails; he should step in and do something. Taking his 28 years of experience as a knife he and Will cuts to the chase to bring down 777 to a 0mph. The plot unravels in several perspectives. From the point of Frank and Will on the track and mainly from the control room end at the train company. Also it takes us to visit Frank's daughters, Will's wife and the train company head office while groundbreaking decisions are made and corporate nonsense starts to set in. Even while the movie is completely running at thrilling speeds it finds time to build the characters. Make the viewer realize what Frank and Will has back at home and eventually turns the tables to have an emotional ending along with a heroic one. Cinematographically 'Unstoppable' is a bumpy ride. The camera moves, constant speed and thundering sound effects might make you dizzy some times. And the camera keeps jumping from movie cameras to the TV crew cameras (Who cover the event) real time which adds more drama. But that much drama is required to show how tough the ride is and how challenging it is to stop a train half mile long and running at 70mph. There is the job is very well done. Denzel does his part with talent just like he always does to his rolls. It's truly nice to look at his character and the wise old views of life coming out of him. The script may have their technical glitch who knows! I don't know anything about trains or how it runs on those tracks and who controls it. But 'Unstoppable' give you goose bumps over and over and that's good enough thrill for me. 'Unstoppable' is a feast for locomotive lovers and to the everyday action movie lovers the same.

145,jonnyfendi,The Train Goes Faster. The Tension Goes Greater,7,5 December 2010,"Denzel again! Tony Scott again! And train again? The Director Tony Scott must be so curious about thiz train thing. Just last year, Scott urged Denzel Washington into the train robbery for ""The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3"" with John Travolta. Now, he brings up a true event in 2001, when unmanned raging train that carries tons of toxic chemical sliding wildly out of control without air brake and it is totally unstoppable. I have to say, thiz movie is in a very good story-telling. It reminds me of how old time action movies pump up our adrenaline where the event occurs only in a few hours long, just like in ""Die Hard"" (1988) or ""Speed"" (1994). Tony Scott who is the brother of Ridley Scott (also Director) always knows how to make a precise recipe for a good action movie. If you want to search for drama, Ridley is the man. But if you want to experience some good actions, you find Tony, like what he did in ""Top Gun"" (1986) and my favorite crime thriller ""True Romance"" (1993). It starts slow with problematic introduction, and then as the train goes faster, the tension goes greater as well. Scott pins down a suitable direction for each of its technical aspects. The sounds are so rich and realistic, you can actually feel the threaten train is chugging and rushing in front of your seat. And the hand -shake camera simply drags you into center of the situation and forces you to think along how to solve the complication. The camera work and movement is really effective and outstanding. Going to the same direction, all Cast members are in good shape. Everyone can deliver a believable working class presentation. The costume and makeup support that completely. It seems to me, it is a piece of cake for Denzel to merge into thiz kind of movie. And our Star Trek's new Capt. Kirk, Chris Pine can eventually bring balance into their interaction. Rosario Dawson also shows significant existence for her supporting role. Maybe the story has been exaggerated and dramatized to make it more interesting. Like it or not, Scott has created one great vessel of effective high octane action with his own way. Like on the movie, the train company's executive once said, ""It is my train! It is my decision!""

Denzel is so hammy in this role every time he speaks its like is speaking with a mouth full of cotton wool you can hear what he is saving he's just hamming it up for the camera and the audience, and its like he knows it too. Under Siege 2 is a film on a train but at least this is engaging and has more to it than Unstoppable. With a couple of pointless references to our hero's back story its just two guys on a train. Its not a poor film just a dull film, the sort of thing you watch on a rainy Saturday afternoon.",Unstoppable
147,bburns,"Well done, if derivative",8,16 February 2011,"I generally dislike disaster movies. Either they are like the recent ""Sanctum"", which imperils two-dimensional characters that I can't connect with and therefore don't care about. Or they are like the overrated ""Titanic"", which gives so much time to the story of the romance-novel characters that the actual disaster seems perfunctory. But ""Unstoppable"" gives us three-dimensional characters with realistic back-stories, but it still keeps its focus on the plot.You may have noticed that I never used the word ""original"" in the opening paragraph. That's because, although well-written and realistic (considering that it is--after all--based on a true story), all the characters and plot points easily fit templates that have gone before in prior movies: a young rookie (Chris Pine) is partnered with a grizzled veteran (Denzel Washington); one is newly separated and not allowed to see his child, and the other is a widower with two grown daughters; the boss (Kevin Dunn) is a control freak more concerned with the bottom line than doing the right thing and keeps making boneheaded mistakes; the runaway train narrowly misses crashing into hundreds of schoolchildren on a field trip; etc.But I like the fact that action-master Tony Scott never gives us cookie-cutter variations of the stock characters. He casts the film with good-to-great actors who take pride in making us believe their performances, and the screenplay by Mark Bomback never feels lazy or forced (except for the awful last two lines of dialog).If you're looking for a genre-busting game-changer of an action flick, go rent Hitchcock or Tarantino. But if you want a solidly done McGuffin-free disaster film that puts the story over hackneyed romance and acting ahead of FX, this is the film for you--not ""Twister"", ""Pearl Harbor"" or ""The Perfect Storm"".",Unstoppable
148,rawiri42,Edge of your seat awesome!!!,9,19 May 2012,"WOW!! What a movie! OK, I admit that I'm a railway enthusiast (although my thing is steam and not really diesels - I call them 'diseasels') but this has to be an edge-of-your-seat thriller with a believable story line which is refreshing when one considers most thrillers where the plot is decidedly fragile. Not so this one folks! Of course, for it to be a thriller obviously needs a combination of errors, stupidity and incompetence to all happen together for the scene to be set. But again, all the factors that led to the 777 debacle WERE believable. The result, very loosely based on a true incident, is a heart-stopping drama from beginning to end. Can Denzel Washington do no wrong? He was great in the Book of Eli, Pelham 123 and The Great Debators and, what's more, he's an all-round god guy in real life too. Chris Pine's character was a little bit annoying with his domestic problems causing him to be one of those factors that contributed but, in the bigger picture, that wasn't a major distraction. And, again, Rosario Dawson gives a performance that can only enhance her reputation (and future prospects).The only scene in the whole movie that lets it down (for me) is where the runaway train goes around Stanton Curve with the inside wheels off the tracks. I suppose that it was just feasible but, having driven trains, I doubt very much that any fully-loaded train would have got away with it for so long - with or without guide-rails! Also, it was difficult to figure out why the two locomotives that originally ran in front of the runaway in an attempt to slow it kept coming apart from it since they were going slower - but I admit that's being a bit picky over such a good movie. And, of course, the title is somewhat inaccurate since the train WAS stopped wasn't it?I can't wait to watch it again - but, next time, I'll invite some friends around to share it! I gave it 9 out of 10.",Unstoppable

151,moviemaniac008,Popcorn entertainment at it's best!,8,5 December 2010,"Just got back from a screening of ''Unstoppable''. I have to say, I came out pretty impressed. Unstoppable is the definition of popcorn entertainment: Just like this summer's ''The Expendables'', or ''Machete'', this is the perfect movie to just sit back with your popcorn and drink, and enjoy without asking yourself too many questions. I must admit that as much as I enjoyed this movie, I felt that the beginning was pretty slow, and I was actually starting to ask myself if this was the real, high-octane thrill ride it had promised itself to be, but after 20 to 25 minutes, I got my answer: It's definitely one hell of a thrill.Based on actual events that happened in May 2001, the film centers around two men (Denzel Washington and Chris Pine), who work inside a train and who risk their lives to save a train with molten phenol, which is material that, if it had to come into contact with the oil tanks in Stanton (Pennsylvania), could cause massive damages. Sure, the movie was very exaggerated in some scenes: One of them in particular was when Washington's character jumps wagon to wagon like it's no big deal when actually, there's 70 miles per hour winds blowing straight in his direction. But then again, stunts are stunts and the exaggeration only happens a few times, for entertainment purposes only.The screenplay is well-written, giving us a good amount of character development, and the direction is great. The main leads, Pine and Washington, give amazing performances that will probably not earn them any Oscars, but were very good for that type of movie. In fact, every actor in this movie was good. The visual effects are also good, and the thrill ride is intensely gripping. My two friends and I were literally on the edge of our seats, and there is a moment of relief when the film ends, where you can actually release your breath (you'll probably hold your breath during last hour and ten minutes of the movie).This film is pure entertainment, it is the perfect definition of a popcorn movie. But due to some pretty unrealistic moments and a slow beginning, it is not a perfect movie. Still, it still ranks a solid 8 out of 10 and I promise you will not be disappointed with this movie.",Unstoppable
152,VinceGambini,Solid middle ground,5,16 October 2020,"I keep this short. The acting and direction are okay, the script leaves much to be desired (like what do we need Denzel's daughters for, why does Darcy have nothing to say, why wasn't Ned flown to a place closer to the train and get a truck there) but these are not major issues. What ruins the film is once again the camerawork by Ben Seresin, just like in World War Z. A horrible shakycam mess. Not Tony Scott's greatest work but also not the worst I've ever seen. Just not really exciting. A shame because Denzel and Pine are good.",Unstoppable
153,austin-takahashi,Unstoppable (Quick Review) - 3 Stars,6,14 May 2012,"The runaway train in ""Unstoppable"" makes a pretty threatening villain. It weighs thousands and thousands of tons. It is carrying dangerous chemicals and is speeding out of control without an engineer, or anyone. It wants no ransom, makes no demands, and not open to any negotiations. Stand in its way, and you're on your own. An engineer and a conductor attempts to stop it before it crushes a lot of stuff. ""Unstoppable"", directed by Tony Scott, is well-made, competently acted, and suspenseful. And, and, uhhh Darn it! I had a feeling this was going to be a Quick Review.Official review here: http://localmoviereview.com/unstoppable-quick- review/",Unstoppable
154,wadechurton,Look at da choo-choo,2,26 December 2010,"And now ladies and gentlemen, we have the gripping story of a runaway train and the many valiant attempts to stop it. In order to impress upon us the urgency and turbulence of the developing situation, our director has seen fit to keep the camera moving in a distractingly hyperactive fashion, be it a quiet personal confrontation between characters or overloud footage of the train bowling along at speed. Among the jerky hand-held, constantly-moving camera-work is one technique which wore me down very quickly indeed, and that was the quick, rough zoom I have termed the 'gawk'. Once established, the 'gawk' is a constant companion throughout 'Unstoppable', just like an annoyingly bored and sugar-primed kid next to you on a long bus trip. The movie's characters are but ciphers, with Denzel Washington (obviously now in 'money, dear boy' mode) as the best-known face. The would-be trainstoppers are a pretty lame bunch, but then how can mere humans stop something so determined to wreak havoc? The iron behemoth known as '777' (one worse than 666?) puts itself into gear, takes off with an audible moan, and proceeds to charge through the countryside laying waste. It growls bestially, travels at whatever speed it damn well feels like, and acts downright malevolently any time anyone tries to shut it down. Apparently 'Unstoppable' has been in development hell since 2004, and frankly it looks like it's been there since 1984. The CGI is brief, but rest assured it looks like it was done at 3 AM after a long cocktail evening. 'Unstoppable' is basically 'Christine' with a train, but shh; you didn't hear that from the director All it would have taken is some expository dialogue about how 777 fell over at the factory and killed three workmen and we would be away. Yet despite so much evidence to the contrary, we were evidently meant to accept the story as non-supernatural. Add to this several ridiculously stupid (the cops shooting at the train, driving in Blues Brother fashion, etc.) and physically impossible moments and you have a movie which doesn't work even if you do turn your brain off. All in all though, we did have a good time poking fun at this the other day, and in closing let it be said that believing in a malevolent train is not far down the road from accepting that both of Denzel's character's rather modestly endowed daughters work at Hooters.",Unstoppable
155,jonnyhavey,A Tony Scott Roller Coaster,6,25 November 2010,"Tony Scott teams up with Denzel Washington for the fourth time in his five most recent films he has directed. Scott always picks very interesting stories to formulate action flicks and has centered his latest film around the true story of a runaway train in Pennsylvania. Frank Barnes (Denzel Washington) is in his element as a train engineer who has been working on trains for as long as conductor Will Colson (Chris Pine) has been breathing. Both of these different men are down on their luck when their lives do not turn out how they thought that they would. Frank's two daughters are waitresses at Hooters while Will's wife does not even want to speak to him because of a recent misunderstanding. Therefore, they both have something to prove and team up in order to save the town of Stanton from its demise. They are guided down the train tracks by Rosario Dawson's character Connie Hooper on this action thrill ride that brings up the question: how much was the story sensationalized? And what's the deal with Tony Scott and train movies recently (The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3)?This is a very modest action flick released one week prior to the start of one of the largest box office seasons of the year. The sole purpose of the film is to entertain you for an hour and thirty-eight minutes and then send you on your way. Together Denzel Washington and Chris Pine take an average script and turn it into a story that will keep you on the edge of your seat. They are strongly supported by some very good sound and film editing that brings the train alive. The mixture of the train's engine with the path it carves through the air helps create the high adrenaline atmosphere of the film and the dangers of the moving bomb has on the world around it.Rosario Dawson strikes out once again with another lifeless role in which she just goes through the motions, but doesn't really get anywhere. She is joined by Ethan Suplee (My Name Is Earl) with his weak portrayal of the man who is at fault for the runaway train. The film is also hurt by the overdramaticized lives of both Frank Barnes and Will Colson who in the end are just dealing with normal minute problems that are actually very fixable. The symbolism is very obvious comparing the fixing of their problems to the catching of the runaway train, which also seems to be sensationalized.The film is like a roller coaster ride that you have been on before, but has been remodeled. It is very thrilling while you are on it; however, once the ride is over you go along minding your own business and move to the next ride. Therefore I recommend waiting for DVD for this flick and seeing it in an area where you can really feel the action through the speakers, or the entire affect of the film will be lost.",Unstoppable
156,kevinmorice,Solid disaster movie,7,30 March 2011,"OK, so it's a bit predictable and you have seen most of it before, but that doesn't stop this from being a great movie. Strong but perfectly understated performances from Washington, Pines and Dawson lift the story. They deliver some well-written script with class and some over-written script with a subtlety that rescues it from becoming a distraction. The train itself also delivers a great performance. I was struggling to spot any of the CGI and the overlaid soundtrack of the menacing beast gives the train itself a character. It isn't a Jaws or an Alien, but it is definitely a presence on the screen that wraps you up in the emotion of the movie.On the negatives: The camera work is a bit choppy for my personal taste but it does work to build the tension and Scott does have the good sense to minimise it whilst building the back-story for the protagonists.And the press conference at the end is a bit of a cheesy set-piece that doesn't really fit and could have been dropped, it leaves an unfortunate bad taste and the high-pace rap music that kicks into the credits simply doesn't fit (20seconds later the more fitting orchestral piece comes in but by then it is too late as everyone is rushing out the door).",Unstoppable

Though not terrible this film, a near utter waste of time and money. (especially money) And trying to make a runaway train seem so dramatic? That's like trying to squeeze lemon juice from a curling iron. Makes no sense? About as much sense as this film.So formulated, so boring from any kind of creative level and so disappointing because of the supposed talent surrounding this, uh, film. It was like taking most every box cutter idea from film, then trying to make something up because you've got a known director and once A list actor.The storyline, so predictable. The camera shots, so predictable. I mean any film fan could see most every line of dialogue, scene switch and whats coming up next from a mile away. The characters from the wise old man to the young up and comer who's got an attitude yet they bond, so overdone and rehashed. The crummy boss that knows no better however we know and can do so much better so we're gonna buck the system even at the cost of our job. The supposedly quirky character to the sacrifice character to seeing the drama unfold on TV to bring distant characters back into fold. I mean, what a total waste of anything good.

159,montera_iulian,The main problem with this is that if you've seen Tony Scott's movies before you definitely seen this one already,6,17 December 2010,"Unstoppable is about a veteran engineer (Frank/Denzel Washington) and a young conductor (Will/Chris Pine) who race against time to prevent a railroad catastrophe. They have to stop a moving train at full speed that carries a cargo full of chemical products, so they engage in a pursuit to catch the train from the back and accelerate in the opposite direction in order for the train to slow down. This is a story based on real facts so we already know the process and the result of this brave act. On the other hand, the movie impresses by it's suspense. It really managed to create an intense atmosphere through this fast railroad journey. There aren't really many things that you could say about the storyline but you do have a sense of cheesiness and dullness at one points. The whole presentation and process of this story is drawn too fast and it just puts you there in the middle of all things. It doesn't shock you, nor it really impresses you emotionally. You just look at it, want to see how they did it, but in the end you don't care anymore about anything. The movie is too simple, too straight-forward, too vague for you to really care for something at the end of it, and this I think makes the movie to not be as good as it could have been.It's ridiculous to see Denzel portraying the same character in less than two years, it's not it's a bad thing but I'm kinda bored by his style. He needs to change things, to approach different kind of movies. Chris Pine on the other hand did a decent job, as much as the script let him, and I'm looking forward to see him caring a movie as the leading role. Visually this movie has Tony Scott's fingerprint all over it, and if you saw Man on Fire, Pelham or Deja Vu, then you know what I'm talking about. Shaky cams, fast editing, blurry images, high contrast and so on. What I was a little bit disappointed in was the score which sounded at times like a copy of The Dark Knight score by Hans Zimmer...Other than that, the movie looks good, it's a decent intense portrayal of this little dangerous adventure but I can't see this as more than just a DVD rental... The main problem with this is that if you've seen Tony Scott's movies before you definitely seen this one already.",Unstoppable
160,the_rattlesnake25,Pine & Washington save this runaway wreck...,4,27 November 2010,"Tony Scott returns to the big screen with his fourth film in five years, and just like the previous three, 'Unstoppable' fits the mould as mediocre-fanfare that will casually keep your attention focused on-screen for an hour and a half. Frank (Denel Washington) is the twenty-eight year old railroad veteran who is placed together with newcomer Will (Chris Pine) for a day working on the tracks. However this is no ordinary day, after fellow railroad worker Dewey (Ethan Suplee) accidentally sends a train out on the main tracks unmanned, it is left to the master and his potential prodigy to overcome their differences and attempt to stop the train before it kills thousands in Stanton, Pennsylvania.The film's premise is as silly as it sounds, but most importantly, it's just not that entertaining in general. It's only saving grace is the relationship between the veteran actor, and always reliable Denzel Washington and the relative new Star Trek prince, Chris Pine. The dialogue between these two characters is quick witted, funny, awkward, and incredibly natural, and their developing rapport keeps the film ticking over. Aside from Washington and Pine, Scott once again resorts to over-paced editing and desperately quick cuts, which make the film, feel more like a music video, than a motion picture. While the action itself, at the centre of the narrative, is constantly undermined by Scott's need to juxtapose the action of the train itself, with current live news reports from the outlets around the country which thoroughly detracts away from the audiences enjoyment of the film, as it removes any notion of surprise, or revelation as we constantly know where the train is heading, and when it will arrive at that location.In 'Unstoppable,' everything is laid bare by Tony Scott in regards to the story, so the audience can refocus its attention towards the action shown on-screen, which is not only degrading to the spectators, but also a surprisingly backward step for a director who has yet to break the mould of mediocrity in more than eleven years. Despite attempts to create tension, suspense and an action-orientated picture, Scott instead has succeeded in creating a dull pseudo-documentary in a sense, on how the locomotive is still a powerful beast, that needs man's full attention.",Unstoppable
161,TheHrunting,"Unhalting, undaunting and ultimately unboring",8,22 June 2011,"This was exaggerated for cinematic popcorn entertainment but was inspired by true events after a series of mistakes and unusual circumstances led to a growing catastrophe on the rise, and a team of people who work for a train yard try and systematically correct them before it's too late.In Pennsylvania, a driver on his way out to retirement named Frank Barnes (Denzel Washington) and a rookie conductor called Will Colson (Chris Pine) on his way in are assigned to do a simple job by transporting a set of railway cars. Both attempt to get along, though there's an air of seniority with unions, loyalty and time spent on the job. After an innocent accident on another railway yard with a train left in the auto position, with no air brakes and no man behind the controls, these two men act as a self-sacrificing team that go out of their way in an unselfish attempt to halt the growing problem. In their personal lives, both men have relationships that they're trying to hold onto that give them a driving point to succeed. Denzel Washington takes on the role of the hardworking guy who's knowledgeable and speaks with deadpan humor. Chris Pine plays a guy in between places who's attempting to make an impression and fit in.Connie (Rosario Dawson) makes the moves from the central station but has to combat physical complications, such as other trains getting in the destructive path and coordinating with local authorities, not to mention politics with the corporate suits and ties if it wasn't stressful enough. This is capable of managing technicalities by making them understandable and seamlessly tie-in with the story without having to take a break to explain. This is similar to ""Speed"" in that you feel like you're a crowd participant and are going through the trials and errors along with the on-screen characters, who feel as real as the sweat running down your brow and the nails you just bit off in anticipation. Some of the conventions have been done before but how it was done made all the difference.This is shot similarly to Tony Scott's ""Man on Fire."" It has loose hand-held cameras, out of focus zooms and momentary steady shots to catch the scenery and keep things on the move. ""Unstoppable"" is a basic, straight-forward film, though with tons of struggles to make up the in-between that leads into a climactic finale. What makes it work is that something is continually happening and the way it was edited together gives the film steady tension to cheer along with in the bleachers for the players to actually pull it off.

Due to a series of errors a 39-car train that is carrying toxic chemicals is running at full power with no one controlling it. Unless it can be stopped it will crash in a populated area.Of course a trainload of kids is in the same area. It never rains but it pours.Connie Hooper (Rosario Dawson), is an executive at the railroad company who is trying to coordinate the attempts to solve the problem. One attempt by a 26-year rail veteran to stop the thing by allowing his locomotive to be caught by the runaway, then applying his brakes, fails because no-one has thought about transferring a driver between the two trains. It doesn't help that he keeps accelerating away, then backing up again. He doesn't feature for very long.Next, Frank decides he and Will can stop it themselves...You will already gather that the movie requires all brain activity to be turned off. It's not easy to watch because of the camera gymnastics. You don't ultimately care for any of the characters due to the poor script. There's a complete lack of humour, or suspense.

It was very well directed and filmed, with great shots of the rugged hills and gritty old industrial towns of western PA, and the blue collar workers who live there. The screenplay was also very good, with no down time at all. Everything clicked from start to finish.Denzel Washington was great in the lead role of Frank, a grizzled railroad veteran who only has a few weeks to go until his forced retirement. Chris Pine (better known as Capt. Kirk in the recent fabulous Star Trek remake) plays young hotshot Will, who is teamed up with Frank to make a routine train run.While Frank and Will are doing their thing, a 39 car train heavily loaded with hazardous chemicals is left unmanned by Dewey, played by Ethan Supplee as pretty much the Randy character he played on ""My Name is Earl"". Dewey gets off the train to throw a switch (a big no-no) and left it in gear. The gear slips forward and off the train goes. The rest of the movie involves everyone in the great state of Pennsylania trying to stop it.This is where Frank and Will work their magic.I recommend this movie highly and don't think anyone who sees this will walk out disappointed.",Unstoppable

Well you can ask director Tony Scott, because his last two movies are about trains. You would figure after making ""Pelham 1,2,3"", he wouldn't want to make another train movie with Denzel.....but yet here we are. Don't get wrong, Tony Scott is a good director. He has made some good ones with ""True Romance"" and ""Man on Fire"", but as of lately, he has lost a lot of his luster. Hopefully he can bounce back with his next train picture.....sorry, that just sounds funny.Okay, the premise of this movie is pretty easy to wrap your head around. It's about a train, thats out of control. And the best part is, the movie tells it just like that. It doesn't add any stupid over dramatic twist or turns, or long drawn out boring sequences. It follows the pace of the train, which is very refreshing for an action movie, because i haven't seen one of those in a very long time. Think of it like the movie ""Speed"", well, maybe not as good as Speed, but you know that pace that never seems to let up.....it is very relative to that.And thats really it.....i mean, there isn't a whole bunch to tell. It's just one of those sit down and have fun action movies. In fact, it's one of those action movies that your mother will watch, and she will not shut up about how much she enjoyed it. And your like ""Mom, it was pretty good, but not that good"", and then she's like ""Oh, and who was that one guy, you know, not Denzel, but the other guy"" and your like ""Chris Pine? The guy from the new Star Trek"", and your moms like ""Yeah, he's cute, i like him"", and then by that point you leave the room because she's annoying you.......yes, this is that type of movie.Bottom Line....if you enjoyed those 90's action movies where the plot is simple and the action is elaborate, then you will really enjoy this movie.",Unstoppable

168,james1844,Great Action Thriller But Fails To Be Authentic,3,6 November 2010,"Lets begin by saying a train film has to be authentic and too many times the elements of this film fall miserably short. Realism is a must for real R.R. people. Few R.R. films live up to that plateau. The last one that came close was Runaway Train w/ John Vought many yrs ago.Back to Unstoppable..I commend the cast and crew for a reasonably very good film. I just want to be convinced by actual R.R. tactics. For instance: When the train is traveling at break neck speeds and the 1st attempt was to have an engine get out ahead of the 777 and slow it down why didn't someone join the engineer and simply walk the side of the saving engine onto the run-a-way and bring it to a stop? Maybe because the movie would have ended at about 20 minutes. That would never do. The thing is, why don't movie makers consult with real R.R. people that know the way of the Iron Horse and the inner workings of trains.

169,theycallmemrglass,"Enjoyable, none too taxing, adrenaline filled movie",7,9 November 2010,"Watched this at a London preview screening.The film was fun as I expected from a Tony Scott film. I pretty much dig most of his movies that I've seen since Last Boy Scout. Thing is, he hasn't really evolved and has pretty much the same formula which makes these films quite predictable now. The story was very very simplistic and if it wasn't for the fact that just a month ago we had our own runaway train in the London Underground, I would have thought the story implausible! But these are fairly small points because the action scenes (though surprisingly few) were good. What I like about Tony Scott films is that you get some decent stunt work without the temptation to use too much CGI. I really like the brooding attitude of Chris Pine and although not as sparking as in his Kirk role in Star Trek, he had his moments to shine. Denzel was as usual the solid backbone of the film and without him, it would be a much lesser film. There was plenty of humour and an overall kinetic energy (helped by the speeding trains)which kept my adrenaline going.",Unstoppable
170,Supachewy,Unstoppable Guarantees Unstoppable Entertainment,6,17 November 2010,"The action film Unstoppable is directed by Tony Scott and stars Denzel Washington, Chris Pine, and Rosario Dawson. The film takes place in modern day Pennsylvania.The film centers around how a train yard worker named Dewey does not properly secure one of the trains. Because of this the train travels along the tracks at a hazardous speed and over on hundred thousand lives are on the line if it is not stopped because according to the physics it will derail on the Stanton curve and go into explosive materials that will likely destroy the town. A veteran engineer (Washington), Frank Barnes, and a first day conductor (Pine), Will Colson, decide to take the task to stop the train even if they lose their own lives in the process. No one thinks they are able to do it from the company that manages the trains except Connie Hooper (Dawson), the yard master. Can Frank Barnes and Will Colson stop the train before it reaches its tragic destination? Or is it unstoppable? The screenplay from Mark Bomback is quite entertaining, even though it is also quite corny. It is the basic action movie where the protagonist must stop the antagonist (in this case the train) before the antagonist accomplishes its deadly goal. And like all those films this one is equally as predictable. There is not much character development throughout the film, it is basically at the beginning of the film Frank and Will don't like each other and as it goes on they start to like each other. During the leisure time on their ride to catch the train they tell about their family lives to add another layer of drama to the script and make the climax even more sentimental. On a more positive note the whole way through the film is very entertaining and will keep you satisfied during it, but in the upcoming days you may forget that you have ever seen it.Tony Scott is a veteran director and this is his fifth collaboration with actor Denzel Washington. I really like a lot of the shot choices Scott employed, such as the many shots underneath the train. Another shot thought was very well done was when the train collided with the tractor that was on the train track, basically all the shots involving the trains were good. the performances that Scott was able to get from his actors are appropriate to the level of the film, he didn't really get any bad ones. Tony Scott is always a director worth watching because almost all of his films are entertaining and great to watch when you aren't looking for something tiring.The strongest aspect of the film was probably the high pace editing by Robert Duffy Chris Lebenzon. It kept the excitement way up in a film which could have been quite boring. If it wasn't for their editing it would just be two guys following a train, but Duffy and Lebenzon added the excitement and flare to the film. I really liked the sounds they put in when cutting the Connie Hooper in the train headquarters and how it just went to talking, no time to wait, just like in the actual film.The acting was mediocre in this film, which is disappointing because there are three very talented actors in the film. The first being the two time Oscar winning Denzel Washington who seemed like he was just on cruise control for this movie. He played the part but didn't add himself into it, there was no passion. When you watch Washington in a film like Training Day you can feel that he is going all out to be spectacular, but in this he does not have that type of drive. Chris Pine who became a success for his role in the new Star Trek gave a fine performance but nothing too great. So far in his career he has not really proved that he is an acting force even though he does have a very likable charm to him, hopefully in the future he will give a strong performance that shows how he deserves to be the lead in films. Rosario Dawson played her part as Connie Hooper just right as well, but it did not have much character in it so she could not really show off her acting ability. The supporting cast all did fine, no one really to complain about.Overall I give this film a 6/10, it is a fun ride but is forgetful when you get home from the theatre. It does look like at the next family dinner Tony Scott can go to his brother Ridley and laugh how people like his latest movie unlike Ridley's latest Robin Hood. If you are looking for something not too serious head to the theatre now to give this a watch, especially if you are as big of a Denzel Washington fan as I am.",Unstoppable

Anyhoo it is a very exciting film at times but it's also ridiculous. Even the actors expressions seem to be be saying: ""How in holy hell did I agree to this?""

174,demetrius11,"This movie is so bad, that you just have to watch it...",3,25 January 2011,"I chose for today's review a movie I tried very hard to watch this Sunday. Unstoppable (2010) This movie for some unknown reason has actually a decent review on the IMDb. A 7 !!! However, after I was 10 minutes in the movie the 7 became a 5. After another 15 minutes the 5 became a 3, and it stayed a 3 till 10 minutes before the ending due to the fact that I stopped watching.Why you ask.This movie has no script, no plot, not a single line of dialog worth listening to, some of the shallowest characters that I have ever seen, and is filled with clichés. Once again two good hard working Americans fight to prevent some huge disaster ! However the greatness of the middle class working man manages to overcome the stupid evil capitalists, and through selfless acts save the day, despite the great depression of the American economy, and despite the fact that their personal lives have gone down the drain. All gets well in the end. They are heroes, their friends and families love them again, and their bosses think of them as gods.The cast is good. However why they accepted to be in a movie with no scrip is beyond my knowledge. Tony Scott (the director), is directing the way a young film student would direct. Even though he is a very good director overall, and has worked on some quite good projects (like The Pillars of the Earth for example) this one did not work out for him. There are moments in the movie (like the Washington-Dawson-Train scene near the end) where I was actually laughing due to the terrible direction and dialog.I guess that this move is so bad that you'll have to watch it to believe me. So go ahead and watch it ! I highly recommend it as the worst movie of this month.",Unstoppable
175,LaurieMann,Don't Stop for Unstoppable,5,14 November 2010,"I'm not much for action adventure type movies, because they are mostly a mess of illogic. Unstoppable is no exception. I'm surprised that the reviews have been as positive as they have been. I'll admit it's a little exciting in places, but it really didn't hold my interest very much. The script has almost every action movie cliché and stock character you can imagine. Tiresome.I'd like to say it was well-made, but the photography swings so much that it gets a little dizzying. I suppose that's part of the point - keep the audience off-balance so they can't think very much during the movie.There are also stupid continuity problems. For whatever reason, while the movie is clearly set in Western Pennsylvania and a few scenes are actually set in Pittsburgh, the production decided to put in fake town names. I'm pretty sure the ending sequences were shot in Wheeling, West Virginia. So why not say the train was going to wind up in Wheeling? Why make up the name of another city that's larger than Pittsburgh but roughly in the Pittsburgh area?Much of the movie was shot in small towns outside of Altoona, where train tracks parallel small country roads for a long time. One thing that was too bad is one of the most striking train vistas in the region is the Horseshoe Curve, which runs along a hill overlooking a valley. For whatever reason, they didn't/couldn't shoot from there.At one point early in the movie, you see Channel 11 weather on in the background. It shows the highs in the 90s in southwestern Pennsylvania the day of the ""train incident."" At the end of the movie (which is either late in the day of train incident or maybe the next day), people are wearing mittens and scarves.The acting was just tiresome. I've been a big fan of Denzel Washington, but he's done this upright/blue collar guy a lot over the last few years, and I know he can do better than this. Chris Pine is still so-so. The only performance that was at all interesting was Rosario Dawson who is stuck in a train control center for the entire movie. But she was the only person in this movie with any spark.What made the movie kind of tolerable in places was comparing/contrasting corporate/government reaction in Unstoppable (which was shot in the fall 2009) and the BP oil disaster (which happened in mid-2010). You can almost see top-level corporate reaction in both being the same; that some of the people on the ground might have had a few clues but where generally ignored. The one federal government part in Unstoppable was played by a guy who initially seemed like he'd be part of the problem, but he wound up being part of the solution.So if you like a movie that basically screams ""I'm a big video game,"" you might like Unstoppable.

This reminds me a lot of the 1973 TV movie Runaway! starring Ben Johnson and Ben Murphy. Don't miss it if you like runaway train movies where the bystanders like to see the action up close...of course nothing bad could happen to people who are just curious of what is going on.

177,spencerthetracy,A Hodgepodge of Moments,5,13 November 2010,"**Contains Spoilers** You would think that with this kind of talent any film would be thrilling and riveting, not the infuriating throw-together that it is. Firstly there was a series of inconsistencies that plaque the film. Secondly, some dialogue had nothing to do with the action at hand. Thirdly, Tony Scott was being very artistic with his reaction shots. Timing and editing was awful. A few scenes bordered on the ridiculous. For example at 'Dead Man's Curve' the train is going so fast (Oh boy) that it actually tips and rides one rail at a 45 degree angle. Don't all trains do this? I got the feeling that they filmed many scenes with lots of dumb dialogue and shook the camera as much as they could and then threw it all together and hoped it would make sense in the end. But it doesn't and it shows.And something final: I live in Pennsylvania near where this all takes place and I've never heard of this event. Talk about taking liberties.",Unstoppable
178,gfrancis0,Very average and predictable,4,21 May 2011,"I was expecting at least an interesting ""blockbuster movie experience"" but this film ended up with mostly the wise old codger (Denzel) proving over and over how experienced he was with the young buck (Pine) learning that maybe he didn't know it all along the way, snore. The corporate types are shown as idiots, of course, and there are constantly multiple helicopters flying about 6 feet away from the train and each other, both of those are totally believable. Even how it starts is ridiculous. Disconnect the brakes, put the engine at full throttle, jump out and then don't tell anyone or ask for help until is it long gone that this might be a little teeny weeny problem. You almost knew to the second what was going to happen when, including the train just barely hanging on in the treacherous curve that they had been talking about for almost the entire movie. You even that it would go up on two wheels in that scene before it happened. WAY too many lame attempts to (unsuccessfully) generate drama and suspense. Fuel storage tanks surrounding the dangerous curve? Sure, why not? I am disappointed that they didn't put a nuclear power plant there with a big target for the most vulnerable spot to hit with a train. I also agree with other reviewers that I have never seen hundreds of cops show up and make so many road blocks nearly instantaneously in the middle of nowhere like that, they didn't need to show a dozen of them for the movie. Believe it or not, showing a roadblock as a train goes by is NOT that exciting, Tony Scott.

181,jjgooner,Brilliant Entertainment,7,19 July 2013,"Unstoppable*** (out of 4)98 mins/ 12Cast: Denzel Washington, Chris Pine, Rosario Dawson, Ethan Suplee, Kevin Dunn, Kevin Corrigan, Kevin Chapman, Lew Temple, T.J Miller, Jessy Schram, David Warshofsky, Elizabeth Umberger, Meagan TreadyDirector: Tony Scott Plot: An ageing engineer and a rookie conductor go chasing an unmanned train full of dangerous chemicals, that is hurling towards a heavy populated city at high speeds.JJ's Verdict: If you can get past the completely dull, motionless and totally boring first half an hour, you are rewarded with some great performances from Chris Pine and Denzel Washington, intense train chases and a thrill ride like no other.Unstoppable is about a veteran train engineer and his first day on the job conductor who decide to chase after an unmanned freight train full of toxic and explosive materials which was accidentally left alone on full power . Unless the train can be stopped and slowed down, it will crash into a city of 100,000 population and cause mass destruction of lives and civilisation.In Unstoppable, Denzel Washington and Tony Scott team up for the fifth time overall, after Crimson Tide, The Talking of the Pelham 1 2 3, Déjà vu and Man on Fire but their second train film together after 2007's The Talking of the Pelham 1 2 3. The film starts off very poor unfortunately. When watching a film about an unmanned train travelling at 80 mph and destroying everything in its path, we want to see that. However, we are only given about a minute in total at the start and in its place is some very slow dialogue scenes between Pine and Washington featuring boring train jargon and each playing stereo-typed versions of themselves. Some could say that director Tony Scott just does this to keep you waiting and interested in seeing the train. I personally believe that the early scenes are just bad. Pure and Simple. Despite this, when the chase does begin, it's like nothing you've ever seen before.It takes an awful lot to upstage Denzel Washington and, while the Oscar winning 'Training Day' actor does well here, that freight train is the star of the show. With stunning camera-work and sharp editing used to his advantage, Tony Scott has created one of the most terrifying pieces of transport you're ever likely to see on film. The train itself defines fast and furious. All scenes that show attempts to slow it down are superbly choreographed and provide adrenaline- pumping thrills and entertainment. Washington and Pine still show their worth towards the film's climax as they both face an emotional struggle to prevent the train from crashing and both make you care about their characters, which also down to clichéd but well-presented sub-plots. Rosario Dawson puts in a strong authoritative performance in the control room and there are brief but strong turns from Lew Temple and David Warshofsky.

The thing is though, that this is a film manufactured to amuse the masses who really don't care about logic.I'll admit that there were some exciting scenes, but they were so poorly linked together that they simply failed to cover the gaping plot holes.If you like your thrills when your brain is in neutral then this is a fine film, but any comparisons to ""Speed"" are doing that film a grave injustice.This is just incomprehensibly illogical (captain), and just makes no sense at all. Since I'm writing a non-spoiler review I won't reveal the ending, but I can think of at least five ways that the train could have been stopped far earlier in the film, and the eventual ""Stoppage"" was just one of them.It had its moments, but I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who is looking for a real thrill.",Unstoppable

They make the film appear exciting-- but the reality is, it's even BETTER than the teasers make it look!... The story starts out in a train yard in Pennsylvania. While some of the workers there are diligent, others are at times SLACKERS-- & one of those makes a number of screw-ups that cause a freight train to not have its AIR BRAKES connected & to not even have its ENGINEER on board It turns out that the ""fail-safes"" end up being more FAILURES than safe, & the train starts barreling down the tracks at an increasingly high speed around the countryside. A female schedule-controller named Connie (ROSARIO DAWSON) tries to find a way to STOP the train-- but she has to deal with oblivious ""big-shot"" higher-ups like Galvin (KEVIN DUNN) & certain others who are either overly-concerned with the financial ""bottom-line"" or simply can't properly get the job done In time, the scene shifts to some other rail workers handling another train, in the form of long-time train engineer Frank (DENZEL WASHINGTON) & his new comparatively-young assistant Will (CHRIS PINE) who's having marital troubles that distract his attention Their train happens to be on the same track as the RUNAWAY train, & those two elements start to interact & shall-we-say ""COLLIDE"" with each other It's bad enough having a train out of control, but it's at least doubly bad when it happens to have a number of its cars containing TOXIC CHEMICALS. As Rosario points out, it's like having a traveling guided ""MISSILE the size of the Chrysler Building"" Clearly, the train needs to be stopped (lest it risk badly injuring the populace near the train tracks)— but HOW?!... Those working in the train industry -- including another engineer named Judd Stewart (DAVID WARSHOFSKY) & safety inspector Wemer (KEVIN CORRIGAN) -- keep trying to come up with a SOLUTION to the problems: Can they stop the train by getting someone ONTO it?... Can they somehow CONTROL it?... Can they DERAIL it in a way that there won't be massive damage to the area?... Can other train ENGINES be used to somehow affect its speed?... The movie is a wonderful THRILL RIDE of various attempts to fix the problems. You can bet that DENZEL & CHRIS will be involved, but it's handled with exceptionally superior expertise: a friend of mine, whose father used to work in rail yards, commented that his dad would have LOVED seeing the film, since it does such a fine job in consistently giving you a feeling of the SPEED & POWER of the trains involved & what can go wrong if they're not handled properly It's a FINE adventure, with well-constructed & highly-delineated characters, first-rate acting, an intriguing action-filled story, & I'd rate it 8.5 out of 10 stars",Unstoppable

185,alexart-1,"You're Waiting for a Train (That's Going to Kill You, If You're Not Careful)",4,4 March 2011,"Let's start this review off in a proper manner for this movie, and by that I mean let's make it extremely blunt: Unstoppable is frenetic mess. Sometimes that isn't really all that bad in an action movie. It's worked before in Salt and Cloverfield, to name a few, but Unstoppable simply cannot pull it off. I started watching it with the expectation that I was going to have fun and I ended with a headache. Tony Scott makes the movie tense, that is for sure, but the way he does it is annoying. Though there are occasional instances when Unstoppable is nearly as nail-bitingly suspenseful as its writers hoped, most of the time, it falls flat on its face and (dare I say it?) becomes a train wreck.Unstoppable claims to be inspired by true events. It's not a lie; it actually happened once in Ohio, but the stakes were not as high and nobody was hurt. Like any tabloid magazine, Unstoppable is inevitably sensationalized. It has full right to do this (it's an action movie after all), but not to this extent. The film starts with two stories that don't end up intersecting until halfway through the movie. A young conductor (Chris Pine) and a wise older engineer (Denzel Washington) are paired together to transport twenty train cars of zinc. But their day gets completely derailed (I had to!) when a train goes rogue and starts operating on its own when a worker is an idiot. Meanwhile, back at the station, a train operator (Rosario Dawson) gets angry and yells a lot while somehow acting rationally. The two trains roar closer to each other and the suspense mounts.The film's biggest offense isn't its outlandish story, but rather it's Scott's obnoxious direction. From around ten minutes in, the camera does not stop moving. Yes, I understand that this device is meant to build suspense, but it just ended up frustrating me. What happened to the good old days when it was honorable to use slow movements to create anxiety? Clearly, they're long gone.Not only this, but the editing is equally staccato to match this. As I said before, it's not always so horrible to have this style in an action movie, but sometimes it's nice to get an idea of what I'm supposed to be looking at. Editing shouldn't be used to bewilder the viewer unless that style is somehow needed in the movie.What isn't a mess is the acting. Dawson, Pine, and Washington all play their parts with just the right amount of believability. The characters are not too tangible, but they are not too fake either. Most of the time, the story is also entertaining. Although a bit overlong, Unstoppable's simple plot is enough to entertain the audience...were it not for Tony Scott. I can frankly say that I have never seen a movie with a more bizarre villain than a rogue train. Yep, even weirder than Christine.As it turns out, what Unstoppable comes down to is style. And that was Scott's biggest mistake. Instead of making a slower train-on-the-run like his previous and better film The Taking of Pelham 123, Scott has directed this one like a music video to very little success. You very well may enjoy it more than I did if you can get past the unnecessary intensity of the first third. Still, Unstoppable is a mess. There's simply no other way to say it.",Unstoppable

The film makers have crafted a 140 minute film from that, now that is a skill in itself, but not one that I would say deserves anything more than a shake of the hand.The script is about as engaging as a Japanese anime cartoon (actually IN Japanese), the acting is decent, and the effects are all there, but there is just NO depth at all within the story.I couldn't even care if the train crashed or not by the end, I just wanted the train to stop, which I knew it would, with Denzel at the end.And on that note, I don't understand how they got the stars to star in this film, there must have been some decent pay packets and the only thing I can imagine that got this film to the screens was Tony Scott (Ridley's Brother in tow)...This one, for me is a bit of a howler and 7.1 is very, very, very generous.Oh by the way, watch out for the overused fast camera dolly shots, which are used in nearly every scene, they are horrid camera shots that are designed to give a sense of movement, but they don't, they just look crap and outdated.Save your money and get it on DVD, which is where this film would be without the big names, straight to DVD.",Unstoppable

The action kicks in fairly quickly, within the first 15 or so minutes of the film and there begins the craziness. Denzel Washinton and Chris Pine display a nice bit of chemistry as engineer and conductor respectively, one a member of the ""old guard"" that's being pushed out involuntarily to make way for the ""new blood"". The clash a bit in the beginning but slowly form a believable working relationship. It's nice to see the Federal Railroad Administration inspector (ably played by the low-key Kevin Corrigan) as a helpful character rather than as the usual Hollywood stereotype as ""bumbling government guy who messes stuff up worse"" character. It's refreshing. There are a few minor holes in the plot concerning the way they try to stop the train but overlook those because this movie is a great, old-fashioned action/adventure that keeps rolling along like (forgive me, seriously) a ""freight train"".

191,peteranderson975,Daytime TV disaster movie with a bigger budget,6,30 July 2011,"Unstoppable In a rail yard in Pennsylvania a total idiot called Dewey (Ethan Suplee who plays Earl's brother Randy in My Name is Earl) screws up badly while driving a massive freight train No.777. This train is full of dangerous cargo so Dewey naturally enough doesn't bother connecting the air brakes then jumps off the train to change points. The train speeds off without him. Disaster looms but the scale is not quite grasped as they think the train is coasting without power We learn a bit about rookie conductor Will (Chris Pine) and experienced driver Frank Barnes (Denzel Washington). Union and company politics means Frank faces enforced retirement to make way for younger cheaper workers such as Will Colson (and of course Dewey). Will screws up by attaching five too many cars to the train but Frank keeps going instead of going back and detaching the other cars. Connie Hooper (Rosario Dawson) the yard master gets her chief welder Ned Oldham along with Dewey and another idiot Gilleece to try and intercept the train at a siding. That's when they realise the train is not coasting but is going full throttle and will very likely go off the rails in a heavily populated area, mostly likely into a large fuel dump in the town of Stanton just positioned right under a large S-bend in an elevated section of the track and seemingly designed to result in maximum carnage. Before that we have a train that is full of school kids on a special train safety awareness trip and their train is heading straight for 777. The tension builds as precious little angels sing stupid rail safety songs and the driver turns into a siding and narrowly avoids blood and death for himself and all the little brats. When 777 obliterates a horse box the media soon take an interest. Police and media helicopters buzz around the train and the company vice- president of train operations Oscar Galvin takes charge of trying to stop 777. His mad plan is getting a little train to push it from the front to slow it down enough for a helicopter to smash an ex-marine on a rope into the window of the drivers cabin. As you'd expect hitting the runaway train with a smashed up marine on rope does very little to slow it down very much. And for extra fun the little train that couldn't derails in a ball of flames and a dead driver. After Franks and Will's train has a close encounter with 777 (thanks to the five extra cars) Frank comes up with a plan a little less psychotic than Galvin's. After Galvin fails yet again with a plan to derail the train in a little town it's all up to Frank and Will to stop 777. I really liked the action scenes and the use of the news clips was quite well done - nice way to build up the tension by having it done by rolling news coverage. I suppose they had to get in all that character stuff as well but I wasn't too interested in that. At first I thought Chris Pine was some sort of kiddie stalker but don't worry, it's just his kid and he's separated from his wife, gun - threats - restraining order blah blah blah. Chris Pine didn't really convince me of any of that stuff at all. Fortunately he is okay at the action scenes. Rating 6/10",Unstoppable
192,wolverinesforever,"A little overdone, but it still works",7,15 November 2010,"Some have called this ""Speed"" on a train, and I think the comparison is apt. The plot's simple: a 30+ car train goes loose when it's conductor (Ethan Suplee) gets off and tries to turn a rail switch. The train's running on full throttle and gaining speed, so it's barreling through numerous crossings and towns at 70 MPH. The rail control center, led by Connie Hooper (Rosario Dawson), struggles to come up with ways to stop the train (things are complicated when that train's company intervenes with their own ideas). When the train passes by rail workers Frank Barnes and Will Colson (Denzel Washington and Chris Pine), they decide to speed their train backwards and try to slow down the runaway locomotive.The film's second half is arguably better than the first. The first half is mostly rail control trying to make sense of the situation and trying different (and unsuccessful) ways to stop the runaway train. The second half is where director Tony Scott and actors Washington and Pine pull out all of the thrills, including a white knuckle turn around a sharp curve while Pine tries to apply manual brakes. Both Washington and Pine bring a lot of credibility to their roles, emphasizing their workmanlike backgrounds and having some fun interacting with each other.Scott has a tendency to overcook the style of the film, swooping the camera around too often and shaking it a little too much. A simpler style of shot selection would have sufficed. But he still manages to get the adrenaline going, and in fact makes ""Unstoppable"" exceed ""Speed"" in a couple of ways. First off, while both stories are prone to human error, the human errors in ""Unstoppable"" feel more, well, human. You understand why mistakes are getting made through the mis-communications and conflicting desires. Too often in ""Speed,"" the mistakes left me shaking my head why anyone could be so dumb. Also, I got the impression after watching ""Speed"" that more damage was done and more lives were lost trying to save the bus. I had no such impressions while watching ""Unstoppable""; I knew that train had to be stopped and it had to be stopped now! ""Unstoppable"" isn't one of the year's best thrillers, but it does work, and it sure as heck beats out most of the thrillers we got this summer. You want Tony Scott to pump up the action with respected actors Denzel Washington and Chris Pine in tow? You're going to get it.",Unstoppable

194,Vinegaroon3,It was OK....but not great or original in any way,6,24 November 2010,"Basically this movie is worth seeing, but it is not ground breaking, original, or unique in any way. It might be more a choice for TV or as a Red Box rental rather than paying the $$ to see it in a theater.The acting and characters were decent, but the story is the same tired disaster-epic-style we have been seeing for decades.It was a little over the top the way the movie portrayed the media coverage of the train event....zooming in on the ""heros"" and naming them by name so their families could root for them and the drama quotient could be artificially inflated. Pretty hokey, bordering on silly. Some of the ways in which the movie was filmed were clearly aimed at increasing the dramatic impact of the scene. However, some of these were so ridiculous as to strain the ""suspension of disbelief"" required in movies to the breaking point. For example, the crew that set up the device to derail the train did so right in the middle of a massive crowd of people and vehicles. So had the train been derailed, it would have wiped out everyone in the vicinity. Also, I find it a bit silly that media helicopters covering the event were flying alongside the train, 20 feet from the ground, and perhaps 20 feet from the train. Riiiiiight. Again, I know movies are not reality, but some of these elements were just lame.I might actually be over-rating it slightly, just because I find trains interesting (their size and power) and I enjoyed some of the scenes simply because of that. For those of you with no interest in powerful machinery, knock my rating down to a ""5"".This was just an ""OK"" movie. A decent use of 90 minutes if you have the time and money to use up.",Unstoppable
195,whatever_123,Go See It!,10,15 November 2010,"I really wasn't expecting this movie to be very good. The preview made it look thoughtless and thrown together. I'm glad I went and saw it with my family. Unstoppable had everything to look for in a movie: action, suspense, humor, meaning, good dialog, a story, and of course, explosions.The trailers didn't promote this movie in the best way possible. It makes it look like there's no point; that there's just some random train careening around the tracks for no apparent reason, and crashing into random things that shouldn't even be on the train tracks. Don't be fooled by the crappy commercials. In the movie, there was an explanation of why the train went out of control. The vehicles on the tracks weren't carelessly parked over the train tracks, they were passing through the area and didn't anticipate the monster train coming in their direction.The characters were not shallow and boring, like they make it look like in the commercial. The two main heroes in the movie were very likable. They were both humble heroes; neither came from rich backgrounds, they both had family problems, and yet they went out of their way to put their lives on the line to stop the train. Also, there was a 70s-looking character who served as a comic relief in the movie, who also did his fair share in saving the day.The thing the previews did right was making the movie look exciting. The action scenes were nothing less than amazing. There's something thrilling about watching a half-mile-long train roaring at top speed across the train tracks, with no driver, just waiting for a major catastrophe to happen. The action scenes really pull you in, making you sit on the edge of your seat, chewing on your nails, hoping that the train full of children wouldn't crash into the runaway train, or that the two heroes would somehow manage to stop the runaway train from destroying an entire town. The shaking camera work creates an effect that makes you actually feel how fast the train really is going, and it shows the course of events clearly, so the action scenes aren't a crazy, confusing blur.The thing that really impressed me about this movie was the simple, yet NOT cheesy dialog. Action movies have been RUINED for me by really bad scripts, and tried to make it up with numerous explosions and such. This is not the case with Unstoppable. The dialog seemed real, like the actors were actually... acting! They didn't say anything stupid like ""Dude, we gotta stop this thing,"" or ""Look's like we're screwed."" What also impressed me was that the movie didn't go into a lot of detail about the main characters' lives. They only had a regular small-talk kind of conversation about themselves, and left it at that. They didn't have to go into an extremely long, boring, emotional thing, they just told us what they were all about, and went back to saving the day. The dialog included some humor, too, which wasn't brainless or overdone.So, this review can be summarized in about two sentences: GO TAKE YOUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY TO SEE THIS MOVIE. YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT.",Unstoppable
196,massrer,Terrible,1,1 November 2018,"This is just terribly written movie, for example, they have a guy from helicopter trying to jump on a train that got out of control and in the same time they have other train put in front of the train to slow it down, and no one thought to go from that train to the train because they are stuck together for some time.

197,darth_timon,Good Film,8,21 June 2013,"There are two main reasons I wanted to watch this film. Firstly, I rate Chris Pine quite highly as an actor. Secondly, I like trains. That said, if a half-mile long freight train were barrelling toward me at 70 mile per hour I might feel a little differently.The tension is well-played, with the sense that if the train derails (along with the great many tons of explosive and toxic cargo and fuel) it would be a catastrophe. The veteran engineer and his rookie conductor that go after this beast have their problems at home, but these are never the focus of the film- the film is about an out-of-control train and this remains the focus- the human element is understated but works pretty well (perhaps in part because it's not oversold). Denzel Washington is a really good actor and Pine's star is rising. Rosario Dawson also puts in a competent performance with the material she's got.The filming style uses a lot of 'news' footage to help maintain a sense of realism. This adds to the drama and tension and keeps the film ticking over nicely. I would quite happily watch this again.",Unstoppable

"" The Emperor of the North,"" .. and a real, real oldie "" Union Pacific "" .... So what did these films have that Unstoppable doesn't have ?

In fact most of the leading characters seemed only slightly upset that this uncontrollable behemoth has gotten away . Most scenes are only so-so with just one worthwhile wreak . As the out of control runaway takes-off we are told it's doing upward of 70 miles per hour yet we see it crawling around sharp curves and switches at a leisurely 5 or 10 mph . ( OK they did it in the movie Speed with the bus ) . Denzel Washington has to take time out to call his daughter at Hooters to tell her he loves her . We see lots of people watching the runaway train on TV as the Fox news helicopter is never far behind . I don't like machine guns or automatic weapons in most action movies . I guess you just can't make an exciting movie without the obligatory Rat-Ta-Ta-Ta of an M-16. Yes, the cops do take a few pot-shot at ole' #777 in a feeble attempt to get it to stop . I thought this movie would appeal to most railroad buffs but after reading some comments I guess not . What you get here is something that looks more like a made-for-TV disaster flick. I felt myself nodding off during that last 15 minutes and was happy when it ended . If you enjoy railroad movies or you have small kids that love toy trains, wait for Unstoppable to come out on DVD and watch it with them . I wish they would have given this film a touch of the Final Destination movies . The out of control killer diesel locomotive #666 that seems to have a mind of it's own !

204,csimpkins53,similarities,5,22 February 2011,"""Unstoppable"" has many similarities to a another movie released back in the 1980's titled ""Runaway Train"" Starring Jon Voigt and Eric Roberts. The basic premise of an unmanned locomotive running at high speed is present in both films. The possibility of extreme and/or toxic disaster is a plot device in both films. Also similar is the disagreement among railroad officials concerning how to handle the situation, with one official wanting to derail the train and another official not wanting to derail it. The moving of one train onto a siding while the runaway passes and crashes into the last few cars of the train pulling onto the siding is also present in both movies. In ""Runaway Train"" there is much concern that the speeding train will not make it across an old trestle. In ""Unstoppable"" there is much concern that the speeding train will not be able to negotiate a sharp curve.

Is it even possible for Denzel Washington to make a bad movie? Not in my opinion.Inspired by the 2001 Crazy Eights Train Incident (see info on wikipedia), Unstoppable is about a runaway train that has been in full throttle and carrying extremely hazardous materials. If the train derails, the materials will cause a major catastrophe. An engineer (Denzel Washington) and a conductor (Chris Pine) attempt to chase down the runaway train that is being powered by two locomotives in their single locomotive. Not wanting to see a massive tragedy, they hope to be able to bring the train under control as quickly as possible, despite threats that they will be fired if they pursue.Along with Denzel and Chris, this movie stars a great cast, including Rosario Dawson and Lew Temple.The action will keep you on the edge of your seat and biting your nails.

Where did Tony Scott get the explosives to get that explosion? Wow. The part where Judd Stewart's train is used as a lash-up to slow down 777 is idiotic on Galvin's part, and Connie of course didn't like the plan. But, when Ryan Scott landed on 777, 777 made a weird noise like whale. It probably said, ""Nope."" Then, it hit Judd, knocking Ryan into the other engine's window, and eventually derailing Judd. When it started to derail, it was over. However, when the explosion occurs, you'll find yourself saying, ""Wow!"" You'll love this movie. It does have its flaws, but if you see this movie more than once, the first time you see it, you think, ""This is the greatest movie I've ever seen.""

One thing is certain, we all want to know how Unstoppable will pan out.Against the metallic sounds of heavy trains propelled at blazing speeds across the tracks, pace-setting music and the refined voices of trained actors can be heard.Denzel (Frank) is once again the everyman, reprising a train transport services worker role similar to the one we had already seen him embody in last year's The Taking of Pelham 123.This time he is pitted against newcomer Chris Pine (playing Will) and Rosario Dawson's familiar face as Connie.Roles are aptly performed, so that we can sense Dewey (Ethan Suplee) is going to mess up before he does so; we can tell Galvin (Kevin Dunn) is calling the wrong shots before the entire dimension of his erratic ways is made clear to us; we can somehow sense Ned (Lew Temple) is going to have an important part to play at some point in the unraveling of events.It is no news Tony Scott has mastered the action/suspense genre.

221,paul-kristensen,Unstoppable,8,18 November 2010,"The most eccentric and high powered movie is Unstoppable. The whole time I'm watching it, I was on the edge of my seat. For someone who has a short attention span, the movie kept my focus all the way through the end. The movie is about these train workers that try to stop this unmanned train from tipping chemicals over in Stanton, Pennsylvania. The main character, Will (Pine), helps this retired train worker, Frank (Washington), transport empty cars to a weigh station but on their way, there's a high speeding unmanned train without air brakes heading their way. While trying not to scream, I loved the character Frank. Being a fan of Denzel Washington, I loved his humor that has been distilled and aged just for this movie. Laughing at Frank's jokes and comments, I couldn't stop starring at Will. I wasn't just focused on his looks, but how he comes off as a young guy with a lot to learn and attitude. Trying not to just remember Will from the movie, I do remember Galvin (Dunn). The guy who runs the money and says what goes and what doesn't. He tries to stop the train himself, but when he fails, guess who comes into the picture? Will and Frank. Other than that, you didn't see anyone get run over by the train, but there were some minor injuries and a death of one of Frank's friends.For seeing an action thriller, this one by far, is my favorite. The movie gave me an idea of the life on the train and how strangers or young people, that are replacing you, can help you on a situation that could jeopardize life and death. I would recommend this movie, if you like an action packed movie with two great characters who have the same problem ahead of them on the track.",Unstoppable

224,alerter,"Trains, Denzel and Tony Scott, again? Yeah, but this one's so much better than that dreadful Pelham remake.",7,6 November 2010,"Unstoppable is a pulse-pounding runaway thrill ride with iron-sided save-the-day heroism on display courtesy of Washington, Pine and Dawson.Spoil sports have been grousing that Unstoppable can't possibly be ""inspired by true events."" In fact, the runaway AWVR777 in Unstoppable is based on the real-life CSX8888 (crew) Y11615 incident that took place in 2001.CSX8888 was a single engine pulling 47 cars, 22 of them loaded, for in-yard car switching. The Final Report on the CSX8888 incident is available on the Internet along with other accounts and documentation.All six ""gross errors"" committed by the engineer responsible for CSX8888 are reproduced in Unstoppable, one of them being sugar coated with magic pixie dust, when the engine selector handle auto-magically pops out of ""dynamic brake"" and into ""power"" mode, with the throttle handle set to 8, the maximum setting.The dynamic brake should never have been set during yard operations (gross error #4). Dynamic braking is optimal at speeds >=40MPH and it is ineffective at speeds <10MPH (except on AC locomotives, of which 8888 wasn't).The independent brake of the locomotive was also set, which nullified the alerter switch system, which would have otherwise acted as a circuit breaker to the incorrect selector and throttle settings.All six gross errors really happened and had to be made in the proper sequence in order to result in a powered runaway.Two CSX employees chased CSX8888 in a private vehicle to a grade crossing, because they feared that its engineer had suffered an heart attack at the controls. The engineer had already stepped off the moving train back at the yard (gross error # 3). The CSX employees intercepted CSX8888, but were unable to board it.The runaway CSX8888 did have hazardous cargo on board, variously reported as two cars of molten phenol acid (CNN) or molten sulfur (local Ohio news sources), the latter being less hazardous than the former, although both are toxic. The two hazmat cars were in the middle of the train and they were not considered to be at risk if the train had derailed. The hazmat cars were far enough in, for the surrounding terrain, that they should have remained on the track even if an engine derailment had succeeded.CSX8888 had an average speed of 30-35MPH and may have been going as fast as 47MPH at one point. Four attempts were made at derailing CSX8888, three by diverting it through sidings and one by using a portable derail. CSX8888 dislodged the portable derail and threw it from the tracks. All attempts to derail CSX8888 failed.CSX8888 was eventually stopped by a pursuit locomotive, running in reverse, CSX6462 (crew) Q63615. Avoiding a collision course, CSX6462 had to run in reverse, which blindsided the engineer during right hand turns. That required the conductor to setup at the rear of the locomotive, now the front, so that the conductor could spot for his engineer. The maximum unloaded speed rating for CSX6462 was 30MPH. It had to achieve speeds in excess of 50MPH to catch up with CSX8888. This meant that the conductor's end of CSX6462 swayed 18"" from side-to-side at times. Had CSX6462 derailed, there would have been no way for the conductor to survive. Life and limb were definitely at risk.CSX8888 was stopped without loss of life, limb and/or property.When CSX6462 caught up with the runaway, it coupled from the rear and then the engineer applied CSX6462's dynamic brakes, to slow CSX8888 down, exercising great care not to break the train apart between the two locomotives. Once CSX8888 slowed to less than 11MPH, a prepositioned engineer was able to run alongside, board it and take control of CSX8888, bringing it to an orderly stop.Almost all of these elements are incorporated into the story of Unstoppable, albeit in Tony Scott's ScottFree way. It's reality x2 and all of that's in the service of delivering a ripping yarn. The same people complaining about Unstoppable probably swallowed everything Scott & Co served up in Top Gun without chewing.Unstoppable does make a point of belaboring the fact that the hoses for the air brake system were never connected, but that happens to be SOP for in-yard flat car switching. You can't properly ""kick"" cars if their hoses are still connected. (That's my only beef.) There are plenty of other things that never happened, or couldn't have happened, but none of that matters thanks to the acting talent on board.Denzel Washington's Frank Barnes is a seasoned engineer and 28-year AWVR veteran who never shows any of is his inward concerns, whether they be about job security in downsizing times or worry for his two daughters working their way through college. Denzel's Barnes is all about the j-o-b and doing it right. Chris Pine's Will Colson is relatively new to the ranks of conductors. Rumor in the yard is that Colson's a beneficiary of union boss nepotism. Will's also got domestic problems at home that distract him from the job. This sets up professional tension when Barnes are Colson are paired to crew AWVR1206 for a routine run. Although Barnes has seniority, Colson's technically in charge. Pine & Washington have a lot of tension-cutting fun with this.Rosario Dawson plays Connie Hooper, a rail control supervisor, who has got to plow through considerable BS, not only to find out what's going on with double-engine AWVR777, but also to figure out how best to deal with it, once it's determined that 777 is a fully powered runaway. Even after ""corporate"" cuts Connie out of the CBA/CYA loop, Dawson makes us believe that Connie is going to do the right thing, no matter what.Kevin Corrigan deserves special mention for his turn as FRAMPE Inspector Werner. He convincingly supplies crucial factoids needed to solve the problem of 777, with a Spock-like just-in-time manner. That's Entertainment!",Unstoppable

226,patrickmbrame,"Simple, Thrilling, and Very Entertaining.",9,10 February 2011,"Simple, Thrilling, and Very Entertaining. Unstoppable never tries to be anything more than it is. It follows a runaway train that occurred in Pennsylvania and the two men that try to stop it. First off, I gotta five Tony Scott credit for making a film about trains, that in itself is pretty interesting. How many people know about and use trains regularly? Then take that and turn into one of the most suspenseful, entertaining films of the year culminates into a really good time. The film's opening credits starts with how the train was lost and runs away, so right off the bat you know that it's not going to be a dull film. Before any of the main characters are brought into the story the antagonist and therefore the action get underway. Your then introduced to Will, played by Chris Pine, and Frank, played by Denzel Washington. Will is the rookie conductor that is placed under the veterans Frank's wing. Then you have Connie, played by Rosario Dawson, as the head of all the trains currently running, basically a conductor that oversees all operations, who is in charge of finding a solution to the runaway train, while also dealing with the corporate suits, mainly Oscar Galvin, played by Kevin Dunn, who are more interested in stock prices and money losses then the overall safety and physical damage the train could cause. So, after some failed attempts to stop the train, Denzel comes up with a plan to stop it, and this is where Will and Frank become involved with the runaway.Tony Scott does a pretty good job of making the runaway train look menacing, almost like a monster that no matter what you do always keeps coming for you. The majority of special effects and stunt work were done realistically with very little CGI being used, which for me is always a plus. With it being based on a true story he definitely uses a lot of tactics to make it feel less like a film and more like your actually watching the action happen presently. There's a lot of bird eye shots of the trains making it feel like a news helicopters are shooting it, while also cutting to news broadcasts following the runaway train through the majority of the film creating a more realistic view of the whole story. He also filmed on location in Pennsylvania, which was pretty cool living in central PA and having the opportunity to talk with some of the crew. As for the characters, the first half of the film, is where the majority of the very little character development comes into play. Will and Frank bicker back and forth at each other, when unsurprisingly they find a common bond through broken families with their wives and children. There are also many conversations, which mostly turn into arguments, between Connie and Oscar about how to stop the runaway train and the potential problems it could cause. Yet, due to the pacing and strategic place of key conversations you end up caring about the characters and are pulling for them to get out of this disaster alive. The most important and character revealing dialogue occurs during the more explosion filled scenes with the train. Overall, it's a pretty fun time, and never has a boring moment. Just when you think the dialogue may be getting a bit to breathy and boring, Scott crashes the runaway into some object causing a major explosion. It's one of those no brain activity films that you can just sit back and enjoy. The characters are there and Scott makes sure not to fill the runtime up with too much dialogue, but with just enough to develop Frank, Will, and Connie into people we want to see succeed. Lastly, it doesn't try to be anything more than it is. It's a film about a runaway train and the people trying to stop it, that's it. Unstoppable is a thrilling ride and a guaranteed enjoyable viewing.",Unstoppable
227,movieswithmitch,"It's a bird, it's a plane, no... it's Denzel Washington and director Tony Scott working together on their fifth film!",7,14 November 2010,"Mitch Hansch/ movieswithmitch.com It's a bird, it's a plane, no... it's Denzel Washington and director Tony Scott working together on their fifth film! They need to be faster than a speeding locomotive to save the day this time. Actually, it's a runaway speeding locomotive carrying a horrible toxic cargo that's heading for highly populated disaster. Oh no!!! Worry not good citizens, a bland script with not even enough character development to fill a mini-sized thimble is no match for Scott's visually highly-charged adrenaline train ride extravaganza that is ""Unstoppable"". Tickets please.Seriously folks, if Tony Scott was a horse at the tracks, I would not be betting on him. His track record hasn't shown a decent film since maybe his first collaboration with Washington in ""Crimson Tide"". And their team-up last year for the ""so what"" picture, ""Taking of Pelham 1 2 3"" didn't amount to much so they decided to give the train film another go. Turns out they got this train movie right. With a minimalistic story, Scott stays focused on the escalating danger at hand, using all the tricks in his stylized quick-cutting, slow-to-focus bag. You can figure out the whole film in the first ten minutes but that doesn't end up being a fault due to the so-called inspired by true events tale that Scott tells with action that's big, brash, loud, and always showcasing the power of the runaway train.You want story huh? Well... it's a day like any other day until a railway employee doofus (Ethan Suplee) leaves his moving train to switch the tracks and is unable to get back on the train, leaving train ""777"" unmanned and increasing it's speed up to 80mph. If you can make an effective heart racing action sequence with the portly typecast misfit Ethan Suplee, than you've really accomplished something. On the same track is the 28-year veteran Frank Barnes, played by Denzel Washington, who's always lackadaisical in hazard's way. Barnes is showing the ropes to Will Colson, played by the steely-eyed Chris Pine (better know as the new James T. Kirk). Mini sub-plots of the non-union Barnes losing jobs to the yellow-shirted union, as well as Colson and his spouse's drama are gradually faded out in lieu of the MUST STOP TRAIN portion that overloads and rocks our cerebral cortex.Yardmaster Connie Hooper (Rosario Dawson) gives us all the rest of any exposition needed with her extreme dramatization of this calculus problem. If a runaway train leaves from point A at the speed of death and a rescue train on the same track leaves from point B with a speed of Denzel, how long will it take for awesome to collide? Not long. Tony Scott shoots actions scenes first and sometimes asks questions later. Using close-up shots of the terrorizing train, Scott portrays it as a conscious being that knows the evil it's about to perform, almost growling in the wind. The last hour of ""Unstoppable"" is truly that, unstoppable, making for a white-knuckled thrill ride that plays to our need for heroism and succeeds.

Veteran engineer Frank (Denzel Washington) and rookie conductor Will (Chris Pine) take on the mission of preventing the disaster.As usual of a cinematic course served by Tony Scott, Unstoppable is an intense thriller with gripping suspense from beginning to end. Add to that, the notable chemistry between Denzel Washington and Chris Pine, flavored by Rosario Dawson's performance.

236,blackfirepro,It just keeps going and going and going . . .,7,25 November 2010,"Since the trans-continental railroad was constructed in the 1800s, there have been countless accidents and mishaps in the railroad industry. Some were more severe than others. Of course this is inevitable in any business. Things are bound to go wrong. Once steam locomotives went the way of the dinosaur and were replaced by big monster diesel engines, the railroading business opened itself up to more problems. Unstoppable is the dramatized account of one potentially disastrous problem that took place in mid-Ohio some years ago. The plot of the film (though mostly fictional) goes something like this: It seems that through an unfortunate series of events involving stupidity and bad luck, a monstrous, half-mile long power train carrying tanks of highly toxic and flammable substances was let loose unmanned onto the mainline of a Pennsylvania railroad. The train quickly reached dangerous speeds of up to eighty miles per hour and soon the media, the citizens, and especially railroad personnel realized they had a serious situation on their hands. Out of all this chaos, two railroad workers (played by Washington and Pine) took it upon themselves to track down and stop this monster before it crashed and spread its toxic waste everywhere. Here is the story of the battle to stop this thing.Tony Scott's fast editing / action movie approach to the material is effective to say the least. The pacing of the film is just perfect and although it's not going to win any awards, Unstoppable is a pleasing and suspenseful motion picture that I'm certainly glad I went to see. While this isn't an action film per Se, it certainly puts us on the edge of our seat waiting to see what happens next like any good action film would. In some of the final scenes of the movie I found myself leaning forward in my seat, hoping to God Washington and Pine would pull the rescue off. Now of course I knew what would happen and I'm sure so did you. Even if you didn't watch the news coverage of this disaster you know that if certain things don't happen there would be no point in making the picture. However, this does not harm the film in any way. Although it can't exactly be considered a suspense masterpiece in any way shape or form, the movie effectively creates an appropriate amount of anxiety for us (the audience) to enjoy. Sometimes the movie makes you squirm in some of the more action packed scenes. Not once in this picture did I ever find myself bored or counting ceiling panels. It's an intriguing and dynamic movie that captured my attention and never let it go. Now perhaps it's forgettable to a certain extent, but for the ninety-eight minutes in which this movie inhabited my life, I was interested although not completely immersed in it.Of course this is quite the Hollywood production, full of big stunts and grandiose special effects (praise God this wasn't in 3D!), but I enjoyed it well enough to be happy about it. There wasn't a scene I didn't see coming, but did it matter? Did it lessen my enjoyment of the movie? Not in the least. Now, the story works well and the plot is exciting, but the story filler is typical Hollywood. We never connect with the characters and whether they live or die doesn't really make much of a difference. They just inhabit this world that's only about getting from point A to point B. All of the characters are from the ""character bank"" of the screenwriters' guild. This is the place where all of the generic Hollywood screenwriters go to pick up characters when they can't think of anything new to do. In this movie they picked up Mr. Down-and-Out, Sir I'm Old so I'm Better, Madame Strong Woman, Corporate Imbecile Guy, and the Gilbert Gottfried Character and through them all together to inhabit this screenplay. They don't say anything original or insightful; they just keep the movie alive. But what the movie looses in dull characters and generic dialog, it makes up in great pacing and a wonderful feeling of suspense.Really I think that this movie is just about as good as it could have been. It's a perfect popcorn flick if I ever saw one, but it's still just a popcorn flick. If there could only be one flaw to diagnose this film with it would be found in the source material and the screenplay which is generic, yet fortunately well-paced. Although the movie certainly inhabits the world of ""same old, same old"" stories, it's not off-putting. I liked it. In fact I liked it a lot more than I thought I would. The movie filled its quota, and that's good enough for me. Simply put: this motion picture is a great thrill that won't stick in your mind very long. In fifty years I'll probably not remember three minutes of this movie and it certainly won't be any sort of classic. But as an afternoon of thrilling escapism and Hollywood illusion, the movie succeeds very well. Anyway, I was very pleased with Unstoppable, perhaps more than I should be.www.colewebbharter.com",Unstoppable

It's thrilling, dramatic and mixes just enough developmental elements to make the viewer care about the characters. Denzel, Chris Pine and Rosario Dawson are perfectly cast and help make the experience more enjoyable. Knowing that what happens is based on true life events really brings the story home and elevates this entire film. I had a great time watching every minute of its running time.I usually hate Tony Scott's jarring style but it did NOT distract me at all. Also, IMO the critique of overuse of news footage is way off. I thought they perfectly meshed the footage in to the story. It certainly brought home the impact of the severity of the situation and was a great way to inject information without needless dialogue or other scenes that would've hurt pace.",Unstoppable

244,wsawyer2,A superb thriller !,9,10 May 2021,"This is a movie that engages you from the start, and holds your interest until the end. From a business management perspective, it is worthy of being a required training film. From an accident investigation / analysis perspective, it emphatically outlines the 'accident chain'.Now, it is helpful to have Denzel Washington in the lead role. :) But, that merely enhan ces the movie, it doesn't 'make' it.There is NO gunplay, there is minimal offensive language, there are no sensual sex scenes - which too many movies seem to rely on to be relevant, and appealing. OK, there are actually severaL car chases - but ones that pull you into the film, not just make noise in a nonsensical and completely irrelevant manner, like too many so-called 'action' movies. This is simply a good story, a believeable story, and one which holds your attentiion from start to finish.Watch this film with an open mind - don't get drawn in, or put off by, some of the ancillary nonsense - the police cars, the sirens, etc. Watch it and ask yourself - 'What would I have done?'",Unstoppable

247,pizzazzman2000,Fiction front; Could've been better; Real-life; Commendable,7,4 December 2010,"OK let me spell it out in layman's language.......... When you have a star cast member-cum-hero, he needs to be given the reins in the very beginning.....I don't mean to come across as harsh here, but these are the basic grass-roots of an action flick category in which a star cast like Denzel Washington has been granted room, should have.. I am a bit disappointed on that front, so to speak........ Perhaps if Denzel had been given the drivers seat and been allowed to guide the action and plot in his own connoisseur style, then we would have had a plot which would not only have been unpredictable, but also touched nicely on all the action beats. Too predictable.....right from the very start! The plot picks up speed within the first 25 minutes (I actually looked at my watch, for this!) That is another point where the plot falters..... We could expect, after seeing such an eye-stimulating trailer, that the film would be directed in the manner that we would expect.........the likes of movies like Speed.....where time is more precious than all the wealth we could imagine....where time determines the destiny of many things.....Such factors contribute toward the ""awe"" effect, keeping the audience on the edge of their seats, and wondering who was going to make it, who would not make it..... Unstoppable is nowhere near the genre of Speed ( this is one movie which deserves my heartiest commendation). It fails to drag the general mind under the actual mojo of thrill. Sure there were a few intense mind-gripping moments, like when the train full of kids narrowly avoided a head-on collision with the runaway train, But for movies like speed, which set the genre for edge-of-the-seat movies, I can hardly say that this movie really deserves to be on such ranks. When time, speed, and accuracy play such a pivotal role in the plot, we would expect some nerve-shredding action, with some commendable derring-do from Denzel's character. Sure, in its individuality, we can say that Tony Scott did a commendable job, but a star cast needs to be given full rein as early as possible, to live up to the expectation of all.On the other hand, let's not forget the basic premise: That this is based on a true story or rather, sequence of events. That is where the basic difference between real-life and fiction sets in.......for in fiction, a director is given free play to beef up the plot, create all sorts of chemistry between the cast, create animosity and tension between rivals, and so forth. In real-life, a director like Tony Scott is constrained within the boundaries of what really came out on the front page way back in 2001 ( i'm referring to the CSX 8888), rather than live up to the reputation of the star cast. This film stresses on the fact, that everyday heroes don't need to be persons like Superman, or a person with remarkable ability. In fact, everyday heroes walk among us, and have to risk themselves in the course of their professions. This movie, on that front, scores well...for it clearly shows two common, newly hired railroad workers, struggling with their own personal issues, suddenly take a jump and try to stop a runaway train which could jeopardise the lives of thousands....... This movie revolves around one crucial point, namely, that everyday heroes can be those who work in the most unhealthy, unhygienic circumstances, circumstances which can, at times, lead to danger. Sure it can be hard to really imagine all this as it happens in real life, but Tony Scott does make a commendable effort in generating enough pulsating thrill and action potential, to try and pump up our adrenalin, and make us feel exactly what the people concerned, particularly the two heroes, were going through. In going with the real-life sequence, I find that Scott is able to touch nicely upon several areas ( the common lives of the railroad workers, the disproportionate danger which a simple minor error can cause,the fact that heroes are simply people like us, etc), and giving them all equal importance. On the real-life front, Scott really scores full marks from the beginning of the movie, until its abrupt end.",Unstoppable

249,mrtomclift,"Stupid but entertaining, frenetically made fun",7,13 January 2011,"The sun rises on a train-yard, and there it sits: the most menacing locomotive you have ever seen. Gigantic and painted red, the camera shakes with intimidation. The sound effects roar, almost as if to suggest that the beast is alive. The opening minutes of Tony Scott's Unstoppable are a veritable orgy of establishing information. We cut from the train-yard to young Will Colson (Pine) who is waking up on his couch; trouble with the missus, eh Will? Arriving for his first day at the Allegheny and West Virginia Railroad company, Will is partnered with veteran engineer of twenty-eight year, Frank Barnes (Washington). Frank and the other old timers are gruff, and has little patience for rookies. That being said, he carries around a photo of his two adult daughters, so I suppose he can't be all bad. As the mismatched twosome head out for the day's work, each shot of a new location is accompanied by on screen text, establishing setting.At the train-yard, two hostlers are moving that big red train from earlier. One of them notices that the air-brakes aren't properly tied off, but he decides to deal with that later. After all, who needs breaks? Oh shoot, looks like it got away from them! Probably shouldn't have jumped out to change that switch, am I right? From here, the train (and the film) picks up speed considerably. More establishing shots show us another train full of school children in danger, followed by panicking railway workers trying to figure out what went wrong. Cut back to the train going fast. Close up: man, that is one mean looking engine! Back to the children, still in danger. Now to corporate board-room – can't rely on them to fix things, they're too worried about the bottom line. Back to the train: even faster! Quick, cut to the children – don't forget about them! Now back to the control station. Children again. Fast. Train. Children. Train.Unstoppable isn't quite as stupid as I'm making it sound. It's certainly not as absurd as the trailers make it out to be, cramming every single money shot and emotional outburst into the space of two and a half minutes. If anything, the film could be accused of having a lack of action. Frank and Will's mission to slow down the train really only happens in the last fifteen minutes. The rest of the film is made up of Scott doing everything he can to try and convince us that what we are watching is exciting. The camera spins, zooms, jitters and shakes; characters speak in fast, urgent voices, and the melodramatic score crescendos and blares with every low angle shot of the speeding train. Every few minutes, Scott will show us news bulletins within the film reporting on the ongoing action, constantly reminding us of how dramatic this runaway train really is. FOX news even provide us with helpful 3D diagrams that demonstrate the devastating consequences should it derail.And sue me, but I enjoyed it. From the story to the dialog to Scott's balls to the wall direction, this film is completely over the top in the most effective way possible. Let's face it: this kind of material is perfectly suited for the younger Scott brother. Having previously directed the likes of Top Gun, True Romance, Man on Fire and Déjà Vu, his frenetic filmmaking style is the only reason this film works, even if it is laughable just as often as it is exciting. Indeed, there are moments so stereotypically Tony Scott in this film that he seemed to me as though he was just winking at the camera. The number of fast moving helicopter shots in this film borders on pornographic; likewise, flipping a cop car onto its back in the last ten minutes for absolutely no reason must surely be self-parody at this point. Whatever the case; be it because I enjoyed smiling knowingly at his directorial technique, or because his directorial technique actually works, I thought Unstoppable was a very entertaining film.It does help that the performances are genuinely strong. While their mutual dislike that changes into begrudging respect and then friendship is nothing new, Denzel Washington and Chris Pine have charisma in spades. These are genuinely likable characters they are playing, and while my good will doesn't extend so far that I cared about Will's marital problems or Frank's rocky relationship with his daughters, I'll admit that I bought their on screen chemistry, and that I was rooting for them to succeed. Rosario Dawson is also good as the earnest young yard-master who is forced to contend with the incompetent, money-hoarding train company executives. This is of course where the films ""message"" emerges: it's not the train that's evil, but the corporations! These blue collar workers – young and old, black and white, male and female – they're the real heroes! God bless America! And so on.If it's seems like I'm giving this film a pass, well then maybe it's because I am. Unstoppable is the furthest thing from in the world from intellectual cinema, but as popcorn entertainment (especially coming off what was such an abysmal year for action movies), it is still a hell of a ride. I do think the final sequence could have been cut a little short, simply because there is not much thrilling about watching a train slowly coming to a halt. Oh and yes, they do succeed. I hope I'm not spoiling it for anyone when I say the title of this film was somewhat misleading. Still, you could have found that out for yourself; after all, as the opening titles tell us, this movie is a true story. Or at least, it's based on one. The realistic version of this films climax would have involved someone jogging alongside the train before climbing on-board and switching off the power. Imagine how many cop cars Scott would have to flip to make that seem exciting!",Unstoppable
250,tunnelboy,Unwatchable is more like it,2,24 February 2011,"This would be a PERFECT movie for Mystery Science 3000. 30 seconds into the film I was squirming in my seat from the unrealistic dialog and scenarios. I've totally lost respect for Denzel Washington as an actor appearing in such a piece of trash.From what I can remember of the hard to believe scenes of the film: 1) A young, female, African American is the head yard master. Sure, that's believable.2) A small regional railroad has a yard master building jam packed with jumbo flat panel screens and elaborate hi-tech equipment. Was any research done on this film? 3) Only a passing mention of the ""dead mans"" device in the locomotive? A device that would bring the locomotive to a halt in seconds regardless of whether the loco had its air supply connected to the rest of the train.4) The train making the turn at high speed and lifting off the side of one rail at a sever angle, then plopping right down on the track again. At this point I felt like I was watching an animation.5) News helicopters at a 45 degree angle inches away from the train (on both sides!), going 70 miles an hour. Sure. Happens all the time.6) What on earth did the fact that the daughters working at Hooters have to do with anything in the film? Maybe a little ad placement, eh?

No, it's actually based-on-a-true-story! Will the runaway crash into the train laden with schoolchildren in the first half hour? Will the bit part actor succeed in halting it at minute 45?

Scott is a master of filming fast-moving metal objects but where is the tension supposed to come from when the resolution of each situation is so staggeringly obvious?

From pretty much the beginning of the movie, I knew the basic plot, but still I found myself gripped to my seat, wondering what dramatic plot twist they would add next.

259,mdtscoates,Unstoppable - thank you Hollywood for putting out an action movie that works,7,15 November 2010,"Unstoppable plays out like a basic action thriller that keeps us engaged the entire time. With the train as the center of the story, in a way we get transported back to the days of great entertainment, where the storyline is simple, characters pure, and the dialogue isn't overdone. Here is an action film that stays on track and keeps you glued to the edge of your seat until the high-intensity climax is over. It operates at gut-level mode, as we get to follow all the twists and turns of the main character, runaway train #777. Unstoppable is a summer movie action blockbuster released in a winter spot that doesn't pause for a breath as it picks up steam, and most likely you won't either. It's one of those mindless thrillers that was made so well you probably will miss a lot of the detail as the movie literally sweeps you away, which is what a great action movie will do.Unstoppable is based on a true story that comes out of Ohio where we have a low-level employee who fails to set the air brakes on a train while changing tracks and the issues that ensue as a result. The director Tony Scott, no newcomer to the action genre, sets the stage for the high-octane second half by letting us get to know the 2 main characters: Rookie conductor Will Colson (Chris Pine) and veteran engineer Frank Barnes (Denzel Washington). The two both have their share of family issues, which adds to the difficulty of being able to work together initially. Another dynamic we discover is that the company is forcing employees to be laid off, as evidenced by the fact that Barnes is being replaced by younger engineers such as Colson. The 2 characters provide solid low-key performances and we see the tension that initially exists turn into mutual cooperation to work together for a solution, and then at the end, respect.Solid performance also given by Rosario Dawson, who is both the eye-candy and sounding board for our heroes, planted where she can see all train activity.As the movie progresses, we come to find out that this runaway train laden with toxic chemicals is headed towards heavily populated areas, and our stomach starts to sink about the devastating possibilities that may occur should everything go wrong. The plan? to link up to the phantom engine from the back and pull it the other way, coming to a full stop.It is fascinating to watch the failed attempts to stop the train, which seems to add to the power, giving the audience a realistic idea of how ""unstoppable"" this train truly is with it's 10M pounds of force going full-steam ahead.In the end what we are left with is ordinary men putting on extraordinary acts of courage. Where there might be chest-pounding there are a couple of family guys doing what they felt should have been done by anyone in that situation, and a humbleness that brings a more realistic quality to the movie.I'm glad that the sensationalism was toned down so that the thrills that the movie had to offer truly thrilled me. As others have stated already, Unstoppable is truly a ""Speed"" on tracks and definitely one of the year's finer action movies.7/10 stars",Unstoppable

On the action part, the director has hit the right button, they are full of adrenaline and hard stuff. What makes the movie even more entertaining is that the events are based on true story.

Tony Scott's simple, but effective thriller.A train gets away from a driver in Pennsylvania when he is shunting it in the sidings. What at first appears to be a 'coaster', a train rolling down the tracks under gravity, turns out to be something much more. The air brakes weren't attached and the train is under powerand therefore building up speed.Two men, both with family problems, decide to try and stop the train against orders. Small children are on another train that may end up blown to smithereens by the runaway train.Did I mention that the runaway train was carrying hugely explosive chemicalswell, it is! Enough, in fact, to blow up the whole town it is heading towards. And the town is built beneath a steep turn in the track which will totally derail the train and its explosive chemicals causing a huge chemically explosive Armageddon in the town.Yup, that's about it. But in Tony Scott's hands it is simply great. The train relentlessly powering towards catastrophe and the two hero's doggedly and manfully getting on with the job in hand.We're not bogged down with backstory – there is some family problems thrown in, but this is a film about two men chasing down a runaway train.

This is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.Bad: Cinematography is ""shaky-zoomy,"" distracting and amateurish, making the whole film seem like it was made for television (which is almost a compliment these days). The original score could've been used for any old thriller, really, and was no indicator of the scene any arrangement accompanied. The direction was very simplistic and subsequently childish. Characters were hollow and had very little screen time, showing almost zero emotion and having minimal interaction, in turn stirring no sympathy or support. God awful editing was nearly vomit-inducing, never mind the camera-work. Script/useless banter was typical and detracted from the film. Good: Plot was wonderfully easy to follow and predictable, so it wasn't thrilling and I didn't have to worry about spilling my slushie even once. Used lots of similar shots and really slow movements, mostly the train, so I could be certain that this was a film about a train that seemed to be going fast. I hate it when I don't know if a train movie is about a train, so I'm glad it was on screen for 80% of the film. Seen from the same angles (but variable distance!) every shot. Really good consistency. FOX news was everywhere. Most reliable and nonpartisan news source, so that's a good point, and at one point their logo flashed and took up the entire screen. Scared me so good. I love it when things I love scare me. Also, it was really grainy. And it had some explosions (previewed in the trailers!)! Summary: Speed meets Die Hard, minus the original or captivating elements, any substance, thrills or action.

'Unstoppable' is based on a true story, but the difference is contained in the fact that in real life the train case was solved almost peacefully though not easily, as no one was injured in the process, while the film bravely grants several victims. Indeed, the effect wouldn't be the same, if they had omitted these changes. I liked the movie. Cast played good. Rosario Dawson as Connie performed the part of a lady, who wholeheartedly worries about other people's lives, with great dignity, while Washington and Pine added a desired down-to-earth touch.

Throw in your staple action film characters - a veteran and a rookie each with their own back story, an expert in the control room, a boss who only believes in playing by the rules and worried relatives watching it unfold on the TV screens. It never threatens to deviate from being a mindless, silly piece of a fluff with the script drifting from stereotypical male banter to the cloyingly sentimental in its quieter moments. Scott does an adequate job devising as much adrenaline fuelled action out of one plot strand yet they won't live long in the memory, much like the film itself.Its one advantage is Denzel Washington who even in weaker efforts such as this remains an worthy screen presence.",Unstoppable
266,lundgren9696,"Tony Scott, needs to take lesions on how to make good movies",4,1 April 2011,"For a long time i have been interested in movies, and got inspired by them and other stuff, but of course there is movies that is not good, bad movies and a example ""Unstoppable"" Plot: A train is on the run... with chemicals, are going in a big speed, and is about to blow up a town, and know one can stop it, except for Denzel Washinton And Chris Pine.The plot is easy, nothing special, i did't find the plot special, not even close to special.Tony Scott is of course not a bad directer, he have done some good movies, but more bad, but i stick to his brother Ridley Scott's movies instead, like Gladiator, Alien. I think Tonys best movie could be ""Man on Fire"" and The Taking of Pelham 1.2.3, those movies are good Tony Scott movies, but they others are not good.Like always Denzel Wasington stars in a Tony Scott movie, but he surprise me of his not interesting performance, i were very disappointed at his performance actually, nothing good with it, but then we come to Chris Pine..... Awful, i really meen it, Awful!!! hes performance can maybe classes as one of the worst i have ever seen, and actually i think that hes performance is the one that makes this movie very not good.Of curse this is't the worst, there is something that makes this movie a little bit better and it is the sound effects(Oscar-Nominated for) they are actually impressing, but that is the only thing, otherwise this is a bad movie, and i cant really recommend, but if you like Tony Scotts movies, then you maybe will enjoy it.But in my opinion This is not a good movie 4/10 stars.",Unstoppable
267,samuel-legassick,Tony Scott and Denzel Washington are back with yet another 'thriller' as an unmanned train is running along the tracks. Not exactly Trainspotting...,2,8 November 2010,"Article By: Sam LeGassick Twitter: LG45 <- Please follow! Website: www.thewildbore.com Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Wild-Bore/299067834888Why, oh why, oh why do I even bother going to see a Tony Scott film, they are unbelievably awful. The camera is all over the place, making me feel sick, his focus pulling, sweeping shots, intense close-ups and shaky-cam look unprofessional to say the least. This whole effort to create action through a flimsy script by making the audience feel like they are on a roller-coaster is, in essence, playing on people's stupidity. By drawing their attention away from what matters, it's like dealing with a thick child who has fallen over; he's so taken away with a cuddly toy that he forgets that his knee is bleeding everywhere - and watching this film was definitely painful.The journey to even get this film made was painful. The overrated diva that is Denzel Washington refused to have his $20 million salary cut holding up production. Tony Scott even got his pay cut to $4 million, though God knows who would pay him so much. It's a recession remember? The entire budget for the film was $90 million, so you can see how much of that was spent on Denzel's pulling power. Finally the film got made and is 'inspired by true events'. This statement always makes me laugh. Isn't every creation inspired by true events? Based on true events is something different (and usually a lie in films anyway) but 'inspired' by true events? You could say that about a diary of birdwatching - which would probably be more interesting than this film.In any case, a train is left accelerating by accident without anyone driving it and it's left to Washington and Pine to save the day. Denzel plays his classic 'everyday' hero role that he usually does, especially in Tony Scott films, and Chris Pine tries to keep some integrity in the film by giving off a clearly angry young man on his first day on the job. How unlucky for him then. There's some lacklustre back story which is to fill in the gaps where trains are moving because, as every commuter knows, train journeys are usually very boring. The two bond and it's supposed to show a coming together of generations, and a somewhat meagre attempt at how people are losing their jobs, which Denzel can obviously sympathise with seeing as they were unfairly offering him only $16 million - the cheap bastards, no wonder he was threatening to pull out.They film the train like it's a monster on the rampage when it seems to be going at different speeds from shot to shot. It needs to be stopped before it goes round a rather nasty bend which is inconveniently located above a bunch of fuel tanks and is carrying a load of flammable liquid as well. Not ideal then - who decided to put the train track there? So yeah, they have to stop a train. When I came out, some people were saying how great it was and that it was 'just like that programme 24' - so I guess there's always a market - for idiots - who probably don't watch 24 anyway. I was also annoyed I lost a button on my coat which got caught on the drinks holder as I stood up. That didn't help.There's some explosions and it has Rosario Dawson in it as a dressed down stressed out worker, but she's still hot - and for the ladies Chris Pine has his shirt off at the beginning of the film so maybe watch it for that and then leave. I would rather have not gone and then I'd still have that button. Stop the Unstoppable and just don't watch this film. It's sh*t.",Unstoppable
268,tkaczyk-m,Heroes are where you don't expect them to be,8,16 November 2010,"I find Unstoppable a refreshing movie. It's not about conspiracy theories, aliens or violence. There is no sex, no bullet time, no CGI. It's almost a documentary. And it's all about responsibility. That what drives the movie for the whole ride. The fear of taking it or the courage to face it.Frank (Washington) is a seasoned railway worker who tries to live through another day in his long career alongside an unwelcomed newbie Will (Pine). All they have to do is take their small and unimportant to the world train from one point to another.At the same time a pair of train yard workers send a train on a rampage tour due to their mistakes, laziness and lack of imagination.It's obvious that this half-mile-long load of dangerous materials will face our two main characters somewhere along the way.From that moment on we can observe how the modern world works. We have those responsible who don't have the courage to take responsibility (or at least feel it), those who want to do something but are faced with a wall named greed (of course, the company's executives), the general public, the media.The most logical way of dealing with the situation is put to a stop due to eventual financial consequences with complete disregard to the potential damage to citizens. It's a bit cliché when you watch a movie, but it's completely true when you look outside your own window.It may seem like a obvious movie, but that's it's main value. It's a film about a few minor mistakes which can end up being triggers to a national tragedy and not connected to a accidental launch of a nuke at the Russians.It shows just how much depends on every and each one of us. Your job, your attitude may seem unimportant. But only if you do your job right. If you - a bus driver, a train serviceman or a mechanic, don't take our job seriously, a whole lot of hell might break loose on the rest of people.The movie is fast-paced in the second part, the music keeps you alive in the seat and the lack of CGI makes you feel like watching a documentary. As stated before, there are moments that strongly feel like ""I've seen that a million times before"" and that's true. But not in such a movie. The dialogues might sound cheesy, but they are not.The are not about the heroic commando from the 5th Earth Batallion saying ""I don't give a crap about orders. I will kick that alien scum"". It's about a train conductor making a decision which will probably cost him his job and life for the sake of his close ones. And that's the moment when the cheesy part wears of. It just looks true.Authentic to be exact. That's the movies biggest merit. You feel like that might just happen the next day on the track next to your home. And probably, just probably, the biggest hero might be the quiet one - a simple man who just took responsibility not only for himself, but for some other assholes.So should you - go see this movie responsibly. It will be fun, fast and true. An exception these days.",Unstoppable

270,hltvcomar,Entertaining film... awful directing,5,3 February 2011,"I saw this movie without too much expectation, just to have some fun. The film reached my expectations, but it let me down in other ways. The storyline is a basic-used before one, but it still does it's job for an action movie.Going down to details, the acting is pretty good, and it's expected to be from actors such as Denzel Washington and actresses like Rosario Dawson. The Denzel Washington - Tony Scott combo had worked out pretty well in 'Man on Fire' and it worked again.On the other hand, I just can't figure out Tony Scott's intention with the shooting style. It's just awful. It looks like he tries to add more movement and ""action"" to every shot. The constant zoom in and out and pans are more annoying than enthralling. I almost stopped watching the movie after the first 15 minutes because of this.Still, it ended up being an obvious but entertaining movie to catch on the cable someday. One time see.

271,tubley,Dreadful,1,8 February 2012,"As the son of a train driver I could list at least 10 plausible, simple solutions to the problem of the ""Runaway Train"", that were apparently not considered by the people who produced this film. Had they considered a more logical solution, it would have been a 10 minute movie, and they would have recognized that such a short story would be implausible for mainstream audiences and had to find another subject. Instead, they persisted... tragically.Unable to find anything likable about any of the characters, I found myself barracking for the train itself, hoping that it would rid the world of a few hundred thousand morons. It did not. The train was the ""bad guy"" and it had to be stopped, even if that meant organizing an entire squad of riflemen trying to shoot the train, a veteran soldier from Afghanistan swinging from a rope from a helicopter, and a futile derailment setup that looked as though it was made of plastic.This movie is comparable to the likes of ""2012"" in its ability to brutally offend the eyes, ears and rational sensibility of any viewer with a true appreciation of quality film-making. It is a pitiful indication of the lengths that Hollywood will go to in an attempt to achieve mediocrity.To very existence of this kind of horse sh_t is an insult to train drivers. Hell, it's an insult to trains! Millions of dollars were spent on this impotent garbage, and for what? What did it contribute to the art of film-making? Nothing!

273,Nickilodspiker,Predictable but not bad... actually I enjoyed watching it.,7,2 January 2011,"Unstoppable is another crisis situation movie filled with nonstop action and stars Denzel Washington as an aging train driver Frank and co-star young actor Chris Pine (Star Trek) as his new train conductor. When an unmanned train went loose running out of control and carrying toxic substance that could kill many people as it is heading into a populated towns, the two heroes decided to take actions themselves to stop the impending disaster after a series of attempts to stop the deadly train failed.This type of movie has been done many times since the 80's to 90's I think. Let's see, there is always a person in a command center as guide, the heroes got dramatic back stories for emotional drama, all attempts done by the authorities to solve the crisis failed, a crazy stunt in the climatic scenes... all this cliché stuff are thrown in and I watched a lot of these type of movie before I can tell what's going to happen till the end not unless if they put some crazy twist which they didn't.The good thing is, as predictable as it is, somehow I am still eager to find out what these two guys are going to do to solve the problem. One thing I like also is the updated technique of filming the actions. If this movie is made say during the 80's it couldn't be as thrilling. The editing and the constant camera panning works. Though some might complain about it but not me.I like Denzel and Chris acting a lot specially during the beginning. The friction between the two characters going on while they are disagreeing on many things and the way they trade nasty remarks to each other is actually quite intense. Overall, this movie is not bad and it is thrilling in every way. If you are into some thrill ride of a movie you might like it. However, for those who have seen enough of heroes save the day action movies and all its cliché splendor there might be a chance that you'll get bored or worst hate it.",Unstoppable

275,funkykitten_7,Watching trains has never been so exciting!,9,7 November 2010,"I was really impressed by this film. Before seeing it I had thought of it as Speed but on a train. Now I think it has all the velocity of Speed with the tension and dark humour of the Die Hards, all with a stellar cast, and it definitely stands on its own feet.The characters are great because they are so easy to relate to. These are just ordinary guys, with everyday problems, at work as usual. Even the corner-cutting that starts the whole thing off is something that viewers can - albeit not too easily - forgive, because hasn't everybody cut corners in their job at least once? And the ""top management"" - well, nobody expects that they are going to put logical solutions ahead of checking the bottom line, and they are true to form.But, of course, most of us haven't got an unmanned train carrying toxic material hurtling along at 70 mph to deal with as part of our day job.What makes the characters of Frank and Will so compelling is that they aren't slick, Kevlar-wearing cops but railway engineers, and the fact that they handle an extreme situation with logic, dedication, humour and courage makes them even more heroic.The action is fast-paced, and the tension grabs you from around 10 minutes in and just doesn't let go.

276,vanToom,A well crafted movie,7,14 November 2010,"I read the ""hated it"" reviews on IMDb as well as the ""loved it"" before going into theater and was prepared to find either one of them to be true. I would subscribe to the ""loved it""-party. There's cliché, of course, and the characters bound together in the script are the usual suspects - maybe despite of Connie Hooper (Rosario Dawn), the tough colored inspector. It's interesting to see the rookie Colson (Chris Pine), though a blue collar worker, be much less accepted by the roughnecks in the yard. We never hear anyone complaining about Connie as a colored woman in that position as one would expect. And as shown in one review in detail either, every incident in the movie took place so or likewise in the real disaster the movie depends on. And lets be real: Haven't we seen dozens of catastrophes that man said were absolutely impossible to happen? The last, I think, took place in Mexican Gulf. So just lay back and enjoy the movie which is well crafted by actors and direction as well. I'm not into heavy metal at all, but ""unstoppable"" was good entertainment.",Unstoppable

(Even if its taking of Pelham)Good for all age groups. Near to my seat was a junior sitting with his grandma and both of them were sticked to there seat like everyone else for entire movie duration.There is not much story and emotions in the movie. Disaster starts right in first minute of the movie and continues till last minute. Denzel's presence at all times is good insurance for this movie.,Unstoppable
278,missionbegins2011,The train is the star !!,7,29 November 2010,"Unstoppable in one line is a story of two railway employees trying to stop an out of control unmanned train loaded with explosive chemicals, Thats almost it about the story, It is comparable to a program on discovery channel with the same theme when it comes to storyline but it works in its favor as there are no emotional subplots involved with the heroes families , the movie starts with how a train goes out of control and ends obviously with our heroes stopping it without much damage caused, Denzel washington and chris pine almost spend all their screen time on trains or around them, Although they don't have much to do as the film focuses more on the technical aspect of how the train has to be stopped but still both do justice to their supporting roles as the real star of the movie is the out of control train '777' as they call it, the train has the maximum screen time then anybody else and i must say that tony scott did a great job in portraying the train as a beast on a rampage which is going to destroy anything that tries to stop it, There are moments in the movie where as an audience i was intimidated by the train and its monstrous power showing how helpless human beings can get facing such a artificially created force. Tony scott has a fascination for speed , first it was top gun (airplanes)then days of thunder (race cars) then crimson tide (submarines) and now unstoppable (trains), The movie focuses on high speed drama and is able to entertain throughout without a dull moment although i must say that i have seen better movies featuring trains for eg. under siege 2 but still unstoppable is pretty decent 7 /10",Unstoppable
279,JeffBatHome,"Unstoppable is a great, full throttle action movie! :-)",8,12 November 2010,"The plot of Unstoppable is so entirely stereotypical and predictable that it is hard for me to believe that anything I write here could be a spoiler, but consider the rest of this review a spoiler anyway since I do mention some ""plot"" elements, like how the movie ends in the very next sentence.Our Heroes, of course, have difficulties (on and off their train) but they save the day and prevent a load of highly toxic chemicals from being sprayed all over a city. Then there is the sleek and sexy train dispatcher who is in charge of many grizzled railroad men. So believable. The corporate guys, of course, are only worried about the value of their stock after the train crashes. And the circumstances which led to this fictional train being unmanned but under full power on a main line could only be dreamed up by someone who has worked in Hollywood for way too long. The only thing which is ""unstoppable"" in this movie is the ignorance and the arrogance of the script writers.Speaking as a guy who has studied trains and knows something about how they really work (tho I never have worked in the railroad industry) the script for ""Unstoppable"" is itself a train wreck. According to the Unstoppable Script Writers, just how does an unmanned right train get on the main line under full throttle? Here's how: (1) A stereotypical fat-boy loser yard engineer moves the train without hooking up the brake line between the engines and the cars. This is normal for real railroad switching operations and is believable, tho the brakeman in the movie thinks otherwise.(2) There is a switch track in front of the train which is set the wrong way. Instead of the brakeman doing his job and lining the switch the right way for the train (he is on the radio yelling at the yard engineer) the yard engineer puts the engine into neutral, leaves the throttle set at ""run 8"" (full throttle), and jumps off the moving train to run ahead to line the switch, leaving no one on the train. This too is believable, tho generally against railroad rules, but it leaves the poor audience with our jaws hanging open at the stupidity of it all.(3) While no one is on board, the lever in the engine controlling (What? Forward / Neutral / Reverse? Dynamic brakes / motor? ) pulls a Harry Potter and *FLIPS* *ALL* *BY* *ITSELF* !! ?! The engines, left at run 8, roar to life and the train accelerates. The stereotypical fat-boy loser yard engineer tries to get back on the engine but falls over and does not try again. Of course.(4) The emergency is on. Soon thereafter someone asks the sleek and sexy train dispatcher why the ""dead man switch"" won't stop the train. Without missing a beat she replies that it won't work because the brake line is not hooked up between the engine and the cars. GIVE US A BRAKE! Apparently the script writers felt the audience incapable of understanding the real reason why the ""dead man switch"" failed. A real ""dead man switch"" has a button which the engineer must push every minute or so to prove that he is still alive and paying attention. In real life, failure to push that button within the time allowed throws the engines into ""emergency"", ie full engine brakes, full car brakes, engines effectively OFF, and the train stops. However, in real life, the application of the engine brakes can nullify the dead man switch, and in the incident on which this movie is based, the engineer HAD set the engine brakes, thus disabling the dead man switch. By the time the real engines were stopped, the brake shoes were completely fried.(5) Then there is the bit about the rescue engines sent to slow the runaway crashing and exploding after taking a switch into a siding while the runaway somehow stays on the main line. (There must have been some unemployed ""Gravelings"" left over from the old TV series ""Dead Like Me"" present to throw the switch in the split second between the rescue engines and the runaway.) Unbelievable. Stunningly stupid.(6) And of course the runaway demolishes evil management's second attempt to stop it, half a dozen solid steel ""derailers"", in a shower of sparks. (No movie featuring anything that moves -- bullets, trains, or whatever -- is complete without lots of sparks.) Our runaway also manages to demolish the back end of another freight train (driven by Our Heroes) without derailing. Even a train wreck will not stop our runaway train. Guess it really is Unstoppable.(7) And I won't say anything about helicopters as numerous as a flock of starlings, the train full of school children conveniently also on the main line, or the people lining the tracks every inch of the way, including near the expected crash zone.Having said all that, this is still a FANTASTIC ACTION MOVIE. Two thumbs up from me! I'm going back to see it again. The director of this movies manages to set a feverish pace which just plain grabs you by the gut. Nothing -- NOTHING -- is going to derail HIS movie! By the time the heroes save the day the script writers are forgotten, you are totally spent, and you will cheer for Our Heroes too (and the director)! I had to sit in my car for a while and calm down before I drove home. What a movie! :-) If you like action movies go see this one. Just don't expect to learn anything about the way railroads are run. REAL railroaders know what REALLY happens when a REAL train goes ""on the ground"" and, with RARE exception, they work REALLY hard to avoid that.",Unstoppable

This is so true that Unstoppable conveys an indispensable sense of tension and shows off thrilling sequences of scenes until its final part, when ""surreal events"" start to pop up on the screen. For example, is a normal man able to walk on a high velocity train as if he were running on a simple treadmill? In the movie he is. These inexplicable situations end up terribly decreasing the quality of the plot from the moment in which they start to happen. OK, we have to take in account the fact that the film is based on real facts and producers have the obligation to add fictional elements to keep spectator entertained, but the level of surrealism must be limited!

283,denisvn93-1,A thrilling train ride that you must catch as the year comes to a close,8,18 December 2010,"No longer containing hostages, Tony Scott's second locomotive film gets everybody in a race against time as an unmanned train is carrying chemicals into a city. From the trailers, ""Unstopabble"" sets up its ending before it could start but as a whole, this is a thrilling train ride that you must catch as the year comes to a close.ACTING: Denzel Washington (Frank Barnes) is perhaps in a role too similar to his portrayal in Déjà Vu. To begin with, they are both experienced at what they do and cool enough to say punch lines that can instant-win an argument. But by also characterizing him as a family man and a worker in desperate times, this old train operator is more relatable as he is an everyman in an extraordinary situation rather than being professional from the beginning. Chris Pine (Will) is in the shoes of a revolt youngster once more, working as Frank's co-conductor to pass the time, not realizing how he must steel himself to counter the problems ahead. While Chris may feel right at home, you know, from zero to hero roles, this time around it lacks the 'charmisma oomph' that makes his last role as a rebel in Star Trek so memorable. Supporters Rosario Dawson (Connie) and Kevin Dunn (Galvin) have a mic battle in this one, lashing their thoughts at each other in a match of society vs. corporation. Kevin makes a weak antagonist though as he is not cunning enough to be one while Rosario is spot on with her role as a woman who is having an abnormal day at the office: confused, angered and worried. Other smaller characters like Ned or the troublemakers Dewey plus Gilleece are handled in a very stereotypical way the i.e. beardy and cowboy-attitude Ned = funny man, chubby Dewey = hateful etc. Certainly not the best, but not the worst either.SCRIPT: Having written Live Free or Die Hard, Mark Bomback's name promises a ""resting-is-restricted"" pace with crazy cool scenarios. Despite being grounded to ""trains-only"" set pieces, he delivers both in excellent fashion. That said, there are laughable lines though when it's supposed to be truly serious e.g. ""a missile the size of the Chrysler building"", ""we're going to run this b---h down"". However, the fine delivery from the actors can make them forgivable. True, the ending spells every letter in anti-climactic, but hey, it's still better to stick to the true story rather than ramp it up to 11 so that it borders on the obscene. Here and there will be background stories of the main characters, but they all whoosh by before you could fully absorb them. In other words, Mark leaves no gap for the audience to empathize with the main characters, automatically make them shallow when they clearly have layers for some emotional investment, albeit few.DIRECTION: I, for once, glad that Tony has found a happy medium for his style - a combo between the frenetic (Domino, Man on Fire) and the traditional (Enemy of the State, Spy Games). This hybrid allows dynamic camera movements and hyper editing in the very vein of Tony to co-exist with plot immersion and (omg!) image clarity. When the movie does not go to its main story yet, he takes time to introduce to us the life of conductors, providing much needed introductory base to generate disparities between our main characters. As the film kicks into gear, Tony doesn't stop, keeping the film rolling from one situation to another and each one more interesting and suspenseful than the last. Want evidence? See the sequence when the runaway train enters Stanton Curve. I swear I have crumpled the seat's arm in the theaters. His direction is solid and at the same time brisk, guaranteeing a great time at the movies even when the story has been known ages ago.MUSIC: I'll be honest and declare that Unstoppable's score is weak. It offers nothing unique to the ears, as one would expect from the musician behind Narnia, Déjà Vu, Kingdom of Heaven and Man on Fire. Remember the times when his scores are even more noticeable and memorable than the film itself? It doesn't happen here. With that said, it doesn't derail (forgive the pun) completely though. When the film runs into tender moments, elegant piano notes make their entrance and before you know it, you are already drifted into relax territory. Oh, and here's something unexpected: there are sequences where train sounds are used to create a tune, making the runaway train truly horrifying and a real monster on- screen. Less gravitas as a whole but still sprinkles with goodness here and there.CINEMATOGRAPHY: Ben Seresin wows me with his work in Transformers 2 (but the notion of having to sit through the whole mess to enjoy the photography isO_o) so I'm hoping for the same visual treatment here. It shows. Going hand-in-hand with the energetic editing from Chris Lebenzon, Ben's skills are fully on display with wide shots that show every detail the destruction ensuing on screen or the under-the-train camera placement that truly adds menace to the runaway beast. A noteworthy issue is the rapid swirling whenever our main characters partake in a conversation. Without fail, it distracts me from the conversation and as the film goes on, it gets on my nerves. However, the cool outweighs the ugly in this photography boxing match.VISUAL EFFECTS: There isn't much here! All the magnificent stunts in here are done practically, adding an extra layer of tension to a film that has a lot of it already. Because of the realism injected, Unstoppable distinguishes itself from other action fares in 2010.Even when Unstoppable is a cliché in a beautiful wrapping of all things visual, this tale of heroism makes cinema fun all over again. Get on the train now! From Vietnam, Denisvn93-1",Unstoppable
284,karlcharlotte-1,Slow down. Look out. Here it comes.,7,7 November 2010,"Unstoppable / Rated PG-13 for peril, language and destruction Unstoppable is a runaway train chase movie. Cut to the chase. Not a lot of time spent doing character development other than what the characters talk about once the chase starts. The film is very loosely based on a real life incident that happened in 2001 when a runaway train ran away. 66 miles later the running ended. No injuries or damages. They took the basic idea and ran away with it. Runaway train movies can only end in 1 of a few ways. The train runs its course and stops. Not much to see here. Or it can derail, crash and cause lots of damage. Or it can cause lots of damage but not derail and crash. I can't giveaway what happens but how many people would go to a movie called Stoppable? Denzel Washington (fresh off another train move ""The Taking of Pelham 123"") is the engineer of a train that doesn't runaway. Chris Pine, better known as the new Captain of the Enterprise in the future, is the newbie conductor. Rosario Dawson is the lady in command at the local train center. The original real life story took place in Pennsylvania and much of the film was shot there. When the star of the story, namely train 777 gets moving you best stay out of the way. Moving along at 70 MPH and towing a ½ mile of cars this is one big, fast demon of destruction. For extra jeopardy the train has a number of cars filled with toxic materials. For even more danger the train is heading for Stanton, PA where there awaits an elevated track directly over fuel storage tanks where the train speed limit is 15 MPH. UHOH. Most of the work done by DW and CP is in the cab of a train. Not much they can do there except look worried and learn about each others problems. A few jokes are told to fend off impending doom. The young guy learns a lot from the old guy. Meanwhile old 777 is whipping along and anything that gets in its way gets nuked. At least that's what it looks like. In the works since 2004 Unstoppable has apparently had a few production problems and delays. Many over who was getting the most money. The film is work man like and decently made. The usual scenes of nail biting relatives and friends watching the whole pending disaster unfold are included. There is also elation and cheering whenever any part of the pending doom is defeated by our heroes. Stoppable or Unstoppable. Which film would you go to see? Stop and think. Rated 2.5 out of 4.0 Great Locomotive Chases. Fess Parker version 1956 or Buster Keaton version 1926. Where are these guys when you need them?",Unstoppable
285,ndys-1,During the making of this film...,4,27 December 2010,"I liked this film BUT...I did not like the way security handled the people in the small town of Emporium during the making of this film.Google Unstoppable Emporium, Pa. Go to comments that were written by various people from that town.Emporium is a small town in Pa not close to any big cities. There are no movie stars or celebs that live there. So,when the residents of Emporium found out that a movie was going to be filmed there, naturally it was a pretty big deal... especially knowing that Denzel was going to be there. Residents of all ages came out to watch. Understandably residents watching the filming had to stand a long distance away. It's ironic that part of this movie had to do with a class of children going on a field trip riding on a train, yet when Emporium's children took their camera out to take a few pictures, they were met with very harsh words from security. Fact is, any pictures they would have taken would have been taken from a very far distance from the action. So far in fact, that those in attendance could barely make out what was happening... if at all! Here is a report from the Bradford Era newspaper. Instead of naming a persons name, I have put ""***"".What should have been the most exciting day of their lives turned out to be the most disappointing for a group of high school yearbook students from Cameron County High School on Friday. The students had been promised a behind-the-scenes look at the filming of the feature film ""Unstoppable,"" but the publicist never appeared and the students were left standing in a hot parking lot for hours. Even taking out a small cell phone camera brought down the wrath of security. The students were told to put it away immediately.During filming on Friday morning, Route 120 was closed down on the outskirts of Emporium to allow for scenes to be shot on the railroad tracks. Security was tight and excited fans and on-lookers were kept at a distance for the entire day. ""****"", 17, is a member of the Cameron County High School yearbook who was excited about being near the film. ""We are here to get pictures for the yearbook because we are making a page about it because it is being made in Emporium. We've been here since 10 a.m. They don't really do much when they say they are filming,"" she said. ""I think it's exciting, but it's kind of long and boring. Security is bad, they are meanies,"" said ""****"", editor of the Cameron County High School yearbook said. ""We are kind of upset about that."" ""****"" explained they were invited to the set by a production publicist, but when they arrived, they were told she wasn't available or even on set. ""We even brought her a gift,"" ""****"" said. ""We got all excited for a letdown,"" echoed ""****"", another yearbook staff member. ""It would be fun to watch if I could see it, but you can't get around anywhere."" Another disappointed fan was ""****"", 57. She arrived in her mechanical wheelchair, hoping to snap a few photos for her scrapbook, but security quickly ended that hope. ""To me, Denzel Washington is a star because we go to his movies. We buy his videos and DVDs. If it wasn't for us, the public, where would he be?"" she asked. ""I came down for curiosity just to be able to say 'I saw a few scenes shot' when I do see the movie. I have some relatives in the movie as extras,"" ""****"" said. ""What we thought would be a nice thing to be in Cameron County has turned into a big disappointment. I just think it's a shame."" ""I took a day's vacation from work, so I could witness a little bit of history in the making as Emporium is immortalized in celluloid,"" said ""****"", a lifelong Emporium resident. ""I have only seen two scenes so far and I pulled into the parking lot at 8:55 a.m.,"" he said, explaining that was four hours before he spoke to a reporter.So... I'm not sure if anyone involved in the making of this film will read this, but if they do, PLEASE get your act together and treat people of small towns with decency and respect when they graciously ALLOW you to film there. If it weren't for the people who are fans... you would NOT have a job!",Unstoppable

""Unstoppable"", about a train that is unable to be stopped - big wow. The funniest thing is, there were several attempts to get someone to jump onto the train from a helicopter and failed. Come on, it's not exactly difficult, and that's all it would take to stop the train.Whether it had plenty of decent and well-known actors in it or not, it still wouldn't of made the film any good. The entire ""plot"" was boring. It was about a runaway train that had to be stopped - nothing else, not even a slight sign of romance. Comedy? Definitely not.Dull and boring is what the title should be. Film is stupid and should never of been made.",Unstoppable
288,johnshinnick,A rail yard worker screws up and sends a toxic-tank loaded train on its way without an engineer.,9,19 November 2010,"When I saw the first trailer for Unstoppable, I thought Tony Scott was doing a re-make of Runaway Train, one of the great indie films of all time. In Runaway Train, two escaped prisoners are on the tracks in the Alaskan wilderness in winter. The older film builds tension from the first frame to the last, and it delivers a memorable performance by John Voight with Eric Roberts in his best performance ever (every performance since Runaway Train is a ""lesser babka"").Unstoppable is not a remake of Runaway Train, thank goodness. It should, however, be the benchmark for action thrillers, one of the most cliché-riddled genres in filmdom. The chase scenes in this film are not the endless clichés that inhabit most action films. The explosions are not gratuitous.Unstoppable is based on a true story with fictional heroes dealing with larger-than-life problems. There are a lot of differences between this film and the real incident on which it is based. The real train, for example, was number 8888, while the film train is number 777. The real train went 46 miles per hour, while the fictional train hits a more dramatic 80 mph. The two characters in the film did not exist. The threats to life and limb are more dramatic in the film than they were in real life.Who cares about the differences? When you board this train, it's for the ride, not a history lesson.The film contains only a small bit of gunfire (one part that's true), but the effect is mostly comic. In other words, you don't need guns to engage an audience and tell an action story.A number of on-line reviewers seem to think the special effects are the movie. They miss what is enjoyable about this film.Unstoppable's plot line follows a good, clean script powered by two characters whose personal baggage keeps getting in the way of the job at hand.The film starts with stupidity on the part of a railyard worker (played by Ethan Suplee, Earl's dumb as a bag of hammers brother). Everything cascades from there. In the reports I have read, nobody seems to know precisely how the train got away from the yard without an engineer on board. In the film, the sequence of events is akin to those penguins in one of the early Superman movies. A toy penguin wanders away from a street vendor, causes A, which causes B, which cascades into a major disaster. In this case, a bit of laziness on the part of the worker causes the train to go out of control.The cascading effect leads to a herculean effort on the part of rail and civic authorities to prevent a major disaster of unbelievable proportions. In the real life event, the train was pulling tanks of toxic chemicals and the film doesn't deviate from that. The potential of a toxic spill in a populated area was a real possibility in the actual train incident, but it gets ratcheted up a notch in the film.The character motivation is pure, and the dialogue is sparse. You like rookie conductor, Will Colson (Chris Pine) and grizzled engineer Frank Barnes (Denzel Washington).You look over their shoulders as they face one bizarre problem after another.Layered into the action is the story of Hank's two daughters (two wildcats who work for Hooters) and Will's wife (who has a court order against him).There are no secret agents and there are no bombs. However, lots of stuff blows up ""real good.""The camera work and direction by Tony Scott delivers the scale of railroading to the big screen. These engines are huge and their cargo is heavy beyond belief. The human beings operating the equipment are fragile ants by comparison.This is an action thriller, not a Swedish mood film or a romantic comedy. Unstoppable cuts to the action early and builds to an on-the-edge-of-your-seat third act. It has its clichéd autocrats who stand in the way of the heroes to tell them they're wrong at every stage. It has its smarter than life characters who understand the minute details of diesel propulsion, steel- on-steel friction, hydraulic braking systems, and railroad scheduling.Unstoppable is based on a true story, but when you take a look at the real incident after seeing the film you will realize how much was enhanced to make the action move the film forward. it's about 10 per cent real and 90 per cent fabrication, but that's okay because the experience is so compelling.You will learn a lot more about the operation of a train than you ever wanted to know. You will learn just how hard it is to stop one of these things when they get away from the human operator. But this film isn't an educational docudrama, it's an action.You'll see it for the visceral experience, the 90 minute ride.Take a defibrillator with you.",Unstoppable

I thought without Denzel and Tony, the movie would be less desirable. However, at least the director and the writers didn't have cinema ADHD. The action was intense in much of the movie. I thought the characters were well developed and showed a unique twist throughout the story. Even though this is a well thought up storyline, I feel that the automotive industry is trying to paint a bad light on railways. Since the inception of automobiles, the Automotive industry has used media to tell a very biased opinion. In fact, Railways is a very safe way to travel. It is the most inexpensive mode of transportation on land. However, this was just an annoyance within the storyline but didn't overshadow the importance.

Chris pane's acting was great, but I can't say though it was as good as in Star Trek despite enough character development, may be because I know much about the character of Start Trek than here. The movie had descent start and was engrossing throughout. Action scenes were awesome particularly, the build up of scenes considering the fact we are talking about trains moving on one track here. The great thing about the movie was something was always moving and you could believe it, what else can we ask from an action movie.Director Tony must be applauded for making such a good movie with so few characters.

297,MindGrenade,Ridiculous - Who's in Charge Around Here!!!,5,13 January 2011,"I will make this short and sweet, which is exactly what the movie could have been if anyone with half a brain had been in charge of stopping this train.The acting and direction were adequate, and the movie was not a complete waste of time, but it was just absolutely ridiculous that the train could not be stopped sooner. *Minor Spoiler* There is a scene about 40 minutes in, were they attempt to stop the train by putting a moving train in front of the runaway train and to gently try and bring the speed of the runaway train down by using the brakes of the front train. Now this seems sensible if it weren't for the man dangling from a helicopter who will be lowered onto the roof of the train when the speed drops below 40 miles per hour...HELLOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!! If the front train and the runaway train are touching each other then you could literally walk across from the one train to the other. A 1 year old could have crawled between the 2 trains. There are so many shots of the 2 trains touching that I lost a lot of respect for the movie after this. It was a completely over engineered rescue just for the sake of suspense.

There are several attempts made by the railroad company to stop this monster train. The first one involves slamming a marine on a rope into it from a helicopter while simultaneously slamming it in the front with another train engine which apparently was loaded with nitroglycerin. Surprisingly that doesn't work; the marine falls asleep from boredom and the other engine derails and explodes like the Death Star. Awesome sauce!Next, the police attempt to stop the train by shooting some emergency shut off switch. They abandon that approach as they realize the switch is located mere inches away from the fuel tank, which is pretty much the same thing as TNT rigged self destruct device if the first exploded train engine is anything to go by.Later they try using some sort of portable de-railer which, when hit by the speeding train, launches rockets that immediately target the nearest police cars. Finally they decide the best way to stop it is to have a man with a severe foot injury jump into the train from the back of a speeding hillbilly's pickup truck!

307,moviecriticscorner,It is Unstoppable,8,28 December 2010,"Unstoppable Starring: Denzel Washington, Chris Pine and Rosario Dawson Directed by: Tony Scott Runtime: When a man's life is on the line, there are plenty of things he can do in order to save someone. These are situations where everything depends on one single moment, when you can either live or die depending on every single one of even the smallest of decisions that you make. The bigger problem is when you are responsible not only for your personal life and body, but also for the ones of many others. How many of us are able to actually dive into perilous situations in order to save someone else? What if it was our duty? No, here we are not talking about the notorious firefighters, the police officers or the emergency room specialists which have lives depending on them all the time. The situation is even worse when someone, whose usual work does not include being a hero, has to beat all odds and rescue not only himself, not only himself and his familynot at all he has to safe an entire small village. Unstoppable tells the thrilling story of a train which is out of control, filled with an extremely toxic chemical and most of all – deadly dangerous. Train 777 is about to crash into a neighborhood in Stanton, Pennsylvania. That is, of course, if we don't find a hero to stop it. Denzel Washington plays Frank Barnes, a railway veteran with just a tiny bit of kilometers left in his career before resigning. As a very able locomotive engineer he is able to stop not only a train-gone-wild but also the hyper personality of an apprentice played by an unshaven, but interesting, Chris Pine. Rosario Dawson is in the role of the very nervous and quite impressive supervising dispatcher. And with such an acting, even the overly clichéd script can seem really good. Director Tony Scott, famous for TV works such as Numb3rs, takes another U-turn in his career. Actually, there are plenty of mistakes and misunderstandings when it comes to his work. First of all there is this massively intolerable nauseous feeling which engulfs the viewer and makes them want to grab the seat with all force in order to feel more secure. No, it's not because the movie puts you on the edge of your seat, but of the sea sickness that is simulated by the cameras. There is hardly any moment in this movie which is shot still. The director has chosen that the best way to catch the mood is to let the filming go crazy with ultra fast zoom-ins and zoom-outs, hangings and pullings of the view are also of his favourites. As a whole, even though we have the veteran-actor playing a veteran locomotive engineer in the face of Denzel Washington, we are still uncertain of the real values of Unstoppable.

However, lack of quality screen plays lower the overall quality of the movie.I don't like the plot how the train got loose in the first place. I am sure there are many other better ways to make it more convincing. To make Will (Chris Pine) jumped into the truck driven by Ned (Lew Temple) so that Will could be driven from the coach at the back of the train to the front coach was just too much. To me, it is a cheap plot to make a hero out of Will as well to justify Ned's role of chasing the train in the first place. It is as if there is no other way to get an experience locomotive engineer into the train as well there is nobody who can figure out to drive a vehicle to run parallel with the train so that he can drop an locomotive engineer into the train to take control of the train.However, if you can see beyond the above mentioned, this is still a very entertaining movie.",Unstoppable
312,jeffdalmer,unbelievable rubbish !!,1,18 April 2011,i have never ever seen so much doggy doodoo as I did with this film !! It made me want to go and watch Mama mia or even high skool muzikal my brain began to hurt after 20 minutes - but thinking it was a unrelated migraine coming along I decided to watch another 15 mins before it was clear that the film had induced a brain dead coma.As another reviewer put it - it was one bad cliché after another - an atypical disaster movie in that you could predict every scene and probably write a better script in the process.Why did D Washington sign up to this profanity ? was he strapped for cash? Please please do not waste your hard earned cash on this film - you would be better off paying to have your eyeballs scraped !,Unstoppable

I had to pause this thrill ride to buy pizza. Tony Scott, deftly handles this runaway train, the use of reporters for once wasn't annoying, the two pivotal characters though didn't have enough meat on them, history wise. Just enough for them to bond, and barely enough for us to sympathize with them.

314,rockadoo22,Did they have any railroad technical advisers????,1,28 May 2014,"I am a retired locomotive engineer of 39 years and I have run both passenger trains and freight trains.The things I saw in this movie led me to believe that they had zero technical advisers.At the beginning of the movie,the engineer gets off moving equipment(the locomotive)to throw a switch.However,the switch was lined for him already.How could that not have been caught?Then,during the chase,Denzel Washington keeps referring to the independent brake,but Chris Pine is actually using the automatic brake,another bad error in facts that easily could have been avoided.And,then,Denzel walking on top of a freight train going 60 mph putting hand brakes on would be impossible. It was just one unbelievable thing after another. I guess it makes for excitement,but someone with any knowledge of the railroad,this is a total joke",Unstoppable

I was deciding what flick we were going to watch with my girlfriend, We saw the trailers for Little Fockers, Hereafter and of course for Unstoppable. I wasn't fully convinced about going for this one. Once we got in and the film starts, I realized it was pretty different, decent acting by the entire cast, but what convinced me the most was the story, simple, but great. I thought i was going to see some act of terrorism instead of a simple human mistake. This is fresh!, nice entertainment, and pretty nice camera shots with, of course, the great Tony Scott behind. a 7 out of 10.",Unstoppable
316,drapertron,Solid as a rock.,8,8 November 2010,"So, here we are. Tony Scott and Denzel Washington's latest collaboration is pretty much the definition of high concept - a runaway freight train loaded with thousands of gallons of diesel fuel, eight carriages of a highly toxic chemical and a worryingly curvy track ahead of it, versus two train operatives armed with little in the way of stopping impending disaster bar a one-car locomotive and their vivid imaginations.It's not without its faults, but Unstoppable is a brisk, solidly entertaining thriller from start to finish. Scott has little time for characterisation or back story, preferring instead to kick things off via a pair of laughably incompetent rail yard employees roughly five minutes in, and then letting his leads fill in the blanks as we go along for the ride.Washington and Star Trek's Chris Pine play it straight for the most part - their characters are the reluctant Johnny Everymen found in most films that rely on extended peril for thrills, and they've both nailed the mixture of brooding intensity and occasional comic relief that typifies movies of the genre.Enough about the acting though - when you're watching a film of this nature, you want the action sequences to impress rather than worry too much about the story, and on this front Unstoppable delivers. Scott's track record in the field puts him in the perfect place to deliver the goods, and there's very little of the distracting, overdone camera-work that has plagued his recent output.There's perhaps a little too much ShakyCam for my tastes but for the most part everything is shot with enough scope to be extremely impressive. The near total lack of CGI means the film looks suitably gritty and the pace is utterly, utterly relentless - there's no time to breathe here, just set-piece after set-piece with only brief conversational respites to quickly set up the next danger faced by our blue-collar heroes.This type of film never goes down too well with critics and you can predict the reviews already - yes Unstoppable IS cheesy, it IS forced, it IS derivative and has all the depth of a puddle, but if you want to switch your brain off for 100 minutes and sit back for a magnificently enjoyable slice of escapism, you couldn't do much better. Highly recommended.",Unstoppable

318,c_o_r,Able to make you forget about everything else for 90 minutes.,10,19 August 2012,"This is not necessarily an usual review. It is more like a big personal ""Thank you"" to all the people involved in making this movie.And now I have to explain why: About 7 months ago, my father was suffering from cancer that, in it's terminal stage, ended by affecting also his liver. This meant that he was spending most of the day asleep, and there was virtually no way to keep his attention on something for more than 20-30 minutes. We were trying everything to make him these minutes as enjoyable as we could.And this is when this movie gains a place in my heart forever. I've seen it before, i had a very good opinion about it and, even if this kind of action packed movies were not my father's favorite cup of tea, i thought it may entertain him for a while. If not, he would go to sleep, more or less as expected, and more or less as he was doing it with a lot of movies also when he was feeling OK.For about 90 minutes, my father's attention was on the screen and his main worry appeared to be, more than his illness and more than his pain, would stop that damn train before destroying a whole city? He died 4 days later. That was the last time he was able to stay awake for so long.Obviously, a movie capable of that earns my 10 stars, and my gratitude to Mr. Scott, Mr. Denzel Washington and everyone else involved in it. I don't want to say with this that it has not it's faults, but this is the magic of the film, it was the best option in a certain moment of our family's life.I know, a little bit cheesy, but i felt that i must write this down.",Unstoppable

The dialogue consists of lots of slick train lingo, Pine and Denzel embody the classic ""rookie"" and ""veteran"" roles, and Rosario Dawson spends the entire movie on the phone. Such great talent laid to waste, such a shame. The film itself is basically lots of shots of trains moving fast and the occasional collision... Ooooooh scintillating. In a disaster movie you are supposed to be on edge not knowing if the characters are going to be OK or not like in ""The Road"". I did not feel on edge for even a second, and being it is based on a true story you pretty much know how its going to all end up. All of the classic overused movie clichés are ever present here and if you ask me its hard to accept that such a dull one note movie ever got off the ground.

Who would dare to make a movie on this plot and even if he did how does one ensure not to make a fool out of the movie based on such plot? Well thats the problem...... The movie made me eat all my of my above words because of 3 reasons - Awesome screenplay, direction and denzel washington's acting. This is the most engaging movie yet (Even Avtar had your eyelids going south moments). You ask the reason why this is a masterpiece? Because it proves that you don't need fancy CGI to make a movie. You can do it old school with adrenaline pumping direction and metal screeching action. (Honestly you cant even call it an action movie because no one actually dies in this !!!) .

328,chrisgonzalesclay,Watch The Trailer Its Better,1,13 November 2010,"I went to see this movie thinking this movie will at the very least be fun like being on a roller-coaster. But this movie is so bad it's so putrid I was honestly shocked. Now to be fair I'm a film major so have developed taste for movies. Now after saying that I think the thing that shocked me was Denzel he was just plain bad so was Chris Pine but he's only a small step up from Paul Walker. These characters are just plain boring they are every Hollywood stereotype. Denzel is a widower with daughters who he doesn't talk to or they think little of him or just plain don't like him. But this side plot was dropped because I think either the editor or the director realized how it had really nothing to do with the story or the characters. But the worst part is Chris Pine sure it was fun seeing the pretty boy getting beaten to pieces in Star Trek but in this movie it's almost like the producers ran out of money for a good actor and said ""Ok either Paul Walker or Chris Pine which one?"" then flipped a coin and that's how Chris Pine was hired. He's just so bad he has this real boring way he delivers each line. It makes you either want to punch him in the stomach or just plain vomit or maybe that feeling was the camera work. The film feels like it was shot by a blind camera team. Because none of the shots flow together nothing seems like it works well. Both actors pretend to care about each other but I felt like the actors all had this real feeling of loathing toward each other. But the problem is really the story there is not a single moment where I was scared for the characters or the world they lived in because this is Hollywood nothing bad happens in Hollywood. Seriously Chris Pine's character stubs his tow that is all the carnage in the movie. The movie had a real chance to show the characters in a situation they had zero control over but that feeling is tossed out the window when only two people get hurt trying to stop the train and the only one that gets hurt is Chris Pine. But the thing I hate most about this movie is that it's based on a true story. Let say one thing if I wanted to see a true story. Why would I go to the movies?! True stories are boring because I can read about in the paper or watch it on the news!

The two start the day as normal until news of the unmanned freight train reaches them. The duo find themselves in a head on collision course with the train, and with little time before potential disaster, they have to think fast. Ideal for anyone looking for a mindless, typical action flick but there's on obvious lack of style and gloss here. Washington offers his usual solid performance as Pine takes a back seat in the railway mayhem. The film feels old and worn with an all too familiar systematic approach.

331,mgainglis5,"Washington and Pine's back story was a little lame. Overall though, I'm pleased to report I did very much enjoy this movie.",9,18 November 2010,"Unstoppable is the latest movie to reunite Tony Scott and Denzel Washington in what turns out to be their fifth movie together. The previous outings including Crimson Tide, Man on Fire, Deja Vu and more recently, The Taking of Pelham 123 and as you might notice, they all have a similar formula – action! I'm a big fan of both Tony Scott and Denzel Washington so when I got the chance to see this movie, I was very much looking forward to seeing it.Unstoppable is based on a true story about a runaway train which is unmanned and under power thundering through the towns across Ohio with hazardous chemicals on board and a train load of kids heading straight for it. With the train smashing through everything in it's path, two men (Chris Pine and Denzel Washington) decide to take it upon themselves to try and stop it be devising an ambitious plan that if successful, could stop the train in it's tracks – quite literally! This goes against all their orders from the men in suits back at head office, more interested in saving money and saving face than saving lives. Denzel and Chris do have one allie however in the form of Rosario Dawson who plays Connie, and is in charge of mission control back at the train depot. She's able to help them with the details on where the train is at any given moment and is really well cast in the movie.Let's face it, watching a train pootle along a track at speed for 90 minutes is never going to be that exciting but when Tony Scott adds the multitudes of helicopters, loads of police cars, children on another train in imminent danger and a horse on the track, it's always going to make it that little bit more interesting! He even manages to get an explosion in there in true Tony Scott style! By using loads of close up shots of the characters and the train, it really feels like the train is out of control and you do actually begin to care about what happens to the people involved (can you see I'm still thinking about my Skyline review!). I was never overwhelmed by the chemistry between Pine and Washington and Pine's back story was a little lame. It basically focuses around a messy court case around the access to his daughter and ends in a rather silly fashion where they all live happily ever after by the time the credits roll! I guess it is a film and it had to have this backstory for you to want Pine's character of Will to succeed.Overall though, I'm pleased to report I did very much enjoy this movie. I always think of myself as a very mainstream kind of movie goer. I love all that over hyped over done action genre and Unstoppable is exactly that! Denzel is back on form, running over trains and the sound was excellent, especially in the Fox screening room where the floor shakes when the train comes roaring at you head on! If you're a fan of all things Denzel Washington and Tony Scott, then this one is yet another to add to the collection and I'd definitely buy it on DVD when it's released next year.",Unstoppable

Ethan Suplee (My Name is Earl) was perfect in his role as an incompetent rail-yard worker who caused the runaway train incident. Denzel Washington's character with his 28 year experience as a train engineer was also a good cast, as was his young apprentice. I also enjoyed Rosario Dawson's role and her take charge authority figure as Yard Master. Notwithstanding the locale, the actual incident happened in Ohio in 2001, not in PA, and the director's embellishments, there were nobody hurt or killed in the real story, and the stopping of the runaway train was much less dramatic in real life than as depicted here, but this was still an entertaining train movie. Besides the silly ""SilverStreak,"" the old and new versions of ""The Taking of Pelham 123,"" the only and much, much better train movie I saw is 1985's ""Runaway Train"" with Jon Voight, Eric Roberts, and Rebecca DeMornay that was based on an Akira Kurosawa screenplay.

337,benhlybc,"Gripping, intense, edge of your seat stuff",8,2 April 2011,"The latest film by Tony Scott and starring Denzel Washington is a nail biter that keeps you on the edge of your seat for the full 100 minutes. Based on true events, UNSTOPPABLE is the story of a huge freight train loaded with hazardous cargo trailers stretching half a mile long that begins a runaway journey through Pennsylvania under its own power due to an engineer's negligence. As it builds up speed and threatens to derail in a major town causing a massive disaster, Frank Barnes (Washington), a veteran rail engineer and Will Colson (Pine), a conductor recently out of training, attempt to catch the train and bring it to a stop, with the help of Connie Hooper (Dawson), a rail dispatcher.The film starts by showing Washington and Pine's characters as the typical working class men from opposite ends of the working scale – Barnes is the veteran with all the experience and Colson is the young, newly trained graduate. Colson is assigned to Barnes for that day and they both leave to pick up cargo trailers from a plant. The scenes up to this point highlighted the ""out with the old, in with the new"" dynamic very nicely, with Colson exchanging words with a few of the older generation, including Barnes, who feel threatened by Colson and those like him pushing them out of a job. Barnes also challenges Colson's knowledge at several points creating a tug-of-war for superiority which Barnes wins every time, much to Colson's dismay. The film kicks into high gear when Hooper realises the runaway train is under power and accelerating rapidly. She does everything she can to ensure nothing is in the train's path while her boss (played by Kevin Dunn), puts a plan in place to bring the train to a stop. This plan ultimately fails and causes friction between Hooper and her boss throughout the rest of the movie as she assists Barnes and Colson with their plan to stop the train.The plot as a whole is well-paced and fairly decent, even though not much can go wrong anyway given that it's based on an actual event that took place in Ohio, and never shows any signs of letting up and keeps your attention. Even from their first scene together on screen, I could see the chemistry between Denzel Washington and Chris Pine and knew I wouldn't be disappointed by their performances. The characters they played were unfortunately a bit flat for my liking, but in the grand scheme of things it's not a big concern. Rosario Dawson was also very good at being the ""piggy in the middle"" as she tries to assist Barnes and Colson whilst keeping the corporate guys off their backs. Her scenes also keep the plot moving along and her performance overall was generally good for the supporting role. Overall, UNSTOPPABLE is a thrill-a-minute and was incredibly entertaining, with top class performances from Denzel Washington and Chris Pine, who show throughout this movie that everyone can do their part and be the hero when they're needed.",Unstoppable

The idea is there, the acting is good, and it really does make a good film yet at times it disappoints.As a thriller, the idea of a runaway train gave the writers the ability to make a really intense film, but not always did they. The film was predictable at times, and left me, quite frankly, bored.The emotional connection to the characters was not strong enough, and those put at risk in the film, such as those in towns the train was passing, were not shown, and therefore if the train did crash and kill many people, you wouldn't care.So much more could have been done with this film to make it a lot more exciting, but wasn't.

339,hankriley700-444-566101,Qwik Review,6,30 January 2014,"If you have seen any of Tony Scott's films with Denzel you pretty much knew what to expect going into this film. I was interested to see Unstoppable because there have not been many films where a train takes the part of a character, especially the antagonist. I was also drawn to the film because it advertised as ""Based on True Events"". The film displays an enormous amount of similarities to ""The Taking of Pelham 1,2,3"" from the cinematic style to character development and mood. Yet again we see Denzel as a lead in this action thriller, but for some reason it keeps feeling fresh and new. Maybe the reason for the anticipation is how well Denzel will mesh with younger Chris Pine playing a lead role. The film is set on the railroad in industrial Pennsylvania which works really well with Tony Scott's shadowy cinematic style. We also see lots of booms and helicopter shots with tons of camera pans and zooming thrown in, this makes for an exciting style of storytelling for this action film. Kevin Dunn appears as his usual annoying character you want to swat with a newspaper and Ethan Suplee takes the role of clumsy underachiever who just can't get it right. I will say that the character development is somewhat weak which makes professional actors like Rosario Dawson and Denzel's characters bland. The interactions between Washington and Pine though realistic seem somewhat awkward and especially forced when trying to be 'buddy buddy'. A seemingly simple story line seems almost unrealistic in the Murphy's Law sense of 'anything that can go wrong will'. All in all if your in the mood for an exciting popcorn flick or are somewhat interested in railroad operations you will enjoy this film. If your looking for a deep character driven movie, move along.",Unstoppable
340,paveld78,"How ""dramatizing"" a real event turns it into a nonsense.",4,19 August 2013,"So, some 10 years ago, a train with no-one on board took off and went on a 2 hour ride through the rail network, and catching it and getting it under control was quite a challenge.Pretty good foundation for a movie, right?Yes, but then, the producers decide they want to spice it up a bit, add a little family drama and union bashing and greedy capitalists bashing etc., and suddenly you get a movie where virtually nothing makes sense, technical limitations of trains are ignored, chemical compounds gain properties they do not have in real life, and people risk their lives completely unnecessarily.The real train was going 50 mph, but in Unstoppable, it goes over 75. Not only that, but somehow it is able to accelerate from 60 to 70 in less than 5 seconds (as shown by the speedometers on board), which is physically impossible. Filmmakers decide to add a ""lash-up"" engine in front of the speeding train, yet nobody thinks about simply jumping from this engine to the runaway train, and instead, they decide to lower someone down from a helicopter! A road car with someone who wants to get on-board is chasing the ENGINE, when in fact they might just as well jump onto any of the cars behind and simply climb over to the engine. And, although many trains had to leave the main track to make way for the uncontrollable train, only 1 engine decides to go after it, having to close a gap of over 10 miles, instead of organizing such ""catch up"" chase from some closer location. TV helicopters are showing the car on screen, yet nobody in the entire rail industry is able to calculate its speed by reading time and distance traveled off the screen -- did these people actually finish their high school education??With every subsequent watching of the movie, you will be pulling more and more hair from your head, seeing all the blatant errors the characters are doing.Unstoppable is a thrilling movie, but you must switch off your brain.

There are no modern, irritating clichés such as terrorists, bombs, or the token ""bad guy"" / gang. This film reaches beyond those threats and succeeds at scaring it's audience with something that could become reality in any town, in any state, in any country anywhere in the world at any time, a run-away train.This film features good acting, very good cinematography, excellent editing, and good sound, but works with a questionable script in my opinion.

And even then, when they realised 3 miles before the end of track, it took a pick up truck to run parallel to the train for someone to jump onto the engine at 70mph... WOW!!

But I'll be fair, since I am an ex-railroad employee and someone who has loved and studied railroading all my life. So let's keep the mistakes to what the average Joe should question. Denzel Washington is supposedly a 20 plus year employee of the railroad. But he has to ask how far Stanton is?? When he would have run this route hundreds of times? Why would they have to drop a man from a helicopter when if he had been on Washington's engine he could have just stepped across when they coupled to it? I know a lot of this was to add drama and action, but at least keep it close to being believable. It might be different if this was a sci-fi fantasy but this was supposed to imitate real life.

Once the consist was connected, the engineer could have just applied the dynamic, and stepped off the back of the rear engine, onto 777.

It was clear that there's a walkway that would have made it dead easy to simply jump from the front engine to the other one and just walk in and shut it down. Engines always have these walkways to allow the operators to walk from one engine to the other. But of course that wouldn't have left any premise for a movie.

Stupid because every element of the train runaway and chase was removed from the real world of trains. Even someone that knows little about the railroad should see this. The most glaring example was the attempt to stop the train with the pair of engines out in front. This engineer slowed until he was into the runaway train and then instead of staying against it, kept pulling away and then slamming back against it.

I don't want to give away to much spoilers but if you have seen the trailer you've seen about all of the movie. It's a chase scene that lasts far too long. There is a scene where Densil tries to jump a gap whilst the train is going at high speed, he backs off... That's exactly the tone of this film. All hype but nothing to back it up. The plot is terrible, the movie takes itself far to seriously and the action-scenes barely makes any sense. I'd only recommend you seeing this if you're so stressed you'd like to see a mind numbing movie.Why this movie has received a 7 star rating is beyond me.

It's such a gripping movie, every second of the movie keeps u so much thrilled, exciting and what else it was just awesome.I like tony Scott, the man's a genius. I was hoping the movie to be just an above average one (as trains didn't do much good to Scott, the taking of Pelham 123). The movie begins very silently, i mean its like Chris pine's wakes up and goes to see his wife who's been avoiding him, it starts with a normal story but that's just 10 minutes of the movie, once he gets to the yard, the fun begins. Chris Pine's a fine actor but i didn't actually like him as a guy for the action movies(though star trek was remarkable) , but i was completely wrong, he's my new favorite now, he's the man. Denzel Washington, u know this guy, u put him in anyone's shoes, he makes us believe that those are his own shoes. As a favorite leading man of tony Scott, denzel never lets his directors trust on him down. He was just awesome. There are quiet few things dat Scott usually does, like u say "" why da heck does he need this here,whats wrong"". In this movie Denzel Washington's two daughters work for The HOOTERS. Actually this is something that is not needed.Anyways this doesn't spoil the fun people, u are gonna take a hell of a ride watching unstoppable.

And talking about Rosario Dawson, she was the best choice for the role, she justifies her role and was some fine acting is delivered from her.The final thing is that, u are gonna love this movie and the way it was presented and the sense of good editing makes u feel happy at the end, i didn't tell u people the story cause it'll spoil the fun for u, watch it to experience it.

This movie tried very hard to be constantly climatic, and was interesting, however the movie tried very hard to involve the viewer with the characters and their relationships in a drematic way, and this interrupted the action frequently.... so what you get is a halfway action, thriller, and drama movie.

At the beginning of the workday multiple errors are made by two employees to cause a runaway train. The film is based on attempt to stop this runaway train before it hits a highly populated town and causes large amounts of damage.The film progresses as smoothly as it could. We are told at the beginning that this is based on true events, which makes the film more chilling at the start. Initially, I expected this film to begin as other thrillers have been with beginning plot fillers to take up time from the suspenseful aspects of the film, thankfully this wasn't the case.I hate to use the cliché phrase: ""it kept me on the edge of my seat,"" but it surely did. There are always speed bumps (no pun intended) that follow the film throughout to the last minutes. The audience is left guessing, but not questioning the possibility of the action shown on screen. The film also shows a progression of respect for the age difference between the two workers. Each character has the opportunity to learn from each other throughout the film, that being a rookie and a near retiree. This was a great aspect to include in the plot. Overall, this film is fantastic and worth viewing. I'm not sure if I am biased by enjoying similar films like ""Phone Booth,"" ""Collateral"" or ""Cellular"" with concepts that consume the entire plot, but this is highly recommended.

In my profession I've been running freight trains for 10 years so I was reluctant to go see ""a movie about work"". But I'll say that I was pleasantly surprised at the accuracy of the railroading operations (and personalities) for the most part. The ending was a little Hollywood and far fetched, but ""this is Hollywood"" and they have to give it some sensation. As for a train staying powered like in the movie, bull; it could however be pushed downgrade by a heavy train. The human element of the crew camaraderie was excellent, and that opening scene where the rookie reports to the crew room was exactly like my first day on the railroad; I told my wife ""that is exactly what it is like.""

Tony Scott has certainly put out some CRAP i.e. Taking of Phlem, Days of Thunder,Domino, Top Gun. He has also made two of my favorite movies, True Romance and Man on Fire. Plus some pretty decent pictures like Enemy of the State and Revenge. Beginning with Crimson Tide in 95' he and Denzel have made five movies together. As I said I am a HUGE Man on Fire fan but the last two they have made together have really sucked. The last Denzel/Scott outing, The Taking of Pelham 123 was total garbage. So I was not the least bit interested in letting Tony Scott bore and annoy me with another movie about a fraking train. That said I figured at least this one didn't have that religious nut sack Vinnie Barbarino in it so when I saw it at the dollar DVD kiosk at Safeway on a rainy Monday I said eff it and.... Holy sh!t! It is actually pretty good. Now let me say, this movie is not original, intelligent, or unique in any way shape or form. But let me also say that I think sometimes that's OK. If you are the type of highbrow as$hole who can't suspend disbelief for an hour and a half then not only must you kinda suck to be around, but I kinda feel bad for you. Is it believable? Not in the least. Unstoppable is about a train that is unstoppable and needs to be stopped. Denzel is the man for the job and we all know he is gonna handle that sh!t. So why did I say this movie surprised me? Because Scott didn't screw up a simple premise and just made a straight forward action/thriller and it seems a lot of movies lately can't decide what they want to be or what story they want to tell. Complex storytelling will always have it's place but its nice to see a movie that knows what it is from the start and sticks with that.

The biggest complaint I have about the movie is the complete overuse of the helicopters in almost every shot. The helicopters became like gnats or flies, popping up everywhere, seeming to be flying beside the train, even - below the train. It was as if the film's creator had paid an exorbitant fee for the use of the helicopters, could not get a refund, so was hell-bent on making sure they appeared throughout the movie, even in places they should not have appeared, including the closing scenes. I watched this movie late at night, then dreamed about the gnat-like helicopters all night. Otherwise, the story line beneath the plot to stop the runaway train - seemed weak and contrived.

This movie is my favorite thriller of my life so far. If you love any of the words I said in the title, you'll love this movie. The action and SUSPENSE of this movie when you see it for the first time, you are on the edge of your seat, right down to the final minute. I must say, the special affects of this movie should have won an award. But why I gave this a 9? The camera work was not that great. SO MUCH zooming in and out at unnecessary times! If you can get past this, you will enjoy this movie. The acting was good overall and the action scenes were timed perfectly. There are a few cuss words said and there is a shot or two that could be graphic to young views as well, but they don't define this movie. I suggest anyone see this movie if they have seen the Taking of Pelham 123 or Man on a Ledge, because the amount of awesomeness that occurred in those movies occurs in this one.Based on my words, stop reading and watch this epic movie!",Unstoppable
377,tuncerd,An ordinary movie,4,29 January 2011,"When I was watching this movie, I wanted to be able to change the TV channel and scan if there was anything better to watch. Because it felt like I was watching a reality show/movie on Discovery Channel. Denzel Washington is really convincing with the role. But it doesn't make any difference since the other characters feels empty and sketchy. It seems like the screenwriters wanted you to like the characters by giving the backgrounds of them, but it feels really artificial. So I didn't even care. When I saw that the movie was nominated for Oscar, I was confused. Then I realized that it was for sound editing. OK, the sounds were great but still it doesn't enough to make this movie worth watching.That's all.",Unstoppable

379,genxor,This film was flawed but enjoyable,5,7 August 2015,"This is my first review so go easy on me. BTW it contains spoilers! This movie was alright, lots of action and lots of train. Lots of Denzel looking like he's the coolest dude around - as he does. The young guy in the train with him was pretty good too, like he could be in other action movies no problem. It even has the guy from Mallrats who couldn't see the sailboat. He lost a lot of weight which is good for him and his cardiovascular system.I really enjoyed it and despite what others say about the camera work I didn't find it too jarring. Was a great way to shoot an action film.The big BIG problem I have though is the title. There's a huge discrepancy there. Why? Because the train stops. It isn't unstoppable if it stops - that makes it stoppable.",Unstoppable
380,asterixjunk,Best action/disaster movie in ages,10,6 November 2010,"From the trailers I thought this would be a cheesy action/disaster movie that was unbelievable and bad, but maybe so bad it was good.What I got was a fantastic, fast paced, very believable, thrilling movie with great acting. Can't say enough praise, this is a roller coaster ride that is nonstop action. While I am sure much has been exaggerated from the 'true story' this is based on (read another review for good detail on that) never did something happen that was so unbelievable that I had to totally suspend belief. The casting and acting is top notch, everyone is perfect for their role. The characters are all excellent, even the 'bad guy' (corporate) isn't overdone, he acts as a corporate manager probably would given the situation.All I can say is that if you like action or disaster movies (though I'm not sure if this is really a 'disaster' movie) just see it.",Unstoppable

382,Patiened,"Very dissapointing, safe to skip this one",3,30 April 2018,"I really like Denzel Washington so I was checking out what movie of his should I watch next. Stumbled across this one, saw high ratings and decided to give it a try.
I expected interesting characters because the story sounded and is extremely predictable but I was very underwhelmed.
I'm not mad at the plot because you can't really make it interesting, it's just a train... but more effort could've been put in the characters, they felt way too bland.",Unstoppable

384,anir-dast,"Exceptional , masterpiece",10,12 November 2010,"Heard a lot about this movie. So finally, had a great dinner and then went to watch the movie. Always knew that Denzel Washington chooses his movie very carefully. I have seldom written reviews for movies because they are not worth writing. Either the screenplay,or the cinematography, or the direction is bad. I just came out the second last show and i have been compelled to write the review for this movie. Three words can define the movie really well : excellent, masterpiece, and engrossing. The direction is just flawless. Performance wise, Denzel and the other actor has done a great job. Whoever is the cameraman, has also done a fabulous job. Hats off to him. Lot of credit has to go to Tony Scott for his effortless and excellent direction. The screenplay was excellent and you could easily the movie had a solid script before the filming started. I would encourage to go and watch the movie at least once. You won't be disappointed. I have just started working so i don't have a whole lot of money. However, i am going to catch the movie in the dollar theater and when the movie comes out in DVD, i might just gift myself a copy of the movie. Everyone out there...Enjoy the movie.",Unstoppable
385,ejl7-1,Good Time Spent,8,25 November 2010,"I liked the actors and I have always enjoyed great shots of massive trains and this movie met my expectations.Were their some items that I thought questionable as far as realism goes? Yes, and especially after reading some expert railroad comments on braking and back up systems. But, not overdone and no detraction for me.I knew Denzel would carry his part well. I was pleased at how Chris Pine portrayed his character.I liked the fact that the characters, when facing dire consequences turn to those that mean the most in their lives. No false heroics for me. Watched it. Liked it.",Unstoppable
