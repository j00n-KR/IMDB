0,SnoopyStyle,A Rock and Roll Fable,7,23 January 2016,"Ellen Aim (Diane Lane) is the lead singer of Ellen Aim and the Attackers. While performing a concert, she's kidnapped right off the stage by Raven (Willem Dafoe) and his motorcycle gang which has been harassing the neighborhood. Reva asks her brother Tom Cody (Michael Paré) to come home and rescue his ex-girlfriend. He befriends tomboy mechanic McCoy (Amy Madigan). They are hired by Ellen's manager and boyfriend Billy Fish (Rick Moranis).I like the neon-colored Rock-and-Roll alternate-universe 50s era. It's weirdly energetic and compelling. Sexy Diane Lane starts it off with a rock performance. This reminds me of Walter Hill's other fable The Warriors except I like this more. Michael Paré used to be leading man material for about two seconds around this time. His masculine ruggedness fits this material. This doesn't work if one takes this too seriously. It's fun like a comic book movie.",Streets of Fire
1,boblipton,"Unfortunately, They Didn't Toss the Camera Negative Into The Streets Of Fire",1,30 April 2019,"After the success of 48 HOURS, producer Joel Silver put together this movie using the same writer and director and I certainly hope this is the worst movie that Walter Hill has or will direct. Michael Pare is hired by Rick Moranis to rescue his girl friend, Diane Lane, from a motorcycle gang led by psychotic Willem Dafoe and recruits ex-army Amy Madigan to help. Not one of these illogical, paper-thin characters can speak an overwritten line without sounding like they just want to get through the scene as fast as possible.Apparently Walter Hill didn't want to leave California, so they built a Chicago in Hollywood, then sent a second unit to the Windy City, taking particular care that nothing matched. Other actors whose careers survived this turkey include Bill Paxton, Robert Townsend, Mykelti Williamson, Lynn Thigpen, and Ed Begley Jr.",Streets of Fire
2,claudio_carvalho,A Stylish Homage to Rock & Roll,7,21 April 2008,"When the successful rock and roll singer Ellen Aim (Diane Lane) is kidnapped by Raven Shaddock (Willem Dafoe) and his motorcycle gang The Bombers during a concert, the fan and owner of a bar Reva Cody (Deboran Van Valkenburgh) writes a telegram to her brother and Ellen's ex-boyfriend Tom Cody (Michael Paré) asking him to return to Richmond. Tom meets the former soldier McCoy (Amy Madigan) in town seeking for job and they are hired by Ellen's manager and boyfriend Billy Fish (Rick Moranis) to rescue Ellen. Tom, McCoy and Billy travel in a car in a journey to the Battery, burning down the streets of the dangerous neighborhood.The cult ""Streets of Fire"" is a stylish homage to rock & roll. This movie has a awesome soundtrack with many wonderful songs of Ry Cooder and charming characters performed by the sexy Diane Lane; the annoying Rick Moranis; the funny Amy Madigan; the great villain Willem Dafoe; and the troublemaker ""good guy"" Michael Paré. In the end, this underrated movie is a great entertainment. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Ruas de Fogo"" (""Streets of Fire"")",Streets of Fire
3,kosmasp,Flawed and rough gem,8,25 September 2019,"I only got to watch this recently in a really good movie theatre in London (Prince Charles). They had the analog ""copy"" of the movie and it had all those flaws you have or had back in the day when movies where shown from film reels. But those are not the flaws I was talking about.No the movie has some issues story wise, the main character is quite the rascal and there are many other (even smaller things) you can take issue with. But if you do that, you will rob yourself of a lot of fun. Because Rick Moranis is quite the discovery in this one. I guess discovery may be a bit of a big word (Ghostbusters, Little shop of horrors and many more), but he really helps with the fun factor and the entertaining.Old school with a lot of machismo going around and a lot of things you will be offended by ... if you are easily offended and if you don't take into account when this was made ...",Streets of Fire
4,gavin6942,A Culty Cult Movie,6,9 May 2017,"A mercenary (Michael Pare) is hired to rescue his ex-girlfriend (Diane Lane), a singer who has been kidnapped by a motorcycle gang.This film has the word ""cult"" stamped all over it. Set in ""another time, another place""... which is basically the 1980s mixed with the 1950s, with stranger outfits and hair. I mean, really, what is going on with Willem Dafoe's wardrobe -- he looks like a fisherman who got a makeover at a gay bar.The film excels in many ways, with good music and many stars at the beginning of their career, including Dafoe and Bill Paxton. Michael Pare was probably peaking around this time, with all due respect to him. And then Rick Moranis... he probably gets more screen time here than anywhere outside of the ""Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"" franchise.",Streets of Fire
5,ma-cortes,Wonderful adventure in comic-book style with attractive images and pulsating rock soundtrack,7,5 September 2015,"Enjoyable urban/modern Western combined with rock 'n roll , displaying a satisfying and impressive directorial by Walter Hill . It is an entertaining compendium of noisy action , rock music , a love story , sadistic as well as violent bikers , fights , state-of-the-art frames and many other surprising things . A famous female rock singer called Ellen Aim (Diane Lane) is captured by a motorcycle gang led by Raven (Willem Dafoe) . As an embittered mercenary named Tom Cody (Michael Pare) goes after his ex-Sweetheart who has been kidnapped by the cruel band .It's a diverting action/thriller/musical with adventures , non-stop action , shootouts , breathtaking scenarios ; but also melancholy , friendship , unlovable camaraderie , emotionalism and including marvelous songs . Gorgeous scenarios set to rocking backbeat , mostly in sumptuous interiors , reflecting wonderfully the luminous spaces filled with neon lights , they are splendidly photographed by excellent cameraman Andrew Laszlo , and mainly on a soundstage . It is an enjoyable storytelling set in a mythic world that combines a futuristic feel with 1950s styles and attitudes . Impressive and evocative musical score by Ry Cooder , Hill's ordinary musician , adding catching songs . Nice acting by Michael Pare as two-fisted hero , a former boyfriend who sets out to save his ex-girlfriend , an enticing female rock star well played by Diane Lane . Stunning support cast , plenty of familiar faces such as Rick Moranis , Deborah Van Valkenburgh , Richard Lawson , Rick Rossovich , Bill Paxton , Robert Townsend , Mykelti Williamson , Elizabeth Daily , John Dennis Johnston , Stoney Jackson , Lee Ving , Peter Jason , Ed Begley Jr , among others . And special mention for Amy Madigan , a tomboy playing a tough warrior woman who helps starring to take on the nasty biker finely performed by Williem Dafoe .This stylized retelling was very well directed by Walter Hill , a Western expert , such as he proved in ¨Will Bill¨ and ¨Long riders¨ . Hill's skillful direction is assured and firm and occasionally quite inspired . Director Walter Hill gets too much experience on western genre , thus : ¨The long riders¨ , ¨Will Bill¨ , ¨Geronimo¨, and ""Broken Trail"". Besides , he has directed modern westerns such as ¨Streets of fire¨ , ¨Extreme prejudice¨ and ¨Last man standing¨. His best Western called ¨Geronimo¨ was followed , by his biggest hit to date, ¨ 48 hours¨ and with a sequel¨ Another 48 hours¨ . Since then, his movies have not made huge amounts at the box-office, though the best of them ¨ Streets of fire¨ retains a certain primitive drive strangely to be found elsewhere . Rating : Better than average and well worth watching for the proficient film-making . It's a magnificent movie , and an unforgettable , unchallenged classic modern flick.",Streets of Fire
6,moonspinner55,It's all dry-ice smoke and mirrors,5,30 November 2003,"Send-up of 1950s rock-and-roll flicks has a slicker look and a far bigger budget than those ever did, however the plot is just as slight: tough drifter attempts to rescue ex-girlfriend/gorgeous rock singer from the sneering leader of a motorcycle gang. Full of intentionally campy dialogue, fun supporting performances by Rick Moranis and Amy Madigan, but not much going on emotionally at its core. Michael Pare and Diane Lane are very pretty yet very placid, and the Meatloaf sound-alikes on the soundtracks don't give the musical numbers the lift they need. Lots of noir-ish neon and wet streets, but little fire. ** from ****",Streets of Fire
7,Quinoa1984,"a dynamic rush of rock & roll, pulp comic book filmmaking, but...",7,27 May 2016,"How do I describe this movie? It's kind of like Walter Hill made his own Sin City in the early/mid 80's, but also as a rock and roll (semi) musical with throwbacks to the 1950's while at the same time still being very, very 80's. Those throwbacks are in the music somewhat too via a score by Ry Cooder (and keep in mind this was the same year he also scored Paris, Texas, just think about the versatility for that), and of course with the biker imagery and rockabilly aesthetic. And the movie has quite the cast - Diane Lane as a Pat Benatar-ish singer in one of her early roles; Rick Moranis as the jerkish manager (and Lane's character's boyfriend, for reasons); Willem Dafoe as... hell, it's Williem Dafoe as a villain in the 80's, isn't it a full price ticket already? I think the strongest thing about this is Hill's vision as a director. This is clearly a personal movie for him, though it also acts as like the B-side to the A-side of The Warriors: that movie was better put together and more cohesive (the mission at the core was something to follow easier as it was over a night), but they both come from the same wild comic book look and feel. The locations this is set in (somewhat in Chicago and somewhat in Los Angeles) are designed to be in the past and the future, but it's to the point where you can't distinguish one from the other. That's good, and it makes it into this wonderful alternate reality where pop culture tropes, from the diner to the rock club to the down and dirty biker bar with the Zoot-Suit-Riot type of dance to the way everyone dresses, it makes for a visually unique spectacle. Oh, and Hill is solid here at directing action and violence, which you'd expect coming from the 79 movie and others he's done.Even the star, Michael Pare as Tom Cody(and don't worry you won't forget that name the number of times its said, first and last name), feels like he's ripped from the pages not from comics of the 80's (though maybe there's some Frank Miller scraped off on him unintentionally) but from a pulp comic from the *50's*. So when he has Pare act the way he does here - often with stoic looks and without really doing much in the way of, you know, anything but declarative statements and orders - I kind of like it because it fits the feel of the whole place. Is it the *best* actor that could've been in the role? No, but he does the best with it that he can.Where it falters is in portions of the script. The first half has a clear trajectory because it involves Tom Cody getting a message from his sister to come back to save his ex-girlfriend (Lane's Ellen Aim) from the clutches of the biker Dafoe and his gang to his hometown (he's been away at the army following, I suppose in this world, juvenile delinquency). This part is fun and engaging, albeit with Moranis committing to a role that's obnoxious, and I'm not sure if it's his performance or the character. But once this mission is done the movie kind of flounders on what we can expect to happen: the Dafoe biker will come back to get the girl (and Dafoe is maybe the best part of the movie to be fair so any screen time he gets is welcome), and that Pare and Lane will bicker back and forth with Moranis in the middle. Indeed a lot of the dialog the characters get to say, even Amy Madigan in a well acted tough guy role given to a woman (a nice decision on Hill's part), is rather nasty and just full of mean spirit.Does that make the movie bad? Not all of it, but Streets of Fire is an experience that ends up waxing and waning for me, to the point where in the second half I wondered if it was a *good* movie or more of a guilty pleasure trip into a Hollywood director's headspace where he practically had carte-blanche (post 48 Hours). And along with the flaws in the story there's a reliance on ridiculously fast editing to the point where you realize this is what critics meant at the time when they went after movies with ""MTV style editing"". And Hill and his editor have a lot of good decisions here, but the montages make it dated in such a way that I was reminded of Purple Rain from the same year, only FASTER!With all this said, I did have fun with Streets of Fire, from Cooder's fantastic score to the performances that worked to the emotional finale that just reaches out and doesn't give a flying f*** about what you think of it going into camp. The logical part of my brain can pick it apart till the cows come home, but as far as it being an experience to soak in all of the full on CINEMATIC tropes it works.",Streets of Fire
8,tavm,"Having missed this movie so many years ago, I'm so glad I finally watched Streets of Fire",9,22 July 2010,"After about 25 years, I finally watched this underrated Walter Hill film that not only had several action sequences but also a few complete musical performances that just blew my breath away. I mean, seeing Diane Lane in the opening and closing numbers were some of the most awesome scenes in this movie. By the way, that's not her singing but that of Holly Sherwood. Another singer, Laurie Sargent, also dubs her in another musical segment. Her, I remember from the video ""10-9-8"" with her group Face to Face, who portray Lane's group The Attackers, whenever it showed on the TBS weekend late night music video compilation show ""Night Tracks"" during the '80s. Anyway, Michael Pare plays the antihero lead Tom Cody who agrees to rescue former flame Ellen Aim (Ms. Lane's character) from the clutches of Raven Shaddock (Willem Dafoe) for a price. Rick Moranis-as Aim's manager Billy Fish-agrees to provide the dough while Amy Madigan-as the tough-as-nails McCoy-tags along. Along the way, we meet Cody's sister Reva (Deborah Van Valkenburgh), Clyde the Bartender (Bill Paxton), Bill Gunn-the guy who reveals where Ellen and Raven are (Ed Begley, Jr.), Greer-one of the members of Shaddock's gang: The Bombers (Lee Ving), and the musical group The Sorels of which two of those members are B.J. (Mykelti Willimson) and Lester (Robert Townsend). I'll stop there and just mention that I found the whole thing awesome with the look of the picture especially when they showed those subway trains that I actually rode on when I briefly went back to my birthtown of Chicago, Ill. as a 10-year-old kid in the summer of 1977. And most of the dialogue-courtesy of Hill and Larry Gross-just cackles with atmosphere, especially when Pare, Madigan, and especially Moranis put in their two cents as their characters. In fact, this is quite a departure for the latter as he usually is more comically nerdy compared to the more straight character he plays here though he gets some point-on wisecracks. And all the songs are just so great especially when they're written by such luminaries as Lieber & Stoller, Stevie Nicks, and Jim Steinman. And what about that score by Ry Cooder with some help by Jimmy Iovine! In summation, Streets of Fire was just such a cool movie to watch so that's a high recommendation. P.S. One of those great songs was ""I Can Dream About You"" which The Sorels lip-synced to Winston Ford's vocals though the single release was performed by that song's writer, Dan Hartman, who was previously known for singing on The Edgar Winter Group's ""Free Ride"" as well as the Disco hit, ""Instant Replay"". The dancer on the table at Torchie's was one Marine Jahan who the previous year was revealed to be Jennifer Beals' dance double in Flashdance. Besides knowing Moranis from ""SCTV"" and some other movies and Ed Begley, Jr. from ""St. Elsewhere"", I also recognized Deborah Van Valkenburgh from ""Too Close for Comfort"" and Lee Ving as the lead singer of the punk band Fear when they appeared on ""Saturday Night Live"". And since I just mentioned that I was born in Chicago, I also feel like noting the other players that came from there: Amy Madigan-who graduated from Marquette University which is where one of my younger sisters also finished school, Robert Townsend, and Kathy Griffin who appears as a concert goer here.",Streets of Fire
9,hitchcockthelegend,"Bombers, Blasters, Attackers and Streets of Fire.",9,18 April 2015,"Streets of Fire is directed by Walter Hill who also co-writes the screenplay with Larry Gross. It stars Michael Paré, Diane Lane, Rick Moranis, Amy Madigan and Willem Dafoe. Music is scored by Ry Cooder and cinematography is by Andrew Laszlo.When the lead singer of Ellen Aim and the Attackers is kidnapped by biker gang The Bombers, her ex-soldier of fortune boyfriend is contacted and hired to go get her back...There were a couple of movies released in 1984 by maverick directors that were frowned upon at the time, but are now significantly held in high regard and define the saying ""cult movie"". One was Alex Cox's Repo Man, the other was Walter Hill's Streets of Fire.Streets of Fire is a bastard hybrid of ideas and influences. In part a rock opera set to the backdrop of blink blink blinkity blink neonvillle, an unnamed place that lives and breathes between 50s angst and 80s futurism, in others it's a straight forward road/mission movie headed up by an anti-hero taking notes from Snake Plissken whilst jostling for cool space with Kyle Reese. It's a film, that by Hill's own admission, is unashamedly a collage of things he finds cool in cinema. Yet this is not a detriment to the pic, the narrative is straightforward as can be and Hill throws everything he can into the mix, and it works.In essence it's a live action comic book, it knows it's just a film and has no pretencions to seem remotely real life. The look is wonderfully flamboyant and campy, where the hero and villain wear braces and PVC overalls respectively. The girls are a mixture of a teenage diva babe and a beer swilling roughneck babe. The city itself is a vibrant mix of colours and carnage, beauty and beats, and where the streets literally are on fire. Hill weighs in with his adroit flair for action, always kinetic, while the soundtrack rocks and the dialogue bubbles with self aware glee. Cast are super, some sexy and tough, others weaselly and weak, but all pumping the pop culture blood through the veins of the movie.With style and cool to burn, both only beaten out by the action quotient, Streets of Fire is an ode to live action fun. And watching it now you can see just how it has influenced many a film maker post its release. Streets of Fire, one bad ass bitch funky sex machine. 9/10",Streets of Fire
10,Hey_Sweden,Flashy entertainment.,8,26 January 2012,"Co-writer / director Walter Hill's ""rock 'n' roll fable"" is well realized, visually stunning stuff with stylistic and thematic ties to his earlier movie ""The Warriors"". If nothing else, he and his crew create the perfect look for this wild update of 1950's B movies. A rising rock star named Ellen Aim (Diane Lane) is kidnapped by a motorcycle gang led by creepy Raven Shaddock (Willem Dafoe). Local diner owner Reva (Deborah Van Valkenburgh) appeals to her long lost brother Tom (Michael Pare), who used to date Ellen, to rescue her (although it's not necessarily just the girl that needs to be saved, but the neighbourhood in general), and he agrees to do so - as long as he gets paid. He and his motley collection of sidekicks, Ellen's nerdy but aggressive manager, Billy Fish (Rick Moranis) and his spunky new acquaintance, McCoy (Amy Madigan) team up to track Ellen down and get her back. A few key personnel help to make this a pleasure to both look at and listen to, and those are production designer John Vallone, cinematographer Andrew Laszlo, and composer Ry Cooder. The ambiance of the various sets seriously smokes, creating the perfect backdrop for this engaging bit of pulp story telling, the story definitely hearkening back to ""The Warriors"" as our unlikely group have to embark on a bit of a journey to get back to where they need to be. And, as others have said, while the movie is not without its dramatic moments, it never pretends to be truly serious about what it's doing. It's all in fun. The soundtrack (including such irresistible material as ""One Bad Stud"") is absolutely incredible, and may have the viewers bopping along to it without realizing they're doing so. The cast is very well chosen, with Pare displaying low key bad ass charisma and Dafoe investing his villain with plenty of swagger. Lane is of course just lovely, Moranis very good as a basically annoying character, and Madigan quite appealing. Tons of familiar faces turn up in supporting parts and bits: Richard Lawson, Rick Rossovich, Bill Paxton, Lee Ving, Grand L. Bush, Mykelti Williamson, Robert Townsend, Elizabeth Daily, Lynne Thigpen, Ed Begley Jr., John Dennis Johnston, Olivia Brown, Peter Jason, and Matthew Laurance. ""Streets of Fire"" may be one of those cases where the style matters more than the substance, but when the style works this well - right down to the scene transitions - it's hard to really complain.

11,preppy-3,Great forgotten 1980s movie,10,3 January 2000,"Director Walter Hill describes the movie this way: The Leader of the Pack (Willem DaFoe) kidnaps the Queen of the Hop (Diane Lane) and Soldier Boy (Michael Pare) comes home to rescue her. Sounds REAL strange but it works. It starts off with the words ""A different time, a different place"" then goes whizzing into action. Ellen Aim (Lane) is playing a concert in her home town. A guy from the bad side of town (Dafoe) and his gang kidnap her. Her former lover (Pare) comes back to save her.OK let's get the bad things out of the way--lousy poster (I've NEVER seen such bad artwork), laughable dialogue and what-the-hell-is going-on performances. But everything else is great! Incredible sets (all neon and moody lighting), fantastic rock score, colorful costumes, wonderful direction by Hill, great action sequences and a total refusal to take itself seriously. It moves VERY quickly and there's never a dull moment! It does lose a lot on video--this should be seen on a wide screen with stereo--that's how I originally saw it in 1984, and for the entire length of the movie I was mesmerized!

12,LeonLouisRicci,Surrealism To Burn and An Energy of Enthiusiasm,8,25 August 2012,"Another stylish middle-budgeted macho movie from a Director who entertains with a visual flare that evokes Pulp and Comic Book aesthetics and an ear for the music and the action of the streets painted with neon and littered with glitter.What makes this film so successful is its ability to incorporate cinema music with renditions imitating real life music. The eighties and fifties, radio friendly Techno and Rockabilly with a dash of Doo-wop are presented here with authenticity lacking in most Hollywood tries at this problematic presentation.There is surrealism to burn with an energy of enthusiasm that is persistent in all of the Director's work. A real auteur with a passion for pictures that are highly entertaining and never boring. An under rated Cultist who makes films that tickle the spine.",Streets of Fire
13,lastliberal,"Everywhere I go, there's always an asshole.",7,30 June 2007,"On the one hand there is Ry Cooders music, which always means that a film is worth watching. Five songs performed by the Ry Cooder Band in one movie is just delicious. But, there was more good music in here than that, so when things weren't exploding or people weren't fighting, there was enough to keep me very interested.However, this wasn't a music video, but a movie. Michael Paré (Bloodrayne), in one of his early films, plays the bad boy who comes back into town to rescue his old girlfriend, Diane Lane (Unfaithful, The Perfect Storm), in what will not be one of her memorable performances. He is assisted in his quest by Amy Madigan, who did a good enough job that she was awarded Best Actress at one film festival for her role. Along for the ride is Rick Moranis, who Walter Hill and Larry gross gave absolutely the worst lines ever. He played the manager and new boyfriend, and I can imagine Lane dumping him quick when her career takes off.The evil one is our good friend Willem Dafoe (Shadow of the Vampire, Platoon), who takes a good beating from our hero before he rides out of town to save someone else.Not a whole lot of action, but what there was was good, and we do have Ry Cooder's music and Marine Jahan's dancing to keep us occupied during breaks.

14,zardoz-13,Sensational Little Shoot'em Up!!!,9,24 March 2017,"""Extreme Prejudice"" director Walter Hill's ""Streets of Fire,"" with Michael Paré, Diane Lane, and Willem Dafoe, ranks as one of those obscure urban adventure epics that nobody appreciated when it was released in 1984. Most critics hated it, and the film coined only about half of its reported $14.5 million budget. Admittedly, it seems like a goulash of genres, ranging from musicals to actioneers to neo-noir thrillers, and comedy, that flies all over the place like buckshot without wearing out its welcome. Happily, Will and co-scenarist Larry Gross swirl these elements so that they all come together beautifully in a neat little actioneer. The bloodless action takes place in what appears to be the 1950s in an anonymous city that resembles Chicago considering that the skyline is dominated by elevated railways. The characters dress as if they are from the 1950s, and the cars look like they hail from the same era. Composer Ry Cooder's soundtrack and the various top-40 songs used in it are ideal for the action. The concert scenes are incredibly charismatic, and Diane Lane behaves like a genuine rock star. The beautifully lensed action follows the formula of a myth about heroes who embark on a journey of hardship to a faraway destination to save an imprisoned damsel-in-distress from a slimy, pugnacious villain. What sets this movie apart from most is its reluctance to wallow in bloodshed and death. If you watch closely nobody bites the dust, and there isn't a lot of gritty action. The climactic, close-quarters combat scene between Mind you, the settings and the heroes and villains all look rugged and dirty, but ""Streets of Fire"" doesn't turn into a high-octane opus. Raven Shaddock (Willem Dafoe of ""Platoon"") and his gang of obnoxious motorcycle maniacs nick-named 'the Bombers' kidnap popular singer Ellen Aim (Diane Lane of ""Unfaithful"") during a concert and haul her off to a remote location where Shaddock wants to play house with her. Reva Cody (Deborah Van Valkenburgh of ""The Warriors"") watches the gang drag Ellen off stage during a concert, and she contacts her brother Tom Cody (Michael Paré of ""Eddie and the Cruisers"") who used to date her and asks him to rescue her. ""Look, Tom, you were always real close with Ellen,"" Reva reminds him. ""She wasn't like all those tramps you used to run around with."" Meantime, Aim's manager/boyfriend Billy Fish (Rick Moranis of ""Ghostbusters"") reluctantly agrees to hire Tom for $10-thousand. As it happens, Tom decides to bring along a gruff Army mechanic McCoy (Amy Madigan of ""Field of Dreams"") to act as his back-up. He met her during a brief bar fight when she slugged the barkeep from trying to run her off. McCoy is a tough looking gal who knows how to handle firearms. ""I need the job. I'm plenty good enough and I ain't gonna let you down,"" she assures Tom. No sooner do all three meet than brusque Billy Fish looks with utter contempt at her, and she whittles him down to size with sarcasm. ""You know, it's hard to figure out what's more pathetic, the way you talk or the way you dress."" Neither of them back off throughout this tightly forged rock'n roll fable. Cody, Fish, and McCoy enter a murky place called 'The Battery' where low-lifers and perverts hang out, guzzle liquor, and raise hell. They learn from a shadowy denizen of the area, Ben Gunn (Ed Begley Jr. of ""Cat People""), where Raven has holed up with Ellen. Cody starts blasting away at bikers as they careen around the Battery while McCoy keeps several of them distracted long enough for Cody to snatch Ellen. Raven confronts Cody as Ellen and he are about to depart. ""Looks like I finally ran into someone that likes to play as rough as I do,"" Raven observes and then vows to come after Cody. ""I'll be coming for her, and I'll be coming for you too."" Tom is terribly impressed with Raven's threat. Says Tom, ""Sure, you will, and I'll be waiting."" Unable to use the convertible that Cody had commandeered earlier from a bunch of snotty-nosed kids at Reva's dinner, they appropriate a bus belonging to an African-American singing group the Sorels. Eventually, Raven and Cody square off in a daylight brawl wielding fireman axes. Predictably, Tom defeat Raven. Ellen is pleased that Tom rescued her, but these two—no matter how much they loved each other before—cannot walk off hand-in-hand. Tom explains, ""Look, I know you're gonna be going places with your singing and stuff, but then I'm not the kind of guy to be carrying your guitars around for you. But if you ever need me for something, I'll be there."" They walk away from each in a bittersweet finale.Reportedly, Hill had planned to develop a franchise from ""Streets of Fire,"" but the box office failure of the film sealed its doom. Nevertheless, I love this film, have seen it many times, and think the soundtrack is fabulous. The dialogue is very hop, too. Nobody gives a bad performance. Michael Paré is ideal as the wandering soldier, and Diane Lane looks like a real heartbreaker. Amy Madigan is superb as the gun-toting mechanic. Of course, Willem Dafoe makes a terrific villain. ""Streets of Fire"" is an incendiary actioneer with loads of atmosphere and catchy dialogue.",Streets of Fire
15,Uriah43,Requires a Person to Use Their Imagination,7,18 January 2014,"When a beautiful rock-and-roll star by the name of ""Ellen Aim"" (Diane Lane) is kidnapped by a motorcycle gang led by ""Raven"" (Willem Dafoe) it results the return of Ellen's old boyfriend ""Tom Cody"" (Michael Pare) to attempt to rescue her. But in order to do that he will need to go into ""the Battery"" and take her back by force. And he will definitely need some help. Anyway, this is a unique movie that is set in an alternate reality combining a 50's urban backdrop with late-70's music which, strangely enough, seemed to fit very well together. Same thing with the attitude displayed by Raven,Tom and his associate ""McCoy"" (Amy Madigan). I especially enjoyed the banter between McCoy and Ellen's manager, ""Billy Fish"" (Rick Moranis). Priceless. Likewise, the music featured by ""the Sorels"" and both performances by Ellen Aim were simply outstanding. That said, while the plot is rather simple and straight-forward, I firmly believe that in order to really enjoy this film it requires a person to use their imagination and totally disregard reality. In any case, this is one of those films that I have seen several times and I never seem to get tired of watching. Above average.",Streets of Fire

17,Aaron1375,"Sounds like a cool action movie, but it is actually a musical with strange twists and such.",6,2 April 2010,"Yes, this movie is set in another time and place which perhaps means the movie is set in another world. However, for the most part the city they are in looks kind of like Chicago to me, and for the most part does not really look all that different from a city in this world and at that time, except the villains in this strange alternate world as it were, wear rubber fishing pants. Still, I loved the music that was played throughout the movie as most of the songs really kind of rocked. I was just not all that keen on the story for the most part. I mean I enjoy a good kidnapping plot, I just did not like the whole hot girl dating Rick Morranis thing. It also could have used more action or something, but then it would not have been as good a musical or something. The actors are all right though and it was an enjoyable enough movie for the most part it just needed more touches of action here and there and a better ending would have helped too. Of course, that ending could have also represented the another time and place thing as in this alternate dimension or whatever the geek gets the hot girl and the hero gets a rather butch soldier girl. Still scratching my head over that one.",Streets of Fire
18,Mr-Fusion,Wholly unique,7,10 March 2012,"""Streets of Fire"" is billed as a rock and roll fable, but eclectic is the best way to describe this. It's a comic book, but also a fantasy, western, alternate reality, chock full of bikers and greasers and thrown together on a rain-soaked neon-lit backlot. Looking at the clothes and cars in this movie is to imagine MTV being around in the '50s. Heady stuff, and makes for terrific midnight viewing. This is a movie that, not only features the smoldering heat of Diane Lane as a rock singer, but also Rick Moranis as her tough-talking manager. Doesn't seem like a good fit, but it totally works here. At the end of the day, it's just a great Walter Hill action movie.7/10",Streets of Fire
19,christopher-underwood,one hell of a tight and fast moving tale,8,25 October 2017,"It's a very simple little story, I don't particularly like Michael Pare, Diane Lane & Rick Moranis in the lead roles or the 80's music BUT this is one hell of a tight and fast moving tale, catching its own reflection in the neon drenched puddles as it goes. Fantastic set design and a sure camera draw one into this near apocalyptic vision as the streets burn and that music roars away like some death rattle. Amy Madigan is very good as potential sidekick to Pare (the part was written for a guy and apparently the film was the first of a proposed trilogy - abandoned when this visionary, ahead of its time movie flopped) and Willem Dafoe as good as ever despite a rotten costume. Influential and highly underrated.",Streets of Fire

Or the Café 50s even Elijah Wood wouldn't play baby games in?Admittedly, in this terrible movie, I loved the music! I know, sooo 80s, but sometimes didn't sound like it. Or maybe I'm just an old-timer. Eh, it was good music in a bad film.At the four-way intersection of Streets of Fire are the four worst aspects of this ""movie:"" bad acting, horrifying script, shoddy editing and laughable scene transitions. In the middle of the intersection are the WTF moments, like the male/female go-go dancer, the ""Oh, I guess they blew a tire"" missing scene or the sucker punch to safety. The only pedestrian is the one that creepily stares at his ex on stage for an incredibly long time.Actually, though I just ruined a part of the ""climax,"" that's a common theme during this: so many very long segments that either made zero sense or should've been cut all together. One of the funniest was the over long rescue of the princess chapter that ends with the ""good"" guys getting awayfor-evahalways worrying about being followed. In normal movies, or I guess in life, yeah they would be easily followed. Nope. Some rogue ex-military dude is hired to save his thankless ex from unmotivated non-gay, gay kidnappers in leather chaps. When he does save the soulless singer ex-girlfriend, the Queen B(iker) merely threatens to come get him, but I guess in a civilized way? He/she needn't worry about the round-the-clock, 2-person police force that wouldn't know the law if it were written on the cue cards they obviously used.There's barely a character to cling to, or anyone with an ounce of charisma sans the non-lesbian, lesbian McCoy. She's pretty badass. Everyone else was there for a paycheck. Lucky for them, most of their careers weren't affected by this rubbish. I am divided if I should recommend this. On the positive, (again) the music's great and there are so many outrageous scenes that it almost qualifies this as a So-Bad-It's-Good flick. But, flipping the coin, it's a lazy ""action"" movie that has no clue what decade it's in and feels like a 2-hour film with a half-hour of crucial plot points cut out.I know! Just YouTube (or buy, you cheap bastard) the soundtrack. You'll hear all the good songs without the crap these filmmakers put in-between the music.***Final thoughts: I only watched this for that great How Did This Get Made? podcast where they talk about bad movies usually for about as long as the movie itself. I don't think I ever even heard of this movie and spent most of the movie staring at the singer of the story, Ellen Aim(less) and trying to picture the Diane Lane I know of from more modern and better films, like Under the Tuscan Sun and Man of Steel.

Also tagging along with Cody and Fish is a gruff-up female ex-solider McCoy.Pulsating pulp streams from Walter Hill's visually smoking and rockabilly live comic strip feature ""Streets of Fire (1984)"". Director Walter Hill stylishly crafts the film's distinctive texture with great verve, potent symbolism and iconic detail. A storm is cooked up with plentiful action scenes that pack a lean bite and Hill manages to keep it rather poised when the pace has settled. Andrew Laszlo's loose camera-work colourfully sets up each scene with use good use of lighting and shadows. Also the razor sharp editing adds to the film's snappy flair and groovy style.The melodramatically simple plot is bare-thread and quirky dialogues are mostly filled with toughly forwarded one-liners. On the other hand the broodingly howling music (written by Stevie Nicks, Ry Cooder and Tom Petty) implemented gives it more weight, punch and oozes out the emotional input. The dark, moody lyrics really shape and tell the story, more so than a basic narrative structure. It's a feast for the ears, but also the eyes get a good workout on this fantasy rock safari. The striking art direction and atmospheric designs are grandly staged. This musty urban rock 'n roll landscape crosses retro decors with a neon touch amongst its modernly futuristic (well 80s) flashes. Everything about the 1980s and 1950s become one, in this uniquely wrapped and uncanny universe.Hill masterfully picks up a strong cast that are tailor made for the parts. Diane Lane is a knockout as Ellen Aim and Michael Pare's hardboiled performance crackles with right charm. What screen time a dry William Dafoe does get, he milks it out superbly as the scrawny, but snake-like biker villain Rave Shaddock. Amy Madigan is simply a winner in her role as Cody's firebrand tomboy partner McCoy. Rick Moranis likewise as the weasel music manager Billy Fish. Even Bill Paxton (who looks the part), Deborah Van Valkenburgh and Richard Lawson show up in small, but amusing performances.""Streets of Fire"" happens to be refreshing, extravagant and a rapidly entertaining piece of work by Hill and co.

22,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,Hill scores in the middle,7,7 April 2006,"STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits It would appear that before Michael Pare became an unheard of video star in the 90s he did actually have something of a big screen career once mainly in the shape of this Walter Hill fantasy adventure, Sin City 1980s style set against a colourful back-drop of a futuristic world laced with some sort of 1950s throw-back.Tom Cody (Mr Pare) a mercenary for hire, is called back to his old home town when his ex-girlfriend (Diane Lane) is kidnapped by a gang of bikers lead by a younger Willem Dafoe. But finding her won't be easy and he'll need the help of an annoying, obnoxious Rick Moranis and the Real McCoy (Amy Madigan) a tough former soldier who drinks at his local bar. But even when girlfriend is rescued, it will still become a battle to see off the troublesome gang once and for all.Bustling along with a hollering bar-room live band soundtrack and a faded out screen style of moving things along, Streets of Fire is a movie with a lot of style but much less substance, a colourful, lively but ultimately rather empty experience. Pare makes a fair big screen hero, Moranis puts his annoying nerd appeal to good use, Madigan is convincing as a tough chick and Dafoe is unrecognizable as the main bad guy but the cast certainly make it shine more than Hill does. ***",Streets of Fire
23,Irishchatter,Good 80s film with a brilliant soundtrack!,8,18 May 2017,"I honestly did enjoy the film and its soundtrack. I loved the songs ""TONIGHT IS WHAT IT MEANS TO BE YOUNG"" and ""ONE BAD STUD"" because they both were just powerful, danceable and just marvelous to hear. The soundtrack reminds me a mix of ""Blues Brothers"" and ""Rock of Ages"". Now I have to say, Michael Paré and Willem Dafoe didn't have good wardrobe.I thought the brown shirt Pare had was just disgusting on him, hes not playing a farmer for god sake! As well with Defoe having no shirt on and a black thing around him, he also looked like a farmer guy rather than a greaser. Also the clothes he wore as being the bad guy, looked really too small for him!Good movie, you can't get the songs out of your head because they are just so brilliant!

It really is a shame that this was a box office failure, as this could have been a great trilogy in my opinion, plus Michael Paré is really good as the main lead, a bit wooden at times, but he fit the part very well and was a major bad ass!. The sets are just incredible, there so stylish, and yes some of the dialog was cheesy but that also fit in with the film well, plus Pare had great chemistry with both Lane and Amy Madigan!. Rick Moranis surprised the hell out of me by giving a mature non goofy performance, and Willem Dafoe is wonderfully OTT as the main villain,plus there final showdown was great!. Don't look for any character development here because you won't find it, but you will find plenty of other stuff that will satisfy you, plus there is plenty of great music to enjoy as well. I'll keep this short and sweet, awesome soundtrack awesome movie, I say it's a must see!. The Direction is great!. Walter Hill does a great! job here, with very good camera work, excellent angles, great stylized looking sets, and keeping the film at a very fast pace. The Acting is a lot of fun!. Michael Paré is a lot of fun to watch here, he may seem a bit wooden, but he clearly had a lot of potential to be a great action star, as he showed it here, he was also a bad ass, had fantastic chemistry with lane and Madigan, had some cool lines, the only thing I didn't dig what he did was when he punched Lane in the face, other then that he was top notch!. Diane Lane is stunningly gorgeous, and is amazing here, she plays one of her best characters looked fantastic on stage, had a beautiful dress, and just had some classic moments with Pare, she was amazing. (Lane Rules!!!!!!!). Rick Moranis is surprisingly fantastic as the jerk of a manager, and proved he can play non buffoon roles, I loved it!. Amy Madigan is excellent as tough chick with attitude, she had great chemistry with pare, and was kind of cute to boot, I loved her. Willem Dafoe is wonderful as the main villain, he was totally OTT, and looked so young, he was a lot of fun to watch!. Deborah Van Valkenburgh does well as Pare's sister, I liked her. Richard Lawson and Rick Rossovich are good as the somewhat dimwitted officers. Bill Paxton is good as the goofy bartender I dug him. Elizabeth Daily is amusing as the obsessed fan I liked her. Stoney Jackson,Grand L. Bush and Robert Townsend are good as the Dorels. Rest of the cast do fine. Overall a must see!. **** out of 5",Streets of Fire

But freeing the songstress is only half of the battle as a hammer fight is the only conclusion.A stylish blend of 1950s aesthetic and 1980s music, this cult hit from the ladder time period is in a class of its own. But a notable soundtrack and an indistinct era isn't enough to save the dull lead or the script's comic-bookish narrative.Furthermore, if you did blend the '50s with the '80s you would get McCarthyists with feathered bangs.Yellow Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca",Streets of Fire
26,atlasmb,Rock Noir,9,17 July 2021,"This film is a highly stylized rock drama that was envisioned by writer/director Roy Hill. It feels like an extended music video, with its emphasis on strong imagery.The story is about a social outsider who drops into town and gets involved in rescuing his former flame. Michael Pare is the blue collar hero, Tom Cody, who dares to confront a gang lead by the biker named Raven (Willem Dafoe) to save his ex, Ellen Aim (Diane Lane), who is a singer. Along for the ride are McCoy (Amy Madigan), a lady warrior with a chip on her shoulder, and Ellen's manager and boyfriend Billy Fish (Rick Moranis), who is all mouth and Napoleonic complex.The action occurs in an indeterminate place and time, allowing for various artistic styles. The music includes some recognizably Jim Steinman anthems and atmospheric Ry Cooder pieces. One of the film's highlights is the song ""I Can Dream About You"", performed by a black doo-wop/R&B group named The Sorels, who are also on the quest.All of the casting seems inspired. It was Madigan's idea, reportedly, for her sidekick role to be played by a woman. In the early career of Diane Lane, this film fits neatly between Coppola's teen pieces ""The Outsiders"" / ""Rumblefish"" and the sophisticated period piece ""The Cotton Club"".This is a neo-noir classic that opts for boldness over nuance. It may be simplistic, but it is fun.",Streets of Fire
27,Bored_Dragon,A dystopian neo-noir that compensates for a bad script with a great atmosphere and music,7,8 July 2021,"The place and time of this story are undefined. It is an alternative dimension that combines cars from the fifties, with the image and music of the eighties, the ambience of ""Dark City"" and the atmosphere that resembles the movies ""The Warriors"" and ""West Side Story"".During the concert, a motorcycle gang, led by Raven (Willem Dafoe), kidnaps rock singer Ellen Aim (Diane Lane) directly from the stage. Her boyfriend and manager (Rick Moranis) hires her ex-boyfriend, a mercenary soldier (Michael Paré), to rescue her.The story is a linear cliché - good guys, bad guys, femme fatale, he still loves his ex, she still loves him, but they are not destined, he is a one-man-army antihero, blah-blah. The good guys smash the bad guys, save the damsel in distress and our hero rides out into the night. A romance that doesn't touch you emotionally, predictable action, and two-dimensional characters that throw out shabby phrases.And yet, the film has everything I wanted to experience as a teenager, even in front of a movie screen. Awesome cars with the pedal to the metal, wicked motorcyclists, rock music, macho guys in leather, which I dreamed to be, and the nightlife I wanted to live. As kids, we were very fond of this film, so even now, when I am able to see it objectively, I cannot resist the rush of nostalgia.And of course, I have to mention the main trump card of ""Streets of Fire"" - the music. The whole soundtrack is great, but the only two songs by the studio band Fire Inc, formed especially for this occasion, ""Nowhere Fast"" and ""Tonight Is What It Means to Be Young"" became hit classics of the genre.7/10.",Streets of Fire

29,eddie_baggins,"A unique ""almost"" film",6,1 September 2021,"One of the biggest examples of an ""almost"" film you're likely to see, Walter Hill's genre mash-up of thriller, drama, musical and neon-soak western Streets of Fire was designed as a ""Rock n Roll fable"" that was tag-lined as ""Tonight is what it means to be young"" but this rarely spoken about oddity was a failed franchise starter that wasn't quite able to get all elements humming in harmony, despite it still being a unique and important part of Hill's often undervalued filmography.Regarded in cinema circles for his work behind the camera on films such as Southern Comfort, The Warriors and 48 Hrs. As well as a being key figure behind the classic Alien series, Hill has had an incredibly diverse and original journey in Hollywood, with his passion project here one that looked to combine some of the writer/directors favorite cinematic staples into one entertaining package but you can see throughout the entirety of the film the struggle that it faces to be so many things all at once as the film only ever gels together in brief but memorable moments.Taking place in a rain drenched unnamed city (with the films rain effects eating into a large chunk of the movies budget), Fire kicks things off with a fully-fledged concert performance from Diane Lane's Ellen Aim, who is briskly kidnapped mid-performance by Willem Dafoe's Raven and his gang of motorbike riding hoodlums, only to find herself planned to be rescued by her ex-boyfriend Tom Cody (Michael Pare in one of his biggest lead turns) and a motley crew, with the film barely pausing for breath between songs, beat-ups, one liners and Dafoe's latex outfits.It's an insane hybrid of ideas and moments, the film is about as 80's as you'd get with Ry Cooder's score, the Blade Runner like sets and fashion all well and truly of the era but you can also sense the Western influences on the film with Cody's trench coach sporting ex-soldier turned mercenary the type of character you could see being created with Clint Eastwood in mind, while the Rock and Roll undertones (and Rick Moranis supporting turn) other components to a film that wanted to reach for the stars and do things its own way, only to find itself treading water in the middle ground on its way too being an entertaining conjuring that didn't cast the spell it wanted to.For all its failure's too properly launch or stick the landing, there's little doubt that Fire is one of the more ambitious box office disasters of the 80's, one that provides to this day a solid viewing alternative to modern day affairs that can often be produce of a tired and copycat heavy system, with Hill's film further proof that the Hollywood legend is a director that walked his on path to create products for the ages.Final Say -It's not the slam dunk you'd hope it too be but this undervalued piece of 80's cinema is unlike anything you've ever seen before or since with Streets of Fire a film you need to watch to understand.3 concert posters out of 5.",Streets of Fire

The cast is very likable. The songs are great. The set design is unbelievable. It should have been nominated for an Oscar. The editing was also worthy of a nomination.

32,videorama-759-859391,Streets I like,8,28 April 2020,"Streets Of Fire is unlike any other WH film, you've seen. A true original. I hadn't seen this movie in 36 years, and truthfully didn't remember much about it at all. Coming to view it again, exactly 428 months later (had seen it 27/8/1984) brought back memories. It has cool acting especially from Pare, who fits the bill perfectly. It has great pounding music too, and most of all, an atmosphere, the famous Ell Train underneath, a principal location, most memorably noted or represented by psycho gang leader, bikie, Dafoe and his large entourage of punks, called The Bombers, who come roaring down this famous street, while undermining police authority. Lane as this beautiful singer (and we kind of get the feeling, she's not really interested, acting in this project) is kidnapped by Dafoe. (Deborah Val Valkenberg) truly an avid fan of Lane, enlists the help of her big brother- mercenary Pare, who's paid a big fee by Lane's current boyfriend/manager (Moranis of all people) to retrieve our stolen beauty, in the worst, and most, uncivilized part of town- The Battery. The plotting of this movie is simple, but just has an undying energy about it, no matter, when you watch. It's just something different, which will have you cheering in the finale. I do love the songs in this movie, especially the nice little track with unaccompanied sound, by the discovered black band, Pare hijacks, on returning from rescuing our beauty. Pare is so cool in this, and grabs the helm in the lead. Standouts though are Dafoe, and surprisingly Moranis. And I can't forget, Madigan as a rebellious drifter with attitude who aids Pare, on his paid retrieval. Take Lane (usually a really good actress who ages well) out of the equation, and there's good acting by all. I really liked Valkenberg's strong performance in this too, and a brief appearance by Tuff Turf's Mones as the head honcho of this pathetic Bomber's wannabe gang in the film's earlier bit, in between opening credits.Again WH has made a hit, and a film I love in quite a big list of WH films.If only, you could of shown more enthusiasm, Diane.",Streets of Fire
33,hellraiser7,Fire of Love and Rock,10,2 June 2020,"Warning don't read unless seen film.This is another one of my favorite films of all time and it's my favorite film from one of my favorite movie directors Walter Hill. This film is also an adolescent gem as I saw this film when I was about 14 and it blew my mind as rock in roll is my favorite genre of music and I was really exploring more of what it had to offer, along with movies based on it.This film really was something else, it's one of those films you don't see every day and in a sense is a film that predates the anime series ""Cowboy Bebop"". Just like in that series this film is a mix of western, fantasy, musical, and action all genres mixed in a blender which results in a really tasty milk shake. Also, the film is more style overtopping substance, thought this film does have some really good substance.My only real problem with the film is Eddie Fish played by Rick Moranis which I'll admit I found strange, don't get me wrong he's one of my favorite comedic actors but this is not one of my favorite roles from him, I honestly felt he was a little out of place in this film. He just seems to be one of those roadblock characters, as he's not very well rounded or fleshed out, I honest didn't buy that both Ellen and him were an item, as there is no chemistry between theme; maybe it's a professional business relationship.But other than that, everything else in the film is great. This film just has so much despite such a small amount of time. I really love the look of the film, the setting I think is really cool and unique sort of reminds me a little of Gotham city from ""Batman the Animated Series""; man Walter Hill directing a Batman film that would have been something.Anyway, the whole setting is sort of an alternate America where it looks a little like 1950's America where we see the cars, motorbikes, gresser jackets and hairstyles, diner, just anything else you now would see at your museum.However, we see some other things there that look like their from different eras, like certain equipment and wardrobe you would normally see in the present day. This goes to show that this is a world that isn't set in our world but in an alternate world/fantasy realm where all conventional rules do not apply, in this realm everything is different, and anything is possible. It makes sense some things would be from the 50's as that was a time when Rock n Roll was born.The place is nit and gritty but there is also a sense of warmth and charm about the place as it has that feeling of familiarity, kind of like going back to the hometown you use to live in, with me it was Yakima, WA for a while. But also, a place where despite rough circumstances there are other dreams and dreamers waiting to emerge.The film is also a musical but not in the conventional sense, which makes the film even cooler as the Musical genre also isn't my genre, there are very few musicals that I'm into unless it somehow is part of my venue like ""Rocky Horror Picture Show"", etc. It's not a musical in a conventional sense because characters don't spontaneously break into song and dance after a matter of minutes, which you have to admit is weird sometimes. Here it's more on a suttle level where there is music, but it come only in certain places of the film and when there is singing it's by the sings themselves onstage. I really like this because it feels like music happens in all the right places and times and don't interfere with the progression of the story in any way; let alone there aren't many musicals like this except for the film ""The Last Dragon"" another favorite film of my and story.Action is solid and well choreographed from some shootouts but it's the final one on one battle with the pickaxes I really like. The songs and soundtrack in this film is fantastic, there are just so many memorable songs in this film, I'll just say two that I like.Nowhere Fast: This song happens at the very start of the film, which to me is one of the best openings of a film as the sequence pretty much perfectly sets up the whole plotline in just a matter of minutes, instead of having to sometimes excruciatingly wait long minutes for the plot to build up and get going; this film like a video game just thrust you in right now.The song itself is great as it perfect reflects the story of the film but also the characters Ellen and Cody and even foreshadows their relationship where it's going and going to go.I Can Dream About You: This song is just beautiful and is one of my favorite songs in general. The song as cheerful and beautiful as it sounds it's actually really bittersweet and perfectly reflects the final minutes of the film.The film has a good cast some of them before they even became stars at all. Like the late Bill Paxton whom you see a few times in the movie has a small role, which is cool as most well know actors and actresses had their start doing those roles.Amy Madigan is sold as McCoy. I really like that she's a rough, spunky, feisty female soldier that even though not on the same level as Tom, is still good enough to kick some ass which is why she's a good back up.Both Tom and her have a good back and forth, which makes the film at times almost a buddy cop film; which makes sense as the 80s were big on that subgenre with ""Lethal Weapon"" and the under the radar TV show ""Hunter"". The film could of easily of made a love triangle with Ellen, McCoy and Tom going on but glad they didn't as I'm personally not a fan of love triangles, let alone I never felt Tom and McCoy felt more for each other except as buddies. And she really is a good person who is supporting Tom and helping steer him in the right direction and do what he needs to do or should do.William Dafoe an honorable mention in favorite actors in my book, he plays a solid villain let along looks radically different in this movie. He's an archetypal villain but still a fun performance all the same and a villain you love to hate. He's a gresser or modern day bandit leader that is obviously emotionally unstable, he doesn't really have much of a reason doing what he does except simple to maintain the stranglehold he has on the town as Ellen Aim is a mere obstacle for total supremacy.But the heart of the film to me are the two main leads: Tom Cody and Ellen Aim.Michael Pare another of my list of under the radar actors is just awesome as Tom Cody, it's a shame the actor didn't have a little more afterward. But anyway Tom Cody is awesome I really like the western get up he wears with that overcoat which is similar to the outfit Malcolm Reynolds wears in the TV show ""Firefly"" heck Tom Cody's character is a bit similar to him, hmm makes me wonder if Joss Wheldon is a fan of this film.Anyway, his character is a bad ass as we see fighting comes to him as easy as breathing, like there is one scene with this gang. The leader whips out a butterfly knife and does the open close trick but Tom just takes it and does the same trick but a lot better and slaps the leader and this happens again and again; I thought that was cool showing Tom doesn't take crap from anyone.His character is a former solder that now goes around the country as a soldier of fortune. He's not a guy with big dreams and ambitions, but more of a guy that is just looking for something in life, anything. And despite his tough exterior he has warmth, as we see he still harbors strong feelings for Ellen that never changed, as well as sadness as he had to leave her to fight in the war but also for her own good so she can pursue her dreams.Ellen Aim played well by Diane Lane, I remember seeing this I had a crush on the actress as she is just fraking hot, probably another one of the hottest women on the planet. This is probably my favorite role from her as it's not a role she commonly plays, let alone it's one of those roles that only happen to actors and actresses once in a lifetime. Ellen Aim to me is sort of what the character Minmei from the anime ""Macross"" wanted to be but failed miserably.Ellen despite the fame she earned and obtained she never let it get to her head. She's not self-centered nor oblivious to people around her and their feelings mainly Tom's. The fact that she's held a concert in her hometown just shows that she's never forgotten who she is and where she came from. She's also never forgotten Tom and what she feels toward him.The chemistry between both is just beautiful, when their both tougher it really feels like they belong. But also, that both have something in common that their both searchers (hence Ellen's last name), from what they've gained it wasn't without it's costs; as both still don't have certain things in their life mainly love. The fact both found each other again shows feelings and whatever they thought they lost in the past isn't truly gone.The film has many themes, for one it's sort of a love letter toward Rock N Roll and the culture it has created. The other theme is about letting go, which makes this romance tale all the more unique as it's one of those ones where even though two people can love each other that doesn't mean their meant to be; I personally like those kinds of romance stories because it gives the genre more variation but most importantly that's just part of what happens in romance and life in general.I'll admit one part of me wants Ellen and Cody to somehow stay together and make it work. But that of course is wishful thinking at best, because in the back of our minds we know both of them despite having the same feelings for each other their aims in life are different.

Despite that the result of this meeting could have been interesting to watch, (Streets of Fire - 1984) ended up not interesting as action, crime, drama, or musical!Simply I didn't understand the world of this movie. So, it's a violent 1950s with no geriatrics, only twenty-something people. What's the big idea?! There is a talk about a war. What war? And how come that the lead is the only one in town who went to it?!! The whole nation is divided into 2 halves; one is madly in love with that teen rock singer, attending her performances, and the other is riotous hippie, hanging out in strip club. So who ever works in this society?!! I'll tell you; the cafés and the venal police! Then, you read many times that this is a sci-fi? Was the underground metro considered a science fiction in the 1980s movies?!!Of course there was nostalgia for the 1950s during the 1980s, just remember Porky's (1982), Back to the Future (1985), Peggy Sue Got Married (1986), even a TV show like Rags to Riches (1987). It's natural since it got the makers' youth and dreams. Exactly like there was nostalgia towards the 1980s itself later on Fargo (1996), The Wedding Singer (1998), Wet Hot American Summer (2001),.. etc. and for the same reasons. The thing is, here, I couldn't get the reason why, except for the nostalgic feel and the strange atmosphere, rather the outwardly attractive marriage between the 1950s and the street wars. However, with such a totally blank core.All the actors were so young (Diane Lane was only 19), and totally uneven. Yes (Rick Moranis), (Amy Madigan), and (Deborah Van Valkenburgh) were the side characters, but they acted very well, chewing up the scenery entirely from the main characters that were done terribly by (Michael Paré), (Diane Lane), and (Willem Dafoe). (Paré) was just the boy who can't be, by any mean, the angry, inwardly sad, returnee soldier. Thank God that (Diane Lane) has developed into the wonderful actress she is now, otherwise she would have been a cold beauty queen. And (Dafoe), oh (Dafoe). He was extremely ridiculous wearing a long fishing trousers shirtless, with really laughable haircut. Not to mention the ton of white, meaningless, make-up over his face, with one-note evil smile. He looked like a laughably dumb bully, or - at best - a walking statue of wax!Most of the action was superb. The sets gave a good background. The dialogue was gritty and witty, being maybe the best, most solid, element in the whole movie. The songs were horrible. I felt like ""So that's how the other songs of Bonny Taylor, else I Need A Hero, sound!"". I believed that the sister and the tomboy assistant could be merged into one character better. And the climax wasn't equal to whatever before it.It's obvious that (Walter Hill), as a director and co-writer, did a good job but in a messy form. It wanted to be some sort of modern musical mixed with apocalyptic western, to end up as nothing but a dusty MTV special!It defines blank, having uninteresting time. Enough to say that while I'm a hardcore fan of the 1980s, I slept in front of this movie for the first 2 times I purposed to watch it. And although I completed it at the third one, but I was so unsatisfied at the end, wishing if I slept instead!",Streets of Fire

However, it is the music and action sequences from this film which keep viewers glued to their screens. This film is a complete entertainer which doesn't hesitate at all in disassociating itself from being a ""mere rock and roll fable"". ""Streets of Fire"" launched the career of débutant actor Michael Paré who is remarkable is his role as a man who would not hesitate in liberating his ex-flame from the clutches of an evil man. Hollywood director Walter Hill has made some of the best films in the realm of American cinema. They have made great deal of money and have also enabled viewers to have a nice time by watching them. Most astute viewers know about some of his best box office successes. One can easily cite the names of profitable films namely ""48 hours"" and ""Brewster's Millions"". Lastly, ""Streets of Fire"" needs to be seen by all viewers who would like to see a balanced yet interesting melange of action, music and songs.",Streets of Fire
36,Fluke_Skywalker,Long live rock and roll,8,26 May 2015,"I watched this for the first time about 4-5 years ago and it was like getting sucker punched. You read the plot synopsis--an ex-soldier comes home after his old girlfriend, now an up and coming rock star, is kidnapped by a vicious biker gang--and you think you know what you're getting, but you don't. First of all, it's set in the fifties, but not really. And it's always dark, and there's Jim Steinman music and Willem Defoe in vinyl overalls. It's a lot to take in. But the second time through, when you know the punch is coming, is a whole 'nother ballgame. I loved this movie. It's rock opera with brooding guys and tough dames and clipped, witty dialog. It's definitely not for everyone, but I think it's a movie that's worth watching, even if you end up hating it, if that makes any sense.",Streets of Fire
37,barnabyrudge,Entertaining action movie with a few distinctive touches all of its own.,7,24 January 2007,"Streets Of Fire is a very enjoyable action flick from Walter Hill. It distinguishes itself from all the other action movies out there by presenting a few new angles. For example, the story is set in a strange retro-futuristic society where the hair-styles, music styles and vehicles resemble the 1950s, but the attitudes, costumes and break-down of social etiquette hint at something more futuristic. Also, the story is driven very significantly by music and features many songs that run parallel with the on-screen events, almost summarising the plot in lyric form. As the pre-credit card tells us, this is ""Another time, another place.. A Rock 'n' Roll Fable"".Successful singer Ellen Aim (Diane Lane) returns after a long absence to her hometown neighbourhood of The Richmond to perform a pop concert. Barely has the show begun when a bunch of bikers, known as The Bombers, raid the theatre and kidnap Ellen. One of Ellen's most ardent fans, Reva (Deborah Van Valkenburg), sends a distress message to her brother asking him for help. Reva's brother, Tom Cody (Michael Pare), is a tough soldier of fortune who happens to be an ex-lover of the kidnapped singer. He reluctantly agrees to go into the Bombers' neighbourhood  ""The Battery""  to rescue his old flame. Joining him for the adventure are Ellen's manager and new lover Billy Fish (Rick Moranis) and a hard-hitting female drifter named McCoy (Amy Madigan). The rescue mission goes smoothly enough, but the Bombers' head honcho, Raven (Willem Dafoe), is pretty infuriated to be outwitted in his own back yard, so he wages a personal war of honour against Cody, culminating in a hand-to-hand street fight between the pair of them.Streets Of Fire is tightly paced (like all Hill's films), with precious little wasted footage or excessive dialogue. In some respects the pared-down script is a strength AND a weakness simultaneously, because while it keeps the story moving it also leaves gaps in characterisation. An example of this is the relationship between Ellen and Cody  we know that they once had a thing together, and we know they're close to re-igniting it, but in the end Cody walks away from Ellen because he ""ain't the kinda guy to be carrying her guitar cases around"". The final scene as he walks out on her strives for a great emotional crescendo, but we know so little about them as a couple that it's hard to feel any of the intended emotional impact. Pictorially, the film is very eye-catching with lots of moodily lit scenes and camera activity. Performance-wise, the characters require little more than posturing and that's exactly what they get. Madigan rises above things best as the bruising drifter McCoy, though Lane manages to be fairly believable in the concert sequences and Dafoe's villain is quite convincing. The best thing in the film is the songs  real power ballads that you'll find yourself singing for weeks afterwards, especially the awesome ""Tonight Is What It Means To Be Young"". Streets Of Fire is good fun, an entertaining and enjoyable film with moments of brilliance.",Streets of Fire
38,NateWatchesCoolMovies,"A solid gold classic. There's never been anything like it, and likely never will. Too good to be true.",10,11 May 2016,"Walter Hill's Streets Of Fire is just too good to be true, and yet it exists. It's like the type of dream concept for a movie that you and your coolest friend think up after a bunch of beers and wish you had the time, money and resources to make yourself. It's just cool right down to the bone, a beautiful little opus of 1950's style gang trouble set to a so-good-it-hurts rock n' roll soundtrack devised by the legendary Ry Cooper, Hill's go to music maestro. It's so 80's it's bursting at the seams with the stylistic notes of that decade, and both Hill and the actors stitch up those seams with all the soda jerk, greaser yowls and musical mania of the 50's. Anyone reading up to this point who isn't salivating right now and logging onto amazon to order a copy, well there's just no hope for you. I only say that because for sooommeee reason upon release this one was a financial and critical dud, floundering at the box office and erasing any hope for the sequels which Hill had planned to do. I guess some people just aren't cool enough to get it (can you tell I'm bitter? Lol). Anywho, there's nothing quite like it and it deserves a dig up, Blu Ray transfer and many a revisit. In a nocturnal, neon flared part of a nameless town that looks a little like New York, the streets are humming with excitement as everyone prepares for the nightly musical extravaganza. Darling songstress Ellen Aim (young Diane Lane♡♡) is about to belt out an epic rock ballad in a warehouse dance hall for droves of screaming fans. There's one fan who has plans to do more than just watch, though. Evil biker gang leader Raven Shaddock (Willem Dafoe, looking like Satan crossed with Richard Ramirez) kidnaps her as the last notes of her song drift away, his gang terrorizes the streets and disappears off into the night with poor Ellen as their prisoner. The locals need a hero to go up against Raven and rescue Ellen, and so estranged badass Tom Cody (Michael Paré) is called back to town after leaving years before. He's a strong and silent hotshot who takes no guff from no one, and is soon on the rampage to Raven's part of town. He's got two buddies as well: two fisted, beer guzzling brawler chick McCoy (Amy Madigan), and sniveling event planner Billy Fish (Rick Moranis). That's as much plot as you get and it's all you need, a delightful dime store yarn with shades of The Outsiders and a soundtrack that will have your jaw drop two floors down. The two songs which Ellen sings are heart thumping legends. 'Nowhere Fast' gives us a huge glam-rock welcome into the story, and 'Tonight Is What It Means To Be Young' ushers us out with a monumental bang before the credits roll, and damn if Hill doesn't know how to stage the two songs with rousing and much welcomed auditory excess that'll have you humming for days. Paré is great as the brooding hero, and you won't find too many solid roles like this in his career. He's a guy who somewhat strayed off the path into questionable waters (he's in like every Uwe Boll movie) but he pops up now and again I'm some cool stuff, like his scene stealing cameo in The Lincoln Lawyer. Dafoe clocks in right on time for his shift at the creepshow factory, giving Raven a glowering, makeup frosted grimace that's purely vampiric and altogether unnerving. Him and Paré are great in their street side sledgehammer smackdown in the last act. Bottom line, this is one for the books and it still saddens me how unfavorably it was received... like what were they thinking? A gem in Hill's career, and a solid pulse punding rock opera fable. Oh, and watch for both an obnoxious turn from Bill Paxton and a bizarre cameo from a homeless looking Ed Begley Jr.",Streets of Fire
39,Cristi_Ciopron,"Genuine cultmovie, from a director that knew to play it straight; or, one of the few '80s classics",8,16 December 2007,"To put it blunt, this is how a film like Sin City should of looked. Hill had this unmatched craftsmanship that situated him above the hacks of the '80s.Hill manages the action so skillfully that it's funny and likable and thrilling without becoming a mockery of the genre.Streets of Fire (1984) stands for a very healthy directorial attitudeit's a sane approach in making an action film that actually works.The film is so interesting partly because we see several interesting actors at the beginning of their careers. The wonderful straightforward simplicity and naive charm of Hill's movie make it an always refreshing experience. Of course it is somehow conventional and campbut in a most endearing waythink of what a T. Burton would of made of such a movie --for me,W. Hill proved by such a film that he is a million times better than T. Burton. Too much T. Burton rubbish and referential crap simply sabotages and sears the film; on the contrary, W. Hill offers the compact amusing action movie. In a word, Hill knows to handle the action.And, after all,if so many are put off by the mocktone, why do so many directors feel obliged to give a campymock side to their action films?Fortunately Hill is a director that always preserved the purity of line of his action flicks.See Diane Lane--18 years before Unfaithful (2002) !",Streets of Fire
40,alansabljakovic-39044,Great grimmy Hill movie!,8,30 May 2020,"The opening sequence is one of the most incredible I've ever seen, Walter Hill could easily make a great concert film like Stop Making Sense. The soundtrack in this movie is unbelievable, every song is a banger and totally fits the movie's style. This was intended to be the first in a trilogy of action films starring Michael Paré as Tom Cody but its failure at the box office had put an end to that project. This would be one of the best trilogies of all time... Also Rick Moranis has top 10 punchable faces ever.This piece of trivia is hilarious - Michael Paré had problems with Rick Moranis: ""Rick Moranis drove me out of my mind. There's this whole wave of insult comedy. In the real world, if someone insults you a couple of times, you can smack them. Or punch them. You can't do that on a movie set. And these comedians walk around, and they can say whatever they want. I'm just not that handy with that. Comedians are a special breed. They can antagonize you and say whatever they... want, and you can't do anything to stop them... He's this weird looking little guy who couldn't get laid in a wh*re house with a fistful of fifties. He would imitate me. The first thing he says to me is, ""Do you just act cool, or are you really cool?"" That was the first sentence out of his mouth to me in Joel Silver's office. And I was like, ""Oh... this is not going to go well."" But he was one of Joel's dear friends, and he ended up making a bunch of movies for Disney. I just wasn't that sharp.

41,fertilecelluloid,Extraordinary kinetic work,8,23 December 2005,"Walter Hill, whose fine directorial achievements include ""Hard Times"", ""The Warriors"", ""Southern Comfort"", ""Crossroads"", ""Johnny Handsome"" and ""Extreme Prejudice"", scored another creative bullseye with this self-proclaimed ""rock and roll fable"". Though it is simplistic in the extreme, it is an extraordinarily kinetic work with great music, stunning cinematography, cutting edge editing (from Hill regular Freeman Davies) and fantastic production design.From a purely visual perspective, it was way ahead of its time, and like most things that were ahead of their time, it flopped badly (at the box office). So much of the film is worthy of praise -- the opening credit sequence employs a bravura graphic technique that has been much imitated; the kidnapping of Ellen Aim (Diane Lane) is a stunningly staged sequence, as is Lane's mimed rendition of Jim Steinman's fabulous ""Tonight Is What It Means To Be Young"". The climactic fight sequence between Michael Pare and Willem Dafoe (in one of his first screen roles) is magical, as are all the film's scenes of physical combat.Hill makes mean, lean, muscular movies and populates them with both fresh faces and screen vets. Michael Pare, who had a limited career, is just fine as the mythical Tom Cody, the film's reluctant hero (is there any other?). Dafoe shines as Raven Shaddock, the lead of the kidnappers, and the MIA Amy Madigan is just terrific as the tough-talking McCoy, Pare's feisty sidekick.Andrew Laszlo, who worked with Hill on ""Southern Comfort"" and even shot Tobe Hooper's ""The Funhouse"", does a knockout job with the cinematography and, working with ace production designer John Vallone (another Hill reg) creates a magnificent retro universe on the Universal backlot.Not to be missed!",Streets of Fire

Anti hero Tom Cody, ex-soldier and rough and tumble outlaw comes home to rescue his ex girlfriend who has been kidnapped by the leader of a notorious motorcycle gang The Bombers.

43,a_chinn,"Flawed but memorable visual style, supporting cast, and action sequences make it worth revisiting",8,29 May 2018,"A box office bomb at the time of it's release, and as flawed of a film as it is, it's one that's always stuck with me. With the subtitle ""A Rock & Roll Fable,"" this film tells the story of singer Diane Lane returning to her hometown for one performance, only to be kidnapped by Willem Defoe's biker gang. That's when Deborah Van Valkenburgh sends a wire to Lane's old flame, her brother, Michael Pare as Tom Cody, a mercenary for hire, shows up from parts unknown to rescue her. It's the type of stripped down, no-nonsense story that writer/director Walter Hill (""The Driver,"" ""Southern Comfort,"" ""Undisputed,"" etc.) excelles at, but what made this film so memorable for me was stylized setting and genre mashup, mixing elements of action, musical, and juvenile delinquent films. I remember Hill saying he was trying to make the type of film he would have loved at a kid. The film features cars, fashions, music, and locations that look straight out of ""Blackboard Jungle"" or ""The Cool and the Crazy,"" but with a neon soaked 1980s twist. In many ways, ""Streets of Fire"" feels like a stylized extension of Hill's earlier film ""The Warriors,"" which at once felt gritty and realistic while also had an unreal aspect to it. ""Streets of Fire"" takes the visual stylistics of ""The Warriors"" to the next level, but instead of a Homeric Odyssey, this film is more of a fairy tale with greasers. 18-year old Diane Lane, in what was probably her first glamorous adult role, is amazing as Ellen Aim. She's strong, gorgeous, and overcomes Hill's usual misogyny. Her singing had to be dubbed, but she looks great on stage during the musical numbers. Incidentally, Stevie Nicks wrote all of the Ellen Aims songs. The villain of the picture, Willem Dafoe as biker gang leader Raven Shaddock, without question steals the movie and every scene he's in. At this point in his career, Dafoe was a complete unknown and his only lead role was Katherine Bigelow's little seen ""The Loveless"" (where he also played a bike gang leader), but it's so clear from his performance, even when playing what's essentially a comic book villain, he's a talent to be reckoned with. It's also a lot of fun that Dafoe's sidekick/number two/lead henchmen is played by Lee Ving, the harsh voiced lead singer for the seminal punk band FEAR. There's also a early appearance by Robert Townsend as a backup singer. Which brings us to the films major weakness, which is a laconic and lifeless performance by Michael Pare in the lead. Pare looks the part, tall, dark, handsome, but lacks the charisma to pull off a hero the film needed. When we needed a Steve McQueen or a James Dean, we end up with a Tab Hunter or a Troy Donahue. Pare is not terrible, but he's not what the film needed. Still, the music, the 50s/80s production design, the strong cast (minus Pare), and that awesome climactic sledgehammer fight are terrific and enough to make this film something of a minor classic in my mind. Overall, this hybrid musical/comic book/1950s juvenile diligent picture/action film somehow manages to overcome it's shortcomings to remain worth watching and deserving of cult status. And if you needed to know, as I finish writing this review, I now have ""I Can Dream About You"" stuck in my head. FUN FACT! A low budget unofficial sequel called ""Road to Hell"" was made in 2008 with Pare not as Tom Cody, but as Cody, and Valkenburgh playing ""Sister,"" and the Ellen Aim character now called Ellen Dream. Hill has no involvement in this spiritual sequel, but he had originally planned for there being a series of Tom Cody stories (a plan that was scuttled after the film's disappointing box office returns).",Streets of Fire

45,Samiam3,"A pretty good, eighties b-movie, following in the Warriors footsteps.",7,5 June 2010,"After I got a taste of The Warriors, I was very much drawn to try this film. Once again, director Walter Hill gives us a tale of youth rage, pulpy Americana, and rough street fighting. Streets of Fire takes the adrenaline up a notch from the Warriors, and there is a bit more story to it, but this one feels slightly inferior, because...well it's not as unique. It's still good thoughWhile doing a gig in the town of (well it is never named) Rock Star Ellen Aim is kidnapped by the local biker gang. Her old boyfriend Cody (now a lone rambler) teams up with her current boyfriend (and manager), and an ex-army chick to bring her back.the initial problem with Streets of Fire, is that it feels too short. What I have just described sums up about the first half (give or take). The remainder of the film feels staged, pointless, and muddled, although it does have something in the way of a payoff, which is good. If the rescue story portion of the film was a bit more extensive, it might have helped.It is not easy to classify Streets of Fire, if you ask me. It begins and ends like a rock video (and the music is pretty strong), but during the seventy odd minutes in between, it could be a buddy film one moment, or a gang-banger action the next. Michael Paré makes a very good lead, yet he doesn't have much to say to anyone around him. Diane Lane needed a bigger part. The character she is trying to pull off is too hard to do when the script gives you ten lines maximum.There is certainly room for improvement, but in the end, I enjoyed what I saw, and I guess I'm glad I saw it. If you dig the Warriors, this is another film to check out.",Streets of Fire
46,PredragReviews,Tonight Is What It Means To Be Young!!!,8,8 May 2016,"Hill has created a complete world here. The story takes place in a city that is so huge a wanderer (such as Amy Madigan's or Michael Pare's characters) can pass through a ""district"" the way an old west drifter would pass through a town (not the only similarity to westerns this movie has). One can drive all night, passing through several of these districts, each with their own distinctive character, without finding the end of it. There is a run-down residential area, a nightlife strip, a spooky industrial area, even a southern style district with racist cops! The character of these districts is expressed everywhere, from the production design to the music to the costumes, so you can really catch the flavor of it. I felt that the costumes especially should be commended (hello, academy), not only because they were well produced and looked good, but also each costume expressed the character of the people wearing them and the district they resided in.The main action of the movie follows the pattern of a less serious version of ""The Warriors"": our heroes must find their way home against great odds. They must take trains, steal cars, fight cops, and hide from their pursuers. Instead of the run-down griminess of a city on the edge of collapse, however, there is the sense of urgent vibrancy of a thriving culture.The music was phenomenal! It's one of my favorite soundtracks of all time due to it's great range of different styles and time periods of various genres that work incredibly well together (musical cohesiveness?). You have the Broadway-esque Steinem production of Nowhere Fast and Tonight Is What It Means To Be Young. The country pop-rock flavored ballad tune It'll Never Be You. The late Dan Hartman's sadly enough only huge pop/R&B/Motown-like hit I Can Dream About You. The lyrics are astoundingly evocative and hyperbolic...yet identifiable. If you have the opportunity, I highly recommend that you pick up this album. If the two Fire, Inc. songs had been written for a stronger movie or even a play, I guarantee they would have taken off.Overall rating: 8 out of 10.",Streets of Fire
47,Gislef,Rock and Roll Fantasy,9,13 January 1999,"Streets of Fire is very difficult to place:  it's an oddball production from Walter Hill, and it's not that different from many of his buddy-type crime movies like 48 Hours.  Where it's actually one of his better films is in the great soundtrack:  starting with the hard-driving Nowhere Fast, through love ballads, torch songs, the popular I Can Dream About You, and wrapping up with Tonight is What It Means...  The movie also works because of the oddball casting (Rick Moranis in a serious role, Amy Madigan as a female mercenary, Willem Defoe as the bad guy), and Hills' trademark choreographed, almost balletic violence (the opening fight scene between McCoy and the tough in the cafe is a good example, as is the final fight between McCoy and Raven).  It's a great movie, though, and doesn't go for the easy route anywhere through the line.  Where it's set in time and place is anyone's idea, but it doesn't really matter.

""The queen of the hop (Diane Lane) is kidnapped by the ""Leader of the pack"" (Willem Dafoe) and Soldier Boy (Michael Pare) tries to rescue her."" Ah yes Streets Of Fire, I unfortunately missed this in theaters as I did plan to see it but never got around to it however I did later see it on VHS and thought that it was a lot like Flash Gordon and Highlander in that it showed how extreme style can sometimes win out over substance, everything about this movie stylized and made to give off a coolness factor. This is an important artifact of the 80's since this is what represents a product made for an 80's audience. This is a movie that to really fully appreciate you had to have lived in the 80's. To the casual eye Streets Of Fire is a decent action flick with a 50's back-beat with cheesy songs but in the 80's this was exactly what defined it. Flashly colors, leather jackets, slicked back hair, women who were okay with going nowhere as long as it was fast and no substance at all to be found. The movie itself is an enjoyable effort although Lane seems a bit too young to be a rock star. Dafore and Pare are generally solid although the one who really steals the show is Amy Madigan. The fight sequences are of course exciting and like I said the movie works on eye candy level but the real reason I give it three stars is because this movie as well as Breakfast Club and St Elmo's Fire defined the 80's.* * * out of 4-(Good)",Streets of Fire
49,dglink,"Slick, Entertaining Feature-Length Music Video",8,15 July 2006,"Ostensibly a teen gang flick, ""Streets of Fire"" is at its core a laconic western that has been staged in a timeless unnamed town and enhanced with a pulsing rock score and flashy editing. The film is mostly glossy style, but what great style it is.A gang of leather-clad motorcyclists kidnaps a rock star, Ellen Aim, during a stage performance. Enter the tall, handsome loner with a perfect western moniker, Tom Cody. Cody accepts the bounty offered by Ellen's manager to rescue her, and, with a tough female sidekick, he rides or rather drives off to the gang's hideout in pursuit of the girl, with whom he has history. If the film were set in the 1880s, John Wayne would have played Cody and Maureen O'Hara would be Ellen. However, director Walter Hill has substituted motorcycles and retro cars for horses, although the rifles remain. Elevated trains stand in for stagecoaches, and a diner and bar serve the social functions of the old saloon. The terse dialog is as sparse as Gary Cooper's lines in ""High Noon."" The rescue echoes ""The Searchers,"" and Cody himself is like Clint Eastwood's man with no name in Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns.Michael Pare has the looks and presence of a western hero. His flat delivery at times sounds as though he studied under John Wayne. Diane Lane, while lovely, has little to do but mouth the words to Jim Steinman's pumped up songs. Willem Dafoe, on the other hand, has a face that reeks of evil and makes an excellent bad guy, while Amy Madigan is effective as the hardened, sexually ambiguous sidekick. However, ""Streets of Fire"" is not about character development and acting. The film is about art direction, sound, and editing that create what is essentially a feature-length music video. This is not a criticism, because this music video is slickly filmed, highly intoxicating, and seductively entertaining.",Streets of Fire

Tom's only help - Billy Fish (Rick Moranis), Ellen's mean spirited jerk of a manager/current boyfriend, and a mouthy ex-soldier named McCoy (Amy Madigan).With its title inspired by a Bruce Springsteen song, ""Streets of Fire"" was meant to be the first in a trilogy of films based around the character of Tom Cody, whom director Walter Hill had apparently hoped to mold into the Man With No Name for the 1980s. Unfortunately, released in the same year that saw such blockbuster hits as Beverly Hills Cop, Indiana Jones & The Temple of Doom, and Ghostbusters, ""Streets of Fire"" received very little attention from audiences, and was apparently not well liked by critics either, and did poorly at the box office. In the long run, Diane Lane eventually rebounded and has been especially popular in more recent years, while pretty much all the supporting cast members (including Bill Paxton) continued to work steadily over the years. Sadly, the film's leading man, Michael Pare, never rebounded and spent most of his career making low grade B-pictures. A tragic waste of a fine actor who could have been a star.As for the film itself, it's very entertaining in a style over substance sort of way. The plot is paper thin and so are pretty much all the characters (Tom Cody definitely doesn't have the same compelling aura around him that mystery man Eddie Wilson, Paren's character of ""Eddie & The Cruisers"" had; presumably he would evolved as a character had there been sequels, but that of course did not happen), but the stylish atmosphere, engaging action scenes and pulsating soundtrack are the real stars of the film, and there's a prevalent tongue-in-cheek sense of humor that suggests the film is meant to be a parody of itself anyway. Overall, a solid 7. Even if you don't buy the movie, you should at least buy the soundtrack.",Streets of Fire
51,Vivekmaru45,100% Rock n Roll 0% Action.,5,9 September 2014,"80's nostalgia. These were the films of my youth: pure imagination, fantasy, romance and adventure. You cannot imagine what movies meant to us. Those days they were the only entertainment available. A visit to the video rental shop was the highlight to an otherwise dull life.In the film's opening credits we see Streets Of Fire: A Rock And Roll Fable. This means that you'll see some rock n roll numbers being performed at various points in the film. This film was promoted as a summer blockbuster but it failed. Walter Hill has directed some good films: Hard Times, 48 Hrs, Red Heat, Johnny Handsome. He has written scripts for films like: Aliens, Alien 3, The Warriors. So I was expecting this film to be good plot-wise.The film stars B-actor Michael Paré, Oscar Winner Diane Lane, Willem Dafoe, Bill Paxton and Rick Moranis. From the above ill assorted cast, you sense that the movie is doomed already. Rick Moranis is only effective in comedic roles and does not suit this film. Bill Paxton is given a very small role in the film and his talent is wasted. Michael Pare has very limited amount of action sequences in the film compared to films like Die Hard and Commando. Okay, I understand that this film was targeting summer teens. But teens like action and it is here that the film is sorely lacking. The romance in the film is also mediocre. Lane's character is that of a stone-cold queen of rock who only lives for her art. Paré's character is more of an understanding type and one who is willing to sacrifice for others. Willem Dafoe is equally unconvincing as a villain. Rick Moranis just does his job and collects his paycheck.Plot of the film: In an unnamed city, Ellen Aim (Lane), lead singer of Ellen Aim and The Attackers, has returned home to give a concert. The Bombers, a biker gang, led by Raven Shaddock (Dafoe), enter the auditorium and kidnap her.Witnessing all of this is Reva Cody (Van Valkenburgh), who wires her brother Tom Cody (Paré), an ex-soldier and Ellen's ex-boyfriend, to rescue her.Watch the film to find out what happens next.Verdict: If you are a 80's B-movies fan and a fan of Michael Paré, then this one is for you.",Streets of Fire

53,witster18,"two cheesy 80's video montages pull this 9 down to 7, but this is a high style, original flick worth your time.",7,1 May 2012,"If they pulled two video montage's out of this - this could be as high as a 9, and might be one of the best original films of the last 3 decades.One of those scenes happens when Cody(Pare') reminisces about Ellen Aim just before committing to go save her - another happens later in the film after the group leaves ""the battery"". Both come off as extremely cheesy 80's music videos. The rest of the film, and the rest of the music, is great.The other 75 minutes runs at 7000RPM. The opening scene of the film is just one of many well-edited and shot action sequences with loads of style and fantastic music from Ry Cooder. The final fight scene of the film caps it off. It's one of the best fight sequences ever made! The movie flies by, and may never be fully appreciated by future generations because of the two scenes that don't help it hold-up; and because it's rarely ran on cable.This one is slowly but surely growing into a bit of cult-status by fans of 80's movies like myself. This is yet another 80's film that may get the remake treatment down the road.A weird film that seems to create it's own subculture while not being able to escape the subculture of the 80's at the same time. They just don't make them like this anymore. For 75 to 80 minutes of the film - I mean that in as positive of a way as possible. For the other 10 minutes - I mean that in a really cheesy 80's could have done without those moments kind of way.Streets of Fire was a blast on the big-screen, and has moments of sheer brilliance. The city scapes(looks like it was shot in Chicago in the 50's) and the pacing delivered by Walter Hill make this the unique ""Rock and Roll Fable"" that it proclaims to be.73/100You'll like this if you liked: Purple Rain, Red Dawn, Deuces Wild, At Close Range, and Miracle Mile.

Diane Lane is solid and I really liked Willem DaFoe's performance as the heavy.

Whether it works or not is a bit of a contentious issue among audiences, but I thought it was great. If nothing else, it's creative and stylistic. If you were expecting a straightforward movie, I can understand how you might be disappointed by the kind of unfocused, manic creativity. The movie intentionally refuses to settle down on a single tone or genre. It amazes me that some people take it incredibly seriously, saying that it's unintentionally funny or that it's not a comedy. I can't even comprehend how you could think that.If you like surreal, comic bookish movies, such as The Warriors, Buckaroo Banzai, and Big Trouble in Little China, I highly recommend you try Streets of Fire.

60,jcbutthead86,"An Excellent,Stylish Action-Musical And Cult Classic. One of Walter Hill's Best.",10,16 June 2012,"Streets Of Fire is an excellent,stylish underrated film that combines Action,Rock N'Roll,Humor,and Adventure. Although the film wasn't a box office hit,Streets Of Fire has become a Cult Favorite over the years and is one of Walter Hill's best films and is also one of my favorite movies.Set in Another Time and Another Place,Streets Of Fire tells the story of a rock star named Ellen Aim(Diane Lane)who returns to her home town the Richmond to perform a concert. While there,a gang named the bombers led by Raven Shaddock(Willem Dafoe) kidnap Ellen Aim and have captured. Ellen's ex-boyfriend and soldier Tom Cody(Michael Pare) returns to the Richmond and is hired to get Ellen back. With the help of Ellen's boyfriend/manager Billy Fish(Rick Moranis) and tough as nails McCoy(Amy Madigan),the three head into a world where Rock N'Roll is king and the only law is a loaded gun.Streets Of Fire is a movie that's great and works so well because of the setting,characters and where style wins over substance. The setting and time period of Streets Of Fire is unique because the film gives us a timeless world mixing the 50s,60s and 80s where Rock N'Roll is dominant and all over the place,a world where your not sure what year it's in. Is it the future? Is it the past? A combination of both? Or is it somewhere in between the past and the future. That's one of the great things that makes this movie work is because we'll never know the answer to those questions. The characters in the film are well-drawn and memorable because of the dialog. The dialog is stylized,over the top and spoken with the in a tough and aggressive way that wouldn't fit in the modern world,but in the world of the 30s,40s and 50s and would also fit in the very strange,weird and surreal world that SOF sets up and shows. The Humor works well in the film because most of the dialog or lines are not always spoken in complete sentences,but with one-liners,insults and reactions. The situations and style of the film build up the humor,where you don't always see the characters smile or tell or joke,but you know in the back of the characters minds and your mind that the laughs work as the film goes along. While the film is more about style than character development,you get to know a little bit about the characters Tom Cody,Ellen Aim and McCoy,who they are,why they do the things they do and their motivations in some of the events of the film. The three characters are stylized but also human and likable. The Action and fight scenes are well done and fit in with the film's bigger than life,over the top style with thrilling gunfights,explosions and fist fights. Hill knows and breathes Action. Walter Hill has always said that every film he's made is a Western and it's evident in this film. SOF is almost a retelling of the John Ford/John Wayne classic The Searchers in which a young girl is kidnapped by Indians and the John Wayne character searches for her. The Western influence is still here with the character Tom Cody being a Clint Eastwood/John Wayne cowboy in the big city and the Bombers as Indians and Ellen Aim as the kidnapped girl. SOF doesn't have dust,dirt,horses or large stagecoaches that are often associated with the great Western genre,but you'll notice the influence with repeated viewings. The is beautiful and visually stunning to look with the neon colors,production designs and photography that just comes off the screen and hits you in the eye. The film is like a comic book coming to life and the movie brings into it's own world and makes you feel like you're in the film. Maybe the only film that I can compare with in terms of visuals,style and timelessness is the movie Sin City,but Streets Of Fire is a unique,visually stunning film on it's own and one of the reasons why I love the film so much. The ending is excellent and stylish and is filled with great Rock N'Roll brilliance that will have viewers cheering and smiling. An amazing music-packed ending. The cast does a wonderful job in their roles. Michael Pare does a excellent job as Tom Cody,a tough guy who fights,shoots and asks questions later. Diane Lane is amazing as Ellen Aim and has great scenes with Pare. Rick Moranis is fantastic as Billy Fish,Ellen's jerk boyfriend and manager. Amy Madigan is brilliant as Tom's tough female sidekick McCoy,with Madigan saying great one-liners and not taking any crap. Willam Dafoe is terrific as villain Raven Shaddocks,leader of The Bombers. Richard Lawson does a great job as officer Ed Price,a local cop. Elizabeth Daily is wonderful in her small role as Baby Doll,a girl that's a fan of Ellen Aim. Deborah Van Valkenberg(Reva Cody),Stoney Jackson(Bird,The Sorels),Lee Ving(Greer)and Rick Rossovich(Officer Cooley)give good performances as well. Also,lookout for early roles with Bill Paxton(Clyde),Robert Townsend(Lester,The Sorels),Mikelti Williamson(B.J.,The Sorels),Grand L. Bush(Reggie,The Sorels)and Ed Begley Jr.(Ben Gunn)The direction by Walter Hill is brilliant and stylish,with Hill always moving the camera giving the film a wonderful pace and bringing a unique visual style to the film and also does a great job with the Action and fight scenes. Amazing direction,Hill. The score by Ry Cooder is amazing,with Cooder's score bringing Rock N'Roll,excitement and grit. Great score by Cooder. The film has a fantastic soundtrack with songs by Fire Inc.(Nowhere Fast,Tonight Is What It Mean To Be Young),Laurie Sargent(Sorcerer),The Blasters(One Bad Stud,Blue Shadows)Winston Ford(I can dream about you,Countdown To Love)and The Fixx(Deeper And Deeper). A fantastic and memorable soundtrack.In final word,if you love Walter Hill,Action films,Musicals,Cult Films or Cult films like Big Trouble In Little China,Repo Man and The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai,I Highly suggest you check out Streets Of Fire an excellent,underrated film that you can watch again and again and is one of Walter Hill's best films.

The cinematography and Ry Cooder's dynamic musical score are the key parts that make this Walter Hill film work. Pare has some nice one liners and doesn't show any anger, but makes it up with his patientence in a solid performance. Also, Pare and Lane add a nice chemistry to the film.

63,Aly200,An Underrated Goodie from Walter Hill,5,3 February 2017,"While Walter Hill is mostly known for his 1979 cult classic ""The Warriors"", the director does deliver an entertaining follow-up and more rock and roll- inspired tale of a former Army vet who goes to rescue his former lover from a biker gang with the help of an oddball cast of characters. The film's acting is not the greatest, but is not horrendously unwatchable. Michael Pare is the film's hero, Tom Cody, a bad boy from the wrong side of the tracks who is called back to New York by his sister when his ex- girlfriend is kidnapped by a local gang. Pare is not too convincing as the good guy as his line delivery falls flat and seems to want to be the bad boy by trying too hard to sound tough. His chemistry with fellow actors, Amy Madigan, Diane Lane and Rick Moranis range from relatively interesting with Madigan's McCoy to lackluster romance with Lane's Ellen Aim and downright dislike through the whole film with Moranis (it was publicly acknowledged by the other actors and crew that Rick Moranis was not a pleasure to work with on the film). Actress Diane Lane is sadly reduced to a minor role as singer Ellen Aim, the damsel in need of rescue. The actress is not terrible, but she is uninteresting and given little exposition as to where she is from and how she became famous, but luckily we know that Ellen and Tom's past history and why they are stand-offish with each other. Lane would be nominated for a Razzie, but didn't win and her career has given her better roles where Lane has played stronger females.Playing Ellen's manager and current lover (which is gone by the time she is rescued by Tom, McCoy and her manager), Billy Fish, is a woefully miscast Rick Moranis. The comedian is out of his element as he is mostly frustrating and annoying displaying a bad attitude throughout the film. Moranis claimed he didn't enjoy filming since he was not allowed to improvise on-set, but to be make a point the film is not a comedy, it's an action-drama. If an actor who was better suited to playing this role in an action setting, maybe the Billy Fish character would've had more substance, but it doesn't mesh with Moranis's unenthusiastic performance. Amy Madigan is a highlight of the film as the street-smart and gung-ho sidekick, McCoy. Originally written as a male character who would not been nearly as tough, when Madigan auditioned for the role of Reva Cody (losing out on the part) she did convince director Walter Hill to re-write McCoy as a female, which paid off. McCoy is a fun character that can hold her own and spouts sharp quips all with an attitude that sets her apart from the rest of the group. A special mention of a good acting debut goes out to Willem Dafoe who plays the film's villain, Raven Shaddock. While the Wisconsin-born native had minor roles in other films prior to ""Streets of Fire"" the future A-lister made his significant leading man debut in this action-drama. While we never get to know much about Raven or his background, Dafoe immediately makes an impression as he oozes a sinister yet charmingly vicious biker's persona. The actor is equal parts charismatic and dangerous as he calculates each move to take down the ragtag heroes and reclaim his prize after Ellen is rescued from Raven's clutches.The script is trademark for a Walter Hill film with original characters, a fun though at times silly story and a fable-like quality. While rife with clichés a plenty such as the pretty girl needs rescuing by her former boyfriend and a climactic showdown before the hero and villain, the narrative does a sense of fun and maintains a popcorn action-drama vibe that will hold interest. The cinematography of New York is not nearly as expansive as Hill shot ""The Warriors"" which went all over the city, but the limited locales the director uses keeps the city as a character just like his cult classic.Overall a fun action romp that will appeal to anyone.",Streets of Fire

That's not to say there isn't anything to enjoy, Michael Pare is well suited to the part, Dafoe is a fun villain , Diane Lane is cute and (of course) the action scenes are well handled and have a lot of punch to them. So this is a good effort from Hill, who adds excellent cinematography and creates a mood which convinces you that this does take place in another time and another place.

67,rparham,"Don't put out this ""Fire""",7,31 October 2006,"Streets of Fire identifies itself on screen as ""A Rock 'N Roll Fable"" and that is about as apt a description as you will get for this film. While ostensibly an action film, rock n' roll is a key component to the plot, as one of the lead characters is the lead singer of a hit rock band, and several scenes in the film are rock concerts, photographed as if you were watching a concert film. The fable also fits, as Streets of Fire is an amalgam of multiple time periods and locations, taking place in its own alternate reality. Streets of Fire is not a great film by most anyone's standard, but it is an effective action yarn that looks good, hits the right beats and is relatively entertaining.Streets of Fire opens in the Richmond District of an unnamed city. The rock star Ellen Aim (Diane Lane) is performing in her own home town, but before the show is over, Raven (Willem Dafoe), leader of the motorcycle gang the Bombers, kidnaps her off stage. A local diner owner, Reva (Deborah Van Valkenburg), contacts her brother Tom Cody (Michael Pare), who was Ellen's old flame, and pleads for him to return home to try and save Ellen from Raven. With Ellen's current boyfriend, and manager, Billy Fish (Rick Moranis) and a soldier for hire, McCoy (Amy Madigan), in tow, Tom heads off to the Battery district, the Bomber's home turf, and manages to rescue Ellen, but the return trip to the Richmond District is just as fraught with danger, as Tom must avoid the Bombers and the police, and try to rekindle his relationship with Ellen.Streets of Fire is hardly a deep film, it is very much a straightforward action picture, but many of the details make it memorable. The production design by John Vallone creates a world that is not specific to any particular era. The vehicles and many of the buildings have a distinct '50's feel, yet there are television sets, modern rock music and other trappings that suggest a more modern setting as well. Streets of Fire is interested in creating a surrealistic look, and it succeeds. The cinematography, by Andrew Laszlo, is also very impressive, with most of the film unfolding at night, and the mix of colors and atmosphere is arresting.Many of the intrinsic themes are very much in the vein of any film made by its director, Walter Hill. This is very much a film about male characters, living in a very macho world and very rarely deviating from that male posturing. Even one of the key female characters, McCoy, is more man than woman, proving to be tough as nails. It is also easy to see that even at this stage in his career, before Hill became largely a Western director, he was already molding his films around a Western archetype. Many of the basic setups and characters are very much in the Western vein: the loner hero brought in to save the damsel in distress from the ruthless outlaws; the ineffectiveness of the local police to handle the situation; and finally, as befits any Western, a showdown between hero and villain. While it would be a few years still before Hill managed an actual Western, it would seem that his heart was already there.If much of the basis of the film feels like a Western, then the dialogue is very much steeped in the '50s. However, as delivered by the actors, it ends up coming across a bit stiff and unrealistic. Acting is one of the film's weaker points, as almost no one in Streets of Fire give a standout performance. Michael Pare, a relative unknown, in his first major lead, is relatively unimpressive, delivering his lines rather stiltedly and sounding at times like he is reading cue cards. Moranis, mostly a comedian, is also weak as Billy Fish. He does a good job of delivering his rapid fire dialogue, but almost none of it comes across other than words that were written down that he then needs to recite. There is little naturalistic flow to the speech in Streets of Fire, perhaps the actor's had a hard time wrapping their mouths around the anachronistic words, but it fails to deliver as believable. Dafoe, as Raven, is reasonably good as the villain, but he is not given enough screen time to really flesh out his character.All that said, the film looks great, moves rather briskly, has some nice action sequences, including one standout fight and the rock concert scenes are well-staged and the music for those scenes isn't too bad either. Sometimes, a movie is just there to look good, provide a reasonably enjoyable two hours and not much else.",Streets of Fire

71,bannonanthony,Tonight Is What It Means To Be Young,8,21 December 2004,"This film is another example of Mr. Walter Hill delivering the goods with a great story, great visuals and great action. The performances are pretty good, although our star Michael Pare is a bit one-note. It doesn't help that Tom Cody (his character) is a bit of a jerk at times. But the mega-jerk award must go to Rick Moranis as the slimy Billy Fish. He's ultimately a good guy, but he is so snide and unlikeable that I actually said 'thank you' when Willem Dafoe's number two punches him out. That said, Moranis proves he can be good in a straight role.Willem Dafoe himself excels as biker king Raven. He has proved time and time again that he can be the best when he plays a bad guy (but what was with those leather dungarees?). Diane Lane and Amy Madigan are great as Ellen and McCoy respectively. The whole look of the film was great. The story seems to be taking place in some 50s/80s hybrid (classic muscle cars are all around, and yet 80s rock 'n roll blares on the soundtrack and neon-lit clubs show music videos on various monitors).The music by Ry Cooder and songs composed by Jim Steinman, Stevie Nicks and Tom Petty are excellent. I love how the film begins and ends with the two Steinman numbers. I was a bit disappointed when I read that Diane Lane only lip-synchs in the film because the two songs, Nowhere Fast and Tonight Is What It Means To Be Young, kick ass! I liked how down-on-their-luck crooners the Sorels are hired to be Ellen's opening act at the end. They perform the soundtracks' big hit single, I Can Dream About You (performed by Dan Hartman when it was released).The action hardly ever lets up as Cody blasts at enemy vehicles with his trusty twelve-gauge and he and Raven have a climactic final duel.I'm glad that this film has been released on DVD in the UK, but with NO extras. I really think UK DVD customers get shafted! I wish Mr. Hill would do commentaries, because I think SOF ranks up there with THE WARRIORS as one of his best. Don't miss this one!

72,jmworacle-99025,Teen Angel Kidnapped by The Leader of The Pack so Soldier Boy to the Rescue.,8,11 April 2020,"This is one of my top ten guilty pleasure movies. A lot of hokey lines, and unbelievable situations. First of all with a character such as Ellen Aime is kidnapped all hell would break out and law enforcement would be mobilized to take care of business. Second, the leaders of the Bombers would not wait for his captive to consent to get to know him in the biblical sense. Raven would've taken what he wanted and after he was finished she would have been public property for the club. When the final battle between Tom Cody and Raven is finished the authorities allow the gang to take their leader and run.However, the scene stealer is Amy Madigan's McCoy character. A no nonsense person who anyone would like to have on their side when things hit the fan. I was really blown away when I learned Diane Lane was just 18 years old at the time the movie was made. Michael Pare's Tom Cody character was good. E.J. Daley had a point about her not having a singing role. Her voice is as almost as beautiful as she is. The musical numbers were fantastic.",Streets of Fire
73,yojimbo999,"Raging Streets, Gotta Love It",10,20 April 2001,"Saw this flick when I was a baby in the '80s. I dug it. I mean, I really, REALLY dug it. So much so that I would take the time to actually plan on watching it if I saw a commercial for it. Unfortunately, I've only seen it on TV, with the commercials, and everybody knows commercials can kill a movie like this. Movies like this one depends on its brisk pacing to keep it alive, and commercials, well, just kills pacing, no matter what you're watching. The only thing commercials doesn't kill, I think, are episodic television.I've since seen this movie on cable and without commercials, and it rocks. I mean, I didn't think it could be better than it was with commercials, but damn, I was so wrong, and I've never been happier to be so wrong.The movie itself is a fantasy. People commenting on this board keeps trying to guess it's time period. Why? Do you try to guess time periods of Star Wars? Or fantasy dungeons and dragon movies? Remember, it's a FANTASY MOVIE, and even the folks behind it says so. So why would you bother to try to date it?It's a fun and lively movie. The music is pretty good, and actually stands up to the test of time. At least to me. The acting is not spectacular, but one has to remember that aside from Defoe, most of the cast were still newcomers. Pare, Lane, that nerd from the Honey I Shrunk movies, and a young Bill Paxton, once again doing the cowardly/annoying bit (hilarious!).
I plan on getting this movie on DVD. If it's cable life is better than it's TV life, then it's DVD life has GOTTA be even better. Can't wait.",Streets of Fire

He was the guy behind Meat Loaf, who carried the stigma of rock buffoon. How could we have coolnesss with both?Yet, the moment in this movie that Diane Lane (or dubbed) sings Steinman's ""Nowhere fast,"" it was clear this was a true rock and roll movie. And it is. It truly rocks.I have a few beefs. Mostly that the motorcycle club seems kind of lame. And the final duel has the very frightening weapons of ... sledgehammers? Really?

The beginning is very very 80's with a 18 year old Diane Lane in a music video of sorts but the whole movie is incredibly unique and highly stylized. The setting reminds me of Dark City, a sort of 1950's mixed with future mixed with a time and world that you can't really place. If you have seen the Warriors this movie is like that in that it has very specific gangs that have their own uniforms, like you would see in a video game.It has a young Willem Dafoe as the main villain, a young Diane Lane at 18 that already at that age had more experience acting than anyone else.

Then again, man, this is how an action should be. This film has the kind of fight scenes I like with the hero and bad guy beating each other senseless, not the you know the hero is going to win, not gritty at all, hard to fallow, Matrix trash of today. Also, this is how a musical should be done. Makes you want to get up and sing and dance.

79,med_1978,Streets Of Fire Fails to set the Screen Alight !!,4,29 March 2006,"After reading a lot of the reviews on here, and being a fan of Diane Lane I went and got this movie on video. I have to say I was disappointed, I had seen all this nonsense before.Michael Pare was basically playing a tough ex soldier who is contacted by his sister and asked to come back to the town he grew up in to rescue famous rock star & old flame Ellen Aim (Diane Lane). She is being held by the evil Raven (Willem Dafoe) who kidnapped her from on-stage at a gig, with his gang of bikers ""The Bombers"" and trashed the town centre. Our hero then finds out his ex has been living with her Manager (Rick Moranis)who agrees to pay Michael Pare to get her back, so with the assistance of another soldier (Amy Madigan) who is just passing through and needing work, he goes to get her. The story really is as straightforward as that.I found myself enjoying the scenes where Lane's character Ellen Aim is on stage and the fight sequence between Michael Pare & Willem Dafoe, also the soundtrack was very good, the moody sets were okay.On the downside however the acting was atrocious, probably due to the terrible scripting (The lines the actors were given were very cheesy), the action was predictable and routine, There were no great set-pieces to speak of and Willem Dafoe's bad guy was sorely underused. I only recently saw Harley Davidson & the Malboro Man which was not that good either but probably more entertaining than this. Diane Lane was only really there as eye candy and didn't really have much to do in the film.If you are in the mood for something easy to follow, and quite shallow then this film is fine it passes the time fairly quickly. But honestly if you did not see this film, you would not be missing out on anything.

If you're gonna make a rock 'n' roll fable you gotta include the rock 'n' roll. And the music, save for two songs by the Blasters, is gutless, assembly line, pro forma pop--not rock, music. And though a lip synching Diane Lane is gorgeous, she's grossly miscast as a rock singer in a day when women were making a strong comeback in rock. Imagine Joan Jett,Cyndi Lauper, Lita Ford or Pat Benatar in the role while doing their own singing and you can see how bad the casting is. Michael Pare is a solid action lead, Amy Madigan is a fine sidekick to him and Willem Dafoe has one of the great debuts in film. (The less said about Rick Moranis the better. He's as annoying as static on a radio you can't reach.)On a side note, if the moves of the Torchie's dancer seem familiar, that's Marine Jahan and she did all of Jennifer Beals' dancing in Flashdance. Visually the movie's fun and Ry Cooder's background music is atmospheric in an ersatz Ennio Morricone way, but ultimately it doesn't come together well enough to be truly memorable.

Though it plays like a B movie there's nothing cheap about it. I'd forgotten about it being a who's-who of journeymen on the way up, from Dafoe to Madigan to Robert Townsend.

Join this lush photography that gives great strength to the film. Michael Paré has a great interpretation. Regret is that it was a star who promised a lot and did not have the career that was expected. The gorgeous Diane Lane is at the peak of its beauty, no doubt.

Ellen's manager Billy, Rick Moranis, hires mercenary Tom Cody, Michael Pare, to rescue her and he is accompanied by ex-soldier McCoy, Amy Madigan. Did I mention Tom is Ellen's ex-boyfriend?This is a film of 50's greasers set on an 80's backdrop. Fabulous set design and overall aesthetic make you feel like you're in the crowd or walking the streets. Moranis is excellent as the obnoxious manager and Dafoe has a cool demeanor ready to burst.Our lead is a bit one dimensional and feels like a watered down Frank Castle, but that's something easy to get over. Some parts feel forced and shoved in just to get a scene in, but once again, not a deal breaker.With a classic 80's cast and a 93 minute runtime, this is the perfect film to get behind.

Paxton is funny in a small role, Dafoe is pure evil and Diane Lane is hotter than hot as the sexy leading lady! If you love fun movies this is for you, if you love dumb action movies then this is for you, and if you're a fan of Diane Lane, then she has never looked better.

They almost break into a tap-dancing scene, but don't.Naturally, the police are hopeless, so the current boyfriend (her manager) hires the ex-boyfriend to go rescue her for $10,000, because of course you do. Note, he only gets hired after her sister gets him back in town, which she does by WRITING HIM A LETTER. HOW LONG WAS THIS GIRL IN CAPTIVITY FOR?Armed with a shotgun that's accurate as a sniper rifle, he takes out the gang and rescues her, and naturally they all head back to the exact same place where she got kidnapped, because the gang, who are hunting them, will never suspect that. They almost break out in song, but don't.But the ex doesn't want her in harms way when the bikers come for revenge, so he punches her in the face knocking her out, because of course that's what you do, and tells the sidekick to get her out of town.The biker gang turn up for revenge, so it's a one-on-one fight between the ex and the biker leader. 3 minutes later the girl turns up, so what was the point in punching her in the face? The perfect time for the big dance number, but it got cut.She wants to get back with the ex but he thinks the emotionally abusive band manager is better for her, so he leaves.

Evidently an alternate reality earth is the setting for this picture which was made during the MTV music video's are where it's at, craze. A Pat Benatar like singer is nabbed by a bunch of leather boys who are supposed to be straight but after seeing Willem Dafoe, the leader,in his patent leather waders, I am not so sure. Plus, he is wearing way too much make-up. Enter said singer's ex, Cody, embodied by Michael Pare', as a sort of poor man's Sylvester Stallone. He looks like a country bumpkin but kicks ass like, well, Rambo. The singer's snotty little manager/boyfriend, Rick Moranis has hired Cody to get back his meal ticket/main squeeze. Rick Moranis' character is really annoying and I can't understand why he didn't get the s--t beaten out of him more often. Cody falls in with a tough ex-soldier who just happens to be a chick of ambiguous sexual preference. Ex-boyfriend, manager and mercenary head to the bad part of town to rescue the singer. Actually, the whole town looks pretty bad. The singer gets rescued with no problem which leads to a showdown with Cody and Raven, Willem Dafoe. They fight with sledge hammers, which is different. Naturally, Cody trounces Raven. The movie ends with another concert of Pat Benatar music except the singer is much better looking than Pat Benatar. Some interesting and cool stuff going on here. All the cars are vintage 40's and 50's. but I saw a modern color TV. A whole lot of guns were displayed and the rifles seemed to be all Winchester lever actions. Even the cops had Winchesters. Bill Paxton is in this and is wasted as a hapless bartender who gets punched out by Amy Madigan's butch merc. Deborah Van Valkenburgh is also wasted as Cody's sister. Why didn't the powers that be make E.G.Daily the singer/love interest? She actually can sing. Diane Lane,who played damsel in distress, Ellen Aim, had her singing dubbed. Daily was adorable. Her character's name was even Baby Doll. There is a stripper in the biker's hangout that I thought for sure was a dude at first, so the ambiguity continues. The dialog was forced or something, it sounded made up. Much was made of the music. It was after all a ""rock and roll fable"". My favorite song was at the end of the credits and was by The Fixx.

Each actor is utilized in such a manner as to showcase their strengths. There are lots of early glimpses of superstars yet to blossom. The mood shifts are well executed to keep up the momentum. All in all, it is a lot of fun. Turn up the volume!The use of timeless 50s based atmosphere and creative costuming will delight viewers as will several of the action scenes. The dialog between Moranis and Pare has several remarkable moments as does the slow building tension between Pare and Dafoe. There is a artistic use of a comic like story board feeling throughout that really works. At first glance this work may appear simple, but after several viewings it becomes apparent that it took some real imagination and teamwork to pull this together.

The indefinate or intentionally ambiguous placement both geographically and time wise. The displaced Cowboy Cody Character straight out of a John Wayne Western. The delightful maliciousness of William Dafoe and loads of loud bikes and leather and Rock and Roll make this a cinematic monument to the excess of the 80's that hasn't dated near as much as its counterpart movies of the decade, indeed it hasn't dated at all.Rock on...",Streets of Fire

Sometimes it impresses me with its awfulness, but there's also a spirit of inventiveness and daring that are all too rare these days. There are some cheesy-fantastic performances from Diane Lane, Willem Dafoe (!), and Amy Madigan (!), and the sets, props, costumes, and general feel must be seen to be believed.

101,dog_fc,A freakin' classic!,10,27 February 2006,"Streets of Fire has got to be one of the best damned movies ever made and is certainly one of the best movies made in that era of classics - the 80's. I'm not sure what the hell a rock and roll fable is but this movie is it and it's GREAT! Screw animals teaching us morals, this movie has got Fire, Inc. singing on its soundtrack! What more could you ask for? This film challenges The Longest Day as the movie with the most screen-busting talents ever assembled for one director to work with. Michael Pare, Diane Lane, Rick Moranis, Willem Dafoe, and Bill Paxton (in an almost cameo) all shine as brightly as exploding motorcycles. There's never a dull moment and the music is GREAT! Walter Hill and Larry Gross are geniuses! Absolute princes of the written word. That they deigned to share this with us, we mere mortals, is proof positive that there is a God. I dare say this movie is almost as good as Commando - and that's a damn fine film.I do not exaggerate when I say that this movie set the standard for every action-adventure/musical/stoic ex-mercenary hero/villain in latex coveralls movie made ever since.Two hundred and eight stars out of ten!

102,Sigmund,Really bad,4,13 August 2000,"This movie would like to imitate ""The Warriors"" (1979), but there's no way! The problem here is with the script: all characters are uni-dimensional, and all the lines are the most predictable you could imagine: this movie is not old enough to justify such a parade of sentences we already heard hundreds of times. And the story also is predictable, eventually it is terribly boring. Not to mention the totally unlikely and unbelievable plot... Also features a lot of non-acting actors. Walter Hill disappointed me badly.",Streets of Fire

105,Iceman-15,Really liked this movie!,10,4 March 2021,"Streets of Fire was Walter Hill's first movie after the immensely popular 48hrs. It stars Michael Pare as a John Wayne'ish type character who has an irresistible combination of toughness and innocence. He's mean, but his eyes are soft. Diane Lane in the prime of her beauty plays the damsel in distress. Willem Dafoe in one of his early menacing roles is quite effective, and Rick Moranis as Lane's boyfriend appropriately handles the weasel qualities of the character. The movie is shot with style to spare, and the dialogue is sharp. But somehow the film bombed at the box office, but over the years it has developed a cult following. Which is a bit of a shame, because it was more than a cult film. Pare had true leading man qualities, and being the star, his career suffered the most. Still, it's a great effort by the talented Hill, and crew. See this movie, you won't be disappointed.",Streets of Fire
106,Falkeep,Welcome to Purgatory,8,13 October 2000,"I was in my mid-20s when this movie first came out and immediately fell in love with it.  I watched it many times and bought in on video as soon as I could so I could see it whenever I wanted to.  One of the things that struck me most about it is specifically the inability to place it in any particular place or time.  I developed a theory of my own that it takes place in Purgatory... not Heaven, not Hell but an afterlife somewhere in between and no one is evil or pure... the path they will end up following is still being determined and it is up to each person to decide for themself where they will ultimately end up.  Everyone in the film (with the exception of Matthew Laurance who was one of Walter Hill's stock players) is of the same general age... 20s - 30s... there are no children and no middle age or elderly people, and the all would come American cities from the period the 50s to the 80s.  There is law, but no evidence of government.  There is no evidence of any landscape except for urban.  None of the cars or motorcycles have any identification of any type to indicate make or model.  The money is not any of identifiable type and they never refer to it as dollars or any other specific currency, just ""ten grand"" and so on.  The cities all have generic names (the Richmond, Ardmore, Cliffside, the Bowery, etc.)  The technology is a hodge-podge of of the post-WWII period, from hand moved reostats for stage lights, to large hand mikes and neon, to telex machines, to television and video.  The music itself lends itself to this interpretation, bookcased between Jim Steinman's epics ""Tonight is What it Means to be Young"" and ""Nowhere Fast"".  Listen to the lyrics and determine that for yourselves. The dialogue is hokey... on purpose.  Walter Hill also specifically tried to capture the delivery styles of of old westerns which serves to keep the dialogue from being identifiable with any specific period that the people would have lived in.It is a shame that this movie wasn't successful enough for Hill to be able to make either of his planned sequels (SoF was intended to be the first movie of a trilogy about Tom Cody).  I would have liked to see more of this world and what Hill's complete vision of it was.  As it is, this movie is our only visit there and we have to deduce the whole from the glimpses we are allowed.  Oh well, I can dream about you.",Streets of Fire
107,Toad--,A forgotten classic. Outstanding.,9,9 December 1999,"I saw this as a restless youth, and man, did I ever wanna be Michael Pare :>this one ranks among my favourites from its decade. The cast is outstanding, and many of them were relatively unknown at the time. Rick Moranis, Amy Madigan and Willem Dafoe are all insanely great.The look of the film, as said in another comment, is surreal and timeless. It looks kind of 80's, kind of futuristic and kind of 50s, and very urban and gritty. This is the same New York from The Warriors, with slightly better shots and sets.And the music? Wow! Fire Inc's anthems sound a little bit dated today, but I love 'em. Add some doowop, some R&B from the Blasters, and in one of the most badass scenes ever filmed, Link Wray's classic ""Rumble,"" which features the most badass chord ever played.Don't pass this over if you missed it the first time around.",Streets of Fire

Elements of 1950s greater world, 60s bikers, 80s hair and fashion. It's a beautiful mess. Fun to see singers, actors who later went on to great fame, but here they are 20 and 30 year olds overacting and corny schmaltzing it up like there's no tomorrow. Its a film meant to capture Michael Pare and Diane Lane's beauty at it's freshest. Man, if Michael had been born 20 years later he would have been THE actor of this era. Ahead of his time and mis-directed. Watch it. Just put it into a cheese fantasy category and enjoy Mr. Toad's Wild Ride.Looking their perfect best in an over acted.",Streets of Fire
109,jortegasa,We need a new hero,7,3 June 2019,"Ok, lets just get this out the way, Michael Pare as an actor really sucks. Now I know that to most that isn't like earth shattering news but I just wanted to point that out because he is the worse part about this movie. Some would say that this whole movie sucks but not me. I just love this movie. How this movie tanked when it came out is understandable, it had a feel and look that was out of step with the times which really blows because this movie just rocks.Lets start out with what its all about. So we have a singer named Ellen Aim(played by Diane Lane) who is kidnaped by a gang lead by Willem Dafoe. Out to rescue Aim is one Tom Cody(played by our friend Pare). Along for the ride is Rick Moranis and Amy Madigan. Great cast right? The music kicks ass, the 50's mashup with the 80's adds a style that is unquestionably different. It's all pretty much silly fun that at times is so over the top that it's hard to keep a straight face. But i gotta keep going to the look because you are not going to find any other movie like it anywhere.It really bothers me that this movie isn't better liked or remembered by so many. It's everything that the 1980's were, over the top and crazy. Mix in the action of Walter Hill as director and it's such a fun time.I could go on and on about by the bad dialogue and bad jokes that sit alongside black leather gangs like they were made for each other. I could tell you about a lot of things but every time I watch this movie my big question always comes back. Why did it bomb. It bomb because our hero is awful. I want to always love this movie more then it should but Pare and his bad acting always gets in the way.So should you see this movie? Yes, just pretend that anyone but Pare is our hero",Streets of Fire

There's a good mix of fifties fashions with eighties neon colours, great music from the Sorels (sixties motown) and Ellen Aim (Jim Steinbeck seventies/eighties), classic cars from the fifties, and with a dark, post-apocalyptic feel to the Battery area which could suggest early next century?Don't let this confuse you.

You'll be smiling and snapping your fingers at the end so it's a good movie and worth a look. The finish is just right.This movie is clearly different. ""Another Time, Another Place"" is taken literally as you can't totally identify it with the 50's despite the familiarities. Most of the performances were right-on especially the secondary characters. The music is a real highlight. Including The Sorels plot didn't seem to fit but it turns out they were a great addition. Willem Dafoe was a great villain. The opening song was a great setup for the mood; you want to clap right along with the crowd.What struggles is the writing. There's just too many times when you roll your eyes and immediate think ""they could have done that better"". An hour and a half was probably too short as there were too many major parts that should have gone deeper.You wish that more movies would be made that take a risk and do things a little differently. The best description would be comparing it to a double hit off the wall; could have been a home run but still a solid hit.",Streets of Fire

113,Eric_Rage,"This movie rocks, literally",8,3 December 1999,"Like most Walter Hill movies, ""Streets of Fire"" has more flash than substance. And like most Hill entries, it works.Despite Michael Pare's lack of emotional range, Tom Cody makes for one of the slickest action characters of the '80s. Willem Dafoe, making his debut, is perfect as the sleazy biker Cody has to crack to free the obligatory action babe, this time played by Diane Lane.The action moves sporadically, but the thrills warrant the lulls they follow. The movie is beautifully shot by the same cinematographer Hill used in stylish action epic, ""The Warriors.""Songwriter, and frequent Meat Loaf collaborator, Jim Steinman almost manages to steal the movie. The Ellen Aim songs that bookend the movie, ""Nowhere Fast"" and ""Tonight Is What It Means To Be Young,"" are best the songs lip-synched by an actress that I can think of.",Streets of Fire
114,cynthiacher-1,Crap from the eighties,1,10 July 2010,"All the favorable, ecstatic comments about this movie must be coming from people who are for some bizarre reason are very, very nostalgic about the eighties. Because ""Streets of Fire"" is CRAP! This movie was supposed to be part of a trilogy of action films called ""The Adventures of Tom Cody."" But that didn't happen because the original flopped.The movie was promoted as a ""rock and roll fable"", whatever the hell that is. A ""rock and roll fable""...boy, that sounds stupid.Michael Pare as ""Tom Cody"" is a very bland action hero. Nothing about him suggests anything interesting or compelling to watch.Diane Lane is ""Ellen Aim."" As bland as Pare, she is also utterly unconvincing as a rock singer. But she does look good in her tight costumes, which is the reason she got the role I suppose.One critic noted that even though it's always raining nobody ever has an umbrella.The movie is rather like a long music video, kind of like ""Flashdance"", another rotten movie from the eighties. That one, equally as ludicrous as ""Streets of Fire"" was a big hit, go figure.I don't understand the fondness for bad movies from the eighties. I thought the eighties produced an incredible amount of garbage in TV, films and music. ""Streets of Fire"" is a good example of the mindless garbage that passed for entertainment back then. I'm not saying it's any better now, but the eighties is in a class by itself when it comes to worthless dreck.",Streets of Fire

That's how ""Streets of Fire"" starts, with the rockstar Ellen Aim (Diane Lane) in a concert, playing the 80's classic ""Nowhere Fast"".

Cody goes to his quest with McCoy (Amy Madigan), a lesbian-like soldier that needs money.And then we have a bunch of great action scenes, fights and rock songs to create the scenario for rebels and lovers. Of course Cody and Ellen will have a ""love affair revival"", but what choices will they made after that?Michael Pare follows the ""Keanu Reeves Way of Acting"", with just one expression all over the movie, but Diane Lane (a sex symbol), Amy Madigan and Rick Moranis (not funny here) are just perfect.Walter Hill makes his tribute to the 60's youth movies, adds Ry Cooder's rock and blues, tells the story like a comic book and with a beautiful cinematography does one of the most underrated movies of the decade.Someone could make a sequel.

Oh, and as far as it being a rock-n-roll fable, the music is terrible and should never be played again!",Streets of Fire
118,holsu,Fantastic small movie,10,12 November 2009,"Streets of Fire is a movie from my youth. I've had it on tape for several years and now finally watched my DVD-version first time.The movie tells the rock story about Ellen Aim (Diane Lane) who's been kidnapped by a gang of bikers. Ellens old love Tom Cody (Michael Paré) is sent for to come and save the girl from the villains. Together with Ellens new boyfriend/manager Billy Fish (Rick Moranis) and a postmodern cowgirl, McCoy (Amy Madigan) , Cody rescues Aim. But the bad guys aren't happy with that and there will be a final battle between Cody and the leader of the bikers pack, Raven Shaddock (Willem Dafoe).I've always loved Streets of Fire but I guess I've never understood how much there really is to like in it.It's only fair to start with Diane Lane. I'm not sure if any woman on earth ever might be as beautiful as Lane is in this movie. She just is a goddess. On top of that her acting is very good. I would say that Lane's work as Ellen Aim is the best acting ever of an actor/actress to portray a singer. The song scenes usually just doesn't work. I am very glad that Diane Lane did get a good career though playing in lots of smaller movies most of the time.Michael Paré too does good work. Probably most of the watchers would like a hotter Tom Cody but I kind of prefer Paré. I like him a lot as the righteous dude who comes and helps out when needed. His acting is plain but good.Willem Dafoe as the bad guy makes one of his best roles ever. He really is naughty and look at the hair style. Cool. His face in the ending when he realises that his gonna lose is really something.As Streets of Fire is a rock'n roll fable it of course need some good hits. The basic music in the movie (by Ry Cooder) is okay. It goes well with the story. Then again the songs by Fire Inc. are to me real classics. Tonight is what it means to be young and Nowhere fast (both written by Jim Steinman) both gives the movie such a kick. They really makes you feel good. Sad that neither ever became any major hit.On top of all is the love story between two different kind of persons. Ellen Aim wants to make it as a rock star while Tom Cody just wants to continue with his modest way of living. I'd like to think that someway they found each other in the end.",Streets of Fire

121,eagle2904,Nowhere fast,9,24 December 2005,"the tagline that best describes this movie isn't ""tonight is what it means to be young"" but ""nowhere fast"".streets of fire is surely not one of those films that require an above average IQ to understand what's going on, what's going to happen and that all this is not real, never was and never could be. it's a fairy tale from a rock'n'roll world. in short, this movie is taking you ... nowhere. but FAST! and with style. oooh, so much style.cinematography & editing are absolutely top notch. if you pay attention to detail like i do, you will find that streets of fire is a work of art, a masterpiece. the lighting during the first concert scene with ellen aim is just fantastic. one moment she's singing in front of a black wall so it seems, then a tiny little bit of background light is added and you realize she's standing in front of a huge crowd. one moment you see just the outlines of ravens head, then they add the lighting and you see his devil eyes. if you pay attention you will see that they do a lot with lights and shadows. (more shadows than lights actually, this movie is DARK).and then the music. oh my god. in combination to the movie with all its sharp cuts, colours, lights and style it still keeps me going after 20 years. ""nowhere fast"" and ""tonight is what it means to be young"" at the beginning and the end of the film make nice bookends to this ""rock'n'roll fable"", which doesn't even bother to take itself seriously. diane lane is absolutely believable as a singer and michael pare plays the no-fear-tough-guy-part flawlessly.if you haven't seen it yet just remember, you're not watching an action movie, nor a comedy, nor a drama, nor anything else you might have seen before. streets of fire pulls you into a world that can not be explained nor criticized by ordinary movie standards. this is a unique movie and my guess is, it requires a unique perspective and mindset to fully appreciate the ""art"" of this work.streets of fire is a classic and should be in every movie buff's DVD shelf.",Streets of Fire

It's not a very realistic movie either (one shot blows up a cycle?). You need to learn to deal with it, the movie wasn't made to win Oscars, it was made to be fun, and in that area, it succeeds. I loved the movie, plain and tall. The music is great, and while the story is in some ways VERY reminicant of another Walter Hill film, The Warriors, it deffinitaly does the story with its own style, one that isn't less, just different.

123,jessthomsen,A Forgettable Movie,4,2 March 2008,"Well I must say that after watching Streets of Fire directed by Walter Hill I was bit disappointed if not upset. I regard Walter Hill as a director with much more potential than to direct a B-Movie such as Streets of Fire. Remember that he has written such movies The Warriors (1979), The Getaway (1972), 48 Hrs. (1982) and not to forget Aliens (1986).My most concern with this movie is the lack of acting and a decent script. I just don't understand how Walter Hill could cast Michael Paré in the lead role as Tom Cody. Michael Paré delivers terrible bad performance as the one dimensional character Tom Cody. I admit that Paré didn't have much lines to do with, but yet I'm convinced that even if the character did have the one-liners his uncanny performance wouldn't be improved.One of the things that annoyed me was the fact that the background history did in fact resemble the theme from The Warriors (1979) meaning a violent society without any law and order. But when Cody and McCoy together with Billy Fish tries to rescue Ellen Aim and from the gangsters and McCoy confronts the their leader Raven claims they have no weapons, but they could get them if needed - Totally ridiculously. The only actor, who delivers a good performance in this movie is Rick Moranis as the agent for Diane Lane. The latter and Amy Madigan as McCoy delivers a decent acting. By the way do notice how the music by Ry Cooder really scores the theme of the movie.",Streets of Fire

I'd forgotten how incredibly entertaining a big screen spectacle it is with beautiful set design and outstanding musical numbers. I'm glad seeing the reviews that there are many who love this film as I do. Sure the actors and roles are massively clichéd, they are meant to be, who cares.

I can't say it's a great flick, tho Amy Madigan is terrific. It tries to mix up time periods for a unique look, but it screams eighties to today's eyes.I love to watch movies for the little gems, such as early performances or interesting bits of trivia, such as French actress, Marine Jahan's small role as a bar dancer at Torchy's. I recognized those 'Flashdance' moves right away! Marine was Jennifer Beals' dance double for most of that film, and both that, and Diane Lane's beauty absolutely epitomize the eighties era to me.If this movie were to be re-made today, I can really see Nathan Fillion in Pare's role.

I have to agree with MisterFahrenheit's comments about Diane Lane. She was just absolutely beautiful in this film. This movie gave Willem Defoe a big push. That face of his and a little highlighting makeup really gives him a look to remember. Unfortunately this movie didn't do the same for it's hero Michael Pare. After doing Eddie and the Cruisers, this movie should have pushed him onto the Hollywood ""A list"", but it didn't and after his next movie ""The Philadelphia Experiment"" failed to help, his career nosedived into ""B movie"" limbo, which was too bad. With Ry Cooder doing original music, along with some others bands and one hit coming out of this movie, ""I Can Dream About You"" by Dan Hartman, and some other outstanding songs which should have been pushed more, I highly recommend this movie.

129,karlonsh,An absolute highlight ! Unfortunately commiserable underrated !!,10,27 December 2007,"Hill's internationally cult- style 80's that never garnered the attention, or following, that I was sure it would. Personally, the opening is one of my favourite. It's a movie made back when PG didn't mean it had to be a kiddie film. This is an older film, but it holds up very well. It has the typical 80's look to it with plenty of soft colors and a bit of a washed out appearance, but in detail holds up pretty well. Also it looks like another Hill film ""The Warriors"", because it has almost the same location with the dark clime. Apart from the laughable dialog it is a great, colorful, neon & moody lightning movie. A mix of wild & benign great rock & roll action makes this movie to a huge bomb in its days as yet. A brilliant movie throughout. The Soundtrack is purely magnificent 80's all the way. Lots of electric drums and synths to keep things lively and the main soundstage is nice & open. Dynamics are pretty well for the age of the film. If you like the film, as I do, then the HDDVD is an easy purchase. If you are unsure, well it's less $20 but appreciation of the film will be paramount to your dollar value and it's the best rendition of it so far, so you can impress your friends with your system although the opening might be a cool way to show them your audio.

Bad guys roll into town and someone has to make a stand. Enter the hero. This time is a kind of 50's world that is not our own. The situations and characters are bigger than life. In some ways this is the problem with the movie, if you don't buy in and get caught up in a camp view, then you will lose the tension in the movie.Try to enjoy the music and take the fight situations as they come. somewhat like it was in getting home in ""the Warriors"".but enjoy the scenery and the characters as they try to stand for something, even if they are the bad guys, good guys, cops, managers, or performers.This is a very 80's movie and I Love it for it's 50's approach.",Streets of Fire

It is a strange yet compelling mix of Action, Musical, Romance and Comedy. Set in a Fantasy World that is a blend of American 50s Style and Neo Noir feeling of the 80s. Including with Neon-Lights, Dark Alleys and lots of Smoke. The Film oozes Style and atmosphere. The Dialogue consist almost entirely of Cheeky One-Liners. Fortunately all the Actors play it straight and thereby give there Parts credibility. While there is no real Character development or much depth to speak of, the Actors are all perfectly cast. There Characters are all Archetypes. The Hero (Michael Pare), The Villain (Willem Dafoe), the Damsel in Distress (Diane Lane), The Sidekick (Amy Madigan) and the Comedic Relief play by Rick Moranis.Great Cinematography, exceptional Lighting, tight Editing and detailed Set and Costume Design make sure the Film succeeds on every Technical Level. And then there is the Soundtrack. Besides The Actors and the Style it is the Movies biggest strength. If you are into 80s Rock you are in for a treat. There are several Song Number that play out in full length. Especially the Opening and closing Number are absolutely fantastic. As i said before, except the occasional One-Liner there is very little Dialogue. But that is by no means a bad thing. It gives Walter Hill great opportunity for visual Storytelling. For a Movie that could very easily be described as being style over substance, it is remarkable that the Final Scene never fails to put a Tear into my Eye.The Film itself did not find it's Audience when it was released in 1984 but has gathered a ever growing cult following since. One interesting Note is, that while the Film failed to make and impact with Western Audiences, it proofed quit popular in Japan. Even heavenly inspiring a Anime show called Bubblegum Crises from 1987. Just watch the opening Scene of the fist Episode! No doubt, Street of Fire is not for everybody. But if you are into Rock'n Roll, like your Lights neon and your Alleys foggy and want to experience something truly unique, you should give SoF a chance! It has lots of Style, one of the best Soundtracks ever produced, memorable One-Liners and great Actors, many of them who have since become Stars. One of them being the lovely and very underrated Diane Lane who has never looked more beautiful then in this movie. And that's saying something.Streets of Fire is a Movie you either end up falling in love with or don't care about at all. I for one consider myself lucky to be falling in the first category.",Streets of Fire
134,cvdh1,Come for the Cheese. Stay for the Music.,8,1 May 2006,"Sure, this movie has a plot that can be summed up in three sentences (Bad Guy kidnaps Good Guy's ex, Good Guy rescues girl and kicks some serious ass, Good Guy and Witty Sidekick ride off into the sunset), dialog that would make a B-Movie writer cringe, and acting that 'over the top' doesn't even begin to describe.But you didn't come for the plot, now did you? You came for the Music, and boy, did you ever get your money's worth. 'Streets' has to have by far the best soundtrack of any movie. Ever.Where else could you find an original Stevie Nicks song ('Sorcerer)', perfectly executed by Marilyn Martin? Or a Tom Petty ballad ('Never be You') exquisitely pitched by Maria McKee? Not to mention two of the legendary Jim Steinman's finest (and most underrated) Power Ballads - 'Tonight is What it Means to be Young' and 'Nowhere Fast'. These two songs alone would be worth the price of admission, but you also get a slew of Ry Cooder rockers 'n rollers in the bargain.So go ahead and watch this movie till your eyes bleed, or your DVD player melts. But whatever you do, make sure that you have the volume on your amp is cranked up to 11.",Streets of Fire
135,bleat13,Silly but fun,6,12 May 2012,"I haven't seen this movie since 1984, when it first came out and I was 18 years old. I loved the music and have been listening to most of the soundtrack since. Then the atmosphere really disturbed me—and I thought Michael Paré was the hottest.Rewatching it now, I can see how awful the dialogue is but appreciate that the actors (quite a few of whom have had good careers) seemed to realize this. The atmosphere remains creepy-ish but more intriguing because I can see that many are just painted backdrops and not meant to look ""real."" ""Another time, another place"" is a little much as the described setting for this movie, since it looks like NY (Brooklyn?) in the '50s.But Willem Dafoe is just about as disturbing as he was with his leather overalls (what was with that?), odd hairdo, and creepy smile.",Streets of Fire
136,MisterFahrenheit,"Amazing, underrated movie",10,10 December 2005,"This is a great film. It's not the most thought provoking film ever made but it never pretends to be either. The set designs are terrific, Michael Pare is a great hero and the direction is pacey. Diane Lane is quite possibly the most fantastically sexy leading lady ever in this movie, the concert scenes are incredible, especially the opening song. There's a lot of atmosphere in this flick, the '50's styling with '8o's music works well - the neon drenched, rain soaked streets are a joy to behold in the DVD transfer of the film. Streets of Fire is a much underrated film, and in my opinion much the best thing Walter Hill ever made. Everyone who had a hand in making it should be proud. It should take pride of place in any movie buff's collection",Streets of Fire
137,xmallen1,"Great movie, great music, great performances",10,6 January 2007,"What a cast! This was possibly Michael Pare's last decent film, Willem DaFoe's first great role (he's a devilish bad guy) Diane Lane is the gorgeous heroine, Rick Rossovich is the novice police officer, Bill Paxton plays a great wise-ass bartender and Rick Moranis tries to be a tough guy. If you like a movie with people with a lot of attitude, this is the film for you. It's a classic good vs. evil with the hero (Michael Pare) who just wants to be left alone. Everyone has advice for him - his sister, the cops, the bartender, his ex-girlfriend, his ex-girlfriend's new beau - and of course he does things his own way. The movie takes place in ""another place and another time"" and has a fifties feel but the music is all 80's - Jim Steinman, Tom Petty, and Stevie Nicks wrote some of the soundtrack. At the time, it was a low budget film with unknowns that was filmed extremely well. I gave it a 10 for fun.",Streets of Fire

139,lee953go,Streets of Fire,7,30 October 2005,"In this movie, the hero, Cody(Michael Pare) is stopped by two policemen. One is white and one is African-American. The one playing the African-American policeman is someone who has been in other movies or TV shows. Can anyone tell me the name of the one portraying the African-American policeman? Please help. This is a great movie by director Walter Hill. He made the Pare character to wear ""western"" clothes and have a name, ""Cody"", which obviously reminds one of a person famous in the American West. Cody packs a Wincherster rifle used in the west and his pistol also seems to be western in style. It is hard to pinpoint the time of this ""Rock and Roll Fable"". The cars are from the fifties or before. The clothing style is from the fifties at times and from the eighties for some people. Rick Moranis wears the style-less striped shirt with plaid jacket and checked bow-tie with big glasses and flat haircut. This much his style in his later movies such as, ""Ghostbusters"" and ""Honey I Shrunk The Kids"". Bill Paxton plays a dufus that he later portrays again in ""True Lies"" with Arnold Schwartzanegger. In a very small part, a filthy bum is played by Ed Begley Jr. At the beginning of the movie, Moranis plays Billy Fish as a brash, obnoxious booking agent. At the end of the movie his mood changes(possibly because he gets the girl?)and he becomes a likable character. The fight scene between Raven(Wilem Defoe) and Cody(Michael Pare) is very intense and believable. The ending is very interesting. It seems to leave room for a sequel, but so far, no one has made one, unfortunately.",Streets of Fire

There are so many stars in here, early in their career, the story is great, the soundtrack is awesome...great 80's movie! I wish they had done the sequels! If you've never seen it, watch it, just for Willem Dafoe! He is an evil villain! Amy Madigan, Diane Lane, Michael Pare, Rick Rossovich, Rick Moranis, and who can ever forget Bill Paxton! What a cast! I also love all of the filming in Chicago. As soon as you see it, you just know it's Chicago! All in all, it's just a great, underrated, under-watched film that is a lot of fun to watch! If you can't find it on cable, rent the DVD!",Streets of Fire
142,glen-parry,A film I never tire of watching,10,7 July 2007,"From the opening credits; which have elements of ""Pulp Fiction"" in their appearance of tearing pages, to the final concert scene this is a tour de force of how to shoot a film.Fine, the plot may not be that deep: celebrity is kidnapped, ex-boyfriend returns to rescue her (for cash - ostensibly), they fall in love again, but boyfriend realises it can never work out, ultra-bad guys, damsels in distress & a reluctant hero (even elements of the sort of interpretation of honour that went out of fashion in the 18th century, but it works wonderfully in the context of the, fantasy, 1950's(ish) world in which it is set.The cast is just about perfect for the roles they portray. Daine Lane: beautiful enough that the audience understands why the villain should want to kidnap her, without taking away from the idea that it is her singing talent that has got her to where she is today.Michael Pare, really does provide the John Wayne style performance that his role requires of him.Whilst Willem Dafoe is truly menacing in his portrayal of Raven; the truly evil gang leader.The big surprise performance comes from Rick Moranis. For someone who made his name playing the nerdy nice guy, his portrayal of the rather unlikeable Billy Fish comes as a revelation.Where this film really scores for me though is with the scenery & lighting.I remember the film's revue on the BBC at the time of its release & it being commented that virtually all of it was filmed on a sound stage, but you'd never believe it. Concert halls, city street &, even, a red light district are all made to look so believable.Add to this a cracking sound track; with two of Jim Stienman's best ever songs to open & close the film, & you have 90 minutes of pure entertainment that; having watched it every time it came on TV since it came out & hunted round until I found the DVD, I would recommend to anyone .",Streets of Fire
143,angierix_69,A DIANE LANE film before she was a big star,10,15 June 2002,"This is a cool and stylish film that has ""UNFAITHFUL"" and ""PERFECT STORM"" star DIANE LANE as a rock chick called ELLEN AIM who is kidnapped by badass WILLEM DAFOE of ""SPIDERMAN"". The performances are O.K. (LANE and DAFOE are by far the best), although AMY MADIGAN does a good job. PARE is wooden as the hero and MORANIS is an annoyance. The films soundtrack is great and it is worth seeing for the style and the sets. For all the lads out there who want their DIANE LANE fix, this is not to be missed. A good comic book style movie that entertains.",Streets of Fire
144,Byrnstar,Great forgotten 80's romp...,9,4 August 2015,"This movie...it's as if the 50's and the 80's had a love child, and it that child was William Defoe, channeling Kiefer Sutherland's David from the Lost Boys plus Edward Cullen...and then they gave him crack. If you thought the man was creepy before, there's a particular scene with latex overalls and fire that just cranks it up to 11.Great movie if you love the 80's. The visuals are awesome, a combination of 50's scenery and cars mixed with tons of neon and 80's punk dress/music. Plot is so-so – the concept is straightforward but halfway through the movie it turns into a live action series of TV Tropes (which are fun, don't get me wrong, but send the plot all over the place). There are numerous scenes where the actors are clearly reading rather than performing their lines, and there's no chemistry between the male lead and his damsel in distress. But seeing Rick Moranis hamming it up as a sniveling business manager, Bill Paxton in a bit part as a wimpy barkey, Amy Madigan as a surprisingly interesting Action Girl and a young William Defoe being a creepy creeper of all creeps is more than worth it.If you want a movie that will trigger 80's nostalgia and is a good romp to watch with a beer, this is it. If you're looking for art, you probably want something else. But this movie is what gave us the 80's hit song 'I Can Dream About You', and for that alone I give it top marks.",Streets of Fire

Review before me dated Nov-2005. The soundtrack & movie are a surreal symbiotic pair. A perfect fit. I think it's under-rated and I would have nominated it for an academy for the best screenplay.

The shared plot point was fighting all night through gangs and police to reach home. Frankly, this movie had so much going for it just in the ingredients, I don't see how it could fail. Michael Paré (Eddie and the Cruisers), Diane Lane (The Outsiders), Bill Paxton (Everything), Willem Dafoe (Everything), Rick Moranis (Everything). Combine this with a couple of Jim Steinman songs and you can't miss. The critics weren't too kind to this one but it reminds me of one of the things that was magic about being 14.**Duh, of course this was similar with ""The Warriors.""

Another star was original, high-energy, Rock 'n Roll which was used effectively to move the story forward.  The story begins at a Rock 'n Roll concert which becomes the scene of a crime.

It's pretty simple but what you have to watch out for here is Walter Hill's visual and editorial style which was probably the best around in the eighties.There isn't any Oscar-worthy performances here but there was never meant to be none - Michael Pare does well with his limited John Wayne modelled role, Rick Moranis shows that he can play much more than the ""nerdy-neurotic"" character that made him world famous in the early nineties, William Defoe plays a better villain in this than he did in Spiderman and Diane Lane shows that she was once, the hottest woman in Hollywood (she still ain't too bad today!).This film deserves more credit, votes, attention and DVD extra's than it presently has - definitely one of the best film's of the eighties.",Streets of Fire

You wouldn't realize just how much talent went into the creation of such a great concept. Not to mention the host of actors who made cameo appearances. Actors such as Bill Paxton, Robert Townsend, Rick Moranis, Amy Madigan and many other rising stars can be seen cutting their teeth on this film.Besides the great cast , perhaps the best thing this movie was known for was it's STELLAR soundtrack. Complied and written by Ry Cooder and such heavyweights as Stevie Nicks and Jim Steinman. Though the most popular track was Dan Hartmans ""I can Dream About You"" which reached #1 in some markets, true fans of the movie recognize the songs ""Tonight is What it Means to be Young"" and ""Nowhere Fast"", both written by Jim Steinman, as the showcase songs.The songs were performed by a ""Fictional"" act created by Jim Steinman named ""Fire Inc."" Led by LEGENDARY performers such as Holly Sherwood, Laurie Seargent and Rory Dodd, the Fire Inc. sound had a very ""Bonnie Tyler-esquire"" feel to them. They should have. BOTH Holly Sherwood and Rory Dodd would later sing on Bonnie Tyler's Grammy winning SMASH hit "" Total Eclipse of the Heart"". Rory would sing the signature line ""Turn Around"". Holly would appear a number of times on that album, and with such similar voices I always wondered why Bonnie Tyler, a singer from Europe, was chosen to perform those tracks, and not Holly Sherwood.Poor casting and lackluster direction may have doomed this picture. But the performances of Diane Lane, Amy Madigan, Michael Pare, coupled with the strong voice of HOlly Sherwood makes this a MUST SEE FILM.If you see it only for the parts where Diane Lane is lip syncing over Holly on ""Tonight"", its worth it.

166,candrus-647-341936,"Like one of it's songs, Streets of Fire is ""One Bad Stud""",10,28 January 2010,"Set in a neon accentuated urban nether land, under the nearly omnipresent overhead commuter rail system, this is one of the best Rock & Roll fiction movies ever made and hands down far better than most of the so called special effects blockbusters of the present. Streets of Fire grips the viewer emotionally with it's frontier culture replete with police corruption and jungle law, vivid characters, kick-ass music, gritty visuals and artful direction. I was hooked during the opening credits as soon as the switchblades came out and the ""Chuck Berryesque"" music started . Outrage and concern start right off the bat with rock star Ellen Aim's (Diane Lane) kidnapping by the Bombers MC gang, Reva Cody's (Diane Van Valkenburgh) distress note to her brother and the return of the stoic anti-hero Tom Cody (Michael Pare). On the way to his mission to rescue former flame Ellen Aim, Cody meets McCoy (Amy Madigan), a feisty wise cracking soldier and the obnoxious Billy Fish (Rick Moranis) Ellen Aim's new boyfriend/manager. With a ""spoils of war"" custom Merc convertible and an arsenal of high powered firearms the three set off on their quest, Thorchies, a sleazy bar in the bowels of the infamous Battery.Amidst a fiery background, the villainous Raven Shaddock leader of the Bombers played to the hilt by (Willem Dafoe) in one of his best action rolls ever, confronts Cody and sets the stage for the movie's inevitable climax, not before, however, a touching reprise of the Cody/Aim romance. With a terrific showdown worthy of a ""High Noon"" comparison and the overall fast paced R&R action, I found this movie irresistible. It's the movie's ending, however, that brought a lump to my throat and made me fall for it hook line and sinker.I was around in the 50/60's and can relate to the potent images in this movie and the primal emotions they evoke.

167,alansmithee-858-797131,NOWHERE EVEN FASTER: The definition of an era,8,27 May 2014,"Trashed by the critics, failed at the box office and hailed by a young generation of MTV addicted fans!It's a typical or in retrospect a state-of-the art film of the mid 1980s; violent, superficial and excessively stylish with something less than a minimalistic plot:START POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERTcelebrated rock singer Ellen Aim get kidnapped by gang, and ex boyfriend/cynical lone wolf/paid gunslinger is off to gangland to fight them and try to break her free.END POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERTThe film is set in a slight futuristic but yet quite familiar surrounding with a breath of a West Side Story kind of atmosphere, a time and place where law and order seems to be corrupt, broken down or absent. ""Grease"" had overturned the box office charts a little less than a decade earlier, and the Happy Days 1950 nostalgia were on a re-run. The air of the 50s is quite obvious with the cars, the diners and the gangs and all.But nevertheless; everything seems blown out of proportion and somewhat out of time and place. The key here is the tag line: ""A Rock & Roll Fable"", suggesting equivalence with a fantasy or a fairy tale, but in hard core rock'n roll style with a twist; not so much a tale with talking animals acting like humans as a one with humans acting more or less like animals.If you asked me in what time it takes place, I would say about 15 minutes into the future...According to the film critics there where too much violence and too nicely choreographed. Neither did they care very much for the surreal and anachronistic settings, nor the compressed (i.e. lack of) plot.The final nail in the coffin seems to have been the rather daring and for the genré very unusual musical concept with music video inspired segments breaking up the action, and the film critics of that time just didn't seem to get it.The film failed horribly at the box office of course, but for the very same reasons it all worked out extremely well with the MTV generation. All that self-indulgent irony (irony => see PS at the end) just fell into place and soon enough it became a cult film in the true sense; hard to get to see but very much appreciated by a solid core of MTV addicted fans.Some of the music is nothing less than fantastic, and the Fire Inc. speed-in-blood performance of ""Nowhere Fast"" with the distinctive beat/heavy baseline and build up to climax is an all time classic. In fact, it was recited in a scene in Black Cat, White Cat by Balkan/Serbian filmmaker Emir Kusturica.Streets of Fire is one of those movies really capturing, or rather defining, the excessive and polished mannerisms of the 1980s, and it is a very good place to start if you want to explore that era.If you like it and want more, there are some other movies you might want to check out (in no specific order):Blade Runner - Ridley Scott Subway - Luke Besson Escape From New York - John Carpenter Manhunter - Michael Mann The Lost Boys - Joel SchumacherENJOY!PSQuote from A Dictionary of Modern English Usage by Henry Watson Fowler:""Irony is a form of utterance that postulates a double audience, consisting of one party that hearing shall hear & shall not understand, & another party that, when more is meant than meets the ear, is aware both of that more & of the outsiders' incomprehension""",Streets of Fire
168,CamFry,Terrible money-grab.,1,25 May 2020,"Terrible script, terrible dialogue, miscast actors (Michael Pare is a snoozefest and Rick Moranis completely miscast). List of talents wasted in this movie: Willem Dafoe, Diane Lane, Rick Moranis (shouldn't have even been in the movie), Amy Madigan. Pare is a broke man's Sly Stallone.How many long shots can be done of cars and motorcycles driving in puddles or popping wheelies, or one too many badly lit shots under a subway track? Ed Begley Jr. jumping out of the darkness to give them a clue on where to find Diane Lane's character. Cringe-worthy.Overall ludicrous, moronic and soul-less movie about nothing. And to think, they wanted to make two more! lol Only good thing is it has the song ""I Can Dream About You"", a top 10 hit that year. Unfortunately, the guy who sang it in the movie isn't even singing it, lip syncing it being sung by someone ELSE not named Dan Hartman. Money-grab by the director, who got what he wanted because of the success of ""48 Hrs"".The screenwriter said it provided inspiration to a movie like ""Se7en"" because it rained a lot in that movie. And that ""if we'd done more gore, our chances of hooking the audience would be greater."" I think if everyone in the movie had died in a fiery auto wreck about 5 minutes in, that would've been the best use of gore.",Streets of Fire
169,jrw36,Oh. My. God.,9,26 December 2003,"Streets of Fire was the most amazing movie I have seen in the last hour, and here's why.This movie is like a painting done by Michaelangelo and Andy Warhol, set to Music composed by Wagner and the B-52s, at a reception catered by the world's best cake maker.This movie has it all: Rick Moranis, Willem Dafoe, the Chief from Carmen Sandiego, and possibly even Joe Pesci, though we're not sure about that.Obviously this movie was made by a director from 20,000 years in the future where movies are awesome. However, to cover up his time travelling antics, he staged the movie in the Feighties, a weird mix between the Fifties and the Eighties.In all seriousness, the cinematography is stunning, and every frame of the movie is a stunning graphic achievement in its own right.This review may seem a bit incoherent, as I have just seen the movie in question and my life has been undeniably changed forever. You may experience the same feelings of euphoria.If you don't like this movie, you're dumb.And you're short.",Streets of Fire
170,mnwild13,"Hands down best ""Musical""? ever",10,2 June 2004,"watched this movie probably 100 times as a kid and never got tired of it. Cody is the shiznit, the loner I always wanted to be. Bought it in DVD the songs are still great and the movie is as fun as ever. Hold the scene in the bar with that cheesy song never did like that 3 minutes of the movie. Early HBO classic with the likes of Last Dragon and Thrashin. Showed it to my buddy who had never seen warned him before hand that he would probably think it was a bad 80's flick. And he thoroughly enjoyed it. A lot of people knock 80's movies because they are not yet classics like a lot of Black and White flicks, And don't have the great effects that the newer movies have. This movie has a great atmosphere which blends the 50's with the 80's and draws you in to its little world.",Streets of Fire
171,munbok,A bomb but i loved it!,10,12 December 2004,"It was a bomb back in '84 but i loved it nevertheless. I just bought the DVD and am still loving it! Walter Hill just had a monster hit (48 Hrs) before making this 'rock and roll fable'. The entire movie was pure self-indulgence with some questionable casting. Michael Pare had very little chemistry with Diane Lane. And their few scenes together were unconvincing. It didn't help when Michael Pare recited his lines in the most wooden manner. I do like Rick Moranis though. The screenplay is camp and intentionally 'film noir'ish'. The whole movie (all one-and-a-half hour of it) played like a music video complete with 80s style electric neon lights. All style, no substance. So why did i give it a 10/10 rating? Simply because i have seen it repeatedly over the past 20 years and have not gone tired of it. The opening and especially the closing numbers are mini classics.",Streets of Fire
172,madvikins,Comic book action story with style,10,15 January 2005,"I seems that not everyone understands the greatness with this movie? -The actors do a really good work-Moranis is one, and Pare is good, but he has much less to play with as a carachter. -style is everything here: the lines are like they where stolen from old westerns or movies from the 50s. To really enjoy this movie: do not expect the ordinary action...see it as a ""musical"" set in a theatre and admire the artificial ""artsiness"" of this studio-style film! ...the bad guys are really bad...but funny, -and the good guy is really brave... -This is not suppose to be your ordinary action movie! -This is art...and poetry!Best Regards/MadvikinS",Streets of Fire
173,Prince_Kaisie,I really enjoyed the movie,9,18 April 2005,"The film deserves better then the comment I first had to read here. So that is why I comment as well. First of all, the music is awesome, a good mix of several styles but not a single one that i did not like. OK, that is personal opinion and everybody has a different taste, but I think most people can get something out of those songs. The Plot? Yes, it is simple, but it is a movie and does not have to represent real life. Tom Cody is a tough bastard and although he (nearly) singlehandedly beats all his opponents we get to see that he has his faults too. The dialogues are down to earth, but if you liked: last boyscout, you should love them. If you expect Shakespeare, go look somewhere else. The movie is a very good blend of action and music and surely deserves better then the original comment gave it. For me, it is one of my Top ten movies (ranking in between Ivanhoe, Highlander(and there can be only ONE movie deserving that name), Willow, The Good,the Bad and the Ugly, Life of Brian and some more). So I hope you will consider giving this movie a chance and try to get a copy some day.Yours,Prince Kaisie",Streets of Fire

176,robscottw,leader of the pack steals queen of the hop and soldier boy comes home to save the day,10,19 August 2005,"Campy? Yes. Played for laughs, you bet. Entertaining? Damn straight! But, this is a guy's movie. Few girls I've known (maybe 1 out of 10) really LIKED the movie, most just tolerate it. Its a buddy movie, but the buddys are a guy and a gal, little different. Lots of campy, sometimes just plain awful dialog, but some GEMS too. And there is a message, loyalty to your friends and community, integrity in your actions, understanding of others point of view and reasons for doing things. And that bad guys can get as many guns as they want, if peacable townspeople want peace they just may have to pick up a piece too now and then. Then there's the music, and the delicious Diane Lane, which makes rock and roll feel like it ought to feel. Too bad all concerts I've seen haven't been that good. This movie is a lot more fun than a lot of so-called ""good"" movies. Watch it, dream it, enjoy it.",Streets of Fire
177,angelman52,classic by young actors,10,5 October 2005,"This movie should be re-released on DVD so I don't wear out my only VHS copy!I see many other movies coming out on DVD and feel this one has merit.The sound track is very good, the lighting on defoe's first scene is mint. the car is cool,the diner scene was great.What can I say I want this flick on DVD so bad. all the classic corny lines the fight scene at the end,come on wasn't that great? those hammers were awesome. And the doo whop sound of the Sorrels combined with the moon walk. All or most all of the actors have gone onto very good careers, and although I'm not positive this may have been some of their first film. I wish I knew who to write to to get this classic film onto DVD. I see the warriors has come out on DVD and Streets of fire is every inch as good as that.",Streets of Fire
178,Shadowpost,Ahead of its time but lasts as the quality is rediscovered,9,5 October 2006,"While the movie was not a hit in 1984, it has developed quite a following over time by comparison with similar films, stylistically, that followed. It seems to draw in new devotees whenever it is shown on cable or a specialized channel like TNT. I consider that to be a true sign of enduring quality in a film. It's not just that the cast is chock full of actors who went on to success in films; ""Hollywood Knights"" has a fair share of future successful performers but it doesn't gain fans like SOF does. Considering the youth and inexperience of most of the cast, the director coaxed some really memorable performances out of them. It reminds me somewhat of ""Saturday Night Fever"" in the basic noir-ish look and the tension. Like Saturday Night Fever, Streets of Fire has a killer rock-n-roll soundtrack that fits the times depicted and stands on its own as a work of art. It even has some of the same gritty social commentary regarding race and stereotyping. But Streets of Fire was ahead of its time in trying to update the ""outsider stranger comes to town and rescues girl but will they be able to live happily ever after?"" concept to the 80's. Think of The Wild One as an 80's musical and you'll get a general idea.",Streets of Fire
179,katrinwolf,"Don't know how, but it works.",9,28 October 2017,"This is probably going to be the least useful review ever, but I'm still going to try. I saw this film about a year ago, during one of the ""watch random unknown things"" marathon, expecting nothing from it. And when it was over, my reaction could be summed up in ""okay, not bad but nothing special, next one"". I moved on, being 100% sure that I'll forget about this film in a few days. Yet, after some time, bits of it started returning to me. Again and again and again. Things I didn't think I would care to remember just dropped by my thoughts by themselves without any effort. Then I would start listening to the soundtrack. Then I would look up the names of the characters I couldn't recall. Then I would look at the poster and add it to the list of ones I'd like to put on my wall some day. Then I would look up some scenes. Then... then. Now it's been a year, and I'm re-watching this film, as I rarely do. This little film I was sure I wouldn't remember the day after. I should probably blame the ending. Yeah, I probably should. Beginning with the soundtrack. Tonight Is What It Means To Be Young, written at the very last moment. The song my mind tried to connect with Steinman the first time I heard it and failed to do so. Leading to the moment when, upon watching Dance of the Vampires the musical, I was the only person in the crowd nearly falling out of my seat upon recognition of the song, once again used as the most suitable closing theme. This alone could elevate even the most clichéd ending in existence. Which wasn't the case here. While I'm almost sure there have been similar ones in (probably better) films I've never seen, even aside from Casablanca, an ending in a campy action flick where the guy voluntarily DOESN'T get a girl? Now that's something you don't see every day. And that's the type of thing that gets me, too. That line, ""Yeah, she needs me, but she loves you...?"" One can feel how much it is placed here as a part of the machine, you see how it's supposed to affect you, you see how it's supposed to work. Usually this lack of subtlety, of ""movie magic"" covering the mechanisms behind it, leads to the whole thing not working. I thought it wouldn't work. Yet it worked. And that's the case with many things in this film. Blunt and simple. The guy's cool? Well, give him a badass car and a long coat. That guy wants a girl? He'll kidnap her. The bad guy? Let's make him Willem Dafoe in black leather dungarees (haha, oh man, I'm still not over that. I really didn't need to see Willem Dafoe in leather dungarees) They're having a badass fight? Well, guns or fists are for pussies, let's use sledgehammers! Basically a collection of tropes and symbols, if you retell it, it really starts sounding like a modern-day myth or legend. Or a fable, if you please. And if you look at it like that, it works. Do I recommend seeing it? I don't know. I mean, I still cannot fully explain why these little parts of this film keep casually slipping into my head, as there're films that I love that don't do that at all. All I can say is, I don't mind them doing that. And watching it again, I can honestly say I enjoy Streets of Fire. And you might enjoy it, too.",Streets of Fire

I think it should have more recognition than it does. Diane lane and Michael Pierre are awesome. A lot of people think Diane lane is cool for her new movies but i know her from way back when!!!!!! So this movie is great from a young-in. I know Diane Lane from younger days like The Outsiders and Streets of Fire. Everybody loves her from her new movies but I was there for her old movies. Diane is my favorite actress in the whole wide world. She is beautiful in Streets of Fire. I grew up with that movie. Most of my friends don't know that movie. Her acting can't be replicated.,Streets of Fire
184,lrw0250,The movie of my childhood,10,24 March 2006,"Although I was only one when this film was released in 1984, my dad was a big Walter Hill fan and bought the film on video when it came out. My sister and I LOVED this film as kids. Honestly, I think we wore out about three copies on video by watching it over and over. I think it was the music (obviously), the bright lights and the fact that to an eight year old girl Ellen Aim is the coolest person ever!! The final stage scene at the end was up there with the last dance in Dirty Dancing as our favourite film moments. Since watching it all those years ago I have remained a fan ( I have Nowhere Fast and Tonight is What it means to be Young on CD in my car- excellent driving music!).However I am now also able to appreciate the amazing work of Walter Hill in this film. The sets, the underscoring, the lighting, the whole atmosphere of the movie is in a league of its own. It is so unlike anything else I've ever seen and was obviously way ahead of its time, which is perhaps the reason for its failure to do well when it was released. There are so few people I know that have actually seen this film which is a real shame because it really deserves to be appreciated for the absolute fantasy that it is. Long live rock and roll!""I'm not an angel but at least I'm a girl""-",Streets of Fire
