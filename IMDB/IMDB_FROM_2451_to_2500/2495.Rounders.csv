0,bkoganbing,"You Read The Opponent, Not The Cards",9,4 September 2008,"Rounders is a story of a pair of prep school buddies, Matt Damon and Edward Norton, who are a pair of poker sharks. Damon's used his winnings to pay for law school and Norton's gone on to other enterprises like identity theft which has landed him a stretch in prison.Damon after being taken to the cleaners by Russian mob guy John Malkovich has given up poker for law school. Norton's finishing his stretch in the joint and as it turns out he owes Malkovich some heavy duty debt. He's needing some help, especially after leg breaker Michael Rispoli gives Norton a sample of what he can expect. Damon owes Norton as well for not ratting him out on some prep school scam that could have gotten him expelled like Norton. Needless to say he goes back into the life.I'm willing to wager (no pun intended) that because Rounders came out right after Good Will Hunting that this was a project intended for Damon and Ben Affleck. I think Ben probably showed good sense in thinking he was not quite right for the role. Certainly Norton who plays some really edgy characters was far better for the role of Lester 'Worm' Murphy.Damon does all right for himself as the standup Mike McDermott. He also because he discharges the debt he owes Norton, realizes that he should follow his dream as well. What it is and how the film ends I won't say, but if you have a dream you have to follow it because you won't know if you don't try. In addition to everything else Rounders is quite a look into the world of professional gambling. As Damon says even if you play it honest, it's far more skill than luck. You read the opponent, not the cards.Rounders was a great career followup to the acclaimed Good Will Hunting for Matt Damon. Even if you're not a gambler by nature, this film will fascinate one.",Rounders
1,SnoopyStyle,Good poker movie elevated by great actors,8,12 January 2014,"Mike McDermott (Matt Damon) is a card player who loses it all to KGB (John Malkovich). He vows to quit to his girlfriend Jo (Gretchen Mol). However when his childhood friend Worm (Edward Norton) gets out of prison, he pulls Mike back into the life.The card games can get very boring if done incorrectly. The games here are done pretty well. At least, the movie doesn't dwell on the games too much. It's the acting which makes this a superior movie. Matt Damon is really solid which allows Ed Norton to play the wild man. Their relationship is the center of the movie. Norton really has the skills to play the darker half of the duo.Some may have difficulties with the message of the movie. The idea of using your god given skills no matter what those skills may be is an unconventional message. I doubt there is another movie where the movie roots for the lead to play poker instead of studying law school.",Rounders
2,gavin6942,The Best Poker Movie Ever?,8,4 March 2016,"A young law school student (Matt Damon) is a reformed gambler who must return to playing big stakes poker to help a friend (Edward Norton) pay off loan sharks.If there is a weak spot in this movie, it is John Malkovich. And I do not mean that as a slight against him, but really more against the casting. He is too well-known of an actor, it jumps out as obvious that he is not a Russian. If you can't get a real Russian, at least get Peter Stormare.Ed Norton does a fine supporting job. Not his best role, but even his lesser roles are still good. He is among the best. And Damon? He nails it. It doesn't seem so much like he's acting as just extending who he naturally is. But that's why it works, because it seems natural. He has the timing and delivery to sound like a sharp, witty huckster.",Rounders
3,lee_eisenberg,"""Rounders"" is totally flat.",2,12 May 2006,"You know how there's supposed to be the ""Oscar curse"", when a person wins a gold statuette and proceeds to star in a really worthless movie? Well, it happened to Matt Damon. After he and Ben Affleck won writing Oscars for ""Good Will Hunting"", they both starred in some real turkeys: Affleck in the god-awful ""Armageddon"" and Damon in the go-nowhere ""Rounders"". This is supposed to be about high-stakes gambling, but the whole thing runs as if the actors are on depressants. There isn't a likable or memorable character anywhere in the movie. So there's the possibility that a screw-up might lead to danger? Well, watching this movie, I wished that something would happen to the worthless characters. AND WHY DOES THE GANGSTER (John Malkovich) HAVE TO BE Russian?!!!!!!!! The point is, you should avoid this movie at all costs. There are plenty of good movies out there, so there's no reason to waste your time on this junk. Also starring Edward Norton, John Turturro, Martin Landau and Gretchen Mol.",Rounders
4,ccthemovieman-1,Good Movie For Poker Fans,5,13 May 2007,"If you like poker - and more and more people seem to be playing it or watching it on TV - you might want to check out this movie. Although a fictional story, you get some good insights on the game, the how and whys.My only warning is that it isn't a family film, that's for sure. There is tons of profanity, beginning with many f-word usages. If you can deal with that, you can deal with the movie (yes, puns intended). Personally, I would have liked to have seen this story cut down on the sleaze factor. I like poker, I like actors Matt Damon, Edward Norton, Gretchen Mol, Famke Janssen, John Turturro, John Malkovich and Martin Landau. With the subject matter and the fabulous cast, this should have been much better but came across a bit too much on the sordid side. Still, for card players this is a movie not to miss.",Rounders
5,blanche-2,"very good, exceptional performances",8,12 October 2012,"Matt Damon, Edward Norton, Gretchen Mol, Martin Landau, John Malkovich, John Turturro, Ray Iannicelli, and Famke Janssen star in ""Rounders,"" a 1998 film directed by John Dahl.Matt Damon plays Mike McDermott, a law student who has made a lot of money playing poker, but at a KGB gambling establishment, he loses everything and goes to work driving a truck for a friend there, Knish (Turturro). He has to promise his girlfriend (Mol) he's going straight.When his best friend, the aptly named Worm, is released from prison, the ever-faithful Mike is there to greet him. Because of a school indiscretion in which Worm refused to name him and was expelled while Mike graduated, Mike has always felt that he ""owed"" Worm big-time. Worm seduces him back into the life, basically so he can be bailed out from all the gambling debts he owed before going into prison.Really excellent movie that takes one into the lives of a couple of ringers who play with amateurs most of the time. John Malcovich as a Russian card shark is excellent, but really, everyone is great. Martin Landau plays a judge who is a professor at the law school and advises Mike ""You can't run away from what you are."" He's wonderful.Director John Dahl takes us into the seedy gambling clubs and the all-night games as Mike, who believes card-playing is not about luck, reads faces and finds mannerisms that are giveaways as to the players' hands. And finally learns, for better or worse, who he is.Highly recommended.",Rounders
6,Quinoa1984,"solid performances, and a stellar script, make this movie for the non-Poker players",8,3 July 2000,"I forgot how much I liked this movie, and how it works a little more on me now than when I saw it almost eight or nine years ago. I don't play poker, but having tipped the hand into the gambling arena this is territory that isn't too foreign, and its on that end that the film Rounders gets its cards, no pun intended, right. But I liked it even before I knew anything about poker (it's still a bit of a foreign concept at times, especially with the wrong people). What makes it work though is that the script by David Levein and Brian Koppelman feels as if they have been at way to many tables, and have poured a lot of that spirit into the film. It also helps that director John Dahl basically casts to the point where he doesn't even NEED to direct, he can just sit back and let the cast take hold of the material.The real beef of the film comes then in the scenes between Damon and Norton, who take good material and make it almost like it could be material for a play on a stage, with a solid conflict that makes good drama (love the dialog). There's also a couple of really terrific scenes between Damon and Martin Landau as a judge, one of those 'old man breaks it down for the young guy' kind of scenes in films that's done without over-doing it. And in general there's a nice rhythm put in place to the film by director Dahl; nothing is too forced, everything happens rather naturalisticlly, and it ends on a great, great note with Malkovich turning in one of his best as Teddy KGB. So, I would recommend it perhaps more than when I first wrote in my review ""great performances save this movie"". There's nothing necessarily to be 'saved', it's just a good movie, and it's apparently now got a cult following over the years (mainly with poker players, but also fans of Norton and Damon).",Rounders
7,sunwarrior13,An Excellent Poker Movie,10,12 October 2011,"This is actually a sports film.The game involves Texas hold 'em,which is one of the most popular poker games.The movie,Rounders has a cult following because of it.The plot of the film presents two friends who need to quickly earn enough cash playing poker to pay off a large debt.It stars Matt Damon and Edward Norton together with John Turturro,Famke Janssen,Gretchen Mol,John Malkovich and Martin Landau.It is directed by John Dahl.The movie is set in New York City.Mike McDermott loses his entire bankroll in a hand of Texas hold'em against Teddy ""KGB"" ,a Russian Mobster who runs an illegal underground poker room. He then decides to concentrate on his law school studies while promising his girlfriend and fellow law student Jo to not play the game anymore. Mentor and fellow rounder Knish offers a part- time job driving a delivery truck to make ends meet.Time passes, and holds on to his promise.But then,his childhood friend Lester 'Worm' Murphy is released from prison. Worm is also a card ""mechanic"", who owes an outstanding debt accumulated before his incarceration. At Worm's influence, Mike is soon rounding again, which interferes with his schooling and causes both internal conflict as well as turmoil with Jo. When Worm is given a five day deadline to pay off his debt, Mike joins him in a furious race to earn the money by playing in several card games in and around New York City. Thus the movie follows the journey of both Mike and Worm in different places to raise the needed money and their consistent clash as the former is a gambler that wants to win the game straight and latter that wants to cheat.Rounders provided a lot of excitement.One may consider the thrills that gambling provides but it was story of both constant conflicts between Mike and Worm,who principles in gambling are opposite each other,that made the story interesting.Credit that to the great performances of Matt Damon and Edward Norton.Aside from that,it had a lot of talented actors in the group like John Malkovich as Teddy KGB and Martin Landau as Petrovsky.The highlight of this film is the final clash between Mike and Teddy KGB,which is a Rocky-like battle between champion and underdog. For that reason alone,this movie is worth the view despite the fact that the story can be clichéd and predictable as well as it does not offer any element new that a sports film may provide except of course that the game of poker is involved.Credit also should be given to the musical score of the film and the original song of the movie,""I Am A Big Star Now"" by Counting Crows.A must see not only for Poker enthusiast and fans of Matt Damon and Edward Norton but also for people who love underdog films in the tradition of Rocky and Victory.",Rounders
8,bevo-13678,Probably,10,26 October 2021,My mum mentioned this once and wanted to get it from the video shop but somebody wanted to watch something else. Next time we went to the video shop it wasn't there anymore.,Rounders
9,hitchcockthelegend,"Now look here, I like cards, but give me some character substance to make me care about the players, eh?",4,23 September 2010,"Rounders is directed by John Dahl and written by David Levien & Brian Koppelman. It stars Matt Damon, Edward Norton, John Turturro, John Malkovich, Gretchen Mol, Famke Janssen & Martin Landau. Music is by Christopher Young and Jean-Yves Escoffier is the cinematographer on location in New York & New Jersey. Film is based around the underground world of high stakes poker. Plot sees Poker playing law student Mike McDermott (Damon) team up with his Poker playing ex-con best friend Lester ""Worm"" Murphy (Norton) to try and raise some serious cash. The cash is needed because ""Worm"" has saddled them both with high debts, the sort of debts that can get you killed.In the years since Rounders was released to mixed reviews and a Luke warm box office, Poker has really taken off to become a hugely popular television staple. So it's perhaps no surprise to learn that John Dahl's Poker based movie has gained a cult following. It's also found momentum due to a number of pro Poker players citing it as either the reason they got into Poker playing, or that it's the best Poker movie ever. High praise indeed, then. Yet for someone like me who doesn't play the game, but most assuredly loves a good sports movie, the film has too much wrong with it to deserve such plaudits.First off is Damon, a fine actor, but not in this role. He never once convinces that he needs to play Poker, let alone play himself into a life and death struggle due to his borderline volatile best friend. He looks and seems out of place throughout, his boyish charm undercuts what little tension there actually is. While his relationship with Norton (turning in a good show) is never interesting or spiky enough to form a solid core from which the film can grow. Dahl merely uses their relationship as intermittent fillers as we jump from one Poker table to the next. Cue one moment when Mike's girl (Mol barely getting time to breath let alone act), who ""shock shock"" hates cards, leaves him; a period of refection for a moment, a life is cards summary and bingo, lets go play cards! I'd have laughed if it wasn't so insulting.What is totally humorous is Malkovich, who after promising much in the beginning as brooding Russian gangster Teddy KGB, descends into pantomime farce for the ""supposed"" nail biting finale. His accent so ludicrous you wonder if you have been whisked into a Hanna-Barbera cartoon whilst you sneaked a peak at your cards. There's also no surprise with the outcome. Poker may be a sport not often filmed on the big screen, but this is a traditional sports movie across the table. Janssen (as yummy as ever) threatens to be a great teasing character but isn't given anything to get her teeth into; which when one considers the director likes his peccadilloes to be film noirish is a surprise. And Landau, too, is given lightweight fluff to work from as a kindly professor type who seems more token than earnest.On the plus side. Escoffier's photography is neat and on the money, particularly for the first quarter as we go into seedy card dens that are dimly lit and tinted by cigar smoke. While Young's score is unobtrusive and deserving of a better film to accompany it. Away from the seemingly always watchable Norton, it's Turturro who comes out the brightest with his non histrionic and believable portrayal of Joey Knish. A sensible and honest character in a film that lacks enough of either of those traits. Utterly predictable and smug into the bargain, Rounders, it seems, is for Poker players only. 4/10",Rounders
10,lastliberal,We can't run from who we are. Our destiny chooses us.,7,9 April 2008,"What stuck with me in watching this? In ""Confessions of a Winning Poker Player,"" Jack King said, ""Few players recall big pots they have won, strange as it seems, but every player can remember with remarkable accuracy the outstanding tough beats of his career."" It seems true to me, cause walking in here, I can hardly remember how I built my bankroll, but I can't stop thinking of how I lost it.Every time I think about poker, I remember the night I lost it with a straight flush. But, leave it to Matt Damon to remind me about that night.Damon and Edward Norton were fantastic in a film that makes poker look interesting. No, I cannot fathom how anyone could watch poker on TV, but I was enchanted by their performances.Of course, it doesn't hurt to have John Turturro, John Malkovich, Gretchen Mol, Famke Janssen, and Martin Landau to help you out.Great movie about life, losing, and chasing your dreams.",Rounders
11,zardoz-13,"Don't Get Cornered with ""Rounders!""",4,24 May 2008,"Watching ""Rounders"" is no big deal.Starring Matt Damon, Edward Norton, and John Malkovich, this savvy but soporific saga about high-stakes poker seethes with classy acting and authentic atmosphere. Sadly, where drama calls on the plot to pay off, ""Rounders"" cashes in its chips. Unfortunately, this low-key, pretentious potboiler never turns up the heat or the hustle. Coming from a gifted director like John Dahl, ""Rounders"" qualifies as a major bust. Dahl and freshman screenwriters David (the 2004 ""Walking Tall"" remake) Levien and Brian (""Ocean's Thirteen"") Koppelman develop secondary characters and settings with greater vibrancy than either their hero or his predicament. But even the secondary characters suffer. They register with greater screen presence but less screen time. Evidently, Miramax tamper with the film. Characters enter and exit without explanation and the plot comes and goes in fits and starts. Not only does ""Rounders"" ante up only intermittent moments of suspense, sex, and romance, the filmmakers also never must enough momentum to keep the story from stalling out when the action should be steaming ahead.""Rounders"" are card sharps. Mike McDermott (Matt Damon of ""Good Will Hunting"") is a street-wise, young stud working his way through law school with gambling addiction. The movie opens with dramatic potential as he loses $30-thousand dollars of his hard-earned savings to a creepy Russian gambler, Teddy KGD (John Malkovich of ""Of Mice and Men"") in a tense poker match. Mike's fellow law student and live-in squeeze Jo (Gretchen Mol of "" Girl 6"") persuades him to reform. Earning his bucks as a lowly route salesman holds little appeal for Mike. Mike has poker in his blood. Late one evening, when he stops by to visit his law school dean, Professor Abe Petrosvky (Oscar winner Martin Landau of ""Ed Wood""), he catches them playing a friendly game of low-stakes cards. Mike doesn't have time to examine their hands to know what they're holding. Instead, he can read their faces. ""If you can't spot the sucker in your first half-hour at the table,"" Mike explains, dazzling Abe and his colleagues with his extraordinary skills, ""you are the sucker.""Mike is a prodigy at poker. Nevertheless, he lets his more legitimate, status-quo ambitions of getting a law degree interfere with his first lovepoker. Like life, ""Rounders"" concerns choices. The more that Mike thinks about it, the more that he prefers poker. His blond girlfriend Jo struggles to keep him focused on his legal studies, but neither her love nor her sexuality can overwhelm the thrill that Mike derives from gambling. If you look hard enough, ""Rounders"" shares some literary similarities with the classic American novel ""Huckleberry Finn."" Like the carefree, irresponsible Huck who runs off to the river, Mike knows that he shouldn't be gambling. Jo imitates the Widow as she struggles futilely to break him of his poker addiction. ""Rounders"" takes place in the shady gambling dens of the Big Apple. These hidden lairs lure Mike with the same potency that the river seduced Huck. Unlike ""Huckleberry Finn,"" however, ""Rounder"" doesn't qualify as a classic.On the other hand, Mike doesn't have the reliable friend that Huck had in runaway slave Jim. Instead, Mike has Les Murphy (Edward Norton of ""American X"" at his sleazy best). Aptly nicknamed 'Worm,' Les is just as ill-behaved as the couple of con-artists that hitched a ride with Huck on his raft down the river. Worm gets out of prison no long after ""Rounders"" unfolds. Mike and Worm had a scam going a couple of years back when their luck eroded. Worm shut his trap, took the rap, and did the time. Now, Mike feels indebted to his old scummy buddy. Worm has no qualms. He cheats everybody, Mike included, and never blinks. Eventually, Jo moves out when she learns that Mike is bluffing her again.Now, not only does Mike find himself saddled with Worm's staggering $25-thousand dollar debt, but also Worm's unsavory adversaries harass him. Things worsen when Mike finds out that Grama (Michael Rispoli of ""The Weather Man""), a vicious thug who pimps for KGB, has brought up Worm note. Grama threatens to smash Worm's arms and legs if he doesn't fork over the fund in 48 hours. Mike and Worm hit the road in search of suckers. Refusing to let Worm win by cheating, Mike vows to get their bucks solely on the strength of his gambling genius. Things are looking up and Mike is winning hand after hand from a bunch of cops when the incorrigible Worm shows up and spoils everything. The cops catch Worm dealing off the bottom of the deck. Confiscating all their dough, the boys-in-blue beat them black and blue. Rather than face an even worse beating from Grama, Worm leaves Mike in the lurch.Nobody gives a bad performance in ""Rounders."" Matt Damon evokes more sympathy here than he did in ""Good Will Hunting."" Indeed, these two Damon characters share similarities. They both display genius in their calling. Mike either wins or loses by knowing facial tick of his opponents. The filmmakers beef up Mike's charisma by letting him provide narration. Mike's character suffers his biggest drawback from passivity. The writers don't give Mike much spunk. Matt Damon breathes life into a pretty, colorless character. The scenarists stretch credibility when Mike allows Worm to use him. Something is missing. For all the card sense that he possesses, Mike shows little common sense.Good movies require a beginning, middle, and an ending. ""Rounders"" bogs down in the middle. The movie starts well but stalls out early. The story digresses and wander off onto lateral concerns. ""Rounders"" doesn't end with a bang, but folds without a sight of hope. Ultimately, ""Rounders"" lacks both the psychological tension and depth of the 1974 James Caan movie ""The Gambler"" about a compulsive gambler in the self-destructive those of a wagering addiction. Moreover, ""Rounders"" never mobilizes the competitive spirit of the classic Steve McQueen poker parable ""The Cincinnati Kid.""",Rounders
12,view_and_review,I'm All In,8,24 November 2020,"I didn't know such a thing as the World Series of Poker existed until around '04 or '05. Silly me. ""Rounders"" wasn't about the WSoP, but it was mentioned often enough. ""Rounders"" was about poker and all its minutiae. So much that I'd say about half of it went right over my head.Mike McDermot (Matt Damon) was a law student paying his way through college playing poker games. He was that good. Then he decided to risk all of his money in a high stakes game against Teddy KGB (John Malkovich), a Russian mob boss. He lost.Mike swore off of poker and did a good job keeping away from it until his childhood friend Worm (Edward Norton) reentered his life. Worm was a degenerate cheater with a huge debt. To keep Worm alive Mike would have to get back into poker playing at the risk of losing his long time girlfriend and possibly his education.This move is good. It had to be good if it could hold my attention when I don't know much of anything about poker nor am I at all interested in it. Even though poker was the theme it could have very well been about any other endeavor. It was about one man's competitive drive to be the best and beat the best. It was also about loyalty and allegiance and how such things can be a hindrance when you are loyal to a toxic individual. These are universal themes which everyone can understand whether the object of the characters is poker, becoming president, or opening a lemonade stand.Norton, Damon, and Malkovich were wonderful. They made this movie what it was as much as the script did. Those three can probably do any movie and make it worthwhile.",Rounders
13,anaconda-40658,Damon Goes Full Circle.,6,15 September 2015,"Rounders (1998): Dir: John Dahl / Cast: Matt Damon, Edward Norton, Gretchen Mol, Martin Landau, John Malkovich: Intriguing concept fueled the concept of living dishonestly and the paranoia that follows. Matt Damon plays an exceedingly good card player who gambles away his tuition money but vows to quit his addiction. Edward Norton is released from prison and Damon picks him up and decides to help him raise the 15, 000 that he owes. Fine setup pays little attention to subplots involving college and his relationship ties with a narrated conclusion that doesn't cut it. Tense directing by John Dahl who also made Red Rock West. Production is standard but the casting is strong. Damon is the film's best asset playing someone who once propelled by wrong and returns to it once again with consequences. What occurs eventually his his methods of using it to free himself. Norton plays someone motivated by wrong because that is where he emerges. His solution is to retreat. Gretchen Mol plays Damon's girlfriend who helped him beat his addiction but eventually must deal with his return the only way she can. John Malkovich steals moments competing with Damon and eating Oreo cookies. Much of her story is neglected or unnecessary but she plays it with superb results. Martin Landau has a small but pivotal role as generous law professor. Theme of self analysis comes up aces high. Score: 6 / 10",Rounders
14,The_Void,A good film about a great game,8,13 April 2005,"As a big fan of poker, I was very excited to see Rounders, which is a movie about poker. My excitement increased in the first few minutes when it turned out that the main game in this film is no limit Texas Hold'Em; very much my game. One thing that disappointed me with The Cincinnati Kid was that the central game was 5-card stud, and while stud isn't a bad interpretation of poker; it loses hands down to Texas Hold'Em, a game that Rounders rightly professes to be the only pure style of poker. Poker is the main focus of the movie, but obviously that isn't enough to carry a whole film so there's a story behind all the gambling. Matt Damon is a poker whizz kid who finds himself in trouble after blowing his bankroll to a Russian guy (John Malkovich in a fine campy turn). The trouble increases when Damon's friend 'Worm' (Ed Norton) gets out of jail and lands the pair of them in huge debt. Then there's his girlfriend that doesn't like him playing poker and on the whole things just aren't going right for our protagonist.The film benefits from a troupe of credible actors including the aforementioned John Malkovich, Matt Damon and Ed Norton; but also including the likes of Martin Landau, Famke Janssen and John Turturro. Matt Damon is the lead of the film and does a good job with his role, but he's maybe just a little too pretty to be truly convincing. Don't get me wrong, I like Damon and definitely think he can act; but I think also that gamblers tend to be more convincing when they're a little more rugged than Damon is. The film is definitely at it's best when we're following the poker action, and director John Dahl obviously knows this as a large proportion of the screen time is dedicated to the central game. The film falls down on several counts, however, most notably that it's a little corny and some of the scenes seem overdone, while others are severely under-wrought. The story behind the gambling is interesting enough, but it's a little clichéd and it's one of those films where you just know what's going to happen. Adding to that is the fact that it ends prematurely, and would have been much better if we'd followed Damon's escapades in Las Vegas. Still, this is a very decent movie and fans of poker will find lots to like!",Rounders
15,mm-39,Just another movie,6,5 February 2014,"Rounders is not a bad movie, but does not stand out either. Rounders is about hold 'em poker, and Matt Damon trying to help a friend, Edward Norton who Matt owes. The Norton doesn't seem to learn his lesson and always relies on others' good nature to help him out of it. He uses his friends and does not seem to care. A couple of side stories where Matt ruins a love interest, and his university. The main story line of Rounders is about dealing with, reading, and playing poker with people. The directing, acting, and story is so so! I watched Rounders off a cable channel. Would I watch Rounders again? No! Just okay. Something to do on a cold February late night. Rounders is a six out of ten. Not a good hand which one would have to bluff their way through.",Rounders
16,whpratt1,Very Entertaining Film,8,12 November 2007,"This story deals strictly with card gambling in New York City with all kinds of high rollers and Matt Damon, (Mike McDermott) is a reformed gambler who wants to become a lawyer and at the same time loves his game of cards which occupies most of his brain power. He lives with a young girl from a College of Law named Jo, (Gretchen Mol) who loves Matt very much but his gambling seems to get between this couple and there is a constant struggle. Jo looks through his pants pockets and sees large amounts of money which she calls, ""Gangster Money"" and knows he has been gambling behind her back. There is a good friend of Matt who is in prison named Edward ""Worm"" Murphy and Matt meets him at the prison gates as he is being released from prison. This Worm character is a tricky friend and leads poor Matt into a big mess and ruins his life so to speak. Great entertaining film and if you like cards, you will love this film, great photography through out New York City and some pretty rough looking characters who can do some real damage to the human bodies.

17,MovieAddict2016,"Very underrated character piece, although not without its flaws",8,1 April 2005,"""Rounders"" is about a straight-flying legal student (Matt Damon) who leaves behind his gambling habits to satisfy his moralistic girlfriend. However when his best friend ""Worm"" (Edward Norton) is released from jail, the two embark on a cards-journey that leads them from success to misfortune after Worm is caught cheating and the man who caught him (John Malkovich) wants his money back.Whereas Ben Affleck continues to go downhill after ""Good Will Hunting,"" Matt Damon has striven uphill, taking on daring productions such as ""The Talented Mr. Ripley,"" ""The Bourne Identity"" series, and of course ""Rounders,"" which features one of his best performances. Damon has become typecast as some sort of bad actor in the league of Affleck, but he's much better than his pal, and films like this prove it.Norton is once again superb as one of his characters you love to hate. He's got the character of Worm down pat, and it really elevates the acting (along with Damon) to a level of greatness.The film is directed and written very well, offering realistic dialog and gritty environments. However the flaws of the movie are its long running time (two hours exactly), which could have been shortened, and probably the fact that its card playing is sometimes a bit alienating to the audience.That said, this is still a very underrated movie featuring outstanding performances and a unique spin on gambling flicks. Worth watching at least once in a lifetime.",Rounders
18,KineticSeoul,Just watching people gamble can be a lot of fun,7,22 December 2011,The movie has gambling parts but it has other good elements that had my interest most of the way through. Overall this is a movie to sort of be invested in since it keeps the same tone all the way through. It doesn't get better as it progresses but it's a fun thrill ride. I was hesitant about seeing Matt Damon playing a good card player but he was actually really good in this. Especially Edward Norton who is a card player that doesn't necessarily gamble but sees a mark and goes for it. Gambling can be an addiction and the story in this is about how far they fall and have to gamble there way back up. Especially because of the situation they end up in. I found the beginning to be intriguing and entertaining how it shows how certain people gamble and read each other while playing. Some of the psychological aspects in this movie was interesting and entertaining as well. This movie carried the same entertaining tone from beginning to end although it becomes a bit predictable as it progresses and you can see what is going to happen next. Also although John Malkovich only has few scenes but for some reason I liked watching the few scenes he was in playing the mad Russian card player KGB.7.5/10,Rounders

This movie makes it hard to root for the protagonist, and the story really doesn't draw you in until the final third. I bet this was probably more impressive in the 90s.",Rounders
21,secondtake,Well made but eventually a bit thin for anyone not a poker fan,6,25 May 2013,"Rounders (1998)A charming idea, almost romanticized: if you are young, clever, good looking, and savvy at playing poker you can be ultra cool and maybe even wealthy. That makes for a pretty good movie, if not a very accurate reality. It isn't quite enough to keep two hours going, however, and so the big picture here is to enjoy what it has.A quick comparison might be made to ""The Hustler"" and related pool shark movies. And like that classic, ""Rounders"" is about charming deceit. Matt Damon is the main man here, an ex-poker champ who has ""gone straight"" until his former partner in crime, Ed Norton, gets out of jail and ropes him back into the thrills and malevolence. Like the pool movies, and like the glitzier and more ambitious ""Oceans"" movies, personalities matter most. The setting, the glint of money, and most of all the plots matter less than you'd think.So everything is pretty good along those lines, partly because Damon is fun to be with and Norton is simply terrific. An embarrassing appearance in the beginning and end of the movie by an overacting John Malkovich gets in the way of Damon's performance, however. And the general attempt at creating a bunch of bad guys behind the scenes is filled with thin clichés and mediocre acting. This is the result of having to make more of the story that was ever there. The main idea--that the two leads get into money trouble and have to earn a ton of cash in a few days of wild poker games--is eventually actually a bit of a bore. The gamesmanship is always interesting, of course, but the impetus behind it grows old. The addition of Martin Landau as a Jewish lawyer who gives Damon a mitzvah as a kind of honor paid to continue a favor once given him is a touching part of the larger plot, making you wish there was more of this somehow, more of something genuine and a bit different.It might not have helped that I recently saw ""Croupier"" with a young Clive Owen as a poker dealer, because that movie, whatever its simplicity and other limitations, actually made the poker scenes more real for me. In fact, one problem with ""Rounders"" is you never get to actually sense the betting itself, and the cards--the playing and the strategies of playing--are glossed over with some tossing of chips and flipping of cards, all in a vague muddle.I did enjoy watching overall, but it left me a little disappointed and restless.",Rounders
22,Thanos_Alfie,Gambling...,6,30 May 2020,"""Rounders"" is a Crime - Drama movie in which we watch a young man helping his friend who was recently released from prison with his gambling problem but soon he finds himself returning to gamble even more than he used to do in the past.I liked this movie because it was very interesting due to its plot that consisted of some plot twists that I did not expect and it also had many in tense moments. The interpretations of both Matt Damon who played as Mike McDermott and Edward Norton who played as Worm were simply amazing and the contrast of those two characters made the movie even more interesting. The direction which was made by John Dahl was very good and he presented very well the differences between the two main characters of the movie while he presented the lives of both of them and the difficulties the had faced. To sum up, I believe that ""Rounders"" is a good and interesting movie and I recommend everyone to watch it.",Rounders
23,Dr_Coulardeau,Trite in all possible ways,7,24 February 2008,"A small film on gambling. It does not really bring anything about gambling itself as an addiction, as a total lack of judgment and reason. And the end of the film is both a total illusion because you never really win in gambling because winning is only there to make you lose even more, and a fatal last move that announces the final descent into hell, a hell that is named Las Vegas. The only strange element, original element, is the Jewish dimension introduced by the judge who should have been a rabbi and couldn't because he could not see God. He actually lent money to that poor Mike knowing that Mike was going to gamble with it and was killing his dream of ever being anything noticeable in a court of justice apart from eventually being an accused or a convicted criminal.

24,Floated2,Interesting take on Poker,7,28 December 2016,"Rounders sees Matt Damon starring as Mike McDermott, a young law student. Mike is a master at sizing up his fellow players by observing their tells. In the film's prologue, Mike goes up against a formidable Russian player with mob ties nicknamed Teddy KGB (John Malkovich). He ends up losing his entire $30,000 tuition to the Russian. Afterwards, Mike promises his girlfriend Jo (Gretchen Mol) that he'll give up the game for good and get himself back on track. He is able to get a position as a law clerk thanks to his friendship with Professor Petrofsky (Martin Landau), who is also his mentor.However, this happens to only be the beginning. Once we observed, later things go reasonably well until Mike's best friend Worm (Edward Norton) is released from prison. Mike and Worm had pulled off numerous poker scams in the past together, many of which played upon Worm's ability to trick shuffle a deck, thereby dispensing the good cards in an advantageous way. Worm exits the prison ready to pick up right where he left off. He's still in debt from before his sentencing and the interest has accumulated greatly. Mike refuses to play again, but agrees to help Worm get set up with some games. Before long though, Worm has gotten himself in more trouble. The only way to save him from his debtors is for Mike to win enough money to pay the debt.The film is mainly solely carried by Matt Damon, where Ed Norton does give a good performance (although irritating character) as well, but as seen in the film, his character is supporting (not as a co-lead as some would expect or suggest). The film does drag on at some points but nonetheless, it still is exciting at getting a solid glance at the Poker world.",Rounders
25,johnnyboyz,A Sports film-come-Neo Noir that lacks conflict and enough noir to be anything great and yet remains an entertaining tale.,6,14 November 2007,"In one sense, Rounders is like nothing I've ever seen; in another sense it's like everything I've ever seen. Director John Dahl may be famous for his love of noir with The Last Seduction springing to mind; a sort of cross between a typical 1990s heist film and the classic that is Double Indemnity but with Rounders Dahl doesn't stick to what he loves most enough to make the film anything too fantastic. Let's be honest: Rounders is a sports film and no, it's not about the sport/baseball hybrid 'rounders'; it's about poker which in itself sparks some debate surrounding whether or not it's actually a sport or just a mere form of gambling. In my book, it's a sport since it takes brains and skill to win at the game whereas something like wrestling, which is fake for the best part, can be considered of the sporting variety.So there you have it: a sports film directed by a man in love with noir which is still evident in this film and revolving around an engaging plot whilst at the same time containing good acting. What's clever here is that the director is challenging us and poker as a whole into contemplating whether Poker is a sport. The film follows a familiar sports narrative, ie; it has the hero with nothing to loose; the disgraced mentor who is able to pick the hero back up onto his feet; a winning and/or training montage and of course 'the final showdown with the villain' only in these stories it takes place on a sports field (or a Poker table, in this case).During the film, my mind kept harking back to Paul Newman's 1961 sports film The Hustler, revolving around another popular American sport: 9 ball pool, since although both films are decades apart in terms of film-making; the way the story is told and the way events play out remain the same. I'll never forget Newman's character playing frame after frame with Minnesota Fats and then leaving the hall a dejected and tired man after loosing so heavily; the same sort of way Mike McDermott (Damon) does so in Rounders. What follows is painful and eventful uphill struggle involving loved ones becoming detached, hard times coming to the surface and lots and lots of the respective sport being played  in Rounders, this aids McDermott since it enables to get him closer to the powers that be (Abe Petrovsky  Landau) regarding his education. This not only gives us the feeling that time is passing and relationships are developing but is a great way to not only introduce a character but to also demonstrate what a skilled Poker player McDermott is  needless to say, it happens early on in the film.Although a sports film as such, the essence of noir can't help but worm its way into the frame. What I couldn't see was the point of it all: There are gangsters of the Russian kind; lots of people smoking; voice-overs; gambling and a dystopian urban setting. Fine you think, but the femme fatale character of Petra (Janssen) appears and then disappears without too much of an incident and without too much evidence to suggest she's even a femme fatale in the first place, there is no real conflict for the middle period of about forty minutes apart from the usual montages of poker games being won although sometimes we'll be shown the games; often when they go wrong (the match with the sheriffs is a good example). I'm not sure if Rounders was supposed to be a neo-noir of sorts because although it has the basis to be one, it doesn't utilise enough conventions of the genre to be considered one and if it's not a noir then it is most definitely a sports film; albeit a rather average one. I liked the way we are supposed to feel for McDermott; I liked the way Edward Norton does some 'acting within acting' or playing a 'character within a character' and the way characters and incident float in and out of McDermott's life was sometimes effective but Rounders is a film that relies too heavily on generic substance and star power to be truly memorable even if it does raise the debate about whether poker should be a sport or not.",Rounders

27,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"""Rounders"" aces the slick and smooth-talking approach to gambling drama",7,7 July 2008,"""Rounders"" is a star-studded drama that glorifies the game of poker and over-dramatizes the heck out of the gambling lifestyle, all while dishing out ""poker is life"" metaphors like $5 dollar chips and providing an overdose of slick and arrogant narrative dialogue by way of the prince of the east coast, Matt Damon himself. Call it an exaggeration, but that's exactly how ""Rounders"" creators David Levien and Brian Koppelman up the ante in this film. If you're a poker lover, you'll love this film and if you're not, well you'll still probably enjoy it, but not as much as a real rounder would.Levien and Koppelman, who debuted with ""Rounders"" and have since teamed up for a variety of mobster and especially gambling related films (including TV show ""Tilt""), are masters at jazzing things up. While ""Rounders"" doesn't exactly delve into the glamorous side of gambling, it acts like it does and it packs some excitement into a film that would otherwise be just another movie about guys with gambling problems trying to repay debt.Matt Damon and Edward Norton star as Mike and Lester aka ""Worm,"" two boarding school buddies who bottom line know how to win at poker. Mike, the true protagonist, is the more- level headed one (he's in law school and with a girlfriend (Gretchen Mol)) but he is still an ambitious gambler who finds himself losing everything to a neurotic Oreo-loving Russian mob dude played by the multi-talented John Malkovich. His buddy Worm is fresh out of prison, having done time for credit card fraud, and he has no other goals but to play more poker to make the money he needs to pay off previous gambling debts. Mike has quit poker, but he feels the itch and wants to help his friend.The cast also includes John Turturro, Famke Jenssen and Martin Landau, all actors who could get top billing in a film today. While they're all good, it's Damon and Norton that are able to really work the slick and snappy dialogue and also play it up for drama and not just kicks. These guys create some serious problems for themselves about halfway through the film and keep facing moral dilemmas despite their seemingly unstoppable poker prowess. It actually gives the film a lot of strength despite the pompous air it gives off.By the end, however, ""Rounders"" does turn back around and become more about the cool, edgy side of gambling, leaving a lot of the deeper questions out to dry while it hits you with what it thinks is an intense ending that proves to be too long and morally objectionable. Not that anyone is the authority on morals, but the film goes for the tagline mentality of ""play the hand you're dealt"" and not ""hey, you should stop gambling because you're $15,000 in debt. Despite realistic turns throughout and giving off the vibe that it's going to be more down to earth, the film goes for the super-smooth finish and it just feels like a waste. Other than getting long toward the end, though, it's certainly entertaining as slick usually is and the two star vehicles really help the film stand out.",Rounders

31,NateWatchesCoolMovies,The premium poker movie,7,11 May 2016,"John Dahl's Rounders is the premier poker movie, an utterly charming, never too serious and surprisingly slight look at the lives of several very different individuals whose lives revolve around the game in New York City. The main focus lands on two young men who are fast friends, yet reside on somewhat opposite sides of the responsibility coin. Poker prodigy Mike (Matt Damon) has since given up his art after a soul crushing loss to local Russian bigwig Teddy KGB (John Malkovich). He's content to simmer in solitude with his perky girlfriend (Gretchen Mol, who never fails to convince me that she's Samantha Mathis until I double check on IMDb). Right in time to disrupt his quiet life is cocky street rat Worm (Edward Norton), fresh out of prison and looking for the type of trouble that landed him there in the first place. It's to long before he's racked up some serious debt to dangerous people with ties to Teddy KGB, and Mike is forced to come out of retirement and risk everything he has once again, this time for his friend. The poker scenes are staged with meticulous eye for detail and mannerisms in attempt to put you at the same table as the players, and it's nifty to see each acting style played to the microscopic hilt as Dahl maintains patient focus on his work. Norton is appropriately scuzzy with just a dollop of endearing, scrappy charm and Damon fills the protagonist's shoes very well. It's Malkovich, however, who pulls the stops out and is my favourite character of the piece. With a muddy Russian accent that rivals his french one from Johnny English, a lazily snarky streak with just a hint of intimidation and a bag of oreos at his side without fail, he's a hoot, holler and a half as the life of the poker party. Sexy Famke Janssen has as great bit as as shady chick with eyes for Damon and connections with dodgy folks, expertly playing the half sweet and seductive, half menacing game. Watch for topnotch work from John Turturro, Josh Pais, Michael Rispoli, Josh Mostel, Adam Lefevre, David Zayas, Goran Visjnic, Lenny Clarke and Martin Landau in an earnest turn as a kindly professor who looks out for Mike. It's short, sweet, concisely paced, tightly written, flawlessly acted and wonderfully entertaining stuff.",Rounders

33,aidanratesmovies,"Flawed, but an entertaining and well acted film",8,24 April 2020,"With some great performances and a consistently entertaining premise, Rounders feels like it has the potential to be a great drama, but unfortunately falls short on a number of accounts. Matt Damon and Ed Norton are great together on screen, and I wish most of all we got to see more of Norton's character, but instead things left rather unsatisfyingly with him. The film is very excellent with its pacing, but at times can prove to be frustrating. For a lot of the good things in the film, there seem to be countermeasures for each of them. At times this is what makes the film so frustrating, is that is has so many good elements throughout, but keeps canceling itself out, as the characters do, after every good quality it shows. That being said, the film is rather well rounded with its story, no pun intended, and proves to have some rather clever moments throughout its runtime- despite its downtime to increase the length. In the end, Rounders is still a decent time. It's an entertaining card playing movie, that doesn't have quite as much as it thinks up its sleeve. It's acting is impressive, and its characters are quite interesting to follow, but at times it can fall victim to being just a bit too pretentious.

Minimum buy in twenty five thousand dollars a game like this doesn't come around often outside the casinos, the stakes attract rich flounders and they in turn attract the sharks. Each player is dealt two cards face down then five cards are dealt face up. These are known as community cards everyone can use to make the best five card hand. The key to the game is playing the man, not the cards. There's no other game in which fortunes can change so much from hand to hand. A brilliant player can get a strong hand, crack go on tilt and lose his mind along with every chip in front of him. This is why The World Series of Poker is decided on a no limit hold'em table. Pro's won't play no limit. They can't handle the swings but there are others, like Doyle Brunson, consider no limit the only pure game left, ""Like Papa Wallenda said, 'Life is on the wire, the rest is just waiting.'""This is the audience's introduction to the underground gambling world of ""Rounders."" Director John Dahl was on a roll when he made this film. He'd previously directed three amazing film noir throwbacks with ""Kill Me Again,"" ""Red Rock West,"" and ""The Last Seduction,"" each one better than the last (he did falter with one sci-fi throwback ""Unforgettable,"" but it's still entertaining). Dahl reached a career high with ""Rounders,"" which is the definitive gambling film. There are some great movies set in the gambling world, like ""The Cooler,"" ""The Good Thief"" (a remake of ""Bob Le Fambeur""), or ""California Split,"" but those films were not so much about the game and the gambling subculture as was this film. ""Rounders"" tells the story of Mike, Matt Damon, who's putting himself through law school playing Texas hold 'em, much to the consternation of his girlfriend, Gretchen Mol, who gets him to swear off gambling after one particularly bad loss. That is until his old buddy Worm, a terrific scene stealing Edward Norton, gets released from prison and sucks Damon back into the world of illegal underground gambling. Norton quickly finds himself in trouble over old debts he owns and in danger from John Malcovich, in one of my favorite of his performances, which is saying something, as Teddy KGB, a Russian mob connected local loan shark and underground gambling parlor operator, who Mike makes the mistake of vouching for Worm's debt. The story of Mike trying to balance his straight life as a student and helping out his friend in the underground criminal gambling world is terrific, but it's the film's portrayal of this underground gambling subculture that's most interesting about the film. Besides doing a great job explaining the game itself and how the best players think about the game (there's on great little scene when Mike is rewatching an old VHS copy of the World Series of Poker and talking about Johnny Chan's play at the with a fellow rounder), the audience gets an insider look at how this secret world operates and the type of people who populate it, which ranges from skilled players like Mike who are willing to risk it all, to skilled cheaters like his friend Worm, to dangerous gangsters like Teddy KGB or his various thugs, or the workers at these gambling dens like the pretty Petra (the underused Famke Janssen), to ""grinders"" like John Turturro's Joey Knish, who Damon describes as, ""a New York legend. He's been a ""rounder"", earning his living at cards since he was 19 years old."" Knish is an older guy now, with a family and a responsibility, who plays poker a whole lot safer. At one point in the film, Damon chides Knish, saying, ""You see all the angles, and you never have the fucking stones to play one."" to which Knish strongly replies, ""Stones? You little punk! I'm not playing for the thrill of fucking victory here! I owe rent, alimony, child support. I play for money. My kids eat. I got stones enough not to chase card actions of fucking pipe dreams of winning the world series on ESPN. But about the money I've got to turn my back. I've got to say no."" There's great moments like this throughout the film, such as when all of the degenerate gambler characters are in an Atlantic City casino and work unsuspecting rubes who have the unfortunate luck to sit at their table. As Mike narrates:These two have no idea what they're about to walk into, down here to have a good time they figure, ""why not give poker a try? after all how different could it be from the home games they've played their whole lives?"" All the luck in the world isn't going to change things for these guys, they're simply over matched, we're not playing together but then again we're not playing against each other. They wear their ""tells"" like signs around their necks, facial tics, nervous fingers the hand over the mouth, the way a cigarette is smoked, little unconscious gestures that reveal the cards in their hands. We catch everything if a fish acts strong he's bluffing, if he acts weak his got a hand, it's that simple. It's like the nature channel... you don't see Piranhas eating themselves, do you?There's another great little scene where Mike reads a table of his law school professors within seconds, amazing the group by saying ""You were lookin' for that third three, but you forgot that Professor Green folded on Fourth Street and now you're representing that you have it. The DA made his two pair, but he knows they're no good. Judge Kaplan was trying to squeeze out a diamond flush but he came up short and Mr. Eisen is futilely hoping that his queens are going to stand up. So like I said, the Dean's bet is $20."" Later, Professor Petrovsky, the great Martin Landau asks Mike how he did it. Professor Petrovsky: I know a magician doesn't reveal his secrets.
Mike McDermott: I'm not a magician.
Professor Petrovsky: If it wasn't ""magic"", how did you know what everyone held?
Mike McDermott: It's a combination of things: I was watching when the cards came out, that's just an old habit with me, it's like breathing
Professor Petrovsky: Watch the cards?
Mike McDermott: I watch the cards but I also watch the player react to the cards. That's how I knew the DA made his two pair and judge Kaplan missed the flush, I was watching their eyes when they checked their river cards, their faces tell you everything.
Professor Petrovsky: (Confused) You watch the man? I never knew you had to calculate so much in cards.
Mike McDermott: Here's some advice, just play premium hands, you only start with jacks or better if its good enough to call you've also got to be in there raising, tight but aggressive and I do mean aggressive, you've got to think of it as a war.
Professor Petrovsky: You're officially never invited to our game again.
Mike McDermott: I don't blame you, put a guy like me in that game, cards don't even matter I'll play it blind.Mike's voice over narration is filled with great tidbits that reek of authenticity (although I admittedly don't know all that much about gambling, but it sounded real to me), such as:In ""Confessions of a Winning Poker Player,"" Jack King said, ""Few players recall big pots they have won, strange as it seems, but every player can remember with remarkable accuracy the outstanding tough beats of his career."" It seems true to me, cause walking in here, I can hardly remember how I built my bankroll, but I can't stop thinking of how I lost it.Or You can shear a sheep many times, but skin him only once.OrIt's immoral to let a sucker keep his money. 
Or even Mike's girlfriend gets in on it when finally breaking up with him and saying:Mike, I learned it from you. You always told me this was the rule. Rule number one: Throw away your cards the moment you know they can't win. Fold the fucking hand.The film is filled with beautifully terse dialogue such as this that borders on sounding almost as good as David Mamet (Mamet wrote his own film about con men and gambling, ""House of Game,"" which everyone should watch). The film's smart script by David Levien and Brian Koppelman is a major element of the film's success, as are the film's many strong performance, led by Damon, Norton, and Malcovich, as well as strong supporting performances from Tuturro, Landau, Janssen, and Josh Mostel, Lenny Clarke, and Michael Rispoli as well. Also worth acknowledging is the director John Dahl, who brings a terrific sense of style to the film, creating a moody backroom setting that feels quite real and gives the audience the sense they are peeking behind the curtain to see something secret. Besides telling a great story about gambling, ""Rounders"" also works as a fascinating subculture film, meaning films that give you glimpse into a group of people who you previously never understood or knew existed. These types of films, even when the narrative is lacking can be fascinating. Some of the better examples of this type of film are Neo-Nazi's in ""American History X"" or 80s punks in ""Suburbia"" or heroine addicts in ""Trainspotting"" or even young wealthy priveleged intellectuals in Whit Stillman movies like ""Metropolitan, ""Barcelona, or ""The Last Days of Disco"").

38,p-stepien,Why the same five guys are always gunning for the Poker World Championship...,6,10 December 2012,"A game of luck or of character and skill? Poker in the mind of most is the latter, and to the majority of people this is undoubtedly the truth. However when the stakes are high, knowledge, calm and cognisance is key to victory - professionality has no place for luck. When Mike McDermott (Matt Damon) attempts to advance to the top grade by beating Russian card Mafioso Teddy KGB (John Malkovich), he ultimately ends up losing everything, including his college tuition fee. This pushes him to drop out of rounding and focus on law studies. The situation changes however when his childhood buddy Lester 'Worm' Murphy (Edward Norton) gets released from prison and soon attempts to engulf him back into the scene...""Rounders"" is an admirable character piece, where Damon and Norton show off their incredible acting chops, delivering a riveting story, which fails however to convey any moral, instead giving each and every character his due based on likability. Nonetheless despite having the majority of the movie focused around cards and occasional grifting, the story remains enticing. Even though discussions about Poker may have as well been in Chinese, the movie manages to flesh out the game and thankfully opts out of any miraculous 'magical last hand', instead focusing on the pure mechanics of professional cards - more psychology and skill, than gambling. The main gripe lays with the movies lack of message, unless glossing over questionable behaviour by the main character by suggesting that 'this is who he is, so its OK'.",Rounders
39,intelearts,One of the best card films of all time,9,9 March 2009,"I guess the test is this: I've seen Rounders four or five times; I saw it in the cinema when it was first released and thought it brilliant then. If anything now it's even better.Why? Because it's a film about the game, not a sponsor, and it has first class performances and first class directing. It wasn't high rollled by an internet site looking to cash in on the poker craze; it's just a grimy, grim, and effective film about poker and poker players with a little back story but mainly strong performances especially from Norton who really is Worm.The story of the reformed gambler who finds himself sucked back in to pay off debts that aren't his is very well handled and one of its great points is that it's all done without melodrama.Just a great film about gambling, New York, and the guys who play Poker. For my money as good as the Cincinnati Kid and certainly no other card film in the last 10 years has come close.Class and classic",Rounders
40,krocheav,Rounders - Turn The Next Card As Fast As You Can,3,23 October 2019,"If there's a movie or its stars, that's lost to the late '90's it's this one and its crew. This grotty swear-fest is so typical of Matt Damon and Edward Norton that it plays out like a cliché - they simply walk through their roles emulating themselves. If you're a fan of these somewhat overrated cardboard-cut-outs then you may be 'entertained' (although it's stretching the word). And, they get plenty of financial assistance for their ole mate, Harvey Weinstein. Nasty characters and sleazy situations overrun this miserable experience - leaving the feeling of needing a shower by the end. Viewers addicted to gambling or card-shark movies, may feel at home with these witless lowlifes but ultimately they prove unworthy of empathy or concern.Some may even feel they've just spent 2 Hrs with characters the world would be better off without. Also featured in the acting high-jinks is John Malkovich, who overdoes his chocolate biscuit eating (supposedly 'Russian') card-shark-guru, to borderline laughable proportions. John Turturro on the other hand (no pun intended) fares best at attempting to build on a character, along with interesting Gretchen Mol as the suffering girlfriend.

41,DeeNine-2,Why Do You Think They Make Them Round?,8,7 March 1999,"The chips, that is. This is easily the best poker movie I've ever seen. It is the only one that is authentic both technically and psychologically. Much of the plot is familiar and could be (and has been) wrapped around other themes and sleazy backdrops. The ending, is however original as far as I know, and psychologically true, just ask any rounder.Part of the power of the script comes from the technical help of Mike Caro and other professional poker players. I know the triptych themes of (1) buddy for buddy (until it becomes ridiculous--as Matt Damon was for Ed Norton), and (2) honesty among poker players, and (3) The Game and male-bonding before women are themes espoused by Mike Caro and many in the profession.Matt Damon is very winning in the starring role, and Norton is properly despicable as one of life's losers, and John Malkovich is riveting as Teddy KGB in spite of what some might say about his accent.Incidentally, guys, Damon cashed out $60,000, I believe, but he started with $10,000 from Martin Landau (how the man has aged!), played head up for it all and won = $20,000, played head up for it all again and won = $40,000. Had he started with the $15,000 he owed (which he didn't because he could only get $10,000 from Landau) the numbers would have come out right: wins $15,000 = $30,000, wins $30,000 = $60,000.But hey that's a small thing when Director John Dahl and company get the main point right, which is it takes courage to win at poker, and Mike McDermott had that.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""

42,sme_no_densetsu,Undeniably cool,7,26 November 2008,"""Rounders"" seems to have become somewhat of a cult classic since its release a decade ago. Depending on who you ask, it either played a part in sparking the recent vogue for poker or it benefited directly from it.In the film, a ruined poker player (Matt Damon) gets drawn back into the game when his ne'er-do-well buddy (Edward Norton) runs into trouble with a loan shark. With this premise, the film then takes us into the world of high stakes poker and life as a rounder.The cast is a big part of why this film is worth watching. Damon & Norton were still fresh faces in 1998 but time has shown that you could not ask for a better pairing. Both actors are on the top of their game and their performances go a long way in selling the experience. The supporting cast isn't bad, either. You've got Martin Landau, John Malkovich (complete with ridiculous 'Russian' accent), John Turturro and others providing quality support.The film's look is pretty impressive, too. John Dahl's direction is bold and the cinematography is continually appealing as we move from underground dives to Atlantic City and everywhere in between. The soundtrack is pretty good too, with some well-chosen music that fits the picture nicely.All of this makes for a film that's worthy of its cult status. Is it destined to become a classic on the scale of ""The Hustler""? Certainly not, but it's a nifty little spin on similar subject matter.",Rounders
43,seymourblack-1,"Friendship, Debts & Loyalty",8,20 December 2018,"This fascinating insight into addiction illustrates how a couple of compulsive gamblers suffer in different ways because of their shared obsession with playing high-stakes poker. The sheer excitement and danger that they derive from this endeavour is something that they can't replicate in any other part of their lives and so it becomes the most important thing that they live for and everything and everyone else that they care about, ultimately, has to take a back seat.As part of his plan to become a world champion, brilliant poker player and law student Mike McDermott (Matt Damon) had attempted to build up enough money to play in the World Series in Las Vegas by playing against Russian mobster and underground club owner, Teddy KGB (John Malkovich). However, after losing everything he had (which amounted to $30,000), he took on a job as a truck driver and promised his live-in girlfriend Jo (Gretchen Mol) that he'd give up gambling for good and concentrate on his law studies.When his old gambling partner and best friend, Lester ""Worm"" Murphy (Edward Norton) gets released from prison, Mike goes to meet him and almost immediately gets back into the gambling scene. This action costs him his relationship with Jo and leads to him having to give up his law studies. Mike feels tremendously indebted to Worm because his refusal to rat on his friend when he was imprisoned saved Mike from having to serve time. Knowing that Worm ran up some debts before his incarceration, Mike arranges for him to use $2,000 of his credit at ""The Chesterfield Club"" to help him win some money to make his repayments. After winning $8,000, Worm takes the money but also doesn't pay back the $2,000 credit that Mike had extended him. Later that night, at a strip club, Worm is approached by a repulsive thug called Grama (Michael Rispoli) who explains that he's bought out all of Worm's pre-prison debts amounting to $25,000 and now wants his money back. After trying to stall Grama, Worm gets badly beaten up, relieved of his $10,000 and given five days to pay off the remaining $15,000.Although they're both victims of the same addiction, Mike and Worm have very different attitudes to playing poker. Mike, who's adept at reading faces and identifying tells, knows that it's not a game of luck and genuinely tries to win by being more skilful than his opponents. Worm, on the other hand, is an inveterate cheat who hustles at every opportunity and takes a philosophical attitude to the regular beatings that he suffers as a consequence. When the two friends work together to try to win back enough cash to pay off Grama within the set time limit, their efforts are undermined by Worm's reckless behaviour and Mike is left with only one option to set things straight and this, ironically, brings him back into a high-stakes game which he can't afford to lose, against Teddy KGB.Featuring a group of well drawn characters and set in an interesting subculture, this tale of friendship, debts and loyalty is gripping right from the start. Its jazzy score and wonderful cinematography make it very atmospheric and its slang terms e.g. ""three stacks of high society"" ($30,000) and ""juice"" (interest payable on a loan), add colour and authenticity to the action. Impressively, it's also full of strong performances.As a basically decent guy who loses a lot because of his addiction, Matt Damon is very believable and Edward Norton is both funny and irritating as the totally untrustworthy Worm who consistently puts himself and Mike into deeper and deeper trouble. John Turturro as Joey Knish provides the movie's best supporting performance as a cautious gambler who tries to help Mike to make better decisions and there are also notable contributions from Martin Landau and the ultra-eccentric John Malkovich.",Rounders
44,baumer,One of the most under rated films ever!,10,11 April 2005,"Rounders is nothing short of hypnotic. It is a film that introduced me and many others to the surreal world of poker. High stakes, Texas Hold Em, winner take all poker. For those unfamiliar with the game, not only is this a perfect tutorial to understand the game, but this is a movie that will entertain you right to the very end.I like to think that this is just like Rocky. Matt Damon plays Mike McDermott, just like Stallone played Rocky. He has all the talent in the world but he needs to find a way to harness it and get the right opportunity. KGB is a little like Appollo Creed and John Tuturro is like Mickey in some ways. But enough of the comparisons of Rocky.What makes Rounders so compelling is the interpersonal relationships in the film, no doubt, but let's face it, what really makes the film as vibrant and energetic as it is, is the poker scenes. We are introduced to several games here, namely Omaha, Omaha Hi Lo, 7 Card Stud and of course Texas Hold Em. According to Mike, Texas No Limit is the Cadillac of all poker games. He of course got that info from reading books by some of the poker greats such as Phil Helmuth, Amarillo Slim and of course The Godfather of poker, Doyle Brunson. Great detail is spent on the feel of poker in this film. When you are in the poker rooms, you can smell the smoke, taste the mustiness of the air and you can feel the emotions that the players feel. It really is a masterful job by Dahl to convey these emotions. And full credit has to be give to the screenwriters to know the lingo, to mollify us with terms like ""flop"", ""river"", ""rags"" and ""bicycle"". Rounders helped introduce me to this nefarious world and just like many others before me, I am hooked. Rounders can take credit for that.What also must be mentioned here is the performances. Like many of the reviewers before me, I was awed by the absolute mastery of these characters by Damon, Norton, Malkovich, Turturro and Landau. My favourite performance is that of John Malkovich. He plays a Russian mobster called KGB. He is a master poker player and in the beginning scene, he takes all of Mike's bankroll as he hits a full house on fourth street, to cripple Mike's smaller boat. Malkovich is a master. He can play any role and he proves it in spades here. Think of his performance in a film like In The Line of Fire or in Of Mice and Men and this is about as diametric from those roles as you can get. There is not one second in the film when you don't believe that he is a Russian mobster with a propensity for gambling. If this film would have been more recognized back in 98, he could have received an Oscar nomination. He is that good. Matt Damon is really a fine actor and this film, while not as known as some of this others, is really a layered performance and one of his best. He plays the young prodigal son here with absolute zeal. Damon has to be one of the best actors working today and seeing as this was one of his first performances after Good Will Hunting, you have to give him that much more credit for taking on such an esoteric role. Kudos to him.Rounders has grown in reputation over the years to the point where a special edition DVD with the likes of Helmuth, Johnny Chan, Chris ""Jesus"" Ferguson and 2003 WSOP champion Chris Moneymaker providing some excellent and enlightening commentary on the track. If you love this film, it is imperative that you pick up the SE DVD. It will enhance the experience for you and will help you appreciate the film that much more. It is fun and exciting to hear the 4 of them laugh when Mike finally busts KGB using Johnny Chen's methods from his first win in the World Series of Poker.

45,blott2319-1,"Not great, but still watchable and fun",6,16 September 2020,"I remember back in the 1990s when Texas Hold 'Em Poker reached its pinnacle of popularity. I was even sucked into watching some matches on TV because I was fascinated by the way the professionals could manipulate a table of opponents and win big. Rounders was probably made when all this was big news, to capitalize on the craze. I think the first problem with the movie was that, despite the popularity of the game at the time, they felt the need to talk down to the audience and play to the people that know next to nothing about poker. There are long stretches of this movie, including 90% of the voice-over, that felt like taking an introductory class on Texas Hold 'Em. I'm sure some audience members would appreciate the help understanding, but for me it felt rudimentary and tedious.That being said, I was still excited by the world they built in Rounders. It is intriguing to see how these guys manage to find games where they can make money, and it is also interesting to learn some of the dangers that await those who play for high stakes. Matt Damon plays a relatable character, and even though his girlfriend is always in the right, you still can appreciate that there's a logic in him pursuing something that he excels at as much as poker. Edward Norton is always perfect to play the unreliable sleazebag, and he delivers that in spades here. It's almost to an extreme where you can't comprehend how Damon was ever friends with this guy, but there's still something likable under all the irresponsible nonsense. John Malkovich, on the other hand, did go to the extreme with his performance and it's almost laughably ridiculous.I had a problem with how much of Rounders is made up of our main character always struggling. It's hard to take after a while when it seems that everything is falling apart around him. However, it allows us as an audience to forgive him for returning to the game that is the one thing he feels he can control in his life. But I will reiterate that everything Gretchen Mol's character says in the film is 100% right, and if this was reality instead of a movie, the main character would have all the signs of a self-destructive gambling addiction. It's probably not the best thing that this movie doesn't address how dangerous that is, but I'm not someone who suffers from it so I can't say whether it would act as a trigger for others who do have a problem. There's a solid story in Rounders, and I enjoyed the excitement of the poker games as if they were real. I wouldn't say this is the best movie on the subject, but it's one I'm glad I've seen and I might even watch it again sometime.",Rounders

I had no interest in seeing Rounders, but seeing as how it's now a movie in my collection I felt obligated to watch it.It's not a bad movie in any way, but I was right about it having little appeal to me. The storyline is kind of weak- Damon's card playing character gets crushed by John Malkovich and gives up on the game, until his girlfriend dumps him. This makes him free to go back to playing- so the girl is portrayed as just a ball and chain, really. He has little confidence but eventually goes up against Malkovich again, and unsurprisingly this time he wins.Conveying some drama in card playing is achieved, and I think Edward Norton did a good job in this movie as a card player who suddenly becomes a bad card player, and gets Damon into a lot of trouble. Still, as a person who's not a poker enthusiast (although I did play years ago), on a subjective level this movie is of little interest and I'm out.",Rounders
48,classicalsteve,Put Your Money on Rounders: Best Film Yet About Poker Players,10,17 August 2007,"Towards the beginning of the film, Mike McDermott (Matt Damon) chats with his girlfriend and fellow law student (Gretchen Mol) about his world of poker-playing, and she says that she can't believe that her boyfriend associates with someone named ""Worm"" (Edward Norton). In many ways, this short discourse describes largely what the story is about. It centers around the two worlds of Mike McDermott. There is Mike McDermott, law student, who habituates the very demanding and yet predictable world of professors and classmates at a nameless law school, maybe Columbia or NYU. And there is Mike McDermott, poker player or ""rounder"", who inhabits the world of card sharks which seems like another planet when compared to the world of the law school. Much of the movie is about McDermott's straddling these two worlds and realizing that he may have to choose one or the other.This film is not about poker playing in the sense of strategy, tactics, folding, bluffing, etc, or at least we receive very little insight into the poker strategist's mind, except during the opening sequence. Instead, which is maybe a better focus, we learn about the world of the poker player. Where he plays, where he doesn't play, whom he plays, and what he's trying to accomplish. We learn about the different secret games and the strange characters that populate this other dimension which seems on the periphery of society.Joey Knish (John Turturro) is the ""rounder's rounder"" who plays poker for a living and is one of the few level-headed people among these cut-throats. Often he tries to guide the young McDermott and steer him away from the deadlier side of the game. Teddy KGB (John Malkovich), whose nickname refers to his high position in the Russian mafia, owns a strange underground poker facility that you won't find in the yellow pages. And the creme-de-la-creme is ""Worm"", played with angst and nervous energy by Edward Norton, who is both a brilliant poker player but a reckless cheat who deals ""hangars"" even when he's winning. (A hangar"" is a cheated deal in which certain cards are dealt from the bottom of the deck to a particular player or players to either advantage or disadvantage their hand(s).) Much of the film is about their relationship, and how a scam got Worm busted before the story begins and how the two have to fight to get out of a much larger predicament than governmental authorities.The world of the law students, which ends up playing second fiddle to the poker world, includes McDermott's girlfriend and one of the professors, played by Martin Landau. The glimpses of the more refined world of the law school acts as an excellent reflection on the seedier poker universe to better define McDermott and how he fits into both. But as the movie progresses, the poker world monopolizes larger and larger amounts of his time, energy and attention.Briefly, the film begins with a devastating poker heads-up hand between McDermott and none other than Teddy KGB, the most feared man of the movie, down in KGB's own ""poker casino"" that looks like an underground detention center. The story fast-forwards several months later as McDermott tries to reconcile himself vowing to quit poker forever, like an alcoholic vows to stop drinking, and devote all his energy to studying law. But when he picks up Worm from prison, McDermott ends up getting sucked back into the game. And the more he plays, the more his law studies and his girlfriend take a back seat. Simultaneously, a sub-plot is brewing in which we learn that Worm has many obligations awaiting him when he was released from custody, and simultaneously, he has not shaken his ""interesting"" ways of winning poker hands which starts becoming a very dangerous game. Eventually, Worm's situations, both past and present, McDermott's willingness to get back into poker intersect providing an incredible tale of twists and turns that will keep you wondering who's got the hand and who's bluffing.Rounders is a gem of movie. The acting is absolutely first rate all around, particularly from the supporting cast. The movie has elements of a suspense thriller with high intelligence and yet always reminds you that this is about poker players. Johnny Chan, the twice champion of the World Series of Poker, makes an unexpected cameo. And of course, the highest acclaim for Matt Damon and Edward Norton.

52,FilmOtaku,"A decent, if not one-dimensional film",6,7 September 2004,"'Rounders', directed by John Dahl and starring Matt Damon and Edward Norton, deals with two childhood friends who are poker players; Worm (Norton) has just gotten out of prison and is content with being a small-time hustler who has to dig himself out of the hole he got into with debtors before he went into prison. Mike McDermott (Damon) is his buddy who, after losing all of his money in one hand to KGB (John Malkovich) nine months prior, has decided to get out of the cards racket and concentrate on law school; more to please his girlfriend than anything. Of course, within ten minutes of picking Worm up from prison, he is back to playing cards, and his girlfriend promptly leaves him. In a bid to save both of their necks, Worm and Mike must earn 15K in five days, so they do what they know best, play poker.The biggest problem with 'Rounders' is that it tries to create a multi-faceted story where there really is nothing but poker playing as a plot. The audience is supposed to contemplate the bonds of friendship, the struggle in relationships, etc. but these plot lines are so weak in favor of the poker playing that the film would have been better off had these elements not been introduced at all. Instead, there are many plot holes and a couple of moments where I was left saying 'So what?' The poker scenes were indeed very interesting and well done; they probably should have been either expanded on or toned down a bit in favor of stronger and more clearly defined conflict lines in terms of the supporting story. Having said that, the acting in 'Rounders' was quite good  Matt Damon was, well he was 'Matt Damon' and Edward Norton, who is always good, was good as the degenerate hustler. The greatest acting, however unsurprising as it is at this point, was the small but effective role of KGB, played by Malkovich.He is virtually unrecognizable beneath baggy clothes and a big beard, and his accent, though I'm not an authority, was flawless. Malkovich is best in his small, quirky roles, and this was absolutely no exception. His acting was the high point of the film, despite the fact that he was on screen for perhaps fifteen minutes total. 'Rounders' is not a bad movie because of its flaws, but unfortunately its one-dimensionality makes it only a decent film. I liked its low-budget, art house feel, and I always have to respect an actor, no matter how big they are (though Damon and Norton weren't as prolific at this point) for being in an independent film.

The suspense and the essential jeopardy of Damon's character is well done, and the involved references ensure that poker nerds will have plenty to get their teeth into.But there are several things seriously wrong with the structure of 'Rounders'. ***(SPOILERS)*** First of all, why doesn't Matt Damon just take off to Vegas in the first place? I accept that he's trying to stay loyal to the girl, but betting his whole bankroll on a non-nut hand is not the action of someone who owns all those poker manuals in his apartment. At the end he has his money back, and all that's changed is that he's single again - this is a pretty mundane illustration of the idea that he has 'learned to let his destiny find him'. He seemed to shrug off his girl leaving pretty easily, compared to the agony which Martin Landau in a parallel backstory seemed to suffer in leaving his mother (oy!). I suppose he had Ed (and there was a gay shout-out in Atlantic City), which brings me to: Second of all, and the main flaw in the film: Ed Norton's marvellous character takes over the plot; as soon as we watch him playing on his own, the movie becomes his story - and then when he just suddenly fades away at the end it's a total letdown. Where did that fantastically flakey character go? It's like Dustin Hoffman disappearing halfway through Midnight Cowboy. In the first half he's THE pivotal character, in the second, we're just supposed to forget him. (This was also a flaw in The Hustler - the love interest kills herself? Oh well, let's play pool for big money). With the loss of focus on Matt's character the whole movie becomes confused, and the big poker finish only resolves the plot issues they have heaped on Matt Damon - he takes on Ed Norton's debt? He doesn't take on Ed Norton's debt to the audience, which would have involved Ed Norton redeeming himself in some way concerning the beating of KGB. I think the use of voice-over is an admission that Matt Damon's character doesn't convincingly carry all the film. It starts off a buddy movie, and the buddy butts out. Third of all, the female character is two-dimensional; I suppose something had to give in the struggle to fit all that poker in, but she just walks out. That's it. How convenient. One more scene for MD's decline and another for his redemption and that's all girls. She wasn't even what you'd call hot, unlike the girl in the club (he turned her down? Was that another gay shout-out?)All in all, the only thing that changes in Matt Damon's character is that he decides he's better off single. Not a world-shattering conclusion. And one more thing - to expect us to believe that nobody else had spotted KGB's cookie tell is little short of insulting the audience's intelligence, as well as that of the whole New York Russian poker scene. He might as well have had a special clown mask he put on when he was bluffing. I do think John Malkovich thought he was in a different movie, maybe something by Ken Russell - Goran Vsnic (bit part as one of the Russian suckers) would have been far more believable as a main heavy.Seven for the show, four for the structure.",Rounders
59,CANpatbuck3664,Rounders is a Well Written and Well Acted Character Piece That Packs a Punch,8,13 December 2016,"*Minor Spoilers Ahead* Mike McDermott (Matt Damon) is a law student that plays high stakes poker on the side. He's brilliant, well-versed and cocky as hell. He plays poker at an underground poker game run by Russian mobster KGB (John Malkovich). On the way to the game he talks about his style of play and what you need to do to succeed in this game. He works his way to the final table and he thinks he's got KGB beat until KGB flips his cards over with the best possible hand on the table. Mike loses his entire $30,000 bankroll. It's then he decides to change and promises his girlfriend Jo (Gretchen Mol) that he won't play poker anymore. He follows that promise and begins to succeed in school but with his former best-friend Worm (Edward Norton) getting out of jail, will he tempt Mike into his old habits?The first thing I want to talk about is the look of the film. The movie doesn't offer much in the way of flashy visuals but it captures the feel of tense poker games. The environment is sometimes dirty and there isn't enough light. People aren't terribly concerned with their appearance and there isn't always a friendly atmosphere. It's not glamorous playing in someone's basement (I'm not a pro poker player but I know my way around Texas Hold'Em) or in the back room of a bar. The grittiness of the cinematography and the tension captured in the poker playing scenes adds a feel out authenticity to the movie.I tend not to be a big fan of character pieces that centre around unsympathetic heroes. Who wants to watch some guy/girl you can't stand journey towards redemption? What this movie does so well is that while you can't always agree with Mike's decisions, he never completely crosses the line into being an unforgivable prick. He's genuinely trying to be a better person but through a combination of his own weakness and Worm constantly manipulating him, he can't turn away. I think Rounders presents a very well-written look at how hard it can be to escape your demons especially when those around you are trying to pull you down into the $#^!. This is driven-home by having Joey Knish (John Tuturro) in the movie. He does the honest work, pounds the pavement and has that control. He might not have hit it big but he gets by and I really liked the scene where he gives it right back to Mike when he essentially calls him a loser.This movie has other strengths other than the sharp dialogue and the strong characters you could relate to. If Matt Damon or Edward Norton had phoned it in, the movie would have collapsed on itself and luckily they came to play (much like their characters). Matt Damon plays it just right as Mike, he's the straight-man next to Norton but he's the perfect mix of cold and calculating without being a jerk. He helps make Mike seem believable in this scummy underworld. Edward Norton is just as good as Worm, he's that scumbag you love to hate. There are points where it's hard not to yell at the screen because he's just so frustrating. Norton's got a lot of charm but his character's unshakable belief that he's invincible made me furious. I also liked Martin Landau, John Tuturro, Gretchen Mol and Michael Rispoli in their respective supporting roles. I also like John Malkovich but this is the second movie I've seen where he can't quite nail his accent (Deepwater Horizon would be the other).Some people have complained about the ending to Rounders. I don't think it's perfect (KGB gets played pretty easily after taking Mike to school in the beginning) but I think it hits the right bittersweet balance. Mike isn't a hero, he plays KGB again when he should walk away and he leaves to go to Las Vegas in the closing minutes of the film. He also doesn't track down Worm either which I liked too. He gets out of the jam and is able to escape without ending up in a shallow grave. The movie doesn't feel the need to teach you a lesson, it trusts you to pick it up by yourself and while that can be frustrating sometimes, I thought it was kind of poignant here.I had only a few small complaints about this movie. One, Rounders can be pretty depressing. The story is predictable at points and once Mike goes down the rabbit hole, until you hit the end, you know what he's going to find isn't pretty. There are minor problems with the poker games (I mentioned above, the ending of the final game seems a little anti-climactic) but it remained pretty tense. I see why this movie was a cult-hit. It tells an interesting and contained story, it has two of the better actors of their generation putting on a clinic and while it isn't perfect it's easily one of the best films centred around this game.",Rounders
60,LebowskiT1000,Who would have thought a film about Poker would be so good?,8,16 October 2002,"There is a lot of good stuff in this film.  You have a great story, an excellent cast, excellent directing, and a couple great games of poker.When I first heard about this film, I was a bit skeptical.  It's a game about poker, how exciting can it be?  The fact that Edward Norton was in the film was the prime reason I wanted to see ""Rounders"".  After seeing the film, I couldn't believe how much I liked it.  The film flows very well from start to finish and you can't wait to see what happens in the next scene. Also, the film is filled with interesting, well-written characters.As I mentioned above, the cast is fantastic.  You have Matt Damon, Edward Norton, John Malkovich, John Turturro, Gretchen Mol, Famke Janssen, Martin Landau and some small roles by Melina Kanakaredes (of ""Providence"") and Goran Visnjic (of ""ER"").  Matt Damon is quite a good actor and this is just another great film to add to his list of already impressive roles.  Edward Norton is fantastic as ""Worm"", he plays a truly unlikeable person, but at the same time you respect him for taking the fall for his friends.  John Tuturro is excellent, as always, he has such a cool style about him.  John Malkovich is superb in his portrayal of Teddy KGB.  And the rest of the cast does a great job as well in their respective roles.If you are a poker fan, then I recommend you see this film, hopefully you'll enjoy it.  I myself am not a huge fan of poker, but I do play the occasional game and I loved this film.  I loved the characters, the dialogue, the acting, EVERYTHING.  I truly hope you enjoy the film.  Thanks for reading,-Chris",Rounders
61,OriginalMovieBuff21,A great movie with a terrific cast,9,22 August 2006,"Rounders is about a reformed gambler that must return to playing big stakes poker to help a friend pay off loan sharks. This is a really entertaining film that is almost comparable to Ocean's Eleven. The cast was incredible. Edward Norton, Martin Landau, John Malkovich, and especially the main lead, Matt Damon did there roles very well and without their great performances, the film would be a let down. The direction by John Dahl and the screenplay written by former writers, David Levien and Brian Koppelman, were very well done also. The dialogue was written well and the narration by Matt Damon, made the film even better. Overall, this is a very gripping and entertaining movie. I highly recommend it.Hedeen's Outlook: 8.5/10 ***+ B+",Rounders
62,caa821,Still outstanding - with added dimension now,10,14 October 2006,"Watching this movie again, now, it is somewhat different from viewing it eight years ago. With the many television programs featuring professional poker players, and amateurs who have won or bought entry into the tournaments, there are millions more people interested in, and familiar with, this game than in 1998.The Travel Channel originated the ""World Poker Tour,"" and even has now added a spin-off. ESPN and FOX, as well as others, have their own tourneys. You not only can play poker on-line - for about any stakes you'd like - but have umpteen sites from which to select.Johnny Chan and Eric Seidel were the two professionals shown in the movie, and they are still among the best. Phil Helmuth and Doyle Brunson (the ""Babe Ruth"" of Texas Hold'em) were mentioned in the dialog; both are also prominent, and the latter the paterfamilias to all. I enjoy watching the television presentations, but not nearly as much as a lot of my friends, and even I can now name about thirty of the prominent players by name without drawing a breath or pondering.In the days of the movie, and preceding, the singular ""World Series of Poker"" was held in Vegas annually, at Binion's, and paid $1-million to the winner. Now the television shows present something weekly, in exotic locales throughout the U. S., in France the Bahamas, the Caribbean, and on luxury liners - often with top prizes well over $1-million. Sometimes even the 2nd place finisher receives more than a million, and those finishing lower get several hundred thousand.Nonetheless, this film is just as entertaining, and has an additional point of interest it didn't possess when released. In just eight years, it has become sort of a ""classic,"" a depiction of an earlier period (""the old days""), of its subject matter - something that usually takes a play, book or film, say, 30 or 40 years to do.Damon, Norton, Malcovich, Tuturro, Landau - and all the rest of the cast - are outstanding and engaging in their roles.There is one final aspect which those more interested and experienced in serious poker (even if well-below the $1,000,000 level) can appreciate, too. Even in Malcovich's shabby gambling loft, filled with seedy characters, mob muscle guys, loan sharks, etc. - there still is a sense of honor in paying debts (even if their criteria might vary from, say, you neighborhood banker), and you could leave your chips to visit the restroom or take a break, and return to find them intact. By contrast, most of the ""neighborhood bankers,"" and even a large percentage of your average citizens, in the same situation, would likely help themselves to a few of your chips, ""by accident,"" if they felt you wouldn't discover. {In the story, even John Malcovich's character, ""KGB,"" the proprietor of the ""non-licensed"" poker room, and a Russian gangster, admits in the finale that Matt has ""...beat me straight up; pay him (he pronounces it 'heeem'); pay that man his ('heees') money ('mooohney'). Although he doesn't do it graciously, even this wholly-unsympathetic individual is honorable in this context.}In addition to the main characters and supporting cast, the others encountered in the many gambling venues visited are also thoroughly interesting, realistic and fascinating.",Rounders
63,Beejerman,CHEER! - (9 stars out of 10),9,18 March 2021,"The stage curtains open ...""Rounders"" features Matt Damon as Mike McDermott, a card player who knows all the angles, in what I consider to be one of his best roles to date. Having always had a fascination with the World Series of Poker myself, this movie was an immediate draw for me. Upon my first viewing of the film, I was completely absorbed into the story and the characters ... and every subsequent viewing since.Mike, a struggling law student, has dreams of one day playing in the World Series of Poker. Not only appearing in it, but winning it all. He has video tapes of the event, and he's studied the game of poker until he knows everything there is to know about it. He's learned how to read the players, look for their ""tells"", when to raise, and when to fold. But when he loses everything he has, he makes promises to his live-in girlfriend that he can't keep. Especially when his friend, Worm (played by Edward Norton Jr.), is released from prison and forces him back into the game. Now he has to take the greatest gamble of his life.This is such a well orchestrated film. Nobody could've played this part better than Matt Damon. He nailed it, and Edward Norton Jr., as a magnet for trouble, was also excellent. All supporting roles were played perfectly and believably, most notably by John Malkovich as Teddy ""KGB"", a Russian mobster who runs his own game house. The pacing is spot on with no lulls. The story and characters are all fleshed out nicely, and the final resolution was beyond expectation.I love this movie, and still watch it from time to time today. I give it a very strong 9 stars out of 10 with a high recommend. This is nearly a perfect film with very little, if any, flaws associated to it. Matt Damon has gone on to bigger and better things, but I still hold this performance as one of my personal favorites.",Rounders
64,christophe92300,For poker players,6,6 November 2012,"Rounders is fully appreciated if being a poker player or at least knowing a few things about the game. If you don't, you find yourself kind of frustrated because the script and the tension that results from it relies for a good part on the technical aspect of poker. Still the story manages to be dynamic, pretty well told, though a bit stereotyped on some points.The characters are a bit caricatural, but the cast did great and there was a good alchemy between Damon and Norton.The direction was quite good, with a special attention brought to the photography.",Rounders
65,SKG-2,Very good for poker fans,9,7 February 1999,"I can't claim to be a poker expert, but I do play on occasion and know things, so I am part of the ideal audience for this movie.  Unlike some, I didn't have any problems following the jargon-heavy screenplay (though it might have been a little too heavy), even if I didn't recognize a couple of the games they played.  Dahl managed to make it look interesting and cinematic, and the dark, gritty look he gave to the rest of the film helped. Gretchen Mol is wasted in the girlfriend part, but the rest of the cast is very good.  Unlike some, I thought Matt Damon was quite good in the lead, and Norton was a hoot as his best friend, as was Malkovich as KGB.  I do wonder how many good card players rely on ""tells,"" but that didn't stop me from enjoying this quite a bit (though I'm not what a non-poker fan will think).",Rounders
66,AKS-6,A good film,6,13 October 1999,"Okay, to be honest my reason for renting this film was Edward Norton. He's such a fantastic actor, so very talented, that I really don't care what films he's in. I must stress, though, that I would *never* like a film only because Norton's in it, it's just that he's so brilliant that he would make it worth it to sit through a boring film. The thing is that Norton has never been in a bad film, which means (in other words) that I liked ""Rounders"". I really didn't expect much from this film, but as it turned out I was very interested to know how Mike (Matt Damon) and Worm (Norton) would get out of their Shall we call it ""predicament""? :-) I even liked the lenghty poker game scenes. Matt Damon did a good job, as did most of the other actors even if Malkovich's turn as Teddy KGB was a bit over the top. Norton was of course as brilliant as ever. [Possible spoiler follows.] I must say that I really missed Worm when he decided to leave NY, there was something very sad about his character and I really wanted to know how things turned out for him.Overall, a good film. Not as good as I had wanted it to be, but it was still very interesting.",Rounders
67,chrisbrown6453,"I guess I enjoyed Rounders. But I also guess if you don't like playing poker (or cards in general), you probably wouldn't enjoy Rounders. It was a well acted movie, but had a plot that reminded me of a Rocky",7,17 June 2002,"Matt Damon plays Mike McDermott, a card shark (or a rounder, get it?). He used to play cards for serious money, but as we see in the first few minutes of the film, he blows a lot of money on one hand, and decides to give up poker for a while. Here's one problem I had. He's in law school, and said he used the poker money to pay for his tuition, and I'm assuming his nice New York apartment with his girlfriend. Once he stops playing cards, and drives a truck around all night, how in the hell does he still pay tuition? I don't think you make enough money driving a delivery truck around, to pay for tuition and an apartment. When Mike's best friend from his younger days (Worm, played by Edward Norton) gets out of prison, Mike goes to pick him up. Worm immediately wants to get into a game of poker, and to bring Mike along with him. Mike says no, but we all know whats going to happen. Mike jumps back into the game, loses his girlfriend, gets beat up, owes money to the Russian Mob, uses a lot of technical card playing terms, and comes out clean in the end. Like in Rocky III where Rocky gets his ass kicked by Mr. T early in the movie, then fights his way back to win in the end.  Wait, doesn't that happen in all the Rocky movies? The movie is predictable, no question about that. So what you need are strong, likeable characters to help push you through that. So let's run down the major characters in the film.Matt Damon's Mike McDermott - I liked him. Damon has a regular guy charm about him that makes him stand out from the rest. So I liked his character.
Edward Norton's Worm - Didn't like him at all. But I think I wasn't supposed to, so that's good. All Worm did was try and destroy both himself and Mike. I think it was because he felt the only way he could get Mike's attention, was by bringing Mike down with him. But his abrupt departure near the end of the film left me hanging. Mike's girlfriend Jo (Grechen Mol) - Didn't like her at all. First of all, why is there all this hubub about her being the next big girl? She was only in the movie for a few minutes, and her character annoyed the hell out of me. All she did was whine and question every move Mike made. I think if they had added a little more to Mike and Jo's background story, this would have made more sense, but as it stands, she came off as being whiny and annoying.
Mike's law school professor Abe Peterovsky (Martin Landau) - He was supposed to be the moral center of this movie. Yet his major thing was basically to tell Mike that he should leave law school and play cards. What kind of professor would say that? And what he does near the end of the movie is almost unbelievable. Like the actor, didn't like the role.
Lastly I'll do John Malkovich as Teddy KGB - KGB is the owner of a major illegal underground poker house. He also happens to have ties to the Russian Mob. Malkovich plays him with this over the top accent, but makes him a great character at the same time. He was there as the bad guy to Mike's good guy, and pulled it off amazingly. So I liked this character.
There were others to be sure, John Tuturro and Famke Janssen among others, in the film that sort of helped the (plot?) along. Overall though, I found I didn't like or understand a lot of the characters. What made this movie were Matt Damon and John Malkovich. Thankfully, the movie centered on Damon, and his ""enemy"" in the film was Malkovich, which made the movie entertaining and something worth seeing. You probably need to be a Matt Damon fan to really enjoy Rounders. But at the same time, if you've never seen a Matt Damon film (and why haven't you seen Good Will Hunting yet?) this is a good one to see as well. Damon does have the ability to be the next big thing, if he isn't already.",Rounders
68,buccaneer21,The Viewer Would Look Forward To Rounders 2,10,23 August 2017,"Well,IMDb states that Rounders 2 is on development.Matt Damon have already stated numerous times that Rounders 2 is going to happen.He already said in an interview that he has talked to the writers about it and that the popularity of poker will definitely increase interest in it unlike when the prequel - Rounders - was released back in 1998.What was Rounders all about?Rounder is a 1998 film about a Law student named Mike McDermott who also happens to be a poker prodigy. It stars Damon and Edward Norton together with talented cast that includes John Turturro,Gretchen Mol,John Malkovich and the late Martin Landau.The film begins when Mike McDermott decides to change his gambling habits and decided to play in high stakes poker in the underworld casino that is connected to the Russian mob named Teddy KGB.He decided to gamble all his winnings - $30,000 - but unfortunately lost everything to the owner.This made him stop gambling and focus in finishing his Law degree and his relationship with his girlfriend Jo,who happens to be a fellow Law student.Then things change when his friend Lester ""Worm"" Murphy,played magnificently by Edward Norton, was released from prison.Their activities brought Mike back into poker and he definitely started to get his back life into it.With more time playing cards considering that Mike has vouched for Worm's gambling debt from loan sharks,Mike's passion for playing poker was definitely reignited to the point that he could no longer escape it. Then it came to a point that Jo broke up with him and he was no longer interested in pursuing Law School as he wanted to play in Vegas particularly the WSOP (World Series of Poker) at the conclusion of the film.No wonder that it definitely was a great film.I am aware that the story is definitely incomparable to other great films like ""The Godfather"" as its film was more about Mike and Worm's activities on card tables playing poker and how Mike regained his winnings from Teddy KGB which just gave the viewers a simple story.But what made it great are many other things.No question that the performances on the cast was great.Damon and Norton have given life to their characters as Mike and Worm respectively.They kept the movie going from the time they met until the time they were punched by the state troopers.The rest of the cast were also good enough like John Malkovich,who was a scene stealer as Teddy KGB,despite his awkward Russian accent; and the late Martin Landau,who played the Law Dean that pursued Mike not to escape from his identity.Another reason is poker.No question that the film revolved around poker particularly with Mike's experience in the card table from beginning to end.The viewer gets to learn more about the game as well as the familiar terms that are involved in it.It also tried to move poker away from gambling in a sense that it is a definitely a game of skills and not a game of luck.This was obviously was the central argument between Mike and Jo which ended their relationship.Aside from that,it was also presented that Mike's experience with Teddy KGB at the beginning when he lost and the end when he regained his winnings back.Finally,it also presented that poker is indeed worthy of one's time as it was presented in Mike and Worm's characters and their activities.No question that it never earned a lot of money - $22 million - when it was released back in 1998.Aside from the fact that both Matt Damon and Edward Norton aren't yet established actors when it was released,poker hasn't yet became popular unlike today with the many online poker sites existing in the internet.But when poker became popular,it became a cult poker film. I expect interest to be renewed in it after almost 20 years when it was released when Rounder 2 is about to be released in the theaters.",Rounders
69,maria2023,A Pro-Poker Film,10,22 August 2017,"Rounders 2 is actually on development.When Matt Damon was interviewed,he stated that he has already committed to the project and so has Edward Norton.He also said that he has already talked to the writers about it.This new movie serves as a sequel to the 1998 movie known as Rounders.The 1998 film stars Damon and Norton together with John Turturro,Gretchen Mol,John Malkovich and the late Martin Landau.It tells the story of Michael McDermott,a poker prodigy who intends to complete in Las Vegas,got himself cleaned out in the underworld casino by the owner Teddy KGB.After losing all his winnings,he decided to become a full-time Law student and a truck worker.He also never played poker for 9 months.But things began to change when his friend Lester ""Worm"" Murphy got released from prison.They started playing cards and this reignited his passion for poker.Then he found himself playing more after Worm got into more gambling debts from loan sharks.In the process,he became a full-time poker player until he got another poker match with Teddy KGB.This time,he was able to beat him.This led him to pursue his dreams in Vegas and left being a Law student.No question that storywise,this movie cannot never be considered a masterpiece despite giving it a perfect 10/10 rating.It is just a typical underdog sports film.What made it deserve that rating are many other reasons.First,we have great performances from Damon and Norton as well as the rest of the cast particularly Malkovich, Landau,Turturro and Mol.They gave life to their characters.Second,we get to see more of a sports film rather than a gambling film as the movie tried to make poker more a skills game and not a form of game of gambling.They made the characters support it from Landau's Abe Petrovsky,who encouraged Mike McDermott to pursue becoming a poker player.Anyone who isn't is somehow painted as a bitch particularly Mike's girlfriend Jo,who left him abruptly after she discovered as she once again is playing cards.Third,the writers definitely made Mike extremely passionate towards poker.Passionate in the sense that Mike was able to overcome negative situations in life - losing his winnings,getting dump by his girlfriend,failing in his Law class particularly his mock trial,getting used and manipulated by his sycophant friend Worm,being unable to sleep for 2-3 days, and many others - as long as he is playing poker.The movie really painted that there is joy in playing cards.It was definitely a pro-Cards or pro-Poker movie. No question that even professional poker players competing in the WSOP (World Series of Poker) have made this film a reference as far as what led them to becoming poker players.After saying these things,it would be safe to conclude that a person would be motivated to play poker after watching this film.After watching it once again after many years,I definitely look forward to the sequel - Rounders 2 - now that they probably would have the setting -as Damon stated - at the WSOP in Vegas.",Rounders

I didn't really get the whole poker thing at the time,and as I now am a big fan of Texas Hold 'Em, thought I should re-watch it.The movie begins with us meeting Mike (Damon), a young, cocky poker player. He thinks he's in for the win of his life until Teddy KGB (Malkovich) beats him heads up and takes the whole pot. Devastated and emotionally destroyed, he decides to quit and put his focus into his law studies. Things get shaken up though when Mike's best friend and poker buddy, Worm (Norton), gets released from prison. Worm is a card shark and uses every trick in the book and looks for every sucker he can to win. As soon as he's released from prison Worm has a game set up. He begs Mike to come play with him but Mike refuses (or does he?). When Worm gets some old debts called in and is back up to his old tricks, Mike has decide whether to get back to help him out or to break the friendship before he gets dragged back in.The poker in the game is good, but the movie is about far more than that. It brings up lots of questions- how many times do we forgive those around us, how far should you go to help a friend, redemption, generosity.... a lot more than you'd expect from a poker movie.Easily re-watchable and there's something in it for everyone, even non-poker fans.

72,B24,Engaging,7,14 May 2006,"Here is a showcase for the talents of Matt Damon and the recently rediscovered Edward Norton. Veteran actors like Martin Landau and John Turturro also fare well, and the peripatetic Mr. Malkovich reprises his role as inheritor of the Meryl Streep trophy for slightly off-center accents. In its current 2006 rebirth on DVD and cable, the film ages very well indeed. Poker is still in vogue. Norton's career is in full fury for Down In The Valley. Matt Damon continues to impress audiences as far more believable than Tom Cruise in the genre of various and sundry missions impossible and spy thrillers.The story is more about a young man's coming of age after a false start, however, than it is about poker. The center of the film is the interaction between Damon's and Landau's characters. It is also a tale of a man's competing loyalties to a best buddy, a girlfriend, a worthy profession, and himself. In that it is straightforward and accessible to any viewer, whether or not the viewer has any acquaintance with an obsessive behavior like compulsive gambling.This is moreover a beautifully photographed and directed film. If I have any gripe with it at all it is that the script does sort of telegraph what is about to happen from time to time, leaving the viewer in the position of wondering not what will follow, but how it will be played out. Still, an engaging experience.",Rounders
73,shanfloyd,Incredible performances...,7,3 August 2006,"I regret the fact that I have too little knowledge about the game of poker to even comment on the factual superiority of this film, but to quote my friends who do, it is 'safely accurate and interesting'. What attracted me in this film is the stellar cast and yes, they didn't disappoint me. Matt Damon is professionally perfect as the poker genius protagonist. His commentary throughout the film is also praiseworthy. John Malkovich is also a special treat to watch.But the real star of the film is Edward Norton. He portrays a brilliantly written character with enormous style. Every scene he's in becomes a slick style-fest. His persona makes it so interesting to watch a scumbag character. It's a regret that he doesn't appear at the end of the film.",Rounders

I found parts of this boring-- watching people playing cards isn't all that exciting.... and Matt Damon is more a pretty boy than a great actor... but Martin Landau and John Malkovich and Norton make this movie watchable... sorry he didn't quit gambling while he was ahead-- but I guess his destiny found him....,Rounders
75,ryan_kuhn,"""If you don't have my money then you are mine.""",8,13 June 2005,"Rounders is a movie that proceeded the poker craze that has swept this nation. When it came out in 1998, it was a mild success, but now has a cult following as college kids and others discover they like to play poker after seeing it on TV for the past couple of years. Matt Damon plays Mike McDermott, a law school student who finds he's a wizard when it comes to playing poker. He's good, but lost one big hand to Teddy KGB (John Malkovich) and lost it all, leading to his retirement from the game. His girlfriend Jo (Gretchen Mol) is the one who convinces him to stay away from the poker tables, and is the one who loses faith in Mike when he starts to play again. Mike's retirement only lasts as long as his friend Worm, played wonderfully by Ed Norton, stays in jail. Upon Worm's exit from jail, debts need to be paid. Ed Norton is able to make his character so unlikeable that we feel bad for him and the others who are risking it all to help Worm out. Damon does a solid job of being the good poker player who thinks he can beat the house every time he walks up to a table. Martin Landau also makes an appearance as Mike's college mentor, channeling a thick Yiddish accent that lead me to recall his work as Bela Legosi in Ed Wood. Landau's job in Rounders is to be the Yoda to Mike's Luke Skywalker, dispensing sage advice about destiny and helping Mike save his life. The movie ends in a way that elevate poker from a mathematical numbers game to a psychological battle, the way the game is meant to be played. The poker craze has been mostly online, where playing the percentages is the way people win. When sitting down at a table, on the other hand, not only are the numbers important, but mental combat can lead to winning and losing, and Rounders was able to show this brilliantly. The non-serious poker fan will enjoy the movie as a good guys vs. the bad guys story. The serious poker fan, on the other hand, will really like this movie, as the game is shown for what it is, but also shows the risks of stepping up to the big boys' tables and there are cameos by some of poker's greatest players. And, thankfully, no Ben Affleck in this movie either.",Rounders
76,ryangilmer007,"Get to know the rounded, well played physic of a gambler/KGB- Texas Hold em",9,9 February 2001,"Rounders is the story of a guy who is a great gambler and who could make a living on gambling by beating the casino and other players along the way. However, as luck would have it, he is forced into high stakes, he is forced to go back into the world that he tried to leave.This is were the movie takes off. Rounders (1998) used the technical kowledge of real ""rounders""/pro-gamblers to pull off its sense of realism. However, it does this while balancing the ""law"" aspect of the story and while introducing us to great characters like John Malkovich and his ""Teddy KGB"". You don't have to be a gambler to enjoy this film.In fact, I dont gamble much, but if you want to see how gambling can come down to the finest perceived detail or the ""edge"" of control, Rounders it for you, it will help you get into the mind-set and the physic of the game.Viewed on tape.

Don't get me wrong, it is a good movie, but nothing more than that, all i could give it was a rating of 5.Rounders is the story of a gambler named Mike. After losing all his money playing cards, he decides never to gamble again. 9 months later, his long time friend Worm is released from jail and he convinces Mike to  reenter in the ""business"".The story is slow in many times and not convincing at all.

78,Barky44,"Poker was interesting, characters were not",6,17 September 2005,"So many wanna-be poker stars love talking about Rounders. Everyone likes to throw out quotes and proclaim how this film really shows what it's like.Well, maybe it does. Maybe Rounders is truly about the seedy underbelly of the professional poker circuit.The problem is, as a film Rounders doesn't really hold up that well.Rounders lacks any sort of an emotional core. It's as bland as a well-rehearsed poker face. It's hard to care about the characters, it's hard to empathize with any of the hard choices portrayed in the film, it's hard to connect with these people on any sort of a level. The bad guys aren't interesting enough to be despised; the good guys aren't interesting enough to root for; and the rest are just window dressing.Matt Damon shows intensity during the poker scenes, but otherwise falls flat. He fails to imbue this ""good guy"" character with any sort of heart or soul. He does not adequately ""sell"" the scenes where his girlfriend dumps him, when his mentor bails him out of trouble, when his old friend screws him over. I think Damon tried so hard to portray single-minded focus of a poker master he let the rest of the character facets fall by the wayside.Edward Norton, an actor whose work I normally admire, is only moderately more interesting here than Damon. But he's been in so many better films, this is not at all indicative of his abilities. After watching 25th Hour, Fight Club, and even The Italian Job (a film he even admits to having ""phoned in""), any Norton fans should be let down by Rounders.I've given this film a 6 out of 10. It does have an interesting, if unrealized, script. Some of the poker scenes, especially the bits about scamming, are interesting. And I've seen much worse.But overall Rounders simply isn't that well acted, and that's it's downfall.Barky",Rounders
79,Pavel-8,A very compelling film.,8,16 July 2003,"**Warning! Mild Spoilers Ahead!**""Rounders"" tells the story of Mike McDermott (Matt Damon), who was once a pretty good card shark, and his best friend Worm (Edward Norton), an accomplice fresh out of jail. As one can infer, Worm nudges Mike back into the card world, and things snowball from there.The movie falls primarily into the sports movie genre. Poker of course isn't a conventional sport, but the script follows the sports movie formula. Thus, you shouldn't be shocked by any of the plot turns, as the movie requirements make each decision a necessary one. But what does surprise is the smartness of the decisions. The characters think smartly and on their feet, making almost every decision a logical one, when the character of each is considered. Everything adds up well, leading to the blood-pumping final scenes (at least as much as poker can get the blood-pumping).
Acting performances provide both highlights and lowlights of ""Rounders."" Matt Damon provides Mike with the needed mix of boyishness and confidence, and contributes one of the great movie faces of the last few years when he loses a poker hand early in the movie. Edward Norton nails another part, this one as the slimy weasel of a friend. Worm rarely makes a good decision, and Norton expresses that cocky stupidity, effectively making you want to strangle him.I haven't yet decided if Gretchen Mol is awful in her role as Mike's girlfriend, Jo, or if she nails the part so well that I hate her. The truth is probably somewhere in between, and regardless of her intent, she portrays the epitome of every whiny, intrusive girlfriend. With Jo's every line, you can almost hear the stakes being hammered into Mike's heart. If you watch this with a group of guys (as you should), you will undoubtedly hear a combination of cursing, moaning, muttering, and teeth-gnashing as she grates on their nerves. But at least from a male perspective, this doesn't detract from the movie. Mike becomes that much more appealing, as we beg for him to ditch the b**** and dive back into the exhilarating world of high-stakes poker.John Malkovich's portrayal of Russian mobster Teddy KGB also deserves its own paragraph. He delivers one of the most enjoyable over-the-top performances I can remember. I have no idea what the heck kind of an accent he uses, don't know if it's accurate at all, and frankly don't care. It somehow hits the right note. Teddy's flawed attempts to use American profanity and innuendo are perfectly executed, yet hilarious.
Among the solid supporting cast is John Tuturro, being his usual stellar self as Knish, the stoic grinder. Martin Landau, in a Obi-Wan/Mickey Goldmill-esque role, is fine to good as Mike's law professor. Famke Janssen is smokin' as Petra, the Russian vixen who runs a local poker club. The rest of the cast falls into place, nailing their parts without drawing much attention to themselves.Matt Damon provides narration over the course of the movie, and that is an excellent decision by the filmmakers. Rather than provide excessive exposition in the form of dialogue, they choose to use Damon's voice, which provided thoughts primarily related to poker theory. Those opinions and facts are both informative and enticing, further drawing the viewer into the poker world. That world is portrayed extremely well, and yet you need not know anything about cards to enjoy this movie. While you probably won't pick up on some of the intricacies, you will still fully understand what is happening.This is the kind of movie that doesn't rely on technical prowess to succeed. But those aspects of the flick are still surprisingly good. There isn't a traditional score, but the music kicks in at appropriate times. Often used along with shots of transition, both physical and emotional, the soundtrack contains a mixture of jazz and blues instrumental music. It's card-playing music, Vegas music, driving when necessary, sitting in the background when necessary. The highlight of the understated music was at the end of the movie. After a climactic event, the camera lingers on a particular person who is absorbing what happened. Rather than crescendo and over-dramatize the moment, the music remains subdued, effectively expressing the thoughts of that character.The color choices are excellent as well. The exterior shots and most non-poker scenes are primarily done in monochromatic hues, somewhat similar to the matrix portion of the ""Matrix"" films. Contrasting with those shots are the vivid colors of the poker scenes. Whether they occur in an Atlantic City casino or an underground lair, the card scenes feature a richness that is accented by the colorful chips and playing cards. Those scenes are where Mike says he feels alive, and the colors on the screen express this emotion as well.Great movies possess great themes, and although I hesitate to label this movie 'great', it does feature the great human themes of money, greed, pride, and friendship. These are what drive the show. Above all, it is a compelling film, one that you want to keep watching throughout, and one that you will likely want to watch again when finished.  After a few hands of poker.Bottom Line:  If this doesn't get you fired up to play poker, nothing will. 8 of 10. Let's play some cards.",Rounders

82,hbs,excellent movie,8,29 December 2001,"I have no idea if this movie is at all realistic (certainly so many people inhabiting this strata of the poker world can be so good looking), but at least it has the ring of verisimilitude. Not only does it show us the workings of a somewhat exotic (to me, anyway) part of the world, but it manages to do this stylishly while treating us to an interesting character study and a clever plot.The story is about a young ""rounder"" who is trying to go straight by going to law school (although our first glimpse of him shows him losing all his money in a high-stakes poker game with a Russian gangster). He quits gambling for a while until a old friend (played by Norton) returns to his life and lands him in deep trouble. What I especially like about the movie is that is starts off as if this plot line is the main subject, when in fact the movie is about this person learning important things about himself. And there is a lot of information about poker...Damon is especially impressive among a uniformly good cast.",Rounders
83,Don-102,Entertaining look at seedy NYC gambling...,7,17 March 1999,"Here is a movie with a lot of stars, both established and on the rise, that creates a fully believable world of lowly card-sharks, ex-cons, and a straight kid who is in the eye of the storm.  Matt Damon is the young man and lead of a cast of actors, who are hidden behind the facade of their characters.  This film easily could've been one of those all-star outings where we identify more with an actor's image than with what we are supposed to experience through the story.  John Dahl, director of 1993's RED ROCK WEST,  keeps the movie focused and does not allow it to stray into a morality play between Damon and his girlfriend (Gretchen Mol).  My worst fears did not come true when the girlfriend was placed in the background and the real story involving the friendship between Damon and Norton was told.Edward Norton is one of the best young actors of his generation.  His character is aptly titled 'worm'.  Damon proves again that he can play the lead effectively amongst a crowd of monster talent.  Martin Landau plays the quiet, vulnerable professor, John Turturro the constant on-looker of the poker underbelly, but the most interesting performance comes from John Malkovich, playing a Russian card player who acts and speaks strangely, but happens to run the Russian mob.  The key scenes do involve Norton and Damon. You never wonder why Damon keeps helping his paroled buddy.  They seem as if they have been through tough times together.ROUNDERS is also told in a Docu-drama style, showing us the way the games are played and the consequences you may face if you screw up.  The cinematography is sharp and the movie as a whole is an enjoyable romp through this dangerous lifestyle that always seems to clean people out. Gambling is all these people know, thus they continue to make the ""rounds"".",Rounders
84,Ladiloque,Poker is life?,9,31 May 2013,You won't probably get everything if you didn't ever play some hands at Texas Hold'em. But the film is so low profile and at the same time so powerful you will probably like it as for one typical Oscar worthy drama blockbuster. It's fault is it's centered on poker and there are more people disliking it than not. Every scene delivers and the 1st person story teller recounts events as if gifted with a superior perception (that of a successful poker player obviously). The film runs smoothly and the more you experienced borderline events the more you will find it an understanding companion recounting some typical wanderings of your life. The 9 is due to the writing overall (the script is a 10): actors do their job.,Rounders
85,mattrochman,More sobering than most realise,9,28 June 2006,"I would like to review this film, but I'm not going to. Instead, I'm going to use this space to address a different aspect of the film: the sobering aspect.Many people speak of Rounders as if it was really ""cool"" film with lots of poker and action and no limit and...etc.. etc.. But if you stand back and look at the plot, you'll realise that the film does not really endorse playing poker for a living, despite it's seductive representation of the game itself.Think about it for a minute. At the start of the film, he has $30,000 in cash spread around the house, a potential career in law, a fantastic apartment and a girl friend that was.... well.... SHAR-WING! Then he goes broke in a very unlucky situation (I think most world-class professionals would have similarly lost their entire stack in that hand). But his world doesn't entirely crumble around him... until his old poker playing buddy gets released from prison. By one hour and forty minutes into the film, he's broke, his girlfriend has left him, he's been badly beaten, he owes a KGB fellow $15,000 tomorrow, he also owes the Chesterfield $6,000 (Famke Jensen's underground club) and his law career is virtually over before it began. Poker basically turned his life upside down. Now think about that for a minute - all you young aspiring Michael McDermotts!!! In the end, he may well get the money together, but that's about it! His girlfriend gone, wicked NY apartment gone, law career gone, best friend gone and he skips off to Vegas to ""take a shot at it!"" Personally, I find that rather sobering, don't you? It's hardly inspiration to become a professional poker player!Further, I felt that Worm was probably the best developed character and very typical of people you come across in the poker community: ex-cons who have 'done time' and continue to lead scamming lives, leaving nothing more than a trail of unpaid debts to lenders and friends in their wake. It was most appropriate that worm went broke trying to beat a crooked blackjack game. Welcome to the sorts of characters you'll come across in the real-world poker community.It's for these reasons that I really appreciated the film all the more. Scenes where they are actually poker paints the game in a very seductive way, using funky mid-tempo jazz with snappy narration and smart editing. But away from the table, there is a certain melancholy surrounding the lives of these players and it's something you just can't get past.Excellent film - even for those with no poker knowledge. For those who think this is an inspiration to walk away from your life and become a professional, good luck.... But I guess it's not about luck, is it!",Rounders
86,themarina1,Norton as a bad influence???,7,27 April 2004,"I liked this predictable flick of a boy gone good and then bad again. This easily forgotten movie isn't so bad though. Damon manages a mediocre performance while Norton once more steals the show as recently jail released bad influence who drags Damon back into the high stakes game of poker. Really great game playing sequences with some not too shabby action bits thrown in, this isn't the best I've seen but most certainly not the worse either. To boot, Malkovich plays the hard *ss Russian who wants his money back.

87,RMurray847,Middle of the road muddle,5,1 June 2001,"Okay, let's get a couple of things straight first:  Ed Norton is a great actor.  He's impossible not to watch when on screen whether here with Matt Damon, or elsewhere with types such as Brad Pitt, or Richard Gere or anywhere.  On the other hand, Matt Damon, is little more than a big smile. Gretchen Mol is a non-entity.  John Malkovich...?!?!  (What has happened to this guy...can't anyone direct him anymore?...okay, okay, he was good as himself in BEING JOHN MALKOVICH.)  And Martin Landau has turned out to be quite a treasure in his old age.  He huge features exude so much life experience, world-weariness but opened heartedness.  The scene where he gives Damon the $10,000 is one of the best in the film.The film...there's the rub. On one hand, it feels like it wants to be a gritty, grimy expose of the toll gambling takes, the price of friendship, the toll of clawing your way from a miserable childhood into a decent adulthood, whatever.  Heck, the opening scenes almost feel like they could be set in the depression, all brown-tones and sweaty walls, with an old-fashioned voice over from Damon.On the other hand, the film is just a cliche film, following the rules of any ""sports"" film about underdogs winning against all odds.  Norton's character ends up being written in one dimension.  He smiles, acts goofy but charming, gets some money, cheats at poker, gets caught (maybe beat up), loses money, is told by all around him that he won't get anymore money, but gets it anyway.  Why in the hell does Damon stick with this guy?  Again, and again, and again?  He causes him to drop his vow to stay away from Poker, causes him to lose his girl and causes him to get the poop beat out of him and to end up owing a lot of bad people a lot of money.  It was never convincing.Gretchen Mols character is unconvincing as well.  It's tough to tell what she will or won't forgive in Damon.  And all the stuff about law school is completely unbelievable.The poker scenes seem to imply that any really good player will always have a good hand.  They always seem to be battling full houses against four of a kind.  In reality, aren't most poker hands lousy?  A pair of eights against a pair of fours, maybe?The scenes where all the pro players get together and chat, or play poker in Atlantic City, are kinda fun.  But in general, this movie seems to want to be a crowd-pleasing sports movie and a gritty slice-of-life movie.  In the end, it isn't quite either.Matt Damon belongs in no more movies.  He has no gravitas, and now his smile is getting old.",Rounders

It focuses on the slightly too good to be true Matt Damon and his dodgy childhood pal Edward Norton, who uses Matt once too often. There are no big surprises, but it's a very watchable story in its unimaginative way. It's mercifully free of fancy camera angles and nervous cutting but not free from John Malkovich, who is at his worst, failing to convince us he's a Russian (!)

Damon is forced to straighten his life out in order to keep his girlfriend. Everything is fine until an old friend of his is let out of prison. Worm (Edward Norton) is a fellow card shark from Damon's youth and is a bad influence. Matt Damon's character seeks to win through superior skill, Worm is a scam artist, taking huge risks in search of the big payoff.The relationship between Damon and Norton is central to the movie. The tension that arises because of their differing methods and the fact that Damon is trying to stay out of the gambling world but keeps getting sucked in because of Norton. Eventually things spiral out of control and Damon has to decide which course his life will take. He can be a gambler or the guy with the girl, but not both.

All of these combine to make a film that surpassed all of my expectations. Never mind what others say about too much poker lingo being used in the film, it holds no important affect for those who don't know the game. Never mind what others say about Matt Damon's lack of acting ability, he comes through in this film with a performance up to ""Good Will Hunting"" standards. Never mind what others say about the film's all too predictable ending, regardless of it, the tension still builds up quite nicely.I liked this film because the story never strays causing the viewer to lose interest in the film. Not once did I lose interest here, regardless of my biased love for the game of poker. Ed Norton shines in his performance playing ""Worm"" as if it was his true alter-ego. One really must wonder why Damon's character puts up with all of the Shenanegans that Worm puts him through - the guy just doesn't seem the type you would want to keep as a friend. John Malkovich also gives a small but smart performance as Johnny KGB, a masterful poker player, but a loose cannon otherwise. Perhaps my favourite part of the film was when the camera pans on his stack of Oreo cookies and a ""Don't Touch"" sign that would make most laugh at the sight.John Turturro and Martin Landau also give strong performances in smaller roles, adding to the depth of talent this film has. John Dahl did well here to get the true feel of the gambling underworld and the highs and lows that accompany it.

The final game between him and Mike is anti-climactic, and somewhat ruins the rest of the picture. The ending is too upbeat for a story about professional gambling - it is a Hollywood fantasy. *********END SPOILER*************Overall, the lure of the quick score that sucks people into (all forms of) gambling is well portrayed.

96,paul-nemecek,Rounders Falls A Bit Flat,7,1 July 2018,"The rapidly growing numbers of Matt Damon fans have probably been anxiously awaiting the release of his latest film Rounders. This is a film that really is worth waiting for. That is, I would recommend waiting until it comes to video, cable, or network (this is one film that might actually be improved by being dismembered to accommodate commercials). The good news for Matt Damon is ""it's not your fault, it's not your fault.""The acting is one of the better ingredients in this somewhat predictable and poorly written film. Matt Damon and Edward Norton Jr. both turn in solid performances as two friends who were hustling card sharks until Worm (Edward Norton Jr.) gets sent to prison. While Worm is in prison Mike McDermott (Matt Damon) loses his law school tuition, rent money, and everything else when he gambles $30,000 dollars in a high-stakes poker game. McDermott's girlfriend convinces him to give up gambling and walk the straight and narrow. When Worm gets out of prison, McDermott discovers that his friend is deep in debt and in serious trouble with loan sharks. This sets up the central tension of the movie. Should he be faithful to his friend and exercise his gift with cards to help him out or should be keep his promise to his girlfriend and let Worm fend for himself?This is also the point at which those betting on the film would be wise to fold. When McDermott's girlfriend leaves him, nobody really seems to care, including the couple themselves. Plot points and characters are seriously underdeveloped so that the suspense and drama comes in bits and pieces. There are moments of writing that are inspired. There are even more moments that are seriously flawed. The central theme of the movie is provided by one of McDermott's law school professors (played by Martin Landau) who tells him ""you don't choose your destiny, your destiny chooses you."" It is hard to resist comparing this to another Matt Damon film where he has an unusual gift. In Good Will Hunting Damon is a mathematical genius that minimizes his gift as his way of being loyal to his friends. In the end he must choose between capitalizing on his gift or pursuing love. Here Damon's gift is poker, and he must choose between poker on the one hand and love and law school on the other. The themes of the films are almost antithetical, and Good Will Hunting is so much better written.If you must have a fix of Matt Damon, I would recommend another look at Good Will Hunting, Rainmaker or Saving Private Ryan. In spite of some great performances here, when all is said and done Rounders is quite a bit short of a full house.",Rounders

This isn't that bad, it's just not that good, either.  There are better gambling films out there that deal with this theme, and I'm tempted to rent them again, including ""The Hustler"" and ""California Split"", which I haven't seen in many years.

I have seen the movie and why she has this part, I don't know. It's a short part, 3 scenes I guess. If you are a fan, you will be disapointed. But I did not see the movie for Famke, I did see it because of the gambling and the characters. Well, I wish the writers did a better job, because you hardly get to know them, not even Damon. Using a voice-over, well it hardly works. But I did enjoy the movie, because the shallowness and loneliness off this gambling existence is very touchable in this movie. You can feel why he has this need to play, and why he has plays while he know that even winning means you lose (Karate Kid 3, mr. Miagi to Danielsan) And thats why I love this ending.

101,T-10,an educational experience,9,27 November 1998,"Rounders was a learning experience.  It is a well written and acted tale of ins and outs of high stakes poker.  The audience is introduced to a whole new language that describes the game and also given insight to the psychology of it as well.  Mr. Damon had to have done some serious prepa ration to handle the language and mind set of professional poker player.  He continue s to light up the screen with his boy next door good looks and his brazen honesty even in a character of mixed morals.  I guess that's what makes his performances so appealing.  Mr. Norton was excellent as well and has shown great latitude in his recent performances as well.  The relation ship between the two is well developed and interesting and they complement each other well.  Strong and weak, straight forward and shady, and smart and well not too smart (failed cunning) makes for an intere sting pair which in this case beats a full house.  I learned never to sit down at a poker table where I don't know everyone, but I enjoyed sitting in the theater watching this film and everyone else seemed to as well.

102,Ryan_9,Strong acting carries it,7,8 October 2021,"I thought Rounders was good and an interesting take on gambling. It starred Matt Damon (Mike McDermott) as a reformed gambler who returns to playing with his troubled friend Worm (Edward Norton). At the same time, he has to balance his girlfriend, Jo (Gretchen Mal), and law school.The acting was the strongest part of this film as Damon and Norton were both excellent. I thought both characters were well portrayed and likable. John Malkovich (Teddy KGB) did a stellar job as the Russian mobster. I liked how he picked up a Russian accent for this. The scenes between him and Damon were great. John Turturro (Joey Knish) was good and played a smart ally to Mike. Each character had strong dialogue too.I'll admit the writing and direction could've been better as it goes all over the place at times. The story drags on towards the end and becomes predictable. There wasn't any real suspense either which bummed me. I also would've liked to have known what happened to Worm at the end. His ending felt anti-climatic to me.Overall, I'll give Rounders a 7/10.

The actors give you most of the enjoyment; a very good music score adds quite a lot. But, unfortunately, the screenplay hardly helps.No-Limit Texas Hold 'Em is supposed to be the real star here, I guess... But most of us will just dismiss this as poker hyperbole. ""The Cadillac of Poker"" is a title I do not respect; I don't even like Cadillacs. The game is the all-surrounding ocean in which the actor-players swim, but it is just... a... game... after all, folks. Yeah, the cameo appearances of real-life Poker All-Stars (so-called) are supposed to awe us. Sorry; I'm not at all awed.

All provide a fine foundation for Matt Damon's great job in the leading role. These good folks help to rescue the viewing experience.I finally figured out why I always like watching such films as ""Rounders, ""The Hustler,"" and ""The Color of Money"".

The roles of the principles are difficult and very well played.  My only disappointment was that the Damon character is so unconnected, except to his girlfriend and a judge.

One problem is the density of the technical info thrown at you - straights, flushes and low-hi 30-40s (or something) go in one ear and out the other, which would be OK if it didn't matter to the build-up of tension - but it does! The final game is a damp squib because we really don't have a clue what's going on. Another problem is some of the performances. John Malkovich has a truly preposterous (Russian!?) accent and wouldn't frighten a kitten, but he's supposed to be The Man who's supposed to put the fear of God into Matt Damon, who in turn just can't carry such an intense role, I'm afraid.

At the end, when Matt Damon defeats KGB, you want to find the nearest gambling joint...But the film does show us the dangers of the world of gamblers and card sharks. Matt goes broke and calls it a day in the beginning of the film. But after his buddy Worm drags him back, he knows that all he really wants and is good at is poker.Matt never hits rock bottom (like all gamblers do once in their 'çareer'). He goes broke yes, but he still has his girl, a house and a job. Most gamblers who hit bottom end up with only the clothes on their back. If there is a critique, it's that. It doesn't let it's main character experience the real downs of a gambling existence.But that's all the bad things I can say about this film. The bad news the gambling world has to offer comes in Worm (an excellent Norton). The film has colorful and realistic characters. The dialog is authentic and film has a 'real feel' to it. I love these 'small' films, in contrary to all the 100 trillion dollar blockbuster with special effects that come out every week. Too bad Hollywood doesn't make more films like this one.",Rounders
110,kmberger,'The Hustler' of card movies.,8,19 November 2002,"'Rounders' is to poker players as 'The Hustler' was to pool sharks.  It's a literate, informed film that gives a glimpse into the lives of men and women that most people can't even begin to understand; an entire subculture that exists just below the surface of everyday life.Matt Damon plays Mike McD, a poker player who lost everything he had in a huge pot to a Russian mobster (John Malkovich), and tries to leave that life behind him as he heads off to law school.  As an old friend Worm Murphy (Edward Norton) is released from jail, Mike realizes that not only hasn't he really left his past behind, but he never really meant to in the first place.'Rounders' is a quiet movie with a subtle script that is filled with poker jargon (if you don't know the game, it takes a couple viewings to really follow the card-playing scenes).  It's not splashy or outrageous; it's a series of character studies that look into the lives of people who play cards for a living - people to whom the words 'gambling' and 'luck' are vulgarities.  It's a well-written script, with tons of quotable and memorable lines.  Just check the quotes section on the main page for a sampling - everyone has attitude to spare, since showing even a hint of weakness is death at the card table.  (""If you can't spot the sucker in the first half-hour at the table, then you ARE the sucker."") Essentially, 'Rounders' is an acting clinic.  Top-notch talent is used here, the best of which are Damon and Norton.  Damon's everyman card shark is just on the border of respectibility, and has a sense of duty and loyalty that haven't been seen since the days of chivalry - but Damon is at his best here, disarmingly charming, easygoing, but with a heart of stone at the table.  Norton's Worm is a degenerate all the way, but still with that leftover rebelliousness from his youth that just invites trouble wherever he goes.  Also good here are Malkovitch as mobster Teddy KGB (although with a thick and silly accent) and John Turturro as the eternal grinder Joey Knish. The only weak spot in the cast is Gretchen Mol as Mike's girlfriend Jo - she's eternally whiny, cloying and obnoxious, and it's quite unbelievable that Mike would ever have settled down with a woman like this.All in all, though, 'Rounders' achieves a good dramatic pace, excellent dialogue, and makes every poker game seem like the finals of the World Series of Poker: everything on the line for a million bucks.  It owes almost everything it has to 'The Hustler', but there are worse films to lend inspiration.",Rounders

Matt Damon, whose Good Will Hunting made him a star, proved to us once again that Best Actor nom was no fluke. Not that much prove was necessary. Eddy Norton, Martin Landau, and John Malkovitch {even though his accent kinda sucked} were terrific. As was Famke Janssen and Gretchen Mol and most of the other peformers. The only person who annoyed me was John Turtorro. It wasn't him, but the character. I really liked this movie, though. No one makes movies about card games. This showed the genius of it.

Here we see poker as gambling, but what it is, is it's a game of skill, and of luck, if you put two and two together, you will win high, lose low. But you will lose, yet you will win.This film lacked so much, it could really have been something, but the story failed to intrigue, it failed to teach the audience about the characters, all we saw was some ordinary people, I mean I could walk down the street and do that everyday for free.I was about 10 minutes left of the film and I looked at the time and thought ""hell this movie is supposed to finish soon, I thought so much more was going to happen"" and it didn't, it was overall, an OK film, nothing I would ever watch again, but if you're a novice at poker, I suggest you watch it, as it has some pretty onto it key-points every poker player should learn.",Rounders

The biggest surprise came in the form of Matt Damon, who I am gaining quite a respect for, and the most likeliest candidate to receive my `Actors Who I Have Tried To Hate, But Just Can't Bring Myself To It' award.

Terrific score and great monologue. ""If you can't spot the sucker in the first half an hour at the table, then you are the sucker."" The big hand Mike loses all his money is pretty much a no choice situation A9rag flop holding A9 then 9 hits the turn and a rag on the river. Only hand that beats you is AA, which is the case ace and with no raise pre-flop it is impossible to get away from this. You could possibly not raise at the end, but that's about it. The key is not to escalate the pot with A9 to begin with. But it's a cooler regardless.The judges stud game is a bit silly, but still abundantly enjoyable regardless. Mike says what they all have, in stud you can see 2 of a player's 4 cards on 4th street so you can guess what they have or are drawing at, but it is only a guess, you can't know. However by saying what they all have, Mike convinced them that he is betting a hand that beats those hands, and he only had a straight draw which didn't hit, so by them folding it worked. Because the guy with 2 pair may have called if he hadn't of told him what he was holding and still bet into him. :)Ahh the dream girl Joe ""Gretchen Mol"", ""You just told me you that you felt alive for the first time at a f***ing card table, what the hell is that suppose to make me understand.""

Base dealing Mike the nuts all the time. A player picks up on it, even though Mike wasn't raising and folding some because it was becoming too obvious.

The problem is that the film sends out the wrong message. It says that if you are young, intelligent, and handsome you can overcome- even the greatest of odds, and come out a big winner.Mike McDermott (Matt Damon), a young attorney, who has given up gambling, after losing his case and law school money to a Russian Mafia boss, who calls himself KGB.McDermott swears off gambling forever until he has to bail out his best friend, an ex-con named ""Worm"" (Edward Norton). Worm was sent to prison for making thousands of dollars through a credit card scam, and still owes his creditors over ten thousand dollars in loan money.Together Worm and McDermott hit the streets of New York, looking for every possible card game in hopes of winning back the money Worm owes. When Worm finally has enough money to pay back his number one creditor, (John Turturro) he digs an even deeper hole for himself by taking out more loan money, instead of just closing his account. This puts a tremendous burden on McDermott, who must choose between loyalty to his friend and keeping his wife (Gretchen Mol) to whom he swore off gambling.Together Worm and McDermott wind up $15,000 in the hole through losing several hands at poker and even get beaten up a couple of times. Finally McDermott is forced to vouch for Worm, trying to get his friend on payment program to save him from danger. However the creditor, (Turturro) demands his money -all of it- within five days, and now McDermott having vouched for Worm is also responsible for it. Damon borrows $15,000 from his good hearted law professor (Martin Landau) to save Norton's hide and ultimately his own.Now how can the ""hero"", Damon, take advantage of the generosity of a friend the way he does? But this is Rounders. A movie about gambling and the mafia should show gambling as a sickness that destroys the integrity and possibly the life of the main character. But Damon comes out of it smelling like a rose, and then heads to Las Vegas to bet even more money. Damon's is a talented performer, but ""Rounders"" shows little purpose in conveying the right message.""Rounders"", doesn't lecture on the evils of gambling, it promotes them.

It is such an excellent film. Matt Damon shows his best performance in this other than his role in ""Good Will Hunting"". Edward Norton does great as Damon's shady best friend (and strangely reminds me of Sean Penn in this film). John Dahl directed a great movie. The script is very well written. David Levien and Brian Koppelman really know their s*** as far as the poker world goes (but really failed with their directorial debut of ""Knockaround Guys"").This movie isn't for your modern day movie watcher, since it's all about acting and story.

123,barrwell,like poker? you will love this film...!!,8,17 September 2010,"You may love this film even if you don't like poker. Just how good can a film about a particular subject like poker be? Think about a subject like say....bowling... how good could a movie about bowling be? Well, maybe it comes down to the people making the film, and in the case of Rounders those people are very good. John Dahl, who made his mark making neo-noir cult classics like Red Rock West and The Last Seduction, shows a sure hand and an insight into the world of poker. The two lead actors, Matt Damon and Edward Norton, are absolutely perfect in their roles. The finished product is an absolute gem.As the film begins we see Mike (Damon) lose his bankroll to a Russian mobster Teddy KGB (John Malkavich, also perfect) playing Texas low-hold poker. He ends up getting a delivery job for long time rounder Knish (John Turtorro) and settles into life in law school with his girlfriend (Gretchen Mol). Its not a bad life, but deep inside we know that Mike still craves the life of a gambler. When his longtime partner, the sleazy card mechanic Worm (Ed Norton) gets out of jail, things change quickly for Mike. We in the audience know even before Mike himself knows....he's going to go back to the poker table.As Mike gets back into that life he quickly becomes less interested in law school and starts getting in trouble with his girlfriend. He also gets in debt to a local gambling hall, who he instructed to loan money to Worm. Worm takes full advantage of course, as you would expect by this point. As I watched this character develop my first thought was...I know someone just like this! My second thought was of what a great performance Ed Norton gives here. I can't even put into words just how perfect he is as the Worm; it has to experienced.This film is something of a mood-piece, as well as a sort of character study. Mike grows in this film not only as a person but as a poker player, meanwhile Worm moves in the other direction, as trouble and debt mount his instinct is to run or hide (or both). When their backs are against the wall its Mike who wants redemption while Worm starts to cave in. It's an interesting twist on the characters; before it was Mike giving up and taking the safe route with Worm always pushing the odds. Maybe hitting rock bottom is how you find out who you really are.I think one of the main themes here is this; are we going to be satisfied being what polite society tells us to be or should we follow our hearts...even if it may lead us into some troublesome results?Inevitibly, Mike's at a crossroads as his girl has given up on him and the law school career starts going down the tubes. Meanwhile, Worms debts have added up to the point that a local thug (Michael Respoli), who happens to work for Teddy, has bought up the debt and has given a deadline. Mike and Worm go on a days-long poker spree in an attempt to settle up.As the film reaches its climax Mike finds himself back at Teddy's place for a showdown with the Russian. Can Mike finally turn the tables on Teddy and get all the debts erased? Its a really well staged finale and we are reminded of what an excellent actor Matt Damon can be with the right material.At the end Mike finds his true destiny and, to me, it is a satisfying conclusion...we are what we are. It's not necessarily a happy ending, yet its not sad either...its real...and its a real solid movie! I love the very final scene as Mikes cab heads down a busy New York street to a song written for this movie by The Counting Crows, ""Baby I'm a big star now"". Great song that fits perfectly, its well worth watching through the credits to hear it, but you won't hear it on commercial TV.My advice...(as always)..is watch this film uncut. 3-1/2 out of 4.",Rounders

I like all the realism involved and i especially liked the ending because it also seemed realistic. Edward Norton who played ""Worm"" is a gambling finatic much like his friend Mike McDermott the only difference between the two characters is the Worm tries to run from all of his problems. The ending had Norton leaving Damon in fear of his gambling debt, while Damon finishes off head to head with John Malkovich a dangerous KGB guy. The finality of the movie has Damon riding a cab to Vegas, while he could persue being a lawyer but realizes he sucks at it anyway, and he loses the girl and the friend which is cool because it sort of makes you relate to what could really happen in real life.",Rounders

While trying to stay away from the action and the dangerous underground poker sites, the arrival Worm (Ed Norton), Mike old school buddy, thrust him back into the gambling world. Worm is sleazy, unreliable and has a penchant for trouble. John Malkovich, Famke Jannsen, John Turturro (who never seems to get starring roles), Martin Landau and Gretchen Mol all provide strong performances.

The reason I say you almost have to admire this movie is that here you have Ed Norton, one of the best actors of his time, Matt Damon, no slouch either, and Gretchen Mol, who gets poor roles a lot of times but is pretty good in spite of that, and John Malkovich who is routinely great...and it's boring.

The cast was anchored by such masters as Ed Norton, John Malkovich and John Turturro, and yet, it fell shamefully short. My primary complaint with ""Rounders"" is the casting of Matt Damon as a hard-core, habitual gambler. That's about as believable as Sharon Stone bedecked in Versace flipping burgers at McDonald's.My second complaint is the women in this film. Were they simply placed on screen as ""filler"". The characters were utterly superfluous and added nothing to the plot. A plot that was as thin as Famke Janssen's legs.My final complaint was Malkovich's over-the-top portrayal of a Russian ""mobster"". It was completely ree-DEEK-u-lose! I have utter respect for him as an actor. His range is awe inspiring. But this was just laughable. Last I checked, ""Rounders"" was not intended to be a comedy.So, that's what's wrong with the movie.

Predictability of the plot has been noted here many times and I agree.

I had the feeling everything was quite authentic and apparently I wasn't fooled since many commenters here who are familiar with the game confirmed the authenticity.Expect, however, a fair share of unknown terms (which often aren't explained) if you don't know poker quite well.As a last remark, I consider this a typical ""guy"" movie. That is, watch it with your mates/buddies, possibly with a supply of whiskey and cigars (but don't overindulge or you will miss many of the film's subtleties).

Considering how Hold 'Em has developed into one of the biggest social fads in the last decade, I would say that this film captures every emotional aspect the 'swings' of No Limit typically carry.I had absolutely no idea how to play the game when I first saw this movie about five years ago. The dialogue is wrought with jargon that almost makes a mockery of itself. Especially since much of the movie is done with voice-over, I can see where critics are coming from. However, the viewer should not allow themselves to get bogged down with it all, we get the gist with well-developed staging and performances.Damon and Norton play off each other better than Damon and Affleck. Though the story echoes in the wake of Scorsese's 'Mean Streets', the performances seem more detailed than the Keitel/DeNiro combo. The supporting roles add great depth to the film, and Tutorro shines as the wise-old has-been that successfully provides Damon's character with the cold-hard truth he never seems to adhere to (until it is too late).Above all, we feel compelled to cheer for Damon's Mike McDermott the ENTIRE time. He acknowledges his 'bad' play but constantly tries to explain that this is a game of skill and not luck. This is an important element considering the widely accepted belief that any success in gambling is the result of luck. This may be true in the bloodsucking casinos, but in Hold 'Em you play the chips AND the man.Now that baseball is out of the Olympics, perhaps we will see a push for a true ""WORLD Series of Poker"". Then again, I also wanted to see 'Four Square' made into an official event when I was 8, so maybe I'm just talking out of my ass...Should be commended as a precursor to a pandemic fad that is costing teens (and their parents) millions daily.*** (of ****)",Rounders

Matt Damon really totally fits the description of a good the guy who is trying to achieve something in life, right, who has the ambition and who would never cheat on poker table.

In short, the writing was an admirable try, but for me, it flopped.  The only things that made this movie somewhat entertaining were the performances of Damon, Norton, John Malkovich, John Turturo, and Martin Landau. But now some of my questions:  1.)  When exactly does Damon's character sleep?  When we first meet him, he is going to law school during the day, driving a truck at night, and then repeating the same cycle; 2.)  When does Michael (Damon) study?  Law school is certainly more than going to classes, and we're led to believe that he is moderately successful in school until the end.  Can't do that without studying a whole lot; 3.)  Why does Gretchen Mol stick around as long as she did?  4.)  Why can't I have friends like Michael as the worm did?  This guy took advantage like no one should have, from borrowing Michael's money to forcing him back into the card games; 5.) Speaking of worm (an aptly named character), what happened to him?  No one ever says, as far as I could tell; 6.)  And finally, how was Michael paying for rent and a car after his girlfriend has had enough?  7.)  Finally, part two:  Why can't I have acquaintances like the professor who will write me a check for $10,000 to repay a gambling debt? Now, I more than understand the ""willing suspension of disbelief"", but with this many questions, it was tough to enjoy the plot.  Again, it overshadowed some good performances, especially noteworthy was a chilling performance by Malkovich (KGB).

Edward Norton, the pride of Columbia, Maryland, shows why he will be this generation's Eric Roberts as he portrays the buddy who gets Matt Damon in trouble and whom I personally would have shunned.

155,corway-2,This movie thinks it's better than it is,5,30 July 1999,"WARNING:  These comments contain spoilers!Actually, the movie is already spoiled.  I rented this movie last night thinking that with such an impressive cast, I would be wholly drawn into a great movie.  No such luck.  Or, as Damon's character mentions, it's not really about luck -- it's a game of skill.  And that's what this film is lacking.The film's strong points are terrific characters brought to life by Edward Norton and John Turturro.  These very different poker pros don't meet in this film, but they both tug on Damon's character is different directions: Turturro encourages Damon to play it safe, Norton encourages Damon to risk and cheat.  What an interesting film it would have been if it had been a drama focusing on these three characters and the resulting struggle within Damon.  Rather, this film is about Damon's circle from gambling law student, to giving up gambling, and then giving up law to become a gambler.  And the movie portrays this in a good light.  He's the hero because he follows his dream to gamble.  What?  Damon and the other stars give half-baked, phoned-in performances (excepting Norton and Turturro).The script is also defective.  Some things just don't make sense.  Damon and Norton are severely beaten after they are caught cheating in a game (which made sense -- I thought the film was taking a better direction at that point), but then they argue about it and Norton's character is suddenly absent from the rest of the movie.  Oops?  Did the writers forget this character?  Martin Landau's law professor character gives Damon $10,000 to help pay off his friend's debt.  Really?  Don't we all wish we had teachers like this?  Damon's girlfriend leaves him because he lies to her about one game AFTER ABSTAINING FROM GAMBLING FOR NINE MONTHS!!  Is she perfect?  Is this how a rational human being would react?  Lying is a terrible thing, but most real life relationships go through much worse than one lie -- and still survive.The bottom line is that all the losers stay losers, and no one learns anything.  But the movie doesn't play it that way -- it portrays Damon as a hero, and that gambling is a profession, not an addiction.  And unless you are a card player and/or familiar with pro poker jargon, a good portion is likely to lose you and bore you.  Skip this one.",Rounders

If you are into Texas Hold Em, watch this movie. Really enjoyed the poker scenes; you get to see the entire hand play out when Mike plays KGB. Basically, good guy Mike is a poker hound and prides himself on reading players' ""tells"". He narrates his experience with playing poker, getting burned in a hand with KGB and losing everything. His BFF, Worm, also a poker hound, is getting paroled. Mike picks him up from prison because he owes Worm. Worm took a rap for him and ended up with the prison sentence; Mike is grateful that he has such a good friend. Problem is, Worm is exactly what his name means....a worm. His method of playing is cheating and he gets into trouble, a lot. Worm wants to get back into the action and making money; Mike is struggling to make his way through law school. Mike helps him find poker games. He goes out of his way for Worm, even vouching for him for his debts. In the end Worm lives up to his name and Mike gets screwed over. The boys crash the Friday night, state police poker night. Worm gets caught cheating, the guys get roughed up and kicked out; all their money gone. Mike finally lets Worm have it and sees him for what he is... a loser. Edward Norton is at his best when he plays slimy characters and he shines here. But since Mike vouched for Worm, he has to pay off his debt. He goes to KGB - Russian mafia - engages in an all nighter and wins money back to pay off Worm's debt. I do have a few annoyances with this film and although they sound significant, they in no way turn me off from it. 1) Why does Hollywood love jargon so much? The jargon in this film gets old after about 5 minutes, but we have to put up with it through the whole film. I seriously doubt the WPT players ever talk this. 2) Mike and Worm get the living daylights beat out of them at the state police game. Aside from a few scratches and some facial blood, they look great. Where's the swollen, black eye? The swollen, split lip? The contusions? The hematoma? Make up sucks in this film. 3) Final big scene - Mike is head to head with KGB. Mike needs to win at least ""15 thou"" to pay off Worm's debt and cover ""the juice"". Of course, he spots KGB's tell. He should have ignored it, he needs to win big time. But he calls KGB out. His narration indicates that he normally wouldn't so he could ""bust him up all night, but he only has until morning"". Stupid. If you need to win, you wouldn't expose a tell! 4) I don't like Counting Crows; lead singer's voice is whiny, melodies sound like adult nursery rhymes. Except for one song which is played during the credits. ""Baby I'm a Big Star Now"". Best song they ever did, great tune. However, it was never released.

Most times it was hard to believe the card-shark side of his character because he just looks so preppy and...well...lawyerly! b) Martin Landau's character seemed unbelievable too. His ""wise tales"" and willingness to lend Damon's character $10,000 just didn't cut it with me.

I'm not saying ""Rounders"" should have turned into a 12-Step spiritual-fest, but that sad reality was never even acknowledged by any of the characters.My rating: 5 out of 10.

161,Sy1975,Poker fan or not - this is a great movie,9,14 October 2015,"Why do some truly awful movies do well and other truly great movies like Rounders get lost in the dross. I just happened to come across this on UK Netflix by chance. Matt Damon, Ed Norton, John Malkovic looked a great cast for starters, its about poker, decent looking love interest - even better.The story and characters draw you in immediately, the scene is set although not giving too much away. Norton's character is not introduced immediately, which I liked. Matt Damon holds the film together comfortably with some strong supporting performances especially from Malkovic.Poker is the main theme of the movie, the question mark over the rights and wrongs of gambling, the obvious skills and intelligence that these professional poker players have. Its not really for or against the movie sits on the fence allowing the viewer to draw their own conclusions (another sign of a great Director).To not give the game away, yes I saw the final act coming, there is no massive twist, but this does not take you away from the enjoyment and your willingness to watch till the final credits.

163,dtburr,What is GOING ON?????,9,27 July 2005,"This is tribute to how good this movie is. I am not necessarily a Matt Damon fan, and I know beans about poker. For all I know, the scenes in the movie have no technical merit from a poker standpoint.Who cares? This move is absolutely loaded! The characters and the acting are incredible, from Damon (Mike) to Norton (Worm) to Malkovich (""Teddy KGB"") to Landau (Prof. Abe Petrovsky) , and yes, even Rispoli (Gramma). I can't miss a scene, even though I have seen the thing 25 times. The story is good, the screenplay better. But the directing in this film is exceptional. It is what made the movie. Almost all characters are believable and totally engaging. Shot selection is top notch. Just watch it! This is no low-budget movie with the typical low-budget concessions. It has it all. In fact, from a directing standpoint, only the ""fraternity boys"" in the early card game were ridiculous caricatures. OTOH, they were making an attempt to segment the various types of ""opponents"", and some viewers are potentially pretty dumb, so I can cut them slack here.The only other flaw I saw in the movie - my opinion - is that the part of Jo (Gretchen Mol), Mike's girlfriend, was miscast. I thought that Mol was too ""cute"". I think it would have been okay to have a more believable ""lawyer-in-training"". You could still have someone good-looking - just don't make me want to touch her cute little nose and then cup my hands on her ears, all the time smiling really wide, and give her a sweet little kiss. That's Gretchen Mol. Lawyers aren't like that.I also thought that there was a ""hole"" in the film because Mike and Jo had a pretty deep relationship, but they broke up rather abruptly and there was no resolution. Granted that this was a side-story, but it was part of who Mike was, so it was important to do something with it, especially at the end where they had their last exchange. It didn't seem believable for people who felt about each other the way they should have.I read reviews from poker experts who say that the filmmakers went the extra mile and stayed true to the game, and that just reaffirms my thoughts about this movie. It's a real work of art and one of the best of its era.",Rounders

168,primate45,interesting poker film. gut wrenching losses. but not a great film.,5,19 April 2006,"It was a must-see simply because of an interest in poker. It brought some new perspective to the game, but the plot of the film wasn't entirely enthralling. Matt Damon had a great performance as a young former high-rolling poker player who lost his fortune one night and had to work his way from the bottom so he can make it through law school. The trouble comes when a no-goodnik friend gets out of prison, and has to repay a huge debt. Damon is torn from his poker-free life, and is used by his friend for all he's worth. The movie has a bit of a fairytale ending, and much of the movie has twists and turns that couldn't be predicted more easily if the viewer had a map. However it talked about the concept of regrets, and likened it to a loss in poker. We never remember the many great hands we played to build up our fortunes. We only remember that one hard loss. However it's important to let go of the past, and to focus on the present. To change what can be changed in the here and now. Additionally it warns of the dangers of being too selfless. Of putting faith and fidelity and trust in another, and not looking out for oneself. It will screw you. It wasn't that beautiful of a movie or that well constructed. But it was interesting for me to see the poker underworld, and two guys trying to scrape together a huge amount of money playing poker. It also made a good effort at implanting some messages in there. If you're interested in poker, see this movie which was before the Hold'em craze. If not, don't feel bad skipping it. And remember, if it doesn't make you think, it's not worth your time. -Michael",Rounders

This movie overworks every little aspect of what a rookie might think is important, but in the end it falls flat...it basically involves Damon as an excellent poker player trying to go legit via law school, and his buddy 'worm' (Norton) whom he is indebted to help after Norton is released from prison; Norton's character is a smart-mouth poker snipe who, of course, gets into too much debt, and Damon must play a high stakes poker game to keep said smart-mouth idiot from a double knee-capping and a one-way ride. That's IT. That's the whole movie....Landau is wasted as the kindly mentor of Damon, Malkovich should receive some award for the worlds worst Russian accent EVER, (""Doo kyou khaaave my myoney?"" he croaks at one point, Boris Badenov had a better rusky accent!) then reveals the biggest 'tell' EVER, even though he is an expert poker player. And Norton, supposedly the center of all this, is not even in the last 1/3rd of the movie...!

Martin Landau as the kindly judge who dishes out some advice and money, seems tired with his character and the whole atmosphere of the sets. Actually, everyone seems to be brought down by a film that really never answers any questions and never goes anywhere.

John Malkovich gave a great performance with a terrific Russian accent.
Matt Damon's performance was very reminnescent of that which he gave in ""Good Will Hunting.""  The character Damon plays in ""Rounders"" is same type of poor, working guy who is smarter than all of his friends.  I think this is Damon's best type of performance.  Given that he was excellent in ""The Talented Mr. Ripley,"" which is one of my favorite movies, Damon's ability to play the regular type of guy is what makes him so likeable.  He can pull it off better than anyone else today.Rounders takes time to develop.  It makes the watcher learn the intricate parts of different types of poker games.  If you don't like gambling or poker, keep your distance from this one.  In the grand scheme of things, ""rounders"" is a good poker movie.  It is better than ""The Cincinatti Kid,"" but of course it can't hold a candle to ""The Sting.""  Either way, its an enjoyable movie, with a good soundtrack, and really nice cinematography.

While it is a great movie, Maverick inaccurately portrays poker as a game of chance where any ol' fool can draw an ace of spades and get a royal flush to win a poker tournament. ""Ha"" is what I say to that. Rounders, on the other hand, sets the record straight. Poker is a very complex skill game and many times during the movie, Rounders will tell you this.Anyway, Rounders is about a hardcore poker player Mike McDermott (Matt Damon) who quits the game after he loses it all in a hand of No Limit Texas Hold 'Em at a shady club run by Russian Mafia man Teddy KBG (John Malkovich). When Mike learns that his newly-out-of-prison friend Worm (Edward Norton) owes several thousand dollars to a couple of loan sharks, he gets back in the game and the two set out to make a big score and settle their debts.I highly recommend this movie for anyone who's in the least bit interested in poker.",Rounders

180,GreenHammer,"Pretty average movie, but Damon is quite good.",6,15 June 2005,"Rounders is one of those specialized movies where the only people who really love it, are those that love the subject matter (in this case poker).The movie explores some interesting themes like following your heart, friendship and loyalty, and trying to be the best. In the last theme its sort of similar to The Hustler or The Cincinnati Kid at least in the beginning scenes.Matt Damon does a great job of showing conceit, calmness, anger, and charm in his role. The movie sometimes gets too overly dramatic at times, and these are the only times Damon really fails, but he's probably the best thing about the movie.John Turturro does a good job, as well, of showing the very real life of some poker players, and tries to show Damon that poker isn't all glitz and glamor.The movie makes a large point of showing a conflicted Damon yearning for a good future but being held down by the past. The past is drawn out in the forms of Teddy KGB (Malkovich) and Worm (Norton). Their performances are okay, but frankly Nortons character is TOO annoying, and not interesting at all. His sub-plots are also very dull. They are necessary to carry the story along, but the movie still lags when his character shows up. Malkovich is over the top, and has the most obvious tell in the history of poker...i don't see how the hell KGB became a legend with that tell, a weak part of the script.The movies card scenes are good, and the relationship between Damon and Landau is very nicely done. The movie suffers most though from the unnecessary Damon/Mol relationship. Mol looks good but has a thankless wet blanket female role, and she and Damon have no chemistry whatsoever.

It's an entertaining film, but it seems unlikely that Mike (Matt Damon) could go through what he goes through and maintain such a sunny disposition and steadfast sense of honor.

Mike is quite cool and cerebral while Lester is more wild and neurotic.Even though he has proved of being able to play a wide range of characters I think every character played by Edward Norton is a bit neurotic.

Starring Matt Damon (Good Will Hunting and SPR) and Edward Norton (chilling supporting actor nominee for Primal Fear) with a superb supporting cast including John Turturro as Kinish, John Malkovich as KBG and Martin Landau as Professor Petrovsky, Rounders follows a card shark on the ""rounds"" from one poker game to the next in New York's underbelly back halls and clubs. Known as a great ""reader"" of people, Damon (Mike McDermott) has made his money for his law school education by using his skills at the poker table. His patient girlfriend (played convincingly by Gretchen Mol) has had enough of his late night/all night rounds, so, to keep her, he hangs up his deck, gets a regular job and becomes a full time student. That is, until Worm (Norton) is released from prison and must pay back a loan made prior to his incarceration. He enlisted Mike's help and out of gratitude for Worm's keeping him out of jail, Mike helps his old friend and in the process estranges his girlfriend and his poker friends as well as Worm builds up more debts under Mike's good name while trying to score big to pay off the loan.At times chilling and always entertaining, Rounders delivers a full house of good acting and great story.  Norton and Damon make a good team and Malkovich (always superb) outdoes himself here while Landau could well earn a supporting actor nomination for two of this year's films - X-Files: The Movie and Rounders.Rounders will make you think twice about ever sitting down at a poker table again.

192,capndawg,Acceptable poker movie,7,26 December 2000,"I mistakenly rated this movie 7 instead of 6.As an aspiring professional poker player (legitimate; in casinos), I found this movie to be very ENTERTAINING.  I capitalize ENTERTAINING because that does not comment on its artistic integrity.The following notes describe what is right with the movie:John Malkovich, Edward Norton, John Turturro and Martin Landau, need I say more?  Landau, Turturro and Malkovich perform on par, which is about three levels up from ""on par"" for many other actors.  Norton creates a character that is lovable and familiar.  Though perhaps many people who see the movie won't have a best friend who screws up quite as much as Worm (Norton), no one has a perfect best friend.  His humanity shows through in every move he makes.The visual aspects of this movie attributed to lighting and production design are phenomenal.  There is a scene early in the movie in which Mike (Matt Damon) and Joey (John Turturro) are standing on the sidewalk that takes my breath away every time I see it despite having watched the movie twenty or more times.The plot is excellent, providing the audience with a sense of tension despite the movie's Hollywood production.  Hollywood production leads the audience to the knowledge that everything will be ok and the status quo will be maintained by the end of the movie, as far as I'm concerned.Rounders is accessible enough that upon watching it, the audience is playing all the hands that Mike (Matt Damon) is playing and winning and losing with him.The things that are wrong with the movie are as follows:Gretchen Mol.  She couldn't act her way out of a cardboard box.There is one specific time (if you're not a serious poker player, you won't understand anyway) when Damon seems to misunderstand, or perhaps not understand at all what he is saying in terms of poker parlance.  This event falls in a voiceover at a major turning point in the movie, thereby cheapening the voiceover's effect if you do understand what he means.The end is predictable.  I won't say any more than that in the interest of not giving away the story to anyone who has not seen it.At the beginning of the movie, there is a piece of writing and/or direction that is bothersome: Teddy KGB (Malkovich) walks away from the poker table having just turned over a hand as if it couldn't have been beaten.  The fact is that he holds the second best hand possible and that Mike (Matt Damon) holds the third best possible hand.  Again, to the layman, this fact is likely not a problem, but to me, the scene was clearly artificial in that Malkovich's character walks away from the table as if he couldn't have been beaten when in fact, he could have been.  A minor inconsistency, but a problem to the aficionado.Overall recommendations:If you're a poker player who has read more than a few books on the subject, see the movie, but don't expect it to dazzle you in terms of its poker savvy.  If you've never played poker, watch it and enjoy it despite the whole Hollywood thing.  If you play poker at home with your friends recreationally, watch the movie, it may teach you something about how to play the game.  If you don't like poker or are a gambling addict, don't watch the movie; it makes you want to play poker.  If you like independent films and play poker less than once a year, don't watch this movie; you'll think its trash.",Rounders
193,priorae,Similar to Days of Thunder...,9,18 April 2002,"Just watched this again last night.As an avid card player and fan of the game, this movie is incredible.  I must watch it once every two or three months just for inspiration.  I'd imagine my reaction is similar to my brothers, who loves Nascar for some reason and swears Days of Thunder is the greatest movie ever.
This is a theme movie.  For card players, it'll be fascinating.  For movie lovers, its probably slightly above-average at best.  No fancy cinematography or special effects or comedy or plot twists.  Just a simple, predictable script with the all expected Hollywood finish.  However, like I mentioned, for poker players...its awesome.   I always laugh at the suckers in Atlantic City playing against the sharks, probably because I have been that sucker on a number of occasions.",Rounders
194,octavius9,Best gambling movie since The Color of Money.,10,11 April 2002,"Rounders is the best hustling movie in this decade.  The acting is as unbelievable as the script.

195,ironman0304manutd,One of the most widely underrated movies of our time,10,5 January 2005,"Rounders is I believe, one of the most widely underrated movies of our time.I first saw this movie as it was a 'bonus DVD' thrown in for free with my DVD player back in 2000, so naturally I didn't expect much (as the other bonus DVD's were very mediocre), but what I found was a very enjoyable movie.At that stage in my life, I had only played a little poker as a child growing up, and never 'Texas Hold'em' so to be honest, a lot of the terminology went 'over my head', but even so, the film became an instant favorite of mine purely because of the performances.The film has so much star power, and yet none of the fine actors try to 'steal' scenes. Damon, Norton, Malkovich, Landau ... and then the fine supporting cast of Turturro, Jansen, and Mol.In fact, there is a scene with Martin Landau and Matt Damon that is perhaps one of the most beautiful performances I have seen in a long time between two very fine actors.So even if you're not a poker player, the story is tighter than a lot of Hollywood 'pop fluff' and the performances alone can sell the film as an enjoyable movie capable of multiple viewings.But ... if you start playing poker and get really into what they are talking about, and reading about poker theory (like Doyle Brunson's book Super System) then the movie moves up to a whole different level.A lot of the time, Hollywood will attempt to cover a specialized error, and usually fail, or at best only partially succeed, whereas Rounders managed to get everything 'spot on', just look at the US DVD, it has a commentary track from 4 World Champion Poker players, if that's not a stamp of approval then I don't know what is.When you factor in how the film can be enjoyed by someone who has little to no idea about Poker (as I did when I first saw the film) just because of the tight story and stellar performances and also be 'immortalized' by poker enthusiasts as the best movie ever made on the subject (and truth be told, a big reason why the World Series of Poker has been doubling it's entries year after year) ... what you have here is a true gem that works on so many levels and what I believe is, as I said initially, one of the most widely underrated movies of our time.",Rounders
196,nomad20,Good middling poker movie,7,27 May 2006,"Spoiler regarding ""Rounders"" This is a solidly good and entertaining movie. It reminds me of my own poker games with friends, minus the threats of bodily harm.The casting is great and it's very well written; the film showcases how far men will go for their best friend.Overall, I would also recommend two other poker movies. The first is ""Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels,"" a hilarious movie that shows the brotherhood between men. The other is ""The Cincinnati Kid."" This one is better because you get a better sense that there's some humanity behind the bad guys, and plus, the surprise ending.All good movies.",Rounders
197,selfellows,great insight into the poker world,8,3 April 2005,"A great cast cast with great insight into poker world, Matt Damons love of the game is clearly reflected in a typically great Damon performance. The movie demonstrates great understanding of the poetry of poker, particularly Texas hold em while reflecting the dark underbelly of the rounder profession. Charismatic performances, especially from the great Martin Landau, and tight script all add up to a great poker classic. Although some elements may seem unrealistic, these moments are easily forgivable from adept performances and poker understanding. All novice poker players should watch and card conessoiurs should find the references and respect for the game pleasing, well worth watching!",Rounders
198,berserktripon,Why doesn't Hollywood make more movies like this?,10,28 February 2006,"This wasn't highly over-promoted and didn't involved flashy special effects. It was an interesting story, well-directed, with a fantastic cast. Have to give it a ten because it accomplished exactly what it strived to and then some.I loved this movie before the recent poker craze and it stands on it's own regardless of what it's focus is. That being said the writers did a good job of using enough technical card speak to interest you in the world but kept it simple enough to know what was happening, and the actors' delivery of lines made translation unnecessary: ""Wired aces or kings?""....""I had rags, but I HAD to know""....It's nothing incredibly new, the usual typical human drama, finding oneself, relationships lost, risk, loyalty, shades of gray with friends and enemies. But touches all points in a realistic and subtle manner The characters are a bit nicely dramatized and their roles sexed-up a bit to make it more interesting, which is OK. it works.The little things are all well done. A probably unnoticed scene when Worm and Mike arrive in the Atlantic City casino lobby and Mike chides Worm about the ""boys upstate bringing about a few changes"" is EXACTLY how two men in their mid twenties would act and talk toward one another. Completely aside from the story, but it really gives it credibility.And finally, kudos to the makers for the ending. Just fantastic. They could have spoiled the whole movie, but finished like figure skater making a perfect bow to the crowd.",Rounders
199,akapuck,Surprisingly Good,8,15 September 1998,"Don't be put off with reviews that knock Rounders for lack of plot or suspense.  For me, as an addict, there was plenty of suspense -- is the Matt Damon character a fish, a compulsive gambler, or is he a poker craftsman.Wonderful characters and a fascinating view, visually and through dialogue of inside-poker and the folks who make it their life.",Rounders
200,LMan,Rounders is an all aROUND good movie.,10,12 September 1998,"I went to see Rounders last night, and, needless to say, there were a lot of teenage girls there (ready to see Matt Damon, of course).  In fact, the entire row in front of me was filled with them. They seemed very excited. But, even though Damon was in it, the movie didn't seem to appeal to them. And it wasn't supposed to.  The brillantly written story begins with Mike (Damon, Good Will Hunting), a pre-grad law student, taking hundreds of dollars from hidden places in his apartment.  He then he leaves his apartment with the line ""If you can't spot the sucker in the first half hour at the table, then you are the sucker.""  The rest of the first act follows Mike as he loses all that money in a poker game which takes place in a hidden poker palace, owned by the infamous Teddy KGB, head of the russian mob (who loves Oreos).  The movie then skips to nine months later , where Mike has apparently stopped his poker playing, due to his girlfriend , Jo (Gretchen Mol).  We then discover that Mike is a true rounder, when telling a group of judges playing poker about every card in their hands. The transition to act two takes place when Mike goes to pick up his best friend, Worm (Edward Norton, Primal Fear), from prison.  He discovers that Worm has several debts he got from before his arrest. He has to pay them off.  Thus, against Jo's liking, Mike decides to help Worm out.  The movie follows them as Mike discovers that Worm isn't paying off just any rounder, but Teddy KGB himself.  Slowly, his tution and lover dissapear from his life, and the stakes become higher.  (A turning point of the movie is when Mike and Worm play a few hands with some cops.)  The characters were believable, the plot amusing, and the scenes at the card tables amazing. There you find that poker isn't just luck, but entirely the opposite.  With killer performances from Damon and Norton, Rounders is sure to impress. But a note to all teenage girls out there: Damon is not portraying a lovy -dovy idol in this movie, as he did in Good Will Hunting, but instead plays a rounder, a guy who earns his living at the tables, and lives by the number one rule of poker, ""Trust everyone, but cut the cards.""",Rounders
201,LadySaw,A solid film worth seeing...,8,18 September 1998,"Matt Damon stars in this likable story about poker. The story is engaging and refreshingly -- the film does not ""talk down"" to the viewer. There are many poker terms bandied about and time is not taken to explain each and every one -- something that you don't see often in the movies. The film is well-written and you are carried along with the action. Damon does an excellent job with a difficult part -- how do you act the part of someone whose best asset is that he doesn't react? Damon nails it. The supporting cast is tight -- standouts are Edward Norton, John Malkovich and John Turturro. The female characters are more weakly drawn and tend to be a bit one-dimensional, but the parts are handled ably by Gretchen Mol as the girlfriend and Famke Janssen as a rounder. Janssen does an especially nice job -- it would have been nice to see more of her character. Overall, I highly recommend this movie. It isn't the deepest movie to come out of Hollywood, but it is solid entertainment and it might stimulate a few conversations after viewing. But be careful -- everyone I saw this film with immediately wanted to start playing poker...",Rounders
202,mharms,John Dahl's Best,9,23 March 1999,This is John Dahl's best movie yet mainly because I didn't care for his other movies and because of strong performances from John Malkovich and Ed Norton.  Malkovich as KGB was an excellent adversary to our poker playing hero Matt Damon and Norton was an excellent foil.  Norton was the guy who would never grow up and refused to learn from his mistakes.  Damon was the poker veteran who could beat the best of them by playing it straight.  The parts I enjoyed most were those with either Malkovich or Turturro.  These actors are incredible and every moment they were on screen they had my utmost attention.  I'd watch it again for the inspiring card playing and for Malkovich.,Rounders

It is incredibly acted especially in the case of John Malkovich as KGB, and Edward Norton, as Les Murphy.  The plot is very interesting, and if you are a card player it is all the better because they sometimes neglect to explain in lamens what some of the terms the say mean.  The movie is very realistic and every time you watch it you pick more information, and more insight into the purpose of the movie.  The only slight negative I find in this movie is that at times it gets long during some of Mike's (matt damon) conversations, in particular with the professor.",Rounders

Watched it on a Sunday afternoon, and that's why I enjoyed the film the way I did - It is smoothly told, very unagitated shot film with little (but intense) physical action and lot of action on the poker table. I consider myself an amateur, but I know the basics and I know the World Series- but I get that when this film was released, Texas Hold'em didn't enjoy the popularity it does today. In this sense, the director is right in explaining the ground rules of the game in the films first minutes. After that, we have a rather typical ""must get x in short amount of time"" kind of plot, but it very slowly unfolds. Actually, it really gets going 50 minutes in when the main character is left by his girlfriend. Some shots and scenes are too ""slow"" for modern cinema and show the age of the movie (was released 18 years ago). Also, some sub-plots seem important in the beginning, are completely dropped in the middle and are somewhat disconnected from the rest of the film (the whole lawyer-subplot felt rather unnecessary in it's extent). The main character wants to pursue a career playing poker? OK, that's fine but we never get to know that before he actually makes this decision - in the beginning. poker is made up to be a means of earning money for the guy. In the end, we learn that he played Johnny Chan and won one single hand - that is his main motivation for his new career? Somewhat implausible!In the end, still very enjoyable and is able to transport the feelings and anxieties during a poker match very well7/10",Rounders

But it is interesting to watch the actors play. John Malkovich does a horrible job playing a Russian. No Russian speaks with that grotesque accent. Also, we don't eat Oreos, they are disgusting to us. Whoever wrote the KGB's character definitely has no clue about Russians. That made the whole movie difficult to believe.Edward Norton is a pleasure to watch, as always. Matt Damon does his usual thing of vulnerable decency with a hint of civilized manliness.

Until the 27th time I had no idea how to play Texas hold'em (NONE WHATSOEVER!) or any other game mentioned in the movie.The reason why I believe it is the greatest movie of all time are : phenomenal cast (everyone seems to agree with that), good story and the sheer moral of the movie (do what you want with your life).

But it does have a great cast and acting.  This is the story of Mike McDermott, poker -player.  All his life, Mike has been playing poker, and he's been good at it, pretty darn good.  So good in fact, that he thinks that maybe he can go up against one of the best in the world, Teddy ""KGB"" played by John Malkovich, who gives a stellar performance. In one hand, Mike loses everything, his money, his car, his pride.  All he has left now is his girlfriend, Jo (Gretchen Mol).  Jo represents the angel from the cartoons, you know the good conscience.  Then there's Worm (Edward Norton), who gets out of jail the day after Mike loses everything his life.

214,Stephk,Matt Damon isn't an actor.,5,13 September 1998,"This was a pretty disappointing film. It proves something I didn't necessarily want to know. Matt Damon is not a good actor. In fact, it's not acting at all. He plays the character in Rounders exactly the same as Will Hunting. As far as I'm concerned this film could have been called, ""Good Will Hunting for a Card Game."" Another appropriate title could have been, as a good friend calls all sequels, ""Good Will Hunting II, Electric Boogaloo."" The film was not boring, it could definetely hold your attention for two hours. It certainly didn't leave much to talk about afterwards, however. The ending is highly predictable. The attempt to make the gambling scene as realistic as possible isn't incredibly admirable. It's not even that interesting. The bottom line of this movie is that it was a vehicle to try and further Matt Damon's career (and perhaps to prove that he can act sans best friend, Ben Affleck.) It only proves that he is a somewhat charming kid who is playing himself in every role.",Rounders

I think that Matt Damon was fantastic. It is pretty hard to believe that an actor can play a part as well as John Malkovich did. This guy is probably the most underrated actor that I can think of. The last scene is a classic, and in the mini rampage that Malkovich puts on is unreal.  To think a man with that accent played Lennie Small in Of Mice and Men.

If you don't particularly like poker, you may find yourself wanting to play after seeing this film. Although some plot elements are poorly developed - especially the relationship between Matt Damon's character and his girlfriend - others are annoyingly real. Damon's character is charismatic, and Norton's is not - this has the effect of making the viewer want to strangle poor Damon for falling for Norton's bad ideas and dishonest practices time and again.

227,zbgee57,A tough flick to rate,7,18 April 2001,"This review contains some spoiler information. Rounders is basically the best movie to date (that I've seen) that deals with the topic of pro poker.  The score, the poker matches, the acting all draw you in.  No poker movie even comes close to the first scene with Mike and KGB.  Although not entirely accurate of a real brutality and skill involved in heads up Holdem match, the audience cannot possibly be expected to understand all the ins and outs of Holdem.  Very few people do.  However, an engaging heart wrenching loss is still conveyed when KGB casually tosses in a call and flips up those two red aces with absolutely no remorse.  Thus, although a little off form reality (Mike's rationale in the scene's narration is too simple and the statement ""I'm gonna go all in cause I don't think you got the spades basically announces Mike's hand to any doof at the table) the big poker scene essentially works.  The same applies for the second final one as well. The plot is quite predictable and there are some real problems like: the size of Mike's apartment, the professors loan, and the fact that Mike decides not to have sex with Petra (come on she's really hot).  However, these shortcomings don't detract the way the simple plot draws you in.  I mean after Mike lost that first big game I knew he would come back to win. Everybody does.  But I still felt the ups and downs of Mike's bankroll like it was my own money.  When worm cheats and they (Mike and Worm) lose all their money and get their asses kicked in that 20 40 game I was ready to go berserk.  I'm glad Mike gets rid of him.  And that's how good Norton is in this film.  He plays the part so well that (as intended) you just can't stand him.  The ending of the film is problematic to many but I think most people who see this film just don't get it.  The film does not suggest compulsive gambling to everyone.  However, for some people, it is a lifestyle and a productive, fulfilling one at that.  The top 200 poker players in the world are functional addicts.  They live well and enjoy every minute of their compulsive, non traditional lifestyle.  Mike is going to find out if he can be one of the big shots.  In my opinion, he's really not that good a card player and will probably go home from Vegas dead broke.  However, poker as the film states is a calling.  Mike hears his and goes for it.  Whether he makes it or not isn't relevant.  Poker excellence is a lifelong pursuit. All the greats go through tough times.  I think Mike is somewhat delusional (so you put one move on Chan, big deal) but I think the poker mindset he exposes to the audience is very true to life.  That idea is what makes Rounders an important film.  It gives a voice to pro poker players.  Most people think of them as worthless, parasitic, immoral scumbags but I think this film lets you know something of what they are really like.  Doing so is really much harder than one would think. Explaining poker in the course of 121 minutes is very very difficult. Nonetheless, you want to play cards and re-experience the rush that Rounders gives you after you watch the film.  Personal Note:  I'd like to thank whoever was involved with getting this film to theatres.  You have encouraged millions of suckers to play poker. Thank you Thank you Thank you !!!!!  Anyway, I give this movie a 7.  A tough task, well executed, but still more could be said.  Rounders' friendship plot (the relationship between Worm and Mike) is not really ground breaking.  So you tolerate an old friend to a point and then drop him.  Ok, big deal.  Neither is Mike's romance with Gretchen Mol.  I think She loves me, she loves me not, she loves me has been done before. I think the actual topic of poker and its dynamics is what makes the movie interesting and enjoyable.  In terms of poker movies it (I'll say it again to make my point crystal clear) is by far the best to attempt to tackle the subject.  Yet, at the same time, it is not a masterpiece by any means.",Rounders
228,CellarDoor420,The most accurate movie about real poker.,10,11 September 2001,"As an avid poker player for many years, I can honestly say that the poker ideas and strategies expressed in 'Rounders' are genuine. Although in poker circles the movie is known to have a few very minor technical poker flaws, it is still a great primer for any would-be poker player. The only negative thing about the movie is the focus on cheating. In my experience cheating is not a prominent part of the game and in a way the movie proves what can happen to cheaters. All in all I recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in poker. I give it a 10 out of 10. (although I am biased, I've seen it over 100 times).",Rounders
229,racker_sk,"A royal flush, well crafted and presented.",10,5 November 2002,"It's a relief to see a movie not simply designed to stun you with visual effects. The movie has a crisp plot and was well acted through and through (Malkovich at his best). Overall the film was a success because of a focused plot a brilliant cast and an involving story. I feel that any person who enjoys a good game of poker would enjoy this film, even though the general outcome is predicted without much effort. Without a confusing story it manages to include a unique and normally unexplored theme for a film and was well done. It had all necessary concepts such as some intrigue, suspense, romance, a climax and wavering situations provided by the trickster. In summary a worthwhile watch even if only once for the poker realism and entertainment.",Rounders

All I know is that I'm compelled to watch it again and again.  There are some great characters in this film; Worm, Teddy KGB, Grama.  And you really can't beat the last scene with John Malkovic.  Everytime I see it I always find myself pulling for Matt Damon to come out on top.",Rounders
231,piyushpie,Underrated? Not at all!!!,1,23 May 2012,"Having found a movie on poker that i hadn't already watched , i was pretty excited. But my excitement wasn't to last long. A few minutes into the movie, the impression you get of Mike Dermott (Matt Damon) is definitely not of someone who is a seasoned poker player, but of a nervous kid out there to lose all he has (it is remarkably amateurish the way he loses the last deal). Nine months later and you are introduced to a string of random events. A difficult girl friend , a reckless friend (Worm, Edward Norton) who does his best to get Mike into trouble, an old man who preaches about destiny choosing a man (starts off with his story for no apparent reason!!), Worm and Mike getting into trouble and everything that reeks of banality and commonplace. No effort has been made to make any element of the later part of the movie credible. Making $7000 on the first night seems a cakewalk, but $8000 in two more nights an impossible task for no apparent reason. Towards the end of the movie was the much awaited showdown, match with Teddy KGB (John Malkovich, only one who does his part well) but it turns out to be the nail in the coffin instead. You'd find more surprise and tension in a local club poker match than in this one. The cocksure hero is expected to win and he does without a glitch.The End. The disappointment the movie had caused was too much for me, and i wanted to read reviews by people who felt like i did, to vent my frustration. But to my even greater disappointment, the top 4 reviews out of 10 had 'Underrated' as the Subject. My Suggestion - Don't waste your time watching this no good movie if it is for the love of poker that you are considering it. Instead, go for Cincinnati Kid, Croupier or California Split if you haven't already.",Rounders
232,edge118,Rounders -- The Movie you never get sick of,10,11 September 2002,"Rounders is a movie that is based around the poker game, Texas Holdem. With a great cast including Matt Damon and Edward Norton, there is no surprise that this movie is a must see.  I saw it for the first time last year and since then I've watched it at least 20 times since then.  I definitely recommend this movie.  Two thumbs up!",Rounders

Some of the characters are entirely unnecessary to the story. Some of the behaviors are obvious plot points that an attentive audience would notice before the other characters do.  If every actor has their bad movie in their past, this is Edward Norton's bad movie. He shines in this basic cable flop.",Rounders

But, I'm gonna find out.""These are the last lines from Rounders, the best movie ever made about poker. Their meaning, in my opinion, is that everyone one with poker skills has chances to win WSOP. You just need to believe it and play really well.I absolutely enjoyed the movie and the actor's performances( Edward Norton just doesn't know how to play badly). One of my friend's recommended me this movie, and I can only say that I was delighted by it. I consider myself an intensive poker player (Texas Hold'em), as I spent some of my nights in front of my computer playing non-stop poker on the internet(Pokerstars especially). Knowing the game really well, played a big role in my opinion about this movie. Movie which, i think, expresses very good the feelings you experience playing one your own. The ones who played poker before watching the movie, most probably found themselves in some of Mike's situations and choices. I also like that in the movie, poker is not considered a game of luck, but a game of patience and real skills.So, if you are a poker player, just watch it. You'll love it. It's like a story where it is explained in an original manner how Texas Hold'em Poker is played or should be played. Tells you about Luck, Why Play It, Winning, Losing and most important .. How to get back on your feet and star all over again.. with nothing, except high poker skills. Even if you lose, there is always another hand. If you're not a poker player... you'll be after you'll watch this movie. Trust me.",Rounders
235,Dr_Loomis_Lives,Great Poker Movie,8,25 November 2003,"Rounders is an awesome movie for anyone that likes the game of poker.  If you don't know the rules to Texas Hold'em then you might have a problem picking up what's going on during the Showdown hands between Damon and Malkovich.  Norton does a great job playing the role of ""Worm"", who brings Damon into his problems on more than one occassion.  Bottom Line:  Good movie for anyone, Must-see for poker fans.",Rounders
236,djironarm,"If you like poker, you need to watch this",9,5 February 2020,"Many will probably watch this because of the celebrity names, such as Matt Damon and Edward Norton. But this movie will be mostly attractive to those who love poker, specifically Texas Hold Em. Regardless, I think the movie is very well done. However it may be a bit boring, or over-the-head for those who are not into poker. It's one of my favorite movies, but I give it 9/10 because there are couple scenes that are a little far-fetched. For example the ""judges game"" where he calls everyone's hand. This movie is mostly very realistic, unlike many poker movies, but that scene is not. They should have had him guess just one hand.",Rounders

238,cradleoffamily,A classic and pure masterpiece,10,4 August 2013,"I am not one for reviews but being this is my favorite movie of all-time I felt the need to give it my best shot. Matt Damon, in one of his best is just the 9 to 5 guy who is tired of 9 to 5, looking to fulfill his dreams of poker glory. He hits a bump in the road with fellow KGB mogul John Malkovich. Malkovich also like most of the cast nails his role. His old buddy Edward Norton AKA worm (go figure) is nothing but problems for Damon. I am not going to get into much more detail but I will say the movie was well written, full of great actors/actresses and is a hidden gem in the movie industry. The movies plot is based purely around the game of poker but can be remembered full of life lessons. never give up your dreams, be careful of those around you who do not make you a better person. And remember odds are no matter how successful you are in life there are people who have helped you get where you are.",Rounders
239,wenpetren,Underground Poker,8,16 May 2005,"This movie is a realistic account of underground poker games. This movie is as real as it gets without living the life of a poker player. The game is all Hollywood now and the matador (ESPN Show) is a fraud. The characters are well developed and very believable. Mike McD, Worm, Teddy KGB, and Kinish, these types of Characters are what makes movies worth watching. The last time I have seen character development was in ""Dead Solid Perfect"" and ""Swingers"". The plot also keeps your attention although predictable it has some minor twist and is very good. In my book this is the only poker movie worth watching. The last thing I have to say is that this is a guy's guy movie and can be watch over and over again.",Rounders

241,krmcclellan,Great Movie...Norton shines,10,18 April 2006,"This is a great movie that I think anyone who enjoys superb acting will like. I first saw this movie on television when I was about 14( I was 11 when it was first released in theaters), however I recently got interested in Edward Norton's other movies which include Fight Club and Primal Fear ( both great) So I rented the movie this weekend and I loved it( this is coming from someone who knows absolutely NOTHING about poker). The poker dialoge went a little over my head, but even I understood the gist of what was going on. Its the characters not the poker that makes this movie so good in my opinion. It starts out with Mike Mcdermont a young man with incredible card playing talent( Matt Damon) going to play Texas hold em with a Russian mobster named Teddy KGB ( played hilariously by one of my personal favorites John Malkovich). Mike losses 30,000 dollars, his rent money, case money, and tuition for law school. After such a bad beat he quits poker and goes to work for Joey Knish( a fellow card player who is Mikes friend and mentor) driving a delivery truck. Mike is doing good, going to school and making an honest living. That is until his best bud Lester ""Worm"" Murphy is released from prison. Mike goes to pick him up and Worm has Mike playing poker that very night, scamming some young trust fund babies. Worm is eager to start playing poker as soon as he gets out, and we find out that it is because he owes like 15,000 dollars to various loan sharks. Mike not wanting his friend to take a beating( which the scumnbag deserves) vouches for Worm and together they try to come up with the money. Worm ends up getting him and Mike in loads of trouble, leaving Mike to fend for himself Now like I said the characters are what makes this movie so great. Matt Damon is great as a young man who has dreams and wants to follow them(playing in the World Series of Poker). You truly believe his poker ability. Edward Norton is my personal favorite. Worm just lights up the screen.He has almost the same amount of true poker skills as Mike, but he prefers to cheat because he says it gives him an edge. Most people who see this movie hate the character( for good reason...he is cheap and slimy) but not me. I actually feel sorry for him not only because he gets the crap beat out of him sometimes but also because he has no direction unlike Mike. He has no idea what he wants to do with his life. I just wish he would have taken up for himself more. There is one scene when one of the loan sharks beats up Worm in the back room of a strip club. Now Worm is skinny yes, but skinny guys can fight too. The whole time he is being pushed around I am wanting to go through the television and tell him to throw a few punches too, fight back. Also it leaves you hanging at the end, Mike leaves Worm after they get beat up by some off duty cops that Worm was trying to scam. It never tells you what happened to Worm. Did he leave town? Did the loan sharks get to him? They spend a lot of the movie developing Worms story and then they just kind of leave it unfinished at the end. The one thing I didn't like was Mikes girlfriend Joe, can you say bitchy. She is two dimensional and needs to trust the man she supposdly loves. Othe then that great movie. I give it a 10.",Rounders
242,Eddie_Z,The realism is what counts,10,30 October 2005,"Far too often in movies involving sports, card games or other competition, you see far fetched scenarios play out. One of the things that I truly enjoyed about this movie, and probably the thing that put an already incredible movie over the top for me, is the realism of the way that things play out.Before I dig too deeply into that, allow me to say that everything about this movie was outstanding. Each actor captured their roles perfectly. In a movie that had so many name actors, you got the idea that they were all truly trying to work together to make each scene special rather than trying to upstage each other. Now I understand that Matt Damon and Edward Norton were still relatively young in their popularity when the movie came out but I believe that makes their unselfish performances even more noteworthy.Aside from the brilliant acting from the main characters right on down to the smallest bit player, the film has a seamless flow throughout. Every scene is meaningful and necessary to telling the story. At no time do you watch a scene and when it ends think to yourself that it didn't need to be in the movie. The transitions from scene to scene don't skip a beat. Each character is well defined.Getting back to my original point though, what truly put this movie over the top in my mind was the authenticity of what takes place. A straight flush and especially a royal flush are just not very common in the world of poker. In many Hollywood-ized films, one of these types of hands would be the end all to your film. It would be the type of hand that improbably highlights the hero scoring his ultimate victory. Things like this do not happen in Rounders. Common winning hands like flushes, straights and full houses are featured.Aside from that fact is the very realistic idea that many of the hands are not won because of what they are, but rather because of how they are played. People who are familiar with the game of Poker, Texas Hold Em in particular, understand the fact that this is so often the case. That is the icing on this wonderfully baked cinematic cake.Adding to the authenticity of the game is the lingo used by the card players. Watching the movie gives you a realistic feel of the banter used amongst avid card players and this gives yet another true feel to the movie.Don't be fooled though, my wife doesn't ever play cards and she (amongst many who don't play) enjoys the movie a great deal as well. The characters themselves are enough to hook you into the movie from start to finish. All-in-all, Rounders is an excellent film whether you are an avid poker nut like myself or somebody who just wants to see a great movie with an outstanding plot and beautifully developed characters.",Rounders

The acting is superb and the story is all to real to those of us that have been there. I cant begin to describe how often I watch this movie and how many of my poker playing friends agree that this is not only the best poker movie ever written, but also a great movie for non players as well. I think that the casting agent did a remarkable job....Matt and Edward play the parts of poker players to an eerie T. All to often a fictional portrayal of so called gamblers put us into a bad light, this film does us justice and shows that poker players have ambition,desire, and skill",Rounders
