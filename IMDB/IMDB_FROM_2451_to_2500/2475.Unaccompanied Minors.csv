0,SnoopyStyle,"Too childish, and without the poignancy of 'The Breakfast Club'",5,24 December 2013,"The airport is snowed in, and all flights are canceled. All the unaccompanied minors are rounded up and put in a locked room. Wilmer Valderrama tries and fails to control the rambunctious lot. Five kids (Tyler James Williams, Dyllan Christopher, Brett Kelly, Gia Mantegna, Quinn Shephard) escape and run rampant.The four main kid leads are perfectly likable with good chemistry. This could have been 'The Breakfast Club' lite. I think director Paul Feig is trying for that feeling. But the script doesn't have it. Lewis Black is way too outlandish as a villain. There is way too much childishness. Unlike 'The Breakfast Club', this doesn't have the insightfulness or the relevance. And bringing out 'The Kids in the Hall' make no difference at all. It could have been so much better.",Unaccompanied Minors
1,jboothmillard,Grounded,3,3 December 2010,"Described as Home Alone in an airport, this sounded like an easily digestible Christmas themed film, as it turned out, it was slightly difficult to swallow, you might easily choke on how lame it is. Basically six children, Spencer Davenport (Dyllan Christopher) with sister Katherine (Dominique Saldaña), Timothy 'Beef' Wellington (Brett Kelly), Charlie Goldfinch (Everybody Hates Chris's Tyler James Williams), Grace Conrad (Gina Mantegna) and Donna Malone (Quinn Shephard) have all arrived on Christmas Eve at the Midwestern Hoover International Airport. As unaccompanied minors they are made to wait in the UM room until further notice, but Spencer, Beef, Charlie, Grace and Donna escape with the start of a big squabble, and they explore the airport to wreak havoc. Eventually, after getting underage manicures, playing with emergency equipment, ordering and eating food without paying, messing in a toy shop, and destroying things, the children are caught. As punishment, airport boss Oliver Porter (Man of the Year's Lewis Black) says the five troublemakers are not allowed to go to the hotel provided as a result of being snowed in with no operational flights. With the not so effective Zach Van Bourke (Wilmer Valderrama) keeping an eye on them, it is easy for the kids to escape again, and while Beef goes in search for a Christmas for Spencer's sister Katherine, a big believer in Santa and the Christmas spirit, the rest stay in the airport. The four kids are hiding in the unclaimed luggage hold, opening bags and playing with the contents inside, and they are lucky to escape from Mr. Porter again, and Spencer to get a doll as a present for Katherine. Finding walkie talkies with video recorders, the kids escape and manage to get outside to sledge to the hotel where Katherine and other kids are being held, but Mr. Porter catches them on arrival. The four kids are placed in separate prison style rooms with the walkie-talkies handy to talk to, but also to record themselves on video to put over the camera and escape through the above vents. They drop into the room where all the Christmas decorations have been hidden, and Beef returns with a Christmas tree, so Spencer and the gang decide to decorate the airport with all the stuff. Mr. Porter does spot them in the act, but his heart is changed for the good, and meanwhile Spencer's environmental father Sam Davenport (Hot Tub Time Machine's Rob Corddry) is close to getting to them, despite some mishaps. In the end, Christmas Day, all the people in the airport wake up to decorations, Katherine's Christmas spirit is confirmed with a present and the arrival of Mr. Porter dressed as Santa, and all the kids promise to keep in touch. Also starring Paget Brewster as Valerie Davenport and Jessica Walter as Cindi. The critics got this right that this is more for the younger audience, the kids are typical Breakfast Club style characters that are mischievous and then touchy-feely, and it is filled with pretty tedious meant to be funny moments, a rather dull Christmas comedy.

2,Scarecrow-88,Unaccompanied Minors,5,7 December 2019,"Youths without parents are stranded, as other adults, at an airport on Christmas Eve. Lewis Black operates the airport, stuck as others at the airport, robbed of his vacation, looking to keep the kids either at a nearby lodge or at the UM room (basically a dreary, concrete-floored cell), and out of his hair. That doesn't go according to plan as frequent flying tech geek, Charlie Goodfinch (Tyler James Williams, always fainting at the sight of Santa for some reason and seemingly emotionally attached to ""womb-like"" enclosed spaces), AV Club nerd, Spencer Davenport (Dyllan Christopher), quiet, ""beefy"" Timothy (Brett Kelly; Bad Santa), boarding school lonely ""rich kid"", Grace (Gia Mantegna), and ""touchy"" attitudinal, Donna (Quinn Shephard) decide to leave the UM room and traverse the airport, raking up restaurant and massage/therapy bills, driving security cruisers, and intruding upon a security equipment room. Once corralled and returned to the UM room, Spencer realizes his blond sister, Katherine (Dominique Saldaña), has been taken to the lodge, determined to get to her and leave behind something from Santa so she won't be disappointed. That's it in a nutshell as Black and his security staff loses the kids, finds them, loses them, etc. The airport is the main setting with the lodge a visitor to the film on occasion as Valerie is tormented by a stewardess' (Jessica Walter) daughter (her braces seem to be a visual cue that she's unbearable), ""babysat"" while getting her hair braided and face painted with an overt makeup job. Nothing special, this might end up being a nostalgia trip for millennials and its holiday spirit heart is in the right place, so that might help. Black has to keep his usual potty-mouth PG so he's more or less a punching bag for disgruntled lodge customers, luggage in the floor, and trips down snowy landscape in a kayak...he does get the Scrooge redemption treatment as Spencer realizes after a calmer conversation at the end that he isn't a Christmas guy because of family strife. Wilmer Valderrama plays his character completely absent any silliness, Black's oft-mistreated lackey, stuck with the kids, losing them as well. He does help them at the end to find Valerie and does assist in providing all those stuck at the airport with a nice bit of Christmas cheer once the stockroom keeping all the seasonal stuff put up are freed, decorating primarily one area to get some smiles from many left inside during Christmas Day. I will say, my kids loved the film, maybe because it was like an adventure for the main youths loose in the airport, evading Black and his white-suited security staff (which included Kids in the Hall alums, playing musical chairs in boredom, and Rob Riggle, going to his tried and true adult idiot routine, often tripping or fumbling instead of successfully proving his employment was just), who often prove time and again that airport security hiring practices should be revised and improved. The youths are appealing enough, although they cause a lot of unneeded trouble to Black and his team. Such melodrama includes the Davenports' mom, Valerie (Paget Brewster) freaking out at her sister's obsessively Christmassy home (Teri Garr) and father (Rob Cordrry), in his bio-fuel car in Pennsylvania, trying to reach the airport and having to deny his clean/green philosophy by driving a fossil fuel consuming Humvee after a disastrous explosion involving diesel. A lot of familiar faces include The Office castmates, Mindy Kaling and BJ Novak, Tony Hale of Veep as a lonely holdover customer who gets a present from Santa, and Kristen Wiig (who I somehow missed). Chase scenes, vent escapes, camera illusions, and baggage claim (poor Charlie in a suitcase, endures quite a trip, flipped, tossed, and bounced quite a bit while inside) adventures ensue. I think this is mostly forgettable, and ultimately the plot is really thin, with little surprises to be had. Black tries, man, he does. Probably very limited in the audience that it will appeal to. The young actors, to their credit, aren't without their charms. Little couplings develop during their night/early morning journeys in the airport.",Unaccompanied Minors
3,Sylviastel,My mom's boyfriend says that Christmas is when Frosty the Snowman fights the devil.,7,10 July 2019,"This film might appeal to families and younger viewers. I didn't even know about it until I stumbled at the dollar store. It's a cute premise about kids who travel without their guardians or parents. They're stuck at Hoover Airport during a blizzard on Christmas Eve. Lewis Black has a starring role as a miserable pilot whose flight to Hawaii gets canceled. Wilmer Valderrama is good as the appointed temporary carer of two siblings, Spencer and Katherine. Their mother is back home with grandmother (played by Terri Garr). Their father must find a away to get to the airport. The airport was ill-equipped to handle so many children. It's like Lord of The Flies down there. The film has it's moments too. Brett Kelly who was awesome in ""Bad Santa"" played one of the kids here too.",Unaccompanied Minors
4,StevePulaski,The island of misfit minors,3,16 December 2012,"Unaccompanied Minors blows such a grand opportunity for a kids film, so much so that sticking around to the end is a chore because you see so many ways the film could've subverted its dead end cliché material and watching it stay gridlocked to cheap, disposable schlock of the least common denominator is painful to say the least. With the wealth of talent and directorial experience on recognizably professional TV shows, I would've expected director Paul Feig to give this film proper guidance into sustainable entertainment and not that of a facile nature.The film stars a wealth of talented youngsters that you hunger to see in better material. They are all ""unaccompanied minors,"" planing to fly alone to travel to one place or another for Christmas, when all the flights at the airport are unexpectedly grounded because of an enormous blizzard that has consumed the entire town. We first meet Spencer and Katherine Davenport (Dyllan Christopher and Dominique Saldaña), who are scheduled to fly to Pennsylvania to spend Christmas with their father, but are instead, transferred to the ominous U.M. room when their flight is cancelled.And what a room this ""U.M. room"" is. It's the most archaic sight in a kids' movie since watching Eddie Murphy, Jeff Garlin, and Steve Zahn get man-handled by a bunch of rugrats in Daddy Day Care. The room is crawling with about fifty or sixty ankle-biters, running lawlessly throughout the large, mundane room. The dopey but somewhat likable Zach Van Bourke (Wilmer Valderrama) is conned into watching the kids, but after he is tackled, several kids manage to escape and run wild in the airport. They are prettygirl Grace (Gina Mantegna), smart but overly-goofy Charlie (Tyler James Williams), sensitive Donna (Quinn Shephard), and the quiet Beef (Brett Kelly). They are captured by the head of passenger relations Oliver Porter (Lewis Black), and sent back to the ominous room, where the activity has died down since the remaining unaccompanied minors were taken to a quiet lodge for the night, but the six kids manage to sneak out once more, with Spencer desperately trying to get a doll delivered to his sister, who is now at the lodge.All the kids here are great and can be very effective in better material. We already know the capabilities of Brett Kelly, who was perfectly cast in Bad Santa, but here, he is made into the bumbling, mysterious fat kid, who we know even less about at the end of the film than at the beginning. Tyler James Williams of Everybody Hates Chris fame works well in his little role, but after a while, his character, much like he would in real life, becomes a pain to deal with. An nerdy, confused, quirky little albatross.We could think of these five kids as misfits and the airport as their island. This already poses an interesting setup. But, unfortunately, writers Jacob Meszaros and Mya Stark make the film nothing more than a collection of slapstick gags, and only incorporating the ideas of divorce, loneliness, and being an outcast as little minor character backstories the film chooses to do noting with. I believe that many, many kids would be more interested in watching kids go through and handle the same problems they possibly are going through rather than lumber around setups concocted from a fourth graders daydream.Starring: Dyllan Christopher, Dominique Saldaña, Tyler James Williams, Brett Kelly, Gina Mantegna, Quinn Shephard, Lewis Black, Wilmer Valderrama. Directed by: Paul Feig.",Unaccompanied Minors
5,MLDinTN,not sure why anyone over the age of 10...,3,24 December 2007,"would give this movie a good review. I was expecting much better after reading several positive reviews of this film. Maybe those reviews were posted by little kids, because I think that is the only audience that would enjoy this film. I found it silly and not really funny. Sure kids getting into trouble, making adults look foolish can be amusing, but it doesn't make a great film. Basically, the movie is about some kids, who are traveling alone, get stranded at an airport over Christmas. They are all put in this room where everyone is going wild. They escape and cause havoc all over the airport for the airport customer guy. In the end, they want to spread some Christmas joy for all the stranded passengers.FINAl VERDICT: Not funny. Maybe kids would like it, but skip it if you're over 12.",Unaccompanied Minors

7,DarkVulcan29,"It's Home Alone, The Terminal, and The Breakfast Club all rolled up into one.",8,17 December 2006,"This movie is every kids fantasy, and is every adults worst nightmare. This movie makes the kids the hero's, and most of the grown ups the villains. This movie takes place in an airport on Christmas Eve, where six kids are forced to stay over night, when there flight gets canceled due to bad weather, under the strict watch over airport manager Oliver Porter(The very funny Lewis Black), but these kids are not gonna sit still and be bored, they are gonna make this a Christmas to remember, by having fun and trying to outwit Mr. Porter and airport security.

9,aidanratesmovies,Kill me now!!!,1,9 November 2021,"A horrendously unfunny family Christmas comedy, Unaccompanied Minors is about as worse as it gets, with its only pros being a single good joke and being better than The Santa Clause 3...slightly. 2006, a year of debatably the worst Christmas movies ever made. Among the critically panned duds that were released this year was of course the previously mentioned Santa Clause 3, Deck the Halls, the 2006 Black Christmas remake, and this monstrosity. This film is so incredibly cringeworthy to watch at times that it actually hurt my soul. Never before have I seen such dreadful kid actors, and a film in such need for a decent screenplay. As horrible Santa Clause 3 was, at least it had a freaking plot, this film has almost nothing. And it's not just the kid actors that are horrendous throughout the film, but all of the adults as well, with extraordinarily bad performances from actors Rob Riggle, Lewis Black, Rob Corddry, and more. The film tries so hard to be funny all the time, and so hard to have any significant value, when it is incredibly clear they are all grasping at straws. The plot makes no sense, and the situations can be just cruel, it's a weird and twisted unfunny little kids flick that is bound to break the strongest of movie watchers- and I never want to see it again.My Rating: 1/10.",Unaccompanied Minors

13,barrys82,"a disappointing movie, avoid it at any cost",5,7 September 2007,"It was a decent movie nothing excellent but viewable. The story is based on real childhood experiences from writer Susan Burton, but it makes me very difficult to believe that a bunch of pre-teens do that kind of things. The plot was kinda weak and undeveloped. the cast has decent acting, all performances were good but the best one in my opinion comes from Tyler James Williams. Wilmer Valderrama's performance was so unconvincing and disappointing, its like watching him in his role of Fez but working in an airport and Lewis Black as the movie villain was good. In conclusion, this movie is dull but enjoyable to watch it on a boring weekend.",Unaccompanied Minors
14,ayoreinf,A nice surprise of a movie,7,29 December 2012,"It's not a masterpiece, it's not pretending it is, but it's fairly well written, with good characters for leads and the actors give their share, like good actors do when they're given good roles to act. It avoids almost entirely cartoonish characters, restricting them to the third or even fourth tiers. In fact the movie surprises with some unexpected depth at moments were a cheesy joke would've been easier. Very little slapstick, limited to specific scenes which call for some physical humor. And apart from some excess saccharine and cliché at moments, there's some solid story telling here, which I always appreciate. The two leading kids Gia (Gina) Mantegnia and Dylan Christopher got the looks and the talent to be going places if they just conduct themselves right. Lewis Black takes a cartoon villain and makes him human, and Paget Brewster and Teri Garr present some lovely background cartoons that complete a surprisingly nice movie.",Unaccompanied Minors
15,cosmic_quest,Strictly for under tens,3,6 January 2008,"I had the misfortune of catching 'Grounded' the other day and found it to be a rather pointless little film not worth the ninety minutes or so it takes to view it, and I'm usually lenient on Christmas films. The film revolves around five kids of divorced parents, aged between twelve and fifteen, who are travelling alone before Christmas to visit their other parent. When the airport in snowed in, they go on a rampage with predictable 'Home Alone'-style tricks and out-smarting of airport staff.I can't complain too much about the acting of the kids. It's nothing special but neither are they terrible, although it is only Tyler James Williams (better known as Chris, from the TV show 'Everybody Hates Chris') who stands out for his expressive ways and wide-eyed sweetness. The adult cast are forgettable since they barely make much of an appearance other than the brief scenes where they come across as inept losers in face of the kids' antics.'Grounded' fails, largely, because the five kids are far too old to be carrying on like the eight-year-olds they are depicted as nor is there much of a point to their unruly behaviour. They were locked up because they acted like brats and don't deserve to be portrayed as heroes we should all hail. At least, in 'Home Alone', Kevin was not only just eight but he was justified in his tricks because he was defending his home. The toilet humour and the dumbed down show of kids outsmarting big, stupid adults only added to why this film is aimed at undiscerning youngsters under the age of ten. What didn't help elevate the film was the way it portrayed divorced kids as being 'special' and somehow less well-off than children of married parents when there are many well-adjusted kids of divorced parents out there who would be offended by this idea.This film is pointless for anyone who's seen 'Home Alone', a superior Christmassy film about a kid trumping the adults. I can't see many folk past primary school-age who will find much interest in it.",Unaccompanied Minors

Just go into a McDonald's playplace. It'll give you much, much less of a headache.It's not funny. It's not cute. It's not clever. It's not entertaining. It's not realistic. It's just scene after scene of children misbehaving and causing non-stop chaos for no reason whatsoever. If I was there, I would've smacked every single one of these kids across the face. The one redeeming moment was when a security guard managed to get stuck in a tire and roll down a hill (it was hilarious, actually), but that's nowhere close to actual redemption. It does let up on the awfulness halfway through, but still. Too little, too late.Maybe adults should stop trying so hard to write child characters ... or try a little harder. Where's Stephen King when you need him?I get that this was meant for kids, but I refuse to let my children watch this dumpster fire.

22,editor-299,Silly Christmas diversion,3,5 December 2006,"Hey, I've seen this film before  it's called ""The Breakfast Club."" No, wait, that film was actually clever and funny. This rehash of every kid-left-alone movie has incredibly cute children, but very little laughs - and even with a schmaltzy ending - very little heart.Five kids from different parts of the country, normal kid Spencer (Dyllan Christopher), weakling Charlie (Tyler James'Williams), fat boy Timothy (Brett Kelly), spoiled princess Grace (Gina Mantenga) and tomboy Grace (Quinn Shephard), find themselves together at a Chicago airport.Put together in a dungeon-like basement for kids traveling without parents, they soon escape and make an effort to find Spencer's little sister, Katherine (Dominique Saldana).This takes place as grumpy security manager (comedian Lewis Black) and his three idiot guards (former Kids in the Hall players Kevin McDonald, Bruce McCulloch and Mark McKinney) pursue the indifferent and resourceful moppets.At least Black, whose acerbic tirades on ""The Daily Show"" can be hilarious; and his well-received books and stand-up specials draw much attention, is funnier here than he was in ""Man of the Year."" All the while, we are treated to unfunny sequences featuring Spencer and Katherine's moronic, tree-hugging dad, whose vegetable oil-burning vehicle explodes while he is driving to pick them up. Luckily, a chainsaw-toting redneck cretin provides the guy with a new Hummer for the rest of the trip.Still, this devolves into another ""the kids are really smart while the adults are idiots who end up completely defeated and befuddled in the end"" kind of movies. That was all right in ""Home Alone"" but it doesn't really work when you care nothing about any of these young characters.A sappy conclusion, featuring a reformed Black and the arrival of a deadbeat father, along with everyone getting a new girl/boyfriend (except the fat kid, because we know fat people in Hollywood films do not deserve any sort of happiness), adds to the overall stupidity.Saw several critics on the Internet Movie Data Base that actually gave 10 stars to this picture. Maybe ""Unaccompanied Minors"" is just as good as ""From Here To Eternity,"" ""On the Waterfront,"" ""The Godfather,"" ""The Grapes of Wrath,"" ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" ""West Side Story"" and ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" to these people, but I'm afraid I'll just have to drop the bar a star or two.",Unaccompanied Minors
23,slimer8489,Pure Nostalgia Overload!,7,12 February 2015,"OK, so on Facebook, I do reviews of forgotten movies/TV shows/books/etc. from my childhood on Throwback Thursday (I go above and beyond), and for Christmas, this was my choice, and it was the perfect choice! Usually on TBT, I have an amazing memory with the movies, but with this movie (since I was reviewing it for Christmas, which is a special time), I decided to check it out from the library, and watch it again, and I was hit with nostalgia.I like this movie. It reminds me of my childhood, when kids movies were just about kids being kids. I miss those days. It reminds me of the days when technological things like cell phones weren't advanced (yet) and all you had was a flip phone. Yeah, before technology controlled our damn lives! This movie is a kid's dream: Just kids trapped in an airport having the time of their lives.I really like the Spencer kid, and how he's so determined to get anything done. These kids have some great chemistry together. I'm also surprised that he has a really nice sister, unlike most things like this, where the sister is an annoying brat.But there are things that I don't like about this movie, like the scenes with Spencer's dad trying to get to his kids. They're not funny, and they drag on. There's no importance to them. I think they should have put these on the deleted scenes for the DVD. The guards aren't really funny, but other than that, I really like this movie.If you're an adult reading this and you're about to watch this, go into it with the mind of a child. Just have fun with this movie. Just think back to the days when you were a kid, just the days when kids weren't focused on stuff like relationships and instead, were focused on being kids.So, with that said, pop this DVD in if you have the chance, and prepare to feel like a kid again!

There are some very interesting moments here and I think that everyone else will probably agree with me.The picture is about a small group of kids who are traveling for the Christmas holiday. However, it all goes awry when a fierce snowstorm delays every flight at the airport. Of all the children that are present at this location five of them manage to wreak all sorts of havoc throughout the lounge and its surrounding areas. This infuriates the security manger, Oliver Porter, who is supposedly also in charge of everything else at the facility. The kids (Spencer, Grace, Beef, Donna, and Charlie) disobey every single command that Oliver gives them; they also manage to escape all the places that he chooses to confine them in. The kids eventually reach Spencer's sister Katherine and give her a present so she won't think that Santa forgot about her. The five kids establish a very strong bond at the end of the film.Unaccompanied Minors is very entertaining. I recommend this movie to everyone that I know. See it, this is guaranteed to mesmerize you.",Unaccompanied Minors
27,expe67,great movie,8,17 December 2011,"i just saw this movie.and as Christmas is one week ahead ,this movie made me glad and had all the good feelings together with clever stylish adventure and kids being intelligent.made me want to be in their group.no one is really bad in this movie,it did not have any ""bad"" characters or scenes unlike some other family movies.it was a very warm and entertaining movie.the acting was pretty good.the rhythm was proper ,not very fast ,but neither boring,keeping you happy and curious.it makes you see an airport through a child's eyes.i did not see much difference between this movie and the mega-classic home alone,except the star quality of macaulay culkin.but guess what.these kids are very likable without really trying to be,which is a great approach.all together i recommend this movie especially during the Christmas period for everyone young or old who can still feel like a little kid trying to have fun.",Unaccompanied Minors
28,imdb1,Nice feel-good movie,6,5 April 2007,"I just watched this movie and I really don't understand why people think this is a horrible movie. It's a good movie, I really enjoyed it! Sure, there isn't some complex plot with several twists; it's just a relaxed ride, a feel good movie. It's un-complex. As un-complex as children ARE. You remember how good live was when you were young? No worries (well, for most people that's true anyway ;). The things the kids in this movie do are things that you CAN only do when you are still young: the adults are going to forgive you. They are doing things that no adult could ever get away with, but that is exactly why it made me feel good: you just know that there won't be consequences; it's just pure adventure and fun.I see a lot of B-movies lately; were the acting is REALLY REALLY bad. The kind of movies that I turn off half way, disgusted that I wasted my time with it. Imho, THAT are the kind of movies that should fill up the bottom 250 on IMDb. The acting in this movie however, is good! The kids put down some professional acting (not perfect, but in most cases that is totally to blame on the director-- the movie doesn't need it either, this isn't a ""The Good Son (1993)"") and the adults act as adults typically act in kids movies, nothing that annoyed me.I think that any adult can enjoy this movie, if they keep an open mind, like children and still are enough of a kid in their heart to remember how (good) it was in their childhood.Don't expect anything deep - just sit back and allow yourself to enjoy a while without worries.",Unaccompanied Minors
29,alan_v35,one is too high a rating,1,12 September 2007,"I am a fun-loving guy. I like to laugh, hear jokes and stuff like that. This is why I often like to see a comedy  even if its bad, it will give me a chuckle or two. Even those aimed at younger viewers are always good for a giggle, or at least a guffaw. Well, not always, I guess. This Home Alone wannabe is as funny as blood on the sidewalk. It has poor acting, a yawner of a story, jokes that are not funny, and a fine selection of stock characters that have been so overused by Hollywood, that the whole movie is as appealing as a commercial that you have seen six times in the last hour. If I have been a little wordy, and unclear, up to this point, let me say succinctly. This movie sucks.The premise here is that six youngsters, ranging in age from around seven to 14, are flying as unaccompanied minors, when a blizzard strands them at some airport somewhere, where they promptly set out on a mission of mischief that uses a lot of unfunny ideas and drab comic violence (particularly voice changing groin strikes  those are ALWAYS funny, right?) mixed in with toilet humor (Ingenious! Who would have thought of that?). There is an evil airport manager or something, who's as pleasant as an evening alone with an electric cattle prod and a mentally, deranged convict named Sparky. Now, that's not as fun as it sounds (never mind how I know!) bu it would probably still make a better movie than this one. I could go on, but I think I have made my point.It starts bad and it gets worse. It's not interesting and it's not funny. The only possible positive aspect to watching this might be a new appreciation for the value of every moment of the precious gift called life.

But that's pretty much what it is a new age Goonies. There was supposed to be a sequel or rather a new generation of Goonies made some time ago I don't know what happened to THAT project but after seeing this movie I came to the realization that that's what they pretty much did here. A family friendly Christmas centered Goonies...well not exactly its not all that innocent you see but looking back on it were the Goonies really all THAT innocent? As far as the kids' acting goes I don't know I guess that's up for grabs for some viewers its convincing for others not so much. I fall into the first camp. You can agree with me or not I don't car no skin off my back. Just don't expect Home Alone so much. The Goonies also did their fair share of Adult bashing if memory serves me right. This is just the next generation of that. Oh and the love stories were there too and a fart joke was in the Goonies as well but it wasn't scripted it just happened. So thee you have it. Oh and a sliding scene was there as well and a bathroom scene. Did I forget anything oh yeah chunky the fart kid was there as well. Parents reuniting with their children? check. Some evil adults trying to catch them check! The kids stumbling on to treasure? check. Yeah I'd recommend The Goonies if you like this movie you won't be dissatisfied its more of the same if not better. This was a alright this was a good movie. Enjoyable not as bad as the critics made it out to be. But you know critics anything else other than their vantage always makes something else look like Shakespeare..like they all appreciate him or something, LMAO.

35,FrostyHornyPie,"Hey, hey, this isn't a bad movie at all",5,21 December 2006,"Well, I do give it a medium rating...not bad and not good, but if adults park their brains outside the theater before going in, they'll find it fun. Sure, you have to overlook the way the kids are smarter than the adults and the fact that firstly the security guards aren't bright enough to be working airport security and even so aren't villains but just guys trying to do their jobs. Anyway, the acting is good and the script isn't bad if you don't think too hard about it. The movie is after all targeted for a junior high level audience, but the filmmakers are skillful enough to make it enjoyable for older viewers. Sure it's a reworking and multiplication of the Home Alone theme and Christmas setting. As other reviewers mentioned, there are echos also of The Breakfast Club and The Terminal. However, it's fluffy, harmless fun and there are worse movies out there right now. BTW, how did this get down to #2 on the worst list when Deck The Halls which isn't half as good is out there?",Unaccompanied Minors
36,movietelevision,One of my favorite Christmas movies,10,23 August 2009,"Elf, A Christmas Story, and Unaccompanied Minors. This is easily on of my favorite Christmas movies of all time. It's a funny, family-orientated, and feel good Christmas movie. The film revolves around four kids stuck in an airport on Christmas Eve. They get into crazy antics during their stay. Sort of juvenile but that's one of the reasons I love it so much. Some may argue this movie is only for the younger crowd. Being out of that crowd for a while, I disagree. I enjoy this movie very much. If you are looking for a movie to get you in the Christmas mood, or just to have a good laugh, then this is the movie for you. A great family holiday film I highly recommend.",Unaccompanied Minors
37,designing-digital,"Cute, better than expected",7,27 December 2006,"This was so much better than expected. The boy who played Charlie was excellent. I hope to see him in more movies. The story was mostly fun to watch as the kids decided to take their misfortune of being left with a room full of a bunch of crazy, undisciplined children of divorced parents. When seeing this it will make you think twice about leaving your kids fate in the hands of an airline. Right after I saw this movie a real life unaccompanied minor called his parents from the airport after walking unsupervised from the airplane into the airport. The airport director is a scrooge, he won't allow any Christmas decorations at the airport. Charlie, gets separated from his little sister and decides she will get a the Christmas gift she wants, even though they are far from home. With the help of his new friends, they set out on a mission to reunite Charlie with his sister. The characters are all from different backgrounds, but they have chemistry. The child actors are excellent and shine in this movie. I think some of the extreme scenes, like the one in the 'unaccompanied minor room' is to entertain younger audiences, but wasn't so ridiculous to lose older ones like me! Go see this with your kids! You won't be disappointed.",Unaccompanied Minors
38,Jane_Deaux,Seemed a little childish...,4,6 December 2006,"You should know that I had decided I'd rather watch ""Minors"" than ""Santa Clause 3"" or ""Deck the Halls,"" so going into the movie I was probably more lenient with it than I might have otherwise been...But anyway, I saw this and I thought it was okay. It reminded me a little of Home Alone with more kids and antics. I thought the four main kids--the ones stuck in the airport--had good chemistry and went well together. The adults (Black, Valderrama), while they've done okay in other movies/shows, seemed to be ""acting down."" In fact, the whole movie kind of seemed that way.These kids must be 13 or 14 but they're acting more like eight or nine. I'm sure it was as the director wanted but even the adults were talking slow and using lots of animated hand gestures. At the very beginning of the movie, one girl sits on a young, hip Santa's lap and tells him he ""hot"" and then the rest of the movie has the exaggerated and childish feeling of an episode of Blue's Clues. But, since I was ready to watch and enjoy this movie, I laughed at all the falling down, food-throwing, name-calling activity.I noticed a theme. I think this theme or message is what some parents will like about the movie and what some might decide to steer clear of: children of divorce do well on their own, perhaps even better than kids whose parents are still married. My parents divorced when I was 14 and I don't really feel like it had a huge impact on my life but today's kids are... different. Maybe ""divorce kids"" will enjoy this divorce kid fantasy more than everyone else. Parents will approve of it because, even with the happy ending, the divorced parents in the film were still divorced in the end.",Unaccompanied Minors
39,Pioneer75,"Give It A Chance, You Might Smile",5,2 August 2007,"Plot Summary: Due to a weather storm, an airport gets shut down on Christmas Eve/Christmas, stranding everyone there. All the kids get tossed into a room when our main character kids decide to bust out, leaving trouble in their wake. As punishment, they're isolated yet manage to escape several times in an attempt to bring Christmas to others, among other things.Review: The acting is a bit lacking at points, and its full of clichés and overused schticks, but it still turned out alright. Quite honestly, I was bored out of my mind the first 15-20 minutes, which felt like half the movie should have been over already. But it really turned around past that. Its got a lot of slapstick comedy and should be enjoyable for the family, providing laughs and a pretty feel-good ending.Overall: OK, so this movie's not gonna win any awards. But I didn't see why it's rated so low here. Maybe once the DVD hits shelves, people will realize its not all that bad of a movie. No one was expecting the ""Citizen Kane"" of kids movies here, so if you just want to see some funny stuff and have some laughs, you might actually be satisfied with the movie ""Unaccompanied Minors.""",Unaccompanied Minors

How ever I was skeptical about how this film would play out, and if It would be like another ones like ""Christmas with the Kranks."" I was surprised at how funny this actually was, It had the perfect combination of adult humor and child humor which made it enjoyable for me. To those who feel that this film sucks, don't watch it to seriously. Its just supposed to be fun, so enjoy it. I'd recommend this film to almost any one, although it looks stupid its a fun and enjoyable watch. All in all I give Unaccompanied Minors a 4/5 or a 8/10 for IMDb's Sake.

Lewis Black was also funny as the airport manager who doesn't like kids or Christmas.It reminded me some of ""Home Alone"". If you want serious, see something else.

42,wryanmcse2,Excellent family fun!,8,9 December 2006,"I didn't have high expectations of this movie going in but was surprised to find out how much I enjoyed it. There was humor for both my 12 year old son and his friend, as well as for myself and my wife. It was a bit like a teenager version of home alone, yet better, more grown-up basically to appeal to more than young kids. Yet it also had enough slapstick to entertain the very young children in the audience. A nice plus is that it didn't contain any language inappropriate, inappropriate sexual scenes/innuendo and the ending message was family friendly and pro-Christmas.For the adults there was some humor that went over the heads of my kids, I especially loved the scenes with the main characters eco-conscious father on his way to the airport. We'll definitely be getting the DVD when it comes out. Tyler James Williams (as Charlie) was absolutely hilarious and had the entire audience laughing hysterically. I recommend this to anyone with kids.My one caution would be that I was always hesitant with my own child, when he was much younger, to expose him to movies where, as in this case, it's implied that Santa isn't real. Since one of the major tasks for the kids in the movie is to prevent one of their younger siblings from being disappointed Christmas morning by not having received a present from Santa.",Unaccompanied Minors

Now my comments.The writing and promos did this movie no favors. When I first saw the promos I thought it was nothing but a movie about teen wrecking things and making the adults look like fools. Well, I was wrong. Unaccompanied Minors, which started off slow and predictable really picked up in the last 45 mins. Or as soon as the Kids ran from the guards and all end up on the luggage cart to escape. To me, this is where the movie picked up and became very enjoyable to the end.I say the best performances in Unaccompanied Minors, easily goes to the kids who plays Charlie and Donna. Not saying the rest sucks, but those 2 were quite good and made the film enjoyable. I so wanted more scenes of them because they had great chemistry and loved how they hook up in the end.There many scenes that are cringe-worthy but there also many scenes that are LOL funny and I was surprised that I found myself laughing at them.The movie is splatter with many cameos to name a few; The couple from The Office(Kelley and Ryan), Arrest Development(Buster and the mother), the hippy dude from Ned Declassified, and Terri Garr.

So had low expectations which may have helped set me up for a pleasant surprise. The kids except one or two seem(ed) unfamiliar but all were quite good, and the large number of rather famous adults (maybe more so now then in 2007?) were entertaining surprises as opposed to jarring distractions for the most part. And I thought the movie had a low key kind of realism(?) coupled with a rather kinetic visual style that gave the main part of the film a driving energy. I laughed a few times out loud and thought the movie hit all the right notes and few if any wrong notes. Certainly a little crazier than Hallmark/Ion/Lifetime Holiday fare but slightly less than Christmas Vacation (though some similarities exist!). Very good, relatively light hearted -kid centered- Christmas story.",Unaccompanied Minors

Oh and who cares if some things don't make sense you shouldn't care about if it makes sense you care about how funny it is and most of you are loser.

It does a good job reflecting the current culture in families (divorces and how they affect kids) and shows vividly the gap often between kids and adults.

The target audience is obviously of a younger age -- it's pretty much in the title. I'm in my late teens and thoroughly enjoyed this film. It doesn't make sense why such a good movie would be rated at the Bottom 100. If you discredit my review just because of my age, and believe all the negative reviews, you're missing out on an altogether sweet movie.The actors and actresses were great in their roles. I loved Spencer's dad and that whole thing with the cars! One of my favourite lines from the movie is when Mr.Porter says, ""Who trained you kids, the Navy Seals?!""

I recommend that the adults watch it without being too critical. Watch it realizing that it is a kids movie and ignore some of the cheesy lines. If you do that, then you will enjoy it and have some good laughs.When the movie starts, you are thrown right into the plot. There is little character development in the beginning. The introduction to the plot is also weak. The plot isn't deep and there are a few plot holes. Also, a lot of the comedy is physical comedy. The child actors did fairly well. Tyler James Williams, who plays in ""Everybody Hates Chris"" does really well with his role. His performance in the movie was the best performance of the child actors.

I believe if it wasn't for Lewis Black, this wouldn't have taken off. Definitely a generational film. One good item that wasn't carried over was the excessive drug use and references and of course language. This made for U.M. to be a much more enjoyable film.

It was directed by Paul Fig. I thought this movie was excellent. I think the effect it will have on it's viewers is them literally rolling on the floor laughing! I think the characters were believable. What makes then seem so real are the way they react to getting caught multiple times. They way they try to escape. And the way Spencer tries to let his sister have a nice Christmas because they're locked in an airport. The setting of the movie was in an airport. Of course the setting seems believable. I mean there is such a thing as the airport isn't there? The setting is Important to the plot because if they weren't there.. this movie probably never would have happened! The plot was hilarious! Yeah the plot does seem possible. There were actually a lot of surprises in this movie. I don't want to tell you any though because it could ruin the movie. One technique I really liked in this movie is that it involves kids trapped in an airport. The writers kept me interested as the movie played through because it could truly happen and the plot was just hilarious. I could relate to it in a weird way I think the effect this movie would have on viewers is if you're ever going somewhere on unaccompanied and you get snowed in. Make the best of it. If you try to see the best in things and have fun.. you'll probably have more fun than where you were going.I think the main message in this movie is, if something goes wrong, make the best of it. Like the kids did in this movie. The main characters were Spencer, Beef, Charlie, Grace, and Donna. The setting was in an airport.

The scene in the unclaimed baggage room with Tyler James Williams is priceless. He does steal some of the scenes in this movie, and probably has the best character.

I had to look who was playing the part up (Fez has gotten larger since the 70's, lol). The Kid's were cute at times and the gags were sometimes funny. The 'Chase Scenes' are way overdone (the sled scene in particular). There's a few insider cool scenes with The Kids In The Hall crew, but they are brief and few.

Later on I was invited to a private screening and I was skeptical as to whether it was worth my time or not. I decided to go, out of boredom (Monday night = nothing). So walking into this movie with absolutely no positive expectations, I was surprised.First off, this is a kid's movie. Actors are kids, theme is about kids, crazy chases involving kids, etc etc. However, I was pleasantly surprised at the subtle adult humor within the movie. I'm not saying there was anything explicit, but one scene for example had a security guard singing the theme song of a classic toy that only adults would know. It was content like this and the inclusion of Brett Kelly that made this movie for me. (If you haven't seen Bad Santa, I suggest you do before you see this movie) I see a lot of critics already shoving this movie into the ground; 40 year-old adults that are dissing a movie about and made for kids. The way I see this movie is that the kids want to see it, and the parents, expecting nothing, will laugh out loud. A lot of the themes and ideas aren't too complex within the movie, but it is for the kid's to understand, is it not? Overall this movie was a nice little surprise for me. The actors they picked were perfect (maybe not Wilmer, but anyone lesser-known may not do). The subtle adult based humor was good, and there were a couple of scenes that just made me crack up in my seat.When you go see this movie don't expect anything, don't take into account anything I said. A good thing to do would be to bring your kids, it's their movie anyhow. This review is just to get you to buy a ticket; after that open your mind and pretend like you saw the poster for the very first time.",Unaccompanied Minors
58,teh_real_sugar_baby,Lawl! Luv it!,10,18 December 2006,"I absolutely LOVED this movie!!! I definitely give it two thumbs up! It was super funny, and the best movie I've seen a long time! The plot was great. Trapped in an airport on Christmas Eve without your parents, with like a bazillion kids? That would be SO much fun! Seriously!I have to say my favorite character was Donna. She's so cool. ^^ Charlie was awesome, too. I think they look so cute together. I loved at the end when Donna kissed him, and he was all, ""Man, you're hot."" Her reactions funny, too. ""Yeah, I know."" I mean come on! For her tomboy, tough girl, character? That's hilarious!I think Spencer was a little bit too much of your classic main character, but good all the same. Grace was really funny, though! I really like when she gets aught in the spa. That's really funny. Spencer's sister is also really cute! I love the way she talks. ^^ Zach was also really cool! And ""Beef""s cool too! ^^The beginning really cool. I think them all going to see Santa gave a great introduction to their characters. I especially liked Grace's. SO SO funny!I definitely recommend this to everyone who's not a loser boring person who can't understand the greatness of funny movies. ^^",Unaccompanied Minors
59,hjn9494,One of the Best Films Ever,10,1 January 2007,"I wanted to see the movie since a couple of days after it came out. I went to go see it, and i have to admit, it is one of the funniest movies, I have ever seen. The film relates to the 1990 film ""Home Alone."" The script in my opinion is hilarious, and the actors do a good job of acting it out. It's a mixture of comedy and family. The plans and plots used in this film is clever, and each actor acts out his or her own part. I don't think they should make a sequel to this or anything, but it is worth your money if you're going to see it in theaters. I might even get this film on DVD maybe. If you're looking for a family film, Unaccompanied Minors is one of the best family films you will probably ever see.",Unaccompanied Minors
60,gary_dudenko,Not a bad movie at all!,9,12 August 2007,"I saw this movie, and I really liked it a lot. It wasn't only funny, but it was entertaining. Maybe for like 40 year-olds it may seem like a waste of time, but kids under the age of 12 will probably love this movie. I'm not really a family movie fan, (some of my favorite movies are Rob Zombie's ""The Devil's Rejects"", Cannibal Holocaust, Alpha Dog, Sin City...etc.) but this movie I liked so much that right after watching it, I saw it again. That's how much I liked it. It made me look at airports in a whole different way! It's a great movie to watch with the family, or with some friends, but it may not seen so great if you watch it alone, it is about Christmas, and no one should be alone on Christmas. I liked it not for the hilarious comedy, but for the storyline, it was great overall, any way you look at it.I strongly recommend people see it, especially on Christmas.",Unaccompanied Minors
61,golfnut801,Bad script + bad acting= One Bad Film!,1,13 December 2006,"I was excited to see this film, seeing it was filmed in Utah. To me watching for places I was familiar with was more interesting than the film itself. The only laugh from me was the Kids In the Hall Cameo playing musical chairsthat sadly was my only laugh. Oh and there was one fairly funny site gag. The kids that were in front of me was so bored they left early in the film. Saying that, this film is super bad, awful and very disappointing. This film is a huge waste of some really funny actors. The script is horrible; the kids are annoying and really not believable. Lewis Black is one of the funniest people alive and does not have a single funny moment in the film. Simply put, see something else.",Unaccompanied Minors
62,beckyrps,We just saw it -- my kids loved it,7,2 December 2006,"I had low expectations for this movie based on the trailer, but was pleasantly surprised. My kids loved it and it does have some good messages, such as an older brother who genuinely cares about his little sister, racial harmony, and a truly happy ending. Apparently the movie was based on a ""This American Life"" incident in which some children who were traveling without adults were stranded in an airport during Christmas because of bad weather. To avoid the horrible ""unaccompanied minors"" room they lead the officious airport authority on a chase through the airport. The PG rating is apt -- it's not G but has very few objectionable parts. I wouldn't pay full price to see it but it's worth the price of twilight admission.",Unaccompanied Minors
63,mysterylover3591,My kids liked it,5,30 December 2006,"I gave this movie a 5, which is a compromise. There were a few smiles in it, but mostly not such a great plot - but my kids, 11 and 14, enjoyed it, the 11 year old the most. If I were making the decision for myself alone, I wouldn't watch it until it came on TV, but it was worth it for a couple hours of enjoyment for the kids. The acting by the child actors was surprisingly good; it was the story that was not well-developed. I guess I should have realized that it wasn't that great when I discovered that it was located in the smallest theater in the multiplex! Overall, I'm sorry I spent over $17.00 to get us all in, but somewhat mollified by the fact that my daughter laughed out loud, repeatedly.",Unaccompanied Minors
64,MattTyler,"Just As expected, and more!",10,9 December 2006,"Well I went into the theater a fan of this movie and new what to expect. The kids get trapped in an Airport on Christmas Eve. Five of them escape and run a muck and the others 50 get to go to the lodge. The main point is the kids (Donna, Charli, Beef, Spencer and the rich chick) have to get to Spencers sister and like save Christmas.Actors: Quinn Shephard stole the show and brought the movie up a lot! She was genius and did a cute diddy with Charlie. I'll enjoy more of her work. Spencer and Beef played great roles and only a few times looked amateur at acting. Charlie and the rich girl were great acting skills and were flawless.The whole way the movie ran was amazing and ended great. Beef getting to tell his story, Donna kissing Charlie!! Spencer and the rich girl spending Christma together. Though some parts seemed pointless and unrealistic yet funny the movie ran great and is a keeper.Flaws weren't great in this movie because it was a kids movie an Christmas.",Unaccompanied Minors
65,TurboFan1961,Horrible....just horrible,1,30 December 2006,"I took my eleven year old daughter to see this movie after Christmas. We had seen the very short trailer on TV commercials, and she thought it looked funny, so we gave it a shot. I've never been so bored by a film in my life. The story was so loosely strung together, it was almost like they made it up along the way. The big selling point of this one was that it starred that Hispanic guy from ""That Seventies Show"" but he had such a small insignificant roll, I wonder why he even bothered. The African-American boy was hilarious in his roll, but it wasn't because they gave him funny lines to deliver, but purely his facial expressions while delivering them. I hope this kid gets many more rolls, he's great. I just hope that future casting directors will have the patience to watch this film to see how incredibly talented he is. I asked my daughter at the end of the film what she thought, and she said, ""It was really dumb, Mom. We should have seen Charlotte's Web, instead."" I suppose we would have rented this one after it came out on video - we usually rent most family movies to check out good ones to buy and have in our library - now at least I won't have to waste another dime to do that. By the way - the ""mentally challenged"" group of young men sitting in front of us in the theater seemed to enjoy this film. Perhaps that should be a clue.",Unaccompanied Minors
