0,MartinHafer,More puking and decapitating than I've seen in a long time! Just turn off your brain and enjoy.,3,17 June 2015,"""Machete"" is not a good film...nor does it even try to be. It's a film with insanely cartoon-like violence, it's extremely sexist, ridiculously one- dimensional characters and a main character that makes Rambo look like Gandhi!! It clearly is a guilty pleasure...but for the right person, it's a lot of fun. Sick, disgusting and creepy fun...but fun nevertheless.I should first point out that I saw this movie on the FX channel. While these folks have practically no standards whatsoever based on what they generally show, I also believe that they must have trimmed the film in order to show it. Any sex was likely excised...though the violence sure seemed to all be there! Yep...heads were flying right and left, guys were vomiting in close-ups, folks were getting stabbed in the eye with stiletto heels and they went through more blood to make this film than the entire Battle of the Bulge--all on FX! So, if it WAS edited, I would have to see what they found as too offensive!!Danny Trejo plays Machete--an ex-Mexican police officer who was left for dead by a soft-speaking Dracula-like baddie (Steven Seagal). Why leave your worst enemy and killing machine like Machete alive once you've captured him--especially after he slaughtered most of your evil minions? Well, how else can Machete star in the film considering that this is all in the first few minutes of the movie!!Years pass. There is an evil senator (Robert De Niro) who is on a campaign to kill illegal Mexican aliens. And, there is the drug lord (Seagal). How and why do they and their lackeys somehow work together and how does Machete figure into all this? And, how does a hottie US government agent who wears stiletto heels (Jessica Alba) get teamed up with Machete? See the film if you are curious. The bottom line is that practically none of the plot makes any sense, the characters are pretty stupid and one-dimensional and the film seems like just an excuse to allow one atrocity after another to be put on the screen. But despite its dumbness, it's also funny- -in a sick, violent sort of way. You cannot help but laugh at its excess and Trejo's performance is fun as well--even though NO ONE is so tough that they can take on groups of armed gunmen again and again armed only with a machete!! Ridiculous...but clearly a film that never takes itself seriously in the least. It never tries to be much other than a guilty pleasure.By the way, the film has a zillion surprising appearances by actors who you wouldn't expect in such an exploitation picture--such as De Niro, Don Johnson and many others. As for Lindsey Lohan...she is one you'd expect to see in such a film. My daughter summed it up well by saying ""it has so many cameos that it's like a Muppet movie...but with a lot more killing!"". Couldn't have summed it up much better myself! I would have just said it was stylish and stupid--and the last 10 minutes of the film perhaps the stoopidest in film history!!",Machete
1,Leofwine_draca,Danny Trejo finally gets the recognition he deserves,6,28 May 2011,"When the Tarantino/Rodriguez double-film collaboration GRINDHOUSE came out, it included with it a handful of fake trailers specifically made to hearken back to grindhouse cinema of old. The most notable trailer of the bunch was for MACHETE, a hilariously high octane action-thrill ride starring everyone's favourite Hispanic hero, Danny Trejo. The trailer was so well received that it was inevitable that a subsequent film would eventually follow, and when the real trailer for the film came out I thought it looked pretty good, as full of over the top nonsense as I was hoping. It was inevitable that no real movie could live up to that initial promise.MACHETE is, at the end of it, a B-movie featuring an unusually familiar cast. At its worst it feels like a case of join-the-dots film-making, as the gaps between the decent bits in the trailer are full of poor plotting and a fairly uninvolving, repetitive storyline. In certain instances, like when the film turns into a political commentary on the plight of illegal aliens, you feel that it's overstretching itself and forgetting what it's all about. The base line is this: MACHETE is a typical action vehicle, a revenge-fuelled odyssey of revenge and violence, all shot through with an old-fashioned sensibility.The low budget is often stretched and my biggest disappointment was the lack of any real bite or grittiness. Despite the outrageous violence of the fight sequences, they feel like something out of a comic book rather than a lean '70s-era thriller. Yes, watching Trejo beat the hell out of any villain who gets close to him is a joy, but the stretches between such moments are routine, leaving us waiting for the next one to come along. All the good bits were shown in the trailer, leaving this devoid of anything approaching surprise or excitement. Rodriguez shares directing credits with an unfamiliar name, making you wonder whether he did all the juicy bits and left the boring plotting to somebody else.Still, I'm sure that rewatches will prove more enjoyable, given that my unfairly high expectations have now been dashed. The film is schlocky and amusing, and makes fine use of a hard-to-beat cast. Along with the excellent Trejo, a man who's been crying out for a vehicle like this his entire career, we're treated to fun turns from the likes of Robert De Niro, Don Johnson, Cheech Marin, Lindsay Lohan, Tom Savini and Michelle Rodriguez as various allies/adversaries; Steven Seagal shows up to memorable effect, playing a villain for the first time in his career, and Jeff Fahey is as superbly slimy and ruthless as he was in the original fake trailer all those years ago. Only Jessica Alba lets the side down with a completely hopeless, embarrassingly out of her depth turn. The action and effects, when they come, are splendidly squidgy and it's hard to dislike a film with this much enthusiasm, so MACHETE has the potential to become a cult favourite in years to come.",Machete
2,SnoopyStyle,Robert Rodriguez's Mexploitation,6,8 March 2014,"Machete Cortez (Danny Trejo) was a Mexican Federale who just can't be bought. Crime lord Rogelio Torrez (Steven Seagal) captures him and kills his wife. It's three years later, Federal agent Sartana (Jessica Alba) is investigating a taco truck run by Luz (Michelle Rodriguez) suspected of being part of an underground network. She sees newcomer Machete hanging around. Meanwhile, State Senator John McLaughlin (Robert De Niro) and Von Jackson (Don Johnson) are hard-core anti-illegals vigilantes. Michael Booth (Jeff Fahey) wants Machete to kill McLaughlin and contracts him for $150k.Robert Rodriguez is making this in the vane of grindhouse cinema. It regales in some blood splattering violence and B-movie sexploitation. Danny Trejo is good in this role. He's a serious bad A, and this character has some serious dark edges. The plot is a mess, but that doesn't really diminish it that much. The fact Rodriguez got Lindsay Lohan to do real work should be commended. But I wouldn't give it anything higher than a 6/10.",Machete
3,Prismark10,Border patrol,6,4 September 2015,"Spun off from a fake trailer in Grindhouse. Danny Trejo is Machete, a former law enforcement agent but now an illegal immigrant and a vagrant in Texas some years after a drug lord Torrez (Steven Seagal) killed his family.A businessman named Booth (Jeff Fahey) offers Machete a large sum of money to assassinate staunch Anti Immigration Senator John McLaughlin (Robert De Niro) but its all a set up.Don Johnson is a corrupt racist cop who kills illegal immigrants and Jessica Alba plays an Immigration agent who helps out Machete.Robert Rodriguez has made a glossy B movie satire with a few star names, some political digs on immigration issues and hypocritical anti migration politicians and police.Its still down and dirty like its fake trailer. Machete is lethal with the blade, there are some over the top gruesome and funny scenes and he even finds time to be a ladies man.An enjoyable if silly film, some of the actors like Johnson, Fahey and De Niro are having a hoot playing despicable villains. Steven Seagal is out of his element among such company as the main bad guy. He is just too fat and out of shape.",Machete
4,claudio_carvalho,THE FILM of Danny Trejo,8,9 April 2011,"In Mexico, the determinate federal agent Machete Cortez (Danny Trejo) opposes to the order of his chief and drives with his partner to the hideout of the drug lord Rogelio Torrez (Steven Seagal) to rescue an abducted woman (Mayra Leal) that is witness against the gangster. However, he finds the witness naked on the bed but he is surprisingly betrayed by her, and his wife and daughter are murdered by Torrez. Three years later, Machete is an illegal immigrant in Texas that wanders on the streets seeking job in the Day Labor Site. He is hired by Michael Booth (Jeff Fahey) to assassinate the boasting right-winged Senator John McLaughlin (Robert De Niro), who is against the immigrants and defends the construction of an electrified fence along the border with Mexico. Machete receives one hundred and fifty thousand dollars for the assignment, but he gives the money to Luz (Michelle Rodriguez), a Mexican woman that sells taco in her truck and manages the underground Network that assists illegal Mexicans and helped Machete three years ago.When Machete is ready as a sniper in a tower, he finds that he has been betrayed and set up by Booth, who actually is McLaughlin's adviser and plotted the scheme to improve the statistics with the sympathy of the electors to McLaughlin. Once again Machete survives and discovers that Booth supports the vigilantes led by the cruel Von Jackson (Don Johnson) and is associated to Torrez. Now Machete seeks revenge against his enemies and becomes a myth.""Machete"" is a funny action movie and THE FILM of Danny Trejo that perfectly fits to the anti-hero. The story follows the style of B- movies, with exploitation and ultra-violence, but has a cast that is a constellation of stars. There are memorable lines (my favorite is when the priest says ""God has mercy, I don't"") and details, like the name of the garage (Machete's Chop Shop). I have just watched this film on DVD, and the deleted scenes shows many details of the story that unfortunately have been deleted in the edition, like the twin sister of Sartana Rivera ""Sis"", or Rose McGowan as the assassin ""Boots McCoy"". My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Machete""Note: On 22 September 2015, I saw this film again.",Machete
5,nogodnomasters,GRIND HOUSE CLASSIC,9,16 May 2019,"Another movie that was designed to be bad. This movie is patterned after the other Grindhouse type films with nudity, killing, guns, excessive blood, bad acting, bad dialogue, and a plot that doesn't make much sense. In this film Rodriguez thankfully parts way with the Drive-in intermission as well as the fake burning film, and film noise.Danny Trejo, who makes Steve Tyler look like a pretty boy is the main hero is this film. Jessica Alba plays an immigration agent. Steven Seagal, using various bad Mexican accents plays a drug lord. DeNiro is a state senator who, along with his aide is in cahoots with the drug lord as well as a vigilante group along the border. Michelle Rodriquez leads a group of poor Mexicans, all with cell phones.The plot is immaterial. In one scene the car starts on fire before it hits anything...then explodes. Lindsey Lohan goes topless and later dresses in a nun's outfit, packed with a gun. (Plot Spoiler?) She goes to shoot DeNiro, and says, ""In the name of my father"" BAM! BAM! then says ""I forgot the rest."" In the end, all alliances break down and everyone tries to kill everyone.Alba is also naked in the shower with her arms and legs strategically placed. She is best in the deleted scenes as her own twin sister which we never see in the movie. Every time Alba comes home she finds her in bed with some guy. Her twin calls her a ""B"" word and Alba responds by calling her a ""sl*t.""There is nothing believable in this movie, nor should we expect it. Oh yes, and the nurses wear very short smocks.There are no Asians in school girl outfits. I wonder how they missed that?",Machete
6,kosmasp,Weapon of choice,8,15 January 2011,"2010 could also have been a year in the 80s. Expandables and other movies tried and succeeded in copying the formula that was successful back then. Not everyone might like that, but the movies were successful. How would have thought that? And who would have thought that De Niro and Lindsay Lohan would be in the same movie? The cast is phenomenal though (M. Rodriguez, Jessica Alba, the latter has an infamous scene, I'm sure you'll read quite a bit about it here, but Lohan plus 1 steal the show, ""dressing""-wise) and while there is not much story here, it is told in a very nice fashion. There is a commercial (animated), that retells the ""Machete"" story in a funny way. And Danny Trejo tells the story (though you should watch the movie, because there are spoilers in it, of course).You have to love Danny Trejo (who clearly enjoys being the center of attention, either in the movie or at conventions and deservedly so), if you don't you might not enjoy the movie as much as other people do.",Machete
7,lee_eisenberg,"Hispanic ""Inglourious Basterds""",10,4 September 2010,"Robert Rodriguez's gut-busting ""Machete"" first appeared to audiences as a bogus ad in ""Grindhouse"", Rodriguez's collaboration with Quentin Tarantino that paid tribute to 1970s exploitation flicks. It carried the tag-line IF YOU HIRE HIM TO KILL THE BAD GUY, THE BAD GUY SURE AS HELL BETTER NOT BE YOU! Well, now the movie arrives as a feature, and it's one of the coolest flicks of the year. Rodriguez regular Danny Trejo plays the title role, a Mexican federal agent who lost his family to drug kingpin Torrez (Steven Seagal). A few years later, Machete has immigrated to Texas, where he gets framed for an assassination attempt on a racist senator (Robert DeNiro). Mostly, the movie is an excuse for every tongue-in-cheek gory trick imaginable. They leave nothing to the imagination. It's sort of like ""Inglourious Basterds"" in the sense of showing an ethnic group's wet dream (in this case Latinos). Arizona's SB 1070 has made the movie even more relevant, although I'm sure that ""Machete"" was intended to mostly serve as an homage to the sorts of movies that got shown in grindhouses.Anyway, this is one great movie. Violence, nudity, and intrigue all rolled into one, with lots of Tex-Mex slang to boot. Completely absurd and proud of it. You can't afford to miss ""Machete"". Also starring Jessica Alba, Michelle Rodriguez, Jeff Fahey, Cheech Marin, Don Johnson, Lindsay Lohan, Tom Savini, and a slew of Hispanic-Americans (including some of the hottest Latinas whom I've ever seen!).",Machete
8,jboothmillard,Machete,5,14 April 2011,"Originally it started as a mock trailer at the beginning of one of the two Grindhouse double-bill films, i.e. Planet Terror, and obviously fans were so impressed that director Robert Rodriguez (From Dusk Till Dawn, Sin City) turned into the real deal. Basically Officer Machete Cortez (Danny Trejo) is the highly skilled illegal immigrant who suffered the death of his wife and daughter and had his house burned down by powerful drug lord Rogelio Torrez (Steven Seagal). Three years later he has recovered from his physical injuries and now makes a living as a casual labourer, but he is being brought out of what seems like retirement by Michael Booth (Jeff Fahey). He is hiring Machete to assassinate corrupt Texas State Senator McLaughlin (Robert De Niro) for $150,000, but on a day when he is watching him he is double-crossed as one of Booth's henchmen shoots him and then shoots the Senator in the leg. This was all part of the plan though to make McLaughlin more popular with voters in order to secure an electrified border-fence between Mexico and America, and he is obviously set up as the gunman shooting because of the immigrant laws. The Senator of course is in cahoots with both Booth and Torrez, and he also enjoys carrying a gun around to manually sort out the immigrant problem. Machete meanwhile is now on the run from the police as well as the villains, Sartana Rivera (Jessica Alba) was originally meant to catch him and take him away, but she realises he used to be a cop himself and believes the set-up, so she joins his side to get revenge. In order to get to Booth, as he knows there may be some connection with Torrez, Machete films himself on video having a fling with Booth's daughter April (Lindsay Lohan) and June (Alicia Marek), this of course enrages him even more. After a few chases and a fight or two, Machete and loads of his immigrant friends all join together to go against the villains, including recently one-eyed Luz aka Shé (Michelle Rodriguez), especially after the death of friend Padre Cortez (Richard 'Cheech' Marin). In the end, April seemed to have shot the Senator after finding out he shot her father, but he is actually killed by some immigrant haters, and Machete being made a legal member of society by Sartana. Also starring Daryl Sabara as Julio, Don Johnson as Von, Tom Savini as Osiris Amanpour and Gilbert Trejo as Jorge. Trejo, more often a supporting star, makes a good lead, and returning trailer actors Marin and Fahey do well, and the addition of all star supporting members like DeNiro and Lohan is a great idea, the action sequences are few but full of fun, it could have been a little better story wise, but a good fun B-movie like action crime thriller. Worth watching!",Machete
9,Tweekums,Fun Mexploitation action!,8,19 April 2019,"In the opening scenes a Mexican cop known only as Machete is on a mission to rescue a kidnapped; things do not go according to plan. He is captured by drug lord Rogelio Torrez, who kills his wife before leaving him for dead. Of course he does not die and three years later he is over the border in Texas. Here he gets caught up in a plot to kill a state senator who is proposing to build an electrified border fence; once again things don't go as he expected; he was played and now everybody is looking for him. His allies are Sartana Rivera, an honest immigration officer and Luz, a woman helping Mexicans get into America. They will have to go up against corrupt politicians, vigilantes and drug lords.I confess that I didn't expect too much of this film but ended up enjoying it from start to finish. The plot may not be the most original but it serves to deliver lots of great action and a surprising number of laughs. It must be stated that the action is very violent at times; people are decapitated with machetes and shotgun blasts to the face, a man is crucified and there are many other gory details. There is also a fair amount of nudity. These details may offend some viewers but they are all part of the exploitation genre which fans should enjoy. The cast includes some surprisingly big names; most obviously Robert De Niro who is a lot of fun as the racist state senator. We also get Steven Seagal as the evil Torrez; Jessica Alba as the Immigration Officer; Michelle Rodriguez as Luz; Lindsay Lohan, as the daughter of the senator's corrupt aide; and Don Johnson as a vigilante. These people are all solid however it is Danny Trejo who dominates the film as the eponymous Machete; a character as tough as old boots who we just know will prevail. Overall I'd say this is a fun example of the genre that never takes itself too seriously without getting silly... well worth watching.",Machete
10,BA_Harrison,"If anyone can, the Mexican can.",7,27 November 2010,"Robert Rodriguez's action-packed faux trailer for Mexploitation flick Machete was easily the best thing about 2007's disappointing throwback double-bill Grindhouse; in fact, it looked so tantalising, they decided to turn it into a full length film!Sadly, Machete—The Movie doesn't quite live up to the sheer awesomeness that was the trailer, occasionally losing momentum thanks to the unnecessary complexity of its politically motivated plot, suffering from a touch too much poorly executed CGI gore, and resorting to abject silliness by the end; thankfully, however, there's still enough impossibly cool action and outrageous bad-assery to qualify it as a genuinely entertaining and worthwhile experience for fans of mindless movie violence (as a tribute to the crazy exploitation classics of the 70s, it's certainly a lot more successful than either Death Proof or Planet Terror, the full length 'features' between which the trailer was originally sandwiched).The action, when it happens, is brilliantly cartoonish and ultra-gory in its execution; director Rodriguez is clearly having a blast bringing his death and destruction to the screen, even finding time to throw in a few nods to exploitation classics Tarantino style, with tough babe Michelle Rodriguez sporting a leather eye patch ala They Call Her One Eye and Lindsay Lohan getting kitted out in a Ms. 45 nun's habit to deliver bloody retribution. Likewise, the first-class cast, which consists of a handful of hip Hispanic movie stars plus a few familiar faces from North of the Border (to appeal to us gringos), look like they are having a riot, clearly relishing every audacious B-movie moment to the max.It doesn't matter in the slightest that Trejo is perhaps a couple of decades too old for his role as an invincible fighter and irresistible love machine, or that much of the action defies the laws of physics—those things are by-the-by when dealing with this kind of unrealistic OTT entertainment. What matters is that people get graphically sliced up by impossibly mean-looking blades, massive machine guns and rocket launchers are considered everyday appliances for the film's characters, the hot women—of which there are plenty—get nekkid (yes, even Jessica Alba!), and that Machete refers to himself in the third person throughout in order to sound as tough as possible. All of those things are in abundance, so sit back and enjoy the bloodbath!7.5 out of 10, happily rounded up to 8 for the always impressive sight of Jessica Alba's bodacious butt.***Re-assessed 15/7/2011 — 7.5 is still my rating, but as awesome as JA's tush is, I don't think the film is memorable enough for me to round my score up to 8***",Machete
11,paul_haakonsen,Simply put... COOL,7,19 September 2010,"This is one heck of a ride! ""Machete"" delivers, right to the point and in your face.If you liked the movie ""Planet Terror"", then you will most definitely have to sit down and watch ""Machete"", it is right up there with it. The same level of action, violence and absurdity. Robert Rodriguez proves, yet again, that he knows what he is doing, and that he has his finger on the pulse.Now, take the assembly of cast here, lots of heavy weighters here, and they all pull their share of the load so well. You got names like Robert De Niro, Don Johnson, Michelle Rodriguez, Lindsay Lohan, Jeff Fahey, Jessica Alba, Steven Seagal, Cheech Marin and of course, Danny Trejo. It is bound to be one action-packed ride - and it is! Trust me.As for the roles portrayed by the different actors. What came off the weakest in my point was Jessica Alba's character. Her acting was not the cause for that, because she is a great actress. It was just her character seemed hard to fully dig into and believe in.Don Johnson pulled his role of superbly. And it was good to see him in a role as a non-goodie-two-shoes.Robert De Niro did fairly well in his role as well. He sure came off the screen in a believable fashion. As did Jeff Fahey.As for Steven Seagal. Wow! What a twist of character portrayal this was. It was actually cool to see him play a bad guy for once, and not the usual ex-CIA, ex-FBI, ex-blah blah blah, he usually does. So hats off to him for that.Michelle Rodriguez, well I am a big fan of her and her movies in general, and I must admit that I loved her part in this movie, especially in the last part of the movie. Just one word to summarize that; WOW! And of course, Danny Trejo. He was superb in the role as Machete. There is just something about that guy that shouts ""tough guy walking"". And he carried most of the movie, that's for sure.And similar to ""Planet Terror"", the way that the movie is shot and the way it looks, just have that classic feel to it, very retro and very cool. Rodriguez have pulled this off so well.I think this movie actually have potential enough to become a cult action movie somewhere down the line. I know that this is one movie that will be added to my collection once it is available in the stores.This is one cool movie, action and explosions, guns blazing and machete's slashing from start till end. Definitely a movie that you have to watch!",Machete
12,Quinoa1984,a big greasy-delicious burrito of a movie: it gets the job done,8,2 September 2010,"Robert Rodriguez, along with his fellow collaborators (unlike on, say, El Mariachi he has back-up this time, including a co-director, co-writer and co-editor), knows the score. Taking a cue from the love poured on him over one of the greatest trailers of the new century attached with 2007's Grindhouse, he took the ball and decided to just run the f*** out of it. I have no idea how the movie will be received by not just the general public- who by now may have lapsed some memory of the trailer from Grindhouse (save for some unfortunately green-band trailers shown in cineplexes)- but the fans of the trailer. Some may wonder why it was even made, a one-note joke stretched out for 100 minutes. But Rodriguez has some things on his mind with his flick, and does a fantastic job of not covering a thing up. This is a Mexican cry for revolution, with the guy who does one thing very well: KILL! Somewhere inside of it's red-green-and-white striped exploitation-ness is a social satire, of sorts. Machete got double-crossed, was once a federale and his wife and child were killed (none other by Steven Segal in his only (!) villain appearance to date). He's hired to kill a state senator who is a super anti-immigration douche, and as Machete goes to kill him for a large sum of bills, he's set-up again and shot. But, being Machete, he can't be put down so easily. He'll go after the guys who killed him and, as the story unfolds, other points of vengeance come up for him on the trek to find Segal. Along the way he runs into She (you know, like Che, only Michelle Rodriguez running a taco stand), and a border patrol agent (Jessica Alba, yeah, she's here too), and they, like Machete, also have to know the score. Machete is chock-full of jokes, some are more obvious than others, and it's perhaps Rodriguez's first time since Once Upon a Time in Mexico (not counting Grindhouse) to go all-out with the action AND comedy, sometimes at once, sometimes separate. This should go without saying not every line or bit of comedy works, but so much does, and so much is packed with a bad-ass punch, stab, decapitation, dismemberment, explosion, gun-fire, crucification and whatever the hell else that it makes up for it in spades. I was even able to overlook some use of CGI blood where it could have been lessened (or, as in other parts, just plain ol' blood and guts). Rodriguez and company just want to keep their audience glued to the screen, awaiting the next actor to be as over-the-top as the next one, or go over. Watching (ho-ho, ""introducing"") Don Johnson and a (fake) hillbilly-inflected Robert De Niro spare off in downright villainy reminded me of what REAL dirt-bag villains are like. The Expendables, take note, this is how you do B- movie action.As mentioned, not everything works to the kind of near-perfect effect that Planet Terror had. I didn't buy Alba as a border patrol officer, though then again her lack of talent and surplus of good looks probably serve her best here. I also wanted a little more insanity in a couple of the action scenes (which one top be precise I'd need to watch again and give audio commentary). But as someone who is hungry for a kick-ass exploitation flick, for balls-to-the-wall action, unapologetically throwing logic into a blender and putting it back into a taco, and can't get enough of Danny Trejo slicing people up and going over the finer points of texting his threats to the villains, it hits the spot. It doesn't pretend to be anything more than it is, and people can take it as a goofy comic-book send-up of current events at the south of the border, or they can take it a little too seriously and not get the point (to read some comments, for example, on IMDb, one might think Rodriguez made a polemic on par with Spike Lee). In short, it's not too crazy, but it's never lazy and never settles for making the audience feel antsy. At it's best, Machete has the energy and pizazz of RR's first feature, El Mariachi. He hasn't lost his joy for filmmaking, and if nothing else it shows. And, as one last thing to boot, he may have just jump-started Lindsay Lohan's career! Take with that what you will.",Machete
13,BandSAboutMovies,Amusing,7,18 April 2019,"Machete first appeared as a character in Robert Rodriguez's kid-friendly Spy Kids films, then came back as a fake trailer in the Grindhouse movie.The origins of the character come from when Rodriguez worked with Danny Trejo on the film Desperado, thinking, ""This guy should be like the Mexican Jean-Claude Van Damme or Charles Bronson, putting out a movie every year and his name should be Machete."" He was inspired by the films of John Woo, wanting to make a movie in their spirit that would be for a Latino audience.Machete Cortez (Trejo) was once a Mexican Federal but his partner and wife were killed when he was betrayed to former cop and current drug cartel leader Rogelio Torrez (Steven Seagal).Now, he's an immigrant to the U.S., barely scraping by doing yard work. Michael Booth (Jeff Fahey) pays him to shoot Texas State Senator John McLaughlin (Robert De Niro), which is an easy job to take because the politician is anti-Mexican, sending many immigrants back to Mexico and collaborating with Von Jackson (Don Johnson) and his militia of border patrol ruffians.Booth offers Machete $150,000 - and makes threats on his life if he doesn't do the job - so our hero takes the assignment. However, he's been set up again and barely escapes with his life.The rest of the film concerns Machete's bloody revenge and dealings with all manner of characters, from Immigration Agent Sartana Rivera (Jessica Alba) to underground leader Luz (Michelle Rodriguez), his brother Padre (Cheech Marin) and even Booth's wife and daughter (Lindsay Lohan). Tom Savini even shows up as Osiris Amanpour (Tom Savini), a hitman who has an infomercial.It's all rather ridiculous, but that's a lot of the fun of this movie. How often do you see a movie where the hero uses a man's entrails as a rope to climb down a building? They could make a thousand of these movies and I'd probably watch every single one of them.",Machete
14,Coventry,I ❤ extreme violence,8,3 April 2011,"Presumably like most other people around here who commented on ""Machete"", I've been looking forward to this ever since I saw the (at that point) fake trailer in Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez' grindhouse project. That particular short feature looked cooler than ""Death Proof"", ""Planet Terror"" and all the other fake trailers combined! The popularity of Danny Trejo's rapidly created character became so immense that the coming of a full length feature film simply became inevitable. Usually I'd say that's a very risky undertaking, because editing a handful of awesome shots together in a trailer is one thing, but keeping an audience entertained and thrilled throughout an hour and a half is a completely different story. But with writer/director Robert Rodriguez you can generally rest assured of one thing: he will deliver. And boy did he ever deliver with ""Machete""! This is the action/cult/grindhouse fanatic's ultimate wet dream come to life. A never ending smörgåsbord of immortal heroes, utterly evil villains, ravishing babes with machine guns, cheesy dialogs, absurdly grotesque stunts, gratuitous blood and splatter and a wide garden variety of imaginative killing methods. If you seriously don't see the humor in our hero swinging from one hospital floor to another, using a poor victim's ripped out intestines, then I guess Rodriguez' homage to popcorn grindhouse cinema is not for you. And yet, even though the emphasis in ""Machete"" primarily lies on extravagant violence and caricatures, Rodriguez' nevertheless still managed to pen down a compelling and socially relevant scenario. Machete, birth name unknown, once worked as a respectable Mexican federal agent until his former partner turned super-villain Torrez butchered his family and left him for dead. Three years later, Machete inconspicuously hangs around the Mexican-American border hoping to make some money as an illegal day worker. One morning, Machete is randomly picked out of the bunch and gets offered a large sum in cash to assassinate the Texan senator McLaughlin. Machete accepts. Not so much for the money, but mostly because McLaughlin is racist scum who pleads to build a large electric fence to keep out Mexican immigrants. The whole assault turns out to be a set-up designed by McLaughlin's campaign leaders to boost up his popularity amongst the American voters. Machete naturally doesn't like to be used as a marionette in political games, especially not if they're trying to kill him afterwards, and decides to single-handedly dismantle the dirty conspiracy. Well, not entirely single-handedly, as he receives help from the yummy revolutionary leader Shé, the even yummier immigration agent Sartana and his equally ass-kicking brother slash priest. Apart from the literally gallons of blood, hacked off heads and various other body parts and shiny cutting tools, ""Machete"" is also a brilliant showcasing of terrific actors in often very atypical roles. Machete's arch-enemy, for instance, is depicted by no less than a rather chubby Steven Seagal. I never expected to see him in such a despicable role, but he handles it perfectly and clearly enjoyed it a lot. The other villainous roles are wondrously filled in by Robert DeNiro (excellent as the corrupt senator), Jeff Fahey, special effects wizard Tom Savini and an astonishingly loathsome Don Johnson as a trigger-happy border patrol cop. The Hollywood babes who were lucky enough (?) to share the bed with the heavily tattooed Danny Trejo are Jessica Alba and Michelle Rodriguez.",Machete
15,Scarecrow-88,Machete,7,9 September 2010,"Ethan Maniquis and Robert Rodriguez' highly anticipated homage to action exploitation takes the hot button issue of immigration as a center for the film MACHETE involving a former Mexican federale(Danny Trejo) whose former partner, Torrez(Steven Seagal)turned against him to become a powerful drug lord. Machete(Trejo), three years later after Torrez beheaded his wife, is now in America illegally, offered 150, 000 dollars by a mysterious benefactor, Booth(Jeff Fahey)to assassinate anti-immigration senator, McLaughlin(Robert De Niro)up for re-election and slipping in the poles. In fact, it turns out Booth is McLaughlin's assistant(which means he ""gets things done"")and sets Machete up so that the senator could gain sympathy votes for being the victim of a hit(Machete narrowly escapes being gunned down by one of Booth's gunsels)from a Mexican.Michelle Rodriguez is celebrated Mexican icon, She(a female equivalent to Che Gavarra), going by the fake name of Luz in America, whose taco stand is just a front for a secret network where she helps illegals cross the border and get employment. Cheech Marin is a former federale, now a Padre, who is Machete's greatest ally, who has a series of cameras which help him watch around his church in case of trouble. Jessica Alba is Sartana, an ICE immigration agent with career designs to move up the ladder, getting involved with Machete, wanting the big break to send her to the top. Don Johnson, his serpent grin as venomous as ever, is a border cop who is above the law and helps gun down illegals attempting to cross over into Texas. A cast of many faces, but this is Trejo's movie all the way. Alba does have a sizable role as Machete's ally(in a way using Machete as a means for career advancement, slowly seeing the error of her ways; she does believe in the law and justice). Seagal is essentially in a glorified cameo, only really involved in the action towards the end when he engages in a sword fight with Trejo. Rodriguez will be the product of my fantasies for some time to come, although, sadly, she doesn't have much to do(in regards to shooting people) until the end. Lindsay Lohen has a funny small part as Fahey's tramp daughter, including one scene where she's doped in some drug hangout where Booth walks in blasting dealers right and left. Johnson's border order is so hostile he shoots a pregnant Mexican in cold blood, allowing McLaughlin the pleasure of using a rifle on the girl's husband! I was a bit disappointed that there wasn't more practical effects and on-screen violence with sharp weaponry, although there's one priceless scene where Machete guts a baddie, with a surgical ""skull scraper"", using the guy's intestines as rope to swing out a window into another room in the floor below inside a hospital where the poor are treated! One of the more bizarre scenes is where Seagal performs Seppuku and we are brief witnesses to a crucifixion where Tom Savini's assassin helps Fahey torture a victim during an interrogation using large spikes and hammer. Trejo gets on a motorcycle with a Gatling gun attached to obliterate several of Johnson's dirtbags, and annihilates many coming towards him with a machete so long it resembles a sword. Alba gets to kill a hired thug(wearing a luchadore mask!) using her high heels! The filmmakers pay special homage to both Ferrara's Ms 45(Lohan dressed as a nun fires off a machine gun!)and THRILLER:A CRUEL PICTURE(Rodriguez' eye is shot by Johnson, and she dons an eyepatch answering someone during the all-blazes finale regarding her name, ""Call me One-Eye""). But, for some reason, the duo directors pull some punches, not always showing bodily damage at the hands of Machete who wields all sorts of homemade blade weapons to slice and dice. MACHETE will fit nicely in a double feature with any of Rodriguez' ""Mariachi"" movies, directed in the same spirit. I could've done without the whole immigration story forced down our gullets, but RR & EM felt it was important enough to utilize with great regard. This must've been a dream come true for Trejo, FINALLY getting to headline a major mainstream movie; I, for one, was glad he had the chance.",Machete
16,Hey_Sweden,"""I thought Machete don't text."" ""Machete improvises.""",7,8 May 2012,"Robert Rodriguez delivers on the promise of his ""Grindhouse"" trailer for a movie that's simply a good deal of fun, with lots of moments of entertaining excess. Despite containing some serious themes, it refuses to ever take itself too seriously, never forgetting that what we're essentially supposed to see is exploitation writ large. The energy is undeniable, the enthusiasm infectious. Danny Trejo, a regular in Rodriguez's films, finally gets boosted to true star status as the title character, a former federale who accepts a creepy gringo's offer of $150,000 to take out a U.S. senator (Robert De Niro) whose campaign is entirely based on his approach to the illegal immigration issue. Machete gets double crossed, and spends the balance of the movie determined to get revenge, and helping out a federal agent (Jessica Alba) to figure out the whole busy plot, which involves an old nemesis of his (Steven Seagal), a prominent drug kingpin. This is just too hard to resist at times, as Rodriguez takes things to a completely over the top level. The viewer will likely howl in appreciation seeing the sequence where Machete makes handy use of a man's lower intestine. Even in light of the fact that a lot of the gore is of the digital variety, it's a hoot just how much splatter is seen before the film is over. As usual, the filmmaker has real fun with his casting choices; old hand ""Cheech"" Marin is especially delicious as the Padre who utters the immortal line, ""God has mercy, I don't."" Also appearing are Michelle Rodriguez as the taco truck owner who may be connected to a Network sympathetic to the plight of the Mexican people, Jeff Fahey as the sleazy suit with the cash, Lindsay Lohan as his sex pot daughter who ends up gunning extras down while dressed as a nun, Don Johnson (who, as an obvious joke, gets an ""introducing"" credit!) as the leader of a group of vigilantes, and Tom Savini as a notorious hit man. Seagal, in one of his most enjoyable outings in a while, is actually delicious as the bad guy. Overall, the movie is stylish, hip, loud, and a knowing homage to the exploitation films of yesteryear, displaying a great sense of humour yet having the actors play it straight. The result is fine tongue in cheek entertainment. Hopefully we can get more feature films based off of the ""Grindhouse"" trailers in the future. Seven out of 10.",Machete
17,LeonLouisRicci,Obnoxious and Overbearing Fun For Fans,7,14 July 2012,"Another ultra violent, extreme, over the top, action romp from a very talented auteur. The Director has many imitators but few equals in this type of tongue in cheek, wink and nod expositions. The political stuff is where the Director lets his guard down. It seems he is reluctant to take the subject to the next level of extreme as he does with everything else. This must be just too sensitive and close to home to let it all hang out and the overall ham-fisted tone of the movie suffers from this ""restraint"".The ending really has nowhere to go and runs out of gas with stilted posing and repetitive renderings of earlier work and does not seem inspired.Fun, for fans of this type of pulp, but some may find it obnoxious and overbearing. It never lets up and is an exciting, off road ride for those with the stomach to endure.",Machete
18,poolandrews,"Fun, if lightweight, gory action adventure.",5,1 August 2011,"Machete starts in Mexico as a federal agent codenamed Machete (Danny Trejo) raids the hideout of Mexican drug lord Rogelio Torrez (Steven Seagal) in order to rescue a female hostage, once inside Machete is overpowered & Torrez murders his wife in front of him before setting the house on fire & leaving Machete to die. Six years later & Machete has fled to Texas as an illegal immigrant, he works as a labourer doing whatever he can. Corrupt political aid Michal Booth (Jeff Fahey) sees Machete in a street fight & decides to hire him, Booth tells Machete to assassinate US senator John McLaughlin (Robert De Nero) who is trying to get reelected in order to pass a law to build an electrified fence across the Mexican Texas border. Machete accepts but discovers the whole deal is a set-up in order to gain support for the senator & he is the fall guy who everyone is looking for. Suspected of trying to assassinate a US senator Machete has to clear his name & help his fellow Mexicans in a war against racist vigilantes...Co-edited, co-written, co-produced & co-directed by Robert Rodriquez this over the top action adventure film was based on the fake Machete trailer that featured in Grindhouse (2007), while quite fun in a bloody sort of way I was maybe expecting a little bit more from Machete. The film starts off with drug lord Torrez murdering Machete's wife in front of him & I thought from that moment Machete was going to be a revenge thriller but little else is made of this prologue & what follows feels like a slightly muddled political thriller with extreme bouts of violence & silly action scenes. While it's watchable & moves along at a decent pace I never really dug the Machete character & there are too many bad guy's none of whom really stand out, Steven Seagal's drug lord is barely in it while the likes of Robert De Nero, Jeff Fahey, Tom Savini & Don Johnson are all good actors & somehow feel underused in villainous roles. There are some hot babes in this, in fact the women in machete are there to look great & kick ass rather than add any dramatic weight to proceedings, Jessica Alba in particular looks red hot but has little to do other than good (which, to be fair, she does admirably). The script has a slight political agenda with the thorny issue of illegal immigration together with associated themes but it seems rather out of place & a little simple. There's a few memorable scenes as Machete slices, shoots & blows his way through various bad guy's & even manages to get the girl on more than one occasion. There's plenty of violence on show, nudity & outrageous scenes but there's a definite sense of humour here & while Machete isn't that deep or even that memorable overall there's still fun to be had here.There is gore here but much of it is just splattered blood, whenever someone is shot there are blood splats everywhere, Machete cuts some peoples heads & hands off, Machete uses someones intestines to abseil out of a window while someone is crucified & others have their heads blown off with shotguns. There's a fair amount of nudity too & all the women here are hot. The Blu-ray I watched last night looked good (that Danny Trejo has a really textured face...) & featured some deleted scenes including character's & subplots missing from the final film including Sartana's twin sister & a female assassin called Boots McCoy although none of these scenes would have added that much.With a fairly modest $10,500,000 budget there's plenty of action on screen for that, while not the most exiting or big budget action scenes there are still car crashes, explosions, shoot-outs & fights. Filmed in Texas. The acting is good from a decent cast who all ham it up, rather than lose in a fight Seagal bizarrely commits suicide at the end while Lindsay Lohan gets naked & dresses up as Nun.Machete is a fun action film with a sense of humour & a sense of outrageousness with some gory set-pieces & over the top action but was lacking a captivating story which just seemed to plod along trying not to get in the way of the next blood splatter. The end credits promise that Machete will return in Machete Kills & Machete Kills Again but so far neither have been made.",Machete

20,utgard14,Concept is better than the execution,5,22 February 2014,"Machete is a one-joke concept that isn't interesting enough to sustain a whole movie. As a satire, it has some merit. There are some funny moments here and there. As a straight action movie, it's very weak. The action scenes are mostly dull and uninspired. Danny Trejo is old, out of shape, and makes for a poor action hero. Too bad this wasn't made five or ten years earlier. The climax of this movie is one old guy fighting another old guy. Both move like they fear hip displacement. Like most people, I enjoyed the Machete trailer during Grindhouse a great deal. Unfortunately the movie doesn't live up to that. The entire thing is built around Danny Trejo and, in my opinion, he's better suited for supporting roles. He just can't carry a film on his own. The supporting cast is better with the exception being Jessica Alba, who is terrible. I'm not an Alba basher but she really does stink up the joint here. She has no sense for comedy and the parts where she is playing it straight are unsteady and awkward. She looks great, of course. All the women do. So the movie does have that going for it. I'm not trying to bash the movie and be ultra-critical of what is just meant to be a tongue-in-cheek action flick. I realize what it's supposed to be. I just don't think it's that good. It's watchable filler but nothing more special than that.",Machete
21,lastliberal,Machete don't text.,8,4 September 2010,"How do you rate a movie like this? The fact that we waited three years to see it on screen is bound to cause us to rate it higher than it deserves. My rating is not for film quality, but strictly for the film's entertainment value. It was a blast from start to finish.To say that heads will roll in this film is an understatement. The gore level is very high with many beheadings. Maybe the Governor of Arizona had this movie in mind when she talked about beheadings in the desert.It is appropriate to mention the Governor of Arizona and her campaign to remove all brown people from the State, as the movie is very anti-redneck, and ridicules those who forget that ""we didn't cross the border, the border crossed us."" The character of Texas State Senator McLaughlin (Robert De Niro) is perfect caricature of a certain anti-gay Texas State Representative in the Panhandle. And Don Johnson was perfect as the redneck leader of the murdering militia.I don't know what to say about Steven Seagal in his first role as a bad guy. He needs a face lift, he had a bad face lift, he overused botox, or he is just not aging well. He looked horrible.Now, the fact that we got to enjoy Lindsay Lohan and Alicia Rachel Marek's tatas was nice, but I'm telling you that the absolute female in this film was Michelle Rodriguez. She kept her clothes on, but she was hot! I don't know how many of Danny Trejo's many many film appearances I have seen - it has been a lot - but I am glad that he finally got a starring role. And, he got to ride off into the sunset with Jessica Alba. It doesn't get any better than that.If you like Grindhouse action, then you will not want to miss this film.",Machete
22,zardoz-13,Trejo's Best!!!,8,7 October 2013,"At its best, director Robert Rodriguez's revenge thriller ""Machete"" is outlandish and audacious. Any movie where the hero chops off the heads of three armed adversaries at close quarters isn't half bad. Machete doesn't confine himself to the sole use of a machete. He employs weed-eaters, garden shears, rifles, and revolvers. For the record, ""Machete"" appeared as a 'fake' movie trailer in another bizarre Rodriguez zombie saga ""Planet Terror."" According to Rodriguez, the fake ""Machete"" generated more interest than any of other mock trailers. Ironically, the ""Desperado"" director had planned to helm a ""Machete"" in the early 1990s but nothing came of it. The rugged, mustached, extensively tattooed Danny Trejo plays a former Mexican Federal police officer who was left for death by notorious, drug kingpin Rogelio Torrez. Torrez complains that he has the C.I.A. and the D.E.A. in his payroll, but Machete Cortez remains hopelessly incorruptible. Rodriguez stages several interesting shoot-outs. ""Machete"" qualifies as a good, action-packed movie that doesn't take itself seriously, with lively action scenes. The action sequences are blood-splattered, over-the-top exercises in cartoon-like violence. For example, our hero uses an adversary's own intestines to rappel from one floor of a building to the next floor. Co-writer & director Rodriguez excels when he stages this kind of ultra-violent nonsense, and Trejo looks perfectly content to be in the middle of all this blood and gore.The high-octane, introductory scene is reminiscent vaguely of the Sean Connery James Bond movie ""Never Say Never Again"" when 007 rescued a kidnapped woman. The last thing Bond expected was that the woman had been brain-washed and that she would stab him. Machete and his partner set out to save a girl who can testify against Torrez. Machete uses his police cruiser as a battering ram to smash his way into the building where the girl is held hostage. Machete kills several adversaries, slicing the heads off three opponents with his namesake as he whirls in a tight circle at close quarters. Eventually, after he locates this damsel, who claims it's too hot for her to wear clothes; she turns on him and slashes him with his own machete. No sooner has this duplicitous damsel double-crossed our hero than Torrez appears. The tall man has the damsel executed by another babe, and then he drags in Machete's wife. He decapitates her before the hero's eyes! Martial arts master Steve Seagal took time off from his own pictures to play the villain, and Torrez is nobody to be treated lightly. He wields swords, and he lacks any qualms.Senator John McLaughlin (Robert De Niro of ""Jackie Brown"") has made it his objective in life to erect an electrified border fence. McLaughlin's adviser Michael Booth (Jeff Fahey of ""The Lawnmower Man"") hires a destitute-looking Machete for the sum of $150-thousand dollars to assassinate McLaughlin during a campaign speech. Booth's chief henchmen wounds not only Machete (who is surprised) but also McLaughlin. Rodriguez keeps piling up plot. We discover Machete has a brother, a Catholic priest (Cheech Martin of ""Up In Smoke"") and McLaughlin changes sides after Von turns against him. Indeed. Robert De Niro looks out of place as a Texas lawmaker, but he embraces the role for everything it offers. His demise is ironic in the general scheme of things. Look for Don Johnson in a supporting role as a vigilante gunman who prowls the border. Special effect guru Tom Saving of ""Night of the Living Dead"" has a small role as a hit man named Osiris Amanpour. Amanpour and his henchmen tangle with the Padre, and the result is a bloody shoot-out. Amanpour wounds Padre in the knee and Booth and he hammer the priest to the cross in the sanctuary as the ultimate example of blasphemy. Rodriguez ties everything to the theme of immigration. Actresses Jessica Alba and Michelle Rodriguez bring sex appeal to the proceedings. Michelle looks incredibly incendiary with her black patch. Rodriguez has upped the ante from a bogus trailer and ""Machete"" ranks as Trejo's best movie. This pugnacious guy resembles Charles Bronson with his craggy face and hulking physique. The formulaic but entertaining crime thriller concludes with the narrator letting us know in James Bond fashion that the eponymous character will return in ""Machete Kills"" and ""Machete Kills Again.""",Machete

He survived... somehow... and now gets by as a day laborer. He's hired by Booth(Jeff Fahey, who I understand is a veteran of this kind of thing) to kill the anti-immigrant(bringing up that thematic, and treating it with no intelligence and a lot of preachiness) bigot senator McLaughlin(Robert De Niro, the one talented actor in this, and even he chews some scenery). It doesn't go as planned, and he now has to take out the people gunning for him and get his much-deserved vengeance. First off, this is what you expect. Brutal, gory, disturbing with gratuitous strong language, female nudity and sexuality(some of it quite perverted). It fits in the majority of the incredible shots in the fake trailer(trust me, everything you really wanted to see is there), and yes, the script was written around those. Is the plot(with countless, usually meaningless and inconsequential, twists... in fact, it's coming dangerously close to Paul W.S. Anderson territory) nonsensical? Oh yes. You can follow it fine on an initial viewing, and in spite of this being as overwritten(with a million ideas that never materialize into anything... well, a few of them could if the performances weren't so lacking) as Once Upon a Time in Mexico, unlike that movie, it isn't intolerable. The action is entertaining, fast and there's plenty of it, without it being excessive. It's also cut with breathing room, again different from aforementioned picture. This doesn't go for the ""grindhouse"" visual aesthetic that Planet Terror did, with scratches on the negative and the like. Dialog has its moments but tends to be forgettable. The score is great, fitting with the 70's/80's exploitation flick. This is kind of a satire on those, and a tribute and entry into the genre. It definitely follows the clichés. While Rodriguez can come up with some marvelous gags, he evidently can't think of enough to go without ripping himself off, and others, as well(unoriginal story much?). The characters are potentially interesting, and fail on account of the cast and the sheer number of them giving no chance of any of them getting sufficient development. Luz(Michelle Rodriguez... well, at least she, like all the other chicks in this, looks fantastic) who works for The Network, an underground organization that gets people into the country, get them jobs and protect them. Sartana(Alba, who has to give a speech that she doesn't even remotely possess the gravitas for), an agent there to stop illegals. Padre(Cheech Marin, cool for probably the only time on-screen), the priest and our hero's brother. Osiris(Tom Savini, probably having the most fun he's had since From Dusk Till Dawn) is a high-class hired killer. April(Lindsay Lohan, portraying... I guess herself, with the bad parenting, drug abuse and lascivious behaviour). And Von(Don Johnson), the racist Texan who, along with his companions, shoot those who jump the border. You don't particularly care about these characters... however, it still goes down surprisingly smooth and you're not bored. The DVD comes with an audience reaction track(some of it goes as you'd think, though at times, they get confused and cheer on the villains...), 11 and a half minutes of genuinely good deleted scenes and trailers for Mariachi trilogy Blu-Ray release, Green Hornet, Faster, Sniper: Reloaded and Priest.

While I have undoubtedly enjoyed some of his films (Sin City, From Dusk Till Dawn), it seems to me that he deliberately ignores many of the qualities one would expect to characterise a ""good"" film in favour of cheerfully going his own way, and not giving a rat's *rse what anyone else thinks. Machete really isn't a very good film, but it features a busload of names having huge fun swearing a lot while taking part in very bloody, but often mildly comical, extreme violence. In doing so, he generates some strikingly iconic images - Michelle Rodriguez' bared-midriff bandolier-wearing one-eyed hottie menace at the end, for a start.I must acknowledge this film's limitations, but I must also praise its energy and vitality.",Machete

There really is no legitimate way to critique it or review it. If you possess the gene that allowed you to enjoy ""Grindhouse"", you will certainly be entertained by ""Machete"".Robert Rodriguez co-directed and co-wrote the film and puts his stamp all over it. There is no challenge to discovering where Mr. Rodriguez stands on the immigration issues. He is fortunate enough to be a filmmaker who can deliver a message in ways that very few can. Of course, this is not strictly speaking a message movie. It is also a spoof ... heck, it's billed as mexploitation! Danny Trejo, character actor extraordinare, finally gets his chance to carry a movie and he seizes the moment. His portrayal of Machete is with enough force and straight-face. There is little doubt that he is the Mexican federale whose family was killed by a drug kingpin (played by Steven Segal). Trejo tries to get on with his life, but is drawn right back in to the battle thanks to a local activist played by Michelle Rodriguez (based in a Taco stand ... yes, really), and by Jeff Fahey, henchman to an ultra racist State Senator played by Robert Deniro.For a movie that prides itself more on brain spatters than brain matter, there are sufficient twists to the story to keep the viewer interested. But the real fun comes in the outrageous moments like opening credits ""introducing Don Johnson"", and the cat-like ability of Machete to avoid certain death. Laughs ensue when Machete drags his brother into the fight. His brother? A new-age priest (Cheech Marin) packing an arsenal in the pews.All of this is going on while an immigration agent played by Jessica Alba is trying to put the squeeze on Lation legend ""She"", who she suspects is Michelle Rodriguez. Alba spends her lunch break playing Wii to keep fit. If all this isn't quirky enough for you, how about Lindsay Lohan playing Fahey's strung out daughter, who later in the film sports a nun's habit and a pistol?

He accepts the job but is double crossed and left for dead. Directed by Robert Rodriguez and Ethan Maniquis as a film version of the mock trailer presented in the Grindhouse double features. Danny Trejo is playing his first lead as Machete. He is out to clear his name, seek vengeance and solve a plot regarding immigration. Jessica Alba plays a cop trying to work her way up. She will see Machete as innocent especially after he saves her ass. Robert De Niro plays the corrupt Senator ranting about immigration rights. The role is somewhat comical especially given where McLaughlin ends up. He proves not to be trusted but his methods come back with fatal consequences. Steven Seagal starts out well as Torres before becoming a waste for a blade fight. Torres committed murder and a betrayal towards Machete but the rest of the film has his mug speaking from a monitor until they meet for a disappointing saber fight. Michelle Rodriguez plays a pointless character who loses an eye and eventually dons the snake Plisskin look as well as the attitude.

Once again betrayed and set-up, Machete plots his revenge against the men who've wronged him....fair warning, if you are expecting anything classy in this film, then steer well clear, any film featuring a woman pulling a cell phone from a certain orifice, is not going to ooze class.If like me, you saw grindhouse, and the best thing about it were the trailers, then this is for you. Arguably, the first ten minutes are the best, featuring a 360 degree decapitation, a double cross, and a very good Steven Seagal.After the opening credits, the movie does struggle to keep up with the prologue, but it's still a fun ride nevertheless. Trejo after over 200 movies has finally got his first (and maybe last) starring role, and he relishes every second he is on screen. Surprisingly a gentle person, the titular character could be the nicest man in the world if he was on your side.But the script and the story do not really do the film justice, and some of the dialogue is borderline cringworthy (see Alba doing her speech on the car bonnet).But this is just a major flaw in what other wise is a pure guilty pleasure. It has bucket loads of gore, some funny set pieces, and for once, the film does live up to the trailer.The best thing here though is Seagal. given his very lean (pardon the pun) screen time, he oozes evil, and is a very convincing villain, and it's also nice to see Fahey in a half decent role for once.Rodriguez certainly knows hot women, and he shares his enthusiasm of the fairer sex plenty in this movie, and gets a good performance from Alba too.This has cult movie written all over it, it won't trouble the box office, and the plot holes are huge. But if you liked the look of the false trailer, chances are you saw Tarantinos phallus melt in planet terror a short while after.highly recommended.",Machete
31,zetes,Pretty awesome,8,12 September 2010,"I'm one of the rare people who loved every moment of Grindhouse and didn't find a dull moment in those three hours. But it isn't hard for me to pick a favorite bit: the Machete trailer that began the experience. It was hilarious and awesome, and I was ecstatic when I heard they were turning it into a real feature. Machete was, in fact, my most anticipated film of the year, so, honestly, it could only disappoint. Thankfully it doesn't disappoint too much. It turns out there are some problems with turning a fake trailer into a feature, mostly because Rodriguez felt he had to include every single scene from that trailer in the finished product. That means he has to create connective tissues between those scenes, and frequently the film feels as if it's stumbling along trying to get to the next bit. Fortunately, Rodriguez really comes to life during his big set pieces (of which there are plenty), and the uber-violent action sequences are pure awesomeness. Danny Trejo comes off more a hatchet-faced, Mexican Jason Vorhees than a hero at times, wasting henchmen with whatever sharp implement he can get his hands on. The cast is very gimmicky, but of course the film is a gimmick itself, so it works (I think Rodriguez really could have cut Lindsey Lohan's role almost entirely). Machete has its flaws (and I'd personally recommend that Rodriguez drop the proposed sequels that are mentioned in the end credits, because these kinds of things always have diminishing returns), but it's a ton of fun.",Machete
32,trashgang,over the top exploitation,8,24 September 2010,"Didn't know what to think about it, after Planet Terror and Death Proof, both failed at the box office, due to bad release I thought, this is going to be bad with some actors in it. But it wasn't. I just seen the full uncut version and I had a big laugh with it. Yes, don't take it too seriously. It's pure exploitation so you know what that means, over the top cinema. Also, we see the return of some old legends. For example Don Johnson, he gives a great performance but the one I was most afraid of was Steven Seagal. What a trash he made in his career but here he gives the best performance I have seen from him in years. Robert De Niro is, well, Robert De Niro. Also big thumbs up for Danny Trejo, excellent performance, looking forward to meet him next month in the flesh. As said, it's pure exploitation, pure grindhouse. So indeed, the gore is all over the movie. Some scene's are over the top but that's typical for that kind of flicks. Of course there is nudity and Lindsay Lohan shows it all. Jeff Fahey, also good performing. If you don't know what grindhouse, drive-ins or exploitation is all about leave it but if you love it than you really will enjoy this flick. And of course Rodriguez, not a sister of the director, is great again and again casted as a tough-chick role. Also funny to see Tom Savini as an actor and not as a special effects man. Great movie, great acting...up to full movie of Tarantino's fake trailer Werewolf Women of the SS.",Machete
33,mm-39,If you saw the preview you know what to expect.,6,6 September 2010,"If you saw the preview you will know what to expect. Machete is similar to the other 1970's style exploitation movies similar to this summer's The last exorcism. The movie is cheesy, over the top,and not to be taken too seriously. Machete has a political message which takes shots at the immigration issue, the church, and stereo-types many cultures have. In today's shock and awe culture Machete hits hard. People in today's shock reality television culture will find Machete entertaining and offensive. Over the top violence and stupid humor is all part of the Machete grind house movie theme. The other movie being made from the ideas from the Grind House movie trailers is Hobo with a shotgun, which I bet will be done in a similar fashion. I give Machete a 6 out of 10. The movie reminds me of similar themes from the director of one man against the system which the director portrayed in Desperado.",Machete

35,siderite,Why would I want to be a person when I am already a myth?,8,29 September 2010,"A while ago there was this pair of films, directed by Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez, marketed under the name of Grindhouse. Both were trying to be as much fun as possible and also tributary to certain genres of films. Between the two movies there was a trailer of a movie called Machete ""They messed with the wrong Mexican"". The response was so great that they decided to actually do the movie.Now, it is hard to rate this film as it is both wonderful and crap at the same time. It brings an homage to Mexican action films and old B side movies. The actors are overacting, the music is ridiculous, the plot is unreal and the dialogues totally cheesy. But everybody had fun and the references and meticulous reenactment of a certain type of movie delicious. If you so far are not getting it, you probably won't like the film.The cast is great, but you can read the list of actors yourself. I would like to note Gilbert Trejo, Danny Trejo's son, and Tina Rodriguez, the sister of Robert Rodriguez.I think the title of this post (and one of the last lines in the movie) are perfect for Danny Trejo. Who would have believed when he was just a drug addicted Mexican criminal that he will live to be a grandfather, an actor with millions of fans that played in so many movies? Way to go, man!",Machete
36,namashi_1,A Fun Bloodbath!,8,29 December 2010,"Let me inform you: 'Machete' is not for the faint-hearted. Nor for the illy-livered. It's an out and out gory film. Filmmaker Robert Rodriguez, yet, succeeds by making his latest outing, A Fun Bloodbath, that will surely entertain it's audience, which I'd like to inform, is quite less. 'Machete' is a vendetta fare. The Hero gets betrayed by the villains, who even go onto to butcher his wife and daughter. So it's obvious, the Hero will take Revenge, at any cost! It's a non-stop blood and gore fest, that is surprisingly funny at times. 'Machete' continues the B movie and exploitation style of Grindhouse, including in part the same footage. Robert Rodriguez is a stylish filmmaker, who loves to show violence in his Cinema. Loves it so much, he doesn't mind butchering Women too! His ""this"" kinda cinema caters to a tiny section of audience, and I am a member of his fan-club. Jimmy Lindsey's Cinematography is top-notch. Performance-Wise: Danny Trejo as 'Machete', is absolutely awesome. Jessica Alba is excellent, and looks too good. Michelle Rodriguez is kick-ass. Jeff Fahey is suave, while Steven Seagal is wooden. Don Johnson and Cheech Marin are hugely effective. But the show actually belongs to, the legendary Robert De Niro. He plays the cool, calculative, conniving villain with unmatchable ease. On the whole, Watch it only if you have the stomach to digest non-stop Bloodshed! I enjoyed this flick! From my side, Two Thumbs Up!",Machete
37,StevePulaski,Entertaining Exploitation goodness for the most part,8,5 April 2011,"If it hadn't been for the fake trailer for the film in Grindhouse, Machete may have never seen the light of day. I plan to review both Grindhouse films in the next couple of months even though I have seen them. I just need to find the time. Machete was one of the few fake trailers created for the special event. For those not familiar with the Grindhouse film I'll give you a quick little rundown.Grindhouse was a back to back movie event that came to theaters in April 2007 directed by both Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez. The films were Planet Terror and Death Proof shown in the grainy format like a Grindhouse theater, a lower end theater in the seventies that would show cheesy action, horror, or comedy exploitation films. To my surprise, Grindhouse flopped and still hasn't made it's full budget back in revenue. Due to the unfamiliar style, many people didn't know they paid to go see two films. Naturally, many people left after the first film (Planet Terror) not knowing another film, Death Proof would follow Planet Terror after the credits.Machete was one of the fake trailers along with Thanksgiving and Hobo with a Shotgun (due for a release this year). Unfortunately, Machete lacks the feel of a true exploitation film for two reasons. One, it uses big name actors like Lindsay Lohan and Robert De Niro. Having them in a movie trying to pass off as ""an underground, exploitation film"" is a little strange. It's also not shot with added film grain like Planet Terror and Death Proof. That alone is disappointing. The trailer of the film teases you because it shows the film in a grainy texture. What a letdown.The plot: Machete Cortez (Trejo) is an illegal immigrant ass-kicker who is now hopelessly roaming the streets of Texas three years after a drug lord killed his entire family. Michael Booth (Jeff Fahey) is a business man in Texas who offers to pay Machete $150,000 to assassinate John McLaughlin (De Niro), a Texas State Senator. After a sniper bullet wound interferes with Machete's plans, Machete now must escape the cops and is now on the run to expose McLaughlin since his plans to close the Mexican borders are utterly extreme and must have some purpose greater than what he says. Machete tries to recruit his now pacifist ex-partner Padre (Marin) to help him out as well as working with Agent Sartana Rivera (Alba).Danny Trejo is the only person who could play Machete will full force. Trejo has virtually one facial expression the whole film and knows how to pick a bone better than many actors in the movies today.Machete also holds the ball on one of the funniest action scenes in recent years. In a hospital, Machete rips a man's small intestine out of his stomach using a sharp blade and swings to a lower level room using it. It's a scene that is hard to explain, but needs to be watched.Characters like Cheech Marin and Lindsay Lohan do not have as big of a role in the film as the trailer falsely states. I would've loved to see more of Cheech, and maybe some scenes of him and Machete kicking ass around town. That's the kind of thing I wish the film hadn't left out.It's hard to believe the cold-hearted Machete character was born in the 2001 kids adventure film Spy Kids (also directed by Rodriguez). Daryl Sabara, who portrayed Juni Cortez in the Spy Kids films, had a cameo in this film. It's nice to see him all grown up in this film, it's not so nice to see him in Spy Kids 4: All the Time in the World due for a release this year.Death Proof still stands as my favorite Grindhouse film of the franchise. Machete is a good film and a great tribute to it's respective genre. But the lack of film grain and the big name actors deteriorate from what it's trying to be. It isn't all that it could've been, but it's a damn good action flick in its own right.Starring: Danny Trejo, Cheech Marin, Lindsay Lohan, Jeff Fahey, and Robert De Niro. Directed by: Robert Rodriguez.",Machete

39,KineticSeoul,Pretty good gratuitous violence,6,7 October 2010,"After watching ""Grindhouse"" I was wondering if they were actually going to make a full feature film with the fake trailers. And to my surprise here comes ""Machete"" in theaters. Now some people that is really strict on border control and hate illegal immigrants will probably be angered by this film. I didn't really care about that issue as much, so I enjoyed this film for what it is. Now I am not sure if this film counts as a real exploitation film, but it does have a lot of wacky scenes and some shock factor to it and enough nudity and violence to get my interest...Well at least for the most part. I could sort of tell what type of movie I was in for when Machete starts out on a rescue mission and finds the girl fully naked, played by Mayra Leal who is credited as the Naked Girl. Now if your looking for some gratuitous gore, gratuitous violence, gratuitous dialog, this film is for you. And it does have some crazy scenes with machete using a guys intestines to repel down a building and crash through and window and other stuff along that line. I personally liked this movie, but wished it was Grindhouse 2. With it being a double feature films in one kinda deal than it would have probably been a most definite worthy of the price of admission. Another flaw is, the action sequences just wasn't that creative or well done in my opinion and sort of dull at times. So although I like this movie, it ain't really worth going all the way out to theater to see, but a pretty darn good rent.6.8/10",Machete
40,Hellmant,'MACHETE' don't text!,10,7 September 2010,"'MACHETE': Five Stars (Out of Five) The long awaited feature film based on writer / director Robert Rodriguez's beloved 'fake' trailer 'MACHETE' is finally here and it doesn't disappoint. The trailer was featured prior to Rodriguez's entry 'PLANET TERROR' in his and buddy Quentin Tarantino's 'GRINDHOUSE' double feature from 2007. These films are designed to imitate the popular 'B' exploitation films of the 70's and 80's that were typically played at rundown theaters known as 'grindhouses'. 'MACHETE' is an homage to 'Mexploitation' films and was originally conceived as just a satirical trailer but later evolved into a full feature length film due to it's popularity. Writer / director Eli Roth's fake trailer 'THANKSGIVING' is also rumored to be developed in to a full feature. Rodriguez supposedly filmed half of the movie while he was making the trailer and Jeff Fahey, Cheech Marin and Danny Trejo all reprise their roles from it (This is actually Trejo's fifth time playing the 'Machete' character, he also played him in all three 'SPY KIDS' films). Rodriguez credits his buddy Ethan Maniquis as a co-director on the film and cousin Alvaro as a co-writer.Long time character actor 'tough guy' Danny Trejo finally gets his first starring role, at age 66! He plays the iconic 'Machete', an ex Federale who as the film opens is betrayed by his boss and ex-partner Torrez (played by none other than Steven Seagal), who's now a vicious drug lord. His wife and daughter are murdered and he's left for dead. Three years later he's now an illegal immigrant looking for day labor in Texas. He's discovered by a businessman named Booth (Fahey) and hired to assassinate a Senator (played by Robert De Niro) who's radical illegal immigration stance is seen as bad for business. He's betrayed by his employers though and now a wanted fugitive. This of course turns into a very violent revenge tale as Machete teams up with a beautiful ICE agent (played by Jessica Alba), a tough resistance fighter (played by Michelle Rodriguez) and his brother who's now a priest (played by Cheech Marin).The film is packed with gruesome and over the top violence as well as the prerequisite explicit sex and nudity these films are known for. It's also full of witty and humorous dialog (including my favorite line 'Machete don't text') as well as a surprising amount of social and political commentary. This movie actually has a heart and an important message behind it's rough and tough exterior. It's nothing short of a masterpiece in my opinion. I love these types of movies. Rodriguez is one of my favorite directors (and writers) although I'm not a big fan of his kids' films; I love almost everything else he does though. In my opinion he's up there with Quentin Tarantino, Sam Raimi, Peter Jackson, Kevin Smith, etc. He's one of the great ones and this film is as well. It's everything I expected; a beautiful homage to 70's and 80's B action films.

41,thesar-2,What ever happened to Don't or THANKSGIVING?,8,26 September 2010,"Despite the length, I really enjoyed the Grindhouse double feature, but I loved the first of two films, Planet Terror more. And best of all, were the faux-pas commercials; Thanksgiving and Don't were my favorite.Sure, the Machete preview was entertaining, and I was thinking back in 2007 that I wouldn't mind seeing a feature length version with one of my all-time favorite character-actors, Danny Trejo, but again, low-budget horror like Thanksgiving – a holiday they eerily haven't made a horror movie about, would've scared the blank out of me.But, I digress, they started (and unfortunately, probably finished) with Machete which is, as a whole, as entertaining as Robert Rodriguez's other Grindhouse feature, Planet Terror. So, if you liked those kinds of features, definitely see this one. Otherwise, you'll probably be completely turned off to the enormously, but funny, fake blood, bad albeit hilarious, dialogue, implausible actions, improbable sexual encounters and predictable outcomes. And you know what? That's all part of the charm and fun.Machete, (Trejo) the best of the best assassins, is courted to kill a Congressman (De Niro) but is, gasp!, betrayed and wanders around until he can solve the crime and possibly clear his name in the process, although that doesn't interest him. He's superhuman. He don't care about nobody!Superhuman is right. I lost count on how many times he dies in this movie. But when his brother the Padre (Marin) gets hung up, literally – close your eyes, Catholics, he's OUT FOR REVENGE.Let's throw in some lovely ladies to aid in his quest, Jessica Alba as Sartana and Michelle Rodriguez as Luz, some questionable ones, such as a fully nude Lindsey Lohan – at least she had a good reason for missing her court hearings. Also Don Johnson, as the eeeevil Sheriff and an out-of-character, for Steven Seagal, ""BAD"" guy Torrez all for good measure.On a side note, I live in Arizona, and publicity hound Sheriff Joe Arpaio, was questioned by the media – we have the absolute worst here, if the eeeevil Sheriff portrayed in the movie that actually shoots dead a pregnant illegal immigrant resembles himself in real life. After seeing it, it's truly apples/oranges, at least in my opinion. Personally, I can't stand the big-ego, big-talk Arpaio, but I can't see him, or just about anyone doing that. If they truly meant that his character mimicked Joey, then it was definitely done maliciously and there are far better ways to get your point across.At any rate, like I said, the movie on the whole is wildly entertaining and a lot of fun, especially on how fake everything looks, including how it was shot. The biggest problem, yes, aside from Lohan, is the movie tends to fall completely and utterly apart in the last third. The plot starts going in so many different directions, it's almost as if a completely separate movie started up when you were already used to Machete's tale.This might have been done intentionally, as a friend of mine pointed out, but I didn't feel that way. Planet Terror certainly did not – it stayed right on track to the exciting finale. Luckily, Machete did contain the same type of thrilling climax, not to say it got back on track; it just showed what audiences came for. More Camp, More Blood, More Boobs.Though it is sad how the movie crumbled just when it was getting good, as if they simply just ran out of ideas – it was based on a fake 2-minute preview, after all – but on a whole, it's wholeheartedly recommended. And nowonto Don't and Thanksgiving! Bring it!",Machete
42,bensonmum2,"""God has mercy. I don't!""",9,2 July 2015,"I'm really not sure where to begin. Let's just skip the the normal plot summary. Suffice it to say that Machete looks for revenge on those who killed his family and, then, set him up. But the plot hardly matters. Machete has got so much going on, so much coolness, so much violence, so much action . . . I'm not sure I can do it justice. I can't, so I'll just mention a few things that I really like.First, the cast. When I read the list of actors in Machete to my wife, she thought I was on drugs. In addition to Danny Trejo, there's Jessica Alba, Don Johnson, Robert De Niro (yeah, freakin' Robert De Niro), Cheech Marin, Michelle Rodriguez (mmmmm), Lindsay Lohan, Steven Segal, and more. And one of the cool things, they all look like they're having fun.Second, action. Other than one or two places in he script, Machete never slows down. Most of it is like riding a roller coaster. Fights, chases, explosions, heads rolling, blood . . . it's got it all. A couple of my favorite moments include Machete riding that motorcycle with guns blazing and Machete swinging from one floor of a building to the next using some guy's intestines. Good stuff!Third, Robert Rodriguez. While I've always enjoyed his work, it's only recently that I've realized how much. From Desperado to Spy Kids to Machete, his films have a look and style that appeals to me. I'm really looking forward to see where his career leads. I'm not stupid and I realize that Machete is not a movie that will work with everyone (my wife thought it was ridiculous). I understand its critics and their issues. Machete is one of those movies that really shows how I rate movies. For me, ratings are all about entertainment. And Machete entertained me like few recent movies have. A 9/10 from me.",Machete
43,Robert_duder,"For the fans, keeps the Grindhouse genre alive",7,8 August 2011,"I really waited a lonnnng time to see Machete. I don't know why really other than I kept hoping to buy it fairly cheap and then finally it showed up on Netflix. I suppose I had a lot of high hopes for it given how much I absolutely loved Grindhouse in its entirety and in certain aspects it does live up to expectations. I felt like perhaps there was some flaws in the overall product that could have been avoided but it really does give exactly what you would expect. Anyone who loves Robert Rodriguez or Danny Trejo (who certainly has a cult following), or Grindhouse, this is a must see. If you don't enjoy one of those things or even know what they are...Machete will seem like utter garbage to you. The violence, sex, and vengeance is dished out fluently, all set to that grainy quality of film that Grindhouse gave us. The strange thing about Machete is how little character development is really given to Machete. I expect in a film like this that the namesake of the film would be in your face, over the top, ball-busting, bad ass and he is that at times but not consistently throughout the whole film. It might seem weird to say this but the story and the supporting characters sort of got in the way.Every movie fan knows Danny Trejo. Is there anything he hasn't done? At an astonishing 66 years old, the man barely looks 50 and pulls off the action role flawlessly. Would you ever call Danny Trejo an old man? He seduces, has sex, and rips apart bad guys in a single swoop and is reminiscent of classic action stars of the 80's and 90's like Stallone, Willis, or Schwarzenegger. The incomparable Robert Deniro is sort of laughable and silly but still a welcome addition to the cast as the twisted Senator. Jessica Alba is sexy but not much else as the Immigration officer teamed up with Machete. They try to work in some silly romantic angle between them but Alba is sort of boring in her role. Michelle Rodriguez gives one of the best supporting roles in the film as Mexican Saviour Luz. Ironically in this type of film she gives one of her softer performances but still kicks butt when she needs to. Lindsay Lohan gives a small and mostly pointless performance and I'm not on the Lohan hate waggon, I actually respect her as an actress mostly but they give her very little in this. Other supporting stars that are given perhaps too much attention including Jeff Fahey (loved him on Lost), Cheech Marin as a potentially great character that is sort of wasted, and Don Johnson who is hardly in the film. And it definitely was fun to have Steven Seagal as the baddie in the film although most of his work is done via satellite to his henchman (Fahey.) It would have been great to see an epic battle between Trejo and Seagal.One thing Machete will be known for is some truly incredible and bloody death scenes. For a knock off of a 70's exploitation film it does perfectly and then you have some truly disturbing scenes like Cheech Marin being crucified by Jeff Fahey...where else could you see that? Robert Rodriguez is a bizarre director and film creator, and his diversity is even more bizarre...from Spy Kids, to this, and then back to Spy Kids again? But he knows how to entertain and he knows what he likes and you either like his work or you don't. It is easy to see why him and Taratino get along so well because they certainly do enjoy their unique brand of crazy film making that make some shudder and jaws drop open but man can they tell a story. Rumors abound of Machete being made into a trilogy and I am all for that idea. Hopefully Trejo and Rodriguez will find a groove where we can really sink into the character. See it if its up your alley, plain and simple. 7/10",Machete
44,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,Worthy enough big screen adaptation of Grindhouse trailer,7,22 May 2011,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Mexican Federale Machete (Danny Trejo) embarks on a suicide mission in his native Mexico against drug lord Torrez (Steven Seagal), who has bribed every law enforcement agency under the sun. The mission fails, and the fire of vengeance is left burning in Machete's heart when Torrez kills his wife. Years later, he's working as an illegal immigrant in the US, ever under the thumb of Border Patrol cop Sartana (Jessica Alba), until Government Agent Booth (Jeff Fahey) forces him into a corner and assigns him to take out Senator McLoughlin (Robert De Niro), an anti immigrant election candidate who wants to build a giant electric fence to stop Mexicans crossing the border. He goes ahead, but finds himself set up before he can go through with his mission. And when he learns who is helping McLoughlin for funding with his fence, it sets Machete on a double mission of retribution.Adapted as a film from the very unusual medium of a fake trailer in another film, Machete has proved to be even more of a success than it's inspirational source. Inspired by the Quentin Tarantino started craze of 1970s 'Grindhouse' themed movies currently enjoying a cult appreciation in the theatres, it itself does away with too much of the cackling screen and shoddy film-reeling, and plays like more of a modern, straight up action film, albeit one with more of an intricate story with a bit of depth to it. That said, when the action scenes do come on, they are delivered with the flair and style that's required, including a fantastic finale, with guns blazing everywhere and explosions galore. Aside from this, with Robert Rodriguez as one of the directors, you can be guaranteed a lot of the action will be of the blood letting variety, and there's plenty of that here, including a man's intestines being used by our hero to swing from a building to the ground below! Some of the cast do better than others. In the main lot, De Niro delivers what is becoming an ever increasingly apathetic performance as the villainous senator, while Fahey as the corrupt agent mumbles relentlessly and delivers all the facial emotion of a dead fish. But the side is saved by Seagal, surprisingly effective in the first villainous role I've seen him in, though his end showdown with Machete isn't the sum of it's parts thanks to him now being far too badly out of shape. But best of all is Trejo as the titular Federale, the meanest Mexicano anti-hero since El Mariachi, in a role he was born to play. That's not to mention a support cast that ranges from the likes of Michelle Rodriguez and Don Johnson to the likes of Lindsay Lohan, which should give you some indication of the quality range on offer.This enjoyed a fairly hasty exit from UK cinemas, which is a shame, as despite not being an unforgettable action film, it's still one of the better ones to have come out in a while. ***",Machete
45,bowmanblue,Just soooo much fun!,9,4 February 2019,"Where do I begin with this movie? Perhaps the title? 'Machete' is a simple enough name for a film that, despite what it appears at first glance, is not that simple. It started life as a 'mock trailer' made as part of a homage to a pair of 'Grindhouse' films by Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez ('Death Proof' and 'Planet Terror') and, no, I've never heard of 'Grindhouse' until those films! Anyway, I digress... 'Machete' was a trailer advertising an insanely powerful Mexican anti-hero (Danny Trejo) by the name of 'Machete' who happily blasts his way through wave upon wave of faceless henchmen in the most gory and over-the-top fashion possible.In short, it hardly took itself seriously, knowing that it was completely unbelievable and deliberately gory, with plenty of cheesy one-liners and, well, over-the-top action. In fact... 'over-the-top' was its byword. And, despite 'Death Proof' and 'Planet Terror' being successes in their own right (my personal favourite being 'Planet Terror') it seemed that there was an appetite to adapt the trailer into a full-length feature. And here's the result.Danny Trejo is hardly a 'household' name, but that's nothing new in B-movies. However, what is different is the amount of big names the script has attracted. If ever there was a measure as to whether a script was any good, it's whether it can attract A-list stars. It's hard to believe that Robert DeNiro is in this - granted he only pops up here and there, but he's clearly enjoying the ride, as are the rest of the cast. Expect to see Jessica Alba, Michelle Rodriguez and Steven Seagal all doing their bit to aid or hamper Machete's quest to take down a ruthless gang of armed thugs who want to gun down Mexican migrants as they make their way to America.If ever a film captured the sheer essence of the trailer then 'Machete' is a perfect example. If you love B-movies that refuse to take themselves seriously, then 'Machete' is for you. It's wonderfully exaggerated and full of gore, violence, nudity and profanity. So, if any of those things offends you then you're better off steering clear. If you're unsure as to whether or not you'll like it, track down the original trailer (probably available for free on YouTube) and, if it tickles your fancy, then you'll definitely enjoy the 'real thing' (and the sequel - that's pretty damn fine, too). Just wondering where the final chapter of the trilogy is these days?",Machete
46,dromasca,blood border,5,2 December 2012,"Action movies are one of my not so secret guilty pleasures and I do not even feel so guilty since directors in the genre get recognition not only from audiences but also from critics, and the genre is celebrated at Cannes and becomes vehicle in expressing universal emotions and making political statements as any other respected cinema genre. Then Machete has Robert De Niro on the generic, yes it's Robert De Niro AND Steven Seagal, but then the getting together of Robert De Niro and Steven Seagal should not seem that odd nowadays.What is Machete about? Bad guys hire a retired Mexican cop to assassinate a Senator (despicable figure, by the way) in a border town in Texas, where illegal traffic or anything is the law in the absence of the rule of law. When he understands the plot literally in the last fraction of second and survives the tentative to assassinate the assassin, the former cop turns from a killing machine on the bad side into a killing machine on the good side. It is really hard to say where are in Machete directed by Ethan Maniquis and Robert Rodriguez the borders between action film and parody, between the tentative to make a political statement and the need to pace the screening time with corpses. It would not have counted too much if some kind of balance would have been kept, but this is not the case here, and the result is that any minute of the film is filled with pure violence or physical comedy gags, and anything else seems to be left aside.The really good achievements of the film seem to be the choreographed violent scenes and the acting of Danny Trejo and Michelle Rodriguez who feel completely at ease in the extreme environment of the film. To say that De Niro is a miscast is an understatement, there may be reasons for him to act in this genre of films, but they escape me, excepting the obvious one, but if you are DeNiro you should be able to pick better. Overall Machete seems to be another victim of the bloody Southern border.",Machete

Robert De Niro is a senator that shoots illegals for fun; as if any senator would ever do that.The plot is the senator's adviser, Booth, hires Machete to kill the senator, but it is a setup. He just wants it to look like a Mexican was trying to kill the senator in order to get more people to agree with the issue of getting illegals out of Texas. So Machete is out to get him back, the senator, and the drug lord that killed his wife.

This movie did not fare well at the box office but it's destined to become a cult favorite.This is about a Mexican dude who's been double-crossed. He's being framed for the assassination for a Texas senator who hates illegal immigrants. Now Machete will do all in his power to clear his name.The acting is very good. I am happy that Danny Trejo is finally a lead character. Of course the beautiful Jessica Alba is great eye candy. I could say the same about Michelle Rodriguez.

51,CuriosityKilledShawn,Absolutely horrendous,1,13 October 2013,"I've never been a fan of Robert Rodriguez, and I am not sure his fanbase are aware of the amateurish nature of virtually everything he has made. In the nearly 20 years he has been making movies he's never graduated to being a serious filmmaker. His pal Tarantino is lights years ahead of him.This piece of crap movie was born out of the fake trailer between the movies of full ""Grindhouse"" experience a few years back. Remember that notorious bomb that nearly crippled Harvey Weinstein? Only the movie isn't really Grindhouse. The fake dirt and scratches laid over the opening scene disappear after the credits, and it looks like any old generic TV show for the most part with bland photography. If it kept up the dirt and scratches aesthetic, however fake, I would have respected it just a tiny little bit more.It's not a Grindhouse film, it doesn't have the balls to be. It's just a cheap, amateurish killing spree with lots of fake, CGI blood and boring characters. I assume Rodriguez has dirt or incriminating Polaroid's on absolutely every member of the cast as I can't think of any reason why anyone would willfully agree to be in this abortion. I wouldn't have this garbage listed on my filmography. I wouldn't even want it listed on my toilet paper.Don't get me wrong, I like Danny Trejo and I LOVE Michelle Rodriguez, but this film was so bad that upon watching it a second time I actually found myself reading a factual book halfway through as it was rotting my brain that much.It's an angry 15-year-old's wet dream.

I will admit going in the only reason I wanted to watch this was because De Niro was in it and it seemed like a strange choice for him. After sitting through this I decided to send him 5 bucks...he obviously needs the money if this is the kind of work he is taking. At the risk of losing money and comments I may receive, this movie was lame. The best explanation I can give is that it's 1 hour and 45 minutes of blood splatters mixed with some nudity. I like a good mindless flick now and then but this was just bad. It's hard to comment on the acting, it has an all-star cast including Jessica Alba, Michelle Rodriguez, Don Johnson, Steven Seagal, Cheech and Lindsay Lohan, but the writing was so bad even De Niro seemed like a B rate actor.

53,callanvass,I enjoyed it,7,21 March 2014,"After Machete is left for dead by the evil Rogeilo Torrez, Machete plays it low-key for a while. Senator (DeNiro) John McLaughlin is campaigning to be re-elected with a vendetta against immigrants. When Machete is offered a large sum of money to assassinate the senator, he gets set-up. Refusing to let this go quietly, he go on a warpath of revenge. I thought the trailer was very cool, but I didn't think it would amount to anything, let alone a movie. This is nothing more than a glorified B movie that is very exploitation heavy. That being said, it's a pretty good one. This is drive in fodder. I especially enjoyed Robert Rodriguez's touch by making the movie look grainy and cheap. It all worked, and very effectively at that. The violence is insane in this movie. Yes, it's filled with CGI. But that doesn't mean I wasn't wowed by the violence factor. At just over two minutes in, the violence starts. Have you ever seen anybody use somebody's innards as a rope to get out of a window? That's just a small example of the violence you'll see. The unabashed style serves this movie well. As fun as this movie is, you can thank the amazing cast for that. Danny Trejo has been a great character actor over the years, but he's the lead in this movie. He's a blast to watch and played a great anti-hero. DeNiro is fun as the vindictive senator. Steven Seagal is actually good as a villain. Oddly enough, he turned down Jackie Chan for a villain role in Rush Hour 3. Lame accent aside, he was fun, and he looked motivated for once. Jeff Fahey was fantastic! I was so happy to see this talented man get a substantial part in a Hollywood picture again. He's WAY too talented to be languishing in STD drivel like he is these days. Jessica Alba isn't great acting wise, but does it matter? She's amazing eye-candy, I'm not gonna complain. Michelle Rodriguez does what she does best, play a bad- ass. Lindsey Lohan shows semblance of what she once was. It was fun to see her kick ass in a nun outfit. Marin, Johnson & Savini are fun as well. This is just a fun way to pass a 105 minutes or so. It's one of the rare times where the running time doesn't wear out its welcome with a film like this. Action fans or exploitation fans will like this one.

Ironically, by starring in a major motion picture, the Mexican lead has now become a myth himself. (Green Light)",Machete
55,ironhorse_iv,"Machete might not be cutting edge. However, it's a fun throwback to the B movie and exploitation style of the 1970s.",6,21 February 2017,"The story of how 'Machete' got produce is a very interesting story & no, it didn't all started with the praise by audience members after seeing the fake trailer that was included in director Robert Rodriguez's and Quentin Tarantino's 2007 co-produce film 'Grindhouse' double-feature. Instead, it all began with director Robert Rodriguez meeting star, Danny Trejo on the set of 1995's 'Desperado'. As you see, it's there, that the director first create the character of Machete, by believing that Danny Trejo could be the next big 'Mexican action star'. It just took, many years for that idea to take hold. Finally in 2010, this mexploitation film was indeed made with the blessing from 20th century Fox. Inspire by John Woo's 1992 film 'Hard Boiled' and his 1989 movie, 'The Killer', the film tells the story of ex-Mexican federal, Isador 'Machete' Cortez (Danny Trejo), being hired to assassinate the anti-illegal immigration politician John McLaughlin (Robert De Niro), only to betrayed by Michael Booth (Jeff Fahey), a local businessman that hired him. Without spoiling the movie, too much, while this movie seems like Danny Trejo's first movie as Machete Cortez; in truth, this was his fifth appearance. The first appearance was in 2001's 'Spy Kids', followed up with its sequels. While, it's nice to see him, back in the role. It's just a bit bizarre to see how his kid-friendly character of the same name has nothing in common with this adult-driven character. They even have different backstory and family connections. Are they twins? Are they clones? Did one of them, stole the other person identify!? Sadly, Rodriquez never truly explain why, he has Danny Trejo played two different characters with the same name. Despite that, I did think Trejo did a great job as the titular character. He was pretty quick at his age, during most of the ridiculous action scenes, even if it's fake looking, heavily choreograph & staged. I can't say the same with the villain of the picture, drug lord, Rogelio Torrez (Steven Seagal). Seagal can barely move, when fighting with Machete. It's clear to me, that he hasn't work out much, since, his last movie 2002's 'Half Past Dead'. He was so old. It was painful to watch. Even his fake Mexican accent was a turn off. He didn't even try. I would rather see, Von Jackson (Don Johnson) or Osiris Amanpour (Tom Savini) as the main villain. Two great performers that seems to misused in their roles. Another performer in this film that irritated me, was Lindsay Lohan as April; Booth's drug-fuel daughter. Not only, was her performance, underwhelming, but her annoying character sure, wasn't needed. Also, it's probably, not the best thing by the casting director, to have Lohan play a drug addict, seeing how she been put on probation. Her acting was dry and emotionless. Unlike her, surprising, most of the rest of female cast was alright. It really surprised me, because normally, I don't think, Jessica Alba and Michelle Rodriquez as good actresses, but somehow, they prove me, wrong as Agent Sartana and Luz. Still, I just glad, Rodriquez cut the slutty identical twin sister, also played by Jessica Alba and Boots McCoy played by Rose McGowan. Three awful actresses would be too much for me, to handle. Nevertheless, if I had to choose one actor that really shine in this film; it would probably be Cheech Marin as Padre Benicio Del Toro. Yes, Marin has only a couple of minutes of screen time, but he manages to steal every scene. He had some of the best one-liners, besides Machete's 'don't text' quote. In the end, the movie had mostly a very impressive cast for an insanely over the top action film. However, they might had overdo it with flying gore, and graphic nudity. Don't get me wrong, I like sex & violence as any other man does, but it comes CGI. I kinda like it, to look kinda real. It was just awkward, that Alba had a shower scene where the crew just etched out, her underwear to make it seem like she was nude. Also, the CGI blood being splattered into the camera direction, got a bit annoying. Another, is the odd choice of sound effects. It doesn't match, what is happening on screen, at times. To be fair, the amateurish nature of virtually everything was deliberate to look, sound, and be funny. Still, there were a few things that they could had cut, because how pointless and unfunny, they were. Those are just examples. Its reasons, like these, is why the 2013's sequel, 'Machete Kills', underperform. Overall: While, 'Machete Kills' was a disappointment. In the end, 'Machete' is still one of the most quintessential exploitation action flick parody of the early '10s. It's hilarious entertaining to a point. A must watch for anybody that love cheesy action films.",Machete
56,The-Sarkologist,Just To Think this Film Started as a Mock Preview,8,12 September 2013,"Now this one one violent movie, but then what do you expect when Robert Rodriguez creates a movie about an ex-Federale who's weapon of choice, and name, is Machete. This becomes quite clear in the first few minutes of the movie when Machete storms the house of a drug lord and proceeds to hack the occupants to pieces with his machete.Despite the violence, I did really enjoy this movie, or was it because of the violence, I really don't know. Still it was a fun movie. Not one with any deep or meaningful themes, rather is was the standard story of a ex-cop (or Federale, which is the Mexican version of the FBI) who decides to stand up against corruption and the drug lords in Mexico, but when he is captured and left for dead, he sneaks over the boarder to the USA where he starts his life anew as an immigrant worker. However, he is recognised, and soon he finds that he must confront his demons (not that they are necessary demons as Machete is one tough hombre), and then go and deal with the head drug lord, who happens to be a very old Steven Segal (see, he isn't immune to age – if you don't get this, have a look at some of the demotivational posters).The storyline actually isn't all that bad either, because being an immigrant worker, the criminal underworld in the US see him as some expendable Mexican, so they hire him to assassinate an annoying senator, and when he does so, he discovers that he isn't actually the triggerman, but rather somebody else is, and he is simply being framed because it is the senator's anti-immigration stance that is upsetting the crims (namely because it means that it will be a lot more difficult for them to import drugs into the US). If there is one person who seems to be immune to death, it is Machete, particularly since he takes a bullet in the head, and survives, and then takes another bullet, which bounces off the first one.Cool movie, heaps cool movie, but for the violence, of course.",Machete

The film has a great cast and it exceeds at that. The film isn't for everyone but for those whom are fans of Robert Rodriguez will probably enjoy it. Machete was some pretty funny death scenes nice action throughout. Though the film starts out pretty good (very good first 5 mins before title screen), then becomes slower around the second half (once Jessica Alba's character becomes more a presence). The ending was predictable, the villains end up dying while the Mexican's end up being happy and standing their ground.

61,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Although it hits a plateau, Rodriguez and a wild cast make for good fun",6,11 February 2011,"Few films can brag that they were adapted from a fake grindhouse movie trailer, which is exactly what makes ""Machete"" special. Few filmmakers can pull off an exploitation flick quite like Robert Rodriguez and although ""Machete"" will never be a cult classic, Rodriguez is to thank for helping popularize this often laughed-at sub-genre. There are a growing number of movie fans who enjoy mindless films that don't take themselves seriously and ""Machete"" is one of the leaders in this revolution.Rodriguez is notorious for developing long-standing working relationships with a number of his actors and ""Machete"" serves as a good chance to give them some work. One of his best friends in that regard, Danny Trejo, gets his first huge starring role as Machete Cortez, a federale whose high sense of honor led him to a betrayal and the death of his wife at the hands of Mexican drug kingpin Torrez (Steven Seagal). Fast forward three years later and Machete lives in Texas as your typical illegal day laborer, although he misses his blade dearly. When a man named booth (Jeff Fahey) pulls him off the street and tells him he'll get $150 K if he assassinates a local anti-immigration senator (Robert De Niro). Machete nods silently in agreement, but the job was a setup and Machete must go on the run from a corrupt politician in addition to an ambitious immigration officer (Jessica Alba).How often do you get a cast that includes Alba, De Niro and Seagal? It's more mind-blowing when you mention the rest of the cast: Michelle Rodriguez, Cheech Marin, Don Johnson and Lindsay Lohan. The eclectic cast makes ""Machete"" that much more interesting of a watch.The film roars off to a gory and delightfully cheesy start that includes slicing, dicing and Machete carrying a naked girl over his shoulder. The setup of the film's events surprises in terms of being equally amusing and slightly intriguing. The script does a really nice job capturing our interest that the moment of obnoxious mayhem comes as a bit of a surprise. But after a scene in which Machete is taken to a hospital in critical condition, rips off tubing and then slices some guys up with surgical tools (followed by a window escape using a man's intestines as a rappelling rope), ""Machete"" hits a plateau. Despite some funny moments, ""Machete"" fails to surprise us and gets a bit lost in illegal immigration satire. The political agenda is held up by Alba's character and sadly, the girl can't even act dramatically when the film she is in is a joke. It's painful watching her try to act not so seriously -- I've given up hope on her credibility as an actress unless she's in something melodramatic with fight scenes.It's hard to tell exactly how ""Machete"" loses some of its luster, but the events and the techniques simply become predictable, even if they're as over-the-top as when Machete's brother, a gun-toting priest played by Marin, gets nailed to a cross. Although amusing, it doesn't take us by surprise. Even the final battle royale against a bunch of ""wetback haters"" doesn't take the film to the next level as the buildup drags and the payoff is unclever carnage. The only strengths in the end are the carefully orchestrated deaths that exploitation films are known for: giving the bad guys what they deserve.Rodriguez definitely intended, for the sake of the genre, to beat us over the head with visual clues as to what ridiculousness will happen next, but rather than play it up, it stays a bit subtle and the anticipation isn't there. By the climax, the film has become a tiresome exercise in poor visual effects and reprises of previous techniques. However, only Rodriguez could assemble the cast and dream big enough to make a B-movie with an ""A"" feel.~Steven C",Machete
62,jzappa,Trejo is Allowed Little Range by a Director With Less,6,20 October 2010,"No filmmaker can make me feel like an idiot like Robert Rodriguez. This, you don't know how it shames me to say, is the third time I've left a Rodriguez film baffled that I went of my own accord in the first place. I pride myself on my taste in cinema. You don't have to agree with me, but the fact is that friends are constantly asking me what good movies I've seen lately, whether or not they should see certain movies, because they value my opinion of movies a great deal. Movies are what I do with my life. I'm constantly seeking better, more awe-inspiring and artistic films each time I see one. And I willingly pay money to see Machete, a movie which I positively should've known would be a tedious, mindless waste of its somewhat appealing concept? Why did I do that? Again? I don't like Rodriguez's movies. I think they're all ultimately very shallow, silly, indiscriminate, jumbled, to say the least. In doubtful times, the media's surveillance function often labels groups seen as potential threats. We did it to Japanese citizens in WWII, Arabs and Muslims after 9/11. We think gays getting married will devalue our own marriages. We equate black neighborhoods with dangerous ones. Hispanics get a similar bad rep in America because we feel the more of them immigrate, the less jobs, cars, etc. for us. I was drawn to Machete, in part, because of its attempt to do what more American films should, correlating different social aspects in response to the true threats affecting the culture's value position.Alas, after letting us know, via funky tell-tale scoring, phony celluloid scratches, that this will be yet another simulated '70s exploitation picture, Rodriguez strives for the lowest common denominator purely because it's fun and because he's unilaterally interested in the thrill of the technical process as opposed to the creative or aesthetic value of that result. I think I was anxious to see this pinnacle of Rodriguez nonsense because judging by its trailer, cast, topicality, I figured it would be self-ironic. But instead it's self-shitty. Rodriguez is famous for always working on shoestrings to inspire more creativity. Name one sign of that here, one remote use of creativity. I'll give you $100.""I don't go to these kinds of movies for any intellectual or philosophical content. I go to see stuff blow up and bad guys get theirs."" Same here! I still hated it! ""It's an ode to the old grindhouse pictures."" OK, fine. You know, creativity means having to use your head a little to embrace what's happening on screen. I apologize for thinking that something interesting should happen, that any suspense should be built or actual relationships should form. But no, people get killed, so you're happy because you didn't have to ""think."" Good for you! Millions of dollars were spent to constructnothing! Maybe an allusion to how right-wing politics poison living conditions and equality. Yet ironically, I see how Rodriguez reinforcing grotesque, exploitative stereotypes of his own ethnicity means little to nothing to him at all, because they're shooting, stabbing, setting afire people who are against them, so it's OK that essentially every single Hispanic person here is directly involved in heartlessly slaying countless people whenever, wherever, however, and that's the end of it. No other consequences.Women are only bimbos here. Tough, hard-hitting bimbos who can fight. But bimbos nevertheless. They're not allowed to be actual characters. Are there movies I like that are basically male shoot-em-ups wherein women are only there to be idealized from the perspective of a masculinity complex? Hell yes. Every Bond film. But if you're here for the same reasons quoted above, you won't see Jessica Alba and Michelle Rodriguez as anything but their skin-tight, curve-accentuating clothing suggests. But what am I saying? Just because many brainless male-driven actioners like this portray women this way doesn't mean that this one's the same: Every single character in this movie, man or woman, performed with a touch of charm or not, is nothing but an oversimplification designed to either kill or be killed, mostly the latter, the least interesting of whom the former, and nobody in between.Is it too harsh to say that seeing this movie charred a black, irreconcilable gulch across my mind, as it's upset the murky trenches of my psyche? Maybe, because that's savage criticism to an almost substandard degree. But what I'm dead serious about is this film being---above all, more importantly than my own personal distaste for this no-brainer kind of movie and the mindless self-indulgence of the dick-swinging jerk-off muscle-flexing wet dream that it is---principally, a come-stain on the velvet sheet of Robert De Niro's filmography. In a lot of filmwork wherein he lacks creative control, the other performances really aren't his concern. If the other actor isn't giving him what he needs, he acts as though he were, which doesn't work for very long in this case. I don't have to tell anybody this man's credentials, how he's changed the face of acting for the camera forever. And nevertheless, he's here, playing the most interesting character in the movie, relegated to the most violated. He as the villain, as well as the most talented and distinguished star of the entire star-studded cast of mostly B-movie schlock hams, is the least well-handled of Rodriguez's in the entire cast. That's a hard competition.If I were president of Hollywood, I'd sanction Rodriguez's expatriation gladly, without remorse. The fact that his output is slowing down anyway is a plus. But the fact that I'm not and never will be president of Hollywood can only be compensated by my vow to never see anything by this boorish, puerile, immature hack ever again in my life. Done talking about him too. Bye.",Machete
63,Vartiainen,"Brawn over brains, but in a good way",5,27 December 2013,"One of the funnier action comedies in a long time, Machete delivers exactly what it promises. A big burly Mexican effortlessly reaping his way through countless opponents while beautiful women trample over each other to receive the honor off throwing themselves at him like cheap confetti. This is purely a popcorn flick, no brains or logical thought required. And for what it is, it's very good.Though I must admit that I've never found Danny Trejo to be that funny, especially in a leading role. He's fine when all you need is a scary-looking dude to kill things imaginatively, and his straight man routine works most of the time, but he would have been more suited to the role of a lead side character. Having him as your main character means that all the jokes he participates in have to be of the same variety, which is a shame.Aside from him, I liked most of the main actor. Michelle Rodriguez is still as great as ever, as is Robert De Niro. This isn't Jessica Alba's finest role, I must admit, but she's mainly there to be eye candy anyway, so I'm not complaining that much. The same applies to Lindsey Lohan, though Alba's role is a bit more of a disappointment, because the movie actually tries to give her some character development.Steven Seagal was a bit meh, but then that's what he always is, so I wasn't expecting anything more.All in all, this is a fun little popcorn flick. It has a bit more gore than usual, but I didn't mind. If you're looking for a mindless action romp with flashy action scenes, this is better than most.",Machete

Trejo (From Dusk Till Dawn) plays the title character, a Mexican ex-Federale who seeks revenge after becoming framed and double-crossed. Seagal (Hard to Kill) plays Torrez, his former colleague who is a drug kingpin, De Niro (Heat) plays crooked senator, McLaughlin, Alba (Sin City) plays cop, Sartana who helps Machete, Fahey (Psycho III) plays McLaughlin's associate, Booth who hires and frames Machete, Rodriguez (Avatar) plays Luz, a tough vendor who is part of a network against immigration, Lohan (Mean Girls) plays Booth's daughter, April and Don Johnson (Miami Vice) plays Von, a shady, border patrolman. Cheech Marin and make-up artist/actor, Tom Savini (From Dusk Till Dawn) also appear. This is a pretty good action/revenge flick following in the footsteps of Rodriguez's earlier film, ""Desperado"" and is a Grindhouse film like ""Planet Terror"" & ""Death Proof."" It's got a good cast and plenty of violence. I recommend this.",Machete
65,jtindahouse,Truly unique,7,11 April 2018,"The first question you'll find yourself asking before watching 'Machete' is how they got such an A-list cast for a movie as bizarre sounding as this. You'll probably still be asking the question after the film is finished to be fair, but you'll also understand that the film is made with a lot more quality than what you might otherwise have imagined. The most incredible thing about this movie though is that with the incredible cast they got onboard, the main character is a man who barely speaks. This truly is a unique films in more ways than you can imagine.The best way to describe the film is just downright fun. I love that anything can and will happen at any point. You never know what's in store from scene to scene. No character is safe. The violence is extreme and plentiful. While they did well to get the star power of Jessica Alba signed on, this film is a reminder that she is in the industry for her looks and not her acting skills. She gives a very clunky performance, but damn she looked good doing it. Michelle Rodriguez falls into the same category.'Machete' is a film that is very hard to do justice for when simply telling people about it. It needs to be experienced to be understood. And I certainly would recommend seeing it if you haven't already because in this day and age where originality is seriously lacking a unique film of any sort is worth its weight in gold.",Machete
66,billcr12,Machete is action packed fun,8,2 May 2012,"Machete was first a fake movie trailer used in between Grindhouse, the double feature produced by Quentin Tarantino. His partner, Robert Rodriguez made it into a full length movie starring Danny Trejo as Machete Cortez, a former Mexican federal cop. His wife and daughter are killed when he tries to rescue a kidnapped girl. Three years later, he is working as a landscaper when he is set up as a fall guy in an attempt on a senator's life. The corrupt politician, Senator McLaughlin(Robert De Niro is hilarious) is on an anti immigration tirade. He holds rallies that look like 1930s Germany.Machete joins up with Luz(Michelle Rodriguez) who runs a underground railroad for the immigrants, and together they fight back against the fascist senator. Videos are broadcast on television destroying McLaughlin's career, he and a vigilante, Von Jackson(Don Johnson) try to kill the knife wielding crime fighter. This leads to an epic battle and ironic, funny scene which De Niro steals. Machete is a violent, fun action adventure done very tongue in cheek by Rodriguez, and I look forward to the sequel.",Machete
67,thinker1691,""" There is the Law and then there is what's right """,9,1 May 2011,"What began as a director's afterthought has emerged as a full blown action feature. The film is called "" Machete "" and stars as perhaps an unlikely hero as ever there could be. Danny Trejo is the character and hero 'Machete Cortez' an ex-Federal Mexican cop out to save a captive prisoner and is betrayed by the power behind the Mexican police. Three years later, our hero finds himself working as a day laborer when he is offered a lucrative offer. If he will assassinate a loud mouth U.S. Senator, named John McLaughlin (Robert De Niro) he will earn $150,000. Accepting the assignment, Machete poises for the kill when he discovers he has been set-up. It will be a noticeable shocker to American audiences, to see Steven Seagal playing Rogelio Torrez, the heavy in the story. In addition, there is Jeff Fahey, Cheech Marin and Don Johnson in unlikely character roles. Lindsay Lohan, Jessica and Michelle Rodriguez are excellent as the feminine Eye-candy of the story. The writer/Director is Robert Rodriguez and he gives free reign to the drama, action and all out explosive scenes which make this story a good candidate to become a classic for all the cast concern. Well worth seeing. Recommended. ****",Machete
68,freemantle_uk,Gratuitous Violence is Fun,8,25 June 2011,"When Grindhouse came out in 2007 Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez also commissioned some trailer for fake grindhouse movies. One of those trailers was for Machete, starring Danny Trejo and it proved so popular Robert Rodriguez made it into a film and started a new genre, Mexiplotion.Machete (Trejo) is an ex-Federale from Mexico who is betrayed by his superiors and a drug baron, Torrez (Steven Seagal). He fled to Texas, with the help of the Network, led by ""She"" (Michelle Rodriguez). ""She"" is being watched by Sartana Rivera (Jessica Alba), an Immigrations Officer investigating her and seen as a traitor to her Mexican heritage. Machete is recruited by a businessman, Michael Booth (Jeff Fahey) to assassin John McLaughlin (Robert De Niro), a Texas State Senator standing on a anti-Immigration, right wing platform. But Machete is betrayed again and he discovers a conspiracy involving Booth, McLaughlin and Torrez to control the drugs trade. Machete sets out to take them down and has ""She"" and Sartana against her.The best feature of Machete is the over-the-top action and violence. Robert Rodriguez know how to deliver a exploitation B-movie, it was stuff he grew up with. The action was actually well constructive and inventive, seeing Machete using a variety of weapons and enjoying hand-to-hand combat. There is even a funny use of stiletto shoes by Ms. Alba. There is also a good use of music throughout the film, especially when thugs attack a Catholic Church and there is a Spanish hymn in the background.The plot is simple but Robert Rodriguez made sure they was a lot of factions and characters. People who go to see Machete knows it is not going to be a art-house classic and just want to have a fun time. Machete is fast and fun, but I do Machete should have had more verbal comedy and been a little more tongue in cheek in tone as well as a homage. We have moved on cheap grindhouse films in midnight theatres. At least Tarantino can elevate this type of material.Acting wise you do not watch a Machete for Oscar winning performance. Whilst it is fun seeing people like Trejo and Seagal having a fight but both of them are unfit and really past their prime. Trejo is a decent enough hero, particularly as he is sliding and dicing villains. Other actors were on autopilot, particularly De Niro who just seem like he wasn't trying. A different actor would have been better suited for the role and De Niro's career truly has declined since the days of Raging Bull and Goodfellas. Michelle Rodriguez seem like she was having fun, but this was not the woman that impressed James Cameron. Overall the best performer was Jessica Alba, and that is statement you will not see often. She is decent throughout her and she actually treats her role seriously. But there are writing problem, turning Sartana from a competent officer to a dismal in distress and back again for when then situation calls for it.Overall, Machete is a fun film, but Mr. Rodriguez we film fans really want to see Sin City 2 and Sin City 3 sooner rather then later!",Machete
69,strong-122-478885,Machete Scrapes The Absolute Bottom Of The Barrel!,1,15 October 2012,"If nothing else, Steven Segal's hilarious-looking hairpiece absolutely killed me. In my opinion, it was the comedy highlight that this dreadfully dreary picture so desperately needed.You know, it sure seems to me that for director Roberto Rodriguez, women come in only one generic flavor. And that is the flavor of a ""boy-toy"" slut.Whether she's a highly-successful immigration office, or a street-level Taco-Momma/Secret Agent, or whatever, Rodriguez clearly brands all of his women (as he did so in Sin City and Planet Terror) as boy-toy sluts, through and through.And, of course, all of Rodriguez' boy-toy sluts are knock-out beauties. (Natch) But, regardless of that, just keep in mind that beauty may be only skin deep, but being a boy-toy slut goes right to the bone.Besides having a mighty low opinion of women, it would also seem that Rodriguez doesn't look too favorably upon the USA, either.Here in Machete, Rodriguez clearly points an accusing finger at America by turning this insignificant film into a heavy-handed political statement where he puts full blame on the US for clearly being the #1 reason why Mexico's present state of vicious crime, corruption and grave destitution is literally way out of control.And, last, but not least, casting that greasy, old fart, Danny Trejo (Rodriguez' cousin) as the title character was a stroke of pure stupidity. It really killed me the way this doddery, old fool was presented as being some sort of a bad-ass/stud-muffin where all of the hot babes were just dying to get him into bed. (Ha! Ha! Ha!)All-in-all, Machete, with its horrid racism, cruelty, and sadistic violence, was a poorly-executed production.In my opinion, Rodriguez' Machete was so infantile in nature that it could only satisfy the mind-set of a pre-pubescent, 10 year-old boy. In other words, from an adult's point of view, this film sucked, big time.Enough said.",Machete
70,dfranzen70,Bloody wonderful,8,12 September 2010,"To call Machete a bad-ass movie would be like saying Bambi is a sweet family film. Robert Rodriguez's remarkable, well-crafted revenge thriller gives you really everything you'd want to see in an ultraviolent genre movie, complete with guns, knives, profanity, nudity, explosions, and a girl in nothing but a nun's habit. It's the ultimate low-budget exploitation film done on a large budget.Danny Trejo, perhaps the baddest bad-ass in all of Hollywood - the man's done time for armed robbery, for goodness sake - plays the title character, an ex-Federale who watched his wife and daughter murdered before him by a corrupt cop. Now working as a day laborer in modern-day Texas, Machete is approached by a slick dude in a BMW, played by Jeff Fahey, who offers the - shall we say - interesting-looking Machete a boatload of money if he'll partake in a little assassination: the killing of a senator (Robert DeNiro) who's running for reelection on a platform of immigration, specifically illegals and the huge electrified fence he wants to erect to keep them out.This is obviously a very big issue in the U.S. right now, so the timing of the movie's release couldn't be more appropriate. But Rodriguez doesn't waste time trying to explain one side or the other of the story - such as with, say, Crossing Over - and instead puts the immigration issue in the background to the machismo and lone-wolf crusade of Machete.The film is peppered with familiar names. Jessica Alba plays an ICE agent (of course she does) who's worked her way up the ladder to Special Agent and who (of course) is of Latina descent. Steven Seagal is a drug lord, and it's his finest work. (Yes, I realize that's not saying much, but I think this was a role he was born to play.) Michelle Rodriguez is a legal Mexican who sells food from a cart and may or may not be part of an underground revolutionary network. Cheech Marin plays a priest, a brother to Machete; Lindsey Lohan plays Fahey's daughter. And like Rodriguez's other movies, each of these known quantities is there not for star power or recognition but because they fill a role. That's damn good casting. In fact, let's lay it out this way: Lohan, who will never be confused with Grace Kelly, is dead on as the nymphette, kinky daughter. She gets a lot of flak for her offscreen antics, but she nails this role perfectly. The fact that she gets naked helps a lot, too.From the very first scene, we know we're in for an atypical action movie. It's the scene in which Machete is betrayed and his family slaughtered before his very eyes. There's blood spattered on the walls, there is full-on nudity, and there's a classic villain setup.Machete the movie is certainly not meant to be taken seriously. We must suspend disbelief for pretty much the entire picture. Rodriguez's eye for detail and sense of unpredictability lend even more panache to a movie that already has Danny Trejo. Machete is stylish, gritty, vivid, and absolutely galvanizing. The end may never be in real doubt, but the sheer spectacle of Machete taking on bad guys and good guys and good guys who are really bad guys is a true wonder to behold. Robert Rodriguez is no mere action director; he's a true auteur of the genre. Violence exists in this movie not simply to show destruction, and nudity isn't there simply for the sake of debauchery. Everything serves a purpose, sometimes to lull us into a comfort level of acceptable - if implausible - movie deaths, sometimes to shock the living hell out of us. The director does not rely merely on the standard action-movie tropes, intertwining inventive effects with sincere plot turns. A lesser director might simply blow junk up and call it a day, using those effects to mask an imperfect script, but Rodriguez here uses that imperfect script - an homage to the exploitation pics of the 1970s - to buttress the effects, make them even more involving and spectacular.",Machete
71,PWNYCNY,Great movie.,10,7 September 2010,"This is one of the great movies. It's campy, it's goofy, it's noisy, it's incredible. Despite the violence the movie entertains. Robert DeNiro is great. It is his best performance in years. He shows a definite flair for comic acting. Michelle Rodriguez is stunning. She is beautiful. She is spectacular. Why she isn't in more movies is baffling. She is such a strong actress. Her presence improves any movie. Lindsay Lohan was HOT! And she is funny. Ms. Lohan definitely would be great as a lead in a television sitcom. But the best performance is by the lead actor, Danny Trejo. When Academy Award nomination time arrives, his name deserves to be on the list of nominees for Best Actor. This movie has the ""feel"" of a spaghetti western but is actually a well-crafted production. The movie offers nonstop action, snappy dialog, impressive special effects and catchy music.

Easily the most morbidly hilarious film I've ever seen, I was enduring fits of laughter at over-the-top triple decapitations within the first minute and shocked at the kind of material that was eliciting so many belly laughs. It's paper-thin by design, proudly heavy handed and clearly something everyone involved had the time of their lives filming, but the entertainment value does begin to wane by the end of the second act. It may have been more fulfilling as a joke trailer, though I'm sure I'll watch it again when I'm in the mood to shut off my brain and watch some carefree gore.",Machete
73,MBunge,Not as good as the trailer in Grindhouse,5,7 September 2010,"Machete contains a heaping dose of bloody violence, a moderate amount of nudity and waaaaaay too much sledgehammer moralizing on the issue of illegal immigration. It has some trashy thrills but becomes too bloated and blurred by Robert Rodriguez' inability to decide if he's making a modern version of the 70s exploitation flick, an homage to 70s exploitation flicks or a parody of the 70s exploitation flick.Machete (Danny Trejo) is a legendary and legendarily violent Mexican cop who tried to take down a drug lord named Torrez (Steven Seagal) and lost. His family slain, Machete is exiled to America and spends the next three years as an illegal immigrant day laborer. Then one day, he's hired by a man called Booth (Jeff Fahey) to assassinate a virulently anti-immigrant Texas State Senator (Robert De Niro). It turns out that Machete is just a patsy in a bigger and much more elaborate plot and, with the help of Immigration Agent Sartana (Jessica Alba), illegal immigrant underground leader Luz (Michelle Rodriguez) and his brother the priest (Cheech Marin), the squat and wattled Mexican juggernaut sets out to settle scores both old and new.This film has a lot of people getting brutally killed and several attractive women getting naked. Combine that with a bluntly effective performance by Danny Trejo and you've got the basic ingredients for some low brow fun. Unfortunately, Rodriguez does a very poor job in mixing them together. You can ignore that for a while, but it eventually leaves a bad taste in your mouth.To start with, there's just too much of everything in this movie. In addition to loads of cannon fodder, it has 4 major bad guys and three sub-level bad guys. In Star Wars terminology, that's 4 Darth Vaders and 3 Boba Fetts. Yet with all of those villains running around, Machete only manages to sort of kill one of them. In addition, one of those bad guys doesn't get just one ironic comeuppance, he gets 4 ironic comeuppances and they all happen in the last 15 minutes of the film. No, I'm not exaggerating for effect. And Machete doesn't just have one badass chick on his side, he's got 3. Too much of this movie is like an old school pro wrestling battle royal, with 20 guys in the ring at once all trying to throw each other over the top rope. It sounds neat in theory but in reality, it's just an undifferentiated mass of humanity flailing away at each other.It also doesn't help that this film has a very schizophrenic tone. At times, it's played fairly seriously as though Machete were supposed to be a straight forward action flick. Then there are moments that are much more tongue in cheek, winking at the audience to let them in on the joke. But then the movie sometimes goes so over-the-top that it can't be seen as anything more than parody. In Schwarzenegger terms, it's like combining Eraser with Kindergarten Cop and then blending that with The Last Action Hero.Lindsay Lohan is in Machete and she lookswell, just horrible. If you've ever wondered how accurate the tabloid stories are about Lohan's life, one look at her here will resolve all doubts. It's not only that she gives probably the worst performance in the whole cast. It's also that she appears far more haggard and world weary than the actress who plays her mother. The phrase ""rode hard and put away wet"" has never been more appropriate than to describe Lohan in this motion picture.There are some good bits to Machete but after an explosive start, it loses its zest in too many mood swings and gets weighed down by too many complications. This film began as a fake trailer in Rodriguez and Tarantino's Grindhouse and that's as far as it probably should have gotten. It's not horrible, but it's definitely not anything you need to pay theater prices to see.",Machete
74,MaxBorg89,Machete don't text. Machete rocks!,10,20 September 2010,"Wild, sexy, outrageous, entertaining, violent, trashy, spectacular. One could say that of Robert Rodrguez's Planet Terror, but even more so about the fake trailer that preceded it (in the truncated European version), Machete, a brilliant piece of phony filmmaking that almost outshone the actual film. No wonder, then, that fans went bananas when Rodriguez revealed he had written a script for a Machete feature as far back as 1993 and that the positive reaction to the trailer was a sign that he should make the movie. So here it is, at last, and it looks like the director (assisted by former editor Ethan Maniquis) has outdone himself: Machete might just be his best picture so far.Taking every single frame of the trailer and placing them in a narrative context, the film focuses on the eponymous killer (Danny Trejo), forced to live like a bum on the streets of Texas after a personal tragedy. Then one day he is hired by an unsuspecting benefactor (Lost's Jeff Fahey) to assassinate Senator Joihn McLaughlin (Robert De Niro), whose position on immigrants - especially illegal ones - is brutally enforced by the sadistic Lt. Stillman (Don Johnson). The whole thing turns out to be a set-up, since the failed shooting will boost McLaughlin's popularity and increase hatred towards the Mexicans. Then again, Machete is no bum, and with the help of a beautiful cop (Jessica Alba) and a feisty rebel leader (Michelle Rodriguez), not to mention his priest brother (Cheech Marin), he sends a very clear message to his enemies (which include Steven Seagal's drug kingpin): ""You just f*cked with the wrong Mexican.""Much like the trailer (which only featured Trejo, Marin and Fahey), or the entire Planet Terror for that matter, the feature length version of Machete sets subtlety aside in the name of pure, unadulterated fun: limbs are hacked off, cool one-liners are spouted (""Machete don't text""), human body parts are used in the most unusual manner and, of course, women are employed in many a sinful way. That said, Machete does have at least one bit of social relevance, with its not so simplistic look at the problems of immigration and the McLaughlin character who at times reminds of one Dick Cheney. Sure, the point is hammered home with a few pints of blood, but it's good to see that even a big-budget B-movie is capable of more profound thinking, however diluted it may be.On another level, Machete is also the epitome of Rodriguez's filmmaking, with all the ingredients neatly present, from family members in the cast and crew (most notably Trejo, his real-life cousin) to faces from the Mariachi trilogy (Marin), Spy Kids (Daryl Sabara) and Sin City (Alba), effectively mixing up all the different styles he's been using so far. He also outdoes his old pal Tarantino in the wacky casting department, since even QT would probably think twice before having De Niro and Steven Seagal in the same film. It's a decision that pays off, though, since everyone puts seriousness in a corner, meaning that Seagal actually impresses as the main villain, while De Niro and Lindsay Lohan (don't laugh) do their best work in a while thanks to some smart self-spoofing. Then there's the matter of Johnson hilariously receiving an ""Introducing"" credit in the title sequence despite his starring roles in Miami Vice and Nash Bridges, or Michelle Rodriguez becoming the RR version of Sarah Connor (eat your heart out, Rose McGowan). But most importantly, there's Trejo, who was born to play this part (remember ""Uncle Machete"" in Spy Kids?) and finally gets a chance to shine in a leading role, following a troubled youth - including a stint in St. Quentin - and a string of supporting parts, mostly as the tough guy. It's an opportunity he obviously relishes, as his Machete cuts through the screen and establishes himself as one of the decade's most shamelessly iconic heroes.First there was El Mariachi. Then came Grindhouse. And now the circle is complete: if you only watch one deliriously inventive B-movie this year, watch Machete. After all, you don't want to mess with the wrong Mexican, do you?",Machete

Trejo's Now a MOVIE LEGEND.,9,7 November 2018,"Finally the rugged tough guy bit part actor ""Danny Trejo"" got his own movie & it's excellent ultra violent action packed fun!!!Machete is a Trejo's greatest movie.Danny Trejo is a humble & decent guy & i just love to see his rugged face popping up in stuff & have checked out many flicks just because he's in it but usually it's a tiny role & he gets killed off but here we have Machete, his own movie & it's about damn time!!!! It was Robert Rodriguez From Dusk Till Dawn that introduced me to the Awesome Danny Trejo way back in the 90's & I've been a Trejo fan ever since.Trejo is one of my all time favourite actors, i love his voice & rugged old school look & real manliness that feels ancient compared to today dull & boring ""Pretty Boys"" of Hollywood with their lovely hair, blue eyes & perfectly ripped bodies lol Trejo is better!!!In our crazy violent times i believe we need a guy like Machete now,
""Machete"" is a fantastic character & Trejo is absolutely perfect in the gruff 'n' tough role, well it was written & created especially for him by the legendary ""Robert Rodriguez"" who i think is a fantastic unique Director.Trejo should have been an action hero long ago way back in the 90's but it just didn't happen & never would have if not for ""Rodriguez"".This main star lead role is way, way OVERDUE for Trejo but it's here & the movie is excellent & the character is excellent, i wish ""Machete"" would turn up in all sorts of films like The ""Expendables"" franchise for example as he's just such a cool vigilante character.Machete, i get is over the top & has silly funny moments but at it's rugged heart it's a violent & gritty 70's style Revenge action Thriller that would've played at a grungy old Grindhouse cinema & Trejo's face fits perfectly into that era of gritty & violent Cult Cinema & Machete is an instant Cult Classic.But if i had a complaint about this flick it would be that the main star Trejo as Machete does get put in the background alot & over shadowed by too much screen time of Robert De Niro & Jeff Fahey.So i can only fantasize about the sort of Awesome adventures & missions ""Machete"" could do like an ""Escape from New York"" type of movie or a from ""dusk till dawn"" type or ""Mad Max"" type or a ""Death Wish"" type, the possibilities are endless for such a cool character such as ""Machete"".""Trejo"" has been around for so long starring in everything but mainly B-movies & Robert Rodriguez films & he always stood out as the ""tough Mexican guy"" & i always liked him when he turned up in films like the ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" trilogy that's when i really noticed ""Trejo"" in the first Dusk Till Dawn (1996), when he played the scary tough bar tender turned vampire, he was AWESOME & scary, He popped up in another Rodriguez classic ""Desperado"" with his cool leather vest & throwing knives & was my fave in the movie & throughout the 90's he popped up everywhere from jungle adventure Horror like ""Anaconda"" (1997) to action Thriller like ""CON AIR"" (1997) & with van damme in ""Desert Heat"" (1999) & many more, all the way through the 2000's & still going strong now in 2018 the mans a legend!!!Rightly so ""Danny Trejo"" has become a Cult action hero in his own right with a following of fans so big just like fellow B-movie Cult hero ""Bruce Campbell"" i love these types of guys, the interesting but not usually main ""lead role"" character actors, i find those guys more interesting such as ""Robert Davi"" ""Ron Perlman"" ""William Sadler"" ""Robert Patrick"" ""Ernie Hudson"" & many more.Yep the tough rugged & tattooed Trejo is one of the greatest most recognizable ""character actors"" of all time & he's a real nice & humble guy in real life, he so deserved his long overdue iconic character Machete!!!MACHETE is a fun Action packed brutal but funny crime Thriller & Trejo is a great presence on screen & works perfectly as the lead in this vigilante fantasy from Robert Rodriguez, that's abit like a graphic novel come to life mixed with the old ""Charles Bronson"" 80's films of his Cannon days & the gritty & craziness of 70's exploitation cinema & it all works perfectly together, this has an actual story with a heart & some messages thrown in here & there but it's mainly what it's supposed to be & that's a fun Action packed ride through Mexico's crime world in grindhouse style.Yes Danny Trejo makes a great tough guy lead who was once a cop but turned vigilante after his family was murdered by an evil gangster boss played by the old bloated Steven segal!!! He actually plays being an evil goon well & you hate him lol that's not hard to do anyway!!!MACHETE is crammed with Rodriguez usuals & the film although starts very grimy & gritty 70's style it soon feels very much like a 90's action film as it goes on just like his Desperado movie & that's really cool for me as i first discovered Trejo during the 90's in lots of Action films so it's nice the movie feels like that.Machete Kills is also great fun too in a more Spoofy comical way.Another great Trejo movie is ""Bullet""(2014) another Trejo lead role & would make a nice double bill with Machete!!! In bullet He plays a tough old rugged cop in a revenge action Thriller that's excellent & again shows Trejo is a good solid actor & a good gritty lead infact Bullet would make a perfect double bill with Machete actually it makes a nice companion piece to Machete as both films are action Thrillers with Trejo as the lead playing a Tough cop (in Machete he's a ex-cop but hey) both the perfect Trejo fix & shows what a great action star Trejo is even if it is later in his life & career.Another special mention is the Awesome Action Horror Western DEAD IN TOMBSTONE, a great character for Danny Trejo, as good as his Machete.Trejo is a that rare diamond in the rough!!!that wise guy who has lived a tough life but keeps smiling & his first major role & movie couldn't be more fitting for him.ABSOLUTELY love Machete.Action packed old school ""Grindhouse"" violence but all done in a fun way.",Machete

Ridiculous violence, gratuitous nudity, sleazy villains, and Danny Trejo playing a protagonist for the ages. Not only was it goofy fun, it continued ratcheting up the awesomeness as it went. When Michelle Rodriguez stepped out of the ambulance for the climatic battle, I realized I was watching a movie good enough to own. Sometimes with great songs, you can tell the musicians were really having fun recording the performance. That's the kind of energy that comes through with this movie. If they're really making a sequel, that would seem to be confirmation that everyone had a good enough time to do it again. That's a sequel I'd be excited to see.",Machete

Unrepentant in the screenplay's lack of subtlety, and in the direction's forthright immodesty. Playfully unrestrained in its depiction of sexuality, and nudity. 'Machete' is a movie that does exactly what it wants, and asks no permission.No idea is too outrageous to include, from decapitation, violence with gardening tools, homemade softcore, far-ranging conspiracies, the very worst of white racist baloney (as a plot point), two-faced characters in every profession and from every faction, overblown one-liners, and much more. There's nothing it won't do. In that same spirit, 'Machete' boasts one of the most wild casts I've seen. Just scroll through the credits - the actors that were enlisted to bring this preposterous saga to life is beyond belief.This is an incredible and exhilarating ride quite like anything else I can immediately name. Some very serious themes and real-life issues are broached in the screenplay - plot points that serve as delicious fodder for the hungry furnace of over the top bombast.Through it all, veteran actor Danny Trejo, unmistakable in his appearance, anchors the film with ferocity, grit, and spite that's palpable even through our screens. There is no other performer I could possibly imagine filling this lead role.There's little more to say without betraying spoilers. One glance at the premise, or screenshots, let alone a trailer, will inform whether or not this is a movie a given viewer may enjoy, nevermind the penchant for flair Robert Rodriguez possesses as a film-maker. If 'Machete' sounds for one moment like it could match one's preferences, don't hesitate to seek it out. This is a brazen, extravagant, outlandish violent action flick that no fan of the genre can miss out on.",Machete
80,Jonny_Numb,Grindhouse Lightning Doesn't Strike Twice,6,5 September 2010,"I was in the ""indifferent"" camp when it came to the post-""Grindhouse"" fan push to see the succinct and wildly entertaining trailer for Robert Rodriguez's ""Machete"" turned into a feature film. In the back of my mind, there was a nagging doubt that a faux trailer couldn't possibly yield the same lightning-in-a-bottle results when stretched to feature length; and, for the most part, my doubts were confirmed. While it is nice to see Danny Trejo (as the titular badass) in a leading role that will likely re-launch his career, ""Machete"" adheres to the facets of '70s exploitation filmmaking with a reverence that, in part, works against the film as a whole: more often than not, those films played out their gory/horny highlights during the 3-minute trailer...and from there, you can see the conundrum. While ""Machete"" assembles a sterling cast of former A- and B-listers (Steven Seagal, Jessica Alba, Lindsay Lohan, Jeff Fahey, Cheech Marin, Don Johnson, and even Robert De Niro), threads through a nice (if completely overstated) commentary on illegal-immigration paranoia, and stops periodically for an ""oh-no-they-didn't"" moment (a thug's intestinal tract being used as a rope, for instance), the overall experience lacks the grungy verve and balls-to-the-wall craziness that made ""Planet Terror"" such a nostalgic love letter to a bygone era.5.5 out of 10",Machete
81,ShootingShark,Machete Don't Text !,6,22 October 2013,"Machete Cortez is a former Mexican police Federale hired by a shady Texan lobbyist to assassinate a senator with a tough stance on immigration. Meanwhile, Sartana Rivera is a cop investigating both the illegal aliens and a right-wing vigilante group attacking them. When Cortez and Sartana are thrown together by circumstances, fireworks start to fly.I like Robert Rodriguez films a lot and this one is typical - it's great fun, full of wonderful performances, manages to make both subtle political points and be ridiculously over the top, and is super-stylish from start to finish. No self-respecting cult movie fan should miss his work. There is a problem for me though, and it's the pace of the plotting in his movies; it's not that the stories are confusing or rushed, it's simply that as soon as I start to enjoy a sequence or a character's development the pacing is so fleeting it hurtles onto something else before any atmosphere or suspense is generated. My plot summary above is okay, but it doesn't even mention the Seagal character, who is the chief villain and Machete's nemesis, and in order to do so I would need to explain five other story points. The entire plot and dialogue of Once Upon A Time In The West would probably fit in the first three scenes of this film, yet the Leone movie is far richer, far deeper, far more interesting, but just as deliciously strange and enjoyable. For me, the best character and performance in Machete is Fahey as the slimy aide-de-camp Booth, purely because he is given the most time to develop between shocking/funny plot twists. Having said that, it's Trejo's film all the way, and it's wonderful to see him finally get to be the leading man after twenty-five years of heavies, villains and sidekicks. Alba, Rodriguez and Johnson are all terrific too, and the ensemble is full of the director's talented stock troupe, notably Marin, Sabara (the boy from the Spy Kids movies), and makeup effects genius Savini. The style is wonderful, with influences from Hong Kong cinema, westerns and eighties action flicks (a short scene where Machete picks out his weapons with Fahey is almost a shot-for-shot parallel to one in Escape From New York) but also filters in its own Latino sensibilities, culminating in a terrific showdown between the Network and the vigilantes. Machete's character has complex origins; he appears (as Uncle Machete) in all three Spy Kids movies - though is arguably not the same guy - then in one of the five fake trailers in the Rodriguez/Tarantino double-feature Grindhouse; a sequel to this film, Machete Kills, has just been released. Featuring great music by Rodriguez' band Chingón, this instant cult classic is bloody, very well made, a little exasperating and a whole lotta fun.",Machete

Danny Trejo gives a great lead performance and Michelle Rodriguez, Jessica Alba and Jeff Fahey all give great supporting performances. Robert De Niro, Steven Segal and Don Johnson all give gleefully over the top performances. Robert Rodriguez's and Ethan Maniquis' direction is fantastic, it's well filmed and reasonably well paced.

83,Samiam3,More bloody fun from Robert Rodriguez,7,3 September 2010,"An ex cop with a mindset for revenge, his chosen weapon; anything sharp. A rogue fed whose scream is higher than her kick. A taco stand operator who knows how to shoot. A drug lord as big as a tank, with a katana. A priest who loves fire power more than god, and a racist senator with a very silly re election campaign.Based on a fake trailer from Grindhouse, Robert Rodriguez has started out the new decade with Machete. The whole Rodriguez gang is here, plus some new recruits. Robert de Niro is here, Linsay Lohan is here, and for the first time in a decade Steven Seagal is on the big screen. He is now so over weight that when we see him, he takes up most of the frame. Danny Trejo after playing fourth or fifth wheel in all the Rodriguez films has finally gotten himself a lead role. Though he's not all that funny, I'm not gonna complain. Machete is a team effort, and everyone does their bit.Robert Rodriguez has a very distinctive sense of humour. What he is best at is visual gags. Here is a man who looks at pair of high heels and sees a weapon, a man who envisions how somebodies intestines could be used as an escape route from the upper levels of a building. His humour is able to sustain Machete for about two thirds, but not the whole thing. the movie has a bit of climax trouble. Rodriguez gives it his best shot, but is unable to find a balance between humour and violent action. What we get is chaotic, and features one too many story contrivances. Watching Trejo and Seagal face off with swords is more disappointing than it should have been, because there is too much talk. But still, Machete works. It does its job, and the ending makes it fairly clear that more is on the way. Sounds good to me.",Machete
84,SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain,Machete (2010),9,26 December 2011,"At last, Danny Trejo gets his leading role. After years of playing ""that Mexican guy"" he finally has a character to take to franchise level. It's great to see such unapologetically violent action films making a return. Here Rodriguez guides his hand over an exploitation film that knows exactly what it is and how to handle its themes. The messages about immigration are VERY heavy-handed, as they should be. The cheese and fun are all here. The action scenes were mostly inventive and exciting. To see Trejo pull a Die Hard using intestines was a real delight. Trejo has a real commanding presence, but also an unmistakable likability. Machete isn't just a killer. He's a broken man with a heart and one that will take mercy on the villains. This makes him accessible and not just some mental kill machine. I loved the music and the cinematography which combined to give the film a constant warmth amongst its violence. It's a gruesome ride, but one that doesn't take itself too seriously.",Machete

The kind of cheesy thing about this movie is that it looks as though it aspires to be some kind of a Quentin Tarantino movie with all those quirks and crazy images. Yet it falls so lacking, both in being an action movie, or being a Tarantino copy. Danny Trejo's all time expressionless face doesn't help the character in focus at all. Nor does his being so slow on those scenes just right before the stunts. You can see the gaping difference in movement on where it's Trejo, and where it's the stuntman. The presence of many big names such as Jessica Alba, Michelle Rodriguez, Robert De Niro, and Steven Segal, helps just quite a bit in making this movie enjoyable.",Machete
86,Sandcooler,The salt and pepper of filmmaking,9,21 April 2014,"""Machete"" originally started out as a throwaway gag trailer from Quentin Tarantino's ""Grindhouse"" project, but director Robert Rodriguez figured: I've gone through the trouble of making the trailer, might as well actually make the movie. Not too surprisingly, the actual feature looks a lot like a really long preview. Machete is up against a bunch of guys, he kills them all, then new guys, new location and same outcome. The thing that keeps you watching throughout this fairly repetitive 100 minutes is just how over the top all this stuff can get. And oh God, this one delivers so fantastically. Robert Rodriguez' forte has always been inventive kills, and he really brings his A-game to this one. Another thing I really enjoyed is how this clearly apes 70s exploitation movies in style and substance (if any) and so gives us plenty of entertaining B-listers to point at and say ""hey, it's that guy"". From the leads to the tiniest bit parts, there isn't a single boring actor in this movie. Even Steven Seagal with a questionnable Spanish accent manages to hold his own, while Don ""Miami Vice"" Johnson supposedly rose from the grave (seriously, how did they even think of him?) to totally steal the show from all the working actors. ""Machete"" probably isn't a good movie, but it's so entertaining you won't give a damn.",Machete
87,Matt_Layden,Not as fun as Grindhouse,7,5 September 2010,"Grindhouse was the most fun I had in the theatre in a long time and that experience I believe won't be matched. It had the right amount of everything and the entire audience was enthralled by it. It failed at the box office, which made it even more of a true Grindhouse film. Now we have Machete, a full length feature film based on one of the trailers that was attached to Grindhouse. Out of all the trailers, this one had the most potential to be an actual film, and here we are. Machete was a lot more fun in trailer form, then it is in feature form. I had fun here, but the film is a lot less Grindhouse and a lot more political. It starts off with a great bang and has the audience set up for a bloody good time. It's violence was unrelenting. Then it starts to suffer from it's story line, it's lack of tongue in cheekiness and the length. The film still has great moments, but they are only scattered throughout a disjointed piece. Machete was perfect for the trailer, and only mediocre for it's film. The film surprisingly has a strong cast. Danny Trejo is the title character and the story of the trailer is the exact story here. He is hired to do a job and is double crossed. He was hired by Lapidus, I'm sorry, Jeff Fahey, to assassinate Robert DeNiro. We later find out that it was all an attempt to get more sympathy votes for him when he survives the assassination and the police start looking for Machete. There are subplots about immigration that really take over the story and are in your face with it's content. Jessica Alba is the Immigration Officer, she still is a bad actress, even in a piece like this. Michelle Rodriguez is apart of a resistance called The Network, who go after DeNiro, the Senator. Other parts of the cast are played by horror make-up legend Tom Savini, Robert Rodriguez long time pal Cheech Marin, Don Johnson, Lindsay Lohan who seems to be playing herself and Steven Freakin Seagal. With a cast like this you would expect it to be really campy and B style, but it takes itself way to seriously at moments and it loses it's sights on things. Seagal could have been great in this piece, but instead he sits around and talks the whole time until a fight at the end, which clearly shows his age and the fact that he has let himself go. The standouts are Don Johnson and Jeff Fahey, they play their evil roles perfectly and fit right into this film. DeNiro is a bit off here, he isn't his usual self and he seems out of place at times. I didn't know if he was trying to hard or was phoning it in. The film is violent and bloody. People loose limbs, heads and what not. It's clearly over the top and it plays on that very well. The rest of the time you're waiting for it to get to the good parts. Danny Trejo is great, but he is no leading man. He should stick to character pieces, although I am glad he finally got his spotlight. He is one scary and ugly looking guy, who always seems to get the ladies *cue porn music*.Machete is something that could have been great fun, but it leaves most of the fun in 2007 with Grindhouse. A heavy political theme drowns it out too much and it actually tries to give the viewers a message instead of simply being a low grade trashy film. I had more fun with Piranha 3D than Machete, which is a surprise.",Machete
88,lewiskendell,Fantastic trailer leads to a good (but not quite as fantastic) movie.,7,7 January 2011,"""We didn't cross the border, the border crossed us!""To say that my expectations for Machete were sky-high would be something of an understatement. Robert Rodriguez can do some great work (Sin City is one of my favorite movies), and I loved how Grindhouse turned out. With a cast this amazing and that awesome initial trailer to use as a template, I was completely prepared to welcome a new movie into my top 25. Machete didn't quite live up to my lofty hopes, it's still a fun movie that I'm glad to own.I think the main misconception I had about Machete was how over-the-top it would be. Sure it has a lot of ridiculous action, t&a everywhere you look, and some campy dialogue, but it doesn't come close to approaching the glorious absurdity of Planet Terror. I think Rodriguez restrained himself somewhat, in order to focus more on the message about immigration that he's trying to convey. I can understand his decision to do this, as it's obviously an important issue to him. Still, I can't help but wonder how Machete would have turned out if he would have focused purely on grindhouse-style entertainment, and left the numerous serious moments (and occasionally, a bit preachy) for another day.But really, despite my mild disappointment, my opinion of Machete really turns on two points. The first is that it gave Jessica Alba the rare opportunity to star in something that didn't suck (I'm an unapologetic fan of hers, mediocre acting and all), and the second is that when Machete lets itself go and concerns itself only with being a fun, bloody, absurd action movie, it's a really good time. The promise of the original trailer might not have been completely fulfilled, but I'm so happy that we even got this movie at all, that I'm not going to complain much.",Machete
89,brando647,Danny Trejo as....Danny Trejo in.....,7,31 January 2011,"The Quentin Tarantino/Robert Rodriguez double-feature collaboration GRINDHOUSE was (in my opinion) the best film of 2007 and ranks as one of my top favorites ever. I thought the faux trailers placed in the film to authenticate the movie's grindhouse flavor were awesome, and I would love to see films made of them all. The trailer for MACHETE was fun but not my first choice for a full feature adaptation. Still, I need to give credit to Robert Rodriguez for listening to his fans and putting out a full movie based on their overwhelming demand for more. Machete (Danny Trejo) is a former Mexican Federal, left for dead after witnessing Mexican drug lord Torrez (Steven Seagal) murder his wife. Living quietly in Texas as an illegal day laborer, Machete is hired by a corrupt political adviser (Jeff Fahey) to assassinate a senator with a strong anti-immigration stance. Double-crossed, Machete is now hunted by those who wish to keep him silent while he begins a violent quest to eliminate the men who set him up.I suppose it was only a matter of time before Rodriguez gave a starring role to his long-time friend Danny Trejo. Trejo has had long run as various ""angry Mexican"" supporting characters and, now that he's got his own movie, he's given the chance to do something more. Instead, he's doing the same thing, but with more screen time. I suppose the man knows what he's good at, and that's playing the strong, silent thug. In any other movie, this might evoke a collective groan from those forced to watch it but this is a grindhouse movie. His brutal violence and corny one-liners (""Machete don't text."") are perfect for a movie where the action and the sexuality are the real stars of the show. The story itself, your standard revenge flick, is pretty basic and yet still manages to become convoluted with everyone double-crossing everyone else and some subplots needlessly thrown in. For example, Lindsay Lohan's character of April Booth wasn't at all necessary in the film. Her character exists only to connect the poolside sex scene from the faux trailer to the film, but we're given some extra time to see the scum life she leads and her mysterious arrival at the final confrontation. How'd her character even know where to go? We don't question it; we just revel in the raging violence on screen.As I'd stated, the violence and sexuality are about the only reason to watch this film. It's an exploitation film (sorry...Mexploitation film) and it does a pretty good job at accomplishing what it set out to do. The film begins to lag in the mid-section as the action slows down and we're treated to a bunch of exposition, but the first and final half hours of the film are great fun. Despite being throwaway fun, Rodriguez has managed to assemble some interesting talent here (and, of course, they're mostly bad guys). Robert De Niro really seemed to be enjoying himself as the corrupt senator, and I had fun watching him play an ignorant redneck bent on eliminating the ""immigrant plague"". Don Johnson (yes, Miami VICE and NASH BRIDGES...that Don Johnson) was my favorite part of the film as the cold-blooded head of a vigilante dedicated to patrolling the US/Mexican border. Michelle Rodriguez is equal parts solid and sexy as the head of an underground network of illegal immigrants, and Cheech is given his customary Rodriguez cameo as Machete's brother. Cheech had some of the best moments in the film and I wish he'd been given a larger role.Unfortunately, the film has some glaring weaknesses that prevent it from being great. I suppose this isn't a surprise at this point, but Jessica Alba was miscast as the I.C.E. agent on Machete's case. I'd given up on Alba a while ago and she wouldn't have been such a downer if she wasn't so prominent in the film. Some of the blood CGI effects don't hold up well. I don't know why Rodriguez feels the need to use computer-animated blood when practical effects look so much better (and have got to be cheaper). And, again, the film slows to a crawl during the second act as it begins to focus on the exposition and we're spoon-fed a story that was annoyingly complex to begin with. This is a grindhouse film, after all. MACHETE did decent enough in box office receipts that hopefully Rodriguez will some day make good on the two sequels promised at the film's conclusion. Then Danny Trejo can return to the role that made him famous...himself.",Machete

Expect every excess of popular film making and you will probable find it, or alluded to, here.. As this was my first foray into this genre, I watched the whole thing (and there are sequels!). For its genre it is a cult classic.

Danny Trejo is funny and has screen presence as the sword-wielding and gun shooting man trying to settle a score. The comedic ultraviolence is funny but the intensity of it, for amusement, inevitably wanes. Use of irony is also a perishable commodity. It resorts to stylizing, overworking the self-referencing and comedic incidental music. Most of the scenes without Trejo are less watchable, because the story is dull and the dialogue is uninspiring.

So it was not new for me though I liked how the director kept us engaged through out the movie which is hard in formula story like that. Danny Trejo is the most Ugly Actor I've ever seen in life and also the most Ugly person I've ever seen kissing beautiful girls like Jessica Alba, Lindsay Lohan and Michelle Rodriguez. (Yuck) though he acted well and carry Off Machete extremely well. Among all the leading ladies, it was Michelle Rodriguez who stole the show and comes off #1. She was incredible, she has never looked that HOT ever on screen. Her body, moves and action was top class. Jessica Alba comes at #2, she was dirty and her moves were sexy too. Lindsay Lohan comes at #3, apparently during all her screen time she was undressed and her Lip surgery (trying to look Exotic like Megan Fox) can be visibly noticed. Its sad that a Superstar like her fall so deep into the gutter. I truly hope one day she strike back but for now she should avoid doing roles like that.

93,Screen_Blitz,"Extremely violent, bloody, but stylish entertaining Grindhouse flick",7,13 August 2016,"Following his success with the double-feature 'Grindhouse' with collaboration with his longtime friend Quentin Tarantino, Robert Rodriguez makes a fabulous return to the action genre with this Grindhouse-style actioner. Packing abundance of graphic, over-the-top violence and gore, and retro-style cinematography; this action piece pays homages to classic B-movies from the 70s and 80s but with a more polished execution than what we experienced in 'Planet Terror', the zombie horror half of Grindhouse. Taking the lead is charismatic action star Danny Trejo as the titular character Machete who is back again at taking on the bad guys, following his previous appearance in the fake trailer in Planet Terror, along with his more prolific appearance as the uncle of the lead characters in the more kid-friendly 'Spy Kids' franchise. This film follows the title character as masterfully skilled federal who is disgracefully betrayed by Michael Booth (played by Jeff Fahey), the man who hired him to assassinate Texas Senator John McLaughlin (played by Robert De Niro) who plans on ridding the state of Mexicans from crossing the border. Following his attempt on the assassination, Machete is gunned down by a sniper who happens to be an accomplice Booth and his boss Torrez (played by Steven Seagal). With the assistance of his Catholic brother Padre (played by Cheech Marin) and sexy immigration officer Sartana (played by Jessica Alba), Machete sets out for revenge.With Danny Trejo in the lead role and Robert Rodriguez in the director's chair, there is only so much you can expect from this off-the-walls action flick. In that case, those who go in awaiting sense of realism and grit are probably going to be disappointed as Robert Rodriguez embraces an over-the-top approach reminiscent to old exploitation movies from 70s and 80s. This means exaggerated violence and Tarantino-style blood splatter, one scene in particular involves Machete tearing out a man's intestines and using theme to swing through a window. But in the midst of the carnage however, is a surprisingly clever political undertone which deals illegal immigration of Mexican natives through the U.S/Mexico border and Robert De Niro as the racist Senator trying to eliminate the so-called dilemma, citing Mexicans as terrorists and drug lords. This is where Michelle Rodriguez, playing a taco stand operator, comes in place as her character runs a network smuggling Mexicans through the border. While the political themes fit suitably for the plot, the way in which they are executed doesn't always work. But that's not the real deal here. The performances by the cast aren't too bad, nothing too great either. Danny Trejo in particular shines fresh as the action hero here, especially during the action sequences; Steven Seagal on the other hand is just your average one-dimensional villain with nothing really interesting in the character department. Robert De Niro, for the highly acclaimed actor he is, isn't given anything much interesting to work with here aside from the anti-Mexican politician he portrays. In the end, there is still plenty of fun and excitement to endure, mostly notably in the action scenes including the climax at the end which prove that though Robert Rodriguez may not have the best taste in writing, he allows viewers to experience tension with over exaggerated action set pieces. Even better, he also makes fair use of the vintage-style cinematography rather than executing it in a way that distracts viewers from the atmosphere like what we experienced in Planet Terror.Machete is a stylish action thriller that is startlingly entertaining and charismatic, despite the over-the-top nature it pervades. Of course, the anti-Mexican themes and absurd amount of graphic violence do happen to stray this film from making it a solid choice of everyone, action fans or not. In the end, Robert Rodriguez puts this action piece to good use in the midst of it's notable flaws.",Machete
94,Troy_Campbell,Nowhere near as good as it should've been.,6,21 November 2010,"Machete was embedded into cinematic history before it was even unleashed onto blood-hungry audiences. Those of you who saw Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino's devoted b-grade cinema homage Grindhouse, made up of two movies - RR's Planet Terror and QT's Death Proof - and five fake trailers, will already know of Machete's inception. Despite the Grindhouse experience flopping Stateside and causing the two flicks to be released separately from then on, the mock trailer of Machete gained instant cult status. Such was the overwhelmingly committed following, it was decided to expand the world of the ex-Federale into a feature length picture, for better and for worse.Immediately apparent - thanks to the opening scene of Machete chopping down dozens of henchmen with his, erm, machete - is that the focus of the film will be primarily on delivering tongue-in-cheek violence and comically shocking moments. A completely naked woman producing a hidden mobile phone from a bodily pocket is not to be taken seriously and is most definitely not for everyone, but those ludicrous scenes are exactly what lends Machete it's mind-numbing entertainment. Rodriguez has now mastered the art of ridiculous, yet cool, action sequences and he lets rip here. In one particularly memorable scene Machete, like a Mexican MacGyver, utilises a foe's intestines like I've never seen before. Unfortunately everything in between the blood and guts is not up to scratch like I expected. It's trailer roots are glaringly obvious by the middle act when the plot becomes unnecessarily nonsensical and is clearly not of any great importance to Rodriguez. Like in most movies paying tribute to bad films of the past, the acting is hit-and-miss. Trejo nails the laconic charisma of Machete and Alba and Rodriguez are decent enough as a tough Customs Officer and underground freedom fighter respectively, but there's also a showing of some horrible performances namely from the laughable Seagal, the downright vapid Lohan and, most disappointingly, the past-it De Niro.The over-the-top gore and intentionally corny dialogue is enough to keep this Mexploitation flick enjoyable, but it's nowhere near as good as it should've been due to the sporadic cast and lack-lustre screenplay.3 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Fine, 3 - Good, 4 - Great, 5 - Brilliant)",Machete
95,oneguyrambling,2010's 'must see' at your local drive in.,7,8 April 2011,"More than anything else it is important to understand that Machete is a film made by Robert Rodriguez.It is now 15 years since he first gained notoriety through Desperado, a film about a lone Mexican fighting against injustice and gunning for revenge against those who wronged him. He has been making the same film ever since, and I like all of them.Since Rodriguez has found his niche and is perfectly intent in it we know certain givens going in...There will be too many characters. On both sides, good and bad. The script will struggle at times as it tries to find time to highlight them all.There will be a great number of ""name"" actors (De Niro, Alba, Michelle Rodriguez), some Robert Rodriguez specials that seem to appear in all his films (Machete himself - Danny Trejo, Cheech Marin, Tom Savini), and some non-actors (His nieces, his doctor, his real estate agent, Lindsay Lohan).The ""hero"" will be quiet, brooding, menacing but 112% deadly. And facing insurmountable odds.^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^And all of the above is true in this case, as it was in El Mariachi, Desperado, Once Upon a Time in Mexico, even Planet Terror.(I'm not sure about Spy Kids, haven't tracked that down yet.)In this case Machete loses his wife and child and is left for dead before the opening credits even roll.He is then hired - though forced is a more accurate descriptor - to kill a US Senator who is vehemently against illegal Mexican immigrants and has built his whole campaign around keeping them out by whatever means necessary. Only Machete is set up and gunned down, once again left for dead.Like a horror movie slasher though it takes more than a few bullets and a little fatal stabbing to keep a good man down, and the rest of the film has Machete and various good guys gunning down and being gunned down by various bad guys.Recover. Refresh. Revenge.The violence is graphic and plentiful, ditto the nudity... but too many people will focus on the fact that Lindsay Lohan finally appeared in a profitable film - for about 6 minutes.It would have been a great drive in movie, but it's 2010. Now Machete will gain notoriety because it has a few stars that appear prominently in tabloids, and because most film reviewers will be facing this type of film for the first time, not having previously slummed it in video stores.Machete is quite enjoyable, entertainingly and gobsmackingly violent, especially early and eminently forgettable. Nonetheless the film did leave me knowing more about how things work in Rodriguez-World...In Rodriguez-World* Necks are made of butter.* Hot naked chicks can still carry stuff.* Even after decapitating a victim it is a good idea to still have a parting hack at the headless torso.* The human intestine is incredibly strong and apparently easy to grab and hold on to.* You can eat a burrito and fight at the same time.* A 42 kilogram woman can not only be a cop, but work and live alone without ever being menaced.* Minions are plentiful and faceless.* You can kill someone with practically anything (there are more different killing weapons in machete than any other film I have ever seen).* Steven Seagal is 50 kilos heavier than he was in the 90s - and still can't act.Final Rating - 7.5 / 10. Don't construe any of the above as being negative (aside from the too many characters vying for plot attention), even though Rodriguez makes the same movie over and again - it's a damn fun movie.",Machete
96,Pumpkin_Man,An Awesome Bloody Good Time!!!,8,8 September 2010,"This is the movie my friends and I have waited three long years to see. It's very bloody, gory, sexy, kinky and funny and that's what makes it a good movie to see with your buds. I noticed there were a few scenes from the faux trailer that weren't used in the movie, but it won't ruin the fun. Danny Trejo stars as Machete, a former Mexican Federale turned renegade. Three years after a drug-lord named Torrez killed his family, Machete is in Texas trying to find work. Machete is soon hired by a businessman named Booth to kill the corrupt Senator McLaughlin. After Machete is set-up, double crossed, and left for dead, he puts together a team of illegal immigrants to kill the bad guys. If you wanna eff with the wrong Mexican, I highly recommend MACHETE!!!",Machete
97,antoniotierno,a somehow cartoon like movie describing an interesting political context,7,16 May 2011,"A nonstop action-movie featuring many (maybe even too many) interesting characters, such as a vigilante/killer, a drug lord, an opportunist politician (Robert De Niro), and many others. The thing is that the overcooked plot tries to tell about a political underworld/illegal 'wetbacks'lived by right-wing politicians and businessmen exploiting the racist backlash they incite. There's a huge quantity of violence (see Rodriguez's blood-spattered cartoon violence), there's also a little of politics as well as some gratuitous nudities. But overall the best part of the movie is in my opinion the sight of heavily tattooed character actor Trejo, here in his first leading role – at the young age of 66 - after many supporting and secondary (even tertiary..) ones. He favours machetes (as per the title) but Trejo's is probably the part of the story working the best.",Machete
98,areatw,Ridiculous but bloody good fun!,7,9 September 2018,"'Machete' plays more like a spoof of an action thriller than anything else and is clearly not intended to be taken seriously. It's ridiculous from beginning to end and really should be categorized as a comedy. It's so silly and out there that there's just no way this movie wasn't created with the intention of making people laugh. The action and violence is so overdone it's comical and the plot is nothing short of farcical.I think it's fair to describe 'Machete' as trash, but it's also incredibly entertaining and great fun to watch. People who like their movies on the light hearted side will love this movie because it doesn't even take itself seriously. You can tell Danny Trejo had great fun playing the title character and De Niro and Alba are also highly entertaining in their roles. 'Machete' is a ridiculous movie, clearly intended to be a joke, but for a good couple of hours of entertainment, it's well worth watching!",Machete
99,TheUnknown837-1,I'm pretty happy to be out of that theater right now.,3,5 September 2010,"The year 2010 has showcased both ends of the exploitation action flick genre; we received this year first-class examples of opposite sides of the scale. On the good end of the scale, we have Sylvester Stallone's exhilarating and delightfully humorous ""The Expendables,"" a film which has placed at #5 on my favorite films of the year thus far. On the opposite end, the bad side, we have a terrible, unbelievably cockeyed movie named ""Machete"" which is not only a very bad movie, but perhaps the worst movie that I've seen in a theater this year.This is B-movie exploitation gone wrong. Very wrong. ""Machete"" starts out on a lame note, and gets worse as it goes along. As my father, who was seated beside me for the grueling 105-minute running time, so eloquently put after we left, ""It starts out stupid...and gets stupider as it goes along."" I couldn't have said it better myself.""Machete"" is a confused mess of a film that would like to be an exciting satire on the U.S.-Mexico border issue. Danny Trejo, a very good tough guy actor, plays the titular role of an ex-federale who turns into a vigilante in order to take down a corrupt senator (played by Robert De Niro, of all people) and his squinty-eyed aide (Jeff Fahey). He encounters many allies and enemies, including a sexy government agent played by Jessica Alba, Michelle Rodriguez as a revolution leader, a killer-turned-padre played by Cheech Marin, and a drug lord played by the most wooden and colorless big name in Hollywood: Steven Seagal.Right from the very beginning, we know that ""Machete"" is a film to be filled end-to-end with blood, guts and brutal, glorified killings. In the opening five minutes, we see people beheaded, stabbed, shot to death, you name it. What follows immediately afterward gets even more brutal, more disgusting, and more tiresome. There would be nothing wrong with extreme violence if it were done with a purpose. In the latest ""Rambo"" movie, Sylvester Stallone let loose with a lot of gruesome killings and torture scenes, but he did it with a purpose, to show the horrible things that took place in real-life everyday in that part of the world and to make despicable brutes out of the movie's villains. These killings are glorified and meant to be grin-inducing. But what's even more depressing is that the movie doesn't even know what to do with its tone. Sometimes it thinks its violence needs to be horrifying, and other times takes the assumption that we can laugh at moments such as a man's intestines being used as a rope ladder. Give me a break. I had already lost hope for the film at this moment, but when I saw this, I just spread my arms and sighed. ""The Last Airbender"" had been dethroned; the true worst movie of the year had rolled around.And there are many, many moments just like these in ""Machete."" And when we don't see Danny Trejo beheading people with a gigantic, glimmering blade, he has incredibly stupid interludes with other characters, which are truncated and brief and thrown aside in favor of spraying more fake blood on the wall. The movie makes a feeble attempt to satirically comment on the immigration controversy, but throws it away in order to continue its sickening, brainless tirade.There are countless things about ""Machete"" that shocked me. But what was most appalling was the enormous amount of talent that was wasted on this clanging failure of a film. The movie was partially directed by Robert Rodriguez, who has made some stylish and entertaining movies before and it has a great cast. I like Danny Trejo and Jessica Alba. Michelle Rodriguez, a fun and beautiful actress, is also in good form despite the nothing role she is given here. Robert De Niro, one of our best actors, is completely wasted and I still wonder why he chose this screenplay over the many he must be sent every day. The best performance is by Jeff Fahey, an underrated cinema performer, as the sneering, conniving senator's aide. His moments are fun to watch and he somehow manages to take awful dialogue and make it work. Too bad he wasn't in more of the film. There are also some bad performances, especially by Steven Seagal, whose denouement scene is unbelievably corny, and Lindsay Lohan, whose character has no purpose whatsoever in being in this movie.There are times when this movie becomes so bad and so harebrained that it makes you laugh, but most of the time it is so stupid that even people with the lowest of standards can't help but become bored.""Machete"" is a brainless and aggravating exercise in tedium. No matter how high the budget may be, the movie is of the lowest quality because of the way it drains the sincerity out of filmmaking. When I left the theater after seeing it, I was in stone-silence for a long stretch of time before going on a several-minute rant with my father on how awful the experience of watching it had been. We were overjoyed to be out of the theater and that we never had to go through it again. The torture was finally over. There are many really good movies playing right now. The ones I recommend above all others are ""Inception"" and ""The American."" There are also some bad movies and ""Machete"" is by far the worst of the lot.",Machete
100,reddiemurf81,Machete don't text,6,26 November 2020,"If you're looking for action, on top of more action, along with a lot of fake blood shots, this one is for you! Lol!! It's an awesome movie from a great director. I'd say a 6.5 all the way.Machete (Trejo), a former federale, finds himself set-up as a patsy when he takes on a hit job.Michelle Rodriguez, Jessica Alba, and a cast of familiar faces round out the film.So go watch it!",Machete
101,fmarkland32,Cuts like a knife...,7,4 September 2010,"Machete (Danny Trejo) is an ex-Federale turned day laborer who has a tragic past involving a drug lord Torrez (Steven Seagal, in an unexpectedly lively performance) while in the country illegally he is given 150,000 dollars to assassinate Senator McLaughlin (DeNiro) who's stance on immigration is unpopular and hence needs to be made a martyr or so his campaign manager Booth (Fahey) thinks, the job goes awry and all of it leads to a fight between Mexican revolutionaries led by Machete going up against demented minute men led by Don Johnson (in a great performance) in a movie that delivers what is expected and occasionally flirts with greatness. Danny Trejo is an excellent actor and he makes for a charismatic hero in the vein of Charles Bronson, meanwhile the villains are first rate, Steven Seagal, Don Johnson and Jeff Fahey are all fantastic playing against type. Indeed it's ironic that De Niro is the most lightweight of the villains here. Michelle Rodriguez, Lindsay Lohan and Cheech Marin also lend strong support to a movie that works well as parody. Indeed Jessica Alba is the only one who comes off as lame. Indeed she ruins what chance this movie has for 4 stars by being far less charismatic than Rodriguez and Lohan. The movie also has faults in the way that Johnson doesn't get nearly enough time on screen and Rodriguez' return is unexplained as well, but for what it is, Machete works and although the comic level isn't as inspired as in Planet Terror, Machete is certainly worth a look. Indeed my only other complaint was that they didn't try to make the film look vintage 70s like in the original Grindhouse trailer.* * * out of 4-(Good)",Machete
102,one9eighty,Machete probably don't read reviews,7,19 February 2021,"In 2007 Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino made the ""Grindhouse"" double-feature, which brought audiences ""Planet Terror"" and ""Death Proof"". Hidden within ""Grindhouse"" was a fake trailer for ""Machete"", which starred Danny Trejo as a bad-ass Mexican Federal, turned vigilante. This was not the first time that Trejo had appeared as a character called Machete in a Rodriguez feature, he also played Machete in the Spy Kids franchise too (2001 - 2011). Although I have not seen the Spy Kids films, I can imagine that while the character has the same name, the themes within the different Rodriguez features are completely different, one being a family friendly comedy action series, the other being a trashy exploitative B-Movie.Machete Cortez (Trejo) has had a rough time of late, while working on a case his partner is killed, then the target he was after is killed (but not before stabbed him in the leg), he is betrayed by his corrupt Chief who gives him to a powerful drug lord called Torrez (Steven Seagal). Torrez kills Machete's wife, promises to kill his daughter, and then leaves Machete for dead. Fast-forward 3 years and his life is not much better, he is making a living as best as he can doing odd-jobs and gardening. For a moment though, his luck might be able to change. He is approached by a businessman, Michael Booth (Jeff Fahey), with a proposition - well, more a threat. He is tasked with killing Texas State Senator John McLaughlin (Robert De Niro) who has secretly being deporting hundreds of illegal immigrants. Of course, if Machete refuses the job, Booth will just have him killed there and then. Remember when I said his luck was only about to momentarily change? Well, that is because it is all a big set up - McLaughlin will not be killed, Machete will be framed, the media will get behind the story of a Mexican taking a shot at the senator, and ultimately McLaughlin will be lorded over.Machete is a wanted man - the law wants him; Torrez, Booth and McLaughlin want him, as does a whole host of bad guys. Soon enough too, Machete is hunted by a persistent US Immigration and Customers Enforcement Agent, Sartana Rivera (Jessica Alba). He is also hunted by hitman Osiris Amanpour (Tom Savini) who is hired by Booth. Thankfully though, Machete is not out of ideas yet, through Luz (Michelle Rodriguez) he might still be able to find a mysterious rebel leader called ""Shé"" for help. Machete can also call on Padre, his ""holy"" brother (Cheech Marin) for support. With nothing left to do but fight for his life and his freedom - bad guys beware - Machete is focussed on retribution and revenge.Although a joint venture in directing between Rodriguez and Ethan Maniquis, the Machete character can be credited to Rodriguez alone. In 1995 while making the ""Desperado"" film Rodriguez was impressed with Trejo and knew then that sometime in the future he would make a film which had Trejo as the lead role.""When I met Danny, I said, 'This guy should be like the Mexican Jean-Claude Van Damme or Charles Bronson, putting out a movie every year and his name should be Machete.""Trejo does not disappoint. His character is an adrenaline fuelled, hard-as-nails, mean and nasty, S.O.B. that also manages to fluidly transform into a Lothario when it is required too. Trejo was 64 years old when he played this part, but he still played it like a younger, more spritely man. Sure, his weathered appearance has made him look old throughout his career, but to me he still looks the same as when he first came to my attention in film through the 1990's.The supporting cast around Trejo are great too. Having featured in the ""Grindhouse"" trailer it was nice to see Cheech Marin and Jeff Fahey return for the feature length version. Michelle Rodriguez and Jessica Alba's characters in the film are far from eye-candy, both are strong women that play their own part in the film, which are delivered with good performances. The bad guys in the film, played by the likes of Seagal, De Niro, Savini, Fahey, and Don Johnson, all feel a bit comic in their delivery, but executed well all the same. In fact, it's not just them that feel comic, a lot of the time as the film ventures on and different things happen, or random characters appear - it sometimes feels like this is actually an animated cartoon that's been brought to life. The film does not take itself too seriously and there are times when the performances by the actors is gritty and authentic; but equally, there are times when a knowing look at the camera is intended to directly talk the audience about how ludicrous this who thing is too. The balance is maintained well.As you might expect if you have seen the other ""Grindhouse"" films, this is intended to be a tongue-in-cheek, schlock, B-Movie, semi-exploitative film which pays homage to the ""sex and violence"" films that came out between 1960 and 1980. It ticks all those boxes and is a fun film with a lot of over the top and bonkers action, a simple enough story which is still engaging, and has some lovely technical work behind the camera to make this look and feel in fitting with its ""Grindhouse"" tag. I found it impossible to sit through this with a straight face - I was either open mouth with amazement at what I have seen, or I was struggling to breath as I laughed uncontrollably. This is more a comedy than a horror film, it is more Mexpolitation than exploitation, its... err... well, not for everybody, but for the audience that it is for, it will be loved.Yes, this is a cheese fest - but it is meant to be. Leave your brain at the door and just watch a random bat-sh!t crazy action film that harps back to some of the cheesy films of the late 1900's in design and delivery. If the unkillable Machete is angry, you better hope it wasn't you who angered him, or you might find he uses your intestines to write an angry letter :D",Machete
103,SanteeFats,Disappointed,5,29 June 2013,"I watched this movie because of Jessica Alba and the fact that Danny Trejo actually got a good guy role instead of his usual bad guy and dying at the end role. The more I watched this movie the more it pretty much just turned in to a revenge motivated slasher type movie. Jessica Alba in any movie is a plus in my book. Why she agreed to do this one is beyond me. Maybe she likes Danny, maybe she liked the bad ass role, maybe she just needed the money. I don't know. Over all this movie is okay but it leaves a lot to be desired. The action is so so and the ending is predictable as heck. Of course the bad guys lose and the good guys win",Machete
104,phubbs,Machete,5,29 July 2014,"The film famously spawned from one of the fake parody trailers that was seen in the Tarantino and Rodriguez movie 'Grindhouse'. Personally I'm still up for the movie of 'Werewolf Women of the SS' which looked much better, you never know, they've done a movie for all the others I believe. As I'm sure you're all aware this film has been deliberately shot in that old grungy 70's B-movie exploitation style which continues from its trailer parody roots.The films visuals are purposely scratchy faded marked and at times slightly glitchy to match those of the heyday of grindhouse/exploitation crapola. Now myself I don't really like this era of film and the way it looked, the films beginning credits sequence being a brightly coloured badly composed montage of film stills accompanied by some seriously retro text font and cheesy action music. The whole thing reminded me of my childhood days and those hammy American cop shows like 'Chips' or 'Starsky and Hutch' (take your pick from many). Of course this film is much much more hokey than those shows and is influenced by films before my time but I still shudder at the thought of it, I do remember some darn hokey stuff I can tell you (1977 Spider-Man movie).So being a crummy sleazy grindhouse action flick you can guess the plot isn't gonna tax your brain. Well you would think that but its actually quite relatable to current affairs both in the UK, Europe and the US. I refer to the various immigration issues flying about these days which has grown stronger over the last few years, especially right now in the US where there are US citizens actively protesting in Texas against immigrants coming in from Central America. Obviously I'm not suggesting that any of the corruption, wall building and assassination attempts seen in the film are happening but the the films basic plot is eerily familiar.As for the film its exactly what you'd expect and more of what we saw in the parody trailer. Danny Trejo has a big machete and various guns, his mission is to get revenge on the corrupt suit that set him up on an assassination attempt against a corrupt Senator who is tough on immigration. The reason being they want it to look like an illegal Mexican tried to kill the Senator for his tough stance on immigration, thusly giving their cause a boost with the public and the excuse to build a big wall across the Texan border.Along the way Machete meets up with a few characters that help him. Cheech Marin is a Padre with a mean trigger finger, Michelle Rodriguez (who is cast in the same role every time) plays the tough Latino bitch who also has a mean trigger finger, Alba is a US Customs and Immigration officer with a mean trigger finger and Lindsay Lohan pops up too...with a mean trigger finger. On the baddie side is Savini as a hit-man with a mean trigger finger, Don Johnson as a sadistic redneck vigilante border patrol leader and of course Seagal as the big boss who is a dab hand with a katana.Honesty the plot is highly convoluted (I've confused myself writing this!) and only serves to stuff as many big names in as possible, its like a Mexican/Latino Expendables. I can't really moan about that though as you know right from the outset the film is purposely ludicrous and outrageous. The same can obviously be said for all the action and violence, I found that it gets more absurd as the film gets towards the finale. At first it felt quite gritty and semi realistic to a degree, you know its a parody but you can run with it. But towards the end everything gets way out of hand with awful looking CGI action, explosions and blood everywhere, terrible death acting by the extras, crazy situations, Michelle Rodriguez getting shot in the eye and surviving and the hokiest death scene ever by Seagal. Honesty it actually looked like a something from a blooper reel! funny but..really?There are some clever moments of parody admittedly. I liked the baddie henchmen who discuss their jobs and what they think of their boss, the fact that one of them is starting to think that the boss is actually a bad guy and whether they are in the right line of work. Plus the fact they actually have injuries from the last fight they had with Machete, they chat about them, then in the end two of them quit before getting killed, finally realising its not worth it.Its very hard to review really as I know its all deliberate, its been made to look bad and cheesy, hokey acting and silly 'A-Team-esque' scenarios. On one hand I can kinda deal with that but on the other...its just sh*t! and it gets worse as the film progresses. Its a shame as the film is fun and more of an adult action flick for the most part with blood guts and tits on display. Unfortunately your suspension of disbelief is crushed towards the end, it goes beyond a mockery and morphs into a childish James Bond type of picture. I did quite like the final end credits and voice that announces Machete will return in 'Machete Kills' and 'Machete Kills Again'...nicely retro, nicely done.5.5/10",Machete
105,tim-764-291856,"Enjoyment - 9, Story - 3",8,11 June 2012,"This enjoyably over-the-top action romp from cult ace director Robert Rodriguez storms its way rather like a really great lad's night out.What's there not to enjoy? Robert De Niro playing the sort of character he plays best and should try and play far more of, instead of those weak comedies he seems to get talked into doing plus an often nude Lindsey Lohan. Steven Seagal puts on a silly accent and looks a bit a ridiculous; puffed-up, overweight.Gun-toting bloody violence, including 'nun' Lohan slo-mo spraying bullets interjects a rather ridiculous plot that is best ignored. You don't need to think during this movie - why spoil it with having a story to get in the way? The sunburned ochre colours of the Mexican border is the focus of this bandit/road movie/sleaze'n'greed extravaganza.Grizzled Mexican ex-cop Danny Trejo IS Machete, as is his deadly choice of weapon. And, you won't quite believe where a lovely naked lady removes her mobile phone from, to notify that Machete has arrived...De Niro is a dodgy senator who now mercenary Machete is paid to eliminate.Jessica Alba is top-billed but she's rather weak, or at least her character is, at least in comparison to some of the other, more interesting ones, here. However, my money is on the deliciously lithe, brunette, moody Michelle Rodriguez, who, towards the end, adorns little more than rubber bikini and the biggest mother-of-a-gun you've ever seen. She's also one of the few here who actually acts, too. As Luz, she organises employment across the border for the locals, with a road-side cafe as a front. Alba is a CIA agent who spies on Luz. She's not related to the director, if that's what you're thinking.Yes, this is testosterone-injected brainless mayhem and isn't the most PC movie ever made, probably one of the least subtle in its violence but just ploughs on at the speed of a bullet-train so entertainingly, that it's a must for when us adult males need to relax and switch off.Good film? Not if you're a film critic, but as a punter, bloody ace....",Machete
106,cultfilmfan,Machete,9,5 September 2010,"Machete was originally one of the fake trailers between the films Planet Terror and Death Proof in the put together homage to 70's exploitation films Grindhouse from Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino that came out in 2007. I thought Grindhouse and both films plus the fake trailers were a lot of fun, but unfortunately filmgoers just did not go to see it, so it did very poorly at the box office. There was news for awhile that the Machete fake trailer in the film was going to be made into a real movie and then also at one point I heard it might be a direct to video film, which worried me because, so rarely are any of those really good. Robert Rodriguez lucked out though and Machete became a major studio release. Wanting to satisfy my love of the 70's grind house and cult films I was looking forward to Machete. For those who read my review of last week's Piranha could tell I was disappointed with that effort. It had a lot of things going right for it, but it just wasn't pulled off to my complete satisfaction. Machete on the other hand met my expectations and then some. To really get into the plot of Machete would just spoil the film, but it is mostly an outrageously over the top, cartoonishly violent and way out there film in the same vein as the two films in the Grindhouse film from 2007. There were several things I really enjoyed about this film. Without giving too much away the film does deal with Mexican American characters and takes place in America where an electrified fence is trying to be build on a congressman's re-election campaign and we have a Sheriff Joe Arpaio type vigilante sheriff in this film enforcing the border and using any means of violence to make sure the Mexicans do not come over into the states. I thought this was perfect timing for a movie like this because over the past few months in Arizona, there has been a lot of debate and hostility towards a new immigration bill and cops (like Sheriff Joe Arpaio) enforcing the law on anyone they think may be an illegal immigrant. Watching interviews and stories about this debate on television, one thing that really struck me about it, was that the people opposed to legal immigration and such seemed to come off as racist, or having racist tendencies and a lot of these laws, or the ones they want to go into effect seemed to be based on hatred and racial profiling. So to see all this lampooned in this movie with these over the top characters, pleased me because I found all of it to be ridiculous when I watched it on television originally. There is a message to Machete underneath all the dismembered body parts and it is relevant and very becoming of the times especially now and I admired it for that. Also all the over the top acting in Machete was actually pretty good. The characters over emphasized their lines and purposely made it look like they were not good actors, but they actually did do a good job and made the film more entertaining because of it. The story offers no real character development, but I did not feel that it needed it because there was so much action and things going on that if they were to include that I think it would weigh the film down and become too long and besides the audience who went to see it would most likely not be that interested in that anyways. The style and mood of the 70's exploitation films was here and I thought the filmmakers did a good job trying to bring that back. Not to mention that Machere is a very entertaining film. If a lot of over the top violence and a ludicrous script is not your type of movie, do not see Machete, but for others I think you will have a great time with it. People going into this movie will have certain expectations for it and I think they will be met because mine were. Forget the other attempt to capture the 70's exploitation in Piranha and go see Machete it is better in pretty much every single way and a lot more fun too. I had a blast with this film and I hope more movies of this kind are made because they are great summer, or end of summer entertainment.",Machete

109,bellino-angelo2014,Don't try to analyze this movie too much... just turn off your brain and enjoy.,6,25 February 2021,"I have seen this movie twice during last year. The first time at March during the total lockdown and the second time last August one evening after I returned home running with my best friend. And my opinion has always been the same.This is basically a revenge story: in the beginning we see Machete (Danny Trejo in one of his best memorable roles) and he has his home invaded by some thugs sent by Torrez (Steven Seagal) and they kill his family. Years later Machete is caught up in a political scandal with a senator (Robert de Niro) that has some sort of connection with Torrez and there is also from time to time Von Jackson (Don Johnson) as the head of the border patrol that kills every Mexican in sight. And then you have Jessica Alba as one of the officers investigating on the De Niro scandal and Michelle Rodriguez as the leader of the Mexican resistance and even Lidnsay Lohan as a religious girl. Crazy as it sounds, isn't it? Well, it IS! And they are all having a blast!!If you think that this is an action movie, well... you are wrong as it plays more like a satire of a genre with some incredibly absurd action scenes that make also laugh a lot. It's pure mayhem going on and it's all crazy scene after crazy scene. Some of the scenes were quite gross tho, and if it wasn't for them I would have given a higher score than 6.Danny Trejo gives one of his best leading man performances in his huge career and it looks like he was having the time of his life (even with women). Steven Seagal is actually good as the villain and also Robert de Niro and Don Johnson give funny supporting performances. While Jessica Alba and Michelle Rodriguez are a bit misused they have at least the purpose of being gorgeous.While this isn't certainly a movie for intellectuals, it's actually very funny as it never takes itself seriously and despite I didn't loved it, it was quite a fun experience. Not a must see but a movie also to watch with friends for having a laugh.",Machete
110,K3nzit,Really bad,1,2 January 2020,Sometimes a B-move can be so bad that it becomes funny - 'Machete' is definitely not one of those movies. Brain-dead action genre did definitely hit a new low in 2010 with 'Machete' and 'The Expendables'.,Machete
111,johnstonjames,"A Little Dubious, But Ultimately Cool And Satisfying Entertainment.",8,25 March 2011,"""if you're not Mexican you'd better become Mexican fast"". that's what the mythical/real character 'She' tells the flip flopping senator played by DeNiro. well if you're not Mexican, and you really like and dig this flick and Rodriguez and the fab Danny Trejo, you'll probably turn Mexican real fast. everything about this movie is fast. i don't have any problem with turning Mexican. it's not like the white dominated system in America ever really works for a lot of us that don't fit in. besides, almost ALL of my neighbors are Hispanics (most probably from Mexico), so i don't have any probs with being Mexican. with the exception of having no gang affiliations, attending church regularly, and having children, i feel like a Mexican a lot of the time. why not? Mexicans are cool. despite it's numerous problems, Mexico is a beautiful and great country.too bad so many people feel they have to leave the country they love to escape the problems of home, only to come here and face a whole new set of problems and get blamed for every problem that was already here before they came. you can take every illegal immigrant out of this country and America would STILL have a whole lot of problems and no insight into them.i thought it was pretty trippy that this film took the unpopular and controversial issue of supporting illegals from Mexico and was sympathetic with the problem. i love a good controversy. kudos to Robert Rodgriguez on that issue.politics aside, this was a really fun and entertaining action flick with a intriguing and powerful political statement. sure a lot of it was silly, but it was meant to be ""tongue and cheek"", something that will probably be lost on rigid viewers that somehow think most action flicks are realistic even though they hardly ever are.and Danny Trejo is totally awesome in this. he is such a outrageously good action hero and it's great to see him in a starring role. the rest of the acting in this was top notch. especially for something that is obviously adrenalin junkie fuel like this stuff.Robert Rodgriguez is a fantastically fun director and this low-budget exercise in ""dubious"" taste proves it. this was pure adrenalin high, pure fun and pure hilarious comedy. i mean what can you say about having Lindsay Lohan dressed in a Nun's habit? almost borders on blasphemy. i suppose it's no worse than having that filthy little stoner Cheechey Marin as a gun-toting Catholic priest. but again. is THAT any worse than having the Cheechey do voices for cuddly, cutesy Disney cartoons? remember 'Ollie & Co.'?this was a ""way cool"" action flick. almost as good as 'Grindhouse'. i wanna see it again.",Machete
112,vostf,Dumb and furious,4,3 April 2012,"OK, I'm not a sucker for cheap over-the-top violence meant to be great fun, so my opinion won't matter to most of the Rodriguez and Tarantino fanboy herd.I like the way they enjoy making movies though. They love movies and they love making movies, that's what makes stuff like Machete watchable to me. The energy and simplicity of the process... lots of high-brow directors, stuck on dishing out Academy Awards contenders, could learn a lot from them.Now, be it Tarantino or Rodriguez I simply can't take an evisceration or the magnificent graphic killing of some guy as a good joke. Call me wimpy if you like, I feel in my gut this is not right. Yes, killing zombies or aliens by the dozens with a chainsaw can be fun. Big difference. Too bad all the cheap unrelenting violence simply dozes the political background: here you can tell the director is not confident with subtlety, but it's frank and direct albeit lost in the blood and fire works.Tarantino is the man who made Pulp Fiction and he never upped the ante, just doubled down on kick-ass violence. Rodriguez seems content with that kind of movies and I don't think he will ever come closer to something like the Good the Bad and the Ugly. Let's hope he will try harder.",Machete
113,DarthVoorhees,"My kind of cheese, a gory, gruesome and exploitive action ride",7,4 September 2010,"'Machete' will have its haters. It will have people believing it is a political film, it'll have people believing it wants to start a race war. What the film is though is cheesy entertainment. It is stylized action and fun done right. I love the genre of the big B movie that Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriquez have perfected. 'Machete' hearkens back to the brilliant grind house days and offers exactly what is promised fun.I loved 'Grindhouse'. The Weinsteins butchered the film by splitting 'Death Proof' and 'Planet Terror' in half. The film was an experiment about the B Movie experience. By themselves 'Planet Terror' and 'Death Proof' are merely okay films but with the fake trailers and the grainy film complete with missing reels, it is an awesome experience. I remember seeing the 'Machete' trailer for the first time and the reaction it got was incredible. That initial trailer was simplicity it's self, 'Machete' the ultimate bad ass killing and sexing machine on revenge against Jeff Fahey. That was all, the trailer hit all the right notes.Fast forward to the big screen 'Machete' and I was kind of disappointed by how crowded this film was. There are far too many characters and surprisingly 'Machete' takes second fiddle to Jessica Alba! Cheech Marin's brilliant Padre role is reduced to nothing but a glorified cameo. Fahey who is brilliant in the film isn't even the main villain! It seems as if 'Machete' is placed in a world impossibly larger than himself. It's kind of a let down after waiting three years for this film. Now don't get me wrong everyone has a lot of fun with their performances. Both Alba and Michelle Rodriquez have a lot of screen presence. Don Johnson, Robert Deniro and Jeff Fahey all make excellent villains and give very strong performances.What kind of lessens the film is Rodriquez' choice to make Steven Seagal the main villain. Seagal has a name, that's it. He still can't act worth a damn. The film needed a villain to anchor it and Rodriquez picked the least intriguing of the bunch. Why try to make Seagal the main villain when you have Robert DeNiro in the cast?! It seems like sacrilege. I personally wanted Fahey to be given the most screen time but his character receives an almost redemption in his death scene. What makes the film worse is that Machete doesn't even kill any of the villains. The trailer and even the premise leads you to believe that the climax of the film will be Machete not just killing but massacring his foes. De Niro, Fahey, Johnson, and Seagal(kind of) don't fall to Machete's blade.These are minor complaints really because the film works. It hits all the right targets and is insanely fun and funny. It reminds me very much of a B movie in the seventies realm and there are moments when the classic Grindhouse film grain return. The film has Mexiploitation elements but it really isn't a political film. It has a great sense of humor and makes fun of the political themes in a gory and over the top finale which is hilarious and satisfying. Seeing the taco cart being rushed into battle is hilarious. Did I want to see more of Trejo? Yes, but I got my money's worth from 'Machete'. It was a fun film.",Machete
114,Christian_Dimartino,See it. Now.,8,18 September 2010,"Director Robert Rodriguez returns with his latest film, Machete, an audaciously over the top action film which includes many over the top funny things and bloody things and gore galore. If you have the stomach for it, then find it now.Danny Trejo plays an ex cop named Machete, who's family was once murdered. And when a politician's assistant(Don Johnson) hires Machete to assassinate his politician boss(played by Robert Deniro),who is anti immigration, he is framed,and is forced to go on the run. And seeks vengeance. Along the way, he meets a customs agent(played by Jessica Alba) who teams up with him.Machete is ridiculous. It's bloody,and actually kind of sexy. The casting choices are weird. We have Cheech Maron as a priest, Lindsay Lohan gets in a 3 way with Danny Trejo and her character's mother,and Robert DeNiro plays a redneck.The movie goes on a little longer than it should. Or it feels that way. But I had a blast. I laughed a lot. I was blown away by stupidity. I left logic at the door. I enjoyed Rodriguez's other works. That is probably the only way you can watch it. If you enjoyed From Dusk til dawn, Grindhouse, or Sin city(a masterpiece), then you will go for Machete. Others may not. I did though. See it.4/5",Machete
115,DonFishies,An awesome experience brought down by way too many inconsistencies,6,19 September 2010,"It was rumoured for quite some time after Grindhouse that Robert Rodriguez would make the hilariously awesome fake trailer for Machete into a full length film. For as incredible an opening as it made for the epic double feature, I never truly thought Rodriguez was serious. After all, much like his much more successful brethren Quentin Tarantino, he is a man who likes to talk about projects that never actually pass the development stage. But sure enough, all the talk about Machete actually turned out to be true. But was it really a wise decision to stretch the trailer into a full length feature? After watching his wife get murdered in front of him, ex-Federale Machete (Danny Trejo) is banished out of Mexico and stuck in Texas on an illegal green card. He spends his days doing manual labour for cheap alongside other fellow exploited workers. He gets hired to kill Senator McLaughlin (Robert DeNiro), who has a plan or two about keeping the illegal Mexican workers out of the States – but ends up getting double crossed, and left for dead. With half of Texas after him, not to mention Mexican drug lord Torrez (Steven Seagal, yes you read that correctly), Machete seeks out his revenge.The plot description may not sound like much, but that is only because it covers the mere basics. Much like Once Upon a Time in Mexico, Rodriguez has stuffed far too many supporting characters and even more subplots into the mix, and the film drowns as a result of it. It never seems to be able to stay on one plot thread for longer than a few minutes before it jumps onto another. It lacks a cohesive ideal, and even at its best of moments, it feels like a jumbled mess of overflowing thoughts. Some of these plot lines easily could have been saved for a sequel, a tie-in comic book series or even cut out entirely. Throwing them into the film just feels like overkill, and makes the film a lot sloppier than it should be. It was marketed as being a Mexploitation flick, so why make it overly complicated and worn down? What makes things worse is the fact that some of these plot lines are so needless that they make a ridiculously energetic film feel incredibly boring in more than a few instances. The running time is just over 100 minutes, but it feels well over two hours. The entire scheme revolving around illegal Mexicans and how they should or should not be kept out of the United States is a good thread to latch onto, but not for an otherwise goofy genre picture like this. The movie was never meant to be serious, and to me, was always intended as a one-off, fun picture to make. Instead, Rodriguez lets it get boiled too far down into a movie with some form of political commentary, but it never sticks or actually feels right being in the film. The trailer never suggests a political slant to the film, so it is clearly a new device of Rodriguez's that he should have left out of the film entirely.Another weird element of the film is that every single shot from the original trailer from Grindhouse is in the film, whether it fits the scene or not. Some of them look okay, and have been edited in rather seamlessly alongside new footage. But other shots just have a bizarre, otherworldly look to them that blatantly make them look like they were part of something else at another point. I thought it was clever at first to include the shots, but got increasingly annoyed with how different they looked compared to the rest of the film. Their gritty, scarred up style fits the Grindhouse look of the film – but that look is not maintained throughout the entire running time of Machete. Had it been maintained or stayed consistent, I think I would have liked that stylistic choice a whole lot more. As it is, it just does not fit and seems to react more as Rodriguez and company not having a consistent vision of what the film should look like.For all the complaints, Machete still has a lot of good things going for it. For one, it is both ridiculously hilarious and incredibly brutal; often in the same sequence. When the film is not trying to be overly serious with its political intentions, it is taking joy in allowing Machete to dispatch his victims in the most gruesome of ways possible. Never did I think I would ever see a man use another man's intestines as a rope to jump from one ledge to another. It is these scenes that live up to the promise of the trailer, and makes this ridiculous idea into the film it was always meant to be. But again, there is a real lack of consistency overall, and it really does hurt the film at every turn.Acting wise, there are no particular standouts, as everyone seems to be hamming it up or overacting to the point of verging on parody. Trejo, the most consistent supporting character actor working currently, is awesome as Machete, but the title character never seems to be treated like it. The ensemble aspect seems to get the best of him at most points, and he never really gets to shine as an actual actor, as opposed to a glorified bad ass. Special props go to both Jeff Fahey and Don Johnson, who shine as they gleefully overact their way through the film.In parts, Machete is an awesome experience for anyone who always wished the fake trailer would become a real movie. As a final cohesive product, the film has way too many characters and ideas. It is this lack of consistency, that easily could have been fixed, that is the real disappointment.6.5/10.(This review also appeared on http://www.geekspeakmagazine.com).",Machete
116,gigan-92,Robert Rodríguez Takes a Stab at Politics,5,23 May 2012,"First off, I'm very familiar with the exploitation genre, myself being a huge fan of this director's work (""From Dusk Till Dawn"", hell yeah!!) and I've watched ""Hobo With a Shotgun"" at least a hundred times. And I always thought Danny Trejo deserved his own movie because he has that action-movie persona. To this movie's credit, it has some entertaining action scenes. After all, who didn't love Trejo using a man's entrails to swing from one window to another? Plus I loved the majority of the characters and the actors chosen to play them. I adore Tom Savini, Cheech Marin was pretty cool, Robert DeNiro received ample screen time, why not, and even Lindsay Lohan played her part well. I loved Don Johnson as the bad guy. Then come my complaints Why was Stegal in this movie? I was never a fan of him to begin with, but here he should've acknowledged he was past his prime. Out of shape and off-screen for the majority of the movie, his sword fight at the end was very disappointing to say the least. Stegal's era ended in the 90s and for good reason. Jessica Alba as a Mexican, hot but why? Her dialogue was so written so (purposely?) bad I'm not sure what the point was. Not to mention the whole plot of Machete's dead wife isn't even mentioned but once or twice, becoming gloss in too many damn sub-plots. Any who, I wouldn't really recommend it, hope there isn't a sequel.",Machete
117,dave13-1,Basically a 1987 action movie...,7,18 April 2012,"...if only the other action movies from back then had been this entertaining. Most of those action movies had evil drug lords and avenging rogue cops trading punches and bullets, and this one follows the archetype, but manages a more coherent crime conspiracy plot, more action and a ton of laughs. With sly satiric shots at US-Mexico border relations, and unexpected casting twists - 80s action heroes Don Johnson and Steven Seagal play bad guys here - this movie manages to be a lot more clever and fun than most of its antecedents. The tone of the movie is serious, but there are so many action movie clichés brought out and kicked around that the result is almost self-parody. The violence is so over the top as to be actually silly, and leading actor Danny Trejo is so ugly that having beautiful women throw themselves at him like he's Shaft becomes a running gag. But the production values and splatter effects are solid - making this a better LOOKING movie than most of its predecessors - and the performances and script are also uniformly solid. Even viewed simply as a straight action movie Machete is solid entertainment. And for those of us who watched WAY too many bad action movies back in the late 80s, it's something special.",Machete

Of these, ""Machete"" was the one that I honestly could have seen being made into a movie. And wonderfully it was.This is not a movie to take seriously. This is not a movie to analyze. This is not a movie to discuss later on about it's merits and the symbolism behind Machete's machete. This is a movie to sit back, enjoy and laugh your ass off. The director is making a B movie on purpose with A-list actors all hamming it up and and putting Danny Trejo front and center as the titular Machete. He's the meanest, baddest and most dangerous man on either side of the Mexican border. Add to it a star studded cast with the likes of Robert DeNiro as a sleazy politician, Steven Seagal as a drug lord, Jeff Fahey as one of Steven's enforcers, Don Johnson as a border patrol vigilante, Cheech Marin as a priest who's not above kicking ass for the Lord, Jessica Alba as the sympathetic ICE agent and Lindsay Lohan as a nun with the gun.

120,richieandsam,A fun film to watch. I liked it!,7,2 September 2014,"MACHETEThis film started out as a fake trailer for the middle of the Tarrantino / Rodriguez film Gindhouse. It was a great touch and I was glad that the film was made in the end.The story is about a guy named Machete who is framed for the attempted murder of a senator who is trying to stop illegal immigrants.This film is super violent. As soon as the film starts you can tell what kind of movie this is going to be. Within the first 5 minutes there are be headings and loss of limbs. There is blood everywhere. It is completely unrealistic but fantastic at the same time. It was made as if it was a 70s slasher film. You have everything in it to make you think this is a really old film, yet it was made in 2010.I love the vision Rodriguez has for his films. He has clear influences that he uses and he does it so well.There are some hilarious moments in this film too. It was made like that on purpose. The tongue in cheek moments were brilliant. This has everything you would expect from a film like this. Blood, guts, nudity, bad language and terrible acting... but the bad acting was done on purpose because that is how it was back in the 70s.Because the acting was bad it means the actors actually did a brilliant job. The movie stars Danny Trejo﻿ as Machete. I love Danny. It is about time he got a leading role for himself. He has been in so many good movies and deserves the recognition. Other great cast members were Robert DeNiro, Jessica Alba, Steven Seagal, Michelle Rodriguez, Jeff Fahey, Cheech Marin, Don Johnson and Lindsay Lohan﻿. I can't fault anyone at all... the perfect cast for this kind of film.The effects were over the top... on purpose. They looked great.

123,socrates99,Amazing how a little Alba and Rodriguez can spice things up,7,11 September 2010,"This film attempts to pay homage to those B movies favored by drive-ins way back in the 50s and 60s. Only I was there and I don't recall their being like this. They were actually pretty boring for all the crappy writing and acting. This movie's much more entertaining though that's not exactly a high bar.Danny Trejo's a great guy, no doubt, and I can see why Mr Rodriguez would want to help him out with a leading role, but I'm afraid Danny's just too old to star in an action flick. He moves like a refrigerator and you're never sure all the lights are on upstairs anyway. But, never mind, apparently Mr Trejo has garnered a few friends over the years, and it pays off big time here. Try Robert De Niro, Don Johnson, Jessica Alba, Michelle Rodriguez, Cheech Marin, and even Steven Seagal and Lindsay Lohan on for size.The movie proper is middling entertaining but the high points are mostly Jessica's and Michelle's, not Danny's or any of the heavy hitters tagging along.

Maybe it's because of the hype that's being generated along with the apparent controversy tagged along with it. Or what. But I truly despise this film. Why? Because it lacks cohesion as characters are introduced and then suddenly disappear without warning(with the sole exception of the main character). The action scenes are tragically underwhelming what with the horrendously fabled MTV-style ADD editing that makes one cringe at the action, rather being thrilled by it. And Lindsay Lohan sticks out like a sore thumb, the one MAJOR weak point in this constipated, bloated mess. The saving grace of the film is the final battle between Machete and his evil boss. If you want a better action movie, watch the Expendables instead. Miles ahead of this piece of dog-poo-riddled trash. Avoid at all costs.

Finally an opportune time-slot came up and I got the chance to give it a viewing. I have to say it was everything I had expected and more. A lot more humour in it than anticipated which was very welcome, with one particular set of scenes featuring our hero and the bodyguards of one of the bad guys that I found very amusing. I find that sometimes these films take themselves far too seriously and that is usually to their detriment; not the case here. Although not as polished as I would have expected, I still liked it despite the rough hewn edges to the production. Decent performances all round with Danny Trejo doing a very decent job as the lead, Machete Cortez. Also on the good-guys side we had Jessica Alba as Satrana and Michelle Rodriguez as Luz, nice eye candy but without too much substance. Chief among the bad guys were; Robert De Niro as Senator John McLaughlin, Steven Seagal as Rogelio Torrez and Jeff Fahey as Michael Booth; the pick of these being Fahey, mainly because he had a lot more screen time. Over all I found it a very entertaining film that didn't tax the little grey cells too much. It's pretty gory so definitely not one for the squeamish; just remember to check your brain in at the door and I'm certain you'll enjoy Machete.SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDEDMy score: 6.6/10.You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",Machete

127,jamiedarlow-37510,Uncle Cortez finally has his starring role!,4,30 March 2020,"Its a pretty cool idea but executed better as a 3 minute short. The infamous Machete (Danny Trejo) is recruited to assassinate a senator but has to go on a brutal revenge killing spree when it turns out it was a set up by his former boss. It's great to see Trejo in a central starring role and clearly enjoying it lots! Rodriguez also has a lot of fun turning his grindhouse idea into a feature length b movie that knows what it is and doesn't pretend to be anything else which is worth respect in itself. Unfortunately it just isn't a massively fun watch and does feel baggy. It's grindhouse theme is okay but it's only the parts in that we've already seen in the trailer that exploit it to its fullest and the rest is surprisingly tame in comparison. Having said that, it isn't without it's pleasures! If you want to see Machete gutting someone then bungee jumping from their intestines out of a window, this is where you're going to find it! I think my favourite part was seeing Robert De Niro in poncho disguise hopping around and shooting people which was the biggest laugh in the film for sure. Michelle Rodriguez is also awesome in her role as Luz; she's just a badass who won't let anything get in her way! Robert's frequent musical partners Tito & Tarantula provide the Machete theme making for a pretty memorable opening title sequence.

128,jcbutthead86,"An Excellent,Entertaining,Over The Top Action-Thriller. Robert Rodriguez And Danny Trejo At Their Best.",10,11 October 2013,"Machete is an excellent,entertaining and over the top Action-Thriller is filled with great direction,a wonderful cast,amazing Action and a fantastic score. All of those elements make Machete a brilliant B-movie thrill ride and one of Robert Rodriguez's best films.Set in Texas,Machete tells the story of Machete Cortez,an ex-Federale who has been hired by business man Michael Booth(Jeff Fahey)assassinate Texas Senator John McLaughlin(Robert De Niro). But when things don't go as planned,Machete is betrayed and set up by the people who hired him and Machete wants revenge not only against the people who framed him but also against vicious drug lord Rogelio Torrez(Steven Segal),an old rival of Machete's. When Machete wants revenge and to clear his name all kinds of mayhem,chaos and madness ensue.In 2007,Machete was first introduced to film goers in the Quentin Tarantino-Robert Rodriguez double feature Grindhouse as Fake Trailer Machete,a great trailer that gave viewers over the top violence,gore and 1970s-80s exploitation fun. When Robert Rodriguez announced that he was going to make a feature film based on the trailer many fans of the trailer(including myself)wondered if Rodriguez can pull it off. Robert Rodriguez delivered and gave moviegoers the feature film Machete,a great slam bang Action-Thriller that entertains and keeps you glued to the screen for 105 insane minutes and has all of the makings of a Cult Classic. Machete is a fantastic movie that takes viewers back to the days of the revenge and vigilante films of the 1970s and 80s and gives viewers a no holds barred movie that pushes the envelope and is politically incorrect but at the same time you never take the film too seriously. What I also love about Machete is how the movie embraces it's B-movie exploitation spirit throwing in everything but the kitchen sink and the film goes so far over the top you never know what's going to happen next. I also love how the film greatly exaggerates everything whether it's the characters,Action scenes or it's style where nothing in Machete is true to real life and at times when you watch Machete it will feel like you are watching a living, breathing live Action cartoon. The over the top cartoon style of the movie adds the Humor and laughs of the film because the laughs and Humor are done in such a bizarre and weird way and there are moments and dialog in Machete that will have you in tears laughing thanks to it's demented craziness. The main character Machete is a classic creation from Robert Rodriguez because like many other great Anti-heroes he's a man of few words and he lets his Actions speak louder than words and lets his toughness,face and body language intimidate people. Also in the film the character Machete has such a legendary status where men are afraid and scared of him and Woman want to be with him. Where most Action heroes use Guns to help settle their problems Machete uses only one weapon the big knife known as a Machete and when the man Machete uses the knife he uses it in a brutal and violent fashion with heads rolling and blood spilling making the use of the Machete more powerful. Machete is a classic character you will never forget and will stay with you after you watch the movie. The Action scenes in the film are amazing and are done with such excitement and manic energy that Rodriguez has in lots of his films with so many gunfights and explosions happening all around. The blood and gore in Machete is messy and disgusting at times but you never take the blood or gore too seriously because the film is so wild and over the top you will laugh at the blood and gore. The ending of Machete is amazing and filled with lots of Action and intensity while also leaving the ending open for a sequel. A great ending.The whole cast does great jobs in their roles. Danny Trejo is excellent and iconic as Machete,with Trejo bringing toughness and grit to the role. Great performance by Trejo. Robert De Niro is fantastic and funny as Senator John McLaughlin,a corrupt politician. Jessica Alba is terrific and beautiful as Sartana,an immigration officer that helps Machete. Steven Seagal is delightful and over the top as Rogelio Torrez,a vicious drug lord. Michelle Rodriguez is wonderful,tough and sexy as Luz/She,a Taco truck who's a revolutionary leader. Jeff Fahey is terrific as Michael Booth,a corrupt businessman. Cheech Marin is funny and memorable as Padre,Machete's brother. Don Johnson is wonderful as Von Jackson,a vigilante. Lindsay Lohan does a fine job as April,Michael Booth's daughter. Tom Savini is great as Osiris,a hit-man working for Booth. Shea Whigham(Sniper)and Daryl Sabara(Julio)give good performances as well. Also,lookout for appearances by Twins Electra Avellan(Nurse Mona)and Elise Avellan(Nurse Lisa).The direction by Robert Rodriguez and Ethan Maninqus is brilliant and stylish,with Rodriguez and Maniqus always moving the camera and keep the film moving at a tight pace and also doing a great job with the Action scenes. Fantastic direction by Rodriguez and Maninqus.The film score by Chingon is wonderful,memorable and matches the energy and style of the movie. A fine score by Chingon.In final word,if you love Robert Rodriguez,Danny Trejo,Action films,B-movies,exploitation films or genre films in general,I highly suggest you see Machete,an excellent over the top Action-Thriller that is Robert Rodriguez and Danny Trejo at their best. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",Machete
129,TheHonestCritic,"Movies do not get any better, this is my favorite movie of all-time!",10,9 March 2019,"This movie is based off a fake trailer from the movie ""Grindhouse"" (2007). When I saw that trailer, I thought: ""this would make an excellent movie!"" Sure enough, dreams really do come true! ""Machete"" (2010), this film has everything I love in a movie. There's action, comedy, drama, a little romance, over the top moments, and most importantly a great entertaining story. I've seen a lot of great movies, but ""Machete"" fires on all cylinders, and then some! There's a great all-star cast, which can be a hit or miss with most films. But, in this case the cast works perfectly, and all the characters are utilized to their full potential. The soundtrack is also perfect. Sometimes you can have a bad movie with a good soundtrack, a good movie with a bad soundtrack, a bad movie with a bad soundtrack, you get the point. However, this movie has a great soundtrack and it is also a great film! The special effects are also well done for it's low-budget. The acting is also crucial for a successful movie, and the whole cast does a phenomenal job. When I first viewed this movie, I was a bit skeptical about Jessica Alba. She's been nominated for ""Worst Actress"" numerous times, and most of the time it's entirely unnecessary! But that being said, I was kind of worried that she might bring the movie down, but in this movie she's actually putting forth her best effort. Therefore, out of all of her films, she gives her best performance in this one. Steven Seagal is a great action star, but in this one he plays a villain. I thought that was neat change of pace! Finally, the man Danny Trejo himself. He is a great actor, and this role was made for him! I can't give this movie enough praise. I give it 5 out of 5 stars on my personal scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. Probably one of the coolest things about this movie is that it was done with a low budget. That just goes to show that you don't need a large budget to produce a great film. Props to you, Robert Rodriguez! This is one of those movies I could watch 100 times in a row and never get bored with it. If you haven't seen ""Machete"", go watch it, you'll thank me later!",Machete
130,Meven_Stoffat,Are you kidding me? This movie SUCKS,3,6 September 2010,"I have a question for a lot of the positive reviewers on here: Did you REALLY like this movie, or are you just gushing out of respect for Rodriguez??? I'm a Rodriguez fan too, in case you didn't know. Tarantino and Rodriguez are the kings of b-movies. They know how to make a good b-movie and their extensive filmography has shown. With Tarantino you have Kill Bill, Jackie Brown and Inglourious Basterds, with Rodiriguez you have Planet Terror, From Dusk Till Dawn and the king of all things ""Visually gorgeous"", Sin City. What I love about both of them is that while their films are indeed exercises in Style Over Substance, they're aware of it and don't take themselves too seriously.I still stand by Grindhouse as the most fun I've had at the theatre. Two great movies from two fantastic directors with some hilarious fake trailers thrown in there for the price of one. After ""Hobo With A Shotgun"", ""Machete"" showed. I laughed so hard! And then the news broke that Machete was going to be a full movie. I was excited.Turns out, some fake trailers should just stay fake trailers.As I mentioned earlier, Rodriguez's films are Style Over Substance. But they are aware of it, and don't take themselves too seriously, and for that, come off as awesome. Was this movie Style Over Substance? Yes. Did it follow its ""Don't take yourself too seriously"" rule? Well, it did... for the first 20 minutes.I was liking the first 20 minutes. Even as a gore hound, I was wondering if I should be eating during that scene! Then of course, we get the awesome betrayal scene and the hospital scene... I especially loved when Machete cut the man's abdomen open and used his intestine as a rope to escape through a window. I laughed!!! Then it went downhill from there.First off, Jessica Alba was annoying. Take her out of the movie and it wouldn't be different. All she does is just run around and scream the plot out loud. The most cringe worthy scene was near the end when she got up on the bonnet of the car and made that speech. That brought back memories of ""Robin Hood"" of earlier this year (you know what scene I'm talking about). Second, this film has too much plot in it, and too many characters. For a movie that's supposed to be a b-flick, this movie shouldn't be about political mumbo jumbo.The characters are a big letdown here. Or at least the representation of characters. Let's begin. ""She"" is a great character. About halfway through the film she is killed off... then near the end she survived!!! Or the Priest. He is a likable character too. Then he gets killed off 5 minutes after his first appearance. Or what about Daryl Sabara's character? He's a funny guy and he has (what feels like) 30 seconds of screen time... and yet he's one of the main actors in the opening credits!!! Bigger yet, what about the villain? WHO'S THE VILLAIN? Is it Segal, who has a total of 6 minutes of screen time, De Niro, or Fahey, who easily out of the three supposed villains gets the most screen time... except he dies 10 MINUTES BEFORE THE CLIMAX. Or Lindsay Lohan... why is she even in there, other than the fact that she's Fahey's character's daughter??? The climax is a total anticlimax. There's no excitement in the battle at all, it's incredibly dull and boring. Even the iconic bit shown in the trailer with the bike was underwhelming. And Segal's character's death even felt copped out and lazy.By the time the film was done, I was so glad I was out of the theatre. The film bored me enough with its slow pace. For a movie that claims to be an ultra gory action b-flick, there's about 10 minutes of action, 90 minutes of boring dialogue. This is supposed to be a b-movie, not some political crap. I like slow paced films, but not when they're supposed to be fun b-movies.Sorry, Mr. Rodriguez, but I think your days are numbered!",Machete
131,come2whereimfrom,A joke too far,5,8 February 2011,"So picture the scene, Tarantino and Rodriguez are sat around having a few beers and Robert in his drunken state has a brainwave, 'Quentin' he says 'remember that fake trailer I did between 'Death Proof' and 'Planet Terror' Machete?' 'Of course' chirps Quentin 'well I'm going to make it into a full film!' smiles Robert. Instantly QT's eyes light up and he switches his brain to random hoping to chip in some crazy ideas. 'What you got so far?' Robert pours another drink and smiles 'well it's going to have Danny Trejo init of course and I'm thinking loads of guns and over the top action'. 'Maybe you could get a few other names' QT necks a shot 'what about that guy who used to be in Miami Vice? Don Johnson and get Steven Seagal too that would be ace'. More beers flow and Roberts vision becomes more abstract 'you know QT I'm gonna get that guy who used to be in all those films about smoking spliff and Lindsay Lohan!' Laughing QT suggests that it should also have nuns with guns, Robert De Niro and even Roberts's wife, Robert couldn't agree more, it's starting to take shape now he thinks. A few more rounds and a few dozen more clichés and the two immature b-movie addled drunkards are ready to put the Machete abortion on to the big screen, oh dear. I can only assume that this is how this movie was formed because if any actual thought went into it then god help us. With such classic moments as Machete refusing to text message 'Machete don't text' he exclaims and then later when feeling an urge to send a text for the first time, and being offered help, declines with the line 'Machete improvise'. Do you remember the film 'Commando' starring Arnie? Well this is basically it with a dash of 'Once upon a Time in Mexico' and then rammed full of bad lines and even worse acting. I have no idea how they got this bank rolled and I'm afraid it's a case of when something was much better as an idea rather than a fully formed waste of everyone's time.",Machete
132,eberkerbatur,different movie but not good (5.3),5,16 December 2019,"Strange movie but not nice I think it has a different concept(comedy, action)this is what we should call this movie.
it would be a very bad movie if they didn't have the cast quite well anyway and I'm sure it didn't get that much attention",Machete
133,Ryan_MYeah,The movie is ridiculous... and that's a good thing.,7,17 March 2011,"Machete stars Danny Trejo in the title role, a former Mexican federal agent, who illegally immigrated to the US, where in the state of Texas, a ruthless senator (Played by Robert De Niro) is cracking down hard on all illegal aliens. When a businessman comes looking for Machete, he pays him to kill the senator, but is set up and sought after as a fugitive, but also takes shelter and help from allies, such as an underground group of immigrants known as ""The Network"".It's safe to say that Machete is by far one of the dumbest movies I've seen in years... but when your film is a spoof of exploitational B-Movies, written and directed by action enthusiast Robert Rodriguez, and features a cast including, but not limited to Jessica Alba, Steven Seagal, Michelle Rodriguez and Cheech Marin, do you really expect anything else? Derivative? A little. Ludicrous? Absolutely. But that's the whole point of Machete. It's just a really, REALLY fun popcorn flick.The cast is top notch, the film moves quickly, and the action and choreography are well orchestrated. Although, the film is not exactly for the faint of heart, because there's a lot of weird things in the film (ie. using human intestines for a rope, an army of tricked out cars, and single slash decapitations) that contribute to the film's bloody, but also entertaining tone. Like another nonsense 2010 blood feature, Piranha 3D, the film has no immediate desire to be taken seriously, and the film's over the top third act is some of the most fun I've had with any 2010 movie. Any die hard fan of bloody action movies should definitely check it out.I give Machete **1/2 out of ****",Machete
134,annevejb,Genesis Four And Walking On Fire. V1.01,10,4 July 2012,"From the comments and reviews here, Machete seems to be accepted as a fun fantasy story where the plot is not relevant and is not expected to make sense. I consider escapist fiction to be capable of being proper and relevant so I have no qualms about that view. I really like this story, I really like the Spy Kids series too and I also look to those as fun, escapist fantasy. This is the ninth Rodriguez feature that I have purchased so far and I hope that I will be able to purchase more. What follows just says that I consider the story to have real world meaning. *I have noticed a 'family theme' in all of the Rodriguez stuff that I have. Family was important to R. It was a positive and helpful thing to R. To him, family appears to be capable of being a personal religion and that theme is at its strongest in the first three Spy Kids stories. Me, retrospectively I did not have such a good experience re family, for me to believe or say other would be to act out of duty, I understood duties and obligation to family to be strong. When the 'family theme' comes up in these stories I prefer to go myopic and in this case I find that practical. In Machete it is not obvious, but it is there. Machete and the priest, Padre, who is a biological brother and spiritual brother, both being ex Federales. ICE agent Sartana and network leader Luz, biological sisters on opposite sides. Meantime, Luz and Michael Booth, on opposite sides but having an occasional fraternal link via food choice and words used. Meanwhile, Michelle Rodriguez not being biologically related to Robert Rodriguez, just fraternally bonded by them both being effective in the feature film world, In Machete, the 'family theme' is not as simple or as obvious as in the Spy Kids stories, I prefer it that way. * A storyline that does not make obvious sense. In Spy Kids, no problem. I can rate all of those. For the Mariachi series to be a trilogy I I needed to look to how symbolism was used. A pure Mexican start, but by episode three the hero is not only Americanised out of recognition, he is also relatively weak as a person. It is the USA law guy who is effective and the real person. So, the USA law guy in Machete is Sartana, an ICE agent on the way up and out, but she is also a pussycat, becoming a more effective pussycat. Just watch her glaze over because of Machete Cortez, cat in love. Rodriguez is starting to remind me of Roland Emmerich, and to some extent Simon West. Rodriguez and Emmerich both seem to feel a need to dive deeply into symbolism. But they seem to approach that from opposite viewpoints. I can accept the Rodriguez angle, but I consider Emmerich and West to be in opposite factions to me. In Machete I would place them alongside such as Von Jackson, the vigilante leader. For me to try to understand this story I need to look to theory that can and typically is misunderstood in really damaging ways, so it is not a very good way. The theory I look to is Genesis, chapter four. Also to the ones that She Luz helps as people who are chained to spend their lives walking through fire, New Testament symbolism. Rodriguez as attempting to write a sympathetic story about the difficulties that a leper colony faces in the real, everyday, world, Pentateuch symbolism. * I found an IMDb user review, Enjoyable Viewing From Ma-Settee, 3 May 2012, Author: pms-mith from United Kingdom, that made me look further. This recommends Death Proof, Planet Terror or Sin City for anyone who remotely enjoyed Machete. I found a Blu-ray of the theatre and extended edited versions of Sin City and find it to be a very different thing. I consider El Mariachi as central to Rodriguez's works. For me, Sin City links with Once Upon A Time In Mexico, them being scary stories that I prefer to only view the once. Sin City having a set of audio tracks adds to that. For me, Machete is in the opposite direction, closer to Spy Kids, all stuff that I can watch many times over. Some would only want to watch these the once, or not at all. Sin City actors: appearances by Brittany Murphy and Makenzie Vega, who I find amazing in easy and fun type stories on the level of Machete; with Sin City they are in rather different roles and in a story that I do prefer to avoid. Rodriguez has variety. Is it possible to tell, at the purchase point, just which category any particular feature of his is in? Paul McGuigan, Push and Wicker Park, poses the same problem for me.",Machete
135,D_Burke,"""Machete"" Is Not For Everyone, But It's Was Fun To Me",8,27 September 2010,"As I was in the theater watching ""Machete"", I could not help but see certain scenes and keep a list in my head of people who would hate this movie. When Machete (Danny Trejo) takes out the knife whose nickname he bears and cuts people's heads off, ""people who hate violence in movie"" made my list. When Sartana (Jessica Alba) takes a shower and leans against the wall in a way that millions of men probably fantasized about, ""most, if not all, women"" found its way onto my list. When Padre the Roman-Catholic priest (Cheech Marin) says ""God has mercy. I don't."" to a guy before blowing his brains out with a rifle, I couldn't help but mentally pencil in two other groups of people: Catholics, and people who hadn't seen ""Grindhouse"" (2007) when it came out in theaters three years ago.Well, I love violent action films, I think Jessica Alba is gorgeous, I am Catholic but am not easily offended, and I was one of a surprising few who saw the aforementioned ambitious tribute to B-movies of the 70's and 80's. Therefore, I enjoyed ""Machete"" a lot, but I imagine others would have to take it with a grain of salt.""Machete"", based on a fake trailer made exclusively for ""Grindhouse"" that director Robert Rodriguez decided to expand into a feature-length film, is not meant to be taken seriously. If anything, it's a clever film with a lot of great action sequences, intriguing characters, many interesting subplots, and a good story at its base. For starters, it also has an impressive roster of talented actors in it. There is an interesting mix of the usual Rodriguez players (Danny Trejo, Cheech Marin, Jeff Fahey), really good actors (Robert De Niro), notoriously bad actors (Steven Seagal, Don Johnson), and talented players that have made some bad film choices over the last few years (Jessica Alba, Lindsay Lohan). The funny thing is that, good or bad, most of these actors seem perfect fits for this movie, and work well off each other.Trejo may have been an action star if he came to fame in 1970's cinema. Nowadays, it's not unusual to see good looking celebrities like Tom Cruise and Ryan Reynolds headline action films. Thankfully, Rodriguez, like Quentin Tarantino (who co-produced this film, but for some reason, remained uncredited) saw something in this 66-year-old ex-convict, because Trejo makes a great lead for an action film. Just one look at him, and you may want to start running. He's rugged, doesn't take any crap from anyone, and it is what action stars should be. It's just too bad the villains in this movie are not aware of that fact, and there are many villains.There's Torrez (Steven Seagal), a drug kingpin who betrayed Machete while he was a Federale in Mexico. There's Booth (Jeff Fahey) who hires Machete to assassinate a Republican senator (De Niro) who's staunchly against illegal immigration. There's also a corrupt border patrolman (Don Johnson) who kills illegal immigrants with no mercy. Although Jessica Alba plays an INS agent, you really can't stay mad at her for long.Although ""Death Proof"" and ""Planet Terror"" found a separate following on DVD, ""Grindhouse"", which combined the two films along with fake previews, did not do well at the box office despite rave reviews. So the timing may have been bad for ""Machete"" had it not been for the controversial Arizona immigration law that coincidentally coincided with this film's release. Whether or not this movie can be seen as a Hispanic-American revenge fantasy is not up to me to decide, although Michelle Rodriguez's turn as Luz, who is suspected of aiding illegal immigrants, raises some interesting questions. The film does seem to forget that it's a parody of exploitation films of years past at times, but never ceases from being fun. Just as Rodriguez brought ""Machete"" from a coming attraction to a feature film, I hope Rob Zombie does the same for his ""Werewolf Women of the SS"" preview.",Machete
136,fcabanski,"Yes, No",1,3 March 2017,"As a grindhouse movie it's a 10. The acting is overall terrific - Alba is only pretty bad, which is very good for her. The action is terrific. The story is terrific - it's crazy, it twists all around the place, that's terrific.But the Hollyweirdos who made it couldn't help but throw in glorifying illegals and demonizing people who want a secure border in America. The political message is misplaced. But Hollyweirdos can't help themselves.""Don't take it seriously, it's exploitation...except people who are anti immigrant are racist."" Yes, I purposely used ""immigrant"" instead of ""illegal"". People in Hollyweird can't demonize those who want a secure border without lying. So the constant message is about people who are against immigrants rather than the truth - people are against illegals breaking into the country.The political message is a -10, so it pulls the movie down to a 0. 1 is the lowest rating. It's a 1.",Machete
137,Rindiana,A Blunt Cutlass,5,21 October 2010,"It's always the same with Robert Rodriguez's movies: For a while, the pulp hokum is quite a fun to watch, but from the midway mark on the superficial in-your-face shenanigans grow tiresome and repetitive.This over-the-top actioner - full of bloodletting and sexploitation - isn't his worst pic, though. If you enjoy violent mayhem, cheesy one-liners and (un)intentional bad acting from an illustrious cast, this is solid entertainment for about an hour, but as the situations lose momentum and their tongue-in-cheek attitude and since one's interest in cardboard figures is slight, anyway, the final reels, featuring a yawn-inducing showdown, prove to be too much of a good (or rather bad) thing.5 out of 10 handy intestines",Machete
138,bazmitch23,Meh-chete,6,28 January 2014,"Rodriguez is one of the laziest filmmakers today. He only makes low budget films and instead of building sets, he just shoots his actors in front of a greenscreen and puts lots of bad CGI in.Sure, he not only writes and directs, but he also composes, shoots and supervises the visual effects. Back when I was a teenager, I thought that was the coolest thing ever. But today, his 2000's movies look dodgy. They have a cheap home made feel to them that you can easily do today on Youtube. I prefer his 90's movies where he didn't have CGI and used old school effects.Machete does have some great action scenes. I loved the scene where Machete tears out the man's intestine and jumps out of the window using the intestine like a rope. But despite being an action film, Machete doesn't have that much action in it. Another problem this movie suffers from is that there's too many characters and sub plots going on. Instead of focusing on the main character, we have to have focus on 20 bloody characters. You'll forget what the film is about anymore.It's like Rodriguez said ""Hey, look how many famous people I can cram into one film."" That's all very nice, but there needs to be a reason for them being there. They all just come and go.The deleted scenes featured MORE characters.There are some funny scenes as well. I liked the scene where Machete was attacking the Hungarian guards and one of the just says ""I quit."" and gives Machete his gun. We get some nice fanservice such as the naked girl in the beginning, Jessica's shower scene and a topless Lindsay Lohan. The acting? Everyone just plays the same characters they always do. Trejo is the badass Mexican, DeNiro is the villain (whose accent keeps changing), Alba is the hot girl (and she's wooden as always), Michelle is the badass like she ALWAYS IS and Steven Seagal (despite playing the villain) is the same guy with one facial expression. This is the only film with Seagal I've seen, but everyone tells me that if you've seen one Seagal film, you've seen them all. Lindsay Lohan plays a drug addict. Gee, I wonder how she prepared for the role.There's a lot of bad CGI in this such as CGI blood and body parts being cut off that are obviously CGI. Nothing looks real in this film.Is it enjoyable? Errrrrrr........... well, it's not brilliant. It's worth watching for the fan service and action scenes. But as for the plot that is all over the place, look elsewhere.Also why didn't Seagal's character kill Machete in the beginning, instead of going on this quest for revenge even though Machete didn't do anything to him? I dunno. I showed the film to my dad who hated it. When he saw that there was going to be a sequel, he asked ""Is it going to be as bad as this one?""",Machete
139,tnrcooper,Machete don't text. Machete gets evidence.,10,6 April 2011,"Really incredible movie. Having read a lot of comments here, it's funny to read all the comments by white people (I'm also white) about the supposed racism of Robert Rodriguez. Rodriguez puts a face to the folks who may or may not immigrate. Numerous studies have shown that ""illegal"" immigration is actually a net financial plus, creating income, increasing tax revenues, and actually committing less crime than citizens. Rodriguez uses a controversial topic to generate the fire and passion which propel this movie. It is an obviously over-the-top film whose violence and excess is used in order to draw the attention of people to the meanness of the immigration policy of the US and to the fact that people who do emigrate are people who will not harm the US. I think critics of the film should remember that this film is a parody. However, parodies are made because reason and logic have been ignored and so it takes over-the-top material to engage people with a topic.The cast is unusual. Don Johnson is excellent as cold and heartless Minuteman-like leader, Von. Lindsay Lohan is April Booth, showing again that, as well as looking good, she can really act. Danny Trejo, never showing a shred of emotion and pitch-perfect as the larger-than-life and eponymous Machete. Robert DeNiro is reactionary state senator John MacLaughlin and shows that he cannot do a southern accent. Steven Seagal is sleazy drug-lord Torrez. The criminally under-appreciated Jeff Fahey is fantastically soulless Booth, MacLaughlin's primary business partner. Michelle Rodriguez is great, kicking ass and taking names as the leader of The Network-the organization which attempts to bring Mexicans safely over the border, and Jessica Alba looks incredible but really isn't much of an actress. She plays a Fed who becomes increasingly skeptical of the effectiveness of the policies she is paid to enforce. Last but not least, Cheech Marin who steals every scene he's in as a priest who gets some great lines, like ""God's forgiving, but I'm not."" The plot of the film is that Machete was a legendary cop in Mexico, but that after Torres kills Machete's wife and child in a drug bust gone wrong, Machete drifts for a while. Three years later, he is working as a day laborer in Texas when he is offered a substantial amount of money in what turns out to be another double-cross to help racists and drug-runners. When he realizes this, he exacts revenge as only he can, getting the girls, and many great one liners along the way.This movie isn't for everyone, obviously. There is copious gore and gratuitous nudity. If only there had been excessive profanity, I really would have been happy. Seriously though...you know if you want to see this film or not. I know that some of Rodriguez' films are exploitative, but I don't know that they are necessarily topical. This one is though. The acting is generally very good although the dialogue is sometimes a bit wooden. Then again, there are many great one-liners and the satirical point of the film is well-established, regardless of how great every line is.Bikes, vicious, crazy ways to die, blood, and some eye candy. Yeah, this one is probably for boys. And if you don't like the movie's politics, perhaps you should re-think your views on immigration policy.",Machete
140,mistoppi,Absolute gold!,8,20 December 2015,"Even though ""comedy"" isn't mentioned in the genres, Machete is definitely hilarious. It's partially ridiculously bad, but it's also incredible just because of that. If Machete had been made completely seriously, it would suck, but it's not. The characters are weird in a really charming way. Some of them are clichés that meet some really weird action video game - especially in how the characters dress. The actors and actresses are all well chosen for the roles. Well, that's mildly put when it comes to Danny Trejo. No one else could play Machete.The plot of this movie is very typical for a revenge type of action movie. It's obvious and predictable, but it isn't the plot that gives Machete its charm. It's the annoying one-liners which are so bad they are funny. It's the atmosphere and aesthetic, typical to Rodriguez and Tarantino. It's the variety of characters. It's a lot of things, but the plot isn't one of them. But we don't watch Machete for the plot, now do we? We watch it for it's value as a cult movie. Machete is absolute gold in its humour, atmosphere and violence. Along other works of Rodriguez, it's an instant cult classic. If a few severed heads and some guts don't turn you off, watch this movie!",Machete
141,masercot,Delivered,8,7 September 2010,"I am not the only one who wanted to see Danny Trejo star in a movie. And, the man did not disappoint. This was an enjoyable movie with a cast that could best be described as eclectic.Lindsey Lohan was probably the biggest disappointment. She isn't much of an actor and actually made Steven Segal seem deep by comparison. Jessica Alba was enjoyable as an FBI agent. Robert De Niro seemed like overkill for a part that could've been played by any competent actor.Make no mistake, this is a violent movie. The first five minutes give the view an indication as to how violent. Blood, brains and intestines are splattered every few minutes, only interrupted by some voluptuous nudity and smatterings of plot.But, it delivers as a grind-house movie, beautifully. If you are looking for brilliant acting or a tight plot, you will definitely want to go anywhere else; however, for a movie that looks as if it were taken right out of the projection room of a seventies drive-in theater, you can't do better than Machete...",Machete

143,colinrgeorge,Razor Sharp Exploitation,7,7 September 2010,"Robert Rodriguez is one lucky bastard. When he and Quentin Tarantino released ""Grindhouse"" in 2007, there was a lot of talk about how much money it lost. In spite of its well-known contributors and generally favorable reviews, the exploitation homage tanked, to put it lightly. The double-bill failed to reclaim even half of its $67 million budget over the entire international run.Maybe that's why I'm so surprised ""Machete"" got made. Or maybe it's my surprise at how much fun I had that's bleeding over—Who can tell? ""Grindhouse"" still ranks among my most memorable theater experiences, and ""Machete,"" a feature-length expansion of the faux- trailer that played between the two films, picks up precisely where ""Planet Terror"" and ""Death Proof"" left off.Here, Rodriguez co-directs with his long-time editor Ethan Maniquis, but for all intents and purposes, it feels like Rodriguez is pulling the strings. Double-dipping in the sometimes corny, frequently outrageous, and purposely campy lost and found of cult seventies B-movies is a weird choice for the director, and one that runs the immediate risk of overstaying its welcome. Fortunately, ""Machete"" earns its existence and then some with a deranged and offbeat mash-up of tawdry action, black comedy, and current events.It's no wonder Rodriguez, being of Mexican American dissent and having grown up in San Antonio, Texas, has illegal immigration and border control on the brain. But the way he creatively parlays today's hot button issue into the silly, cobwebbed genre film of yesteryear is his real stroke of genius. Granted, his sense of humor skews more slapstick than satire, with a levity that might annoy political purists, but it's all in good, tasteless fun.At heart, ""Machete"" is cinematic wish fulfillment for a social subset we've never quite seen represented: the Mexican day laborer. Machete (a grizzled Danny Trejo) is our near-mute anti-hero who's hired by an aide to a political hopeful, only to unwittingly stand as proxy in an assassination attempt—It's a shot in the leg that gives Senator McLaughlin (Robert DeNiro) the shot in the arm his anti-immigration campaign needs. The film eventually climaxes with an appropriately gratuitous (but admittedly overlong) Mexican/redneck battle royale.The overall successfulness of such sequences highlights exactly what I disliked about this summer's other action throwback, ""The Expendables."" All you can hope for from films like these is some modicum of creativity, and where Sylvester Stallone stutters, Rodriguez concocts a slew of inventive executions, the most notable of which involves the use of human intestines to propel down the side of a building. The dark humor also sets it apart; it keeps the film far and away more engaging than ""The Expendables"" in its often stifling self- seriousness.Weirdly, both films also feature gags about texting, and again Rodriguez mines the more entertaining moment. Sorry, Stallone, but it's tough to top a line like ""Machete don't text.""Still, ""Machete"" can hardly be called perfect, and to a large extent it represents a success for Rodriguez both redundant and unchallenging. It is a minor victory, to be sure, and yet ""Machete"" may be even better than the film that spawned it. That the director managed to repeat himself repeating the actual seventies exhibitionists and still come away with a handful of fresh surprises and laughs is remarkable in itself.Like ""Grindhouse,"" it isn't a film for everyone. If you take any stock in the box office numbers, apparently it isn't a movie for anyone. Sensitive stomachs need not apply, and those expecting more than a cartoon discussion of border control will be sorely disappointed. But that ""Machete"" exists at all is a minor miracle for the rest of us—That is, if you can muster any more enthusiasm for this particular, charming breed of unapologetic schlock.Maybe the biggest surprise of all was the depth of my own reservoir. Robert Rodriguez is one lucky bastard, and so is his audience.",Machete
144,thekyles99,"Forget he guns, using a machete is wayy more effective!",10,24 September 2010,"OK take that Expendables! Now to all the people that totally thought i was rocked out of my mind for saying The Expendables was the let down of the year, this is what I call a movie! Fantastic new release by director Robert Rodriguez. Robert Rodriguez's films are right up there beside Quenton Tarantino's on the way cool shelf. Stellar cast that is headed by the always cool and bad ass looking Danny Trejo. Danny is like the Clharles Bronson of today, you know that rough exterior looking face meaning nothing but business. The beauty thing about Roriguez's films much like Tarantino's is there ability to bring back wayy cool actors from days gone by and use them properly. Steven Seagal, Don Johnson, Cheech Marin to name a few. This feature is also shot in grainy 70's action style which makes it so much cooler. Now on to the storyline if you haven't seen any of the trailers for this cool flick pits Danny Trejo the hero in this film up against a racist Senator (Robert Deniro) who whilst preaching to the citizens that he will clean up boarder jumpers once and for all if elected by erecting a major electric fence around the borders of Mexico entering the States. He secretly operates a Sheriff (Don Johnson) and hired killers with badges to shoot and kill any Mexican families that are trying to cross over in the wee hours of the night. Steven Seagal in his first major heel role that i can recall plays an evil Spanish drug-lord who also wants control of the boarder crossers, his own people i might say as they come into his drug territory which cuts into his distribution. So he is pro Deniros campaign. Machete an ex Federale agent after losing his wife behalf of Seagal ends up getting hired for 150,000 to kill Deniro in what ends up as a double cross. In revenge for his fallen wife and his Mexican brothers and sisters he takes to cleaning up this dirty trio once for all. Loads of guns over the top violence and bloodshed leads to be one of director Rodriguez's best to date! A must see for any action fan of a director who knows how to use his cast. Take that Stallone!",Machete
145,haterofcrap,This movie sucked,1,20 January 2011,"Wow, this movie was pretty bad. I think that Robert Rodriguez should stick to children's movies (Like ""Spy Kids"") because those are the only good films he made.His other films are horrible and overrated...But this has to be his worst movie, being not only stupid, cheesy and boring, and also incredibly poorly made and filled with lots of stupid stereotypes (Yeah, I know that almost all the movies of Robert Rodriguez,have stupid stereotypes, but this is way worse than any of his previous movies...It deals with serious themes as illegal immigration in a incredibly ridiculous way, being both offensive and stupid) ""Machete"" is a terrible film. It was horrible from beginning to end, and it is one of the worst movies of the recent years. It was painful to watch, and I don't recommend it to anyone.",Machete
146,DustinRahksi,A forgettable exploitation film.,5,1 January 2013,"Films like this wear old real fast, same goes for you Robert. Come to think of it the only great film he made is Sin City, the rest were mindless action. These types of films can be enjoyable if done right, and by that I mean Tarantino. Of course Rodriguez regulars are back, Trejo getting the lead role. Not being a fan of Trejo didn't help my opinion on this film. With loads of extreme violence and nudity it should please people looking for their trash fix. The film was forgettable and nothing memorable or even remotely good happens. I like trashy horror films but I do not like trashy action films. This film is meant to be bad, and I get that, but it was Un-enjoyable. Watch it if your interested.",Machete
147,Fields201,Machete Don't Make Bad Movies.,7,7 September 2010,"Two of my friends in one day told me to go see Machete. The first friend said it had great action in it but mentioned that Jessica Alba had a shower scene. That was all he needed to say. But my second friend, who is Mexican, told me that the Mexican song that him and I sang for years was in this movie. That song by Texas Tornadoes: ""Hey baby, keep my soul!"" Well there's another reason.So with all these elements in place, I knew what to expect seeing Machete and Machete delivered. The film stars Danny Treyo (the coolest character actor in film history) as Machete. Like any good action hero, he likes to kill people with weapons, preferably with a machete and he's good at it. You can see from the opening that despite his build and lack of physical attraction, he will kill you with style. That's the Machete way. He wants to kill Steven Seagal, or at least what career he has left, and make people love him for a sequel.And why wouldn't he want to be in a sequel? Danny had been pushing for this film to be made and I can see why. If Danny was walking down Santa Monica and Jessica Alba walked up to him and asked him what he does for a living and he said, ""I'm a waiter."" What Jessica sleep with him? Would she give him a kiss? NO! But if it's scripted,she would slip that tongue down his throat. That's the beauty of being an actor, especially in Danny's case, he can slip Jessica the tongue.But what about the other actors? Let me get this one out of the way, Lindsay Lohan. The film depicts her as a brat who gets mixed up with the wrong people, throws up on herself, and sports a nun outfit to gun down people. Maybe Rodrigeuz was trying to tell her something. I must admit, she was pretty hot in this film, like that topless scene she had. But the biggest surprise to me, by far, is Michele Rodriguez. I never found her attractive before until this movie. Seriously, she was very attractive in it.But I was surprised by Don Johnson and Robert De Niro's performance. I didn't even know it was Don Johnson at first. It took a while to register. But he can play a cold villain. Then there's De Niro and he actually is acting like someone other than De Niro. He's got an accent! If there was any negative points to say about this film is that the pacing was a little slow for my liking. The film makes up for it with some interesting scenes and it was never really boring but it just seems like the setup for the next scene moved slower than what I liked. I also felt that the only real bad guy was Fahey's character and Seagal just seemed to be in the background the whole movie. He didn't seem like much of a threat.In closing, I'm glad I saw Machete. I will definitely buy it on DVD, at least to freeze frame Jessica's shower scene. That could be the whole movie for me!",Machete
148,krycek19,Machete sucks,1,23 January 2013,I know that this movie was only made because of a really cool fake trailer for this movie that wasn't going to be made when the trailer came out as part of Planet Terror.But this is insulting. Even though Rodriguez finances his own movies this movie was so low budget that several scenes was actually used again from the fake trailer instead of re-shooting those scenes.Oh and the movie turns out to be a politically correct preaching film about how poor illegal Mexican immigrants are treated in Texas. Yaaaaawn!!! There is almost no violence and Machete does not kill a single person in the entire film. Rodriguez should apologize this fans for letting them down like this.I guess he's trying to do that now by making a sequel called Machete kills but after this load of crap I will not see anymore Machete movies.I actually hate this movie even more than Taken 2.,Machete
149,lnvicta,"If you try to analyze Machete, you're doing something wrong.",8,14 March 2016,"Machete is one of the funnest movies I've ever seen. Right from the beginning you know this movie doesn't take itself seriously. It's essentially a live-action cartoon with A-list actors. You have Danny Trejo - the antithesis of a leading man - carrying the movie as Machete, the unkillable badass Mexican James Bond. If you want to talk plot, this is basically a revenge story. Steven Seagal kills his family, then years later Machete gets caught up in a political scandal where Robert De Niro is playing a cross between George Bush and Donald Trump, and somehow Seagal's character is pulling the strings. It's as amazing as it sounds. Then you have Don Johnson as the head of border patrol or something, mowing down Mexicans all over the place, and Jeff Fahey as one of Seagal's enforcers in Texas. Now you may be thinking, ""Four villains? This sounds more convoluted than Spiderman 3!"" And you'd have a point if this was a traditional action movie, but it's not. At all. It's a comedy more than anything with some ridiculous action sequences and gratuitous T&A all over the place. These characters just serve to forward the plot, and to give us some belly laughs, and somehow it all works beautifully.Jessica Alba is one of the officers assigned to this scandal. Michelle Rodriguez serves as the leader of a Mexican resistance, oh and there's Lindsey Lohan playing Jeff Fahey's ""religious"" daughter. There are so many characters and somehow they all fit the movie perfectly. All of the acting is great (well, Alba is never ""great"" but she serves her purpose and she's as hot as a supernova so who cares). But you can buy Robert De Niro as a corrupt senator, Don Johnson as this racist megalomaniac, Fahey as this hard-ass enforcer, and Seagal as a Mexican drug lord. Yeah. And the best part is they're all having a blast. It's pure mayhem going on, and you're not bored for a second. Danny Trejo as the title character deserves much props though. He just looks like a guy who would have a wide array of knives stashed under his vest, and the guy is making out with some of the hottest women on the planet. It's the role of a lifetime.Robert Rodriguez is amazing for making this an actual movie, and the cast are amazing for agreeing to be part of this project. It's so, so, SO entertaining. It's damn near impossible to sit through this movie with a straight face. I had a big fat grin throughout the whole thing. If you like silly action movies with fantastic actors and a surprisingly good plot, then look no further than Machete.",Machete
150,CrassActionHero,Machete Deserves Better,5,3 September 2010,"Who knew that a simple fake trailer from the ""Grindhouse"" movie would actually become a feature film? The trailer was fun and was awesome. Fast forward three years later and Machete is born.Danny Trejo is Machete, a former federal agent who is a rough vigilante, and really does not like the bad guys. Really. You don't mess with him, he will let you live, mess with Machete, and you die. Painfully.Storywise, don't be blown away. The plot is quite predicable and can be seen coming from a mile away. Though, this movie isn't looking for an award for best screenplay, so that is just a minor setback. The real treat here is, what else? Machete kills! Upon watching this, I could not help but admire Robert Rodriguez' craft. He has a awesome vision for a good bloody action packed smack down. Some scenes have you gasp, others have you jump, and overall have you roar at the stylish brutality. When it comes to R rated movies, Rodriguez is truly unique.Don't forget about a big cast of characters. Danny Trejo of course, who is nearly 70 years old, is a perfect choice of the title character. Lately, age does not mean jack. If you got the chops, then show us the strength of your bite. Also, Jessica Alba, Don Johnson, Robert De Niro, Jeff Fahey, all do just fine here. Cheech Marin is also awesome and really delivers the laughs. Michelle Rodriguez is in my opinion, is one of the hottest ladies out there and is used well here. And yeah, Lindsay Lohan. It is really obvious how she got this role. Let's just say it isn't a stretch for her. Last, Steven Seagal. Different seeing him as a bad guy, and he really has lost his action chops. Weird considering Danny Trejo is a lot older.The MAJOR flaw here is the politics. Whether or not I agree with them is not the question,(I don't) When I go see a movie, I want to escape from the world, not be swallowed in it. The politics are not everywhere, but it was told strongly and I just quite frankly do not want to hear from either side. I just want a good movie to let myself go in. Lay off the politics and stick with the action. With all is said and done, Machete is a good, bloody slice of brutal action topped with all the fixings and then some. This had the drive in style violence, but suffered huge to racist bullshit politics. Overall: Lackluster.",Machete
151,BrickNash,Without a doubt the best action film of the last few years!,10,27 November 2010,"When I heard about this movie I expected nothing more than a fun action ride that would keep me occupied for a few hours, but Machete is so much more.Let's just get this out the way, It's brilliant! You just can't deny it unless you are a complete movie snob who only watches historical epics or reruns of Casablanca (which I do but I enjoy a good action film!)The violence is superbly over the top with gore and guts flying all over the place but yet strangely it never seems out of place or (that) unrealistic. I think the film dresses itself up as a gung ho action film and it has all those elements and more (so much more) but look a little underneath and you will find a wealth of interest. The U.S./Mexico border part of the plot really took my interest and it's a strange yet great setting for an action film. Then there are the characters. I've always been a fan of Danny Trejo, he does make the perfect archetypal villain in films and even though he is basically playing the same character as in all his films, here it's been turned on it's head because he is a good guy. Now we have an ageing, rough badsass of a man who certainly is not a pretty boy but who can kick anyone into next week AND get's all the girls. this in itself is such a refreshing change to the usual chiseled and model like action hero's of today.The women themselves, while on the surface have been picked for their extreme good looks, can kick ass just as good if not better than the guys in the film. There is not one instance of the 'damsil in distress' theme in the movie. All the women are tough and driven as well as being easy on the eye.The action is nearly non stop but with enough peaceful moments to get you back into the story before more carnage ensues.The only criticism I had was with the end fight between Trejo and Segal. Here we have an ex-boxer and weight lifter against a man who was the first westerner to be awarded the title of Aikido master in Japan and who's fighting skills are second to none, yet it all seems far too short and not very impressive considering the choreography that these two could have pulled off.But this is a small gripe and the film is without a doubt the best action film of the last few years.After the disaster that was The Expendables Stallone Should take note, because THIS is how it's done. Blood and gore is fine but you were allowed to have a bit of time with the characters in this film, saw their causes, met family so you actually cared what happened to them.Great stuff!",Machete
152,destinylives52,Silly But Highly Entertaining,8,20 November 2017,"From the ""fake"" trailer that was in the ""Grindhouse"" double feature movie, ""Machete"" is the fully realized version, starring the incomparable Danny Trejo as an ex-Federale who winds up as a day laborer in the U.S. Picked by a man to assassinate a Donald Trump type politician (played by Robert De Niro), Trejo takes the job and before he can fire a shot, he is double crossed and set up to take the fall for De Niro's attempted assassination. Wounded and on the run from the police and De Niro's henchmen, Trejo is helped by an underground network of Mexican immigrants to get his revenge on those who wronged him.My most memorable, movie moment of ""Machete"" is the scene when Trejo goes to the house of De Niro's main henchman. Holding garden tools, Trejo tells the bodyguards that he is the new gardener. The bodyguards let Trejo pass; and one of the bodyguards says something like ""You ever notice how we let a Mexican inside our homes just because he's carrying garden tools?"" It's the funniest line in the movie.""Machete"" is a hyper-violent, often silly, fast paced, action/comedy that revels in its absurdity and glorifies the 1970s cheesy action/revenge flicks. Obviously not meant to be taken seriously, this movie is best viewed with friends as you munch on unhealthy snacks and drink unhealthy beverages. As a bonus to viewers, ""Machete"" has a surprisingly complicated plot for a movie that focuses on outrageous, bloody violence.Mannysmemorablemoviemoments",Machete
153,ThreeGuysOneMovie,Danny Trejo for the win!,7,22 September 2011,"Machete is over the top in all aspects and is a classic grindhouse B movie in the modern era. The movie stars Danny Trejo, as Machete, an illegal immigrant hired to kill a Texas Senator and when the man whom hired him sets Machete up, Machete goes shithouse. The violence is surreal and the plot is thin but with stars like Don Johnson, Jessica Alba, Michelle Rodriguez, Lindsay Lohan,Robert De Niro, Cheech Marin, yes I said Don Johnson, this movie was entertaining.Robert Rodriguez, whom has directed movies, From Dusk til Dawn, Once Upon a Time in Mexico and Sin City certainly has a flare for old Mexico, Danny Trejo, and over the top violence. I actually think that Rodriguez and Trejo are related. Rodriguez seems to put Trejo in a lot of his movies and he finally got to be the lead in a full length feature directed by his long time employer.The cast of Machete has a large rap sheet, many of the actors and actresses have had several run ins with the police and a few have spent time in prison. It is like Robert Rodriguez has a thing for criminal actors and actresses, just a thought.My final thoughts about this movie are this; this movie was entertaining and violent, with some cheesy comedy and one liners. It is not going to change cinema as we know it but it certainly was worth a watch and the only thing that would have made it better for me is if Tubbs made an appearance.",Machete

Blood, action, nudity, bad story, weird acting and washed up actors. That is what makes up this movie in a nutshell and it all works for it. This film had an interesting cast. Danny Trejo plays Machete. He was perfect for the role. He is only crazy looking person and he didn't have to say much, but when you hear the name Machete, you can picture him as the character. A great character was played by Cheech Marin; A priest wielding two shotguns. Could you ask for anything more? Michelle Rodriguez played a character called ""she"". She looked great for the part and really played up the character nice. You also have Jessica Alba who plays a sexy cop. Her acting was a bit strange, but the way she worked the character was great for the film. Tom Savini is an OK actor and always gets side roles. But the roles are always funny or interesting character. This make up artist really has it going for him. Now the four surprising people in the film. Robert De Niro was a big surprise. Usually I couldn't see him in a film like this and I know why. His character didn't fit with him too well. Then you have Don Johnson who really was a great character. Every close up of him wearing his cop aviators made me laugh. Then you have the famous Steven Seagal who I really can't stand. But some how, some way they found the perfect character for him and I really enjoyed his role. Last you have crazy Lindsay Lohan. How can the once teen star get back into the movies? They cast her as a messed up, sex crazed, woman with a gun. Plus she does do a few nude scenes. I guess that is the only way she could be in the film. I can never see her doing a serious role again, but strangely, this role did fit. So a very fun grindhouse film that is fun to watch and has some memorial action shots.

OK, illegals do lawn care, food service, labor. Seems no downside to illegals, except for criminal activity (not mentioned). The movie steps on the action brake and becomes a documentary and drones on about corruption, and politics and big business and illegal aliens.This should be a hit in the barrio.After I saw this movie, I was wondering about what I had seen. Then I read a review that put it in perspective.To wit: It is a fun, action packed, violent, bloody surprising movie.Some reviewers mention the one liners, which are copies from other movies.Can you beat Charlie Bronson in DEATH WISH when he confronts his wife's killer.Bronson: Do you believe in Jesus?Thug: yes..Bronson: Well, you are going to meet him. Or the movie titled: GOD FORGIVES. I DON'T. Didn't Cheech say this somewhere.What is original about Machete is the cast. Holy cow! This is the movie core. You will never see this many stars again in a B movie. And they are fun to see in their world of evil doing.I mean: Don Johnson, DeNiro, Lohan, Seagul, and others. Overall you will enjoy this film for what it is. Maybe even twice. Tongue in cheek action and thrills do deliver. Surprising it did not do better in the box office.Machete is a fun film, but DESPARADO is really a masterpiece of this genre. You have Antonio Banderas and Hayek. Wow! They bring a lot to this party.

Its treatment of the immigration issue is cartoonish, its plot is ridiculous, and its hero is a puerile wish fulfilment fantasy. Not all of this can be excused by its tongue-in-cheek grindhouse-tribute nature. But these are the same problems suffered by most of the rest of the box office, few of which are as great at being a dumb popcorn flick as this is.The action has the standard level of gore and explosions, but there's an almost graceful, balletic element to it, not to mention a sense of humour. Everyone is in on the joke, and while this could make things irritatingly smug, what happens is that it turns into something both ironically and unironically awesome -- this reaches its peak when Steven Seagal, in M. Bison regalia, shows up to double-sword fight with Danny Trejo. The worst thing that the past decades have done to the action movie is make it serious and angst-drenched (superhero films, as much as I love them, are significantly responsible for this). Machete shows us that fun movies should be fun again.This is still a big dumb summer movie that I probably won't remember after two weeks.

160,MovieProductions,You just *BEEPED* with the wrong Mexican,6,2 October 2010,"**1/2 out of (****)Walking into ""Machete"", I wasn't quite sure what to expect. Of course I acknowledged the fact that it was over-the-top stupidity, yet with positive critical reception. However, I wasn't sure to expect a good film or just a rather mediocre homage to the gritty, low-budget grindhouse movies. ""Machete"" is a little of both. While it's not a good film by any stretch of the word, it knows what it is and sticks with it. A plethora of films typically don't deliver what they promise and ""Machete"" isn't one of them. ""Machete"" is inclusive to gratuitous nudity, a high body count, blood spraying, a beefy Steven Seagel, and a 70's grindhouse feel to it. For that, I mildly recommend it. I haven't checked out the ""Grindhouse"" double feature, but I do realize ""Machete"" started out as a faux trailer for the aforementioned double feature. For a film like ""Machete"", it's almost impossible to walk out disappointed. I mean, sure, it's not a great film, but you get what you paid for. And really, is that such a bad thing?""Machete"", what originated from a faux trailer attached to the iconic ""Grindhouse"", now makes its debut to film. Machete (Danny Trejo), is a Mexican immigrant that kicks butt, gets the ladies, and makes no excuses. However, immigration is against the law, which leaves Machete in the dust. However, Luz (Michelle Rodriguez), supports anti-immigration and tries to get the law abolished. While Sartana (Jessica Alba), is with immigration laws simply because it's a law. Robert De Niro and Steven Seagel also join the Robert Rodriguez directed feature film.First of all, the film's performances are decent. For this being a B-film, the acting is surprisingly a notch better but when basing it as an A-film (which it doesn't intend to be), the acting is pretty much ""copy and paste"". Furthermore, the script is fine. The one-liners are pretty funny and the dialog doesn't try to be high art, which is a reliever to some extent. Moreover, the gratuitous violence and nudity don't disappoint. While there are far more heads flying off then clothes, both will suffice Grindhouse fans. To add to that, the style of this film definitely gives it that 70's feel. It doesn't have the typical Grindhouse scratches and aged look (however, the first five minute are like that), but it still recaptures that feel.While the pros outweight the cons, there are some flaws. First off, the pacing is offbeat. The beginning and middle are paced pretty well but the ending drags, which is a shame. Furthermore, for it being a Grindhouse flick, the money shots ran short. A Lohan scene and an intestinal scene doesn't cut it. I heard Grindhouse had numerous money shots, so why not this one?Overall, ""Machete"" is simply good fun and doesn't try to be anything it's not. While the performances and script are not top notch, they aren't suppose to be. Actually, for this type of film, it's a cut or two above subpar. Worth a matinée. If you even dare not recommend ""Machete"", then you've just *beeped* with the wrong Mexican!",Machete
161,80sHorror,Great action flick from the master,10,3 March 2012,"This is a great action flick from the master of the modern shoot-'em-up, Robert Rodriguez. Starring Danny Trejo as Machete, the greatest of Mexican Federales who loses everything to gangster Steven Segal. Becoming a drifter, he gets tangled up in a byzantine plot surrounding the transportation of immigrants across the Mexican/American border.Framed for an attempt on a Senator's life, and on the run from seemingly everybody, an entertaining tale of bloody mayhem and revolution is woven as Machete seeks to right wrongs and clear his name.Trejo is perfect as the hard as nails Machete, with monosyllabic dialogue and mean, moody glares. It's a magnetic performance. Jeff Fahey has fun as the somewhat seedy Machiavellian villain, Segal carries off his eviler-than-though character with aplomb and De Niro puts in a surprisingly good performance as the corrupt Senator. There is an interesting cameo from Don Johnson as the head of the local militia. Cheech Marin makes a welcome appearance as Machete's priestly brother, in scenes reminiscent of the scenes between Tuco and his brother Ramirez in the good, the bad and the ugly. Also worthy of note are Jessica Alba as the world's sexiest immigration official, and Lindsey Lohan as Fahey's dissolute daughter. Both manage great performances of quite some depth whilst simultaneously lighting up the screen as some much needed eye candy.With Rodriguez's trademark gory violence and insane weaponry, this is not a film for the fainthearted. It is however a film that delivers plot, action, beautiful women, action, gore, action, one liners, action, social comment and a little bit of action. It's great stuff, I loved it.",Machete
162,themissingpatient,MACHETE no good,5,9 September 2010,"First off, I'll let you understand where I am coming from by telling you that behind me up on my wall, framed in my living room is a poster for Grindhouse. It was one of the best experiences I've had in the theatres. Rodriguez and Tarantino have always been two of my favourite filmmakers, seeing them work together as a double-feature was mind-blowing fun! MACHETE was a fake trailer that played before 'Planet Terror' in the theatrical version of Grindhouse.Sadly, Machete doesn't deliver much more than the original trailer showed us. It's apparent Rodriquez had his fun with this concept already and has moved on, letting new director, Ethan Maniquis, piece together new footage with the old, leaving some serious plot-holes mixed with the bad editing, unlike 'Planet Terror' it didn't seem on purpose here, no longer making it funny.Another key element missing here there is no magic from Nicotero or Berger. Instead we get cheesy After Effects, no realistic over the top gore. No big shocks or surprises. We learn nothing more than what most of us saw 2 years ago.What Machete does have though are excellent performances by the cast. Don Johnson, Steven Seagal, Jessica Alba and Lindsay Lohan actually did some real acting here and coming from them - that's impressive in itself!",Machete
163,MovieZoo,Machete: A hatchet job like this turns politics into a love fest,7,5 September 2010,"You can take anything out of this movie and put anything into this movie because that was how it was intended. Rodriguez made a movie that appears to aim its sharp and blunted edge at anyone and anything over anyone and everything, you get to witness the worst at its worst. Don't look for the good, there was no good. The bad people are not on any one particular side. Everyone had their bad side. Honestly, the only thing good that came out of this movie was probably Rodriguez' satisfaction on blowing everyone's mind. Every actor was given a bad line and they all acted badly. It appears to me that was intentional. How can anyone see it any differently? The blood and guts was disturbing, which added to the bad because there was so much of it. And it was what one would call gratuitous, automatic and over-indulgent.The nudity was what one would call gratuitous, automatic and over-indulgent. Hmm, go figure. No love was lost here, there was none, not ever. The first nude scene was most likely intended to tell you not to hope for a serious love scene.One can go on and on trying to tell you what was wrong and what was right about this movie. I am not wasting my breath on that. If you were caught off guard, if you like dark humor, if you like blood, guts and gore then you stand a better chance of understanding what this movie was about and maybe you will even like it. Personally, I doubt I will see this movie again. I doubt I will see the sequel(s). Why would I? Once a movie that sets out to tear into morality so completely, successfully rips it to shreds, there is nothing left to see that anyone can add. Well, wait a minute, I didn't notice any aliens from outerspace or monkeys flying out of butts. Maybe something else can be added.Oh sure, the movie was about everyone being upset by the border battles and the politics and mayhem. But that was just an excuse to expose us all to a wonderfully developed warped imagination that made me laugh while tossing cookies. You have to put yourself above the political messages because both sides were ridiculous and stupid. Neither side wins in this if you don't let stupidity guide your sense of right and wrong. Save your politics for the real world. Just sit down at the movie like you were expecting to see something unreal. Rodriguez outdoes anything Tarantino ever did with Machete.I give it a 7 because Rodriguez figured out how to shock and repulse us all while making us all feel left out of the fun. I took a point away from it because of the excessive blood, Lohan's character was allowed to live, and because Lohan was in it.",Machete
164,edwardrevans,Brilliantly Bad,8,22 November 2011,"Well, this movie is something else, its not bad it a guilty pleasure because Machete has been made this way. From the Title to the cast to the genre ticking, you got Action, soft porn, violence, Politics and foreign language all shovelled into 1 heap of fun. If your squeamish then don't watch it, though the violence is not lingering and is on the comic book side and though brutal is laughable and brief. Robert Rodriguez knows exactly what he is doing with this movie, hes studied his source material and brought us what he intended to do, which is go see it and leave thinking you know what i kinda enjoyed that. With a flimsy plot, B-List cast, an A-Lister (De Nero) and continuity problems, all are intended to be there, why else would he have picked the likes of Segal and Tejo and Johnson, Rodriguez does'nt want an Oscar he is just reproducing the B-movies we have all seen and kinda liked.",Machete
165,metalrox_2000,machete is a true action film,10,13 January 2012,"There is a list I have. The list is exclusive, only a select few or on that list, and Machete is one of them.The list consist of films that I don't care how farm in it is, I'm going to watch it when its on TV. It could be all done save for the last half hour, I'm going to watch it.The film starts with Machete, then still a fed, on a case, hunting for a drug kingpin played by Steve Seagall, making his debut as a pure villain. Machete, much like the anti-heroes in Robert Rodriguez's other films, is forced to watch his wife be brutally murdered. The scene plays out in the opening segment.When we later find Machete, he's slightly down on his luck, when he is approached by Michael Booth, played with evil delight by Jeff Fahey. The plan Booth hatches is for Machete to hatch a assassination attempt on the congressman that Booth works for, Sen. McLoughlin (Robert Deniro), Machete(Danny Trejo) shoots the senator in the leg, only to learn he himself is targeted to be a martyr so that the senator can conspire with a group of anti-immigration bigots led by Von Jackson, played with chilling effect by Don Johnson, playing against the type we are used to see him play. Machete is aided in exposing the plot by a rogue agent named Sartana (Jessica Alba), and a mysterious woman named Luz (Michelle Rodriguez). The supporting cast features fine performances from Lindsay Lohan, Tom Savini, Shea Wingham, and as the ill-fated priest, Cheech Marin.The movie is amazing one of Robert Rodriguez gems, and the action is fast paced, and the soundtrack helps create the mood and setting of the movie. Yes its a little violent, but the violence is never not justified. And simply one of the best films released in 2010",Machete
166,bjones,A wasted dollar,1,20 October 2010,"I made the mistake of letting a friend talk me into going to see this. This is a very thinly veiled Anti-American, Pro-Illegal Immigration propaganda piece so badly made the political message is all that endures the stench. The plot is a continuous litany of trite clichés seemingly so deliberately patched together they may as well have used duct tape, all supported by a large cast of extras from Low Rider magazine. There isn't a moment of originality or, for that matter, quality to be found. It's not even executed well enough to be considered a satire.The most surprising thing is that the small collection of actors who are supposed to be actually able to act seem to have suspended their abilities in this ""film"" to the point where I almost wondered if look-alike's had been enlisted to put a false face on the whole endeavor. That list begins with Robert De Niro and also includes, Lindsay Lohan, Cheech Marin, Steven Seagal (although his acting ability has always been open to speculation) and Don Johnson. There were only two performances that would pass muster as being close to a genuine effort, those being given by the ever lovely Jessica Alba and the alluring Michelle Rodriguez.I should, perhaps, mention the top billing is for Danny Trejo, who gives a very wooden, unbelievable performance. Luckily, so much around him is so bad his performance will blend in with the rest.De Niro turns in a laughable performance as a bad-cliché of a conservative, stereotyped politician. Lindsey Lohan, who has not exactly been the darling of the press of late, played a fledgling internet porn actress. There is a scene where a bad body double tries to insinuate she's Lohan topless but it's very obviously not her, which may disappoint some of her adolescent male fans.Alba played her role as an ICE agent more-or-less straight enough, if a little tongue-in-cheek, so as not to embarrass herself. Her legions of young male fans will at least be rewarded by a nice, brief, extremely gratuitous, implied nude scene she decorates with elegance. Thank you Jessica ...The most praise I have for any of the company here is for the very watchable Michelle Rodriguez looking the best I've seen her since Blue Crush. Her character is almost as over the top as Trejo's, but she carries it off with far more class and talent; especially when she appears near the end in her black goddess of revenge costume, complete with black eye patch and attractive black bikini top. She makes a nice poster girl for revolutionaries everywhere.If you don't see this ""film"" you're not missing anything you'd regret.",Machete
167,imdb-19548,Preachy but a little amusing.,4,25 June 2011,"When you see the cast you can guess this will be slap-stick, you aren't going to get quality acting from them so it better be simple and for the most part it is.The plot is idiotic, intentionally I assume, but the pace is quick.Fahey and Trejo are OK as far as acting is concerned, standard action film stuff but delivered well. Seagal, as expected, sucks all the charisma and fun from the film when he is on screen but thankfully his part is very small.The jokes are good but there aren't enough of them. Some of the action sequences have good visual gags but a lot of them see clichéd, they are completely over the top and unbelievable.The main problem with the film is the preaching, if you want to talk about serious immigration issues don't do it in a b-movie, it jars badly making you instantly reach for fast-forward. On top of that the preaching is done by Alba and Rodriguez who are clearly not in the film for their acting ability and the lines, which are bad, are delivered really badly.Very light entertainment for when you have nothing else to watch, or for use as a drinking game!",Machete
168,The-Last-Prydonian,"Flawed but deceptively witty, intelligent undemanding self referential fun as homages go!",7,1 December 2010,"Somehow it would seem appropriate that ""Machete"" the slightly subtle but affectionate lampooning of the exploitation thrillers of the seventies gained It's roots from one of several pesudo-trailers that featured in the Tarantiono/Rodriguez collaboration ""Grindhouse"". Although wisely unlike ""SS Werewolf Women of the SS"" or ""Thanksgiving"" Rodriguez has chosen to make something of this recent pet project. Casting regular and dedicated cast member, the fittingly leathery faced, time worn Danny Trejo as the titular protagonist allowing the actor to take centre stage for once. ""Machete"" is by contradiction a dumb, loud celebration of a bygone age of Americana while also being witty, knowing and self-referential.It's safe to say that Robert Rodriguez is American/Mexican cinemas closest answer there is to Tarantino a man who I can assume he has partially been inspired by and aided him to some extent in his rise to critical repute with a solid fan-base. Style akin to Tarantino is what permeates a film that chronicles the brutal and bloody tale of Federali officer Machete Cortez. An honourable cop who paradoxically is also unflinchingly savage when forced to met out his own brand of justice. He is after all as the film with a lack of anything tenuous states is is a maverick willing to buck authority when necessity dictates. An act that leads to his seeming downfall when betrayed by his former boss who has allied himself with the merciless drug lord and socio-path Torrez played by an ever ageing Steven Seagal who has seen better days. Left broken and battered and emotionally scarred no doubt after witnessing his wife being decapitated before his very eyes. The movie skips three years after It's prologue to north of the border Texas where we find Machete scraping a living, performing yard work until an offer falls in to his lap from sleazy political aide Michael Booth (the criminally undervalued Jeff Fahey). A man who offers to pay him $150,000 to assassinate U.S. Senator McLaughlin (an ever reliable and funny Robert DeNiro). A politician whose policies on immigration are rubbing a lot of illegal and legal immigrants up the wrong way. Of course as with the efficiently hackneyed plot might allow nothing is quite what it seems and Machete is enveloped in to a murky conspiracy with a a beautiful U.S. Immigration officer (Jessica Alba) and tough feisty immigrant freedom fighter Shé (Michelle Rodriguez).Although it contains the bear semblance of a plot, ""Machete's"" story merely serves as an excuse to push forward what is essentially a somewhat deceptively brainless send up. Something although done before is not any less entertaining as a result. Unapologetic in his OTT handling of the more violent aspects of the film and with fluid direction and a pace that runs smoothly and ably abetted by mainly solid performances by a fairly strong cast. Rodriguez knows what his core audience is after and he pretty much delivers in spades. If gratuitous violence, blood, guts and entrails with a light peppering of sex and nudity which were a hallmark of seventies exploitation films like ""Foxy Brown"" are the order of the day then you won't be disappointed. The Mexican auteur who's career in my opinion has been of one which is a fairly mixed bag delights and revels in the ludicrous almost cartoon world he himself has conceived. A world where an ageing, grist-led Federali is seemingly indestructible and can incapacitate or eliminate a horde of heavily trained gunmen with only a hand held machete as his weapon of choice. And in which such eye popping scenes which include one stand out moment where in desperation our hero does something hilarious involving a disembowelment will either make you simultaneously cheer and laugh in wonderment at the madness of it or just make you shake your head in bewilderment. Personally I was of the former.Morosely however Rogriquez's notorious lapses in to self indulgence occasionally take precedent. Certain action sequences and plot twists occur that are not only a tad laughable but are also too contrived and nonsensical for words to describe. Coherence is given a wide berth in exchange for thrills and to forward It's straight forward simplistic narrative. While the inclusion of Steven Seagal, an actor with as much emotional range as one of his samurai swords when It's blunt smacks of cynical self referential casting. His performance is practically one note although he does manage at times to be a bit convincing in the taunting, sadistic antagonist stakes. Particularly when the film shifts in to It's final explosive act where Rodriguez practically throws in everything but the kitchen sink to mixed results.The rest of the cast are mainly decent, Jesscia Alba while of course effortlessly sensual and the figure of most men's desires is competent enough (although I can't help but wonder if she was cast more for her aesthetics rather than acting talent). Michelle Rodriguez makes for a memorable presence as Shé. DeNiro and Fahey are more than sufficiently smarmy, calculating and morally repellent in their respective villainous roles while Lindsay Lohan as the latter man's tempestuous and promiscuous daughter is revelatory. Proof if any be needed that there is more to her than the score of hollow mundane teen flicks (with the notable exception of ""Mean Girls"") that she has been lumbered with. And who can forget Cheech Marin's amusing turn as Machete's ass kicking brother and man of the cloth who brings a whole new meaning to divine retribution.Flawed as it might be ""Machete"" is still a solid popcorn flick with no real pretensions to really speak of. With Danny Trejo fittingly po-faced and sardonic as the movies tough title character I can think of worse ways to spend an evening at my local multiplex. It might not win any awards but it no doubt will win It's share of fans.",Machete

Machete is a man's film, everything from every did wrong, got wrong done to, revenge movie. It's awesome and just the right amount of corny that you know was intentional.EPIC.Also Lindsay Lohan is in it to my surprise. I knew about Don Johnson (aka Nash Bridges), Jessica Alba, Michelle Rodriguez, and Robert De Niro. But you get to see Lindsay topless with her face in the same frame so you know it's not a body double.It was everything I wanted. I think I just killed my inner feminist, because this movie is the reason why I would ever want to be a guy. Because guy movies are far better than chick flicks.All the chicks are super hot, but not helpless It's funny with enough seriousness to kick buttnessAlso I noticed that Daryl Sabara is in it ALSO known as the brother in the Spy Kids film series, which sucked Ironically Cheech was in that as well. Daryl plays a adopted Mexican, a white kid fighting for the rights of his fellow Mexicans.It's what every action pure entertaining film should be: AWESOME.Lastly:Jessica Alba's character:""Why didn't you text me?""Machete (Danny):""Machete don't text"" I know what you mean my dear friendAlso I never thought Michelle Rodriguez was ever that hot in all the other movies she's been in BUT DAMN an eye patch and minimal leather makes her the ultimate hottie.

It currently ranks as #2 of my top 10, but I have to say I haven't seen The Town yet, and I can say that it slightly topped Toy Story 3 for me, even though that's a pretty dumb comparison. People are dissing Machete for being cheesy and over-the-top violent...which was basically the whole point of this film. The film is an homage to 70's, B-Movie action flicks. Heck, I'm 14 and I understand that! (The film is 13 + in my province). Many scenes had me and a friend cracking up in laughter, and the same goes for the rest of the audience, around 2o or 25 other people at my late night Thursday screening, with most people being generally middle-aged men and teenage boys, along with three teenage girls and a young woman. Everybody laughed, everybody had fun, and everybody was talking about how much of a great time they had when the movie was over.Machete is a light movie, it doesn't have much of a story besides Machete trying to get revenge on the people who double crossed him when he was trying to assassinate the senator. If you've seen Robert Rodriguez's Planet Terror, you probably saw everything you had to see story wise when the fake trailer aired. There are a few twists and turns, and the story itself, while being very very slight, was very captivating. Don't walk in there expecting a Tarantino movie with a genius script, Rodriguez's film exploits violence and does it in a very amusing way.As for the cast, Danny Trejo is incredible as Machete. After around 25 years of career only having minor or supporting roles, Machete is Danny Trejo's first leading role, and you can't imagine any other actor portraying Machete with such intensity. On side notes, Michelle Rodriguez was also pretty good, Robert DeNiro, Don Johnson, and Jeff Fahey were also excellent, the best side performance being by Cheech Marin however. Jessica Alba wasn't half bad, and so was Lindsay Lohan. In all, the acting was above average. Danny Trejo, however, could win the best performance by an actor in a leading role - comedy or musical, at the next Golden Globes.The action scenes were very bloody and gory, to the point of exaggeration, but they were funny and let the audience have a very good time. If you have a night to spare and you want to go to the movies, Machete is the type of movie that you walk in with your popcorn and drink, and you don't ask yourself too many questions.Go watch it now, it makes me sad to see this film flop, and it's not too late to go watch it.

However, the problem with Rodriguez is that he has a knack to overdo things. I mean it's cool to have a famous actor play the bad guy, but here we have evil Robert de Niro, evil Don Johnson, evil Jeff Fahey ánd evil Steven Seagall. And the orgasmic finale is so full of bizarre and cartoonesque brutality that all subtlety and credibility is lost. Of course, Rodriguez doesn't have any intention to be subtle or credible, but he could at least adhere a bit more to the adagium 'less is more' to create a smoother movie experience (which led his buddy Tarantino to absolute stardom). Still, Machete is much better and for sure a lot more entertaining than 90% of what is produced these days, so we shouldn't be too hard on Rodriguez.

I have no problem watching the brutality - that is not the point. But I fail to find it funny if 3 heads are cut off at the same time. It only makes me shake my head in confusion. I am a huge fan of black humor, as long as the humor is black, it may be as brutal as it wants to be. Robert Rodriguez humor barely is black, it's creative gore - nothing more.So this is a parody of action movies? To me personally, this has been a quite normal Rodriguez movie. To me, there is not that much of a difference to Desperados and other movies of his. There, the story sucked too, everything was full of absurdities and felt totally ""senseless"". Rodriguez movies are pure entertainment, nothing more. And if this movie is a parody, it can only be a parody of Rodriguez own movies. It has way more in common with those, than with average action flicks.As said in the headliner, I still have been entertained.

And you gotta appreciate that.A bit preachy, it's understandable that Rodriguez would use a heavy theme of injustice that's done to the illegal immigrants that enter the U.S. from Mexico, which is definitely a non-fictional issue, but the movie portrays helping illegals into the country as heroic and honorable, which is a quite a biased perspective.",Machete

The look and feel of the film is right, the violence is pretty awesome and Danny Trejo is always great in whatever he does. But the whole movie just ends up being a total drag.

182,d_art,"'Machete' has much style, despite jumbled plot",7,5 September 2010,"Based on a fake trailer released along with the double-feature Grindhouse, in this actioner directed by Robert Rodriguez and Ethan Maniquis, Danny Trejo plays Machete, a highly skilled ex-Federale from Mexico looking for work, who is hired by a man named Booth (Jeff Fahey) to assassinate Senator McLaughlin (Robert De Niro). He is soon betrayed by his employer and he plots revenge with the help of resistance fighter Luz (Michelle Rodriguez), ICE Agent Sartana (Jessica Alba), and the shotgun-toting Padre (Cheech Marin).This film has been referred by the producers as a Mexploitation film, a take-off of the idea of the Blaxploitation films of the 70's. Few will argue regarding the dated quality of many of the films of this genre—I mean, they're campy (and amusing) for a reason. Much of the love for them is steeped in nostalgia. The clothes, the graininess, the lingo, camera zooms, badly-done gore, and the extreme close-ups remind us of the time when people handcrafted everything and made the best of their low budget. Machete may not have had to work with such a low budget, but it aimed for and certainly achieved the look, style, the feel, and content of an exploitation B-movie. There's campy dialogue, generic plot, cheesy gore, and nudity. There's plenty of action involving blades, guns, and gardening tools. This is all done tongue-in-cheek, with unlikely coincidences and unlikely reversals. The bad guys are not too complex, just the way we would expect them in such a film.The film starts off grainy, like a 70's film. The drug kingpin Torrez (Steven Seagal) has killed Machete's wife and kids. I couldn't help but smile when Torrez, in B-movie fashion, instead of shooting Machete right there, decides to burn the building where he's been tied up (See my review of The Girl Who Played Fire). Machete, of course, escapes through the window. Then comes the cool-looking colorful title sequence.Danny Trejo, in his first lead role, is what makes this film highly watchable. He has screen presence. He is noticeable. His whole look and deadpan expression is perfect for this character. He is like a force of nature—nothing gets in his way. Simply, no character looks quite like him (except maybe Lobo from the DC Comics). His portrayal of Machete may not be complex or subtle, but we like his unwavering, stubborn toughness. Michelle Rodriguez is certainly not unfamiliar with playing tough chicks, and she is in usual good form here as Mad Max-style resistance fighter, Luz. The beautiful Jessica Alba, however, isn't very convincing as a federal agent--she just isn't intimidating. I suppose one can argue that that would make her the right fit for a B-movie (which often tends to have hot women with less-than-stellar acting). Jeff Fahey is diabolically fun to watch as the villain, Booth. Steven Seagal plays the drug kingpin, Torrez. While it's hard to see him as a Mexican kingpin, he is generally playing a bad guy version of himself, which, honestly, is all we can ask, want, and hope for.The action scenes are a lot of fun, especially whenever we have Machete wielding his machete against a group of baddies. He is quick. Things get bloody. Like a samurai film, limbs get chopped off and go flying with old-fashioned fake blood. The story itself is mostly silly, which involves resistance fighters, a priest turning into a shot-gun-wielding vigilante, and odd coincidences. There are also political issues abound, mainly regarding illegal immigration. Admittedly, the film doesn't always cohesively work together with its mishmash of many scenes and gimmicks crammed in, which can make the whole feel a tad banal, thus losing some of its tension and buildup even if they may be cool to watch.Overall, I enjoyed Danny Trejo playing Machete, and ultimately, he makes the film worthy of viewership. The fights are fun to watch. I enjoyed the quirkiness of the humor. The characters are fun. The visuals are nice. The plot tries to do many things, which I felt didn't come together as a whole. Perhaps it's the constant pace of the film, but it felt like a series of ongoing events, which didn't really stand out after a while--they often felt similar to each other, more visually interesting than engaging. Whatever criticism one can think up, I suppose one can always counter with ""that's how B-movies are supposed to be."" It's perhaps true, then again, many B-movies also often came with a cheaper ticket price.My Rating: ** ½ out of **** For more of my reviews, you can also follow me on http://twitter.com/d_art",Machete
183,montera_iulian,Disappointing Process of Filmmaking. It's enjoyable for fans of the specific genre but in time will lose much of the credits received at the moment,5,23 September 2010,"First of all I want to state one thing: I didn't enjoyed the movie like others did but I completely understand people who enjoyed it: Richard Roeper, my favorite critic loved it so.... It's that type of movie that you either like or dislike and from my point of view I just can't say if it's a good movie or a bad movie. So, don't hate on my review if you liked it but jump on the band wagon if you hated it. It's a personal opinion so act like it. I The things that I was disappointed in were mostly the story and the special effects. It lacked in both and both were needed. The story is full of clichés, cheesy lines and mostly bad dialogue. Other than that, the explosions, the fired-guns or the broken walls were done terribly and honestly I don't care if it's meant to be that way to look more 80's-90's. I just didn't liked it and that's just me. The only good visual effects were the cuts, bruises and heads blown-off. They were hilarious and fun. What I didn't liked also was the score which was not balanced very well. The cinematography was nothing new, the camera-work is above average for a Rodriguez movie. I was expecting something else. I also didn't get Jessica Alba's acting. I know she's not a real actor but it was so off the hook... I just couldn't stand her but I did stand her leather boots at the end of the movie. Another disappointing thing was the action-scenes which were ridiculous. I mean intestines? Switching a machete into your stomach and talk half an hour with the machete in it?... I'm sorry, I like Rodriguez, I loved Grindhouse but I think the guy just lost it for a moment. He really needs another Grindhouse at least to get back on my ""must-watch"" list. It was just stupid. But enough with the bad things about it... let's talk about the good things.The acting was pretty good for a movie like this and besides Alba everyone did a good job especially Danny Trejo, Jeff Fahey or Steven Seagal. Most of the hand-to-hand fights with sharp blades or machetes were done great and that I enjoyed. I think the fighting-choreographer (which I think it was Seagal) did a great job. I liked a little bit the tension in the movie but still it was not built properly. Other than being a movie that it has goods and bas I don't really judge anyone who loved it. I just didn't and I think it's an overrated movie that in time will lose much of the credits received right now.",Machete
184,EchoMaRinE,The Fake Kill Bill,5,23 January 2011,"I call this movie as The Fake Kill Bill with a weak story and weak acting. I read some of the reviews and as usual, a lot of people wrote without watching. Some directors have a strange fun base that votes blindly. Machete is a movie that I wouldn't dare to watch if I had seen it on TV. The plot is super crappy, which looks like written by a 10 year old boy. I have no idea what De Niro was doing in this movie. The whole movie is based on butchering people. The story is politically distorted and pointless, the main character looks so emotionless (showing no facial expression doesn't mean you look cool)and out of every weird idea this movie is based on, supporting illegal immigration is portrayed as a heroic act. Moral of the story, if you like movies with a lot of blood, give it a try but you better lower your expectations.",Machete
185,alexcomputerkid,"While it's not the best film from Rodriguez, nowhere is it the worst either.",8,29 July 2013,"You could say I grew up with Robert Rodriguez movies. I've sat through all of the Spy Kids films when I was little guy. As a pre-teen, I liked the forgotten The Adventures of Shark Girl and Lava Boy and saw it at a drive in. As I got older, Rodriguez' Planet Terror turned into a favorite with Machete coming out in 2010.Machete follows Machete Cortez (Danny Trejo) on a story set on the Mexican-American border. Machete is a former Mexican Federal who is set up in a complicated plot involving the attempted assassination of a U.S. Senator. An interesting cat and mouse game follows.The highlights of this movie is the action. As he did with Planet Terror, this movie is shot in grindhouse style that gives off an old style. The atmosphere is different and the cast includes familiar name such as old star Steven Seagal to Lindsay Lohan.Another highlight of the film has to be Danny Trejo. He's a guy you can say never turns down a role but regardless, he does a good job here. His character has many qualities and Trejo portrays it all very well. A very rough character that's not in Hollywood often.The big flaw in this movie is the CGI. They are very poor and cheap and the film definitely could have used better effects. Machete also does get around very easily for the character he is. With a film that surrounded by so much though, it's comes as only small flaws.Machete is a fun solid film that should not be overlooked. While it's not the best film from Rodriguez, nowhere is it the worst either.",Machete
186,Legendary_Badass,"Masquerades as low budget, sound effect lifting, testosterone-piquing throwback",4,3 September 2010,"Veteran character actor Danny Trejo takes a rare turn as a lead in Machete, playing the eponymous ex-federal agent of Mexico hellbent on destruction. Naturally, he has a vendetta with a drug lord named Torrez (Steven Seagal). But Machete is also caught up in a vast conspiracy involving illegal immigration led by senator McLaughlin played by Robert De Niro, which has him on the run from the law. Helping Machete dispense justice are a taco vendor named Luz (Michelle Rodriguez) who happens to be the leader of The Network, a groups of freedom fighters and special agent Sartana (Jessica Alba).The credits say Machete is directed by both Ethan Maniquis and Robert Rodriguez, but the marketing campaign gives the credit to Rodriguez who also serves as co-writer and producer. It's also no secret that Machete stems from a fake trailer featured in the Grindhouse collaboration and it is suitably decadent with its vulgarity. Just about anything imaginable is on the table, including numerous CGI enhanced lacerations, intestines as rope, and a generally abusive use of female anatomy that needs no more detail.Despite featuring a number of stars, some has-beens, retro-look techniques, and violence that would make the jaded shudder, the most that can be said for Machete is that it isn't boring. It's also not much fun. There is too much exaggerated violence to take the world seriously, and the violence in itself is not hysterical despite its outlandishness. The end result is a confusion between what should be funny and what should be intense.The political message is obvious, clearly Rodriguez wants to establish freedoms for Mexicans residing in the USA illegally. As expected, any logical argument for the opposite is lampooned to the extreme. The character that best illustrates this is Von (Don Johnson), a minuteman border hound who takes the law into his own hands with the help of his good ol' boys. So yeah, if you oppose enforcing immigration laws, you must be a redneck racist.Danny Trejo isn't wrong for this part. I've seen him as a distant supporting player on occasion and in many of those roles he was more talkative. At the least his face has the wear to make him sympathetic. Aside from Jessica Alba and a bit part from Lindsay Lohan, I don't have many complaints regarding the acting. In all cases, the highlights of Machete revolve around Cheech Marin. He makes a funny gun-wielding Padre, whereas most of the other actors lack comic timing.Machete is evidence of the dichotomy found in today's standards. On one end it is becoming painfully difficult to create a dramatic film that will please a crowd. On the other it seems possible to throw everything into a lowbrow throwback and achieve assured acceptance. I know that Rodriguez's reputation and ties to the untouchable Quentin Tarantino mean that anything with his name on it will be a hit with the target demographic: men. It won't even matter that Machete is a lesser cousin to Kill Bill. These are films that are beginning to establish, for lack of a better word, a new genre. This genre masquerades as low budget, sound effect lifting, testosterone-piquing throwbacks to a time cinema should have forgotten. The view forward shouldn't be tinted with the rose-colored glasses of nostalgia.",Machete
187,blackmambamark,"Less ""Grindhouse"", more political........and that is stupid.",6,3 September 2010,"Of all the movies i have EVER seen in a theater.....i can say with no doubts in my mind, that the most fun i have ever had, was with 2007's ""Grindhouse"". It is cinematic fun at it's purest. It reminded me why it is still fun to go to the movies. So when i heard that they were making one of the fake previews into an actual full length feature, i became just as excited as i did 3 years ago.Okay, just so i am clear with everyone......i am aware, and i appreciate the difference between ""Dumb/Funny"" and ""Dumb/Dumb"". And by that i mean it's funny when a movie is being dumb on purpose. I love it, and i laugh hysterically. A good example of this would be ""Planet Terror"" or ""Evil Dead"". But sometimes, the movie can get a little ahead of itself and not focus on making the story fun as well, which is a key element if you want your movie to be considered a fun ""B"" movie. ""Machete"" fell into the category of Dumb/Dumb.....which to me is a major disappointment.Dare i say that the movie lost focus of actually being a ""Grindhouse"" movie? You bet i do. It was clear that Robert Rodriguez was aiming this story towards the recent events that are taking place in Arizona. By making stupid inspirational lines of dialogue that were not entertaining, but boring as all hell. Needless to say, it felt like a movie that was trying to make a political statement, as opposed to a cheesy drive-in action flick. Don't get me wrong, the movie had a few elements that would pop out and make you laugh, just like you were hoping for........but they were not at every turn. In fact, you were almost begging for them. And it was due to this........first off, i love Danny Trejo, and i think him as a main character is awesome......but he came off as so dull and lifeless, it was almost hard to root for him. Secondly, the action was fun, but it came in very small doses. Which is really surprising to me, because Rodriguez is normally a huge fan of blowing up everything.....and i thought he was going to go over the top with this one because, well, it's suppose to be a 70's type action flick. Instead, it just came off as dull and half witted.Bottom Line......i gotta be honest, I'm a little upset with this one. I had really high expectations, and this movie fell way short of them. In my opinion, Rodriguez can't make sequels. To sum it up......he did the same thing to ""Grindhouse"", that he did to ""Desperado"". So if you actually liked the movie ""Once Upon a Time in Mexico"", then maybe you'll like this. But i gotta tell ya, it certainly isn't the Grindhouse spin-off i was hoping for.",Machete

Than let's try to make this the coolest movie we can possibly imagine!"", ""Rodriguez, work 12 hours a day with no lunch and make this amazing!"".It's very, very said. Because if things were toned down just a little and some more meaningful acting took place this would have been great. They should have taken notes from Anime, which is more dynamic yet similar to this.The main actor, Dany Trejo, performs amazingly here and if wasn't for him this would have sucked terribly. He doesn't act much but he almost looks like he could take Sigur from No Country for Old Men so it's awesome to watch him.The other actors sucked, sorry Michelle Rodriguez. Cheech was good though.Last. Nudity. I'm just morally against this. Sometimes it's o.k. like if it seems necessary.

Here we have a film that is not a whole lot more than watching badass Danny Trejo mowing down guys for 104 mins. The gore, however, is super over the top. Heads splatting, severed limbs, even a scene where someone lower intent is used as a grabble.Gore like that is so goofy you can't take this movie seriously, and that's no negative here. This is where this movies charm is found. It pays homage to exploitation b rate cinema while also maintaining a certain degree of charm and personality. All the additional performers are good. Rodriquez really makes this movie, putting things together that way he always does. Sure, there is a brief commentary on immigration and race relation, but it's more of a side dish, the main course is what Rodriquez does in the presentation. The result is nothing but watchable and entertaining as hell.",Machete
191,kuciak,Robert Rodriquez is still bombing Malta,5,20 January 2012,"Recently someone talking about the occupy movement commented that marches are good, but you can only march so long, you have to organize. That comment reminded me of this film, which has been quite a while since I've seen it. Danny Trejo and Jeff Fahey, Cheech Marin are really good in this film. However the same cannot be said for Robert De Niro (when has he really given a good performance recently or been in a good film0 Don Johnson, and Steven Segal.I will also say, this film starts out with a great bang, and their is a scene in a hospital which has to be seen to be believed, and perhaps the film should be seen for that great scene, which I think might be one of the 100 greatest scenes ever in a motion picture.the opening scene before the credits reminds me of something that the late Sam Fuller once, said, basically that the audience has to get a 'hard on', so you can hook the audience. This he does. The film continues with one big scene after the other, however, after a while I found myself wanting the film to end, as all it seemed to have was an opening act, and nothing more, over and over again.We learn at the beginning that Machete (Trejo) has suffered a tremendous loss, however Rodriguez never invests the film in this fact, it is totally forgotten. Also, he has missed a great opportunity with Steven Segal as the drug lord villain. Segal's entrance at the beginning is truly memorable, could say it almost rivals Henry Fonda's opening in Sergio Leones Once Upon a Time in The West. Once again, their is no investment made in his character, as he disappears through most of the movie only to come back again as more of a side show joke, which really isn't all that funny or entertaining.Robert Deniro and Don Johnson, respectively as a bigoted Tesas politician and Don Johnson, as a vicious killer of a group of vigilantes who kill illegal immigrants trying to cross the border are such cardboard cutups, though what happens to the Deniro character in the end is ironic. Yet these are truly cardboard characters, and nothing more, their acting isn't funny, scary or anything of interest. This is specially sad for Deniro. Robert Mitchum when working with Deniro on the 75 film The Last Tycoon, made fun of Deniro's acting seriousness. Perhaps if he were alive today and saw Deniro's performance here he would punch Deniro in the nose and say get back to the way you used to be. I realize that this film is supposed to be a go back to the 60's and early 70's of the so called 'Grind House' films, However I did not know that it was supposed to show what made some of these films so awful, something that the film 'Grindhouse' did not show.I liked Cheech Marin's role as a priest, though I think that some people who are Catholic's or Christians may find his role offensive, and it has nothing to do with his being a priest.Mr. Rodriguez has made a film here which could have been somewhat controversial, but he has really tried to take an easy way out and not offend anyone in the slightest, and with the poor cartoonish atmosphere of the film, he does not succeed. The film may want to be a comedy, but it isn't all that funny, and becomes rather tedious.I remember seeing his first feature El Mariachi, and how much promise I felt he held. It was a charming low budget film. Except for this two followup films with Antonio Banderras, 'Sin City', and the Planet Terror Episode of Grind House he really hasn't shown all that much.I guess it was back in the 90's when he collaborated on that Vampire film with actor George Clooney. I could help but think of the body of great work that Mr. Clooney has had since that film. It reminds me of a joke that my German Mother told me that went around during World War II. First I don't wish to offend Italian people, but it went like this. '1941, Germany invades Russia, Italy bombs Malta. 1956 Germany crosses the Misisipi, Italy bombs Malta.",Machete
192,a666333,"Another formulaic ripoff of the early 70s, hopefully tongue-in-cheek",3,7 September 2010,"I have to admit not really wanting to see this but with all the hype, it seemed like a good idea to see what the fuss was about and see if there was something interesting in it.Well, it flew by rather quickly and was quite forgettable. Cut and paste some early 70s exploitation films and more than a few scenes, poses, and gestures from Japanese and Hong Kong action films, move it to Texas with a ""plot"" centred around illegal immigration and drugs and you will quickly get Machete. It must have taken Rodriguez all of two minutes to sketch this one out.Tarantino has gone a similar route multiple times but where he attempts to update an old genre (that he admired in addition to wishing to rip-off), Rodriguez seems to deliberately try to cheaply recreate it in its worst original form. Thus, the music and sets and the visual and sound production seem deliberately dumbed down to make it seem like this was shot in 1973 (but alas, the gadzillion cell phones give it away). If that was the filmmakers' goal, they succeeded, but so what? Why should anyone be interested? By now, Rodriguez should be beyond student rehash projects shot in a junkyard.The acting, despite the name cast, is minimalist and deadpan and couldn't be much else as the dialogue is clips of cliques and the scenes edited into short comic like panels. What a waste! This film can only work as a tongue-in-cheek laugh, otherwise, it is terribly bad and yet not bad in a way that it emerges on the other side as classically bad. But do we need this comic book style, glazed over kind of violence and cheese to get there? A line from Edward G. Robinson in Soylent Green comes to mind, i.e. ""How did we come to this?"" In any case, I am still looking for that laugh/joke and as the film fades from memory, I don't think it will appear. Hopefully, Rodriguez will say something that fills in that blank, but I doubt he will.If you are looking for some kind of original message slipped in, you won't find it. There are some corrupt people who work all sides behind the scenes to manipulate the public and make dirty money. It is an old hat message, even if it is a message that can bear repeating. It's not much to go on. Finally, if you think that a couple of good fights or action scenes happened by chance, forget that too.

The topic here is ""illegal"" immigration (in case you weren't aware). The actual content and style is pretty much the same as Robert Rodriguez older movies like Desperado but if you are someone not pleased with illegal immigration then you'd probably feel deeply uncomfortable with the way that events that unfold in the movie.Machete is all brawn and in the later parts even starts referring to himself in the third person like ""Machete doesn't text"" but Trejo does exude the action hero charisma. Surprisingly the brains are all provided by the women; Luz who runs the network that help people cross the border and adapt, and Sartana who is in some sort of law enforcement in the American side. Senator McLaughlin played by Robert DeNiro is supposed to be a bad guy but something about the way the character is portrayed makes you feel sorry for him.

The fake trailer in 'Grindhouse' just screamed for more, and I was very happy with it being made into a full movie. First of all, I love Danny Trejo. In many movies I have seen with Trejo, he has such charisma with that beautiful ugly head of him. Then, Jessica Alba and Michelle Rodriguez are pure eye-candy. The movie started promising. The title sequence looked great, just like I expected, great artwork, great colors. Hurray, I thought, bring out the popcorn! The beginning of the movie was great. With over-the-top violence combined with typical Rodriguez humor, it was pretty much what I hoped for. Then, somehow, it went horribly wrong. It went from great and promising to simply boring. That Rodriguez tried to put a political message in it, OK. But don't chew it out for me, and definitely do not spend most of the movie chewing it out! Where was the action? I wanted to see Trejo using his machete, chicks with guns, flying heads. Instead, what I got was a boring storyline without anything to balance that out. The humor was degraded to an almost Dukes of Hazard feel, and though the incidental machete-through-head turned a vague smile on my face, my popcorn got old. Throughout the movie, I had some hopes for the end. But even the end was disappointing. I'm really very sorry to say so mister Rodriguez, but Machete feels much like a missed chance. There were no good dialogs, hardly any good action (apart from the opening scenes), and not even Trejo could do something good about it. Update: Let me add something here for all those who keep on defending this movie by saying it is such a brilliant satire on the b-movie genre. Sure it is a satire, well, it is meant to be like that. But being a satire, it should be over the top, making fun of it, poking around with it. It shouldn't just copy bad and boring movies, it should rise above that by totally exploiting it, in the same way a painter paints a caricature. You see, when a painter makes your portrait to a caricature, he blows everything out of proportion. Instead of painting your face as boring as it is, he exaggerates. In most Rodriguez's previous movies, yes, he did manage to do a fine job in satire. But in my opinion, he totally failed to do so in Machete. For me, it's not enough to make a bad movie and then to say that 'it is so bad because it is a satire'. A good satire needs more than that. It's no excuse. If you use this as an excuse, then every moron can make a bad movie, which doesn't stand out in any way, and say it is a satire. Because this one is made by Rodriguez, whose movies I have always watched with much pleasure, doesn't have to make me applaud it. My points: 5 out of ten. Max.",Machete

Why ""Machete"" though? Where did it come from?

A grindhouse, according to Merriam-Webster.com, is ""an often shabby movie theater having continuous showings especially of pornographic or violent films."" The Rodriguez/ Tarantino collaboration weighed more on the violent side. Rodriguez had his film, ""Planet Terror,"" at the beginning and Tarantino had his film, ""Death Proof,"" at the end.

""Machete"" played by Danny Trejo (""Heat,"" ""Spy Kids,"" ""Predators,"" you will know his face when you see it) plays the title character who starts the film as a Federale in Mexico that is double-crossed by his agency and loses his family to a ruthless Mexican overlord, Torrez (played by Steven Segal, remember him?). Three years later Machete is in Texas looking for day work while the immigration wars are heating up among Texans, mainly Robert De Niro and Don Johnson (remember him?) and the rest of the illegal Mexican population. Machete is hired by Booth (played by Jeff Fahey, does that name ring a bell?) to assassinate Sen. McLaughlin (De Niro). After another double cross, Machete is on the run. But, he is in luck; there is an underground Mexican network to help him out of almost any jam where he finds himself. Have you ever heard that coincidence doesn't work in fiction? It's a shortcut through the thinking process. That rule doesn't apply when it comes to campy, B-movies. Out of all the illegal immigrants and high power officials in Texas it just so happen that everyone is connected. No worries though, the story line isn't as important as the bad acting which will stick in your head if you think about it too much. Heck, even Lindsay Lohan (I won't bother to ask if you remember her) has a part in this mêlée. And, she doesn't even have to act, she only has to play her own drug-addicted starlet self and it still comes off as bad acting. Furthermore, the bad acting isn't even comparable to the gore and violence. The folks at Looney Tunes couldn't have come up with better cartoonish violent acts. The violence in ""Machete"" does add in the excessive blood and guts factor (and when I write guts I really mean GUTS, you will see actual guts).The cartoonish violence doesn't take away from the focus of the racial stereotyping. The writers (Robert Rodriguez helped pen the screenplay along with Alvaro Rodriguez) left no stone unturned when thinking of any Mexican cultural stereotypical reference. Illegal Mexican workers - check. Mexicans with lots of tattoos and wrap-around sunglasses - got 'em. Mexicans with low riders and the hydraulics to boot - wouldn't forget those. Mexicans in a Catholic Church - why, of course, aren't all Mexicans Catholic? Mexicans working a taco stand - yep, all Mexicans eat tacos. The entire film was overrun with so many outrageously artificial scenarios that the audience was given no other choice but to accept this as an action/ satire film. Should you see this movie? Only if you know what you are getting yourself into. If you are politically correct, don't have a sense of humor, don't like violence of any kind, haven't seen or didn't like ""Planet Terror"" then stay away, go see ""Eat Pray Love"" one more time. For the rest of us, take a little trip and see it.",Machete
200,redroominparis,Boggles the mind,4,5 April 2019,"You'd think the producers would give Trejo some acting lessons. I mean, Evans and Jackman have acting chops but had to prepare physically for their roles. De Niro must have been satisfying some kind of studio obligation or he's old and doesn't give a f%!k.

However if that is what interests you I suggest you get the clips.

203,LawnBoy-4,"WHY did you kill off the ""Grindhouse"" effect after the opening titles?!?",5,26 April 2014,"I had such high hopes for this film. A Robert Rodriguez directed film starring Danny Trejo and born out of the hilarious (and thematically consistent) collection of Grindhouse trailers - what's not to like? Well, after the opening titles, quite a bit, unfortunately.The film begins with our hero, Machete, in a scratchy-film, sepia toned, exploitation-riddled shootout during which Machete watches his wife get beheaded and learns of his kid's death, all at the hands of super-cheesy Steven Segal. Blood and exploitation abound! The opening titles continue with the ""Grindhouse"" theme, featuring scratchy film quality, gritty music and low- budget still photos and titles for the cast. This is going to be GREAT, I thought, wistfully longing for that Grindhouse feel that Rodriguez (and, to a lesser degree, Tarantino) had captured only a few years prior.The disappointment begins once the titles finish.Suddenly (and inexplicably), the scratchy film and sepia tones are gone and the viewer is left with a remaining hour and a half of obviously tongue-in-cheek schlock that no longer possesses the benefit of the true Grindhouse effect.Even when Tarantino's ""Death Proof"" went off the rails by ditching the effect to become little more than a self-indulgent homage to ""Vanishing Point"", ""Two-Lane Blacktop"" and ""Faster, Pussycat! Kill Kill!"", it was still....ya know....entertaining. While ""Machete"" isn't completely devoid of value, the choice to abandon the Grindhouse effect after the first ten minutes essentially and effectively betrayed the whole point of making the film in the first place! This was SUPPOSED to be a low-budget flick you would have seen at a drive-in, complete with poor film quality, washed out colors and missing frames. Instead, it's just a weak, contrived sleepwalk through genre filmmaking that does a complete injustice to the genres (south of the border films, late night Grindhouse fare and general B-movie schlock) it claims to honor.Pass on this one and just go back and watch the trailer instead.",Machete
204,stallone-9,Machete delivers,8,3 September 2010,"So right to the point Machete was *beep* awesome and Rodriguez redeemed himself after producing the $hitty Predators film.Danny Trejo is very charismatic and 100% cool as hell and hopefully will be the main star of many upcoming flicks(at the beginning of the end credits the narrator says Machete will return in Machete KILLS and Machete KILLS AGAIN!!!:)All the cast delivered except for Lohan(she was the major weak link in the film)my personal favorites were Trejo of course and Fahey as the sadistic,vile and a total douche bag Benz(who's also sexually attracted to his daughter).Cheech Marin s Padre was one of the main attractions with his absolutely kick ass supporting role and dies spectacularly as always(being crucified and getting nailed with pins by Fahey).Michelle Rodriguez and Jessica Alba were both 100% sexy and delivered whatever acting skills they got however I definitely think Michelle was the better one in this film both in terms of sex appeal and character.Seagal as Torrez had very little screen time but did good(chopping Machete wife's head in the beginning was badass)and had a hilariously bad Spanish accent.The final Seagal/Trejo fight was short but well choreographed and ends up in a hilarious way which I won't spoil cause you gotta see if for yourselves :).De Niro was always solid in his portrayal as a corrupt senator who's selfish and self loving(De Niro also has a hilarious accent in this).Don Jonson had very little screen time but he succeeded in being a total ass hole who you just can't wait to die(too bad his death was off screen)The action scenes were excellent and bloody make no mistake Machete delivered on the violence(guts get ripped out,heads are chopped aplenty,faces are penetrated with sharp objects (even a high heel to the eye ball) yeah just gotta love the Rodriguez violence.There was a lot of humor such as the ""Machete don't text "" line by Trejo,a girl pulling a self phone out of her pussy in the beginning(gotta love the sound it makes),Machete making out with Benz's wife and daughter...The film never takes itself seriously and that works hugely in its favor but we all knew that right after the first fake trailer right?On the downside there is Lindzey Lohan and he absolutely irritating April character which I so wanted to die but it didn't happen instead the girl dressed as a nun shoots a dozen men at the end like a pro out of nowhere seeking revenge after the senator for killing her dad.The entire scene was badly pulled off and just didn't work don't know why Rodriguez cast her at all?And the other flaw is that the director of Predators Nimrod Antal appears not once but twice and Machete doesn't kill him?!They guy at least deserves a film death:( but aside from that the film is ridiculously entertaining and totally badass hope Machete KILLS arrives soon a 9/10 from me.",Machete
205,kastellos,Typical Rod garbage,1,7 November 2011,"7.0! Are you kidding me? I don't understand the fascination people have with Rodriguez and Tarantino. Both have made far too many junk films filled with extreme violence, unbelievable and stupid story lines (if you can discover the storyline between all the blood spattering), soft porn nudity, over the top villains and bad acting with worse direction.This film, almost as bad as Grindhouse/Planet Terror, is simply worthless. Trejo is stiff, Alba is even more wooden, Fahey is over the top, Seagal is the worst I've ever seen him. Michelle Rodriguez gave the only passable performance - but just barely.The plot, typical of Rodriguez, is nonsense. A killing machine Mexican Federale escapes being killed by(of course) a brutal beast Mexican drug lord who used a Japanese sword to decapitate the Federale's wife. The Federale lies low as a day worker in Texas for 3 years, where a crooked state politician and militia leader shoot illegals as if they were hunting deer. Come on - this is worse than comic books (Oh! excuse me, I forgot pop culture has upgraded comic books to ""Graphic Novels"" by making them misogynist, soft porn like, more violent and spattering gallons of blood.).I know, I know, Crucifixes in urine and Rodriguez movies are ""art."" Well, for me, it is art I can do without. How I long for Elias Kazan!",Machete
206,Mrswing,What's Mexican slang for crap??,1,18 September 2010,"Robert Rodriguez strikes (out) again. Stringing together some cruel moments of gore with lame comedy, a few bare breasts (how people can rave about the copious nudity in this movie when there's hardly anything on show is beside me), heavy-handed political satire which makes his sincere message come across as racist stupidity and some of the least exciting action scenes ever, Machete is a complete failure. Acting performances are weak across the board, and Danny Trejo is a frightening figure, yet he doesn't cut it (ooh, look, I made a pun) as an interesting lead character. He doesn't have the charisma to transcend the extreme simplicity of the character. And while I know he could crush me with his bare hands, he certainly doesn't convince when going up against villainous henchmen half his age. The finale is the worst part of the film. The heroic Mexicans attack the racist American vigilantes, and much slaughter ensues, but without any tension at all, with extremely weak choreography and telegraphed 'cool' moments referencing 'classic' exploitation characters which are largely embarrassing. Nothing is quite as embarrassing as the final battle between Trejo and Steven Seagal, though. No choreography to speak of, shot and edited in the least effective way (I've seen better fights in TV-series), and with an utterly lame ending, it has absolutely no redeeming features. Except that it's short (barely one minute of screen time). Maybe one day Rodriguez will accept the fact that he can't write or tell stories, and start working from scripts by other people who can. Until that day, we'll be stuck with crap like Machete, however.",Machete
207,kdavidbushnell,Not for a REAL Movie goer,1,6 September 2010,"This movie was so bad! Rodriguez is such a terrible director. He can't make a movie with out stupid grainy effects that just annoy the hel* out of the viewer (it gets so old, especially when its in all of his terrible films). The action is always, always over the top in his films, which was alright in a movie like Sin City, but COME ON, grow up as a director! The over the top action isn't even cool or exciting anymore its so dumb. The dialogue makes me want to cringe! All of these terrible Rodriguez films have no linear or good dialogue! It's constant cliché', cheesy, over the top, trying to hard to sound Bad a** or tough ONE LINERs! that's all this movie consisted of two besides an awful story that is a mess because it tries to be political and serious with awful directing techniques and grossly laughable ONE Liners! Mindless plot to have MORE over the top BS from this BS director and even the actors can't get it write because it's so poorly written, or possibly because the only good actor in the whole movie is Deniro.This is exactly why 90% of the top 250 on IMDb are just a joke. Because most people don't really appreciate film or the art of it and think ""wow that, mess genre'd terribly written, movie with over the top action and nudity is so cool man- its the best!"" (when its been done a thousand and two times and its just laughable now) Don't waste your time on this film! Unless you are the type of person who is a mindless movie goer.

Making movies that intentionally try to look like grade B drive in movies has been done.Loading up a movie with stars and guest stars has been done as well, and this movie has plenty of that - it was not until the credits I realized an actor I did not recognize was Don Johnson. There's plenty of well known faces here.I think of this movie as a synthesis of a lot of movie ideas. Somehow, it works. I got vibes of blaxpoitation films at times (the sex scenes,) a kind of pulp fiction vibe, a general B movie vibe, a modern action movie vibe, along with hint (maybe) of real political commentary (about immigrants.) It's quite violent. I don't care much for violent movies, but at times the violence is SO over the top I just could not take it seriously. Nor did I think I was supposed to.If you dislike violence, don't see this. If you dislike gratuitous nudity, don't see this. If you dislike camp, don't see this. On the other hand, if you like a quirky, campy, violent movie, with a little T&A and a whole lot of attitude, this is the movie to see.I was surprised to find I totally loved it, and almost wanted to give it a 10 out of 10, but that would have implied perfect execution of their concept, and I felt maybe a few things could have been better done - and it's not my new favorite movie, so that also makes it 9 / 10.",Machete

That scene wasn't comedy, nor horror. It was just plain stupid. Wait a minute, now I know how they write the movie scripts for this fecal jars!

211,hendry-robert,"Great movie, shame about the racist film maker",2,24 September 2010,"Let us imagine for a moment a movie that portrayed Arabs or Africans, or Chinese as racist maniacs, totally corrupt, greedy to their cores, void of any morality, capable of gunning down a pregnant mother and an accompanying child, incestuous tendencies etc. A race that is just pure evil to its very core that it ought to be stamped out, and hey that's all right jack because its just a race of Arabs, Africans, or Chinese. Do you think such a movie could be made and sent out on worldwide release? Of course not, there would be world wide cries of fowl, demonstrations, and without any doubt widespread violence.Yet, this is exactly how Robert Rodriguez has portrayed white people, specifically white American males, and even more specifically white Texan males. This is not a parody,this is not artists vision, this is pure hate speech dressed up in a stylish, well made good VS bad B style movie which from that perspective at least is excellent.Not a single Mexican in this movie is bad, only the white man is. The white American women are portrayed as good which was utterly predictable. I wont go in to any psycho babble as to why many liberals and people like Rodriguez have this train of thought, but it seems to me the recurring theme in the liberal mind of White Man Is Evil - White Women good, just a shame about their men. I believe it speaks volumes how they think and perceive white men. Do they feel threatened by the white races achievements over the centuries? I don't know to be honest, but something bothers them deeply about us white men, they just never come out and say it.I really mean it when I say this is the most racist movie I have ever seen in my life. Rodriguez does neither white Americans or Mexicans any favours here, that's for sure. What he is doing is inciting racial hatred and he knows it.",Machete
212,Forgotten_Conscience_Productions,Machete Review: Would you like a Machete?,4,6 June 2013,"Film can be a ridiculous medium. There are essentially no limits to what you can do with it if you have the vision and the determination to accomplish it, particularly in today's world of CGI and visual effects that can be done quickly and cheaply if you know what you're doing. It's kind of mind boggling the things that you can do. Essentially you're only limited by your imagination. So then of course the only question becomes, how good is your imagination? Sometimes what you envision doesn't hold up when you put it into practise. I've seen that happen more than a few times. A film can also exceed the vision originally thought of, whether it's by the filmmakers themselves or the audience's expectations of those films.Then you have those films that you're not entirely sure how to feel about them. The films that you know have a good reputation and a loyal fan base but you never really got around to seeing. I have a number of such films on a rather long metaphorical list, some of which I have actually checked out after starting my blog. One of those films is Machete and I recently got a chance to see it thanks to my ongoing quest for content I can provide to my blog. It feels really good to get that kind of stuff off my ""to do"" list.Perhaps to begin, I think it's worth saying that I am a fan of Quentin Tarantino's work. Reservoir Dogs, Kill Bill Volume 1 and 2, as well as Inglorious Basterds are high up there on the list of films I really admire as both an avid film fan and a writer/filmmaker myself. I wouldn't count myself as one of his biggest fans though. While I enjoy his films I sometimes have trouble dealing with the gratuitous nature of the violence in his work. I'm not opposed to violence in film. I'm not even necessarily opposed to excessive violence in films as long as it serves the story. What often bothers me is when the violence is a little too over the top for it to serve the story. Suspension of disbelief is a necessary part of watching a movie, but unrealistic violence, even the kind that is intentionally created within the world of the story, can be just as damaging to my ability to believe something as a character or an actor acting unnaturally in a given situation.Robert Rodriguez is someone I am less familiar with as a storyteller, although he did make two films that I very much enjoyed, namely Sin City and The Faculty. Watching Machete however, I think it often came off like a Tarantino film directed by another director, and that's not always a good thing. This is not to say that Machete isn't a well done film. By all accounts the story is relatively solid, the acting was decent and the political angle is pretty much right up my alley. Where I think the film loses me though is that it's just not my kind of film. Grindhouse films aren't something I really ever got into at any point and Machete was an off-shoot of the whole Planet Terror/Death Proof double bill. Not every great film from the past catches my fancy. About a year or so back I managed to catch Scarface for the first time and I got kind of bored watching it.By no means was I bored watching Machete, however it feels like they made their point early on in the film and then just kept going, and going, and going. The only thing that kept it going is the increasing need for violence to solve people's problems. That and beautiful women going around doing stuff. As a guy, that's worth watching, but as a storyteller it just doesn't keep me going. So Would you like a Machete? Because I am thinking I might just pass on the sequels.To check out more of my reviews, go here: http://andrew-heard.blogspot.ca/",Machete

214,Greywolf907,Every Now And Again.......,2,24 September 2010,"...a film comes along that raises questions that just need addressing and demand answers. Machete is one such film. With a plot loosely, and I use that word guardedly, based around the steady influx of illegal immigration oozing into Texas from Mexico and their impact on the States economy you would perhaps be forgiven for thinking that the questions raised would demand some serious chin stroking about the relative merits of economic migrants. However, none of those questions even poke their metaphoric head above the parapet and instead we need to ask 'why did a player like Robert De Niro end up in this garbage?' 'Why was it made?''Who watches and rates this sort of stuff so highly' and finally a big fat 'WHY?'Steven Segal, who has not made a decent movie since 'Nico' and has since appeared in the same dreadfully dreary film countless times as an 'ex cook/soldier/sailor who suddenly finds himself in the middle of a terrorist action and single handedly hams his way through until the mind numbingly dull finale....manages to stumble his now portly self through this claptrap while managing to keep his perfectly black hairpiece in place (grow old gracefully Steve)adding nothing to the 'plot' whatsoever.The dialogue throughout is appallingly bad and seems to have been written by a retarded schoolboy and his mates who think that 'grown ups' talk like that....it's dire...all of it.The action sequences consist of some old bloke with a bad mullet and a big moustache hacking various rubber appendages off of extras in poorly choreographed fight scenes that probably appeal to that same group of schoolboys that penned the script, as an 'action hero' the main character can't run, can't act and certainly in real life would not be bedded by hot women within 2 minutes of meeting them.Don 'Miami Vice' Johnson, remember him? also appears as some grossly caricatured comedy baddie with a hat to chew up the scenery when others give him the chance to....all in all...this is a pathetic film.Is it a comedy? did not make me laugh....is it a spoof?...did not make me laugh...is it terrible? you bet.If you are an 11 year old shut in with a bizarre view of what baddies are then you will be right at home here, if not, give it a miss unless you really want to annoy yourself silly.",Machete

We had beer, smoke, snacks, and a tub of the most buttery popcorn you've ever tasted! With the hilarious antics on the screen, it was truly a great time.

Much to my satisfaction, ""The Crazy Babysitter Twins"" (Electra Avellan and Elise Avellan) from ""Planet Terror"" also had roles. If you aren't aware of them, they are easily two of the hottest girls on the planet!...And they shoot machine guns while wearing sexy nurse outfits!

I would love to spill the scene of Cheech and Lindsay Lohan, which had me laughing for about 15 minutes alone! Steven Seagal was also terrific - he had a spectacular one-liner that you shouldn't miss. Robert DeNiro was very funny as well. Jeff Fahey was super cool. And you can't say enough about the 66-year-old Danny Trejo...I'd be happy to look anywhere close to him at 36! Jessica Alba and Michelle Rodriguez helped carry the story, they were tremendous.

Given The fact the movie was literally born out from a trailer the movie is amazingly entertaining. Danny Trejo as machete did a great job. Even though he is 66 year old he was surprisingly was able to pull of many physically demanding task, as machetes toughest Rival Steven Seagal did a good job, even though it was noticeable that age caught up to Steven Seagal he kept up with the rest of the crew. Robert DeNiro is as always good at what he does. Michelle Rodriguez as Luz also did a fine job at times she looked hotter than anyone else in the movie and speaking of hot Jessica Alba Looks very hot herself. Lindsay Lohan actually was not irritating for once and actually was entertaining to watch. But there are also downsides to the movie, The Blood and Gore scenes should have been better. Many Blood and Gore scenes were confused with a weird effect which the technical team is to blame for, Also i couldn't help but notice that somethings are a Little too Illogical Even for a Mexploitation movie. In the first action scene Machetes Partner dies in the car, which machete was driving. i mean normally people target those who are Driving first which was weird. There are many Illogical scenes like that but to be honest it wont really bother anyone. So at the end of the day MACHETE is what people will expect maybe more. Even though its not as Great as Grindhouse or Desperado but its surely worth a watch",Machete
219,TVGuy3,Machete Delivers,7,4 September 2010,"Hey guys, this is TVGuy3, I'll be reviewing new movies that come out every week. I went to Machete with low expectations and I was pleasantly surprised. The acting and direction definitely could have been better, but that's not what matters in this movie. You watch Machete to see people get slaughtered in creative, gruesome ways. Like an earlier review said, this movie is corny violent cheap and AWESOME.Great visuals save this movie from being an unneeded disaster by keeping you involved. Every 5 seconds there is a gory, yet very cool death. If you have a strong stomach, go see it. If not, you should just stay home, but you're definitely missing out on something great. It won't get any Oscar nods, but if there was a most entertaining category, it would give Piranha 3D a run for its money.",Machete
220,andre-bed,"Action, thriller, comedy or all of them ?",2,23 September 2010,"There is some humour in the movie. It kind of saves it. All of the blood and violence seems to be meaningless. The plot does not say how some things happened. A great deal is left to our own imagination. The soundtrack is good, I enjoyed the performance of the actors ( except Steven Seagal ). I would say this is a movie for teenagers. But not for all of them. One cannot trace a parallel with real life, because most of the things that take place in this movie are way too improbable to happen. Kind of ""Kill Bill"" style if you know what I mean. However I must say ""Kill Bill"" finds bits of resemblance with real life, in some moments, whereas ""machete"" is so disconnected with reality that you end up being taken to ""another reality"". There is only the issue of illegal immigration in the movie and the ""death squads"" that could be real. The rest is just a mind-trip.",Machete
221,cinemaofdreams,Skip The Film and Watch The Trailer,4,4 September 2010,"What a complete letdown. A film with a few good, albeit sick, laughs. Some lesser 70s exploitation films out there are far more entertaining than this piece of professional amateurism. One problem is that Rodriguez is trying to make a statement about political/human rights issues in 2010 and in doing so seems to forget that he is making a quasi-1970s exploitation movie. His political statement is not lost on me and I appreciate his political and social lampooning but it detracts from the film. All the fun of Planet Terror is simply not here. It takes good acting to deliver a mockingly bad performance, and what is often on screen is simply actors going through the motions rather than the tongue-in-cheek, over-the-top work needed to deliver the expected grindhouse sleaze.",Machete
222,arginnon,A fan's dream,6,4 May 2012,"I am a huge fan and admirer of Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino. I love their films, they are artistic, fun and have a special kind of feeling that lingers around them. I wanted to see Machete in theaters, but didn't have the time for. So I got it on DVD and I already watched it twice.It is a very good film, if you like Rodriguez's style and liked the original fake trailer. The film doesn't disappoint, gives you everything it promises. Danny Trejo is a bad-ass, Michelle Rodriguez also, Cheech Marin, Don Johnson and Jeff Fahay were great, Tom Savini was funny and the appearances of Daryl Sabara, Electra and Elise Avellan, Felix Sabates and Tommy Nix were great surprises after Spy Kids and Planet Terror. One of the many things I like about Robert Rodriguez is that he works with the same actors.On the other hand I felt that Robert DeNiro and Steven Seagal were very out of place in this movie and Jessica Alba was kind of annoying. Lindsey Lohan was surprisingly good and the cameo of Antal Nimród was a great touch for a Hungarian like me.The story you might already now, Machete is hired to kill a senator, but he is double crossed, so he kills everybody and sleeps with every woman.The only thing I missed from this film was the touch of Tarantino. It would've been awesome if he co-directed or at least got a cameo like Antal Nimród.I liked Machete very much, it was great fun.",Machete
223,Roadwarrior85846,Machete ends the summer blockbusters with a BANG!,10,5 September 2010,"Hands down, Machete is one exciting ride! Robert Rodriguez fans won't be disappointed. The acting was great, setting the mood of the film. The effects and action scenes were over-the-top awesome! To be honest, this film felt that this has more testosterone than recent action movie, The Expendables, which I believe nobody have seen that coming!Danny Trejo plays Machete. Worked as a fed in Mexico few years ago. But in the present time, he's an illegal alien tryng to make a living in Texas doing several jobs here and there. Until one day, a millionaire name Booth (Jeff Fahey) gives him a reward of $150,000 to assassinate the Senator of Texas (Robert De Niro). When Machete had the chance to take Senator McLaughlin down, he had been double-crossed. Thats when things get wild!In conclusion, it is one very entertaining film. Sure, there are a few dull/cheesy scenes like Alba's ""Border crossed us!"" quote and Lindsay Lohan playing as herself but easily forgiven because the majority of this flick is constant action and comedy! Machete is a must-see film to conclude the summer blockbusters of 2010.",Machete
224,VideoGameHollywood,"Soooo stupid, Robert Rodriguez has the mind of a 10-year-old.",1,11 September 2010,"Here's the deal. Robert Rodriguez is no brilliant director that the world thinks he is. After watching ALL of his films you can tell that this guy has the mind-set of a 10-year-old. He's a complete tool, wearing tight v-neck shirts and probably gets off to pictures of himself. Machete was just what you think it is. A Mexican Rambo who is fighting for immigration rights. But wait this movie is unique because its campy and exploitative.... NO, its corny, thats it, Robert Rodriguez is corny. He has no originality, just the mind of a immature juvenile who loves himself. The movie is a typical action movie with some fun blood effects and boobs, but nothing more. Watch Desperado for Danny Trejo acting in a better character, but lets be honest, even that movie becomes unwatchable after 2/3 the way through. It's just bad filmmaking and people like him will continue to make garbage for the rest of their lives.Rating = D- ...and i'm being generousVideoGameHollywood.com",Machete
225,rocky_lifter69,A guilty pleasure that is actually quite good,9,19 November 2010,"It's needless to say that this is an extremely polarizing type of movie. A throwback to the old grindhouse exploitation days, Machete was never intended to set the world on fire or rake in Oscars. Rather it was crafted to be over the top and fun and on both of these fronts it succeeds impressively.Danny Trejo stars as Machete, a former government agent whose wife was murdered in front of him by a drug lord (Steven Seagal). Several years later, after becoming a street worker, he is unwittingly recruited to assassinate a corrupt politician (Robert DeNiro) with big plans for getting illegal immigrants out of the U.S. When it turns out the assassination attempt was actually a setup to boost the popularity of the senator, Machete finds himself with the opportunity to get revenge for his wife. Helping along the way are a taco vendor/underground freedom fighter (Michelle Rodriguez), a government agent (Jessica Alba) and his shotgun wielding priest brother (Cheech Marin).The movie epitomizes over the top. At one point Machete repels out of a window using the intestines of a still living enemy for rope. There is plenty of ridiculous action to be had, along with fun small roles for Lindsay Lohan (playing a coked out internet porn star, imagine that) and Don Johnson. The rest of the cast appears to be having a blast, except for Danny Trejo, who is too busy playing the ultimate bad ass. There's plenty of tongue in cheek moments with both the dialogue and music to give a few good laughs along the way. If approached with the right mindset, Machete is a couple hours worth of over the top violence and fun that you won't feel guilty for enjoying.",Machete
226,Thomasamills,Rodriguez At His Blistering Best,6,12 April 2011,"Roberet Rodriguez finally lets Danny Trejo be the leading man in this over the the top splat fest after working with him numerous times before. Well, the wait to see Trejo as a ledaing man is finally over. Like many other Rodriguez fans I thought that the fake trailer for Machete which was shown at the start of Planet terror, was fantastic and looked like it should be a Rodriguez film. Not just a fake trailer. Even though I really enjoyed Planet terror (infact I prefer it to Deathproof, which is saying something as I am a die hard Tarantino fan) I could not get the Machete trailer out of my head after the film. The news that the fake trailer would become a full length feature film was like my prayers being answered.Danny Trejo is Mechete. One of the most memorable characters from a Rodriguez film since Clooney and Tarntino's Gecko brothers back in 19996 in From Dusk Til Dawn. There is no surprise that Tom Savini makes an appearance, although I was surprised how under used he was. Robert De Nero unfortunately doesn't bring much to the table and neither dies Steven Seagal or Jessica Alba. However I was impressed by Michelle Rodriguez and the brief moments spent on screen by Lindsey Lohan were amusing.I personally would have liked to see a Tarantino cameo, but beggars can't be choosers.The film is solid on story either, however it has enough of a plot to keep the film going just over 90 minutes. The reason why I enjoyed the film so much though isn't because of the plot or performances. It's watching Rodriguez give the audience a blast through his films. The violence is as gory as it can be, whilst also being aware its all tongue and cheek. The action is as extravagant as you can imagine with countless amounts of blades, bullets and babes.Although it's hardly a memorable action film, its great while it's there. It's pure Rodriguez through and through and I am sure fans of his other films will not be disappointed.",Machete
227,Sam_Youno,How in Hell Did They Get De Niro for This Pile of Crap?,3,5 December 2014,"I love a good bloodfest as much as anyone, and in films where stage blood accounts for 50% of the production budget, I'm not really particular about plots. (Actually, the plot here is halfway decent.) So far, so good. But the script is boring, clichéd and predictable, and the acting---the main reason for my 3 rating---is just plain dreadful. Danny Trejo is okay, because he doesn't have more than three or four sentences in the whole film, and it's fun to see an action hero who's shorter than I am. But every time one of the other characters opened his or her mouth, I cringed, hoping that he or she would be immediately decapitated---a wish that was fulfilled surprisingly often.And then there's Robert De Niro, playing a scheming, anti-immigration Senator with a Texas accent as deep as the Rio Grande. Oh, Robert, Robert, Robert: Did you really need the money that much? In any event, De Niro is fine, as always, and almost makes ""Machete"" watchable. Almost. 3 out of 10.",Machete
228,stevechams,The usual,4,7 February 2011,"The usual: White people are bad and the Mexicans never do anything wrong.... sucked. Chicks are hot but the acting was bad except for Michelle Rodriguez. The action is what you would expect from the director; way over the top, body count was high (+1 star), the blood splatter was nice, but very predictable. Danny Trejo is one ugly bass ass dude. Steven Seagal, Don Johnson and Deniro made the movie watchable. Lohan didn't act, she just relived her last weekend. I gave it a four/ten just because I watched it until the end. I was able to watch it cause I was doing laundry. The ending left it open for sequels, god I hope not.",Machete
229,BigBabe0,"Robert Rodriguez is God, or at the very least, St. Michael the Archangel....",10,8 September 2010,"Sorry Jimmy Breslin for paraphrasing that line from ""The Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight,"" but I wanted it pretty clear out the gate where I stand. This is quite possibly the coolest flick I've ever seen---naw, screw that, it IS the coolest. For those of you who haven't seen ""Grindhouse""---and if you haven't, shame on you, and you should probably stop reading this---this is based on one of the ""fake trailers"" conjuring up those great trashy movies that those of us who were around in the 1970's and 1980's remember so lovingly. Not only does ""Machete"" feature the gloriously outrageous and stylized violence that's a Rodriguez trademark (wait 'til you see the gruesomely inventive use of some poor sap's intestines in one scene), but he seizes a hot-button topic in the news (i.e. illegal immigration) and makes some telling social points without ever getting remotely preachy with it. Those ""Minutemen"" types (as embodied by Don Johnson in a beautifully modulated performance; after Kurt Russell, I think Johnson's the most under-rated actor in America) are real, folks. They really are on the border with guns, making their own ""law"" and risking an international incident every day. There really are self-serving politicians (as embodied by Robert De Niro, who seems to have the most fun with a role in years) who promulgate hysteria about ""illegal aliens"" ---well hell, look at that law in Arizona. There really are people who want to build a wall between us and Mexico--what are we, East Berlin now? ---and in a brilliant touch, Rodriguez turns this into a scheme by dope dealers to control the price. (The ""war on drugs"" would be really easy to ""win""--just treat every substance the way we do tobacco and alcohol.) Those Mexican immigrants whom we scorn really do grease the wheels of this economy and are brutally exploited by companies who use some of their blood money to buy off the politicians. I don't know if there really is an underground ""Network"" (as embodied by Michelle Rodriguez, about whom what can I say--well I can say this, I stopped watching ""Lost"" when she got killed off; she's as hot as ever, even--or especially--with an eye patch) but that would be great. Viva la raza! ---and I'm not even Hispanic, but I'm also descended from immigrants, as are all Americans; even the Indians supposedly came here from somewhere else...I want to start a new paragraph to focus on the acting; like his ""brother"" Quentin Tarantino, Robert Rodriguez manages to elicit from most of his actors the best performance that person has given (or probably will give). Danny Trejo in the title role is a kind of Latin Robert Mitchum, all he needs to do to own the screen is stand there, he's magnificent. (He stole ""The Devil's Rejects,"" among many other titles.) Jessica Alba sheds her pouty ""precious"" persona and shows some real steel as the immigration agent who can't quite cut her roots; just the scene alone with her air-boxing to a video game is worth having her. Cheech Marin reminds us he can actually act. Jeff Fahey brings a complex and contradictory character to sleazy life. Lindsay Lohan gives what I would call her first ""adult"" performance. Tom Savini is always a blast (I just wish he'd get bigger parts). My only slight quibble: Steven Seagal more or less ""phones in"" his role as the drug kingpin (imagine what Powers Boothe would have done with this); maybe Seagal as a screen persona just doesn't have the ""juice"" I was craving. If the actor's ""too cool for school,"" then the movie tends not to be. But never mind: by all means treat yourself to this gut-bucket visceral blast of genuine show-don't-tell cinema, and then see it again, as I plan to. One more point about Rodriguez: even his ""kid movies"" don't completely suck, and ordinarily the presence of kids in a film are about as welcome to me as root-canal surgery (which I've had)....Fans of Mr. R. will enjoy the references to his earlier work, such as ""Desperado,"" both with the vest with throwing knives (worn by the character that Danny Trejo played in that one) and in the scene where Mr. Trejo has to react to bad guys looming just outside while he's in bed with someone. Also fun are the cultural references such as the Hispanic ""Exactamundo"" network, a variation on ""Telemundo"" which even some of us gringos watch. (Talk about ""violence""; Telemundo even had the gory sequel to ""El Cartel"" in the 7 p.m. time slot.) I'll admit that I was a bit puzzled by the scene where Mr. Trejo is in bed with Ms. Rodriguez and she cracks open an egg and puts it on the floor under the bed. Maybe the smell is a kind of aphrodisiac? Or maybe it's meant to invoke scenes like the one in Bunuel's ""El Bruto"" where the camera lingers on some meat cooking during a sex scene...",Machete
230,matthewmercy,A great guy with his chopper...,2,8 October 2010,"Inspired by the spoof trailer included in both the US and UK releases of the two Grindhouse movies, Robert Rodriguez' Machete is a stupid, misconceived excuse for a film that doesn't raise half the laughs the original trailer did and tries its audience's patience to breaking point. I refuse to give Rodriguez the benefit of the doubt by assuming that Machete is 'meant to be' a bad film – it just is one, end of story. Or at least it would be the end of the story if there was a story in the first place.Basically a succession of gory set pieces and bad jokes, the film lacks anything approaching suspense, wit, relevance, or even a clear understanding of the dodgy B-movies it is meant to be spoofing. The deliberately bad edits, scratches and dirt, and incomprehensible changes in film stock that at least lent Death Proof and Planet of Terror some moronic charm are here totally absent. The useless 'plot' manages to the unique trick of being both idiotically simple and confusingly fractured, and the film lacks a single likable character or performance.Perennial supporting actor Danny Trejo, recognisable from his minor roles in great films like Con Air and Heat, appeared as the titular title character in the trailer precisely because it was, within Grindhouse, another minor supporting role. He here 'reprises' that role as ex-Federale and all-round hard nut Machete, and shows exactly why he is not a leading man in Hollywood; monolithic, humourless, and as ugly as Bosnian dog, Trejo definitely cannot carry a film himself.As the 'hero' Machete, Trejo finds himself up against no less than four villains, all played by recognisable US actors with varying degrees of talent. Robert DeNiro hammers what is, for me at least, the final nail into his reputation's coffin with a competent but totally uninspired performance as a cartoonish Senator. This from the man who gave us Travis Bickle, Jake LaMotta, Jimmy Conway, and Max Cady; DeNiro should be utterly ashamed of what he has become. Don Johnson unattractively and distastefully plays a right-wing whackjob, Jeff Fahey has a bizarre role as a gun-toting super killer, overprotective father, vicious sadist, and sleazy political operator all rolled into one, and Steven Seagal, looking very different from his Under Siege glory days, turns up as (I think) an autocratic Mexican crime boss. Clearly chuffed to be back in a Hollywood A-picture after more than a decade of making direct-to-DVD dross, Seagal ignores the limits of his useless 'character' and gives the most enthusiastic performance in the film anyway.As for the women, Jessica Alba, who was starting to mature as an actress via the complex likes of The Killer Inside Me, here takes a massive career step back with a sub-'Jennifer Lopez in Out of Sight' cop role that requires her to do nothing but look good (hence the totally gratuitous shot of her in the shower); perhaps she felt obligated to accept the part for Rodriguez, whose Sin City got her noticed in the first place. Michelle Rodriguez plays another of her patented, yet tedious, 'good looking girl with a gun' parts (a la Resident Evil), whilst Lindsay Lohan takes the role of a nymphomaniac wannabe adult film star, and then gutlessly relies on a body double for all the nude shots (when you can see Lohan's face, her hair appears to be glued to her breasts, and when you can see 'her' breasts, 'her' hair obscures 'her' face).The aspect of Machete that most irritates when watching it is that one can't credit the pointlessness of it all; seldom has so much effort been put into something that will prove so unappealing to so many people. I felt the same way after watching both episodes of Tarantino's Kill Bill, which, like Machete, appeared to be made primarily for its own director's amusement. But Kill Bill, with its tedious plot and obscure appeal to mainstream audiences, at least showed a certain sense of style, something Machete definitely lacks. Very possibly the worst film of 2010, Machete makes Stallone's dire The Expendables look like The Wild Bunch by comparison.",Machete

Say Hell Yes!Machete is the most amazing, fun and entertaining movie you can watch in todays cinematic world. In a world of boring and derivative crap and stupidity comes a movie that isn't afraid to be fun again.Remember seeing a movie when you were a kid that you weren't supposed to see? Remember who much fun it was? This is that movie! It's not perfect, it's not going to win an Oscar it is there to make you laugh, and cheer and raise a fist in honor of stupid laws and white men who create them. This movie proves that nothing is sacred, blood and boobs and it is glorious! See this movie and you will have a good time, see this movie and you will remember fun pulpy schlock and why it is so interesting.Oh and one more thing, stunt casting is alive and when it is done this well it is effective and when it is done with a wink it allows the audience to be in on the joke!",Machete
232,g-white723,Plenty of blood for your bucks,5,14 August 2011,"This film is a total gore-fest with plenty of beheadings and dismemberment. I could swallow the over the top violence, but when 'Machete' becomes a bit of lover as well I found that a slash too far. Danny Trejo, the man with the unforgettable face, is 'Machete' the star of the film, but there are also notable appearances by Don Johnson, Robert De Niro, Jessica Alba and others. Also please note there are quite a lot of sexy ladies in this film, which certainly made it more watchable on my part. Still that couldn't save this film. It was a bit too long.The highlight of the film for me was when the sexy women started shooting guns: I like simple pleasures! I obviously liked Machete going on the rampage killing a few bad guys. Also, one of the stars of the film, who I nearly forgot, is Steven Segal who plays a villain very well and he says 'puneta' in nearly every sentence.",Machete
233,themkody,Favorite movie of the year. Am I Kidding? No,10,19 February 2011,"I had been waiting for this movie for three years...and it was, without a doubt, worth the wait.It all started with a fake trailer in Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino's ""Grindhouse"". Being a major fan of both directors, I've had the pleasure of seeing and enjoying all of their movies, including their double-feature, ""Grindhouse"". However, what caught my attention the most was the two-minute fake trailer Robert Rodriguez had crammed in. ""What an awesome addition to this double feature"" I thought. I mean, putting a fake trailer in Grindhouse starring Danny Trejo, one of my all-time favorite bad-asses, on a revenge trip with his precious machete, accompanied by a priest carrying two sawed-off shotguns? That trailer was an awesome idea. And when I found out shortly after that Rodriguez was gonna make a feature movie out of it, it was already at the top of my list of ""highly anticipated movies"". And finally, I went to see it in theaters back in December 2010. Not only did it live up to my expectations, Machete probably exceeded my expectations in every possible way.I'm not ashamed to say that this was one of my favorite films of 2010, as well as one of my all-time favorite action/comedy movies ever committed to celluloid. It's corny, messy, entertaining, brutal and over-the-top-but-in-a-good-way, real (m)exploitation style. Most important of all, it's amusing. I can't recall the last time I laughed so hard watching a movie. Ever since the 90's, Danny Trejo have always been one of those guys I'd watch in a horrible cheesy movie, just because he would star in it. Also, I love when film stars are nice to their fans. Having watched a lot of his interviews, Danny Trejo is probably one of the kindest actors out there (ironically, the mean guys are always the ones who are nice to their fans.)Danny Trejo plays the title character Machete, a role that was meant to be played by him. No Mexican actor could ever pull this off as good as Trejo did. He is undoubtedly the star of this movie, and it shows. He is amusing, entertaining, and radiates cool in every single scene. Then there's Cheech Marin, who plays a priest (and Machete's brother). He is perfect for the role, and is equally cool and amusing in addition to Trejo. Steven Seagal is also one worth mentioning, who plays the villain (his first villainous role ever). Then there's Robert De Niro, Jessica Alba, Michelle Rodriguez, Jeff Fahey, Lindsay Lohan and Don Johnson (probably his best role since Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man). The characters they portray are really, really cheesy, but in a good way! It is purely intentional, alas self-parody. I'm impressed they got DeNiro to play one of the villains. They truly picked the right actors for the roles, I enjoyed every second of their cheesiness. It takes skill to play characters so much over-the-top as the actors in Machete did. In short, saying this film is lacking a decent cast would be a fallacy.The plot is what you would expect from this kind of movies (pretty much identical to most comedy/action flicks) but that should be pretty obvious, and is by no means a drawback. Who would've expected a genre-defining plot anyway?I can't describe in words how hilarious and refreshing this movie is. I never thought Rodriguez could make a movie as fun as ""Desperado"" but I was wrong. There are so many memorable one-liners, and we get a lot of ass-whooping, gut-spilling and comedy (combined). The entertainment value is simply top notch. This is hopefully just the beginning, for here is one major fan who is truly looking forward to ""Machete Kills"" and ""Machete Kills Again"" as suggested at the credits. There's not much else to say about this film, it doesn't really have a deeper meaning (thank god) or anything that requires your brain to work properly.So, why did some people hate this? They probably got turned off by what they thought to be ""political propaganda"". Haha, can you believe it? You know Rodriguez got the job done when he successfully offended at least a handful of people. This is clearly a self-parody, and mocks people on both sides of the border. People shouldn't get offended by this at all, and if they did, they just saw the movie from a wrong perspective. To me, it just sounds like an excuse for having no sense of humour. But heck, to each his own I guess. The avid Rodriguez fan should have nothing to worry about.One of the funniest and coolest films in years - Moose finds this film worthy of a 10.",Machete

I fact, I was still laughing 5 minutes after I left the cinema.If he wasn't already so old I would say Danny Trejo was an undiscovered talent set for a meteoric rise, but the guy is already 64. I never could have guessed as the adrenaline and action pumped incessantly.... and hysterically this weather-beaten old dude also managed effortlessly to bed any chiquita he came across, and in style too.Machete kills and maims and has sex all the way through the movie, but amazingly he is also a gentleman. you have to love him.The best movie I have seen this year and the best movie of this genre for some time.

235,BlackTaterTotallyBlue,Rodriguez's most enjoyable flick to date.,8,19 May 2011,"Since director Robert Rodriguez's collaboration with Quentin Tarantino on the gangster come vampire romp, From Dusk till Dawn (1996), the pair have continued to pay tribute to the 70s exploitation aesthetic. Early films by the likes of John Carpenter and Russ Meyer belong to a bygone era that both men cherished in their youth and have since sought to resurrect in the multiplexes of today.This latest effort from Rodriguez has seen an unusual journey to the screen. The character first appeared almost a decade ago in Spy Kids, an ongoing series of PG rated films that Rodriguez makes primarily for his children. Then in 2007 came a faux Machete trailer, sandwiched between the Grindhouse double bill of Tarantino's Death Proof and Rodriguez's Planet Terror. Enthused fans of that trailer inspired Rodriguez set to work on developing it into a full blown feature.Machete centers around the titular cop turned killer (rugged looking Danny Trejo) who shares a name with his weapon of choice as he attempts to thwart the efforts of a corrupt Texan senator (Robert De Niro) in constructing a new militarized fence along the Mexican border. The casting throws forth many surprises in the form of Don Johnson, Steven Seagal and an irreverent self parody from Lindsay Lohan. One would be ill advised to search for substance in this film, but if you did, you just might find it in Rodriguez's heavy handed satire (De Niro's Texan senator shoots a pregnant border crosser for fun and espouses vitriol against 'Change') and an obvious compassion for fellow Latinos living and working in his native Texas. One suspects that Jessica Alba's rallying war cry ""We didn't cross the border, the border crossed us!!"" holds a modicum of weight for the scribes. Asides from this, the film is not taking itself too seriously, rather it revels in gore soaked silliness. Previous Rodriguez fare, such as Once Upon A Time In Mexico and Planet Terror could seem messy and unfocused. This film is structurally more cohesive and consequently much more enjoyable. One wonders if the improvement can be credited to Rodriguez's new directing partner Ethan Maniquis (notably, also his regular film editor). In any case, Rodriguez has succeeded in crafting his most enjoyable film to date. If you are of a fragile disposition, you should avoid this film. If you've never heard of Tom Savini and disposable cartoon carnage is not normally your bag, you should remove a star or two from this review.

Violent and bloody at times, stereotypes abound...can't wait for the next two sequels. Michelle Rodgriguez is HOT! So is Lohan (and I hope she gets her act together). Trejo is the Man...Machete....I don't know any other Hispanic actor that could've pulled this role off. Okay, so now Jessica Alba wants to be Mexican? I forgive her for trying to be the white Sue Storm. DeNiro is great without going over the top. I thought ""and introducing Don Johnson"" was kinda weird, but then again, he needs something to revive his career.",Machete
237,patrickmbrame,"Graphically Violent, Fun, and of course Terrible",8,8 January 2011,"Graphically violent, Fun, and of course Terrible but what do you except from a movie that was made from a fake movie trailer from Grindhouse. The worst mistake you can make is going into this thinking its going to have good characters and plausible storyline because that's the last thing you will get. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and what's not to love. Over the top violence, ridiculous storyline, Steven Seagal playing a Samurai wielding Mexican Cartel Boss with a terrible accent, Lindsay Lohan playing herself (a porn star, crack/cocaine/heroin addict whose the daughter of a wealthy bad guy), and the famous and Fugly Danny Trejo who hardly utters any kind of dialogue but is the first one to seduce Jessica Alba and Michell Rodriguez and save the day all in one. With all that being said, the very loose social commentary it does have on illegal immigrants does remind you of what is going on in the the border states and Robert De Niro plays a great ""McCain/Bush"" Senator that could really be any far right public office holder in those areas. One of the coolest parts of the film is if you've seen the trailer from Grindhouse, almost every shot that was in that is in the movie. If you want to zone out for 90 minutes, laugh and have fun (and don't mind the extreme violence) I highly recommend this Oscar quality family film. I can't wait for the trilogy finale of Machete Kills and Machete Kills Again...",Machete
238,DamnYouGoogle,A love letter to violence,8,8 October 2010,"My oh my I knew this was going to be awesome. I was trying to decide tonight, what should I watch tonight, Finding Neverland, Woyzeck, or Machete, and while Im sure the other two are going to be great, or at least watchable I think I made the best choice, this tribute to exploitation at its best and Danny Trejo's much deserved starring role in a major motion picture, the acting ranges from superb to terrible, and I wouldn't have it any other way, things are never explained, people are always at the right place at the right time, some special effects are top notch, others are love letters to films like 2000 Maniacs once again I couldn't think of it being anymore well crafted, the contrast between great, and horrible is so over the top it's nearly perfect.The downside is that the film is draining, the first 40 minutes are so in your face, that by the time you get to the 75th minute you feel like the movie has given you all that it has to offer...granted I found it not to be the case I can see it being a major problem to others.Im gonna keep it funky with you guys, in all honesty this movie is an 8.5, but I don't do .5's because thats the cowards way out, so im just gonna go balls to the wall and give Machete a solid, 9 out of 10.

It's so bad that it's good. Better than good. The violence is cartoon-like in it's excess, and always done with a tongue in the cheek. No can of fake blood was spared in the making of this film, and the slayings were so thick and fast, so creative, that I expected Wile E Coyote to appear at any moment.Even the clichés were well handled, and the intentional humour content very well done. Especially the dark humour.This isn't Shakespeare. Nor Tarantino.

240,inkslave,One of the best crappy movies I've ever seen,7,23 August 2012,"There isn't enough suspension of disbelief in the world to get you through ""Machete."" But you won't care. So many blades and body parts are flying, so many really good actors are vamping the hell out of their parts, it simply doesn't matter.I do wish Danny Trejo got more work that did justice to his talent. His sting on ""Real Housewives"" showed he's capable of more than just gritting his teeth and chopping people up. And see ""Heat"" to watch him and his buddy Bobby DeNiro, whose performance in this movie is jaw-droppingly awful because that was what he was aiming for, flex their acting muscles some.I had a chance to meet Trejo a few years ago on the set of yet another really bad movie. With him was his shaman, who was his only entourage, an older man who also had done hard time and emerged stronger for it. I was deeply impressed by Trejo's spirituality and his intellect, and his very sly sense of humor. Then he went and chopped some people up. It was glorious.Until the day comes when someone realizes what Trejo could do with a real script, I will blissfully watch him make the most of trash. He's the Marlon Brando of arterial spurts.",Machete
241,Movieboy_20,A genuine homage.,8,13 November 2010,"In the midst of an immigration crisis, a Mexican day labourer known only as Machete (Danny Trejo) attempts to assassinate the fruitless Senator McLaughlin (Robert De Niro), only to be shot and left for dead by the very people who hired him. But, unfortunately for them, Machete is actually alive and ready to return to the glorious days of being a Federale as he, aided by a plethora of sharp objects, slashes his way to bitter revenge. Although, as the fiasco soon grows into a colossal war of race across the border, Machete realizes this mess goes a whole lot deeper than he initially expected...Like many classic exploitation romps, Machete has intentionally corny subtext as well as ridiculously excessive violence. The immigration issue is obviously something very close to Robert Rodriguez, and he conveys everything he has to say about it as he does best; through celluloid. His disdain is explicit down to every last bumbling redneck meeting the ferocious blade of Machete. One of the more overtone-rich scenes is towards the end where the Senator is helplessly stumbling across the border fence, and a bunch of sociopathic rednecks mistake him as a Mexican as they shoot him dead in cold blood; simply, this is Rodriguez encouraging all the right-wing extremists of Texas to, for a moment, put themselves in the shoes of a refugee. Perhaps, this may be the most poignant scene of a very intriguing film.As you would expect, all this subtext isn't subtle in the slightest sense; it's overbearing and incredibly crude like the majority of exploitation films that trod this fickle path back in the day. But heck, you can't deny that Rodriquez has crafted one helluva' genuine homage through this deft accuracy, as he nails the tone of exploitation as well as carrying on with the visceral components that have become popular in recent mainstream cinema.Of course, the blood comes in gallons as Machete offs his adversaries in creatively excessive and ridiculous fashion - A personal favourite of mine would be when Machete swings out a window with an intestine in tow. The writing is a mere reflection of the cheese and sleaze of trashy cinema, packed to the brim with hilarious one-liners and slapstickery. The cast is nothing short of awesome as it meshes insanely beautiful women, acclaimed actors, B-Grade powerhouses and dirty Hollywood whores for strikingly wide pallet of personalities who light up the screen in their own special ways. The sword-fight between Danny Trejo and Steven Seagal was utter awesomeness incarnate.Overall, this is a fun and genuine homage to B-Grade cinema. I recommend it to all genre fans, plus people who just want a good time at the movies. Viva Mexploitation!",Machete

Heart stopping is stretching this movie a bit far, it's just one you go to see, when you wanna forget certain physical logic, and ideas, to have some fun. The characters are pretty generic, and a man who constantly refers to himself by a title, and not his own name. The movie had potential, and was entertaining for a little while. I'd give it about a 6, for the combination of everything, the story elements did happen to stand out though, despite the usual clichés.

Danny Trejo is outstanding as is Robert DeNiro and a host of other well known faces however the stand out has to be Steven Seagal playing a villain for the first time which he is better suited for in reality, Seagal is a bad guy in real life by all accounts so it only makes sense that he's more convincing in that kind of role.

Strong and funny characters, and in this movie with a lot of legendary actors. Here you meet Don Johnson, Steven Seagal, Jeff Fahey and Robert De Niro. All of them are great in this film. In some way this is like ""pulp fiction"" or ""kill bill"" if you should compare. Or a bit like ""El mariachi"" that Rodriguez made 18 years ago. The ladies in this movie are also something special. Sexy, but also smart and brave. The main character played by Danny Trejo is great. And he use his machete so brilliantly that its hard not too laugh when people are split apart.This movie does also have some intelligent meaning in the way many see immigrants from Mexico. if you like a movie where you can laugh and have fun, eat popcorn and talk about some scenes after a movie, this is the movie.

So it was easy to get excited when the news came out that the interest it generated was enough to bankroll a full feature.Alas, the Machete trailer was superior not only to Grindhouse, it was also superior to Machete, the movie. Where the trailer was tight, focused, and perfectly edited, the movie, in an effort to fill the length of the feature, becomes a flat, uninspired mess. The trailer is a pleasure to watch to this day.

After seeing the trailer i said i feel like this is going to be like Once upon a time in Mexico, which to me is not a good thing. Once upon a time in Mexico was supposed to be a sequel to desperado but the desperado characters are in the movie for a whopping 20mins. Same thing happens in this movie. There is more Alba and rodriguez then Machete. I don't care to see them, I am here to see machete kick ass and there wasn't enough of that which makes it disappointing.

I really did Rodriguez's multiple talent and doing a lot of post production work in his own place even playing music. Maybe not in this movie totally. You are really sure that he has control and reach on the final outcome.Machete is what it is a B-movie but it does have some political undertones which is not bad. We enjoy the hedonistic pleasure of our society because of the illegal immigrant, the Mexican illegal immigrant in particular, who by the way is equally exploited in his/her won country as well. I am glad that they are given a voice even in this medium.Lindsay Lohan. I am really rooting for this girls in spite of the troubles, she's had. She' one of the better actors that Disney has manufactured and it is hard once Uncle Disney let's you go. I also think that they used a body double whenever there is a Lohan breast scene. The one where you see her face, it was covered by her hair. So sorry to disappoint if you are into Lindsay's front rack, because it's not there.I really enjoy Tarantino and Rodriguez. If I have to do it all over again and someone asked what do you want to be when you grown up, I'll like to be Robert Rodriguez.Danny Freyo is amazing. I have always liked him. And if you want to not fall in love. do not look into Jessica or Michelle. They are too much. Cheech, Don, Jeff.

Seagal is back on the big screen , I was expecting a cameo because of what I have seen on the trailer before seeing this , but surprisingly, he was the main villain and he did it really quite well and so did the rest of the cast like Fahey, Deniro, and Don Johnson. Violence was over the top and cartoonish which is why I don't get why people have an issue about the anti immigration war depicted in the film, It was a satire kind of grindhouse action flick like the other R.Rodriguez films which should not be taken seriously.I know the film seems tasteless with the overwhelming gore and nudity but that's the Grindhouse-feel the director was aiming for,This clearly ain't Inception... but people like and rate movies based on how entertained they were while watching a film, because other movies may have the best award winning plot but can still bore you to death and this movie ain't that, It entertains and is worth the watch, Just expect over the top gore and a silly plot with lots of great action and your good to go.",Machete

But, like most low-budget movies, the ending was the same and everything was predictable.

Let me mention Michelle Rodriguez separately once more, not just because I always had a celebrity crush on her, but also because of her appearance in the climax scene.

Maybe nobody does shallow better than Rodriguez, but when one of my favourite shots is a split-second of De Niro hopping bound hand and foot, and that this is probably the best part of his performance, I'm hoping that Rodriguez finds a real story to tell soon. (Surely can't be that difficult!) So it gets a 7 for good-clean gratuitous sex and violence, for as long as I believe the sequel trailers are just an extension of the Grindhouse joke!

Lindsay Lohan naked AND the lovely Michelle Rodriguez selling Tacos? Except for the weird dream I had last night, the answer would be ""Machete."" I only watched this movie because of the cult-like fan base that has begun to sprout around it. If you know that Danny Trejo is going to be in a movie, with a few exceptions like 'Spy Kids,' you know that it's only going to be action, and that's what this movie is...Machete (Trejo) is an ex-Federale who's life was turned upside down by a drug kin-pin (Seagal). (You've probably heard that Segal is a tall man. But, in this movie, his height is actually put into perspective, and let me tell ya... He is one tall S.O.B.) So, he escapes to good ol' Uncle Sam's backyard and lives the life of an illegal immigrant. But, he now has to deal with a governor who is basically like a Mini-Me Dubya and a bunch of redneck Xenophobic Texans, whose ultimate goal is to build a fence (at least on the surface) to stop the illegal boarder crossings...Obviously, Machete gets in the middle and queue the BANG-BANGs, the SLICE-SLICEs, the PFFFT-PFFFTs (of blood spurting out, that is), and the 70's funk porn music....! That's right! In this world, Trejo is a ladies' man!! Danny Trejo get's kissed by Jessica Alba, Lindsay Lohan's mother (not the real one, but a character), and Lindsay Lohan.Man, I'd love to have been at Alba's contract negotiation room and Lohan's negotiation room. The producers must have been like ""Alba, we'll pay you a million bucks extra if you kiss Trejo"" and ""Lohan, if you want to be in this movie, kiss Trejo""....ROFLMAO.....Either way, this movie is no way an Oscar winning collection of scenes. But, it's just an action movie with some humor in it. It's kind of like Kill Bill. But instead of Thurman you have Trejo, and instead of deep dialogues you have Jessica Alba naked in the shower and Lindsay Lohan naked in the pool...So, for action, this movie gets a 4/10.

256,renee-844-417622,Why We Need Machete - The Movie And The Man,9,15 November 2010,"Revenge is the central theme of a lot of films and the reason they are so popular is because they touch something deep within humanity.It's the inherent desire for justice.We like to get our fix via film because it's too haphazard an unreliable in real life. We can't count on justice unless other variables come into play such as having a better lawyer on the day or a lot of cash so justice can be bought.Life isn't fair. Bill Gates told us that. I don't know how he knows but he's right. It's a series of haphazard events that occur largely due to cause-and-effect but not due to any morality or innate fairness.The truth is – people don't always get what they deserve.That's why we need Machete.And it's very exciting to see Danny Trejo get a good solid lead role. He's a strong actor with a hell of a face and physique. He makes support roles memorable.But like David Morse and Steve Buscemi, you know his face but not his name. Trejo has never really had top billing with any great recognition. And he rarely gets the girl. Even in Con Air where he played a serial rapist, he didn't get the girl because Nic Cage saved her (which under the circumstances was a good thing).But in Machete Trejo doesn't just get the girl – he gets all the girls. And it was heart-warming to see. He's kind of like an organic Mexican Terminator and has that unrelenting drive of Chigurh in No Country For Old Men – it's like he's had passion replaced with programming.Machete is the latest film from Robert Rodriguez. He's been described as the Mexican Tarantino. Machete is described as a Mexploitation movie.In a nutshell, it's the story of a highly skilled operative who gets set up in a political assassination plot and has to clear his name. Other friends and foes include a racist senator (Robert De Niro who looks like the KFC dude Colonel Sanders); a female version of Ché Guevara called She (Michelle Rodriguez); an immigration official (Jessica Alba); a drug king pin (a tubby Steven Seagal); the padre (Cheech Marin); a disobedient daughter (Lindsay Lohan who must have thought it was a documentary) and even Don Johnson gets a gig.The issue that makes this movie so much more than a B grade exploitation film, is that it addresses the real issue of US racism and denial of basic human rights as well as the price America pays for their propaganda about being the land of the free and the brave where anyone can make a whole lot of capitalist cashola with scant regard for how they do it. There is some terrific irony found in the tools of trades illegal immigrants use in their blue collar jobs in the US because in Machete, they are the tools of that other cleaning enterprise – the criminal cleaning business of wiping people out. In real life, Mexicans might be taking out the trash for US employers. In Machete, the main Mexican is taking out the human trash – with extreme prejudice.There's nothing like a sharp machete to shave some human crud off the face of the Earth! One of the fun things in this film is the revival of the Six Million Dollar Man staccato metallic sound effect of his bionic body parts in action.It's a lavish, lusty production. It's not torture porn but it is action porn. And there's an escape from a building using the internal organ of a human that will go down in cinema history. I've only ever seen this in an Itchy & Scratchy cartoon. It is gruesome comedy at its B grade best.The music by Chignon (Spanish for 'Bad Ass') is just mesmerizing to the ears – that's Rodriguez's band and Tarantino got Rodriguez to score Kill Bill Vol 2 with it.There's a scene reminiscent of the final shoot-out in Scarface and there's an Eva Peron moment as well as a possible passing nod to the assassination of JFK.Another plus is it's a car lovers wet dream. I'm talking about real cars – muscle autos and hot rods with custom paint jobs and deeply sexy bodies that you just want to be inside and drive (sigh) Back to Danny Trejo for moment. I see beyond his big scary appearance. His past is etched into his body – a chunk of time in jail then a long time counseling troubled youth about drugs and crime shows he's spent more time caring than scaring.He is a simple paradox - an incredible philanthropic soul housed in a misanthropic body. The wonderful thing is the devoted fan base he's generated without being an A list star.When Rodriguez made the fake Machete trailer for Grindhouse and it became a hit with requests for the film to be made, Trejo learned how deeply his fans were committed.He says, 'when I was in England a few years ago, I was stopped by these guys who had tattoos of the character Machete on their backs. When I signed my name above their tattoos, they had my signature tattooed as well.' (quoted from the Machete production notes 2011) Now that's love. And it softens my cynical old heart like a metal mallet does to a pound of steak.Machete is fun to see on the big screen and despite the howls of protest I can already hear from film purists – I would love to see it in 3D.And while I'm out on a limb here, I'll also say I'm looking forward to the sequel.Maybe Danny Trejo has his franchise.Now I guess it's time I got that tattoo.",Machete
257,zombie134,Not the best and not the worst,5,7 September 2010,"For me this movie started out quite well. The beginning had that cheap B-movie feel to it. Grainy video, a little gratuitous nudity and lots of bloody violence. It had all most of what I enjoy about a Rodriquez film like Dusk til Dawn had. After about 45 minutes though the movie started to lag a bit. The violence, although still present, began to be replaced by a script that was for the most part kinda silly. After Machete leaves the hospital I became pretty disinterested and just waited for the movie to finish. I did enjoy seeing Danny Trejo in a lead role though. He deserves it and did no worse than Stallone, Arnold or Van Damme. In fact I really liked his character. Steven Seigal is terrible though. Lohan is, well, what can you say, she's Lindsay. Michelle Rodriquez does an excellent job, better than Alba in my opinion. Plus Michelle is like way hotter! The ending is just plain silly and seems like they just didn't feel like finishing the script.Acting = 6 Script = 4.5 Action = 6 Editing = 7.5 Sets = 5 Costumes = 5 Lighting = 5 Camera = 5.5 Action = 6.5 Sex = 4 Directing = 6 Creativity = 6.75",Machete

Have enjoyed previous films' from Robert Rodriguez but this turkey of distorted details created by those making the film and felt that integrating their views into an action film with talented individuals though Seagal & Alba were bad and/or unconvincing in their roles would work to their advantage, well they failed.

261,rockitpoh,Good Action Comedy - But I expected a bit more.,7,29 December 2010,"After seeing the ""spoof"" trailer at the beginning of Deathproof I thought to myself, what a great movie that would make. And sure enough a few years later, due to popular demand Robert Rodriguez churns out a full length version for all to see, and on a relatively small budget. The Film itself is a great idea with some very fun and entertaining scenes. Danny Trejo plays the part of a bad ass Mexican law enforcer with a fondness for lopping bad guys heads off with a very large machete. The film also features some great names. Robert DeNiro, Jessica Alba, Don Johnson, a sometimes butt naked Lindsay Lohan and a surprisingly good performance from Steven Seagal. Machete doesn't disappoint on an action or gore level and the odd bit of hot chick nudity is quite welcome as well. I guess at the end of the day it ticks all the boxes for a 14 year old boys favourite flick. And the cheesy, exploitive 70's style in which its made is quite refreshing, in a way. The only thing I found is that dialogue scenes where a little boring and pointless. I found myself wanting to fast forward to all the action, gore and nudity. I must also say that Danny Trejo didn't quite for fill the part for me. Although he is the only actor that could ever play the part of Machete, he didn't quite seem hardcore or Bad ass enough. If your a Rodriguez fan, you wont be disappointed but don't expect from Dusk till Dawn. Well worth a watch if your a 15 year old boy or feel like a good laugh with some mates.",Machete

264,omfgitsrohit,Machete kills Rodriguez' fan club.,4,9 January 2011,"I'd been waiting to see Machete after I saw the fake trailer of it in Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino's Grindhouse. I enjoyed both parts of Grindhouse, Planet Terror and Death Proof. While I liked Death Proof more, I felt Planet Terror deserved more appreciation.But Machete? I can't find one reason to recommend this film to another person. It's not so much of a misfire or a disappointment. It's too dull to be given even that much of importance. A movie like this isn't one I expect to satisfy my intellectual appetite, so I don't pay much attention. Its entertainment value is supposed to grab my attention. Does it do so? Not one bit. I won't tell you what it's about, there's nothing special about it. There's gore, in amounts that neither entertains nor provokes you. The film's a snooze. In trying to recall the film, I remember it ends with nuns, priests, rock n roll stars(who have picked up a trait or two from 50 cent) and Mexican parasites in blood lust mode, all of them spraying away bullets hoping to reach orgasm. It's a blood bath, sadly, not of the holy Christ. The screenplay is laughable with dialogs that are caricatures of already existing catch-phrases. ""You Just F*ck-ed With The Wrong Mexican."" Woah! That did send a shiver down my spine. Jessica Alba gets on top of a car and screams "" We didn't cross the border, the border crossed us."" A crucified priest decides to say ""God has mercy, I don't. You go to hell."" Cool? Smart? Maybe, if you have just reached adolescence. Danny Trejo is lethally magnetic but nothing that Machete does is even close. Machete's a guy with enough scars to prevent his dead body from being recognized, constipated expressions that'll make you restrain your laughter(Out of, not fear, but pity), a cartoon like raucous voice and a weapon belt with a lot of knives that look like they were stolen from some old lady's kitchen at midnight. If anything, I'm glad I watched this cheap gimmick because it's been on my hard disk long enough, now I can free 1.22 GB. But you don't have to sit through 100 minutes watching it, just to free your hard disk, you could take my word and delete it right away. I know, there's a lot about the film I haven't talked about. Those aspects just exist, they are not worthy of criticism.Before the credit rolls, we're asked to look forward to sequels. Machete Kills. Machete Kills again. The missing object in the sentence is Robert Rodriguez' reputation.Rating - 4/10",Machete
265,dgefuller,Grindhouse: The Revenge,8,13 October 2010,"Remember when Tarantino's 'Death Proof' and Rodriguez's 'Planet Terror' were going to be a double feature called 'Grindhouse'? If you were one of the lucky who actually got to see 'Grindhouse' in the cinema (all 4 butt-numbing hours of it), you may have seen the 'fake' trailers. If you picked up the 'Planet Terror' DVD (which, to be honest, you should have by now) then you will have seen the surviving mock trailer for a film that never was called 'Machete'. As you may or may not know (although you probably do if you're even remotely interested in this film), this film is the adaptation of that trailer. Yes, somewhere in the world of film someone has finally made a movie based on an advert (although in all fairness, this was an advert for something that didn't exist- I'd like to think of it as reverse engineering a film rather than scraping the barrel of ideas).If you like straight-to-DVD action movies, or 70's revenge thrillers, then this piece of pulp entertainment is for you. If you enjoyed the self-aware schlockfest that was 'Planet Terror', you're probably who this movie is meant for. If, however, you are looking for a rich, thought-provoking conspiracy thriller, you might want to try 'Edge of Darkness' instead, because you'll get no reward here.Like it's 'Grindhouse' counterparts, you can't really define 'Machete' as good or bad. If you look at other films in the same sort of vein (Ninja Squad, for example) it's head and shoulders above a lot of them. In fact, it's refreshingly cheap and simple. It's big, dumb, macho fun- full of guns, violence, girls and VENGEANCE!!! It's pure, b-movie entertainment and Danny Trejo seems to be having fun in a rare leading role (to be honest, he is a pretty fearsome looking chap and fits the part perfectly).The fight scenes (for the most part death scenes, really) are hilariously over-the-top, and our titular hero makes great use of his environments (picking up tools in a hospital, Machete is advised ""we use that to scrape the bones clean""... he also makes great use of some unguarded gardening equipment). And frankly, the way he escapes from the hospital is just inspired.The supporting cast knows their place- Alba, Rodriguez, Segal (showing some rare humility with a bit of self-parody- I hope)... as well as some star turns from Jeff Fahey's hair all fit in nicely, although Cheech Marin's potentially excellent sidekick priest, Don Johnson's fascist boarder cop and De Niro's racist senator are sadly underused (yeah, that's right- not enough Don Johnson). Lindsay Lohan shows up to get naked, and that's pretty much all she's there for. But then considering the rest of the film, it makes perfect sense.There's not really much to say about 'Machete'. What you see is what you get- booze, broads and bullets. It's pulp entertainment in the Grindhouse mold; lo-fi, brazen and balls-to-the-wall stupid fun. You could argue it's a post-modern homage to the low budget action thrillers of the 70's and 80's, or you could just relax and enjoy a film that isn't trying to test you or challenge you and failing, a film that isn't trying to be state-of-the-art tech, a film that isn't trying to insult your intelligence with stupid twists- a film that is just a hell of a lot of dumb fun.

268,guiltron,Humor and violence - Grindhouse style,7,13 December 2010,"Machete is Robert Rodriguez's film based on his mock trailer made for the double grindhouse release of Quentin Tarantino's Death Proof and his own Planet Terror. B-Grade superstar Danny Trejo stars as the title character. Those that have seen the mock trailer, or the grindhouse films, know the style of yester-year that Machete is representing. Cheap, nasty, and funny is the order of the day for this kind of film. Rodriguez clearly knows his genre and audience. He goes all out with this over-the-top action flick. The story is, of course, ridiculous. Machete is betrayed by some ""above the law"" dudes and has to get revenge by slicing and dicing whoever gets in his way. The film does what it says on the cover. Don't go in expecting a glimmer of subtlety or characterization. Go in expecting action, titties, action, blood, titties, oh and action. This would be all well and good except for some slight problems. The unashamedly preachy messages against the Mexican/United States border does get a bit tiring, as does the repetitive nature of the violence (after some interesting action set- pieces they all become similar, except towards the end). Also, this kind of film needs to be much snappier and shorter. It's around twenty minutes too long so that the humor and overall style tends to drag on a bit. Machete holds it's tongue permanently in cheek and Danny Trejo milks every scene as much as he possibly can. Jessica Alba, Michelle Rodriguez and Lindsay Lohan all make for good eye candy and there are some very funny moments. All in all, this exercise in grindhouse excess should keep the fans of this style very happy, even if it can slightly bore others.",Machete

270,ckelly-35763,Danny You Magnificent B*******,8,6 August 2019,"Let's talk Danny Trejo.
When he was younger Trejo had a troubled past. He started out as a thug, committing various crimes, being addicted to drugs, and going from jail to jail. However, things changed. He became a better person, entered a twelve step program, and cleaned up his act. In 1985, things got interesting. While he was working as a youth drug counselor, a teenage patient asked for assistance with cocaine problems on the set of Runaway Train. While there, he was asked to be a boxing coach for lead actor Eric Roberts, and even got the role of Eric's opponent. From there, Trejo's acting career began, and the roles kept coming.
Now that we've talked about Trejo's history, let me talk about my opinion on him as an actor and person. To put it simply, I think he's great. Not only is he a personal favorite actor of mine, but he seems like a really nice and humble guy who loves his fans.
As for the movie itself, I love it. After years of playing the drug dealer or side character, Trejo gets a leading role, and damn is he good. He has a natural presence and Machete himself is a very interesting character. The supporting cast also does a great job, and I especially love Cheech Marin as the gun-toting preacher.
The film also has some clear things to say about immigration and border nuts, and does so while being smart and not overly preachy.
Finally, the gore. It is grindhouse in every sense of the word and I love it. The practical effects work wonders and boy is it not for the squeamish. However, if you're a gorehound like me there is a lot to love.
All in all, this film isn't for everyone, but if this sounds like your kind of film I highly recommend it.",Machete

272,funero,Movie that tries much and fails at everything,4,1 November 2010,"I had high hopes from this movie. If someone knows how to make an exploitative quasi-B movie gore-fest, it's Rodriguez. It started good, too. The first scene and opening credits were exactly what was needed to put me in the right mood. And then, the rest of the movie happened.Roughly speaking, there are three types of scenes that are mashed together into this film - politics, sex and action.1. PoliticsI'm not really invested in the whole immigration issue (not an American), but even to me it was obvious Rodriguez chose to present his view with all the objectiveness and finesse of a bulldozer. OK, so not every movie has to pussyfoot down the middle lane and try not to offend anyone, I get that. The problem is, even from the pure propaganda standpoint, Rodriguez did a terrible job of turning me against American immigration policy!Not a single Mexican character in this film came out overly sympathetic or righteous. Instead of showing me why the deportation of illegal immigrants is wrong (waste of effort, breaking up families etc), the film takes its assortment of morally gray Mexican criminals and pits them against cartoonishly evil Americans, hoping they might look better in contrast. The ending was particularly distressing, what with every day laborer in town receiving a signal from this underground organization, taking a gun and rising in a bloody revolution against the locals. If I was a Texan, I'd definitely start keeping a closer eye on old Pedro in the backyard and call my Congressman about that border fence they were promising to build.Good job, Rodriguez, you really made your point.2. SexSo, here's this middle-aged, scared, barely speaking, scary looking Mexican guy, wooing literally every female he stumbles across. A cop who's supposed to arrest him for the admitted attempted murder, an underground leader whose organization he had just compromised, a rich girl and her mother who think he's a day laborer... it matters not to MACHETE, within minutes each one is putty in his hands. He usually doesn't even have to open his mouth, one look of his soulless murderer eyes is enough to completely break their defenses.""Relax, it's not supposed to make sense, it's just an exploitation movie, man!"", positive reviewers would say, I gather.Only, it's not. Not really. An exploitation movie is just that, exploitation of a theme through action and sex. It doesn't try to have a point or a political agenda. This one does.Here's the thing. You can't have me all invested into immigrant plight at one moment, and then jump straight into instant-seduction in next. When are you joking and when not? What parts am I to take seriously? Is this happening in real world or a cartoon?I've read a lot of rave reviews about an 'exploitation flick with a brain' and stuff like that. For me, it's the exact opposite. Instead of complimenting one another, the two parts clash, leaving only a mess behind.3) ActionOK, so the plot and the message are a little shaky, but we've all seen that fantastic trailer in Grindhouse. You have a huge Mexican dude chopping guys to pieces in creative ways, hot chicks with big guns, minigun bikes and Steven Seagul with a katana. How can you go wrong with that?You'd think you can't, but Rodriguez somehow managed to screw up action even worse than in Planet Terror. Whether it's editing, choreography or directing (probably all of the above), action sequence in this movie just don't work.Danny Trejo is especially problematic. He may look tough, but seeing him lumber through fight scenes, it's obvious he has neither the physique nor charisma to sell himself as a big action hero. It's only through copious editing that he manages not to get shot (standard trick of him just appearing where he needs to be to chop guys down).But even if he were the new Schwarzenegger, it wouldn't improve the overall impression. Bad choreography and the complete lack of fluidity and realism would still kill any momentum an occasional neat move might generate.The funny thing is, this realization sort of creeps up on you, so by the time you realize that what you're watching is just BAD, it's too late to shut it down (or walk out). Instead of upping the ante as the plot rolls by, leading up to an explosive finale, Rodriguez somehow managed to do the exact opposite. The best action 'Machete' has is in its opening sequence. The tempo and quality gradually drop throughout the movie, to reach the rock bottom in the end.The less said about the ending, the better. All the worst action and political 'messages' (calls to lynch, more accurately) are crammed in those awful 5 minutes. I fast forwarded through some of it, but what I saw was enough to cement my opinion of 'Machete'.Bad politics, bad acting and bad action don't make a movie worthy of such a high score on IMDb (7.4 at the time of writing this). A few juicy gore shots (that you probably saw in trailers anyway) and the solid first 30-45 minutes barely raise 'Machete' up to 4 stars on my scale.",Machete
273,marlon_jackson,Very funny movie!,9,1 October 2010,"Some comments on some of the reviews:I have to agree with the reviewers that thought this was a hilarious movie. Every scene had something funny about it. Most had multiple jokes embedded. And many of the jokes were completely non-PC and stereotypical of races. And I'm sure all of the jokes were intentional. Half the Mexican protagonists in the movie are carrying some sort of gardening or janitorial equipment. If you aren't amused seeing an old Hispanic dude running into battle with a toilet plunger, this isn't the movie for you.But I got a few laughs reading reviews who thought this movie is an attempt at serious political statement. It's completely stereotypical on purpose and for laughs. It's not a movie that is trying to change anyone's mind. Get real! In the same way that ""The Man"" is the antagonist in the Blacksploitation genre, evil rich white and Hispanic men and stereotypically stupid rednecks are the antagonists in this movie. There is no attempt to make these characters resemble reality. They kill anyone they come across for the fun of it. This isn't an exercise in real race relations like the Milagro Beanfield War or The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada anymore than Foxy Brown is like The Color Purple.",Machete
274,silviuleno,"Machete, a great achievement",10,15 September 2010,"i don't understand those who criticize Machete for his lack of originality. the movie is another great achievement from the ""cabron"" of stylish violence set as iconic, Rodriguez. The cast of Machete makes the movie, not the story. But the lack of originality doesn't bother me at all, as long as i'm entertained with some of the best and worst actors put together in a really comic story. The ""myth"" of the bloody Machete is established and this is that achievement i'm talking about. Actually, i would like to see Danny Trejo (OSCAR performance IMO) taking the bulls in Machete 2, 3, 4, 5...Because Machete sticks in your mind and heart like one of those old action movies with Stallone, Van Damme or Lundgren. The cast includes great action stars, as Jeff Fahey, Don Johnson, Steven Seagal and the venerable Robert DE Niro in a fit role, not spectacular, but fit. In my opinion, Machete could be a serious threat to the other movies at the Oscars 2011. I see some normalizations, as Danny Trejo for Best Actor, for his amazing portrait of fictional MACHETE, best picture, for Rodriguez's almost perfect style of directing the action scenes and maybe best special effects. So long, Machete is a great achievement this year, so poor in great movies. It stands for a great action movie, trying to establish an icon for the future.

We all know films are more exciting and exhilirating when watching them in the theatre (i.e. more immersive). The simple answer of course as to why our viewing experiences are better in theatres than at home has to do with the limitations of our media to view it at home (TV's, blu ray playes, home theatre systems, etc.). With the advancements of todays technologies in televisions now days such as high resolution TVs (4k's and beyond), improved media formats (blu ray, 4k UHD) and frame rate manipulation (24P vs 60P) etc., among many other features, this has brought us closer than we've ever been to being able to match theatre qualities that ultimately give us that same immersive experience. Unfortunately some new features of todays tech can actually hurt the viewing experience as well. Your setup is going to be vital to how you experience a film and ultimately what you thougt of it. You may be telling yourself ""well duh, everyone knows that, so whats your point?"" The point I'm trying to make is that not everyone knows this and may have an improper setup when writing a reviews on a film. This is especially concerning to me when I see reviews suggesting films were ""bad,"" ""outdated,"" or ""what were they thinking, people actually thought this was good."" Case in point, PLEASE, make sure you have the proper settings when viewing films before making a review on it as it can most certainly effect what you thought of it.I am a film lover and nothing brings me more satisfaction than to see others experience that same level joy as I do. Conversely, nothing upsets me more than to see a good film get torn to shreds due to an inadequate setup. So instead of giving you my 2 cent review of a film, since there are so many good reviewers out there already, I will simply rate the film and state whether I thought it was good, bad, ok or excellent and tell you how I watched it. Obviously settings are subjectable to each setup and individual perspective and I am in no way shape or form suggesting that my way is the only correct way but rather this is how I enjoyed it and you might like it that way too.",Machete

It seems like the director has other things on his mind or maybe the script was poorly written. There are several soft (out of focus shots) and a few compositions that make this film look amateur. Some directors are only capable of making one type of film and they do it over and over. The fact that they made a sequel is a sad commentary on the film industry or the powers that be.

It's gory, but not gory enough. The actors are having fun, but not having enough fun. Even though the movie is only 1 hour and 45 minutes long, it felt like it was about 10 minutes too long. On the plus side, the movie LOOKED cool. Danny Trejo looked bad-ass, and Michelle Rodriquez - WOW - She looked fantastic. Jessica Alba though has a really awkward scene where she stands on a car to rally some people together. It just doesn't work. It felt weak. It felt like some 2nd or 3rd unit director was afraid to ask Alba for better acting. Probably one of the actors having the most fun (or was the most fun to see) was Tom Savini. Savini is essentially playing the same guy he always plays, but so what. It's what you come to expect. He seems like a pretty solid actor though so it would be nice to see him do more in the future.

The character Machete has no charisma or appeal, and the only good actor in it has way too small of a role (Cheech Marin). Steven Segal looks like a bloated pig in it, and sucks as an actor, as always. Don Johnson and DeNiro were decent, but had limited roles. Alba is hot, but offers little else, and doesn't show enough skin to make it worth watching just to look at her. Lindsay Lohan kinda shows her boobs, but not really. Lots of somewhat big names in it, but the movie is just so horribly done that not even DeNiro can save it.I also didn't care for the pro-immigrant stance, and how it made whitey out to be such a terrible person and the illegals the poor innocent victims.

Well about the movie the only thing i liked was making Danny Trejo the ""hero"", I was amazed to find out he is 66, and is a shame he is so old, he might not be a great actor but he doesn't need to be, he has the rugged look and attitude and thats halfway for a great character. Apart from that, and the appearance of ""cheech"" (his brother), the movie is a waste of time. Ridiculous gore scenes, heads being cut off like vegetables (and other parts of the body), scenes that make no sense, a plot that makes no sense, has no logic and shows no intelligence from the writers (despite touching an interesting subject) and I could go on and on pointing the flaws all day but everybody has eyes to watch them carefully.So Ill just say the movie is not a complete waste of time, a few good laughs, but is overall a cheap taste, cheap execution, seems like a parody and I don't think it intends to be a parody. Is not funny, is not serious, is not deep, is not dramatic, romantic nor intelligent, and for sure it ain't scary, so I don't understand what this movie intends to be besides mediocre. And I also don't understand what is De Niro doing here.",Machete

If you were a big fan of the grindhouse movies, specifically planet terror you will for sure enjoy this movie, it was very similar and filmed in the same style. The actors in the movie were a big part of why the movie was so entertaining; Steven Stegal, Rober De Niro, and Lindsey Lohan were a pretty hilarious contribution to the movie. The plot was very entertaining and there did not seem to be any slow parts of the movie, the movie kept the entire theatre laughing, and when it added the entire theatre seemed very please with everything they just saw.

Danny, though pretty old for a lead-role (he's currently 66) gave his best and his performance is tremendous.Robert DeNiro and Steven Seagal, as usual stole the show with their intense screen presence. Jessica Alba does an excellent job. Michelle Rodriquez is hot! Lindsay shines in a cameo. And yes, there's lot of gore and racist comments, but that doesn't drastically deviate you from the main story line (unless you take those too personally...lol)I won't say this is as good as Robert's signature work 'Sin City', but it's definitely worth a watch.",Machete

It is way over the top -- not as much as Pulp Fiction, but close enough. I think it was not mean to be taken seriously. I was laughing about half way through it. Despite some fairly well-known actors and a skilled director, the script and acting were like a parody of action/revenge films. Even the fine acting skills of Robert De Niro succumbed, although he probably did it on purpose. I honestly think they tried to make a bad movie... casting Lindsay Lohan and Steven Seagal was a clue, and adding Don Johnson just proves it.",Machete

Whites stupidly tolerated this film and didn't acknowledge the overt racism directed toward them most likely out of fear of being branded racists themselves. The film culminates in a battle scene BETWEEN two racial groups. It wasn't a battle between nations that happen to be of different ethnicities, this was a race-battle. Whites on one side and Latinos on the other. This is not what people need. Michelle Rodriguez talks about ""your people"" to Jessica Alba, and yet if you have two white people saying the same thing, they might as well be wearing Klan hoods. Does ANYBODY notice this? I know this film was supposed to be tongue-in-cheek. I get it. I also understand a lot more what Robert Rodriguez thinks about white people as a whole. I'll be sure to miss his next film.",Machete

Otherwise, the recipe used here worked well for Grindhouse but there is a point when too much nonsense is exactly that: too much nonsense! Steven Seagal only has about 4-5 words in Spanish the entire film (he is supposed to be Mexican) and is not capable of delivering the right accent for just that much. Is that the best that Jessica Alba can do as far as acting?! There is a reason why Danny Trejo only had thus far secondary roles in films: he is not a real actor. And by that I mean he is THAT BAD! Too much bad acting, too much nonsense with the story... hot chicks, that's the only good thing in this film. And only Michelle Rodriguez delivered in both hotness and acting.",Machete
289,movieman1947,awesome,8,6 September 2010,"Machete has a great many things going for it: good acting, story and scoring. The music added a lot of flavor to the scenes, and gave it a different kind of feel. The acting all around was great Steven Seagal as his first out right villain role was decent. Danny Trejo who is not often a lead actor really showed what he can do given the opportunity, he made the role, and movie I can really not see anyone else playing it.Robert DeNiro was cool in this movie but kind of seemed like he wasn't trying all that hard to give the role much depth. The movie has added some comedy without over doing and the action was over the top but also within the bounds the movie created with its early life in grindhouse. Machete has an artistic view and a movie that is fun to see as well as being a solid movie. Bottom line if your a fan of the genre go see Machete you will not be disappointed.",Machete
290,liammofo-816-651953,Over the top brilliance,10,11 March 2011,"Machete is one of those films that you know what to expect before you go in. It is understood that this is an exploitation flick, which will have excessive violence, sex and nudity. What pleased me most about this film, that as well as that (which should be minimal expectation before going in), it has a well told cohesive story and some real power house acting. I am a big fan of Rodriguez's earlier film, 'Desperado,' and Machete is similar to that; except where Desperado took itself seriously, this film has its tongue firmly in cheek and from this you get a lot of the humour - and it works. From start, all the way through to the finish, there is something happening that keeps you glued to the screen. Perfect to watch in a group, especially if some of them have a low attention span. Limits have been pushed and I love it. It is not excessive violence for random excessive violence sake; it's been thought about and works extremely well in regard to the story and tone of the film. I would describe 'Planet Terror' as a practice for what Rodriguez wanted that didn't quite deliver and Machete as the masterpiece - that delivers on all cylinders. I cannot recommend this film enough as a riotous laugh out loud, violent and engaging experience.",Machete
291,byhring2,One Bad ('Bad' As in 'Good') Western,6,18 January 2011,"This movie got right everything it was going for, and probably then some. It was a bit of a (don't call it a) come-back flick for Rodriguez, who made a strong directorial showing with this surprisingly star studded crew. It was violent, fast paced, humorous, and...well, I guess I'd to have to say...downright bada**. Playing on the number of cliché situations that exist in action movies that actually take themselves serious, Machete finds a way to weave all that is usually bad into something good. It has Western themes and and a plot which focuses on ethnic issues that actually divide North and Central America citizens. It is highly satirized, but its story focuses on a hypothetical example of what could happen because of poor immigration laws, so it even has educational value (I'm just joking, it is extremely violent. I wouldn't recommended letting your kids watch).As long as your going into the movie knowing what it is, then you're going to at least enjoy some of it. Go 'head, give it a watch.

292,ANewLeaf,"Hit the nail on the head, being a bad B-Movie.",6,19 September 2010,"It is hard to rate a movie, whose intention is to have bad camera work, a poor hashed together plot meant to move from one violent scene to the next, canned acting performances, and the slew of other touches this movie has to make it seem one of the lowest grade of movies from the 1970's heyday of B-Movies.They succeed. The acting is characterized and goofy, the action scenes are overblown and the effects look as fake as some of the worst of the gener, the plot is both simple and yet a mess. But how does one rate it? How would they have failed? Accidentally made the movie too good? Accidentally added some better dialogue, a better plot, better acting? This is a movie they could do no wrong in, anything that is done terribly can be wrote off as part of the whole experience.One of the main problems though when comparing this to a true B-Movie is that the actual B-Movies did not ""try"" to be bad, they just were. One could do the exact same thing Machete did with say, the Japanese Godzilla movies. Those movies are brutal, but they are so bad they are good. But if one were to try now to recreate that feel? Sorry but there are few chances to go see that double feature at a drive-in with the dancing hotdog doing a flip into the bun at half time singing ""lets all go to the lobby"". Sneaking 4 friends into the thing in the trunk of your giant 1974 Chevy with a trunk the size of a small swimming pool to save the $1.50 admission and having the place on a Friday or Saturday night be full of teenagers half of whom you know from your school or the other schools in the neighborhoods.The world has gone past the point where movies like the old B-Movies work. And Machete is not a B-movie, it is a mainstream movie in B-Movie clothing. It did not work on either front. It did not make me feel like a young kid back in the day watching a true B-Movie, and it did not feel at all like watching a good flick in the theater either.",Machete

Machete keeps essentially the same style as Planet Terror, but the major difference is that most of the fun you get out Machete are ONLY the quick gruesome kills and the intentional corny dialogue; Planet Terror delivered a lot more amusement for me because underneath the action and intentional cheesiness, it actually had a good zombie story with really interesting characters. In Machete, I had absolutely no sympathy or connection w/any of them; Danny Trejo didn't even have a lot of lines in the movie, you're really just there to watch him to kill the bad guys (and maybe for some immature nudity). I was really looking toward films paying homage to the grindhouse movies, but this was a real disappointment compared to the fun I had in Planet Terror. If you just want to have a good old dumb time w/your friends, you'll have plenty of laughs in this movie. But really, this could have had a lot more intensity and thrills; instead it chose to remain corny from start to finish.PS - It was PAINFUL to hear several of the actors say Spanish words so badly! I know most of it was intentional and silly, but it just got extremely annoying for me to bear - they just overkilled it.",Machete

297,JimmyMcCool,The human intestine is 60 foot long,7,3 June 2011,"This is a competent cheesy action film done in the style of a bad movie set in the Texas/Mexico border directed and written by Robert Rodriguez. It stars Rodriguez regular, Danny Trejo in his first leading role, as ex Mexican Federale Machete, a hard as nails tough guy who is hired by suave business man, Michael Booth, performed by Jeff Fahey, to assassinate right wing Senator John Mclaughlin, played by Robert Deniro. Mclaughlin is in the process of a re-election campaign and his main policy is illegal immigrants; which he is going to sort by building a massive electric fence across the border. Did I mention he has his own vigilante mob led by Miama Vice star Don Johnson? Well, he does and they police the border and execute anyone who tries to cross, even Senator Mclaughlin likes get involved in the killing, which annoys underground revolutionary faction the network; led by Michelle Rodriguez from her Taco truck who is under surveillance by immigration officer, Jessica Alba. Booth, tells Machete he needs the Senator dead because if Mclaughlin builds that fence it's going to upset his access to cheap labour. However, Machete is double crossed and is being used to help the Senator get more popularity. And that sets up the plot.There are some decent action scenes, nothing too special, they tend to be more humorous than exciting, Machete never ever really has any major problems dispatching the bad guys, racking up a body count Arnie would be jealous of. The acting is very tongue in cheek, it doesn't take itself too seriously and there is some very nice eye candy on display in the form of Jessica Alba, Michelle Rodriguez and Lindsay Lohan; their acting might not be great, but they are real easy on the eye. Although Machete doesn't have a huge back story (he was a former Fed whose wife was murdered by Steven Seagal), Danny Trejo's craggy scarred face tells the story for him. Apparently Trejo used to be a child drug addict and has served time in prison for drug and robbery offenses. He became a boxing champ behind bars too. Afterwards he became rehabilitated, then an actor; Trejo's real life back story is actually more interesting than Machetes, a hard man in real life as well as on camera.All in all, a well paced action movie with cheesy one liners, beautiful woman and a cast of fine actors who clearly had a fun time making this film. It's main problem is there is no suspense, it's fairly obvious the good guys are going to win; there's a scene where Machete casually puts down his coffee and continues eating his snack while fighting a thug which sums up his attitude to what's going on around him. There's also a lot of cgi gore which can look a bit fake at times. But it is what it is, a well financed deliberate bad movie which is actually really fun to watch with a few beers and some friends. Pure entertainment - 3.5/5",Machete

Tough guy's revenge against the villain who took away X's life. Blahblahblah. But the end result here is just brilliant.Having said all that there is 1 thing i think could have been done better. Trejos character is pretty much a monkey with few lines and generally portrayed as a bit dumb. I can't help thinking he could have pulled off a slightly more interesting character. I totally realize he's supposed to be old school muscles and pulls that off well, but it's like they thought ""hey this is going to be cheese with cheese on so don't bother"".That is not to say he's bad, I just can't help thinking there was a bit of potential that went unexplored.

299,kac-12,Mexploitation and Entertainment at Its Best,10,25 August 2010,"MACHETE, a Robert Rodriguez film, starring Danny Trejo, Jessica Alba,  Michelle Rodriguez, Jeff Fahey, Robert DeNiro, Steven Seagal, Lindsay  Lohan, Tom Savini, Cheech Marin, and Don Johnson. Soak that in for a  moment.  The story for Machete, as outlandish as it is, goes something like  this: He looked like just another day laborer from the hood, and the  perfect scapegoat for a corrupt political assassination. But he turned  out to be MACHETE, a legendary ex-Federale with a deadly attitude and  the skills to match. Left for dead after attempting to go against the  notorious Mexican drug kingpin Torrez, Steven Seagal, Machete has  escaped to Texas. But what he finds is a web of corruption and betrayal  that leaves a bullet in a senator, Robert DeNiro, and Machete a wanted  man. Machete sets out to clear his name and expose this conspiracy, but  he does it. The MACHETE way. What ensues is a wildly creative tale of  carnage, vengeance, and a Mexican Revolution. You might have been  familiar with this film since 2007, since a fake trailer for Machete  was shown in the ambitious double feature event Grindhouse that is now  regarded as legendary trailer. Well, now you have your entire film  version.  Danny Trejo is finally getting his due here. Always the most bad-ass in  his film appearances, he's never had much of a leading role, except for  now. He is fantastic as Machete, and at the current age of 66, the  action he does is pretty phenomenal. Machete is the type of character  that always gets the one-up on the bad guys and the love of the ladies,  and you can just sense that Trejo is loving every moment of it.  Luckily, so are we.  Machete is a film chock-full of truly schmaltzy performances from every  member of the cast. The big difference here is that the schmaltz is  intentional. The villains of this movie are so appropriately evil and  murderous, with a samurai sword wielding Steven Seagal, in his first  villainous role, simply stealing the show as Torrez. Yes, I just said  that Steven Seagal stole the show over a hilarious politically  incorrect politician Robert DeNiro, a sleazy rogue businessman Jeff  Fahey, and a sinister Mexican shooting Don Johnson. You really want to  see these foes get what they deserve. Bonus points if you spot Quentin  Tarantino in a blink and you miss it cameo! With these villains, and  their humorous henchmen, Machete also has his own connections and  compadres. Jessica Alba is, believe it or not, the main love interest  to Machete and some of her deliveries are so cringe-inducing, it's  squirm-worthy. Yet, she's alright! There's also Michelle Rodriguez as  Luz, a rather attractive taco truck lady who may have a secret identity  as a Mexican patriot who plays it just fine. But it's Padre, Machete's  brother, played by Cheech Marin, whose sequences in the film are some  of the very best. He's hysterical and can handle dual shotguns like  nobody else. And yes, Lindsay Lohan is in this and she's not half-bad  for the little things she has to do. When she's not nude, she's dressed  up as a pretty nifty revolver packing nun, but she doesn't pack that  much of a punch.  Machete is a film that embodies all of the facets a 1970s  blaxploitation film would have, but with the Hispanic culture. This is  Mexploitation, with a resonant grindhouse feeling, complete with film  reel scratches and fake political ads. But the violence and action in  this is so extraordinary and unapologetically gruesome, with the  extremity of it all not being taken seriously at all. The things they  do in this film, guaranteed you haven't seen most of them ever done  before. Corkscrews, high-heels, weed-whackers, and, of course,  machetes, are only a very small listing of all the tools and weapons  used to dispatch characters in Machete. It's over the top, absolutely  ridiculous scenes that pop up every five minutes and make for a joyous  film experience. There are too many be-headings, blood-splattering  gunshots, and limb removals to count. Don't even get me started on the  stabbings. To add the cherry on top, Machete is shot perfectly,  fluidly, and inventively.  Machete is completely, for lack of a better term, over the top, has a  fitting heavy and groovy soundtrack, and never holds back on the gore.  The dialogue is hokey and full of Mexican puns, but it knows this.  Machete loves to poke fun at itself and its ridiculous concepts, with  characters questioning certain events in the movie, realizations that  everything is insane, and an awesome B-movie touch that graces the  opening of the end credits. Machete is Robert Rodriguez's most  enjoyable and best film to date. It's so fun, so amazing, and actually  provides a sort of a social political message, now with racial  profiling and immigration being a controversial Americana topic. It's  why Machete is such a great film for the times, and will be looked upon  as one of the culturally relevant films of the last couple years I'm  as shocked as you are.  Machete is the best action film of 2010 and is certainly one of the  best of the year. It's fantastic entertainment that I oh so highly  recommend you watch. Machete es...... Yes, excelente.",Machete

The movie plays out exactly as if the trailer was a full movie, which it basically is now. From the first few minutes when the naked female character pulls a cellphone from her private area i knew i was in for a ride. Danny Trejo is at his best here, showing if the role is tailored to him he can carry an action movie as a lead role. Also you have to remember Danny Trejo is 66 years old, which makes it amazing in itself that he can do these kinds of films. The adding of other big names like Jessica Alba, Michelle Rodriguez, Robert De Niro, Don Johnson, Steven Seagal, Jeff Fahey just helped even more. In the end you get a great entertaining film, that if viewed in the right mindset, should not disappoint. I myself was completely satisfied with the film. Loved the fact Lindsay Lohan had to play a role close to her true life she is living, must be getting hard to get roles if you have to basically exploit yourself just to join some real names on screen.

I'm struggling to find anything good to say about it, but frankly it so uninspired I can't even be bother to write any more about it.Oh, good God, I'm got to write ten lines about this drivel.

303,steve-613-659125,Captain Planet meets a Junior High diary,3,4 September 2010,"Interesting to see all the boilerplate 8-10 ratings before the film came out. Typical WhollyOdd: front-loading IMDb with praise to raise a film's rating and coax people to see it.This is one of those films that combines a half-baked political message with a thin pretense of story so that the filmmakers can bask in the glow of their supporters' praise while claiming ""it's just a movie"" when opponents point out the glaring falsehoods, rationalizations, dropped contexts and hyperbole. Gutless and petulant, it reminded me of Captain Planet, in which evil men set out to destroy for destruction's sake with no perceptible gain for their actions.On the other hand, the script had to have been adapted from the diary of an 11-year-old girl throwing a tantrum because she didn't make the cheerleading squad, so petty and self-pitying as it is.In a nutshell: ALL opposition to illegal immigration is based solely--that's right, there are NO other reasons--on sourceless hatred of Mexicans. That's it. The complex and far-reaching ethical issues, financial realities, social architecture, et. al. are reduced to ""they don't like me!"" Nothing about legitimate support for legal immigration, nobody claiming anchor babies, ZERO about the restrictive and racist policies of Mexican immigration... nada. Again, it's like an overlong and hyper-violent episode of Captain Planet written by a rejected tweenager.The synopsis is something about a betrayed cop, but that's not the real story. Not that it matters, but the ""plot"" is a plan to restrict access to the US by electrified border fence which enjoys support from universally racist Texas citizens. But it's designed with strategically placed access points so the personal aide of a politician who opposes illegal immigration can get drug mules through. This would be pertinent if it weren't lost in the cloying miasma of race pimping.Said politician makes campaign commercials and speeches straight out of the Leni Riefenstahl handbook, directly comparing Mexicans to roaches and maggots, repeatedly referring to them as terrorists (personally, I **don't know a single human being** who would remain in a room with, much less support, such a piece of crap). Happily, he magically realizes the error of his ways in a last-minute transition to Mexican identity (via poncho and hat, wouldn't it be great if that's all it took to change nationalities?) before he's gunned down by his daughter, and later by the very rednecks he's been aiding--who don't recognize his face in bright, revealing floodlight. Thus completes the adolescent fantasy of revenge, humiliation, capitulation, forgiveness--but he's still murdered by his own kind.In the film, Mexicans are victims: virtuous, beloved of family, and utterly blameless across the board. They have no significant faults, but are incessantly harassed for existing.The biggest obstacle to their integration as productive members of society is the United States' refusal to treat them like human beings. At worst, a priest carries guns and kills, but only in self-defense before he's tortured and murdered, nailed to a cross for protecting his people against the evil whites. Plenty of symbolism there.Whites are--let's see if I can remember it all--illiterate, uneducated, prone to vomiting at the sight of blood, hypocrites, sacrilegious, happy to shoot pregnant women and teenage boys in cold blood for a snuff video, unable to accept differences of opinion within their own communities, confused about their own beliefs, in the mood for sex with their own strung-out daughters (both mom *and* dad, no less), happy to torture and kill inside a church, and apparently the true benefactors of Mexican drug cartels.Blacks and Asians happily serve whites to the detriment of their fellow minorities. Because they dislike Mexicans, too. Admittedly, that's the part that's NOT Captain Planet.On the other hand, Michelle Rodriguez looks great with her pants almost falling off, even as she slaughters those other-than-la-raza.And there will be sequels!",Machete

The violence was overwhelming, and the writing was cornily witty. Pretty good performances all around from Alba, Trejo, DeNiro, Seagal, Lohan and many a more. Great entertainment, perfect to sit down with some buddies on a Saturday night and have a good laugh.No doubt in my mind this will do well in the box office, and well, not so well with the critics.

307,dejahnsalter1,"Trejo is A Bad, Bad Man",8,28 December 2013,"This movie is stupid. That's how I'm starting my review. It's stupid.....it's also hilarious, extremely violent and subtly intelligent. Every thing about this movie screams EXPLOITATION. From the smooth, casually edited in sex scenes to the extreme violence and gore; Machete nails everything tasteless perfectly. I just love the style of this film; it looks like some old 70s cop show. Combine this with purposefully nonsensical set-pieces, campy acting, chop and paste editing and a horrendously structured plot and BAM! you have the ""don't give a crap"", offensive prowess possessed only by the likes of Machete. Danny Trejo, by the way, is freaking amazing in this film. Even though he doesn't really say much. Which, just makes him cooler, in the long run. In the midst of all Machete's visceral, derogatory illustriousness, however, there are some flaws. The pacing is a little too slow and the middle drags and drags for a bit...In fact, the middle kind of takes away from the thunder of Danny's introduction. The plot is also incoherent and ludicrous...However, I'm pretty such this was on purpose (all Machete's great merits pretty much distract from the plot anyways) Despite these flaws, Machete is ultimately an intelligent and biting satire on southern immigration politics and its opposing attitudes . Overall, this film was great and I just pray, pray that Machete Kills Again rekindles its flame (Because Machete Kills Was absolutely boring and terrible)PS.

It has some of the worst acting and/or story. The plot kinda falls apart and goes in several directions. There's the revenge for the killing of the family. There's the corrupt politician who's being double crossed by his adviser who is being double crossed by somebody else. The vigilantes have an on going war with the underground network of illegals crossing the border, with both sides planning armed to the teeth. I know it's only a movie, but when a priest is killed in a church in real life it's gonna get more then a casual mention on the local news, not in this movie. The worst of all though is the political message about immigration! It seems the movie is trying to make me feel bad about being white! It's trying to show how unfair we, as Americans, are to the Mexican immigrants who only want to come to America to work.I really think this movie was made by and for bleeding heart liberals.",Machete

Fortunately, Robert Rodriguez listened to these claims and fulfilled the wishes of the fans. Through this film, he re- visits (again) the exploitation flicks of the 70's, complete with gratuitous bloody violence, nudity and completely over-the-top scenes. From Machete mounting a minigun onto a motorcycle, to using a man's intestine as a rappel, ""Machete"" delivers with gore, so-bad-it's-great acting, corny one-liners, hilarious tongue-in-cheek humor, and sexy women.The only weak part of the film is some choppy acting by Lindsay Lohan, but she's only in it for about four minutes. Overall, if you want a fantastic boy's night out which you will remember for many years to come go watch ""Machete"" right now!",Machete
311,leantom-2,"Mr. Rodriguez, you owe me $8.00.",2,4 September 2010,"There are a number of great Mexploitation films. ""El Mariachi,"" ""Desperado"" and ""Once Upon a Time in Mexico"" all come to mind. Not only were those films action-packed and entertaining, but they contained good plots which one could follow without losing interest.Then, there's ""Machete."" I'll keep things honest, seeing as (apparently) the only submitted reviews were done by film crew members.The movie starts out well. In the first scene, Machete (and his partner, who dies almost immediately) storms into a drug cartel, wreaking havoc against armed goons with nothing but his (get ready) machete. He kills about a dozen people, rescuing a naked female hostage in the process. However, as they're leaving the cartel hideout, she betrays Machete to the cartel's leader, a man named Torrez (played by Steven Seagal). Machete being subdued, Torrez tortures Machete but decides not to kill him. Instead, he kills Machete's wife and child and leaves Machete alive so that he can suffer for the rest of his life.Yes, it's simple, but the movie actually looked quite good up until this point. Then, the nightmare began.Rather than construct a decent story and continue with the main plot (i.e., a man with nothing to lose trying to avenge the deaths of his wife and child), the movie veers off into a tirade of politicizations and hate-mongering. It portrays white conservatives (get ready for some originality) as racist red-necks who are hell-bent on killing Mexicans for sheer enjoyment. It even shows a U.S. Senator (played by Robert De Niro) killing a pregnant illegal alien and her spouse, saying afterward, ""My supporters would love this"" (paraphrase).(Yes, Hollywood, people are not against illegal immigration because it destroys the Rule of Law, hurts the economy, increases unemployment, increases violent crime, puts financial burdens on tax-payers, etc. - it's because they hate Hispanics).Before continuing, I just want to mention that the writer of this review is the product of a Hispanic father. OK, here we go.As already mentioned, after the opening sequence, the movie becomes overtly political. The aforementioned senator (played by De Niro) is seen campaigning for re-election, his main political platform being the construction of a border-fence designed to keep out illegal aliens (the horror!). However, many people in power are against this, and they hire Machete (now a day-laborer) to assassinate the senator. Of course, as indicated by the coming attractions, Machete is betrayed by the very people who hire him, and it is revealed that they are, in fact, working for the very cartel leader who killed Machete's family (what a startling coincidence!). It turns out that Machete was only hired to arouse public sympathy for the senator and increase the public's demand for a border fence (which Torrez, the cartel leader who killed Machete's family, wants, given that then he can control the drug trade between the Mexican-U.S. border).The story gets very boring, with immigration politics ascending into the forefront. The action slows down to a grinding halt, and the story devolves into simple political platitudes (check out Jessica Alba's call for a race-war near the end of the movie, demanding that illegal immigrants incite violence in order to acquire citizenship).In conclusion, this movie sucks. Mr. Rodriguez, I want my money back.",Machete
312,kittycatcat-586-666618,I'm forced myself through the end of this mess,2,3 October 2010,"And I am still wondering why have I done this to myself? This is a typical incarnation of Rodriguez idea of fun and this film is far from funny. It's demonstratively low production (again like all of his movies) without any continuity in plot and it painfully mixes extra bad acting (I'd say cheesy acting) with some decent actors (well, at least not all of them were to my liking). I'd better not see them on this wrong side of the fence. This is not entertaining and this is not amusing. My thoughts are that the director of this little confusion cannot make anything better than a parody to a B-movie. Most of B-movies will look like something really good against Machete. For example, the bad horror flick can make you laugh. This one kept me praying to end the torture. Some can spot a number of similarities between Rodriguez and Tarantino but the main difference between them is that Tarantino can cast seriously but Rodriguez cannot cast at all. I told myself after watching Planet Terror that I will never watch anything from him again and... Ah... Jeez... Me stupefying meself. On the positive note I think he's improving. That Planet Terror was wa-a-ay over the top for me.p.s. Noting the high user score here: aren't you tired of watching this pointless mess again and again guys? Don't you have the mind of your own?

313,xxdeliverancexx,Good movie,8,10 September 2010,"I thought Robert Rodriguez did a great job making this movie. Granted it doesn't include a lot of the scenes that were in the original preview, but it didn't have to. He picked up where the preview left off brilliantly. I have to say that it was everything I thought it would be. I think he hit pretty close to home with the plot concerning what is going on in the world (especially our nation)concerning our border and it's up-keep. It was obviously a sprinkling of his opinion concerning the matter. Danny Trejo did a good job playing as Machete. Of course, who else but him? I don't think many people would have watched it if someone else were to play the part. It was pretty much Trejo or bust when it came to this particular title. What's with the few movies Trejo has done this year of a ""B"" nature? I guess actors need money just like anyone else and aspiring producers and directors need well- renowned actors to play the parts for them. I definitely believe that Trejo made up for any of his short-comings this year with this movie. I am confident enough to give it an 8 of 10.",Machete

Nowhere could I find the real plot on this movie, not even here. This movie is not about REVENGE, it's about how all illegal immigrants are somehow victims of the U.S. ""system"" of immigration. Also that all Americans (especially Texans, which I am not, are racist bigots that want to kill all illegals, even pregnant ones). This movie ended up disgusting me (considering). I will sum up this movie in a quote from this movie ""We didn't cross the border, the border crossed us!""....WTF? Oh and buy the way, that quote is from someone that is in the movie an I.C.E. agent.

Jessica Alba does what she does best, its all about seduction. Cheech Marin is great. I don't talk about Lindsay Lohan because she is not an actress.

So what if mister Rodriguez makes movies with Tarantino? Even these guys are allowed to make mistakes? Why should you allow them to think that they are making good movies all the time? Why, people, WHY? The mistakes are BIG, very big. (robert De niro shoots Jeff Fahey in the chest with a ... red paint ball ... What? Those are very stupid special effects.

If not a genius, at least the God of all warriors, right?"" ...So that's how they've came up with that kind of ending for mister Seagal. I have a question: How do you kill a mean Mexican like Dany Trejo? You can't ...He's more powerful and resistant to bullets and explosions than The Punisher! Another question: How do you create an even more hotter Michelle Rodriguez? You just shoot her in the head ... so that the bullet would hit her eye. And ...a rope out of an intestine? Come on people! I really think that mister Robert Rodriguez should do a couple of super-hero movies. He's just good at making every main character of his untouchable ...the Superman kind ...not the Van Damme kind!!!

318,oligeir,The Plot Thickens..,4,21 October 2010,"I enjoyed the Machete 2007 trailer and was expecting the film to be an entertaining ride full of humor and good action. Watching the movie I noticed I did not laugh out loud very often, maybe (I thought) it's missing the hilarious voice over from the trailer.For an action film I didn't find the action itself to be very exciting, sure there's plenty of gore and slashing but it wasn't anything I hadn't seen before. I was expecting the action to be a lot cooler too. Some of the action scenes looked as if they hadn't been rehearsed properly and came across as flat. If it's because they were trying to make it look like the 70's movies then they should have gone a step further with it.I found all the Jessica Alba and Michelle Rodriguez plot slow the movie down. I would've thought seeing his wife killed would have been motivation enough for Machete to go off on a killing spree. No he decided to look for construction or gardening work instead..The showdown with Torrez was a bit of a let down. Why did Torrez commit suicide instead of trying to finish off Machete?? He said that even fatally wounded he could still take Machete out. So why on earth didn't he go for it?? Maybe nobody gets to kill Steven Seagal but Steven Seagal himself ;) After all that's why I enjoy his characters so much, they're indestructible and almost untouchable.What I wanted from this film was to see Machete go down a one way street of over the top hilarious revenge killings, staying ruthless and relentless until the end (preferebly with the voice over for extra fun) The best thing about Machete for me was seeing Jeff Fahey, Steven Seagal and Don Johnson in a big budget (was the budget big? it didn't look very big) film and hopefully the success of this film will help to get them better roles in the near future.I thought Jeff Fahey stole the show and was great fun to watch. Don Johnson too. And even Robert De Niro who I haven't been too impressed with for the past years was quite good as Senator McLaughlin. The Senator's campaign ads were really funny.For me it was worth watching because of Fahey, Seagal, Johnson and De Niro.",Machete

It is a huge middle finger to conservatives and or christians, or both. I understand the point of this movie is to be brutal and excessively gory, however this film goes too far. It is just not entertaining. I don't believe that a whole movie should be a political message either way its leaning unless it is a religious or political movie. This movie could have done without the un- intelligent use of the illegal immigration problem, they are totally slanted and it makes the movie feel like you get it shoved down your throat.

I mean, from the trailer, i felt it has too clichéd to be taken up as a movie by either Tarantino or Rodriguez. But the movie was different from what I expected fro the trailer. Yes it had all those 'cliche' element from that trailer, but it had an interesting backdrop. It was about the 'illegal' Mexican immigrants in US, their fight for survival, the Dirty politics and Drug mafia playing their parts all told in an interesting way by one of the masters of sarcasm.

321,walkerazcarpenter,Machete 2010 - Danny Trejo,6,5 February 2011,"The movie's cast was great from male roles by Robert Deniro and Danny Trejo and females like Jessica Alba and Lindsay Lohan. That is pretty much where the fun ended for me. I was so happy to see Danny Trejo get a lead role in a movie with this male crew: Robert De Niro, Steven Seagal, Cheech Marin, Jeff Fahey, and Don Johnson that it made me sad to have to give this review, but I have to be honest. The cast is pretty much where my delight for ""Machete 2010"" ended. There were cheesecake scenes with women like Lindsay Lohan, Jessica Alba, and Michelle Rodriguez. No amount of bare breasts, no matter how appealing, or not even with a plethora of great acting could save the script. The cinematography was good, the scene production was good, stunts were good, but not only was the premise lacking, the lines sounded like someone tried to write the script in a hurry. The Mexican American stereotypes were so boldly offensive that they were almost humorous. The Machete character was an unusual, knife wielding ""Macho Samarai Style"" of action figure. (How many movies are going to be made showing knives, swords, or machetes being superior to automatic weapons can we take?) The big name cast by itself will probably get a decent box office draw but when it comes to cheesy, that would be the only thing that this movie was ""top of the line"" at. In one scene alone, the individual lines were nothing more than exclamations that were predictable and led to a cornball fight scene. When it came to the weaponry or vehicles, the story became completely unrealistic. Danny Trejo should stick to reading the scripts previous to taking on a role. His part in most other movies like ""Heat"" or ""Con Air"" were far better. This may have been part of a back lot deal which included future good movies with better scripts, I don't know. It was definitely not a movie that anyone involved in it will brag about to to anyone they hope to impress.",Machete

I see 2 to 3 theatrical movies per week, and Machete is hands down my pick for Best Movie of the Year. Studios have forgotten how to make a fun movie. Apparently Robert Rodriguez has not. He and his team of filmmakers seem to grasp like no other studio what actually made the old grindhouse flics of yesterday so fun to watch. We get humor without a side-dish of mushy sentimentality. We get action that is unapologetically over the top. It is also a brilliant move to create a Latino hero like Machete. I hope to see the character return again and again in the future. Casting could not have been more perfect. I seriously doubt that anyone other than Danny Trejo could have brought the character of Machete to life in such a brilliant way. I was also happy to see that this movie didn't subject itself to the awful trend of trying to make every movie PG or PG-13. I am an adult and I want to see more movies made for adults! Thank you Machete for bringing on the R rating! I will definitely be seeing this movie again this weekend in one of the local Alamo theatres.

323,dcracing,"Rock'em, Sock'em, Stab'em Gore drawback to the Cheesy B Movies of the Past w/lots of Action!",9,15 September 2010,"This movie is surprisingly great for Danny's first time out as a lead. I did not expect this casting but with a supporting co-cast of Jessica Alba and Michelle Rodriguez, Rodriguez made it all work perfectly. Think of how they made Keanu Reeves look good in Matrix for example as a perfect fit for the role. Cinematogrphy is great considering the budget and fits the 70's BMovie drawback of the past look. Don't get this wrong, if you're looking for a really serious movie, it probably be a 5 or 6, but a lot of the BMovie comedic gore, with LOTS of Non-stop Action and Violence, a few-unbelievably unrealistic of some parts are absolutely HILARIOUS! This movie actually has a message too. I would almost give this movie a 10 if you saw it as a full-blown comedy or even horror/comedy to a certain level.Michelle Rodriguez and Lindsay Lohan actually shine over Jessica Alba because of the nature of their ""badass"" type character, as Jessica has to play ""Goodie-Two-Shoes"" here, but just her presence in this movie is great to see. Obviously DeNiro, Don Johnson and even Steven Segal nail their parts right on its head. You will be surprised by Lindsay Lohan's redemption as a legitimate actress with her cameo. Overall, Rodriguez has pumped out another hit in my mind. I'm a bit surprised by the low sales (although they broke even), but I'm guessing it's too gory or something for some people.

324,Sexy_Metalhead,Dripping and Oozing With Unspeakable Hate,2,9 September 2010,"I still remember seeing Grindhouse and how I and the audience roared in approval to the fake trailer of Machete. It had it all and felt just like a total B-Movie, I loved it. ""They should make that into a movie."" I remember saying. Well, they did......yes they did.I had high hopes as I arrived in the theater expecting a total B-Movie, leave my brain at the door and have at it. What I got was something completely different. Machete is indeed a revenge movie as the fake trailer entailed, but this is not the point of this.Sure, we get to finally see the awesome tough guy Danny Trejo in his first ever starring role, and yes Machete does get in a lot of killing, and yes the violence is truly over the top. I did laugh and roared at some of the over the top action, get to see sexy ladies in Michelle Rodriguez in some sexy hot pants, Jessica Alba in a provocative shower scene,(and I mean provocative)that just has to be seen by any guy ,Cheech Marin as a shotgun toting priest and nudity. All the B-movie fixings.So what was the problem? The message. This was a hate filled tirade against America and anti-immigration. About 98% of the bad guys here are white guys. I saw precisely one Black man and one Mexican bad guy. Everyone else was a hate filled racist that would make a snuff film of a pregnant woman getting killed and a frightened teen onlooker. They say, ""Welcome to America."" before putting hot lead in any Mexican in a sadistic glee.They run political ads that are over the top and continue to point out the EVIL U.S.A. cause apparently we are just a bunch of bloodthirsty hate filled psychopaths. Also we are some brain-dead rednecks that can't stand the sight of bloodshed.Bottom line, this is a big long political statement and a VERY hate filled monstrosity. Remember, Whitey is EVIL, America is EVIL. Mexico is GOOD. American women are GOOD. Add more insult: Steven Seagal as Torrez, a Mexican drug lord. Remember, Whitey is EVIL. Just so you don't forget. I am Robert Rodriguez and I approve this message.Needless to say, Machete is a tremendous disaster.

Danny is a veteran of many c-grade action movies, and he still managed to pull off the image of a scary but sympathetic tough guy. However, he was also wooden and uncharismatic, which made following his character as the central focus a little difficult.As for an enjoyable movie.......well, you do get lots of action, but it's not an homage to cheesy flicks, it goes over the top to almost horror movie level gore. It's like watching someone's caricature of an action movie blown out of all proportion, which in effect it is. I really had trouble watching it because of the violence, but with a title like ""Machete"" you can't say I wasn't warned.Lastly is what has created all the controversy; the politics. For one thing an ""exploitation"" movie usually doesn't carry a political message as it doesn't jibe well with the general lack of reality. If it does work it's usually satire, something people won't take seriously at face value, but may make them think. This, however, is pure, burning hatred. I'd never seen a movie so blatant in it's rage. So I guess I did get the second part of the movie, an action flick being exploited by the director to fume his views on immigration.",Machete

The over-the-top, intentionally cheesy touches that entertain in most of his films only manage to annoy in this one. What made Desperado, From Dusk Til Dawn and even the Grindhouse flicks fun just went a little too far into B-land with Machete, and past the point of watchable. The few positive exceptions: Danny Trejo: solid as ever. Cheech: nuff said. DeNiro: much funnier than his tragic SNL appearances. Jeff Fahey: great role for him, he should be working more. Don Johnson: I generally hate this guy on screen, but this was his role. Michelle Rodriguez: hotter and more believable than ever -- who'd o' thunk it? The rest was garbage, wasted potential. Sorry.

Then I remembered that the style of the Grindhouse series and quickly knew I was going to be in for a treat.The combination of action, violence and humor make this movie a great choice. The humor is almost slapstick in nature and fits quite well into the movie.The choices for actors was also great. Getting to see the return of some past stars, like Don Johnson in a role as a bad guy, made the movie even more interesting.If you can stomach the violence (an insider joke) you will surely enjoy the movie from start to finish.",Machete

I suppose would be the ideal film for late teens/early 20s men in their peak of testosterone. Nearly turned over when the warning said many violent scenes, but then I saw it had Robert De Nero in it, so I thought it might be worth watching, but he hardly appeared in it, and there was none of his usual acting magic. Almost as if he saw it as an easy pocket money job without putting much effort in. I suppose the gory scenes started to get more and more ridiculous and amusing the more it went on though, so why I watched until the end. Ending was very similar to many gangster films, with the main character running off with a girl on a motorcycle.",Machete

This movie just blew my mind and I can't help but wonder, why the hell isn't this on top 250? It's so awesome it definitely deserves a spot up there. But then again, 7.something isn't really all that bad.But I gotta tell you, this awesome piece of work really has everything. Action, gore, nudity, lots of laughs, great plot, story and message, great cast list, great one-liners and you'll get to see Jessica Alba nude in the shower. Well you don't get to see her nipples though but it's good enough. REALLY good enough! But enough about Jessica Alba. This movie will totally blow your mind and I strongly recommend it! Every actor in this movie really does give a strong performance and really manage to make every character epic. It was nice to see Steven Seagal as the bad guy for a change. He really did do a great job. Lindsay Lohan wasn't all that bad either. She was a lot better than expected. Danny Trejo really showed he could play the main guy and he did it to perfection. Machete is probably one of the most awesome characters I've ever seen.I don't even know if I can explain this anymore. It's hard to find words for how awesome this movie was! This movie really does take the word ""awesome"" to a totally new level. See it. You wont be disappointed. This is entertainment at its best.10/10! The only negative thing I can find about this movie is that Tom Savini weren't in the final fight. You never really saw him after the church scene, which is one of the most awesome scenes in the movie. But I wont spoil that one for you.

It is definitely not everybody's cup of tea, probably too absurd for a lot, but I liked it. It dragged in parts, but it was still very entertaining in a fun way. Just don't expect anything serious or believable. Basically, in case you don't know the story, Danny Trejo plays Machete, an ex ferale whos wife is brutally murdered, and who subsequently goes on an epic rampage to get revenge. There's nothing new here in the story, which is brief and to the point. Don't expect something intelligent, leave your brain at the door for this one. All in all it is good old fashioned mindless fun, but as I said it did start to get tiresome after a while (how long can you sit and watch a 60 year old man running around Amierca killing people with a machete?)

Who ever produced and funded this must have been in a Cartel, or a member of ""La EME"", this was that bad. It was about 30 min too long, and even though I love the cast members to death, even with two directors (if we can call them that), they couldn't get convincing roles to happen. This was a turd, that flushed around the bowl for 102 min. I wouldn't recommend this to an enemy. I would expect people, that don't know what making films entails, or who understand the artistry of film to go ""Screw you, this was awesome"", this movie,just sucked guys. It was poooooorly written, and I simply thought the entire time, the meets line on this one must have been ""Desparado, Meets Kill Bill (a long long stretch mind you), meets Grindhouse."" Look people Tarantino can't even do Tarantino anymore, please make good movies Hollywood.... please? It's been almost 6 years in between the greatness of the 300, and the more recent Inception, and ""Machete"" is what we are being offered daily.... This movie is a travesty...

Ripping his way from the screen to my brain, Machete slices the cojones off the competition this summer. From beginning to end, Machete doesn't fall short of delivering a deadly dose of non-stop action and gore to the audience. Armed with a unique arsenal of weaponry, Machete hacks his way pass every slasher movie out there. I don't think there was a single time that I wasn't at the edge of my seat laughing or saying ""Cool"". Rodriguez couldn't have picked a better cast. Everyone made stellar performances, yes even including Lindsay Lohan. Danny Trejo was born to play Machete hands down. I found Steven Seagals' character to be pretty funny I guess because it's kind of hard to picture him as a Mexican. It's true this movie deals a lot with the subject of illegal immigration, but I didn't feel like Rodriguez was trying to exploit an opinion. I feel that he was merely trying to make fun of the subject. With that said, if you're looking for action and adventure, I would definitely suggest going to see this movie.",Machete

It's a story of pretty much every film that Seagal acted in and he's the bad guy! Whole movie makes fun of those films. I agree, this is not a movie that everyone will like, but you can't look at it as if it was an action movie. We've all seen millions of films with a dude (Seagal usually) who's family gets slaughtered and then he seeks revenge. I just can't see how can this film be spoiled.

Other than a few naked shots of Lindsay Lohan and Alicia Rachel Marek there was nothing going on, nothing at all.

Don't get me wrong, I thought there were some good scenes in this movie but not enough to make a full length motion picture worthwhile. I suggest you (re)watch Grindhouse and Desperado instead of this mess of poor gore action and politics.PS! Why does Machete have 6 throwing knives and a bunch of machetes under his coat when he only uses the one in his hand?! Also Segal has gained enough weight to not be suitable for any action apparently so all scenes that required any movement at all were filmed with a double from behind and the 1 minute end fight was really boring.

I wasn't disappointed, on the contrary - I enjoyed this peace of crap very, very much. Well, the peace of crap it is, but it's was never meant to be something more. Well if Rodriguez's intention was to top Kill Bill or Desperado - he has definitely failed, but I think he just wanted to make something totally stupid and bombastic, but spectacular. In that case, I think he really succeeded. It's like a cheap beer - you know you should not drink it, but it's really hot summer day and it costs almost nothing, so why not!

Danny Trejo is in a great role here and what really makes the movie stand out is both the fact that Seagal is the rich villain, which is a change all his fans want to see and its a really good change and the amount of action and violence used in the movie. In contrast to the movie The Expendables, this movie has a lot more violent scenes, nothing that a Seagal fan wont be used to.

And the acting - yes the acting - was as bad as it can possibly get, with the exception of Danny Trejo. It seems he was relishing the opportunity to finally be the good guy in Hollywood. Jessica Alba was terrible and disappointing, Michelle Rodriguez was poor, and Steven Seagal? This guy should stop doing movies and stick to his community policing. Once again he proved that he is only good for one thing - bad acting in bad movies. He must win the worst actor award at this year's Razzie's. The high rating for this film is quite puzzling.

Yes if the script had a color it would be brown(no further explanation needed).Furthermore talking about the actors. OK Danny Trejo is good for nothing else than killing people in movies so..this is his kind of movie. But Robert De Niro? I mean how could he accept acting in this throne of stupidity? Jessica Alba same here..why would she accept? Lindsay Lohan is just making money out of everything so..it is pretty natural that she accepted.Steven Seagal is an awful actor anyway. If acting in this movie had a color it would be gray(which equals to boring). Moving on..I am surprised that there wasn't even a single scene worth watching. Where should I start? That time where ""Machette"" jumped of the building hanging from somebody's intestants? Or the fact that he had sex with every single woman on the movie while music taken from an 80's porn movie was playing in the background? Or even that he did that jump on the motorcycle while shooting everyone down? The directors job would have to be purple(stands for pathetic).I wish IMDb had a choice for 0 stars because 1 is just way too many..But believe me I am a guy who thinks Quentin Tarantino is not the BIG TALENT the media have created for everyone to beg..his movies are all the same starting with Kill Bill(which I kind of liked) to the kingdom of silliness..Pulp fiction.

I like Danny Trejo, Robert Deniro and Cheech Marin but wasted in the films bad storyline. I hope Danny Trejo gets better acting roles in the future.

345,ownbusinessmexico,Strap your seat belt on and get ready !!!,7,24 September 2010,"Movie of the Day: "" Machete"" starring Danny Trejo,Robert Deniro,Jessica Alba,Steven Segal, Michelle Rodriguez.Length: 1:.37:02Date of Review: 09-25-2010Rating : 7.00 Review: I was honestly going to turn it off after the first 2 minutes, but something told me to hold on, and I was pleasantly surprised by where it took me.It is based on a B movie satire and exploitation of the 70 & 80's B films but maybe this is why I should read reviews before I watch movies in the future. Funny enough, just yesterday, I was commenting on how I will say 99% of the movies I have watched, I never usually read the reviews before I watch, so I can really get a feel for the movie as it comes to me off the screen and let my emotions of that moment really ""feel the moment"" I am in.In this case I was caught completely off guard because I had no clue of whether it was a satire, horror (first few moments), an actual B movie, a comedy of sorts (like Airplane), or a Hollywood jump on the Mexican Border issues, as it had a number of controversial sequences and I thought I had joined the Glen Beck's campaign of lets become ""famous"" by attacking the Mexican / American issues. So my observation today to everyone is enjoy these reviews but understand what the movie's central theme is so in order to prepare for the ""events coming to a theatre near you"".But with Machete, I really was caught off guard. See I live in Mexico for over 20 years and I have a Mexican family although I am Canadian, and honestly the first 30 minutes of the movie I was really appalled not only at the comments but it seemed like such a bashing and exploitation of the Mexicans and stereotypical behaviour that I almost turned it off but again something told me to keep watching ( and of course it wasn't all the bloodshed or nudity but I will say I always like Danny Trejo's (Arnold Schwarzenegger man of few words attitude) so I kept watching).Then something surprising happened it started to make sense ( I started capturing the real essence and satirical nature of the film and like so many of the watchable B movies of the 70's and 80's they somehow grip onto you and you now just can't put it down. The humour and spoofs and political and racial remarks made started to take on a new film and meaning to the film for me.The movie is about a machete wielding ex-Federale (who's favourite weapon of choice = Machete) who's wife and child are murdered in the first scene by a drug king Boss (played by Steven Seagal) and then escapes to America through the Network (lead by Michelle Rodriguez who I will say was looking especially buffed up) which helps illegal Mexicans establish themselves in America. 3 years after the murder of his family Machete (played by Danny Trujo) is approached and can't refuse an offer to kill the US Senator (played by De Niro) who has jumped on the Border issues of America and very racist and inhumane killing any Mexicans that get in his way. Even starting with a DVD executing an illegal which they refer to as cockroaches and terrorists invading America.But the story behind it all is that Booth (played by Jeff Fahey) who plays the assistant to the Senator hired Machete to injure the Senator so the public would have sympathy of the Mexican attack of terrorists and vote him in, but Machete and the Network and a Immigration agent who goes rogue (Jessica Alba) who helps to put it public and the jump to the dynamic finish which by this point its feeling like Wow what a comeback compared to how I felt in the first 10-15 minutes of the movie (of course without reading any reviews I was blindsided but refreshingly surprised at how it turned me around by the end).Some things to watch for is quite a list of A actors who really did a great job with such tough content and Hollywood shakers (like Cheech Marin's box of Mexican cigars or Lindsay Lohan's completely Nude scene and her new found relationship with God) and the Director Rodriguez pulled it off and I think a reference to Quentin Terrentino's style was remarkably noticeable in this film.Overall, I liked it and felt a sense of comedy relief by the end although it honestly had my blood boiling at the start, but that's the mark of a good film, turn our emotions all around and leave us at the end appreciating what he was trying to really say to us.so we will be ready to listen.

For an action movie, not a horror, it's very violent and graphic. But since it's a movie about revenge, which I love, the more crude the better! The characters are very (stereo)typical/cliche, but in a good way. Machete is your typical hero of the people, the Senator is your average corrupt Senator, and so on. All the characters are exaggerated in a very amusing way. The action scenes are great and creative. Machete who almost only uses his Machete in a lot of different ways. If you like guns don't worry, plenty of those around. And then there's Michelle Rodriguez, who manages to look even better than Alba in this movie. Rest of the cast is great as well. To say there's no storyline would be an overstatement. It's not an epos, but the story is fine and fits the genre perfectly. So if you like all the things above. Basically if you are a male human being, go watch this movie! It might not be for everyone, but if you can for instance appreciate Tarantino movies I'm sure you'll love it!",Machete

Machete is just another typical good guy vs. the bad guy story. Kind of like the Mexican Rambo. Machete (played by Danny Trejo) is a Mexican federal and gets betrayed by his own men. His wife gets killed and he swears revenge. The movie contains unnecessary and bad edited splatter scenes, which are probably made out of purpose. Mechete Cortez doesn't like Guns and uses his.. uhh ... Machete to kill a army of heavily armed people. This fact makes the movie so much worse. It has simply no realistic touch and made me feel like watching an Sci-Fi Movie. However, if you like all what i don't like (which aren't less people, if you see the rating) than you should definitely give the movie a shot. It has great actors (who also act great in this movie), which give the movie a good portion of quality. All in all i was disappointed, from my posteriors feeling, which were all ""excited"".

The completely unnecessary amount of sex and nudity, the swagger of the title character, the unrelenting violence and the pure coolness of every line.From the outside looking in, the cast of this movie is truly a bunch of misfits. Steven Seagal (who I didn't know still acted) as the villain, Danny Trejo as the lead, mercurially fitting Jessica Alba, Michelle Rodriguez, Robert DeNiro, Jeff Fahey, Cheech Marin, Don Johnson and Lindsay Lohan all into it as a spectacular supporting cast. There were quotable lines for every character, and every single one of them seemed integral to the plot.It's a movie you couldn't get bored during even if you tried. Rounding up all the tricks and set-ups with a classic Rodriguez-style guns blazing showdown right at the end; with the classy touch of Lindsay Lohan appearing out of nowhere dressed as a Nun, armed with an SMG. However, Cheech Marin and Don Johnson could've had more screen time, and Michele Rodriguez seemed to be reciting her lines as though she was coerced into it.I was equally surprised at some higher level performances by the rest of the cast though, with Robert DeNiro finally appearing in his first good movie in the last four years and even Jessica Alba held her own.All in all, one of the funnest movies of 2010, leaving me more than satisfied, and clucking for the next Rodriguez fix.

The directing was cheesy and campy, even for a movie that was intentionally so. The action sequences were extremely unbelievable, and the dialogue was absolutely horrendous.

Let's be honest folks, even Mariachi sucked, yes it was entertaining and yes he made it with $7,000(so the legend goes) but the production value bites and also he's girlfriend, who's now his recently divorced wife, had huge connections in the industry and helped Robert get his film seen. Her grandfather created the first privately owned TV station in Venezuela...lost of money and lots of influence. Robert is not that talented.

Got to admit I did laugh a bit during the ""shoot out"" but I don't know if it was because it was funny or just plain stupid. Never cared much for Seagal so this movie and his role were about par for the course. Jessica Alba, Michelle Rodriquez and Lohan all wanting to climb into bed with Machete, on what planet?????? Thank God I didn't have to pay to see this in a theater, watched it on HBO (had nothing better to do).

With actors and actresses's like Robert DeNiro, Steven Seagal, Jessica Alba, Michelle Rodriguez, Lindsey Lohan, Don Johnson and Cheech Marin you can figure this movie will likely be a cult classic. The music score is fantastic, the special effects outstanding and the screenplay superb. Danny Trejo is the real thing. Just read his biography. It's nice to see him finally hit the big time.

I see a lot of movies and can't believe viewers thought this was great, because i saw bad quality, low budget, weak acting, and nude women thru the whole movie. The story was stupid, corny, insulting, and boring.more like a spaghetti western in the 70's with some killing, but had bad film, story, acting, low budget quality.

Hopefully my 1 star vote will brings this down to at least a 3. Anyway, just another silly and over the top action POS movie by Robert Rodriguez. Just see what else this guy has done such as the AWFUL Planet Terror and lame Once Upon a Time In Mexico. How does this guy still have a job in Hollywood? Whats more is how he manages to get well known actors to star in these cheesy flicks (Alba, DeNiro, Depp, Willis, etc.) I guess there isn't much discipline with his style of directing just allowing the actors to not do their jobs effectively...who knows. The plot is pretty basic story of revenge and murder. Nothing special here whatsoever. It felt like the actors involved in this project were just not trying at all. When you have Steven Segal playing the main villain, just tells you its gonna be bad. I KNOW its not suppose to be taken seriously and the whole grindhouse genre/era blah blah blah, but damn it was just THAT bad.

Long live pirates!!!!",Machete
365,wilsonjd2,"Bloody, Cartoonish Fun",7,19 September 2010,"The action/revenge genre has far more to offer in the way of satire than the zombie genre, as was proved by Quentin Tarantino's superior half of ""Grindhouse,"" the double feature extravaganza directed by Robert Rodriguez and Tarantino. The seed for ""Machete"" was planted in that as one of many fake movie trailers cushioned around the main events. At first glance, I realized that the trailer resembled the exact plot of Antoine Fuqua's ""Shooter,"" released the same year as ""Grindhouse."" Now Rodriguez has expanded it to 105 minutes and added more plot threads and characters, and even though it is brutally self-aware and bizarre, it is much more fun for it, and it is a better movie than ""Shooter"" was.Machete (Danny Trejo) is a Mexican ex-federale turned day laborer. There is a sizzling controversy in Texas over the waves of illegal immigrants crossing the border, and because it's an election year, Senator McLaughlin (Robert De Niro) is campaigning against the ""infestation,"" and in the name of America, the land of the free, home of the brave. In one of the many casting gems, Don Johnson from TV's ""Miami Vice"" plays Lt. Stillman, the ruthless leader of an underground organization that specializes in gunning down immigrants trying to cross the border. The Senator is associated with this organization, and he regularly joins Stillman on his hunts in the desert. Standing around waiting for work, Machete is picked up by Michael Booth (Jeff Fahey), a man in a suit with a briefcase full of cash. He offers Machete the case in return for one job: He must kill Senator McLaughlin. He gives him a do it or die ultimatum, and so it's a job he can't refuse. But of course, Booth is just as seedy and sleazy as he appears, and Machete is betrayed and left for dead. He then seeks revenge against his betrayers in some of the bloodiest and (in some instances) most creative ways I have seen on film. I think I will forever remember the length of the large intestine after having seen this movie.There is also an opposing force to Stillman's called the Network, which fights for immigrant rights and joins Machete in his quest for revenge against Booth and the rest. The Network is led by a mythical figure called She, and is aided greatly by a taco stand operator named Luz (Michelle Rodriguez). There is also an Immigrant and Customs agent named Sartana (Jessica Alba), Machete's priest brother (Cheech Marin), and mega drug lord Torrez (Stephen Seagal, another casting gem). Every once in a while, a movie comes along that shows you images that you could never have anticipated or conceived on your own, but that you maybe could have dreamt one night after eating too many sweets or hallucinogens before bed. ""Machete"" conjures up a plethora of such images, and then some. It surpasses the absurdities that were present in his previous ""grindhouse"" effort, ""Planet Terror,"" and there is more to appreciate in the way of political satire. Seriously, how often is it that you see Lindsay Lohan in a nun's uniform gunning down a crowd of rebels, or Cheech Marin getting crucified? It's all very cartoonish, but in the best way possible.The script by Rodriguez and his cousin Alvaro is hilarious, and contains some terrific one- liners. The movie was shot and edited in a much cleaner fashion than the trailer was, and in that sense Rodriguez steps outside of the ""grindhouse"" barriers just a bit. Rodriguez' band Chingon provides an awesome soundtrack, and it is great to finally see Trejo take on a starring role. He has always had a great presence on screen, and to see him take the spotlight and splatter it with his enemies' entrails is bloody good fun. And of course, Machete always gets the girls always.",Machete

This is a movie for adults, not politically correct man-children who think movies should be a mixture of Disney World and Sunday School. Bottom line, when you have a talent and you make a movie using creativity and good intention (entertainment) it will always be good, when you make a movie to make as much money as possible, it will always suck. If it were not for creative film makers like Robert Rodriguez I would have given up on new movies long ago, there are not enough creative forces like him in the business, I hope he keeps making the great movies he makes and not listening to the Micky Mouse critics for a long long time, the world needs it!",Machete

370,ranz417,Silly and Funny.,3,4 September 2010,"Well it has action and a political message. First the action. It was poorly choreographed and silly. The scripting was amateur at best. You will feel like your in a 1950's B movie. So if Rodriquez wanted that feel, he accomplished it. There is lots of action and it is over the top, totally un-realistic but many movies are like that now. This was just done is a poorly filmed manner. The Expendiables has the same un-realistic action, but filmed in a professional manner so it was much more entertaining. I loved Rodriquez's Desperado, but this isn't anything close to that with the camera angles and choreograph.The political message was bizarre to say the least. Either Robert Rodriquez was trying to be silly about it (which IMO hurts his message) or he is delusional about the reality of what he is saying. I tend to believe he is being silly about it all. People in the audience were outright laughing at the parts of the movie when he gets preachy and he gets preachy a lot in this movie.The scripting was also very amateur and full of really lame clichés. Just like a ""B"" movie. One has to assume it was written this way and presented this way.So if you like a silly and funny bizarre ""B"" movie with lots of action and an over the top unbelievable political message this movie is for you. But if Mr. Rodriquez continues in this manner, his career as a serious film maker in Hollyweird will be over. All the hype from the first weekend will generate some bucks, but I predict it will die quickly in the following weeks.

I'll put this on the same page as the movie Ninja, Surrogates, and Stomp the Yard 2. The only reason this thing is in the money right now is because the budget was so damn cheap, which gives good reason as to why they couldn't even afford some good special effects. I'll bet that out of the 20 Million allocated, 19 went to the has-been cast, and the other 1 Million went to machetes and tacos, and the hydraulics on those ridiculous cars. No, actually I take that back; another 1 Million probably went to paying people to rate this thing a 7.4! It baffles me that actors who actually used to be something like Robert Deniro would even consider a film like this.

If you like some semblance of truth, this is not he film for you.The state of Texas helped to subsidize the production of this film. Keyword search: machete race war. Infowars . com",Machete
386,genesisjo6,All I hoped for & a TON more!!!,10,14 March 2011,"When I first saw the other Grindhouse movies and a commercial for this I Hoped and Wished that Machete would be real and 'BOOM' I got what I wanted (plus some). Loved this particular humor, sense of danger with hints of mystery, supped up 'XXX' cars, insane variety of violent weapons and of course a perfectly picked out cast of wonderful lady hotness and a mix of dirty strong sexy & sweaty Mexican men (Yummm to both!). If you dig the Grindhouse movies you'll feel right at home with this one. It's a 'Mexican treasure', as far as my man and I are concerned. Watch from beginning to end. There are so many precious gems you would not want to miss. Lots of fun to watch with some friends, a 12 pack of beer so you can kick back and enjoy yourself! JoJo",Machete
387,lenadamn,Horrible movie,3,29 June 2011,"The movie is slow leading on to almost no plot line. I found myself constantly finding something else to do while the movie was playing even sleeping at times. A lot of people like Danny Trejo but I felt that his short dialog was a good comparison to what Megan Fox did with Transformers. He wasn't usually casted in lead roles and this being the reason. He had no expression throughout the movie but maybe that's more of his character, it just took away from the movie in my opinion. And Jessica Alba, god, if anyone in the world think that she can act from just seeing this movie they must be joking. She is nothing more than a pretty face to be a placeholder in the movie. Boring and unnecessary. Michelle Rodriguez is as wonderful as she always is and always plays a believable role. On to the movie, like I said boring and draggy. Nothing as gore(y) as anyone else is saying in the reviews. Definite B-rated movie that should not be consider an action movie but more of a comedic type. Overtly corny and if you don't want to waste your time, don't see it.I stopped watching halfway through.",Machete
388,hal-k,It doesn't add anything to the fake trailer,4,18 August 2013,"The fake trailer was weird and funny, but after having seen Machete I can say that the idea of making a full movie has been a complete disaster. Almost everything good was already in the trailer and the other scenes have added nothing to the movie.Poor acting, a poor subject (that worked only for the length of a trailer) and a poor director always make a poor film. I was quite curious about Machete, but even my low expectations have been way too high: this film is not even fun to watch, and sadly Rodriguez confirms once more that between his works and Tarantino's ones there is a chasm. Furthermore, this film is also inferior to ""Grindhouse: Planet Terror"" -- and I've enjoyed much more the fake trailers than the ""two"" films -- and one of the worst of Rodriguez. Stay away.",Machete
389,sebastian-grunfeld,"Machete do a job, where he shall kill a senator.",4,13 January 2014,"I watched Machete, because I was looking for some hardcore, very bloody and over-the-top violence. Okay, so I start the film. And I must say, the start is just as I expected (maybe even better) and I expected this to be a nice violent film. Okay, so here we go to the characters. Machete is a boring, really not interesting character, who kills without feeling anything and loves his family really much. The born cool cat , you know, he's like Rambo, just 40 years older + he doesn't talk weird. Already here we got a problem, why the beep did Rodriquez hire a 64 year old man to play a killer, who had to be in good shape. I don't get, but, it's okay, i'll just continue watching. Then then there's Jessica Alba as the immigration policewoman. I guess her character was o.k. but as all the others very cliché. Btw, I hate her personality (okay, this has nothing to do with the movie) and i also hated her in this role. She was just the familiar very annoying girl, who thought she was kinda cool. Then there's Luz, who runs a taco truck, and secretly is ""she"", who is the leader of this illegal Mexican immigration network. So the character ""she"" is actually a bit interesting, but it doesn't has as much to do with the movie as i thought, and I am a bit disappointed about that, because I think it would have been a better movie, if ""she"" was more in it. All in all an okay, but a bit boring movie, which sometimes get a little too political, the violence in it was great beside the ending scene, the acting and the characters not good, funny= i didn't bust out laughing, but there were some fun scenes. All in all an okay movie, and if you like violence watch it, if you don't like violence then don't watch it.",Machete
390,victorlazlo59,Race Baiting and Incitement to Violence,1,11 September 2010,"This film should be pulled from screens immediately. Incitement to violence, such as Jessica Alba's character calling for a race war, and Danny Trejo's threat to Arizonans, are not protected free speech. Greedy theater owners will be held accountable if any Arizonan is harmed because of this movie's hate filled message. Boycott this film, and any future films of any of it's actors and it's director. If you live in Arizona, contact Russell Pearce or your state representative and urge them to ban this film in Arizona. Illegal immigration is just that, illegal. Mexico has no claim to any US territory. The original intent of the 14th Amendment did NOT contain any provision for foreigners to come here and drop babies left and right so they can backdoor citizenship. No country in it's right mind would do that, and no other country in the world allows it. This movie is nothing but mindless violent racist trash and soft core porn, avoid it at all costs.",Machete
391,andrast79,worst movie ever.,1,17 September 2010,"I don't have much to comment. This film is the worst copy of Quentin Tarantino movies I have ever seen. Nothing is original, the characters are a cheap copies from kill bill or inglorious bastards. I waste my time with this movie. I am forced to write 10 lines about this movie. It's childish violence is both comic and useless. The characters has no personality and if I will try to remember this movie tomorrow a am sure that a will not remember anything. The story is ambiguous, the characters forget who they are during the film. This film is only useful maybe for frustrated Mexican people who are coming back from the borders.",Machete
392,santasoucio,Garbage Garbage Garbage,1,10 September 2010,"This is an ignorant Caucasian bashing film. Here we have a plot of the mindless evil white American citizens killing Mexican's for...for...well there doesn't need to be a reason when you're mindless and evil does it? If this movie was more about entertainment, then I'd judge it on those merits, instead it takes a detour into political propaganda and so I must judge it on those merits, since that seems to be the major apparent theme. The fun special effects and tongue-in-cheek humor seem to be a vehicle to deliver a message about violent revolution against American citizens.If you missed the propaganda message in this movie, let me rehash in a language you can understand; whites bad...illegals good.Any additional words on that basic theme implies the movie actually offered more than the most limited neanderthalish view.If you want to be a dog and spend money for a movie that spits on decency and intelligence, do so - at least - with a concept of the ignorance you embrace.",Machete
393,Model-Behavior,A Rating of 8.1 ? .... You have got to be joking!,4,6 September 2010,"Wow! I think that all of you missed the point on this one, and so did the studio. The one genre they left out was that this film was a comedy, a political satire.The audience was hysterical with laughter during the film! It's like a ""Spaghetti-Western"" and ""Austin Powers"" all rolled into one. A real comedy! A spoof of all 'man' films. :-)) It's going to become another one of those cult classics, but hardly in a good way. The acting was horrid, the script was below elementary school level, the line delivery was some of the poorest that I've ever heard, and Michele Rodriguez continued to play Michele Rodriguez. Lindsay Lohan was funny, but she too was just being Lindsay Lohan.The only good performance was that of Robert De Niro, who is always on top of his game.If you are rating this as a comedy, then I can understand the rating of 8.1, but if you're rating this on drama, action, and politics, the film isn't worth more than a 5.This film is great for a laugh, but an 8.1 masterpiece it is not!",Machete
394,buckeyebred,Just Awful.,1,23 June 2016,"I mean if you want to see a movie that makes a white Senator who wants to keep illegals outs of America (which is not a bad thing) out to be a killer and racist scumbag then you will like this movie. It has horrible acting and a pathetic script to go along with an overall completely butt backwards reality on a real major problem in America. Just another low end political agenda push for someone who wants free things, doesn't speak English and doesn't pay taxes but wants citizenship. Danny Trejo is a classic bad actor in cheesy movies. I'm not against him in certain movies like Halloween he did a good job. But as for Jessica Alba she is worse than ever. She just still can't act at all. De Niro is the only credible actor in the whole movie and of course is depicted as the scumbag inwhich he plays the role well. I just can't believe that people would actually claim this to be a good movie. And to give an excuse saying its this way because of the genre does not make crap not crap. Final verdict $1 Walmart movie",Machete
395,introbridgeLE,To anyone who gave this film a negative review,10,5 September 2010,"I believe that too many people are caught trying to compare this movie to every other action movie that comes out. If you paid to see Machete and some how you were not expecting this gruesome, hilarious, and corny B-movie/(M)exploitation send up then I have no doubt that you would be disappointed. I went into this movie saying that if it was literally just Danny Trejo beheading people for 1.5 hours then I would be thrilled, because so few writers/directors have the freedom that a Rodriguez or a Tarentino have to make this kind of non-mainstream movie. However that is the point; this movie was marketed as exactly what it is and in my opinion Rodriguez takes his heavy-weight skills in this picture to create a brilliantly over-the-top actioner that delivers ten-fold on it's intentions. With his direction and writing it's too good to be a B-movie, however it makes up for it in all the intentionally cheesy clichés, from the performances complete with no character development and unbelievable action. 99% of writers/directors would so easily miss the mark with a movie like this and I don't think that people realize that. This movie will have you laughing and still manage to impress with the direction of brilliantly choreographed and shot scenes that will redeem its ridiculous premise. If you are tired of the same old unbelievable action movies like The Expendables or The A-Team then you should see this film; while it is just as unbelievable- it is self-aware and manages to take you on a thrill-ride of a trip.",Machete
396,jjohns33,Machete delivers,8,3 September 2010,"This film is what it says it is. Nothing less. And perhaps a little more. Most of Machete's critics that have given overall negative reviews, have fallen into a trap of their own devices. Machete is an exploitation film and was advertised as such. By definition, and exploitation film will include excessive violence, gore, nudity, and be high on intentional corny lines while low on plot devices and character development. To give low ratings to Machete because of one's distaste for the genre, would be like saying ""The Shinning was awful because I don't like horror."" This is one of Rodriguez best films to date, side by side with Sin City (2005). Machete delivers on all accounts of action, gore, nudity, and corny lines. The plot is simple, but honestly, that's how it should be. The thing that sets this apart from other exploitation films is that the acting is top notch. I personally found that the three main female characters to be the most intriguing and diverse.Jessica Alba plays the part of an ICE agent struggling with her loyalty to her nation and her people. She slowly begins to question her own logic on if people should follow law simply because they are laws. We see this struggle immediately, when she approaches a taco stand (apparently once every week) to by a coffee and lunch, despite her own people feeling from her site. Why does she continue this ritual? She says it is to check the papers of the character Luz, but really it is to try and hold onto a sliver of identity among her people. Michelle Rodriguez plays said Luz (aka She) as an underground leader of illegal immigration. The character of Luz is a simple woman who believes in not bending to the broken system, but fighting for her people (the mirror image of Alba). ""She"" is only a myth on which Luz has built a cult following, understanding that sometimes being a myth can do more damage than flesh and blood. By the end of the film, Luz is reborn as the mythical She, just in time for the bloody battle.Finally, the actress that surprised me the most was Lindsay Lohan. Despite only receiving 10-15 minutes of screen time (most are which she is undressed), she plays her character perfectly and flawlessly. The role seems to be written specifically for her and I applaud her for stepping up and taking on such a mature role. One of her first scenes is a tongue-in-cheek conversation about how she needs to give the people of the internet what they want, and that is more of her. Lohan played the part beautifully (in all aspects) and specks of talent are clearly visible. I hope that filmmakers and audiences (as well as herself) continue to allow her opportunities to showcase that talent. Machete is an exploitation film at its finest. And, for the most part, if you are the type of cinema attendee who wants to see a movie called Machete in the first place, chances are you will be thoroughly entertained.",Machete
