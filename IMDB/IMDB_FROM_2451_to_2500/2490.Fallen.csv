0,Leofwine_draca,"Hugely underrated, one of my favourites of the decade",9,11 July 2016,"With a clever central premise and a refreshing lack of any special effects work whatsoever (apart from a nifty 'demon vision' which is used occasionally), FALLEN is a cut above the standard fare of today's American horror films. With a more complex plot than usual (for once, the film doesn't underestimate the intellect of the viewer) and plenty of suspense and nightmarish scenes built up, this will be a refreshing treat for any horror fan.It must be made clear, though, that no matter how clever FALLEN thinks it is, one thing it is not is original. While the theme of the story's hero being implicated in the crimes by the real, supernatural criminal of the piece harks back to CANDYMAN, the real concept of a force which can swap bodies at will actually goes back to the late '80s in the form of such cult classics as THE HIDDEN and SHOCKER. This time around the evil force is more believable though, because there are no rubbery or slimy special effects, the demon is ever invisible. If you will, more is less.One thing I liked about this film is that full use is made of the demon's ability to swap bodies, and many times it escapes just as its about to be caught. Dozens of people get the demon inside them, and there is one great moment where it travels through a queue of people, as one after another they transfer the demon to each other. Another disconcerting moment is when the demon gets inside the police station and one person after another starts singing ""time is on my side"". Aside from the central killer, the film is very much in the style of SEVEN, in that the settings are gloomy and there is a depressingly downbeat ending. The influence of THE X-FILES is also clear, with impossibly bright torches lighting up dingy surroundings, and Washington could easily be substituted for Mulder.Denzel Washington is well-cast in the role of John Hobbes, a typical everyday sort of detective who displays no psychic powers or anything, he's just a believable, clever guy who uses his wits to catch the demon out. Washington is given able support by three actors and actresses who perform well in their roles and who all come out looking good. Firstly there is John Goodman, looking very much older these days, who plays his typical mild-mannered friendly person. Donald Sutherland is also on hand to lend distinguished and solid support, and it's always great to see Sutherland in a film. Whatever critics might say, he's a good guy. Embeth Davidtz (ARMY OF DARKNESS) plays the female lead who is unsurprisingly underused, but for once she plays a well-drawn out, realistic female character in a horror film.Fallen deserves kudos for being a little bit more intelligent than the more typical blockbusters filling out the horror shelves these days. There are plenty of twists for the mystery fan to enjoy, and a gripping finale, which, like ARLINGTON ROAD, doesn't succumb to the sappy sentimental ending so beloved of most of these films. I can only praise it for the lack of special effects which, like THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT showed, don't necessarily make a good film.",Fallen
1,SnoopyStyle,great premise with poor execution,5,9 November 2015,"Police detective John Hobbes (Denzel Washington) watches Edgar Reese (Elias Koteas) who he caught, get executed on death row. Reese's spirit seems to leave his body. Lt. Stanton (Donald Sutherland) is Hobbes' superior. Hobbes and his partner Jonesy (John Goodman) investigate a murder with a message seemingly from Reese. His investigation leads to Gretta Milano (Embeth Davidtz). The spirit is actually the fallen angel Azazel who had possessed Reese.The premise holds a lot of promise but the execution is really lacking. Even with Denzel in the lead, this movie struggles to get going. I think it starts off poorly. It could have started with Hobbes catching Reese in the first place. It could have laid out more of the premise early on. The handshake between Hobbes and Reese is suppose to be something big but the audience has no idea what it was suppose to be. It needs some exposition. The movie is generally too long and too slow. It needs a lot of tightening and general rethinking. Also ""Time Is On My Side"" is not necessarily the best idea. It needs to be something creepier like a nursery rhythm or a simple melody without words.",Fallen
2,gavin6942,Mostly Good,7,9 October 2015,"Homicide detective John Hobbes witnesses the execution of serial killer Edgar Reese (Elias Koteas). Soon after the execution the killings start again, and they are very similar to Reese's style.Roger Ebert gave the film a mixed review, writing ""the idea is better than the execution, and... the surprises become too mechanical and inevitable."" There is some truth to that. The biggest problem is just how long the film runs. There seems to be plenty of fat that could have been trimmed.It also seems ""too neat"". This killer (or demon) could be going around, ruining people's lives, but he is obsessed with one cop. And rather than kill the cop or ruin his life, he first decides to drop hints on how to figure out he is a demon and how his power is transferred. Sure, you need some kind of exposition, but it just makes no sense.",Fallen
3,lee_eisenberg,"copied from Wes Craven's ""Shocker""",5,20 June 2006,"I might have given ""Fallen"" a higher grade if it hadn't been an obvious rehash of Wes Craven's inventive ""Shocker"", in which a killer gets executed but his spirit keeps getting passed around to different people. OK, so Denzel Washington, John Goodman, Donald Sutherland, Embeth Davidtz, James Gandolfini and Elias Koteas do a good job with their roles (especially Goodman when imitating Mick Jagger), but watching the movie, I just kept repeating to myself: ""This is basically a 'Shocker' rip-off."" So, my advice to you is to watch Wes Craven's original version. I do wish to assert that it's actually more interesting.",Fallen
4,jboothmillard,Fallen,5,8 July 2017,"I remember hearing about this film in the past on DVD, and later I knew it better for the leading actor, then I saw it had more good names in the cast, and it sounded like an interesting plot, so I tried it, directed by Gregory Hoblit (Primal Fear, Frequency, Hart's War, Fracture, Untraceable). Basically serial killer Edgar Reese (Elias Koteas) is on death row, Philadelphia Police Detective John Hobbes (Denzel Washington) who helped capture Reese visits him the day of his execution, Reese grabs his hand and says something in an unknown language, in the gas chamber he sings ""Time is on My Side"" by the Rolling Stones until he dies. A short time later, a string of copycat murders have been occurring, Hobbes and his partner Jonesy (John Goodman) investigate, Hobbes through a series of clues tracks down Gretta Milano (Embeth Davidtz), the connection is that her father was a detective and killed himself after being accused of demonic-themed murders. Hobbes goes to Milano's lake house, and finds a book about demonic possession, he also sees the name ""Azazel"" written on a wall, mentioning this name to Gretta, she gravely advises him to drop the case to save himself and his family. Meanwhile, the soul of Reese, or Azazel, was seen leaving his body after his death, then entering the body of a guard, his soul then transfers from body to body by touch, Gretta explains to Hobbes that that Azazel is a fallen angel with the power to possess human beings by touch. Azazel in a new body finds Hobbes at his precinct and taunts him, jumping from body to body singing """"Time is on My Side"", it gets worse when Azazel is able to possess John's nephew Sam (Michael J. Pagan), and attacks his intellectually disabled brother Art (Bedazzled's Gabriel Casseus), before fleeing into other people on the street. Later Azazel boasts to Hobbes that even if his host body is killed, he can transfer into any host in the surrounding area, without the need of touch. It again gets worse when Lieutenant Stanton (Donald Sutherland) informs Hobbes that his fingerprints were found at one of the murder scenes, Azazel possesses many witnesses to give false information about what happened, throwing further suspicion on Hobbes. Hobbes takes Sam to Gretta's for safety, she tells him that Azazel can only travel in spirit form for the time one breath can sustain, he will die permanently if he does not possess another host in time. Hobbes goes to the Milano's cabin and calls Jonesy, knowing he will trace the call, Jonesy and Stanton arrive to arrest Hobbes, however Jonesy reveals himself to be possessed Azazel, he kills Stanton, Azazel prepares to shoot himself in order to possess Hobbes, the only body for miles. In a struggle, Hobbes manages to shoot Jonesy and mortally wound, but Hobbes tells Azazel he has poisoned himself, which will leave him without a host, Hobbes shoots and kills Jonesy, Azazel possesses Hobbes' body, but trying to flee he succumbs to the poison, his soul floats in the air to the point where he almost dies, but at the last minute a cat emerges from underneath the cabin, Azazel possessing it heads back to civilisation. Also starring The Sopranos' James Gandolfini as Lou and Robert Joy as Charles Olom. Washington is good as the homicide detective trying to catch the spiritual psycho, the supporting cast members do what they can, it is certainly a clever idea, a killer that can move from person to person by a simple touch, meaning paranoia and confusion for those trying to catch him, an evil ancient god being the cause is obvious, but the story is uneven and unresolved, the conclusion is memorable enough, overall it is daft, but a creepy and interesting enough supernatural thriller. Worth watching, at least once!",Fallen
5,ccthemovieman-1,Legitimately Creepy,8,27 February 2006,"This gets good marks simply because it is such an interesting, involving story that hooks you right away and every time you watch it and doesn't overwhelm you with violence and gore.Denzel Washington is appealing as always as the good guy and John Goodman is surprisingly low-key for most of the movie. All the characters are very interesting and the special effects are creepy.The story is pure ""Hollywood theology"" mean also means the characters - include the heroes - in here have no clue about God or the purpose of life. Believability-aside, it film provides excellent entertainment. The visuals are decent and sound-effects are chilling in spots. As the demon sees through the eyes of people and passes by with these ""whoosh"" sounds, it's very effective. As mentioned, the film doesn't need a lot of violence to succeed with it's horror-type tale. One note about the final scene. It isn't exactly clear on a couple of points so if you get confused, you aren't alone.",Fallen

7,moonspinner55,Scattershot thriller hurt by ridiculous finish,6,16 October 2007,"A transitory evil spirit (or, ""fallen angel"") plays cat-and-mouse with police detective Denzel Washington, who is so cool-headed and amiable that this taunting, easily-transferable demon barely seems to ruffle his good nature. Occasionally gripping and yet only satisfactory police drama-cum-occult thriller opens with a heavy-handed introductory sequence to the players (fellow detective James Gandolfini behaves like a pushy ass in a bar, requiring Denzel to give a soap-box speech on the privileged nature of policemen). The religious angle is half-hearted, at best, while the plot minutiae is sometimes overheated (as with Washington's narration, which verges on camp: ""In the night...sometimes you run into yourself"" or ""That question about God...what the hell did that mean?""). The scenario is so muddled it's tough to discern what city the picture takes place in. It has flashes of film-noir, but it isn't respectful to its own characters. Intriguing, unusual, but mostly uneven. **1/2 from ****",Fallen
8,michaelRokeefe,The time has come to not trust a handshake.,6,8 February 2003,"This is a murky, supernatural drama of a Philadelphia homocide cop(Denzel Washington) struggling to solve a series of bizarre murders linked to the occult. It seems the spirit of a serial killer is passed from body to body by touch. This is an intriguing blend of murder mystery and supernatural chiller. You may need a second viewing to understand the story line. It is well worth it. Washington is sterling as always.

9,jotix100,Shake hands with the devil,8,25 July 2005,"""Fallen"" is a thriller that combines crime with the occult. Director Gregory Hobllit has produced a movie that is entertaining as well as good to watch. The screen play by Nicholas Kazan shows a lot of imagination in the way it plays.The real achievement though is in the great casting for the film. Denzel Washington makes ""Fallen"" his movie and runs away with it. As John Hobbs, the police detective, he is seen at the beginning attending the execution of the criminal Edgar Reese. This is a monster who is put to death for crimes he committed. Hobbs is only happy to see this evil man get his due, but in the process he makes a serious mistake. When Reese offers his hand to Hobbs to shake, he passes some of his repulsive self to Hobbs, and thus the chain in the killings of innocents will continue. While this seems to be an improbable fact, it gives the director and his writer a great premise to explore.John Goodman, as Jonesy, is particularly good. Donald Sutherland, Embeth Davidtz, James Gandolfini and Elias Koteas do excellent work under Mr. Hoblit's able direction.",Fallen
10,LeonLouisRicci,Notes From the Underground,7,14 March 2014,"This Supernatural Thriller tries very hard but Ultimately when the Fat Guy Sings, not quite. Denzel Washington seems Slightly Miscast and the Lady Professor of Theology is Underused and Her Involvement in the Story should be Essential and Informative and it is Neither.The Look and Style of the Movie is Effective and the Story is a Fresh Take on an Ancient Theme but there is Something Amiss in this. The Film Never Sinks to the Depths of a Hellish Situation and the Demonic Playfulness stays more in the Playful and Seldom Ventures into Depravity. its all kind of Surface when there Needs to be some Chills from the Underground that made Seven (1995) a Gut-Wrenching Hit.The Creepiness is there and Enough Rhythmic Rousings to make this Worth a Watch, but it is Handled at Times in a Very Safe Manner and that does not Bode Well for the Horrifying Material and Bad Angel Behavior.",Fallen
11,poolandrews,"OK supernatural horror thriller, not too bad but not too great either.",5,24 July 2005,"Fallen starts with convicted serial killer Edgar Reese (Elias Koteas) being executed in the gas chamber as the man who brought him to justice Detective Jon Hobbes (Denzel Washington) looks on. Hobbes thinks that this is the end but soon has to rethink as he receives a phone call which tells him to check a house out where he finds a dead man named Muscovich (Glen Witko) in a bathtub having been poisoned, the same way Reese used to kill his victims. At first Hobbes fears a copy cat killer but during the course of his investigation the name Robert Milano comes up, a decorated cop who apparently committed suicide. Hobbes speaks with his daughter Gretta (Embeth Davidtz) who at first is reluctant to speak with him. Things become even stranger when the man who killed Muscovich, Charles (Robert Joy) is found dead in exactly the same way having been poisoned again. Eventually Gretta tells Hobbes the truth, he is in fact dealing with an ancient demon called Azazel who has the power to jump form body to body at will by mere psychical touch. The demon Azazel seems to be taunting Hobbes, ruining his life & career, setting him up for murder & getting to his friends & family. Hobbes must find a way to destroy the ancient demon before it destroys him & everyone he cares about...Directed by Gregory Hoblit I thought Fallen was an OK time waster but nothing special. The script by Nicholas Kazan is far too slow & at 2 hours Fallen is just too long. It never gripped me or excited me, it's all very average & a bit of a chore to sit through certain parts. It's a very small scale film in the way that it feels, there are no big action scenes, only a couple of off screen murders which amount to very little over the course of a 2 hour film. The plot of Fallen sounds very horror orientated but in actual fact there is hardly any straight horror elements here, there are no scares, the demon itself is never seen & Fallen lacks any atmosphere or tension. The biggest problem I had with Fallen was why did Azazel go after Hobbes? I mean this ancient demon can jump form body to body at will & could go anywhere & do anything so why go after one cop? Personally I would jump into some mega rich person & live it up a bit! The flimsy explanation of Hobbes being one of the chosen few on Earth to fight these demons just doesn't hold water with me when it's given one line of dialogue throughout the whole film. Director Hoblit uses various MTV style editing tricks to try & modernise it I suppose, slow motion, colour filters, quick cuts & hand held jerky camera movements you know the sort of thing. Technically Fallen is fine with that very polished if somewhat bland Hollywood look about it. There is no blood or gore in Fallen a few bloody gunshots apart so forget about anything like that, again isn't Fallen meant to be a horror? The acting is OK, Denzel does OK although I can't see why he's one of Hollywoods hottest properties at moment on the evidence in Fallen, John Goodman turns up as Hobbes partner Jonsey & is as likable as ever, Donald Sutherland makes an appearance as the boss Lieutenant Stanton in a largely insignificant role that seems to have been expanded because the filmmakers wanted to give him more screen time. Overall I thought Fallen was average at best, it's one of those films that I tend to describe as having nothing especially wrong with it but at the same time there is nothing particularly good about it either. Worth a watch for sure but just don't expect anything brilliant.",Fallen
12,Bunuel1976,"FALLEN (Gregory Hoblit, 1998) ***",7,17 November 2006,"Intriguing cop thriller on SEVEN (1995) lines but with supernatural overtones; this element, however, makes for a far-fetched and, ultimately, unconvincing plot - with the demon passing from one body to another merely through touch, which somehow renders him less threatening than he should be...and, in any case, he's seemingly bent solely on discrediting the hero (which makes his belated 'possession' of him all the more baffling)!; with this in mind, the film misleads one into thinking that the hero turns out to be an 'angel'! Still, Nicholas Kazan's script features enough twists to ensure an above-average show - and, for all its lack of the expected special effects (and for which one is actually grateful), the battle-of-wills between hero and villain (or, if you like, Man and The Devil) is certainly engaging and results in a few undeniably effective moments. The cast (Denzel Washington, John Goodman, Donald Sutherland, Embeth Davidtz, James Gandolfini) is pretty good, even if the performances are somewhat mannered i.e. you know you're watching actors rather than 'real' people. The climax is well done and also quite clever in its surprising identification of the narrator figure - even if the final, albeit amusing, twist feels like one too many trips to the well! All things considered, well worth watching.",Fallen
13,lastliberal,What are we here for? What do we do?,6,24 August 2007,"I have to rank this film up with the best of Denzel Washington. It's not one that I can watch over and over like Man on Fire, John Q, The Bone Collector or The mighty Quinn, but it is still an example of the excellent work that he has done throughout his career.If you believe in god, angels, and devils, then you will find the premise totally believable. Otherwise, it is an excellent horror film that supposedly explains evil in the world. It is never boring, as Emmy-winning director Gregory Hoblit (Hill Street Blues, NYPD Blue) keeps the pace up.With excellent support from such actors as Donald Sutherland, John Goodman, and James Gandolfini, it is an enjoyable experience.Check it out.",Fallen

Just pick up the movie and let it surprise you. It's like ""Identity"", the less you know about it, the better.Director Gregory Hoblit is a great and underrated director. He knows how to get the maximum out of everything. He also directed the movies ""Primal Fear"" and ""Frequency"" and much acclaimed television series episodes for ""Hill Street Blues"", ""L.A. Law"" and ""NYPD Blue"".Really great about the movie is the story by Nicholas Kazan (yes, indeed the son of...). It's supernatural but it still knows how to remain believable and realistic.

15,view_and_review,Who's Safe,6,5 November 2020,"In many ways this movie was depressing. It's about a fallen angel that can inhabit just about any body and cause the person to do evil then move on to the next person with a simple touch. A being like this is virtually unstoppable. What's to prevent him from killing again and again in different bodies thereby killing innocents and getting innocent people killed or imprisoned for life. There was no refuge from this hellish entity. Either he could occupy a body and do all kinds of harm, and for those he couldn't occupy by a touch he could kill at the hands of someone he has occupied.This being was called Azazel and it tried to inhabit Detective John Hobbes (Denzel Washington), but wasn't able to. Perhaps that's why he made Hobbes the object of his wicked games. Initially, Hobbes had no idea who or what he was pursuing. All he knew is that multiple murders were being committed and someone was contacting him leaving him the clues to those murders. It would take some digging for Hobbes to find out that he wasn't dealing with a mere mortal.Possession movies don't bother me, and this was a possession movie of a different sort. They can be delightfully scary. ""Fallen"" wasn't going for scary as much as it was going for suspense and thriller. I liked the suspense and intrigue, but I just couldn't get behind the idea of an omnipresent killer that can perpetually frame innocent people and can perpetually kill. It's hopelessness at its finest. On the one hand Azazel gives us a convenient explanation for all of the inhuman savagery that goes on in our world, but on the other hand it leaves us despondent as to one day bringing an end to all of the violence. You can't appeal to someone's human nature if they're not human and it didn't seem that exorcisms were going to be the way being that Azazel skipped from body to body much too fast. A formidable, even nearly undefeatable foe is good for a movie, but this one wasn't.",Fallen
16,anaconda-40658,Great Premise Falls!,5,28 April 2015,"Fallen (1998): Dir: Gregory Hoblit / Cast: Denzel Washington, John Goodman, Donald Sutherland, Embeth Davidtz, Elias Koteas: Good concept reduced to repetitious formula and a cheap payoff in a conclusion where it would appear that the adversary cannot be defeated. Denzel Washington plays a cop who captures a psychotic killer then watches him die in the gas chamber. The killer's soul inhabits other bodies simply by touch. Two great scenes result from this. One regards a song sung by the killer during his execution then he touches other cops with the song continuing simultaneously. The other involves a pursuit where the killer gains speed just by touching every person ahead. Washington is alarmed about a recorded message by the killer in a language he doesn't understand. Directed by Gregory Hoblit who has an idea but little to back it. He previously made Primal Fear, also about the lurking of evil. Washington is the only casting given anything to work with as he struggles to solve the case to a dead end. John Goodman, Donald Sutherland and Embeth Davidtz deteriorate rapidly with cardboard roles. Elias Koteas plays the bogeyman villain who goes from convict to a hellish pain in the ass. Well made thriller that falls short on what it might have been. Theme regards the ever present reality of evil within a screenplay that does just as its title says and hits rock bottom.

17,FlashCallahan,Time is on my side.....,6,7 July 2016,"Detective John Hobbes attends the execution of serial killer Edgar Reese. They have a private chat where Reese gives him a riddle of sorts and then speaks in a strange language. The riddle leads him to a once decorated officer who went to his cottage in the woods and killed himself. It was never explained why but when Hobbes looks around the cottage, he finds the name Azazel on the wall. Hobbes soon learns that Azazel is an evil spirit who can transfer itself from one person to another through touch. As Hobbes comes to realise the extent Azazel is responsible for much of the evil around him he also realises that Azazel is after him.......If you remember the Lou Diamond Phillips movie from 1990 The First Power, you will realise that this is nothing more than a remake of that movie, albeit with a higher calibre of acting on show, and all the camp jokes taken away in favour of straight up thrills.Washington is the Everyman police officer, and this was the point in his career when he was still having fun in his career, starring in more low budget B-movie fodder like this and Virtuoisty, rather than being more choosy like he has been in the last fifteen years (2 guns aside).And it's pretty good stuff, quite creepy in places, and there is one scene where Davidtz is being chased down the street by the Demon, but it looks more like an extreme game of tick/freeze-tag.There are a few questions that are unanswered that really irk the viewer, I really wish the his brothers character was fleshed out more, and the ending doesn't really make sense, why didn't he let him bleed slowly to death and run off?It's not a bad film though.",Fallen

One of the main reasons that I purchased the tape was because the film was filmed in Philadelphia, a great American city. Sadly, I didn't see much of the city as I thought. There are strange moments in the film like the people on the street passing an evil spirit from one to the other person. I was annoyed by the song ""Time on My Side"" by the Rolling Stones. It got too much after a while. The cast is first rate with Denzel Washington, John Goodman, Donald Sutherland, and Embeth Davidtz but the story appears to be weak. There are memorable moments in the film like seeing James Gandolfini in a supporting role before his Tony Soprano role the year later. Anyway, the film does have it's moments.

With ""Fallen"", it took a few days; mostly because the end credits left me with a lingering sadness. I don't think it's a spoiler to say that a particular family unit is left in ruins by film's end, and that was kind of a punch to the gut.But it is a good movie, and with time, I can see a future revisit. ""Fallen"" feels unexpected as a Denzel vehicle, but he does a god job as a logical police detective staring down a religious psycho-thriller. John Goodman gives solid support as his partner (just like he did for Al Pacino in ""Sea of Love""), same for Donald Sutherland in an almost-background police lieutenant role.There's a surprising eleventh-hour twist (a couple, actually) but the whole movie's worthwhile.",Fallen
20,whpratt1,Slightly Disappointed,7,24 June 2006,"This film sucked me in from the very beginning with its mysterious Spiritual theme which eventually becomes apparent. Denzel Washington,(Det.

John Goodman,(Det.Jonesy),""Beyond The Sea"",'04, is John Hobbes partner and adds a great deal of humor to his role, eating food most of the time. Donald Sutherland,(Lt. Stanton), ""Pride & Prejudice"",05 is not too happy about the way that Det. Jonesy and Hobbes are spending so much time on these cases.

21,MovieAddict2016,I've never understood the hostility towards this film,7,17 July 2006,"In my opinion ""Fallen"" is one of the better supernatural thrillers to come out of Hollywood in the past few decades. It's smart, slick and well-acted - not exploitative or full of ""shock"" material (gore-wise), but rather it operates on a more intellectual level.Denzel Washington and John Goodman are both superb as NYC cops who begin to believe a string of murders are being committed by a demon - the same demon that had earlier possessed a serial killer who was executed in the beginning of the film. As Washington investigates further he realizes this demon can jump from one person to the next (resulting in a rather eerie scene on a sidewalk in which the demon skips back and forth from each passerby). This may sound utterly silly, but the way it's filmed is what makes it effective.The ending is a shocker and the script by Nicholas Kazan (""Reversal of Fortune,"" ""Bicentennial Man"") offers decent dialogue.If you like atmospheric thrillers you should check this out.",Fallen

23,sddavis63,Flawed But Still Exciting,7,19 January 2003,"Denzel Washington offers his expected strong performance in a movie that, while not without weaknesses, is still quite watchable. Washington is Detective John Hobbes, who finds himself caught up in a supernatural murder investigation that leads him further and further into danger as he pursues a demon who can move from person to person, leading him to be suspicious of almost everyone. The story is interesting and imaginative, although the ""theology"" (such as it is) is extremely questionable at best. This is one of the primary weaknesses of the movie, along with the character of Gretta Milano (Embeth Davidtz), whose father died in suspicious circumstances that Hobbes believes to be connected to his current investigation. The problem is that the character of Gretta (who was supposed to be a theology teacher at a local college) was completely superfluous and added nothing to the story. Hobbes already had the thing basically figured out, and there isn't even a romance between the two (which I liked, by the way; I get tired of the required romances that Hollywood seems to feel are necessary to every movie.) The result is that the scenes involving Davidtz were - simply put - dull, because they weren't necessary. The other supporting cast members (John Goodman, Donald Sutherland, James Gandolfini) put on decent performances, although looking at Jonesy (Goodman) made me wonder if the local police in this unnamed city shouldn't have a weight requirement for their detectives!The end result is that while there's nothing particularly frightening here, there's a lot of suspense and in answer to the question that leads into the last scene of the movie (""do you remember that I told you ...?"") - actually, no I didn't, and that tied the beginning and ending together very nicely.
Overall, not a bad movie, although it could have been better.7/10",Fallen
24,gridoon,Too derivative.,6,4 May 2000,"""Fallen"" is an annoyingly derivative picture. It ""steals"" bits and pieces from all over the place, but mainly from ""The Hidden"" and Wes Craven's ""Shocker"". It lacks originality, and it also feels generally aimless and repetitive, since the whole concept doesn't go any further than a simple revenge story. The cast is full of familiar names, but they don't bring anything special to their characters here: Goodman and Sutherland are purely decorative. And this yet another movie where IF you KNOW that there is going to be a surprise ending, you MAY very well guess the ending by thinking that the improbable is probable in a horror film. On the positive side, ""Fallen"" is well-directed and absorbing, and the filmmakers deserve some credit for keeping us interested in a story as tired and unoriginal as this one (a demon that can possess the body of any person, until it becomes necessary to find a new body).",Fallen
25,sol1218,Evil has a Face,7,20 June 2005,"***SPOILERS*** Unusual thriller about evil in the world today with Det. John Hobbs, Denzel Washington, targeted by this unknown and unseen force that makes it's way from person to person with just the touch of one's hand. Doing a documentary on convicted serial murderer Reese, Elias Koteas, the person who's Det. Hobbs brilliant detective work brought him into the death house awaiting execution. Reese asks for just a brief moment with Det. Hobbs and surprisingly sticks his hand out for Det. Hobbs to shake, he does and that sets off a string of events. In the end they would leads Hobbs to the deserted cabin in the woods to have it out with the Demon Azazel who, through Reese, had condemned him to death. We see Let. Hobbs at the beginning of the movie ""Fallen"" crawling through the snow around the cabin that he was staying at obviously dying. The movie then takes us back to happier time with Det. Hobbs at the big house, state prison, attending Reese's execution as one of the witnesses. Reese not at all afraid of what's to happen to him as he's strapped into the state gas chamber calmly sings, as the gas pellets are dropped into the acid bath, the Rolling Stones song ""Time is on my Side"",yes it is. Let. Hobbs and his fellow cops later saw in the film Reese was right, dead right. The movie ""Fallen"" mixes the occult into a big city police drama and comes out a winner by doing it. Det. Hobbs slowly begins to notices that there's something very strange in what's happening to him. At first Hobbs feels that he's being set up to be framed, possibly by his fellow policemen, for a number of murders that has his fingerprints all over the crime scene.Hobbs tracking down a clue that leads him to unearth the files of a cop Robert Milano, the 1965 cop of the year, who like himself was somehow framed for a string of killings back in the 1960's. Milano in what seemed like, an act of depression drove out to his country home and then calmly blew his brains out. Getting in touch with the late Officer Malano's daughter Gretta, Embeth Davidzt, Hobbs finds out from her things that he'd rather not since, if believed by him, it will destroys his perception of reality. It doesn't take Hobbs that long to realize how right Gretta is with the evil directed at him,that was released by Reese, and later his family with his brother Art, Gabriel Casseus, ending up dead from a overdose of drugs. Hobbs now a rue believer knows just what he had to do to stop this sinister force that's been on earth together with man since the dawn of creation.Hobbs now a wanted man drives to the same cabin where Officer Malano killed himself some thirty years ago to finish the job that Malano started.There was a reason for Malano's madness but in the end he failed in what he set out to do then, destroy the evil demon Azazel. Hobbs made sure that this time around he, unlike Malano, would succeed.Powerhouse ending that will leave you as exhausted and out of breath as it did Det. Hobbs when the evil that hounded him throughout the film ""Fallen"" finally reveals itself in those cold lonely and uninhabited woods. Only to find out that he,Hobbs, not it had the best hand of cards from what it, the evil, thought was a stacked deck against him.",Fallen

27,g-bodyl,Offers Up Some Cheap Thrills And Chills!,8,1 June 2014,"Fallen seems to be a little-known supernatural thriller that is often entertaining and sometimes a little chilling. I'm not a huge horror fanatic, but this is the kind of horror I like. Less CGI and blood, a more realistic setting. This film may be a little confusing and the pace differentiates from time to time, but not a bad supernatural flick if you're looking for realistic chills.Gregory Hoblit's film is about a detective named John Hobbes who figures once this serial killer is executed, his troubles would be over. But they are far from over as he figures out demons exist and they can travel from body to body and now Hobbes must enter battle with this Azazel if he wants to live.I'm a huge Denzel Washington fan, but I'm surprised I didn't hear much about this film. He does a good job as Hobbes, though admittedly this is not his best role. John Goodman, in one of his rare non-comedy roles is convincing as Hobbe's partner, Jonesy. Donald Sutherland does a rather good job as lieutenant of the police force.Overall, Fallen is a decent supernatural horror film and with the great cast, I'm surprised more people haven't heard of this film. It goes easy on the CGI effects, which is nice for once. If you're a Rolling Stones fan, watch out because time may not be on your side. This is nothing special, but it's a serviceable thriller. I rate this film 8/10.",Fallen
28,secondtake,"Great acting, fun twist to the plot, well filmed",7,10 June 2014,"Fallen (1998)Half detective, half supernatural thriller, this movie really moves. It's clever but not preposterous, and Denzel Washington anchors the whole things with his smiling believability. This is a good one. And the rest of the cast is fabulous, from John Goodman to Donald Sutherland. The one woman is the convincing Embeth Davidtz, and there is a small role even for the late James Gandolfini.The plot seems straight up at first, as Denzel's character, Hobbes, looks for a murderer who seems to become a serial murderer. This morphs slowly into a a supernatural evil force inhabiting people and making them bad. This grows without a sense of shock so that there is a logic gradually built up.And the target of this evilness seems to be Hobbes, though we never quite know why. (He catches bad guys and one of them is executed at the start, but the spirit shouldn't have been bothered by this.) Hobbes of course feels that the crimes don't make sense, and his encounter with Davidtz's character, who studies angels and spirits, is a turning point.There are of course hundreds of horror films with similar kinds of plots, and what makes this one rise above most of them is how well made it is. Credit here goes beyond Washington, though he's clearly key. The cinematographer, Newton Thomas Sigel, is excellent (he also shot ""Three Kings"" and ""Drive"") and the coherence of the complex movie is partly because of a consistent visual flow.Director Gregory Hoblit is mostly a TV guy, but around the time of this movie he made a few others with similar success, including ""Fracture"" which is quite good in the same solid way and ""Primal Fear"" which has a terrific performance by Edward Norton.""Fallen"" does come out of a familiar mold, and that is one reason why it is satisfying (many of us know we like this kind of film) and also limited ultimately (it isn't completely fresh, after all). I suspect nearly everyone will like aspects of this, even if the most demanding viewer will groan at some of the clichés. The acting alone rises up in so many cases, the rest is easy to really like.",Fallen
29,The-Sarkologist,"A Very Interesting Twist, but not really my type of film",5,27 January 2012,"This movie is almost identical in plot to The First Power. One of the main differences is that the antagonist in The First Power was a powerful human, while Azazel in Fallen is a demon. Basically, they both possess bodies and turn them against the hero. In The First Power, the antagonist can really only change bodies by killing the first and then, once free, inhabiting the next. Azazel can pass bodies by simply touching, though there are some who he cannot possess simply by touching.The idea is that when the angels rebelled, some were cast out and denied bodies, so they survive by possessing people (and animals) and if they are out of a body for too long then they die. Thus there is only one way to defeat it. Isolated the possessed body from anybody else and kill the body. This is much difficult than it sounds, especially since nobody really believes in them anyway.I really found this movie to be quite long and boring. Okay, the antagonist was okay, taunting the hero constantly, and there is an interesting twist at the end, but other than that, the movie doesn't really stand out all that much. Basically, the movie opens with a voice saying, ""I'll tell you about the time that I almost died."" And we see the hero crawling through the snow. Thus we are led to assume that the hero is the one telling the story.The movie is narrated, and as far as we can tell, it is the hero as it is his voice and it seems to focus on him. Thus, in that way it is quite good, but otherwise the movie is just plain average.",Fallen

32,zkonedog,"Lacked Plot, Character Development, and Passion",3,11 March 2017,"As a fan of the passionate acting of Denzel Washington, I recently stumbled upon this film (I was surprised to find a Denzel performance I had not seen yet!) at the local video store. Though Mr. Washington usually enthralls me in his various film efforts, ""Fallen"" just fell flat and never seemed to get off the ground or lead anywhere.The basic plot involves Washington (playing a cop) being haunted by the spirit of a former inmate whom he sentenced to the death penalty years before. This spirit (which is supposed to be a sort of ""devil incarnate"") can move from person to person in the slightest of body contact, making it incredibly difficult to track down.As I began watching and the plot unfolded, I kept expecting to see one of two (or, best case scenario, both!) things transpire: First, I wanted to know more about the origins of this devil- spirit. Second, I wanted to really see how the spirit would throw Denzel's character for a loop and make him re-evaluate his faith and priorities in life. Sadly, neither of those tangents were even partially realized.The spirit isn't treated any differently than a real-life murderer in any number of cop dramas, and Washington's character is so ""by the book"" that his personal life really isn't touched on at all. Also, because of those two deficiencies, Washington is not able to do what (at least I feel) he does best as an actor: emote wildly and with passion. His character in this film is written as much too serious to do such a thing.Thus, upon the film's conclusion, I was left feeling disappointed, with the thought that this film was potentially heading towards something much greater but never really realized that potential. You may better enjoy the movie if you are a fan of strict, by-the-book cop flicks, but otherwise avoid at the risk of feeling let-down.",Fallen
33,filipemanuelneto,"A ""one-man movie"".",8,28 March 2017,"This film shows the fight of an honest, incorruptible and fair cop against an entity he is not prepared for: a demon. Okay, it's a variation of the traditional films of exorcists and demons that reminds us ""The End of Days"", without that ""end of the world"" thing. The script is good and works, developing a strong and appealing story without, however, becoming really scary. Its a script where logic is sometimes contradicted, beginning with the way demons are transformed into bodyless beings, who can take any living being in order to survive. This goes against everything we've learned about demons but I'm willing to ignore that. Its a minor fault. The demon this movie shows worked very well for the movie and that's what matters. The pace is good, not wasting time unnecessarily. The plot twists give elegance to the story, but they cannot really surprise. Only in the end.The cast have some stars like Denzel Washington, John Goodman, Donald Sutherland, Embeth Davidtz and James Gandolfini, but its Denzel who stands out all the time, carrying the film on his back. In fact, given the disembodied nature of the villain, its almost a ""one-man movie"".

35,videorama-759-859391,Koteas versus Wasington in SK film that keeps falling and failing,6,7 April 2015,"To me Fallen was just a lot of puff. After the execution of a serial killer (Koteas-one of my favorite actors, a wild card, again making a meal out of his role) he leaves Detective John Hobbes (Washington) with a line of dire warning, and he's true to his words. After his passing, and a great killer line, a request if you will from Koteas, who was an avid admirer of Hobbs, though of course, not reciprocated, the same style of killings begin again. Now we venture into the world of the supernatural, and the why's as we look for a picture, then another big picture, another reason, then another reason, the story stringing us along successfully, in a want to know, why some New York city folk, strangers are acting creepy, towards Hobbes. And they're not just strangers, they're people in his unit. Hobbes is also seeing things, where the touch of one hand to another reaches Hobbes. Is it Koteas's spirit? The movie really puts too much into it, layer upon layer, as if to explain or keep the plot interesting while progressing the story more, ridiculously defending what we can't buy, every time, where in the end what ensues isn't earth shattering, but just ridiculous, more puff. The performances by all are good, James Gandofini for one, and Penelope Ann Miller, is it, who knows a lot about demons, and the church. She assists Hobbes to try and fight this spirit and properly rid Koteas of the universe for all. Fallen just joins those serial killer films of lower status or misfires, e.g, In Dreams, or the ridiculous Twisted, yet still the story does reel you in, having us wanting to know the truth behind's Hobbes's suffering. You won't suffer much during the film, but there will be some trying moments. Check out Mick Jagger's Time Is On Our Side song accompanied by a shouting and screaming Koteas, as he's led towards his doom.",Fallen
36,FiendishDramaturgy,Mind-blowing supernatural/psycho-thriller,9,17 September 2003,"Frankly, I go more for supernatural thrillers than for psychological ones. Although I love a good ""Who Dunnit,"" mind games just aren't my favorite things to watch on film. However. This one is one of the best mixes of psychological AND supernatural genres of horror I've ever seen.I am amazed at the creative perpetration of such a complicated plot, sub plots, and extremely deep and well developed characters.The narrative is completely explanatory, filling in any blanks the direction may have left in its attempt to stay within budget. The acting quality is superb and great attention has been paid to the scenery, settings and prop details. The dialog is good and strong, and the narrative is not only thought-provoking, but some of the pearls of wisdom shared are truly eye-opening if you are open minded enough to allow that sort of thing.The filmography and cinematography of this move are exemplary.This movie all around just soars above other movies which have attempted this device.While other critics have compared this movie to ""Seven,"" this production is uniquely written, directed and portrayed. The only real similarity I found in the two are the darkly ""christian"" sub-texts and interpretations of the deeds done. I find it to be the veritable ""breath of fresh air"" one needs in order to keep stagnation and ""creativity block"" at bay.This unique and creative story line is quirky, imaginative and twisty.It defies your imagination and demands that you use it. Those who do not ""understand the plot,"" of this movie, simply do not possess the intelligence and creativity to think outside a dogmatic upbringing.John Goodman is very likable and believable as Jonesy, John Hobbes's (Denzell Washington's) partner. As they puzzle together the clues and begin to put together the pieces of a picture to which they can't yet even begin to see the outline, their characters and the working relationship between them become well defined and developed early on in the movie.The plot and story move right along, with no slow spots and no waste of film. What seems in the beginning to be a lull in the movie, actually gives you so many details you need in solving and understanding the ""bigger picture,"" that if you allow yourself not to pay attention to those scenes, you will not be able to follow the movie later.This is definitely one of those movies you have to WATCH. You can't just view it while you're doing other things, and still get anything from the movie. Take the almost 2 hours away from your busy schedule and let Denzell Washington entertain you, SCARE you, and maybe even make you think of other possibilities in this world.""Sometimes, I think the basic job that human beings have, is just to figure out what the hell is going on?"" John Hobbes.Ignore the religious undertones, sit back and enjoy it.As the pieces begin to go into place, the puzzle gets even more complicated. This is where the intricate sub-plots begin to come into play. It's amazing how Gregory Hoblit (Hill Street Blues, NYPD Blue, and LA Law among others) keeps the story and plot separate and yet coherently brings them together without losing track of what is happening. Absolutely brilliant.One of the main things I enjoyed was experiencing the bond between Hobbes and his mentally-challenged brother Art (Gabriel Casseus) and his nephew Sam (Michael J. Pagan). I appreciated the loving way Hobbes dealt with them both, even in times of crisis.""There are moments which mark your life; moments when you realize nothing will ever be the same, and time is divided into two parts: before This and after This."" John Hobbes.I found the narrative to be very intelligent and inspiring. Narrated by Denzell Washington in a cool, even voice.The scene inside the station house where the Fallen begins to interrogate Hobbes's character and then moves out into the street, again and again...is one of the most compelling psychologically freakish scenes I've ever experienced. It really, honestly spun me out. As one of the most memorable scenes of the movie, it goes into the Horror Hall of Fame along with the ""Redrum"" and the ""Heeeeere's Johnny!"" scenes of Kubrick's adaptation of ""The Shining,"" for originality and outright freakishness.While most of the ""scary"" scenes of this movie are suspense, there are some out right ""scare you"" moments.All in all, I have to say this movie is by far a most excellent and entertaining movie all the way around.This production also contains a good, strong and believable performance by Donald Sutherland as Hobbes's Captain. I still love Sutherland's performances from the ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" days. I've never seen him portray a character poorly.He's definitely one of the greats. While I haven't liked every movie he's done, I've always enjoyed watching a real professional actor at work.I also have to say the same thing about Denzell Washington.While I've not always liked his movies, I've always enjoyed his roles and performances.This is one of my favorite thrillers and by merit of quality, originality and creativity, it rates a 9.4/10 from...the Fiend :.",Fallen

In ""Training Day"" you played a cop, but you played a villain cop that was so evil that you made us all hate you! You turned ""Malcolm X"" into a great movie despite Spike Lee's involvement!

Again he's the clever and wise detective, but this time the movie has a creepy and delightfully fun supernatural twist...Plus it was made when Denzel was still acting and not just phoning it in, so, you know, you have the REAL Denzel Washington, not the made-for-TV Denzel Washington.And on top of the fact that this was made when Denzel was great and still actually acting, you have a small but powerful Elias Koteas role.Elias Koteas the B-list actor that ALWAYS brings his A-game to every film no matter how small the role is. And in this movie, the role is tiny and so well done that you walk away remembering that tiny little role as powerful, as fantastic, as, well, A-game awesome.Koteas literally outshined Washington when Washington was at his finest. He introduced us to the film and set a bar so high that everyone was forced to deliver their best work.And then the plot, the creepy demon that can jump from body-to-body by a simple touch. You haven't seen that before and you won't see that again.

Can't beat the 90's for the Thriller Genre.,9,15 May 2021,"Denzel Washington is like the king of Thriller's!!!I love 90's films, especially from the Thriller Genre & Denzel was like the master of that genre.Denzel is a guy we all grew up watching & makes such high calibre & exciting Thriller's & has done so since the 90's & one of his best is the supernatural Detective mystery Thriller ""Fallen"" a tale about a homicide Detective John Hobbes (Washington) who put away a sadistic serial killer, played by the excellent Elias Koteas, who is put to death but somehow keeps on killing & tormenting Hobbes from beyond the grave.That's the setup for this excellent & atmospheric Detective mystery that is drenched in supernatural happenings & demonic mythology. A demonic spirit that came from the executed killer is possessing random people & continuing his murder pattern & Hobbes is his target.Denzel is excellent as the smart & in control Hobbes & shows why we love him as the cool leading man he is. It was so cool seeing Denzel play a cop in a Horror type of film, well it's more a supernatural Thriller but it definitely has alot of Horror mixed into it. The look of this flick is beautifully creepy & cozy at the same time. The comfort comes from Denzel's Hobbes as he goes about his investigation & we get some lovely scenes of the pouring down rain as he sits at his desk in his dimly lit police department & gives a really nice Detective Noir feel. The creepiness comes from the randomness of the demon changing from anyone it touches. There's also a fantastic supporting cast of greats such as John Goodman as Hobbes best friend & years long partner on the force, Jones. Goodman is great in his role & plays the sluggish slob type cop perfectly & has a sense of humour too. The great James Gandolfini (R. I. P) is equally great another Detective who works alongside Hobbes & Jones. Gandolfini has that sly smurk does so well & is a sarcastic guy. Also the veteran Donald Sutherland plays the head of the department & puts in a solid performance. A great bunch of actors that make ""Fallen"" a high quality movie.The music is great too & definitely gives the film a real old school Detective vibe. The look & cinematography is beautiful throughout with it's chilly autumn setting & dark days full of rain coming down the windows of the police department & plenty of shadows & dim lights, the movie i pure Detective Noir in style & so suits Denzel in this environment.I liked the Demon mythology & all the investigation stuff that Hobbes does & Denzel really is great as Hobbes & as one of the greatest leading men & actors in Cinema history.Fallen is a cracking cop Thriller with an excellent Denzel Washington on top 90's form.",Fallen
39,NateWatchesCoolMovies,Excellent atmospheric chiller,9,24 June 2015,"As far as the sub genre of supernaturally tinged detective vs. Killer mysteries of the 1990's,(Virtuosity, The Prophecy, In  Dreams etc) Gregory Hoblit's Fallen stands out as one of the best. It's a somber, sardonically written, Gothic influenced chiller that is absolute cinematic joy from beginning to end. Denzel Washington is reliably solid as John Hobbes, a sharp detective who's caught a vicious killer Edgar Reese (Elias Koteas in a cameo so scary you want to hide behind your couch), and oversees his execution. Reese's casually cavalier attitude and malevolent theatrics leading up to the execution unsettle Hobbes, but not as much as when an eerily similar copycat killer begins taunting him long after Reese's death. Enigmatic clues, visits from strangers who mysteriously know him and a sense of impending dread lead Hobbes to believe that Reese wasn't human, and is reaching out from beyond the grave to continue his murderous legacy. The plot gets spiritually ethereal and uses some very unique situational scares that are highly memorable. The colour palate and mood of the film are absolutely gorgeous, using a gauzy, earth toned,  fluttering brown moth wing style aesthetic that haunts the characters, and a darkly humorous screenplay that gives the actors dialogue and character feasts. John Goodman and James Gandolfini are fantastic as Hobbes's detective colleagues. Embeth Davidzt is down to earth and human as a mythological expert with secrets of her own, and other memorable support is provided by Robert Joy, Gabriel Casseus and Donald Sutherland. There are an endless parade of cop vs. serial killer films in the post 70's all the way to present day. Some pedestrian, some with lofty twists on the convention. Some work splendidly, some are crap. But in a sub genre so crowded with entries, you need to give yours a special brand and aesthetic that will make your effort stick in people's minds as something unique. Fallen succeeds very well in this way, and is a spine chilling popcorn flick with a grounded, serious undercurrent of shadowy, haunted house stylistics. Highly recommended.",Fallen
40,valleyjohn,Demon tag,6,5 February 2021,"I'm of the opinion that Denzel Washington is one of those very rare actors that never makes a bad film .
He has a canny knack of picking good scripts . Once in a while his films turn out to be just average and Fallen is one such film .Homicide detective John Hobbes witnesses the execution of serial killer Edgar Reese. Soon after the execution, the killings start again, and they are very similar to Reese's style.
While this is still very watchable the storyline is pretty stupid .
I saw it described as an Omen-esq film and that couldn't be further from the truth .
The Omen is one of the greatest horror films of all time , Fallen is like a stupid game of demon tag !The problem with this is that it's a cop thriller / Horror Crossover and like so often with crossover films it turns out to be neither .There are some good performances from Washington, John Goodman and Elias Koreas and some not so good from James Gandolfini and Donald Sutherland .Fallen is a couple of hours of corny entertainment but ultimately, like it's title , it falls short of a good movie.",Fallen

It has a good solid central story, but it's told in the wrong manner. Maybe with a veteran director behind the camera this could've been a big hit with rave reviews, but unfortunately that's not the case. Fallen suffers from too much exposition and too many silly plot holes to make it stand above the crowd. It's a really good idea that's not brought to its full potential. I don't think it deserves negative reviews, just neutral ones, it's by no means a bad film, it just doesn't quite hit the mark it so desperately wants to, but with an underdeveloped script and a villain that never truly reaches full menace, Fallen just isn't quite good enough to stand with the elites of the police procedural genre.",Fallen

Both of those films had outstanding directors: Alan J. Pakula and Philip Noyce who both have many excellent films to their credit. ""The Pelican Brief"" was written by John Grisham and best of all, you have Julia Roberts (at her Hollywood peak) in the lead role. In ""The Bone Collector"", Denzel Washington's co-star is Angelina Jolie, a star on the rise.",Fallen
44,winner55,ending ruins film,5,12 January 2008,"Strong performances from Washington Goodman, Southerland, and all supporting actors; tight story mixing elements of serial killer films and demon possession films; solid visuals, sometimes brilliantly executed in photography and editing - yet I can't recommend the film.What a stupid final sequence! We all know the evil spirit here needs a HUMAN - but all I can tell you is, the writers don't deliver it; the betray us - they go for the expected B-Movie open-ended closure, which turns the whole theme of the movie into trashy prologue - a real insult.This decision also weakens the dialog - you expect pearls to pop out of the mouths of these great actors - then suddenly, we hear the same-old same-old cliché we could expect from many weaker stories.Hollywood again cuts its own wrists and we have to watch it bleed - and then they expect us to lap it up?! Please! For arrogance unbecoming of film-makers, I rate this a five - lower than its professionalism deserves, but higher that it's insulting pandering is worth.",Fallen
45,philip_vanderveken,"This movie depends on a good story and some very nice acting, not on spectacular scenes",8,30 June 2005,"A good movie with an interesting mystical atmosphere and some decent acting, you'll not find that too often. Most of the time the directors try too hard, spoiling everything and making me loose all interest after about 30 minutes. This time however, it was a completely different case. Gregory Hoblit, the man who also made the interesting movie ""Primal Fear"", but who hasn't made many movies since, has done a good job with an interesting story and some very good actors...""Fallen"" starts with the execution of the serial killer Edgar Reese. Now that Detective John Hobbes knows that the man is dead, he's convinced that all his troubles are over. But when people get killed by someone who uses the same method Reese once used and several people he knows and people on the street, start to sing the same tune that Reese sang in the gas chamber,... he knows something is wrong. As Hobbes follows up the last clues Reese left, an evil presence called Azazel, moves from one person to another, coming closer to Hobbes and threatening everyone he holds dear in the world...I know all this may sound rather unbelievable. A fallen angel, praying on an honest cop, does indeed seem a bit too far-fetched and typically Hollywood, but what is more important this time is that it all works. I was interested from the beginning until the end, not only thanks to the story, but also thanks to the very good acting by Denzel Washington, Donald Sutherland, James Gandolfini and (the in my opinion underrated) John Goodman. They were the real stars in this movie and they made it all work, but it was Elias Koteas who stole the show with his short appearance as Edgar Reese.Of course many people will be disappointed by the lack of any big and spectacular action scenes. If you are looking for that in a movie, than you better leave this one alone. This movie doesn't really use any special effects or big explosions, it almost entirely depends on the acting and the storyline, although the direction and the way this movie was shot give it something extra too. Overall this movie certainly deserves to be seen by a larger public, especially when they are interested in thrillers with the presence of evil and demons as a subject. I liked it and that's why I give it a 7.5/10.",Fallen
46,Luigi Di Pilla,Disappointing,5,22 March 2006,I bought this DVD many years ago and today I have to admit that the story is not a clever horror thriller because it's soon predictable and it is too long. Then it tries to mix some intriguing scenes but it fails completely showing all the time the same things and after an hour I had enough and stopped this disappointing thriller. It begins promisingly but after many efforts to create a chilling atmosphere for the audience it let me absolutely cool. Denzel Washington and Donald Sutherland played as usual solid roles but they couldn't save it from this mess. For all that reasons I give with my wife a vote of 5/10. I highly recommend therefore the supernatural thriller THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES with Richard Gere that is inspired at least on true events and that I watched already twice.,Fallen

51,oneguyrambling,"A bigger budget, bigger name version of The First Power. Not a bad replica.",6,3 February 2012,"Someone saw The First Power a couple decades back and thought ""Gee if you throw a 'Name' actor in the mix and some hooky stuff and you've got a hit!"".Well not so fast Chief, I'm not sure how profitable Fallen was but at least it is a pretty good serial killer flick with distinct supernatural and theological undertones.Detective John Hobbes (Denzel Washington) inhabits the Lou Diamond Phillips role. He too is an expert in identifying and tracking down serial killers, he too is celebrating a great 'get' in the form of Reese (Elias Koteas), an especially heinous individual who took great delight in taunting his pursuers, often calling Hobbes at home just as a tease.Even in captivity Reese is still cocky and brash, citing using obscure references harking back to eras long since past to bait and bait Hobbes in foreign tongues all the way up until his execution. Well that's that then.Not really. Shortly after the execution a new killer appears, one that seems to be mimicking Reeses' modus operandi all the way down to the late night phone calls to Hobbes' home that he shared with his brother and nephew. Hobbes and his detective colleagues Jones (John Goodman) and Lou (James Gandolfini) jump on the case, with Stanton (Donald Sutherland) overseeing the precinct.Hobbes follows the trail closely, all the way back to a murder case over thirty years old with startling parallels to the present day. This leads him to Greta (Embeth Davitz) the daughter of a cop implicated in the old case, who warns Hobbes off the entire thing, telling him to stay away for the benefit of his family and everyone he knows.But that would mean half a film, so Hobbes doggedly continues on, at certain locations he seems to receive messages – directions almost – that impel him forward, seemingly closer to uncovering the truth Which is where the supernatural elements kick in, elements that I have deliberately not mentioned here as half the fun is in discovering them. Denzel is solid as always in the central role, remaining stoic and professional even in the face of mounting evidence that he is facing a foe that is decidedly 'other'.The supporting cast are all fine in their roles – Koteas standing out in a role that demands he play things over the top – and even as the situation grows tighter and more desperate the filmmakers manage to keep the tone straight and as realistic as the plot line allows.I liked Fallen, it was very effective in building tension in a few early sequences as the truth is gradually drip fed to you, and the finale was quite good, especially considering that the film began to lose steam in the second third of the film.Was it necessary to make practically the same film as The First Power only with a bigger budget and Denzel to lend credibility and box office clout? No. Is it better or more memorable than The First Power? Not really. Is it worth a look? Yep. Especially if you were one of the few who actually liked The First Power. If you've never heard of it and liked this, look it up.Final Rating – 6.5 / 10. Touchy feely strangers singing Rolling Stones songs would be strange and disturbing if you weren't in the midst of a murder case. Here they just cap things off.",Fallen
52,seymourblack-1,Detective & Demon In Deadly Dual,8,18 November 2015,"Shortly after thinking that he'd brought an end to a series of murders, a homicide detective starts to realise that the perpetrator is still at large and is also someone who couldn't possibly be arrested or brought to justice by conventional methods. The way in which his investigation leads him to these findings and the formulation of a highly unconventional plan to end the killings, provides ""Fallen"" with its extremely offbeat plot. This well-written story begins very colourfully in a way that raises a lot of questions and then proceeds through the investigation stage before reaching it brilliantly twisted conclusion.Having been responsible for capturing serial killer Edgar Reese (Elias Koteas), Detective John Hobbes (Denzel Washington) visits him on death row immediately prior to his execution. Reese's behaviour at this time is rather strange as he thrusts his hand out strongly to shake hands with Hobbes and sets him a riddle to solve. He then talks loudly in ancient Syrian Aramaic and later, in the gas chamber, loudly sings ""Time Is On My Side"" until he can't anymore.A little while later, Hobbes has to investigate a further series of murders which are carried out in the same style as those committed by Reese and a clue he finds at one of the crime scenes leads him to research the case of a well-respected detective from his department who, 30 years earlier, had committed suicide at a remote woodland cabin after being accused of crimes he didn't commit. Hobbes' research leads him to the detective's daughter, Gretta Milano (Embeth Davidtz) who's a theology professor. She's initially very reluctant to talk but confirms that her father took his own life because of incriminating evidence against him which he felt he wouldn't be able to disprove.When Hobbes visits the cabin where Milano had killed himself, he finds the name ""Azazel"" written on one of the walls and Gretta later confirms that it refers to a fallen angel who, after being cast out of heaven, had been made formless as a punishment and could only continue to exist in the bodies of others. The demon's ability to pass from body to body simply by touch made it extremely dangerous and impossible to stop. Hobbes begins to realise that he's actually in a dual against a very formidable adversary who's determined to destroy him and so, when evidence starts to appear which implicates Hobbes in the murders he's investigating, he knows that he's rapidly being put in the same situation that detective Milano had been in and so devises a scheme to outwit the demon and bring a permanent end to the havoc he wreaks.Denzel Washington is very natural and believable as the decent detective who has never taken a bribe in his career and believes that cops are ""the chosen people"". This extremely rational man remains typically methodical and professional as he pursues what turns out to be a supernatural serial killer and is confident that his approach will eventually enable him to put a stop to the demon's killing spree. John Goodman, James Gandolfini and Donald Sutherland all do well as Hobbes' police colleagues and Elias Koteas makes a powerful impression in his role which gives him tremendous scope to display his abilities.Thrillers which include the type of subject matter featured in ""Fallen"" often resort to sensationalism, gratuitous violence and endings that use some previously unknown piece of information to bring matters to a close. The fact that ""Fallen"" avoids all these pitfalls is very much to its credit, especially as its brilliantly twisted conclusion follows on perfectly from all that preceded it and puts an entirely different perspective on what appeared to happen in the movie's opening scenes.",Fallen

Although the plots are not identical, the themes are very similar. Hate to be so obtuse, but previous reviewers are indeed correct: the less you know about this movie, the more you'll enjoy the creeping dread and the great little shocks it has to offer, leading up to a surprising ending.Note: I said surprising, not necessarily satisfying. Gorehounds and lovers of graphic, red-dyed-Karo-syrup-all-over-the-walls violence should definitely look elsewhere. Some very nice performances from the entire cast, but I have to single out John Goodman and the underrated Elias Koteas.

58,ajs-10,An underrated Horror/Thriller (IMO)...,8,30 October 2011,"I have seen this film before and pretty much enjoyed it. Noticing it in the TV schedules recently, I thought I'd give it another go and put some thoughts down about it this time. A film that is not widely hailed as a horror film, I found it both atmospheric and quite menacing. To me a good horror film pays on the audiences' fear of the unknown, and this film does just that. I'll tell you more after this brief summary.When serial killer, Edgar Reese, is about to be executed, he asks to speak to the detective that caught him, John Hobbes. Gloating at Hobbes, he begins to speak in some foreign language and finally bursts into song; The Rolling Stones, 'Time is on my Side'. Thinking nothing of this, Hobbes proceeds to witness the execution, but it's not the last he'll see of Edgar Reese, or is it Edgar Reese? A day later Hobbes is called to the scene of a murder, a murder that has all the hallmarks of Edgar Reese. Does he have an accomplice, or is there a copycat out there? Either way, it's a puzzle that has to be solved and one that will lead Hobbes and his partner, Jonesy, down a very perilous path. I won't say any more or the Spoiler Police (demonic branch) will be possessing my family and turning them against me.A well made film with a very interesting narration and a delightful twist at the end. Great performances all round, especially from Denzel Washington as John Hobbes, John Goodman as Jonesy and Embeth Davidtz as Gretta Milano. Honourable mentions go to Donald Sutherland as Lt. Stanton and James Gandolfini (with an outrageous moustache) as Lou.I very much enjoyed this film although it did fall a little flat about two thirds of the way through and I did find it a little over-long. Other than that I found it quite an intelligent film that keeps you guessing right until the end. It's one that will be overlooked by many (low gore factor), but one I would encourage any horror fan to watch. It has quite a slow pace, but don't be deceived, it's quite enthralling if you give it a chance Recommended.My Score: 7.6/10.IMDb Score: 6.8/10 (based on 30,255 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes Score: 40/100 (based on 55 reviews counted at the time of going to press).",Fallen

I don't think that this movie is scary . Gregory Hoblit does a fine job with the film.In spite of the fact that one knows what is going on for a good half-hour before the detective hero clicks on, both Hoblit and the script unfold these revelations with a decent degree of tension and suspense. There is also a beautifully written twist ending – the first one has ever seen that manages to so twist first-person voice-over completely on its head. Denzel Washington is good as always . He portrayed the transformation from cool and confident cop into frightened prey very convincingly. Elias Koteas is having fun with his role, even if it's a small one. Donald Sutherland doesn't put a lot of effort into his role , but he's still nice . James Gandolfini makes appearance , but the movie somehow forgets about him in the final minutes. I wasn't sure about John Goodman in the role of cop. Surprisingly it doesn't come out as a comic relief . He does have few nice jokes , yet is role is serious and he gets a chance to shine.It's a nice touch from the movie makers that ""Sympathy for the devil"" by Rolling Stones is a recurring theme . It adds an ironic distance to whole story.Not bad movie worth recommendation for both horror and thriller movie fans. Not really rewatchable , I do however recommend to watch it once.

60,Libretio,Routine thriller with an unusual premise,4,21 February 2000,"FALLEN Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Panavision)Sound formats: Dolby Digital / DTS / SDDSGregory Hoblit's FALLEN is a routine thriller with an unusual premise. Denzel Washington plays a workaday cop who's pursued by a fallen angel which takes possession of its victim's bodies simply by touching them. The potential for greatness is realised only fleetingly: The multiple possession which takes place in front of Washington at police HQ; the moment he's forced to kill an innocent man to save his own life; and the deeply cynical final twist which may leave some viewers with a rotten taste in the mouth. Otherwise, the film isn't terribly engaging. The villain is depicted as an ethereal presence which fails to generate any sense of real menace at all. In fact, Washington is the whole show here, and he's suitably earnest, but he seems to be cruising on autopilot, and John Goodman is largely wasted as his detective-partner. The emphasis on characterisation yields some interesting results (Washington's caring relationship with his mentally-handicapped brother is a particular highlight), but the film doesn't have the guts to RUN with its outrageous premise. A little less pandering to Washington's star status and a little more outright horror could have made all the difference.",Fallen

62,skepticskeptical,A metaphorical treatment of moral corruption,8,23 June 2015,"Fallen can be viewed as a straight-out supernatural thriller, in which case it may not seem to be as good as others in the genre. However, the real value of this production is found when the entire text is considered metaphorically, at which point it emerges that the ""demon"" moving from one person to another represents the causal mechanism of moral corruption in disguise. People are corrupted by other corrupt people, and the chain of corruption is lengthened over time as more and more people are persuaded to sacrifice their beliefs and principles for those of others who wish to capitalize upon their weakness.I found this film quite thought provoking, and I dislike supernatural thrillers in general. For that reason, I'd say that people who favor the genre may not like this movie, though they may. The people who praise this film are obviously digging beneath the surface.",Fallen

Then it could have been a lot more engrossing, not to mention frightening. As it is, ""Fallen"" has its moments, but overall it's unrealized potential.Detective John Hobbes (Denzel Washington) has just witnessed the execution of serial killer Edgar Reese (Elias Koteas in a genuinely off the wall performance). But soon after, bodies start piling up, and the M.O. is distinctively like Reese's.When the film starts getting into the real story (which I haven't even hinted at) its a genuinely fascinating premise. It's not that the script doesn't explore the possibilities opened by it, it's that director Gregory Hoblit can't generate much tension from the material. His approach is cold and clinical. While ""Fallen"" is always interesting and never boring, it's also not particularly involving.The actors are part of the problem. No one really does anything interesting with their character. Granted, no one is especially unique on paper (save for Edgar Reese), but these are professional actors who have demonstrated in the past that they can act. Denzel Washington has won two Oscars (although only one at the time of filming), Donald Sutherland should be right at home in this kind of movie, Embeth Davidtz provided an emotional anchor in ""Schindler's List,"" and John Goodman displays more range than anyone really gives him credit for. But acting wise, everyone except for Elias Koteas (who is a delight to watch, despite having less than ten minutes total of screen time), approaches their parts in a straightforward manner.There are a few creepy moments in ""Fallen,"" and although I don't hesitate to recommend it, it's not as good as it could have been.",Fallen

70,Gunnar_Runar_Ingibjargarson,Damn good!,5,24 June 2008,"Although it received mixed reactions from critics and audiences alike when released in 1998, this supernatural thriller benefits from a sustained atmosphere of anticipation and dread, and its combination of detective mystery and demonic mischief is handled with ample style and intelligence. Under the direction of Gregory Hoblit (who fared better with Primal Fear), Denzel Washington plays detective John Hobbes, who witnesses the gas-chamber execution of a serial killer (Elias Koteas). But when another series of murders begins, Hobbes suspects that the killer's evil spirit has survived and is possessing the bodies of others to do its evil bidding. Even Hobbes's trusted partner (John Goodman) thinks the detective is losing his grip on reality, but the dire warnings of a noted linguist (Embeth Davidtz) confirm Hobbes's far-out theory, and his case intensifies toward a fateful showdown. Although its idea is better than its execution, and the story's film noir ambitions are never fully accomplished, this slickly directed thriller has some genuinely effective moments in which evil forces are entwined into the fabric of everyday reality. Among the highlights is a memorable scene in which Detective Hobbes must track the killer as the evil spirit is transferred between many people via physical contact. Even if the film is ultimately less than the sum of its parts, it's an intriguing hybrid that resides in the same cinematic neighborhood as Seven and The Silence of the Lambs with a cast that also includes Donald Sutherland and James Gandolfini. Included on the DVD is a full-length audio commentary by director Hoblit, screenwriter Nicholas Kazan, and producer Charles Roven.",Fallen
71,rollernerd,timeeee is my side...yes it is!,7,19 April 2021,"Welcome to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! Queue in intro music**Howdy folks!! Ladies, gents, I hope you all enjoy the show...Today's movie review is the chilling psychological thriller Fallen (1998) where the premise is literally 'don't trust a soul.' Let me first tell you this movie was not what I expected and the title makes more sense throughout the story of the film. Set in realistic and ordinary circumstances the film starts off with an evil villain who lives mostly in our minds with a flashback of when a character inviting the audience of a time they almost died which cuts to a death row gas chamber of a homicidal killer who was caught by my man Denzel Washington as the conventional Detective John Hobbes. The soon to be gassed to death killer uses his dying breath to sing an old Rolling Stones tune ""Time Is on My Side."" Soon we come across a string of murder threads that lead to whether the killer who got caught has a copycat...or perhaps it may be Denzel's character...or perhaps it is not what it may seem. The evil presence in the film moves from person to person, and there is a chase scene in a crowd that is eerily effective because there's no way to tell who the pursuer is. See the film, and you'll understand.FYI for you moviegoers - this is not your typical thriller suspense film and may not be for everyone, especially for ones who have minimal patience as the movie does play with your mind and time as it lacks screen gore visuals. However to me thats how a thriller movie works, especially when it requires your full attention. Sit back and be absorbed by the story, be amazed by the turn the plot leads towards and be intrigued by the climax of this underrated film. Kudos to the director Gregory Hoblit for crafting an intricate story which engaged me from the get-go. The story is elaborate and will keep you guessing till the very end, in particular, the narration aspect of the movie was a really clever little add-on and literally ties the whole movie together. However, it is not nearly as good as it could have been and has a sense of an afternoon movie but it is the execution of a great idea that makes it fun to watch - overall 7.5/10.",Fallen

In fact, I suspect this is one of those movies that ""grow on you"" with each viewing.  Perhaps it will acquire a minor cult following in the years to come.One complaint - Denzel Washington is starting to look like a major disappointment as an actor.  His versatility and emotional range are really limited, and I kept waiting for him to say ""Explain it to me like I'm a two-year-old"" like he kept saying in the movie ""Philadelphia.""  Really, he's Denzel Washington playing Denzel Washington in most of the movies he's in. Like someone else commented, I think a better choice of actors would have improved the film.I rated this movie 7/10 (= 3 stars out of 4).  It could have been 3 1/2, except for the appealing but untalented Denzel Washington, and a rather disappointing performance by Donald Sutherland.Minor Spoiler Alert:The surprise ending is indeed surprising.  Not really so much what becomes of Azazel, but who the narrator turns out to be.  The second time I saw this movie, I found that I had forgotten, and was surprised a second time!",Fallen
74,Jerique,Fallen...,9,7 November 2009,"I remember seeing this when I was only ten. It took two times watching it and two times having it explained for me to finally understand the mechanics of the movie. However, nowadays, it's one of my most favourite movies of all time.Denzel Washington, once again, pulls off a masterpiece and John Goodman is in his lovable role as the sidekick, but somehow, John pulls off the role in a new approach. Detective John Hobbes (Washington), is trying to wrap his head around copycat crimes that keep piling up, despite the fact that he watched the execution of the serial killer, Edgar Reese (Elias Koteas). John's partner, Jonesy (Goodman) and his boss Stanton (Donald Sutherland) tried to give him a hand along the way.It's got a lot more comedy for this thriller type of movie. It's got lots of suspense and it's got some short action scenes. It's fun to watch and it's pretty easy flowing paced.I think the things that stand out for me, are: Denzel's narration, the opening credits and how much fun they are, and the last scene and the amount of drama there is.It's a good movie, and for anyone into spirits and higher beings, this will be a great movie for you.",Fallen
75,basrutten,"Oh no, not another mediocre serial killer movie!",6,21 July 2002,"""Fallen"" is another addition to the seemingly endless list of mediocre thrillers that are out there (Along Came a Spider, the Bone Collector, Stir of Echoes). It's not a terrible movie, but it's so completely redundant and forgettable that one wonders why it was ever made in the first place.Granted, the idea behind this movie is interesting, but the plot suffers from a little too much coincidences and leaps in logic (a common flaw in thrillers), it never gets really exciting and the characters are all paper-thin. I especially hate the stupid voice-overs, which sound like they come from a corny 40's detective movie. I guess this movie is OK when you've really seen everything else, but otherwise do yourself a favor and watch ""Seven"" or ""Silence of the Lambs"" instead. Those are real thrillers, this one is mostly filler.*1/2 out of **** stars",Fallen
76,monkeysgalore,"Liked it, But Wanted to Really Like it",7,26 November 2019,"NOTE: I've labeled this with spoilers, but the spoilers will be at the end with a warning.""Fallen"" is a weird movie. When I watched it, I was entertained yes, which I guess was ultimately the point, but it felt like there should've been more. I ultimately finished having been delivered less than I was promised.The plot, though anyone reading this review will probably already know it, follows John Hobbes (Denzel Washington), a decorated police detective, who begins investigating several murders which have the same MO of a serial killer he caught, who was executed several years prior.Nicholas Kazan, the writer, wrote a really good screenplay here, and the pacing does chug along pretty smoothly, with the occasional slow, character-oriented parts, the obligatory murder parts, the planning parts, and the standard action parts. All familiar, standard ingredients, blended together and made to work effectively.Director Gregory Hoblit really did a great job, and everything is well shot and set up. The conflict scenes to move the plot along are especially well done. Hoblit obviously has a proficiency doing films like, this being known for this film, ""Primal Fear"", ""Frequency"", ""Hart's War"", and ""Fracture"", so he's no stranger to thrillers.Everyone's performances were good, especially Denzel Washington, who plays himself, which is great because people want to see Denzel play Denzel. As I've said before, I maintain that Denzel Washington is possibly the greatest actor alive, and definitely my favorite. You can have your Robert DeNiros and Al Pacinos, I'll take Denzel any day. He seems so genuine in every movie he does, throwing himself effortlessly into his roles, and often raising what would otherwise be standard material to above-average levels. You just can't not root for him. Aside from him though, everyone else did an excellent job, as is expected when Donald Sutherland, James Gandolfini, and John Goodman are supporting roles. I was actually surprised at the all-star cast this film had, as it really seems like it flew under the radar. It definitely deserves more attention than it's gotten, I think.It might be a somewhat difficult movie to classify, but at its core it's a supernatural thriller, bordering on a horror film. It's got some horror elements, all the aforementioned thriller elements, and even some action elements. IMDb often gets it right when it classifies certain films in certain genres, but sometimes it misses the mark, as it does here. Don't be fooled by the ""Action/Crime/Drama"" listing. Action fans may be disappointed. There are the aforementioned action elements though, arguably enough to call it an action film, though just barely. These include the foot chase and street scene, and the final battle. That's a thing I liked about this film, is that for a cop thriller/serial killer movie, it was surprisingly non-violent. There was a brutal scene or two, but barely any blood, and some of the violence is left more to interpretation. It doesn't smother you with violence and gore, adding much more importance and finality when those scenes do occur.Anyway, as for the film itself, it was good. Probably worth one watch, especially if you're a ""Denzealot"" like me, and can't get enough of Mr. Washington. Be warned, there is a twist ending, and the rug will be pulled out from under you, in case you don't like movies that are less than straight-forward.SPOILERS AHEAD:As I said, the movie is weird. It has some tonal shifts, but that happens when you merge genres. The same could be said about action/comedy films, or horror/comedy films, and the shifts are subtle. I personally kind of liked them, as they added to the strangeness. Example: The opening credits play over the serial killer as he is escorted down a prison hallway by police, and he dances. The credits are in a gothic font, and this all occurs while ""Time is on My Side"" by the Rolling Stones plays. It was a really interesting move, which does make sense as the song figures somewhat prominently later in the film.Other shifts happen, such as detectives following up a lead (cop thriller), and in the next scene a brutal murder takes place (horror film). I was fine with all this until the end. The ending was my only problem with the film.In the end, Hobbes, after learning that his adversary is a demon/fallen angel named Azazel, drives out to a remote cabin in the wilderness, which was owned by the man whom Azazel had possessed and made to look like a serial killer before Hobbes caught him. You see, Azazel can possess whoever he wants, whenever he wants, and for however long he wants. After a violent confrontation in which two of Hobbes most trust police friends are killed (one kills the other while possessed, and is than killed himself by Hobbes), that's when things get weird. Hobbes allows himself to be possessed by Azazel (Azazel can't normally possess Hobbes, as he's special, but when in his natural, non-possessive form, he has more strength than usual), but the twist is that he poisoned himself.So we see Hobbes body slowly die with Azazel inside of him (Azazel can't live for very long while not possessing someone, so he should die when Hobbes dies, as there are no other hosts around). Up until this point, the film played by its own rules well, and set up a good ending, in which the hero sacrifices himself to kill the evil. But that's not what happens. Hobbes dies, and Azazel takes control of a random cat under the porch, and it turns out the whole voice-over narration from Hobbes, present throughout the film, was Azazel using Hobbes' voice. Azazel, in the cat, slinks off into the woods back to civilization to continue killing. What. The. Hell.The whole film played like a thriller, establishing the characters, especially the insanely likable protagonist, and established a clear and clever way to beat the villain. But it turns out the film was a horror film, acting as a thriller, only to reveal itself as a horror film in the end. The cat had never even been seen until the final shot. Why establish all these characters and backstory, only to render it all pointless? The good guy was so clearly set up to win, despite the villain being step ahead the entire film, only for him to win. What was the point? Was there an underlying message, or was the whole thing set up just to screw the audience from the beginning? Why did we witness all this character development for Hobbes and conversations with the demon expert on how to beat it? It made no sense. If I'd known it'd be a horror film with a horror film ending, then fine. But no. It just felt like it should've had a different, or at least more thoughtful ending for such a ""high concept"" movie, without an illogical deus ex machina ending thrown in just to cheat the viewer. I would've been more open to having my expectations subverted had it at the very least been plausible (within the movie's rules).Overall, entertaining, but ultimately unfulfilling, I give it a 7 instead of a 6 because of the performances, and first well-plotted 3/4 of the film. Not Denzel's best or worst.",Fallen

The acting is great but it is let down by a plot which at times makes little sense, things are talked about and are never followed up, they try to make to many mini story lines while leaving the main plot a bit under cooked. The ending is disappointing as it fails to add up, if the cat is possessed in the end then how is Denzel Washington doing the voice? it is a shame as a bit more care with the story line and a better script it would have been a 10, I enjoyed it hence 6 my wife did not like it as it was confusing.",Fallen

Then, I decided to give this film a second chance. Some of the scenes that didn't make any sense before now did, but it's too bad that you have to watch a movie twice to get the whole picture. Anyway, I really didn't like the direction the movie took. At first, it could be an OK thriller, but with all this supernatural stuff it just got dumb.

With a tense pace that keeps you guessing and keeps things moving along, Fallen is not your typical suspense thriller. With it's religious and metaphysical overtones, it really brings an original angle into this tired genre. With an unusual soundtrack laying down a weird vibe, this is a film that you should look into if you haven't seen it already. Bottom Line: A great film that's sadly not as well known as it should be.

Now make the characters less interesting and remove all the gore and most of the suspense. If you can picture all that, you'd be picturing Fallen. Denzel Washington plays his typical cop role, which by this point he has completely mastered and does a great job at it. The plot was pretty interesting, though derivative of more than just The Thing. Kept my attention though, despite moving very slowly in the middle. Aside from Washington's character, nobody has any depth to them. Though well acted, I wish they would have got more into Donald Sutherland's character, in my opinion that was a waste of a good performance.

The movie begins as a standard police murder/mystery, and the circumstances of the murders are peculiar enough to gain your interest. Too bad it couldn't have stayed in that realm. Without spoiling the film completely, it's enough to say that once it turned toward the supernatural, it fell completely flat for me. I mean, how can a serious actor like Denzel Washington speak those lines with a straight face? At least Donald Sutherland (who never seems to stop making one movie or another for a single day of the year) was given a part he could play straight without having to spout mumbo-jumbo. John Goodman only had to get himself through a couple of ridiculous lines. But poor Denzel was in the thick of it, pretending to be part of some titanic struggle of good vs. evil. Pshaw! The little twist at the ending was just SO cheesy, lifted from three hundred previous horror flicks; I wanted to spit. Another phony bit borrowed from every horror flick ever made was when Denzel is alone in the basement, scary, scary, suddenly there is a thunderous crash and something huge drops on him from above. Oh, never mind, it was just the old rotting ceiling falling in, nothing to worry about after all. Carry on. We do this in scary movies to keep you from getting bored. Eeyew! I also object to a good deal of the camera work, with all its quick cuts and constant shifting of angle and perspective so that you often don't know what you're looking at. To me that sort of thing is a poor man's substitute for a good script. I gave it five stars instead of less, because the mystery started off as something interesting and because of some of the this-world performances, such as Goodman's and the other cop (played by James Gandolfini, I believe).

Then it took a turn and first I thought ""oh no, it's turning in to one of those movies"" but then I realized it was still good, even better, I actually liked it a lot, it just wasn't what I first thought it would be. I believe this script could easily had become somewhat of a cheesy horror movie in the wrong hands, but not here, it's very well directed; has this gritty vibe and feel, like a David Finch movie kind of. And you're kept in suspense trough the whole movie, not knowing what's going to happen or how things will go down. And the acting is very good, supurb really. Very good dynamics between all characters, even side characters. I think this is Goodmans best role in his career. And Denzel takes the whole movie to another level, he is one of those actor that can do that, I think he must be one of the, if not the, greatest actor in American cinema actually. Anyway, this a good movie all I can say. Kind of an underrated movie but a real gem. I also appreciate it when movies can be creepy and scary without having to use gore or torture scenes.

It is therefore very different from what Hollywood normally delivers.The story is not completely new but more original than in most other films around. The film is not predictable and never loses its tension. It is also very cruel at times and that's why it made me feel uncomfortable (a rare ability of today's films). The actors did a good job and Denzel Washington is credible (as usual). The minor roles were cast very well too, especially John Goodman and Embeth Davidtz seemed very convincing to me. Another strong point is the direction which creates an interesting and exciting atmosphere also supported by the score.This film doesn't get the attention it deserves. It is one of the best mystery-thrillers of the last years. In my opinion it doesn't show any weak points. I'm glad that it is still possible to shoot a movie that doesn't have to fit into the normal clichés because that's the way we get really interesting experiences.Watch it if you're tired of all the other (standard) films.My rating: 10/10",Fallen
105,bigdgun,"The second time you see this movie, it all comes home",9,14 January 2001,"This is a must-see. Not once, but twice. There is a trick ending that you almost need to view before the movie begins. The first time I watched Fallen, I was confused. But the second time when I knew what was coming, it all fit into place and the movie was easy to follow. Beautifully scripted and magically acted by Denzel Washington who was just coming into his prime with this movie, Fallen is a sly, witty portrayal of the battle between good and evil. And which side really wins? You will never listen to the Rolling Stones the same way again.",Fallen
106,hengir,Fallen Up,7,16 November 2005,"Came across this film in a video store sale bin at a giveaway price and bought it on the strength of the cast, Denzil Washington, John Goodman, Donald Sutherland and Embeth Davidtz. Found it to be surprisingly good. Not a horror film as such, no gore or unconvincing CGI effects but a gripping story with supernatural elements. There are subtle shivers, particularly the 'touching' scenes and the sense of something evil hidden behind the everyday. The setting is bleakly autumnal and it is finishes with a nice twist. If you watch the film again knowing the ending it makes more sense.Of the acting, Goodman and Sutherland don't have much to play with but it is always good to see them in a film. Washington is very good as his normal cop character grapples with the mystery and Davidtz is excellent as the academic, scared and solitary and fallible. The scenes between Washington and Davidtz are well played. Tan Dun's music adds to the atmosphere. Well directed and well written. Well done.",Fallen

Wonderful performances by Washington, Goodman, and all the cast. Never seen anything like it.",Fallen
108,epsilon3,Not quite Se7en...,8,17 November 2002,"...but almost. The similarities are there for all to see. A uncorruptable cop, a rainy city, an intricate plotline involving a clever serial killer and a noirish feel to the whole thing.Make no mistake - like Se7en, Fallen is a very good movie.
The acting is great for the most part (especially from Denzel) although it's depressing to see Donald Sutherland (one of my heroes) wasting himself on yet another meaningless chief of police/army/prisons role. John Goodman was a bit hard to accept as a hard bitten cop, but that's my fault rather than his as his acting was good, I just can't quite shake Rosanne out of my mind.The plot is good despite some oversights that if examined closely produce logic problems. Examine almost any movie too closely and you'll find these - you're either willing to accept them (as long as they're not too major) or you're not. I fall into the former camp - when we see a movie we're only witnessing a slice of what is going on. There may be a perfectly good reason why Azazel didn't transfer into Hobbes from the beginning - just because the plot doesn't spell it out to us doesn't mean it's a logic flaw.Azazel's transference from person to person produces some really good scenes, especially when Gretta Milano is fleeing from him, and when Hobbes accosts him on the street after his visit to the precinct. The ending is a pleasure and has a classic twist - the use of the flashback sequence at the beginning was inspired.Overall - there's quite a lot going for this movie - I'd go as far as to say that it's one of the best thrillers of recent years. With good performances, plot and an intelligent message somewhere within, Fallen is well worth your time.",Fallen
109,moviemanic07,A fascinating and chilling film....,9,14 March 2005,"Detective John Hobbs finds himself battling a formidable supernatural foe when a string of serial killings continue after the murderer dies in the gas chamber in this compelling thriller written by Nicholas Kazan and directed by Gregory Hoblit. Usually, I don't expect much from big-budget studio ""horror"" movies except special effects overkill. This film is a rare, pleasing exception that doesn't insult the intelligence of the audience. I really liked the script. It was rich and complex, even if, in retrospect, the misleading voice-over crossed the line. I was really expecting a lot more from writer Kazan after this film. Hard to believe all he's been able to deliver subsequently was ""Homegrown,"" ""Bicentennial Man"" and ""Enough."" Enough indeed! As good as the script is, the film ultimately belongs to the actors. Denzel Washington is terrific, and it is great to see him backed up with talented supporting actors like Donald Sutherland, John Goodman, and a then-unknown James Gandolfini. Director Hoblit relaxes the pace enough at times to linger on their byplay, which gives the characters depth. Of course, all of that character development would have been wasted if the film didn't deliver, and it does. Don't expect any gore, but there is suspense galore. A fascinating and chilling film.",Fallen
110,The_Matrix_Rocks,"In 5 Lines or Less - ""Fallen"" (Movie Review)",7,16 December 2007,"I finally got around to watching this ""off the beaten track"" gem.Denzel Washington was in fine form years ago as the confused yet strong black man, who finally figures it out - a role he has reprised so many times (Pelican Brief, Out of Time, Manchurian Candidate, and most recently in Deja Vu).What impressed me was the boldness of the story/writers to colour outside the lines with the narrative.This boldness was further demonstrated by the director in the decision to allow the strength of the concept to dominate the presentation, instead of some flashy gimmicky special effects (although in fairness, this may have been a default position due to lack of budget - discretion, it seems, remains the better part of valour.) Heartily recommended for anyone looking to engage a slightly alternative story for a couple of hours - you'll find that ""time is on (your) side""!",Fallen
111,Zalis,One of the best. . .,9,24 January 2000,"I saw this back in January '98 when it was released.  This movie turned out to be perfect for such a late winter night.  My friends and I found the film to be dark, scary, mysterious, etc. , but also funny in some twisted way.  I also loved the ending--a great finale to a dark and twisted 2 hours. I like the slower pace; it actually kept me on edge, in an edgy anticipation.  The only part I didn't like was the character Gretta Milano. Overall, a different sort of flick, worthy of several repeat viewings. (9/10)",Fallen
112,arahman,Fear My Wrath,7,28 June 2005,"Upon release Fallen was largely overlooked by the public despite the fact the mighty Denzel took the lead role as Detective Hobbes and was backed up by a decent support cast including Donald Sutherland as his annoying Lt and John Goodman as Hobbes' loyal partner (who takes time out to discuss the meaning of life and the virtues of pizza with Hobbes). Fallen brings together the classic cop/ serial killer movie with the horror/demonic genre, a sub category that has been depicted on the big screen and in the guise of various X files/ Sci-fi channel concoctions. However, Denzel gives a fine performance as a straight cop who takes care of his brother and nephew whilst eliminating the evil criminals that pervade Philadelphia. Hobbes' character is a symbol of decency and is almost angelic in nature (courtesy of Denzel's well spoken tongue and calm manner). The story begins with Denzel saying good bye to Reese, a serial killer who he has put on death row. After Reese faces the gas chamber Denzel thinks that matter is closed (a safe bet under normal circumstances). Copycat murders start to pop up however with messages and clues that lead Denzel to a very different conclusion. Denzel must face Azael, a fallen angel hell bent on the fall on civilisation (one murder at a time) who has some very original demonic abilities. Azazel is cursed with being formless but is able to move from one being to next and fully control that individual, except for Hobbes. It is this inability to control Hobbes that fascinates Azazel and leads him to toy with the detective. The story evolves at a slow pace but the lead character's performances are so good and understated that you are more than happy to wait. Fallen is more of psychological thriller than horror movie and has a captivating effect on its audience. The plot evolves to an original and exciting finale that leaves the viewer considering many ""what if"" scenarios. Overall, this is a well constructed and entertaining movie that remains fresh with repeat viewings (the true mark of a classic). It also makes great use of the Rolling Stones track ""Time is on my side"" which is eerily recited by Azazel as a reminder to others of his immortality. You will be miming it for a day (which has the added benefit of alarming others who have seen the film).",Fallen
113,jackhamel1987,Very underrated,7,29 August 2011,"I think Fallen is a somewhat underrated supernatural thriller. There should probably be a list somewhere for underrated films. This would be on it. It has a good cast, good plot and some clever direction. It's not perfect, and could have done with a little bit extra here and there, but it's certainly worth your time if you're a fan of slow-burning thrillers. Detective John Hobbs (Denzel Washington) has caught a killer. That killer has been sentenced to death. Before dying, the killer warns Hobbs that he'll be watching him. The killer is executed. Hobbs gets on with his life. That is, until another murder is committed - one that is a copycat, one that suggests the original serial killer had an accomplice, or a fan. Hobbs starts to battle the killer, but finds evidence that suggests the killer isn't human, but is a demon that possesses humans and kills to bring about the fall of civilization. Hobbs and the demon begin a game of cat and mouse that leads to Hobbs being suspected of murder himself, and a final, chilling and clever climax.This film is an effective thriller, because it has a good story to begin with. It's not one that's entirely original(demonic possessions have been done before), but Nicholas Kazan's script has enough in it to make it solid and interesting. There is some very credible dialogue, some good plot twists and some good characterization. There is also a solid twist at the end. To build upon the good script, there is also some good acting. Donald Sutherland gives a good, credible performance as the 'couldn't care less' boss who is trying only to cover himself. He in turn is upstaged by John Goodman, who gives a very strong performance as Jonesy, Hobbs' faithful partner. Finally, the direction is strong and sometimes inventive. You get a real feel for the streets of Philadelphia and the countryside around it. More importantly, you get a real feel for the demon because of the good techniques used to portray it. There are some downsides, unfortunately, which do prevent this from being a notch higher. At times, the pace of the film is a little too slow. And because it's just a little too slow, it's easy to lose track of what's happening and why. I feel certainly towards the hour mark, that this needed a little more power and pace behind it. It also could have done with a bit more in terms of the supernatural side - sometimes the demon was underused. I also think that this doesn't represent Denzel Washington at his best. He never seems to really get into this role as much as he could have done. He normally steals a film when he's in it - but this time he's upstaged by Donald Sutherland and John Goodman, who are far more credible in their roles. Finally, the use of the Rolling Stones music detracts from the supernatural element. I am a Stones fan - but their music wasn't right for this movie. Overall, this is underrated and is worth watching if you like a slow burner. But it could have been a bit better quite easily.",Fallen

It was chilling and creepy in just about the right measure - enough to keep you going, not so much you can't stand to watch. I thought the very lovely Embeth Davidtz was basically wasted (although it was interesting to see her character using her real name) and Sutherland's role was also a little lacking. Washington continues to be a legitimate star vehicle and the remainder of the supporting cast was strong. An interesting tale - how come Azazel couldn't enter everyone by touch, but never ran up against anyone resistant on the street??? - with an interesting twist in the end (although I could kinda see it coming - dang cats!) and keeps you watching.

118,Tet-5,"Great story, boring characters",8,17 June 1999,"Fallen is a good movie, and I really enjoyed watching it. But unfortunately there is one thing wrong with this film, so it shall never become one of my favorites.During the greater part of the movie, the plot was surprisingly good. The scene in which Denzel Washington meets Azazel in the police-station and on the street is absolutely great, the chase-scene is fantastic! Fallen is often compared with Se7en. This too was a thriller with a very good script, a movie that absorbs you from the beginning till the end. But Se7en offers the viewers something more: interesting characters. Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt, Gwyneth Palthrow and, of course, Kevin Spacey make you really believe in the persons they play. I wish the scriptwriters of Fallen would have paid as much attention to their characters as the writers of Se7en did. I never really cared for Denzel Washington, his brother or his nephew. And the part of Embeth Davidtz wasn't interesting either. Denzel Washington is a very good actor (he was fantastic is Glory and Philadelphia). But in Fallen, his talents haven't been used as good as they could have been. The character he plays is very flat. This goes even stronger for the role of Donald Sutherland. This was a supporting part completely played on the automatic pilot, and therefore very boring. Luckily there was John Goodman. It's always a pleasure seeing him in a movie. The best role no doubt was for Elias Koteas, who gave a very strong performance as the first Azazel. I doubted whether I would vote 7 or 8 out of 10. I guess it was the music that made me decide for the 8: it's been weeks since I've seen this movie, and I still catch myself humming ""Time is on my side""!",Fallen
119,polos_are_minty,Fallen,7,28 March 2010,"Fallen is a film which I was not paticualuly bothered about either way. When looking into it, I had heard it had mixed to negative reviews. So I was not expecting anything brilliant. I was therefore marginally surprised. Not a great film, but by no means a terrible one.Denzel Washington is usually one of my least favoured actors, he has made some great films, but also some utter rubbish. I would say his performance in fallen fell between the two, and he was average. Some.of the best parts of the film were in the shooting, some of the camera angles and colours used whilst in 'demon view' were impressive, and actually quite haunting. One thing I found was, our always seemed to be raining, especially when in the Police station, you could always see it bucketing down through the windows, whether this was done to create tension I don't know, but it made me think the director liked to do stuff with the weather.I do like a twist ending, the sort that makes you go back and review all that you have seen and view it in a new light. So for me the ending was probably my favourite bit. I mean yes it's cliché, setting it in the desolate forest. But so what, it's quite fun, and definitely entertaining.For me, a slightly above average thriller, with nothing paticualy special about it. 7/10",Fallen

121,Tresy,The Violent Bore It Away (Spoilers),5,27 September 2000,"Given the current political rhetoric about nihilistic film violence, a film like ""Fallen"" should warm the cockles of the most dour fundie's shriveled heart. After all, this is a movie in which evil is a direct manifestation of demonic intervention in our affairs, and that we--at least some of us, anyway--are chosen by God to fight it. This isn't nihilistic violence; it's godly violence!And that's the problem. At least with nihilistic violence you know where you stand. Bad is bad, and good is, well, badder than bad. And because it's badder than bad, good wins in the end. Very simple.With Fallen, however, the eternal verities are upended. Bad people aren't really bad; they are just possessed by bad spirits. (Guns don't kill people; people possessed by fallen angels do.) Good people are so good they are either boring--Denzel Washington's John Hobbes--or virginal (Embedth Davidtz). For the good guy to win, he can't just kick ass. That would be Bad.  No, the good guy has to lose, and in losing, win, just like Christ, who according to Christian doctrine prevailed over evil by dying on the cross and taking on in so doing the sins of the world.But here's the wrinkle, and the problem with Fallen. If Evil in ""Fallen"" preys on humanity, rather than residing in it, then human morality is irrelevant, as free will becomes a joke. We are just the playthings of celestial beings, and have no real responsibility for our actions. So there's really nobody to root against.Moreover, if the Evil One is vanquished, then we are at the end of history. Since that is clearly not the case, the film is obliged to let evil win, undercutting the entire christocentric allegory of the film. Talk about your basic bummer.Give me Bruce Willis kicking terrorist ass any day.",Fallen

But then, the slow pace starts to build and the story begins to take shape, until the film completely turns around to become a serious religious-related good/evil story. Denzel Washington is perfect for the part of the angel cop who just seems to be at the right place at the right time, and find every clue there is possible to find. I must say the first half is boring, but the thought of rejecting and leaving this great storyline would have been outrageous. Unpredictability is the film's great weapon, and, after the film finally gets the complex meaning into the viewers' minds, the film has the freedom of choosing dozens of good endings. The ending is surprisingly and satisfyingly delicious, like the ending of ""Devil's Advocate"". Even the film's tenaciously slow pace is forgiven because of its wickedness at the end.

If any readers got an explanation, please let me know WHY AZAZEL'S NOT ABLE TO TRANSFER IN THE BEGINNING OF THE MOVIE, BUT DENZEL'S WORRIED ABOUT IT FOR THE REST OF THE MOVIE?

Fallen ironically falls down on all these areas.Plot holes abound. Why does the demon chase after Hobbes yet isn't able to jump into him, oh except at the end where the whole cliffhanger situation is made nonsensical because Hobbes now has to kill himself to prevent that happening? Why bother driving out to old man Milano's shack to discover the demon's name on a wall when he could have just asked his daughter who already knew all about it? Why... I could go on, but others have already covered this in their reviews.What also bugged me though was the unrealistic actions of the characters: A normal person picking his way through a cobwebbed, shadowy old abandoned house in the woods would be scared witless, yet Hobbes just had an expression of mild curiosity all the way through, even when the conveniently frightening roof beam half fell down (because he took a book off it???) and should have scared the bejesus out of him. When talking to Gretta in a piazza, he doesn't just stand there talking to her as a normal person would do. No he has to dramatically stride back and forward, wandering around her while she stands still and talking loudly so everyone can hear despite the sensitive nature of the conversation. No-one does that! When his brother is killed, Hobbes tells the young boy that his Dad has died. Not only does the child somehow psychically anticipate the news (""he's not just asleep is he?"") but then appears not to care when the death is confirmed. No tears, he just looks away with an expression of mild indifference. Completely unrealistic! Hobbes chases a possessed character up some steps onto a railway platform, but when he gets to the platform there is no-one there. Yet we then see that the possessed man is actually on the other side of the tracks, still observing Hobbes. How did he get there? The demon doesn't give humans super powers and this guy was clearly a little portly (I'm being generous) so couldn't have sprinted that fast.Why would the James Galdofino character be asking about Hobbes looking at a map, why was he suddenly so interested yet never followed this up? Why on earth would Hobbs throw his car keys into the forest when he reached the shack for the last time? Even if you weren't planning to come back, no-one would realistically do that, they would just die with the car keys still in their pocket, it was a completely pointless gesture done only for dramatic effect. Hobbes kills his best mate at work yet shows no emotion at all, not even a 'sorry old chum'. Bang, you're dead, now where are my suddenly poisonous cigarettes? He should have been torn up inside about having to do that, it should have been such a dramatic moment. Imagine if you had to kill your best friend, would you act as though you were just swatting a fly?If he was dying from the cigarettes (how did he 'lace' them?) why struggle to run away at the end? He didn't need to, what was the point of that? It just looked good for the cameras. Then having collapsed in the snow 100m away from the house, the camera went to an overhead shot showing him sprawled out just a few feet away from the car and the other bodies. That didn't make sense either.Hmm, I'm mixing up character flaws with plot holes but to be honest the whole thing was a big mess as well. There was no real tension, the whole tag-you're-it demon transfer theory didn't work as well as it should, there was plenty of annoying mumbling so half the dialogue was inaudible, and the ending was completely unsatisfactory and left you thinking 'what was the point of that then?'.Rarely have I enjoyed a film less, and by the end my face had fallen so maybe that's the logic behind the name of the film.",Fallen

137,tlarry858,"The viewer should be forewarned that meaning, theme, logic, and film aesthetics are at a premium in this disappointing film.",4,25 December 2002,"Where to begin? The plot of this film demands, no, requires, a willing suspension of disbelief.  It appears that angels are very real entities-and so are fallen angels.  The title of the film thus betrays its content.  The very silly premise of the film is that fallen angles are out to get God in a big way.  And what more diabolical way to reap vengeance on Him than to just generally screw up, play mind games with, and, yes, to wantonly kill these creatures made in His image?If we are to believe this humorless film, Beelzebub, and others of his ilk, are behind all of the serial killings plaguing today's society.  But evil is fallible. Because these demons are still somehow ""spiritual"" beings, they must inhabit a human (or animal) ""host.""  Once a demon enters its host, the host does the demon's bidding with the total loyalty and obedience of a robot.  But the relationship is anything but beneficial to the host.  One of the favorite games of the demons is to see how many serial killings they can chalk up before their human host is shot, gassed, hypodermically syringed, or electrocuted into non-existence.  When their human host gives up the ghost, they just peacefully waft away on the breeze to land on some other poor unsuspecting human (or animal).!!!!!SPOILER!!!!!Denzel Washington stars as John Hobbes, a Philadelphia homicide detective who has somehow ticked off Azazel, the head fallen angel.  In fact, getting Hobbes becomes, for no apparent reason, the demon's special project. Apparently, life in Demonsville is real dull.  Anyway, Hobbes becomes the pet whipping boy of Azazel, who generally makes a pest of himself.  In rapid succession, Azazel has Hobbes suspended from the police force, suspected of murder, and finally hounded by the police-an outlaw hopelessly on the run.All of this mumbo-jumbo is fueled by the daughter of a homicide detective who was likewise harassed 30 years earlier and ended up a suicide.  The daughter, Gretta Milano (Embeth Davidtz), is a professor of religion, no less. Ms. Milano is, no doubt, too serious about her work and needs to lighten up a little. She ultimately succumbs to Hobbes charms and befriends Washington and his young nephew (now orphaned by the brother's murder) who are on the run at this point in the film.  (Shades of Hitchcock's The Wrong Man.)Azazel and the other demons have one pretty nifty trick that makes them all but invincible-they can hop from one host to another with all the happy facility of fleas.  Merely touching someone on the shoulder, or shaking hands, allows the demon to exchange hosts faster than Donald Trump or Jay Leno can change automobiles.  Why, it's like a fun game of tag-You're it! Only the first prize for the luckless host is a kick in the seat of the pants.Well, if there are demons (fallen angels to be exact), then does the film make the corollary statement that God exists?  Note quite.  The only serious religious questions raised in the film are answered in the negative. Hobbes, for example, has lost his faith, or what little he had, through years as a big city police officer. He has come to no great revelation about earth, life, death, God, or any other teleological question.  Nor is there any great epiphany for Hobbes at the end of the film.The film, directed by Gregory Hoblit (Primal Fear, 1996), seems to say that all of the villains and the nameless evil lurking out there, just beyond our peripheral vision, are caused by the machinations and conscious purpose of the demon brigade.  This happy thought releases us-who, let it be understood, are created in God's image and have freedom of choice-from any blame for the miserable state of human affairs.  This idea sounds suspiciously like the theme of Millennium, that most downbeat of all Fox television shows (now, sadly off the tube).  Why does it always seem to be Winter in any television show or film concerned with serious evil?  Perhaps they are all filmed in Canada where it is always winter.",Fallen

The moviebegins with us seeing the main character John Hobbs scurryingthrough the snow looking for a set of keys in order to escapecertain death.

We find out through the course of this moviethat Hobbs is a special Person whom the Fallen angel can't enterby touch the way he can others. So he ( Azazel the fallen angel )makes it his goal to ruin John Hobbs's life and enter him anotherway. The story proceeds to show us how the demon plans to dothis until we are taken back to the opening scene with John Hobbsrunning for the keys.

It tells the story of a police detective and an elusive serial killer, subtly but firmly injecting doses of Christian demonology and eschatology in the process. In the end, the filmmakers do allow themselves a bit of fantasy... I was irked by their selection of a cat as demon familiar, bypassing the top choice of a serpent.

You get to the end ready to see the hero make the noble sacrifice, but instead the demon survives by entering the body of a cat. All the lead up and hints to that moment throughout the entire movie are wasted and put to shame with this stupid ending. Sure some people may like when the hero falls short, but not many do this was a movie full of potential but is utterly ruined with a horrible ending. It is a 2 hour waste of time because of the ending, had Hobbs actually stopped the demon this movie would be one I would recommend people to watch.

144,HonestReviews,Utter Rubbish.,1,20 June 2014,"OK so where do we begin with this pile of absolute vile trash. I came across this film online as I am a big fan of Denzel Washington movies and was interested to watch more of his unknown films from the 90's and early 2000's. So I came across Fallen and noticed the rating of 7.0 so figured I'd give it a watch as it was classified as a thriller.This film is possibly one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Let's start with the good: Well, the end song that plays is Sympathy for the Devil by The Rolling Stones - a great song. This is the only good thing about the movie. Now for the bad:The plot was absolutely ridiculous. I'll admit I went into this film not knowing entirely what it was all about. I thought it was going to be a thriller, not some fantasy, sci-fi trash about the devil possessing other humans bodies. The plot is ludicrous and laughable. I lost interest and because of the terrible story telling, the movie loses it's title as a thriller. Now let's look at some of the main plot holes. When the devil is possessed in Resse's body, he touches Hobbes and doesn't infect him because Hobbes believes in God and wears a cross or something.... Resse then goes to get executed but he touches the executioner. Why therefore doesn't the executioner get possessed here? Instead the devil doesn't leave the body of Resse until Resse is executed. If he can enter any humans body when he is in spirit form then why didn't he just enter Hobbes body here? Instead he picks the executioner - who must be religious as well seen as he isn't possessed until spirit form - Never explained in the movie = bad storytelling and plot hole.What was the point of Hobbes having a brother? The character served no purpose to the plot. Why was Azazel (the devil) obsessed with killing people during the plot when at the end he seems to not care? Why didn't Hobbes chase after Azazel when he kept switching bodies in the street and try and stop him here? This amongst many other plot holes make this movie dreadful. That horrible sound effect and camera visuals which change when we see things through Azazel's point of view was painful and irritating to watch. Was it meant to be scary? All it did was annoy me.Now for the final scene. If Azazel was the narrator all along then why is he speaking in Hobbes voice when Hobbes dies at the end and he's entered the cat? Why did Azazel bother to bring his boss along? Surely he must have known what Hobbes plan was all along. Why not just bring a spare live body in the trunk of the car? Hobbes method for killing the devil is ridiculous. How did that detective know Azazel couldn't survive for longer than a human breath or whatever nonsense was given for his survival? Plot convenience... If Azazel can enter cats couldn't he just enter a bird? Finally, if Hobbes was smart then he would have just captured Azazel and wounded him, then kept him prisoner in some locked room for eternity. Or he could have taken him to a much quieter place like the middle of the ocean and let him die there? This film was truly awful and I'm angered I wasted 2 hours watching this trash. A real shame for Denzel, his acting was good, but the ridiculous story and plot didn't give him much to work with. Dreadful film, avoids at all costs.",Fallen
145,marc_wrz,A little-known classic,10,22 February 2002,"What a great movie. Its a shame that this film is not known by many. The story opens with Det. John Hobbes (Washington) ""dying"" in the snow. We then flashback to the incidents prior to this event, which makes up the movie. Hobbes brought a serial killer to justice, now said killer is to be executed. Hobbes watches the mad die in the chair, but its not over. In fact its just begun, the killer is actually a ""ghost"" now, I don't want to spoil the plot for you, because they're some very interesting things brought up about the killer. But anyways, the killer now inhabits bodies of others and starts his killing spree yet again. Hobbes investigates and soon learns that his old enemy has survived somehow, and soon learns of biblical ties to the killer. Soon, the chase begins, and Hobbes becomes both predator and prey.Overall, this movie was excellent. a 10, thanks to superb acting from all the cast, and the direction of the film was great, especially when you see the through the eyes of the killer.

Enter humans stage left, a big fat juicy chance to let off some rage and strike back at God at the same time. Have a little ""fun"" with his precious creation. You hate humanity because they will someday occupy the position you once held, basking in the love of God while you remain a doomed pariah, awaiting the ultimate public execution.

Having had personal experience (Native American descent), I know those things hate us. Most fiction has firm roots in fact. The film gives a rather accurate view of what reality truly holds and fleshes it out skillfully. Whether you are a believer or agnostic/atheist, this movie will have you looking at people next to you sideways for days to come. Denzel seems to have a penchant for occult and sci-fi based films that are unusual, but well crafted. Once again he has involved himself with a winner.

155,synthetikxspark,alright supernatural thriller,5,15 August 2004,"This movie wasn't horrible ... but it wasn't good. Th writing was great. Every ""fact"" was backed up in some way or explained in some way to leave the acts that were going on understood. An outcast angel was thrown out of heaven without a body and so it is able to take the body of humans by touch. The angel turned evil and enjoys death and singing. He or she grows a sort of infatuation with the main character played by Denzel Washington and wants to invade his body next. What keeps this story going is that this angel cannot enter his body, which is the only detail not explained(or maybe I missed it) but may be able to enter his body if his host carrier dies and he is left floating in the air... The basics of the movie are there good plot, good script, but fairly boring. There are no real thrills in this movie, it feels like more of a supernatural mystery but there's no mystery because we know whats going on. Something's missing there and that's what makes this film only mediocre. There is no filling. To use a really bad metaphor it's like going to eat a piece of pie and all you get is the crust. And the real sinker of the movie is the ending. Denzel figures out that he has to get this being to a secluded area - kill the host and then kill himself in the process because because this thing will die with no host. Little does he know that this being can use animals as hosts, it enters a cat's body and that's the end with the Denzel's voice narrating as the angel. It was terrible. The point of the movie seemed to be that this thing has been around for ever and Denzel would be the one to stop it. great idea that they killed with the ending. It made telling the story a waste. So anyway to the good....Denzel was excellent as always maybe not his best acting and I'm not sure he's cut out for narration but he was wonderful none the less. The female character in the movie(didn't write down her name) was also excellent. John Goodman was decent as well although I think he's better off sticking to white trash comedy.

The main idea itself is used to good effect, particularly in the scenes where Washington attempts to confront Azazel in his various guises, with occasional tragic effect.Unfortunately, however, the scripting is, as mentioned, a little on the patchy side and the addition of an ill-judged voice-over by Washington does nothing for the pace of the film.

That being said, it has a few flaws, mainly in the casting of the characters.  John Goodman plays his typical nice guy character throughout the movie, but you always sense his ""Barton Fink"" character underneath. Denzel Washington is convincing as a warm-hearted cop, but not as a noir hero trapped by evil.  Because Washington is so good-humored, a horror/noir movie ends on a note that is more matter-of-fact than dark.  I would have liked to have seen someone less fimiliar for Goodman's character and someone more depressed and desparate in Washington's place.  The movie is solid, mostly due to the frightening ideas and filming techniques.

170,cuttingedgenyc,Horrible direction (some spoilers),2,17 September 2005,"When there is a movie with an excellent cast of very famous actors that you've somehow never heard of, it's usually a good bet that the movie is terrible. Unfortunately, I disregarded this time-honored rule and watched this movie starring Denzel Washington, John Goodman, and Donald Sutherland. I usually have faith in Denzel to guide me to a decent movie, but he let me down with this one. I haven't yet posted here to completely pan a movie, but I felt a responsibility to warn you about this one.The movie has a relatively intriguing premise and not terrible writing, but it is totally ruined by pretentious, obnoxious direction. I was surprised to see that this director was the same guy who did Primal Fear, but then it all kind of made sense. This movie, like Primal Fear, is very full of its own importance, with ""edgy"" camera angles, melodramatic music and over-the-top acting. UNLIKE Primal Fear, the story is not entertaining enough to legitimize this melodrama. Instead you get a plot that is garbled and unintelligible and really doesn't have much to say. It's pretty much the fault of the director, in my opinion.The basic story is that some spirit named ""Azazil"" is able to transfer from body to body (we're not really ever told convincingly HOW this happens, or why - sometimes it appears to be at will and then sometimes not). ""Azazil"" has no real apparent motivation for wanting to wipe out the human race, except that he is ancient and pretty angry. This can still be entertaining in a scary movie that is directed well. Unfortunately, this is not such a movie. The director spends so much time trying to make the hokey plot seem ""smart"" that the story trips all over itself. Large parts of the plot that would be better left in to explain things seem to have been cut out, and events get laughably confusing and stupid. Yet the movie continues with a tone that would make you think the director and all its participants believe they are delivering the most meaningful movie since Citizen Kane. The end result of all the hokeyness is that Denzel Washington gets framed for various crimes. He then spends most of the last half of the movie yelling at ""Azazil"" (who we, and Denzel, of course cannot see most of the time, and who jumps rapidly from body to body). The camera angles and styles used to demonstrate ""Azazil's"" movement give the viewer a major headache. I stuck through it to see if there would be an interesting ending. There was not. Suffice it to say that John Goodman, when possessed by Azazil, is NOT scary. And the VERY end of the movie is GROANINGLY dumb - to the point that both my husband and I (who rarely agree on movies) both *actually* groaned.The only reason I gave this movie 2 stars instead of 1 is because Denzel tried so hard.",Fallen

172,kmhammer-66479,Falls short at the very end,7,15 September 2019,"This movie has some decent acting and an interesting plot. Unfortunately, at the very end what could have been a believable ending makes no sense whatsoever.Denzel's character learns that Azazel can survive for one breath or 500 cubits before needing to find a new host. He works out a plan to destroy Azazel which defies logic and the human desire to live. He lures Azazel into the wilderness, ultimately away from other humans. Then he shoots Azazel (in Goodman's body) leaving him mortally wounded. At this point, instead of leaving Azazel to die, he sits downs and chats with him while smoking a cigarette that is poisoned such that he will soon die too. I was, to say the least, dumbfounded at this decision. All he had to do was to run more than 500 cubits away (about 750 feet) and he would have survived. There is a final plot twist that would have occurred regardless of Denzel's decision. But he would have still been alive. Instead, he dies and Azazel is victorious. Meh.",Fallen

The horror is confined to your brain and not shown onscreen. Some people will (and do) hate this film; it eschews graphic storytelling for a visual, intellectual approach. The ending, which has been criticized for many reasons, is actually the only plausible way it could end. Yes we like to see the human spirit triumph, but more often than not things do not work out the way we like them to.

Later on the killer seems to keep his word when new victims are found. Denzel W. starts an investigation and tries to find out what the hell is happening. An intensive search for the killer begins, finally leading to a rather surprising result. Though the movie doesn't get much attention (at least not in Europe), it really is worth watching.

However, I did have a few questions, mostly concerning plot holes and things of that nature, so I immediately watched the parts in question again and found that everything ties in nicely with very few, if any, plot holes. If there are, I can not find them.John Hobbes (Denzel Washington) is a homicide detective who apprehended a killer named Reese, who is put to death for his crimes. Upon witnessing his execution, Hobbes continues on with his life until similar murders happen to catch his attention. It turns out that Reese was possessed by the demon, Azazel. Azazel is able to transfer himself from human to human simply by touching them, in most cases. So Azazel eventually finds himself a human host and begins another murder trail, confusing detectives by killing someone and leaving his hosts fingerprints and other evidence, then switching bodies and killing his previous host. As you can see, this can wreak havoc on a detective trying to solve these murders. Luckily, Azazel is more interested in exacting revenge on Hobbes than keeping his game a secret and lets Hobbes in on it, which is where the movie really takes off.The directing and camera work in this movie was superb. It was done in such a way where you can see Azazel's spirit go from person to person simply by following the camera up and down the crowd and watching the subtle touches one makes in a normal walk about town.Although this movie does require your full attention, it does not go unrewarded and you are not left at the end scratching your head wondering what had happened for the past 2 hours. All the answers to your questions are in there and that is why I think this movie is way above average. Why I have not heard of this movie before is beyond me.

John Goodman was excellent, James Gandolfini was pretty good, Donald Sutherland - great as always. The plot builds up nicely, and there is humanity to Washington's character that's very tangible. You realize what he's up against, and the hopelessness that tugs at him...and the scene where his brother dies - where his heart is on the verge of breaking, is very, very emotional.The only thing which did a great disservice to this movie - I feel - was the end.

If I were to become a martyr, I would make sure I would have killed the demon. Also, if Denzel's character's brother, ""Art,"" was mentally ill then the demon wouldn't have worked as well inside of him as it did in most people because he was mentally unstable and the mythology behind this demon talks about how mentally unstable pantients could regain control because their minds are broken making it difficult for the demon to make a connection with it's host.",Fallen

I have to say, the ending of the film left me feeling a little less than happy, although it rounded off the story well and had no faults, I hadn't worked 'it' out – leaving me annoyed with the film, whilst loving it at the same time.The main character, Hobbes, played by Denzel Washington, is a well-portrayed detective. He has a troubled family back home, which we don't find out about – we simply have to infer from the information Hoblit has allowed us. This theme of not being spoon-fed information carries throughout the story, with major events being left down to us to analyse and try to find an answer for. This simply adds to the effectiveness of the film. John Goodman, playing Jonesy, was surprisingly good at his role. When we were first introduced to this character, I had my doubts about how well he would be played, and how well he would fit into the storyline, however he did fit in, and especially at the end, he played a key part in the story (a.k.a he wasn't just the fat friend, there to prove Hobbes' humanity)",Fallen

215,paul_laidlaw-1,Disgraceful product placement sequence,7,4 January 2006,"Whilst I don't like it, I can usually live with product placement, as you could argue it's a necessary evil needed to scrape together funding for a film that would otherwise not have been made. However, did anyone else find the scene where Gandolfini and Washington were arguing over beers utterly unacceptable? For me, it was the worst example of product placement I've seen.Not content with just having the product on display, paying movie going punters are forced to put up with about two minutes of this nonsense that has no point to the plot of the film whatsoever. I loved the message of that little sequence:1) 'It's just a bud' ( implying honest, down to earth, good ol' American beer )2) Evil, wretched, ugly badman Gandolfini ( before his public reputation was deservedly transformed to cool Gangster in The Sopranos ) unreasonably attacks this American mainstay and even worse, recommends foreign muck! Thankfully, he is suitably chastised for this and made to look like a fool.3) Money shot of Hero Washington supping up those cold suds (side on profile in a warm golden glow ) with the knowledge he is drinking the best beer in the world.I hate advertisers. They spoil it for everyone and insulted the integrity of this film.Other than that, I liked this film.Can anyone else think of any worse product placement sequences?",Fallen
216,jhnadr,Why isn't the narrator a cat?,8,21 November 2020,"So the narrator is a demon in possession of Denzel's body and therefor also in possession of his sexy voice. But if the narrator is telling a story that has already taken place, and that story ends with him being forced out of Denzel's body into a cat's body, then how come the narrator still speaks with Denzel's voice instead of speaking only in meow-meows?
Still a good movie though.",Fallen
217,bentoo,A very good movie that nobody saw.,9,29 March 2006,"This is my 2nd viewing of The Fallen. I saw it 2001 & where I really enjoyed it I must have been preoccupied because I didn't remember much more than the basics. I remembered it as a Sci-Fi movie & forgot many of the scenes etc. But that was to my advantage on the second viewing as it was a lot of fun to see again. I wouldn't want to spoil the movie by explaining my favorite scenes & who would care anyway, but it was just creepy & supernatural enough to please & make watching fun. I'm surprised it didn't make a bigger splash than it did as the acting was first rate ( no Hamlet, but WTF!? ) & there were some big names in this movie. As far as the ending, I was happy with it! I get so tired of happy endings where everything gets sewn up into a neat package. Good guys win over evil, blah, blah, boring! Not everything is what you think it is right to the end. Very subtle & very well done. If they could do a sequel, which I normally hate, & do it well, Id like to see it.",Fallen
