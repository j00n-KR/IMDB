0,MartinHafer,"Well done...and depressing, depressing, depressing!",7,20 December 2011,"""Animal Kingdom"" is a highly respected Australian film that's apparently received a HUGE number of nominations for the Australian Film Awards--as well as an Oscar nomination for Jacki Weaver (as the matriarch of the family--who did a great job playing pure evil). And, I must say that technically speaking, it is a very good film. However, I must also say that it's a thoroughly unpleasant film that really had no payoff by the end. In many ways, it reminds me of ""Winter's Bone""--though I think ""Winter's Bone"" handles similar material in a better and much more satisfying way.The film centers on Josh (James Frecheville)--a very quiet and introverted young man who comes from an incredibly sick and twisted family. The film begins with his mother overdosing from drugs and he moves in with his grandmother and his uncles--and this new home is MUCH more destructive and sick! The uncles all sell drugs and are very violent men--and eventually the police home in on these sick folks and then things get REALLY crazy. I could say a lot more, but I don't want to ruin the suspense.While I like films that fight against convention and formula, I had a problem with this film that you perhaps might not. I wanted all this sickness and dysfunction to somehow work out for the good and for there to be SOME sense of meaning. Instead, the ending just reinforced the complete lack of meaning and left me very cold. Well made but VERY depressing and unsatisfying--it's hard to like a movie where you really don't like anyone.",Animal Kingdom
1,bkoganbing,Cody Family Values,7,27 February 2011,"A rather unsatisfactory conclusion to a grim story about an Australian family of professional criminals doesn't mar the fact that Animal Kingdom is one interesting piece of cinema. Topping the film is Jacki Weaver who was nominated for Best Supporting Actress, but lost in the Oscar sweepstakes to Melissa Leo for The Fighter who played a similar role as a family matriarch.I guess the best thing you can compare Jacki Weaver's part of 'Smurf' Cody is that of Ma Barker in the USA during the wild and woolly Depression Thirties who raised quite the criminal clan herself. I also have to say that as an American who gets constantly put upon for all the gun violence in this country is to see another country step up and admit they've got a big problem in that direction as well. Animal Kingdom was shot in Melbourne and from what I can see, Melbourne of 2011 stands close comparison to Chicago of the Thirties.Weaver's grandson James Frecheville comes to live with her after his mother takes a heroin overdose as she is his closest kin. Apparently dad isn't in the picture. Despite a lifestyle that did include some controlled substance abuse, Frecheville's mom did what she could to keep her kid away from her family. Now he gets an introduction to their way of life and it's quite the culture shock.Melbourne PD detective Guy Pearce takes some interest in the kid both personally and as a witness to bring the Codys to justice. American audiences probably know Pearce best from LA Confidential where he played an American LAPD detective from the Fifties. The Codys have their hooks into the Melbourne PD, but not with Pearce and his crowd who seem to have a private war with the Codys who are treated like the famous gangsters of the American Thirties with a shoot first and no questions asked and the hell with due process, however that's constituted in the Aussie legal system.Animal Kingdom gives foreign audiences a look at the dark underside of Australian criminal life. Weaver's performance is not to be missed.",Animal Kingdom
2,Leofwine_draca,Aussie thriller enlivened by good twists and performances,6,28 October 2016,"ANIMAL KINGDOM is another slice of gruelling nastiness that comes to us courtesy of our Australian cousins. It's not quite as downbeat and depressing as SNOWTOWN, although it gets close at times. This elaborate thriller is about a sprawling family of ne'er-do-wells and no-good criminals and what happens when a young and innocent relation is brought into the fold.It's not really the narrative that's important here, although there are a number of fresh situations and off-hand moments that make it stand out (that opener is a real clincher). It works best when delivering a series of shocks and sudden twists that the viewer certainly doesn't see coming. No, it's the characterisation where ANIMAL KINGDOM really shines; this is a film for actors, showcasing a number of realistic performances from the cast.Ben Mendelsohn is the one who really stands out in his star-making turn as the thoroughly creepy guy at the top of the chain, while Joel Edgerton and Sullivan Stapleton bring depth to their otherwise thuggish roles. James Frecheville plays it quiet and understated as the lead although the reliable Guy Pearce shines as a cop. Jacki Weaver may play one of the most understated and nasty characters ever. It's a decent film, certainly more compelling than most things Hollywood put out these days.",Animal Kingdom
3,SnoopyStyle,great acting in Australian crime drama,7,26 December 2015,"Seventeen year old Joshua ""J"" Cody (James Frecheville) is alone after his mother dies of a drug overdose. He seeks help from his maternal grandmother Janine ""Smurf"" Cody (Jacki Weaver) who takes him in. His mother had kept them away from her criminal mother and three brothers. Andrew ""Pope"" Cody (Ben Mendelsohn) is in hiding. Craig Cody (Sullivan Stapleton) is hyper. Darren Cody (Luke Ford) is barely older than J. Family friend Barry ""Baz"" Brown (Joel Edgerton) is the tough leader along with Pope. The cops keep surveillance on the family. Renegade cops shoots Baz dead sending the family into a spiral. After they ambush and kill two cops, police detective Nathan Leckie (Guy Pearce) takes J into custody for an interview.This is a great Australian crime drama. I wish Edgerton doesn't die so early in the movie. The acting is good all around with an exceptional performance from Jacki Weaver. It is dark and unrelenting. There are also a few funny moments like Pope ragging on his brother being gay. The main drawback of this movie is Frecheville. He doesn't have the charisma for a lead. He is surrounded by great actors acting circles around him. It's only his second acting credit and his character is suppose to be a blank. If he is a superior find, that would put the movie into the stratosphere.",Animal Kingdom
4,Hitchcoc,No Way Out!,8,22 May 2012,"I've seen so many movies recently that deal with the most claustrophobic existences imaginable. This is the story of a young man who has been dealt the worst of all possible hands. That had is bad enough, but to escape the implications, he must lean on a family which has brought loyalty to the n-th degree. There is a code that is so severe that to live by it is to subject yourself to hell. Expectations don't run toward anything positive but rather a maintenance of a violent status quo. I try not to be critical of subject matter. I really loved City of God. But at times it's so hopeless that it's hard to watch. Now for the positives. The acting is incredible, even though those portrayed are hardly admirable. The direction is riveting and moves toward a most dissatisfying conclusion. Of course, that conclusion is the way it has to be. See this at your own risk.",Animal Kingdom
5,nogodnomasters,IT'S OKAY TO CRY,8,20 July 2018,"17 year old Josh's mother dies from an OD which forces him to move back into his crime family. His grandmother (Jacki Weaver) is the Ma Barker type in that she stereotypically loves her boys perhaps a little too much in an unhealthy way. The beginning of the movie is filled with a lot of Josh's first person narration which introduces the characters as well as give us Josh's fatalist philosophy that is well beyond his age and maturity.His new family teaches him things he didn't learn living with his mother like: Washing your hands after you use the restroom, playing pull my finger, and using a gun for road rage. As a ""crime family"" they are rather unimpressive. Selling cocaine seems to be their major source of income and they have help with an inside man to do that. Josh wants out, but doesn't know how to do it.The film at times moves slow but is never dull. It is more drama than action. Josh (James Frecheville) is the main character and is seldom far from a scene.F-bomb. No sex or nudity.",Animal Kingdom
6,classicsoncall,"""I'm having trouble trying to find my positive spin.""",8,19 November 2018,"This is an effective story of a conflicted young man who turns to his crime family cousins after his own mother dies of a heroin overdose. Not a very promising start for the troubled teen. Joshua Cody's grandmother (Jacki Weaver) presents a compassionate and welcoming façade when 'J' seeks her out for refuge, but midway into the picture her personality takes a sinister turn. To state that the Cody family are a bunch of low lifes is to denigrate low lifes everywhere. While involved in street level drug dealing and extortion, they represent a situation to 'J' that threatens to spin out of control right after older brother Andrew 'Pope' Cody (Ben Mendelsohn) convinces him to jack a nondescript car in order to lure a couple of policemen into an ambush.Walking a razor's edge, Josh has a decision to make while balancing loyalty to his family and the fear that comes with living as an outlaw. When his girlfriend (Laura Wheelwright) is eliminated by Pope for the little that she knows about the Cody family business, the tightrope he walks becomes even narrower. Despite outreach from a sympathetic police detective (Guy Pearce), but not knowing who to trust, Josh to decides to turn to his grandmother and the family's sleazy attorney for counseling out of his predicament. All the while, you can tell that the wheels are turning inside Josh's troubled mind, and the attempt by his defense attorney to coach him as a discredited witness appears to put him back in good graces with Grandma 'Smurf'.A questionable aspect of the story line to my mind involves the death of Josh's girlfriend 'Nicky'. She dies as a result of a 'hotshot' injection of heroin administered by Pope. Because Josh hadn't been going with her for any length of time, it was quite possible to my mind that she could have been a drug user without Josh's knowledge. So when Josh agrees to testify that he believed Pope killed her without actually witnessing the event to set himself up as an unreliable witness, he really couldn't have been certain about the truth of the matter. His judgment following the acquittal of his two cousins relied on gut instinct to seek revenge on Pope, and by association, his own grandmother. But he actually could have been wrong. As the viewer, we only know that he was right about Pope because we were privy to the circumstances of Nicky's murder. Unless Pope's brother Darren (Luke Ford) filled in the blanks for Josh off screen, which again, is not made transparent in the story.",Animal Kingdom
7,jboothmillard,Animal Kingdom,7,17 July 2011,"I heard that this Australian film was a big hit at the cinema, and it was rated five stars out of five by the critics, so I had to see if I was going to agree with them. Basically seventeen year old Joshua 'J' Cody (James Frecheville) has been pretty much chucked out of his Melbourne based family, despite certain members having criminal backgrounds themselves. After J witnesses her mother Julia overdose and die from a heroin overdose, and feeling slightly detached reconnects with grandmother Janine 'Smurf' Cody (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Jacki Weaver) and lives with her. She is the matriarch, but has an incestuous love with her three sons, quiet but menacing Andrew 'Pope' Cody (Ben Mendelsohn), hyperactive Craig Cody (Sullivan Stapleton) and not very old Darren Cody (Luke Ford). Pope and best friend Barry 'Baz' Brown (Joel Edgerton) do armed robberies, with Darren as apprentice, and Craig deals drugs, and with Pope in hiding the Melbourne Armed Robbery Squad are after him. The standoff between the Squad and the Codys is taken up a level, and a war starts to emerge, with innocent people and J, who only finds ground with girlfriend Nicky Henry (Laura Wheelwright), caught in amongst it. Homicide Detective Senior Sergeant Nathan Leckie (Guy Pearce) knows the Codys are involved in some of the deaths, he tries to get J on his side, but he is more interested in getting himself out of the situation, he trusts neither side. Also J wants to exact justice as he considers putting right all things in the bad situation, and in the end I presume he does, to be honest, I didn't understand everything going on. Also starring Dan Wyllie as Ezra White and Anthony Hayes as Detective Justin Norris. If it wasn't for the fact that I couldn't figure out what was going on I may have agreed with the high rating by the critics, certainly there are some eye-catching moments, good acting, and I guess a good script, so it is certainly not a crime drama you would want to miss. Very good!",Animal Kingdom
8,Quinoa1984,a bleak story of a family suffused in crime. is there any other way to go down?,9,28 August 2010,"Animal Kingdom reclaims the mantle that a TV series like The Sopranos had for a while: taking a family and dissecting what makes them tic, as realistically (or believably) as possible in a dramatic setting. The Cody family in general is screwed up from a birthright; the mother of the family, Janine (Jacki Weaver), smiles and gives hugs and kisses to her sons as they do all kinds of ill-s***, and will do anything to save her own sons if it comes down to it (by this, other family members can go by the wayside). The sons that she has vary from being downright sinister like 'Pope' (Ben Mendehlson), who as the story goes on is increasingly paranoid over his dear young nephew, or Darren, who just goes with the flow of things but has a little more of a conscience than Pope. Their problems are all made by themselves, and it grows less complex for them morally- and only more and more for the one we see the story mostly through, J (James Frecheville)- as crimes mount and paranoia and police pressure continues.The air of this movie is thick with a kind of collective fear of the characters, hidden mostly by their criminal pride (as J notes in his narration, they know they're doomed as soon as they get into it), which adds a whole level of intensity to the main performances. Mendehlson especially nails the desperate but twisted perspective of the character: a stone-cold killer who has no qualms about anything he's doing. One thing he, as well as the rest of the family, lack that the Sopranos didn't necessarily was a sense of humor. There's a scene where Pope is just sitting at the couch while a couple other people are asleep and is watching a music video. Something about his gaze is frightening (part of it, too, is the way the camera pans dollies up to his face, ""I'm all out of love, so lost without you"" blaring in the background), and it perpetrates what the characters, the good ones and the bad ones, will go through in the run time. The film is a not-entirely spare, not-over-the-top portrayal of this family, tinged with the brooding music by Antony Partos that gives even the quiet scenes a menace that is unmistakable. I most responded to how the first-time director David Michod not only didn't shy away from the darkness in the story and the characters, he embraces it. There's no such hope for any of the characters here, one of whom, J's girlfriend Nicky, is doomed just by her being in the presence of her (mostly) innocent boyfriend, who is only with these criminals because of his mother's sudden death from heroin. From that first scene, as J sits stone-faced at the TV with her right by his side deceased, that there will be little hope. Even in moments where it looks like things might turn out for the better, we know by the mood Michod sets up - and specifically how J's dear blue-steel-eyed grandmother sets things in motion in the last act - how this is the only way it *could* be. It's a staggering portrait of mistrust and familial skulduggery.The only significant problem I had with the film was the acting by its sort-of lead, Frecheville. He plays a character so detached emotionally you'd think he were trying out for Camus' the Stranger. Perhaps it was the way to go in a way, that he's shell-shocked through much of the story because of how bleak everything is and even the seemingly happy moments (a scene at a diner) is broken up by tension (""no smoking"" moment). But he was so removed that I started to be taken out of the mood of the piece and just kept focusing on how set apart from the other actors he is. Maybe some will respond positively to his young stoicism. I kept seeing a kid who was an inert actor; only once or twice does he really let it all out, and it's only because the script tells him to. He can't rise to the standard that's set by actors like Guy Pearce and especially Weaver, though the latter gives a Oscar-worthy performance, if that means anything.But his acting being a flaw should not take away from what is so amazing about Animal Kingdom. It's harsh and cold and brutal and when there's violence it's sudden and shocking because of somewhat suspense and also the nature of how the characters commit the violence. This director knows what's he's doing and has a mature enough vision of the hell that a family puts itself through by the whole ""We're a family! Deal with it!"" code that the Cody's have. I can only hope the film gets some good distribution in the US; next to the Killer Inside Me it's the best ""nasty"" crime movie of the year.",Animal Kingdom
9,Theo Robertson,Too Bleak To Be Enthralling,6,3 May 2013,"I caught this on Film4 and knew absolutely nothing about it but the info button rated it 3.5 stars out of 4 which is a very high rating for a film appearing on a cable channel . Since I knew nothing about it I gave this page a quick glance to get a handle on what I was going to be watching . It received an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress , swept the board at the Aussie version of the Oscars and garnered lots of critical international acclaim . It doesn't alter one thing and that is ANIMAL KINGDOM is unknown in Britain and there's a lack of prolific British contributors singing its praises . Surely if it's such a good film us poms would have heard of it ? After seeing ANIMAL KINGDOM in full I can state it's a relatively well made film but no masterpiece . It's summed up by its opening sequence where a teenage boy finds his mother dead due to a heroin overdose and after that little comedy interlude the film gets more serious . In fact the whole film seems more concerned by depressing the audience rather than compelling them . There's little in the way of sympathetic characterisation and the amount of people who use the adjective of "" depressing "" on this page tells you all ou need to know about the tone of the movie",Animal Kingdom
10,LeonLouisRicci,Very Good Crime Family Story From Austrailia,8,7 December 2014,"Methodical Madness of a Crime Family from Down Under.

12,view_and_review,Matriarch Made the Movie,7,18 November 2021,"I've never watched the TV show ""Animal Kingdom,"" but if it's based upon the movie then I may want to take a gander.""Animal Kingdom"" takes place in Australia. The main subjects of the movie are a criminally active family with a very approving mother. Things get thick when one of her son's (Joel Edgerton) is murdered by the police and his brothers take revenge. Joshua 'J' Cody (James Frecheville), their nephew, gets mixed up in it all because he now has to stay with them since his mother OD'ed on heroin.The movie is intense at times, and dragging at other times. I think that a lot of the drama could've been avoided if the oldest brother, Andrew 'Pope' Cody (Ben Mendelsohn), wasn't so epically stupid. It's actually kind of weird how dumb he was considering he seemed like a clever criminal.When he and his brother Darren (Luke Ford) went to assassinate a couple of cops they left their nephew J at home. They came back and told J nothing of the crime though he could easily gather what they had done. When the police interrogated J he didn't know what to say because he was never told what to say. The police let them all go because they had nothing solid, and they would never have anything solid because even though J was a teenager and therefore the weak link, he never saw anything. But, for whatever reason, Pope thought that J would be his undoing and went out of his way to make sure J didn't talk to the cops. It amazed me how it didn't occur to Pope that J couldn't say anything to put him away because he never partook in the crime. The most J could say was, ""My uncles left at such-and-such a time and they came back x amount of hours later."" That's it, and that's if he was feeling talkative.That was my biggest gripe with the film which seemed to be the most crucial part of the plot. In essence, if Pope was never wary of J, then there'd be no movie--or the movie would've been significantly shorter. Even with that glaring flaw I liked it. The mother/grandmother (Jacki Weaver) was something else. She made the movie for me.",Animal Kingdom
13,evanston_dad,This Mother Could Teach Mrs. Bates a Thing or Two,9,23 August 2011,"In ""Animal Kingdom,"" a group of petty criminal brothers spiral out of control as they feel the noose of the law tighten around their collective throats. A nephew, newly adopted by the family after the death of his mother, becomes an object of suspicion to the family and emerges as the key witness to the murder of some police officers orchestrated by the oldest and craziest brother. Meanwhile, the boys' mother, sweet, loving and perhaps even a little bit daffy, sits in the background and gives her boys a loving pat or a rather too-intimate and creepy kiss when circumstances get them down.Then mid-way through the film, we get some insight into the character of the mother, and suddenly everything that has come before is not only seen in a different light but also makes much more sense. We realize that we've been watching a bunch of scared little boys who are trying their best to behave like men, while the mother, far from being a passive observer of her sons' criminal activities, reveals herself to be the iciest and most ruthless of them all. It's not a big plot twist in the traditional sense, but it nevertheless serves the same purpose as one, energizing the film while surprising the audience.Thus it's Jacki Weaver, as the mother, who raises ""Animal Kingdom"" a notch above the standard issue crime thriller. The writing and directing are solid and the other performances are uniformly fine (especially from that old reliable Guy Pearce, as the chief investigator), but it's Weaver, able to terrify while calling you ""love,"" who you will remember.

14,ferguson-6,"You've Done Some Bad Things, Sweetie",8,29 August 2010,"Greetings again from the darkness. An Australian movie that packs a wallop! Writer/Director David Michod delivers an unsettling look into one family's life of crime and corresponding order of things - the circle of life in the Animal Kingdom. Supposedly based on a true story, this is a tough family that you would not want as neighbors. These aren't Scorcese's smooth operators from ""Casino"" or ""Goodfellas"". No, these guys are worse.The matriarch is played chillingly by Jacki Weaver. She is mother or grandmother to the guys (except for one outsider) in the band of crooks. While she messes with your mind through the story, it's not until the final 15 minutes when she really kicks it up a notch and becomes flat out frightening in her power.There are only a couple of actors that most people would recognize. Joel Edgerton plays the outsider in the group, and the one trying to go straight by playing the stock market with his ""earnings"". The other is Guy Pearce, who plays the detective trying to both solve the cases and rescue young Josh, played by newcomer James Frecheville.Not only is this the type of story that sucks you in, it is a reminder of just how distracting movie stars can be a to film. The lack of stars allows us to really be absorbed into this family, or better, this world of crime, deceit, corruption and paranoia. There is not a single superstar who appears - one who can capitalize on his film history of characters and immediately generate recognition. Here, the viewer must get to know an entire family for who and what they are. This is powerful stuff for a film lover.The winner for best psychopath is Ben Mendelsohn as Pope. His dead eyes will scare you. His demeanor will scare you. His actions will disgust you. There are two lines in the film that help us make sense of what occurs. Early on, the narrator tells us that ""all crooks come undone"" at some point. Later, the detective (Pearce) tells us that in the Animal Kingdom, you are either weak or strong. The lines seems pretty clear.The focus of the film is on Josh (Frecheville) who gets plopped into this family of criminals after his mom dies of an overdose and he calls his grandmother (Weaver). Josh spends the rest of the film trying to blend in while staying clean. Of course, even his stoic mask doesn't save him from the path of destruction created by Pope.In the end, the film is about survival, adaptation and defining what really defines strong and weak, good and bad. If you enjoy powerful crime thrillers, this one is worth checking out ... and be appreciative for the lack of Hollywood star power. That's part of why it works!",Animal Kingdom
15,gradyharp,Survival of the Fittest,8,1 March 2011,"ANIMAL KINGDOM is tough little film from Australia, well written and directed by David Michôd, and acted by a fine ensemble cast of actors. It is a frightening tale of crime and corruption, of one family of criminal sociopaths both pitted against and partnered by the police in Melbourne, Australia. Though the film wanders times, altering past and present in a manner that proves confusing to the whole, the impact in the end is stunning. Joshua ""J"" Cody (James Frecheville) narrates the film and we first meet this young 17-year-old sitting beside his mother who has just died from an overdose of heroin. In a most detached way he calls his maternal grandmother Smurf (Jacki Weaver) and asks if she remembers him: his mother has been estranged from her family for years. Smurf welcomes his call and complies with his desire to move to her home. And what a home she runs! Smurf's sons are sociopathic criminals on the run from the law (but also involved with the law in the illegal sale of drugs with bad cops). The worst offender is Pope (Ben Mendelsohn) who is the brains behind the crimes the family commits: he is also on medication for his mental challenge. The other two brothers are drug-addled Craig (Sullivan Stapleton) and the strange very young Darren (Luke Ford). Pope's best friend in crime is the rather tender Baz (Joel Edgerton) with whom J can relate. J is thus thrust into the family he has not known and becomes reluctantly involved with the criminal shenanigans and killings of Smurf's boys. Smurf has a bizarre relationship with her 'gang' of sons, seemingly kind and protective but with a surprising evil side of her own. As the story progresses J is caught between the family and the police - in the form of Investigator Leckie (Guy Pearce, in another memorable role) - and the story deals with how this contrasting set of circumstances molds the young J. There isn't a weak link in the cast and after viewing the film it is understandable why Jacki Weaver was nominated for an Oscar. This is a different sort of crime drama and the flavor of the Australian setting adds immeasurably to the mood. Grady Harp",Animal Kingdom
16,Sylviastel,Jacki Weaver is the scene stealer!,8,28 January 2012,"Jacki Weaver earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress for her role as Janine ""Smurf"" Cody, the matriarch of a criminal family in Melbourne, Australia. The film begins with the death of her daughter and her grandson, Josh known as Jay, who moves in with his mother's family. J doesn't know much about his mother's family but he begins to know why his mother kept them away and estranged for years. His mother's family led by the amazing Jacki Weaver in the role of the grandmother and mother is a bit incestuous when she asks her son for a kiss which is disturbing. We learn that J's uncles are notoriously criminal in their behavior with a mother who does nothing to deter them. The family is quite a dysfunctional bunch when J enters into the situation. He is caught between the cops, the law, morality, and his family. Anyway, Jacki Weaver is fantastic and I hope to see more of her but her character won't get mother of the year.",Animal Kingdom
17,lasttimeisaw,Animal Kingdom: 7/10,7,4 January 2011,"An earthy story of how a LION KING is born in an Australian pusher family. I think it is a brave film in spite of its comfortless representation. The film is surrounded by a sullen emotion since its very beginning, a young boy was watching the TV while while his dead mother was lying beside him in the sofa. The instant feeling was that this boy must be exceptional in some ways. Then we witnessed the downhill of a matrilineal criminal family, until the final moment (literally in the end), I could be relieved to see the young stud has metamorphosed to be the new backbone of the family (otherwise the film would be so depressed). Writer and the first-time director David Michod actually did a great job, the thriller tension is excellently built, though the camera work is somewhat biased toward inexpertness, which creates some uneasiness for spectators. The score is repetitious each time the suspenseful moments are near (with an unimaginative melody). The film began as a Sundance winner, and swept 2010 Australian Film Institute Awards too, and now buzz for Jacki Weaver's coming Oscar nomination is strong, I do adore her performance and I think she deserves an nomination (not my win though), especially the sharp tenacity and cruelness under her sweet voice, also the mother fixation between her and her sons is well exposed. Ben Mendelsohn deserves some recognition as well as the creepy and vicious uncle; as for the new-comer James Frecheville, his performance is comparatively prosaic, I cannot sense the changeover of his character, which is a major disappointment for me. It's a brave Aussie indie film and does add some fresh air into the over-crowded gangster/police thriller genre, good luck in the Oscars (a supporting actress and a screenplay nomination should be highly possible)!",Animal Kingdom
18,sddavis63,A Hard Edged Film About One Family's Life Of Crime,8,7 February 2011,"This Australian film packs quite a wallop. It both begins and ends on appropriately stone cold notes. In the beginning, Josh (James Frecheville) is sitting and watching a game show on television, having just called for paramedics to come and get his mother, who's died of a heroin overdose. There's no emotion in the scene; just a 17 year old kid who's obviously seen his mom strung out before and for whom this is no real surprise. Julia (the mom) plays no real part in the story (except to die) but comes across as a sympathetic figure in spite of everything. If nothing else, for all her problems, she kept Josh away from her crime riddled family. After her death, and with nowhere else to turn, Josh contacts his maternal grandmother, with whom he's had no contact for years, and begins to get sucked into the life of crime that his mother seems to have shielded him from.Jacki Weaver was great as the grandmother. She's cheerful and loving (perhaps overly so in fact) on the surface, but stone cold and ruthless inside - a character trait that becomes clear once Josh gets taken by the police into witness protection and becomes a threat to the family after his uncles ""deal"" with his girlfriend, who they began to see as a threat in case Josh had told her anything.The life of crime is realistically portrayed. There are drugs and a pretty vicious cop-killing that takes place, and a very hard-edged film leads up to a stone cold ending that rivalled or exceeded the stone cold beginning. The uncles having been acquitted, a now stone cold Josh moves back in with his grandmother to ""deal"" with the uncle who ""dealt"" with his girlfriend. It's a tough movie and it's a very good movie. That stone cold opening intrigues and draws the viewer in from the start, and while it may go on a little bit too long, it never loses its power and its hold.",Animal Kingdom
19,Hellmant,Rivals some of Hollywood's best!,8,27 October 2010,"'ANIMAL KINGDOM': Four Stars (Out of Five)   This critically acclaimed Australian crime film rivals some of  Hollywood's best. It's a dark and violent tale revolving around a  teenage youth caught in the middle of a destructive criminal family.  The film is written and directed by David Michod, which marks his  fictional feature film debut, and also marks the feature debut of actor  James Frecheville in the lead role. The film also features a number of  veteran Australian character actors in supporting roles including Ben  Mendelsohn, Luke Ford, Joel Edgerton and Anthony Hayes (which the  latter two were recently seen together in the Austrailian film noir  thriller 'THE SQUARE') as well as Guy Pearce and an award worthy  performance from Jacki Weaver.  Frecheville plays Joshua 'J' Cody, a seventeen year old who recently  lost his mother to a drug overdose. He contacts his grandmother Janine  Cody (Weaver), who's mother had a falling out with many years earlier,  and she takes him in to her home. He's then exposed to his three  criminal uncles: Craig Cody ( Sullivan Stapleton), a drug dealer,  Andrew 'Pope' Cody (Mendelsohn), a bank robber who's best friend and ex  partner Barry Brown (Edgerton) is like part of the family, and Darren  Cody (Ford), who's barely older than 'J' and has been taken under the  two bank robbers wing. The authorities have been after 'Pope', who has  been hiding out from them for some time, and they escalate their  conflict by murdering Barry in cold blood. This sends 'Pope' and the  other brothers into a frenzy and they retaliate. Things spiral out of  control from there and 'J' is caught in the middle, especially when a  Detective (Pearce) tries to get him to turn on his family.  The movie is very dark and violent and set in a world that is probably  extremely unrelatable to most viewers but the character of 'J' is  relatable and that's why the movie works so well. He's extremely soft  spoken and introverted and wishes for nothing more than a normal life  and to leave his crazy family behind. He finds some happiness with his  girlfriend Nicky (Laura Wheelwright) but when she's put into jeopardy  as well he resorts to his violent 'animal' side as well. The movie is  interesting, compelling and beautifully directed by Michod. I can't  wait to see what his sophomore project will be.",Animal Kingdom
20,dromasca,"in the style of the crime movies of the 70s, with a down under accent",7,20 August 2011,"The opening scene of 'Animal Kingdom' is awesome. A young man just on the eve of maturity and an older woman watch a brainless TV competition show. She seems to have fallen asleep on the sofa. Next paramedics from the emergency service enter. We understand the two are mother and son, and the mother fainted after injecting heroin. The paramedics try to resuscitate her. She actually was dead. The son continues to watch TV without any apparent emotion during all the scene, the eyes stuck to the empty content of the TV show.The scene is symbolic for the empty social and cultural world where the characters of the film move. We may be in the Melbourne of the first years of the 2000s but the story of the family could have taken place in any other time and place, and there are no cultural or moral drives in what the family of gangsters in the center of the story do, there is only the instinct that brings the family together in some kind of spirit of heard of predators, there is greed and there is revenge. In fact the film resembles and is visibly inspired by the Hollywood crime stories and we could easily imagine DeNiro or Pacino taking in the 70s many of the roles. The structure of the crime family is the same as in the traditional Sicilian mafia, with just one twist – the godfather figure is being taken here by the mother of the three bank robbers, but then we already had seen a similar role in Katheen Turner's Serial Mom which I bet the excellent Jacki Weaver had seen at least once. The rebellious sibyl is the mother who died in the opening scene and it is the fate of the son who is at stake in this film – will he go straight or will he end by being part of the family implacable destiny? The opening scene also is one of the many god moments in a film that never lets you guess it is director's David Michôd first feature film. To be true however to the end I need to say that the pace is sometimes slow and there are also some moments that let the viewers confused, and not only because of the accent the folks down under speak their variant of English which of course does not help. Overall it is however an entertaining story with a few surprises and turns that keep the attention of viewers, with an atmosphere of authenticity, and no moral judgments – cops do not show up in a much better light than criminals, with a group of rogue policemen taking the law in their hands and playing according to the gang rules the war with crime. The ending is one of the possible endings such movies may have and did not let me unsatisfied. Acting is good and as I know too little about Australian cinema I had the advantage of all actor faces being new to me. Besides Weaver that I already mentioned, I liked James Frecheville who does a fine job in his first lead role and Ben Mendelsohn (an experienced actor according to his IMDb record). Animal Kingdom is not a masterpiece, but is a smartly written and well acted film and I am not surprised that it caught the attention of the jury at the Sundance festival and that is enjoys a fair international success.",Animal Kingdom
21,tomgillespie2002,Deserves to be seen by more,9,11 August 2011,"When 17-year old J's (James Frecheville) mother dies from an overdose of heroin, he contacts his grandmother Janine 'Smurf' Cody (Jacki Weaver) who he's rarely seen and moves in with her. She lives there with her three violent sons, Craig (Sullivan Stapleton), Darren (Luke Ford), and Pope (Ben Mendelsohn), who are part of a large Melbourne crime family. When Pope's best friend is shot dead by police at point blank range, the three brothers decide to take revenge and murder a couple of police officers. Things soon spiral out of control, and J is unwittingly dragged into a war between the brothers and the police.If there was one word to describe this film, it would be brutal. Not in the overly-violent, exploitative way, but in the way that the film can deliver a sudden burst of violence that is both realistic and unpleasant. This is a seriously tough drama. Where most films become more exciting when action starts, Animal Kingdom just gets darker and more tense. And that is where its power lies. The film draws you in and leaves you waiting at the end of your nerve while you wait to see what happens to these basically nasty characters next. Yet even when you're half-expecting something to happen, it still manages to hit you with a shotgun blast that comes out of nowhere.The main strength of the film is the stellar acting. Jacki Weaver received an Academy Award nomination for her portrayal of a woman that is as powerful using her mouth and brain as her sons are with their guns and intimidation, and she is brilliant in the role. Relative newcomer Frecheville brilliantly underplays his role as a quiet teenager suddenly drawn into a world of violence and danger, and really comes into his own two-thirds into the film. But the obvious stand-out is Ben Mendelsohn as the terrifying Pope. At first glance, he appears to be a non- threatening, slightly weird looking middle aged man. But those eyes are filled with evil and mental instability. This is a 'bad guy' who is genuinely psychopathic, and is more threatening when he's being nice to you. He is reckless, evil and conniving. In most scenes, you don't know if he's genuinely being nice or waiting to strangle a character. His performance is simply stunning.I'm very disappointed that this film hasn't been raved about more. Sure, it's critically-acclaimed, but it should be seen by more people. I've never felt a film has been so criminally underrated since 2005's outstanding The Proposition (coincidentally also an Australian film starring Guy Pearce). This film stayed with me for long after the credits rolled. Even though this world of drug-dealing and casual violence seemed alien to me, the story of isolation and fear can be felt by everyone. Highly recommended.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",Animal Kingdom

23,howard.schumann,An experience you will not soon forget,9,16 February 2011,"""Crooks always come undone, always, one way or another"" – Joshua CodyUnwilling to glamorize predatory criminals as in other well-known crime films, David Michod's gritty Animal Kingdom portrays an Australian family of drug dealers and bank robbers as they are, disturbed sociopaths without a trace of conscience. Winner of the Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival, this low-key thriller is a crime drama, a psychological case study, and a coming of age story about a young boy trying to get through his teenage years without being scarred for life by the people around him, none of whom he can trust. The film will hold you in a vise from its opening moment until its unpredictable ending.Narrated years later by Joshua Cody (James Frecheville), known as J, the opening scene creates the mood for what will follow. J lounges on his sofa watching both the TV game show ""Deal or No Deal"" and the paramedics working on his mother, slumped beside him after having OD'd on drugs. The boy is expressionless and acts as if he's on another planet, having tuned out the unpleasant things in this world. When his mother dies, he has no choice other than to call his grandmother Janine (Jacki Weaver), known as ""Grandma Smurf,"" the matriarch of a group of social misfits whose kisses on her boys' lips and cheery ways belie a darker undercurrent.No longer shielded from the family by his mother, J is thrown into the middle of a blood feud between his uncles and the corrupt Armed Robbery Squad, cops who believe that the law was invented for them to take into their own hands. The charming set of characters that J has to deal with is as clear an example of the banality of evil as ever hit the screen. Not particularly bright or larger than life, they are ordinary human beings with serious problems and the police are not exemplary citizens either. J's mentors include drug dealer Craig Cody (Sullivan Stapleton), the passive, uncommunicative Darren (Luke Ford), and the peach of the lot, Pope (Ben Mendelsohn), a mumbling sociopath who has just returned from hiding and fears the police are targeting him.Also part of the gang is Barry Brown, known as ""Baz"" (Joel Edgerton), a bank robber who tells them in an unguarded moment, ""Our game is over. It's getting too hard."" Gracious on the outside but ruthless on the inside, Grandma ""Smurf"" offers little protection for J from the colony of predators around him. His only connection to sanity is his girlfriend Nicky (Laura Wheelwright) and her family, with whom he spends more and more time with, especially after an act of police violence kills a member of the clan while sitting in his car. When Pope tells J to steal a car and bring it to him at 2:00 AM, J, however, becomes more deeply involved. Forced to participate in a revenge ambush that leaves two cops dead, he becomes the target of an investigation led by detective Nathan Leckie (Guy Pearce), one of the few ""good cops"" in the film.After Leckie brings him in for questioning, the paranoid Pope and the rest of the family assume that he has spilled the beans. After another gruesome killing of someone close to him, J is forced to choose between loyalty to his brothers, his fear of corrupt cops, and his willingness to trust a detective who thinks he can protect him. Supported by a haunting electronic score by Anthony Partos, Animal Kingdom maintains a feeling of tension right from the get-go, its calm exterior belying the menace underneath. With naturalistic performances that make you feel as if the action is happening in your living room, the film is not an easy watch, but it is an experience you will not soon forget.",Animal Kingdom
24,TheMovieDiorama,Animal Kingdom unleashes an unfaltering roar across Australia.,8,11 November 2019,"The animal kingdom, a hierarchical group of biological creatures that zoologically determine species that are predacious by nature or hunted down by those stronger than them. It is the laws of nature, Darwinism, that the mighty feed on the weak. Natural selection. We, specifically as human apex predators, do what we must in order to increase our survivability odds. For the Cody family, a familial crime syndicate based in Melbourne, that results in suppressing even the most friendly of noises. Their successful drug-distribution has enabled them to purchase a myriad of luxuries in life, including a quaint abode where seventeen year-old Josh stays after his mother overdoses on heroin. With no alternative shelter, he nestles into the heart of the Cody family tree, commanded by the sweet innocent matriarch who'd do anything and everything to see her boys home and safe.Michôd based this fictitious story on the Pettingill family, where a pair of brothers were acquitted for slaughtering two police officers at point blank range. Offering an apt yet palpable string of tension that questions the utilisation of firearms, a measure to prevent anarchy not commence it, and the lengths a family will partake in for the sake of hereditary aggregation. His screenplay is smart, boasting a range of unexpectedly intelligent character choices that defy typical tropes within other comparative gangster features. If a main character bravely meets their early demise, it's executed with no padding or fuss. Bang! Suddenly, Michôd moves on. An irrefutably powerful and perceptible technique that accompanied the meticulously concise script that he had written.The Cody family members are developed substantially, with their affection for each other explicitly displayed for added finesse. The line between psychopathy and scrupulous behaviour is depicted through the character of ""Pope"". His outrageous criminal activity tests the loyalty of his brothers whilst embedding a commanding presence within the family. We may view the shenanigans through Josh's innocent perspective, yet somehow Michôd transforms these detestable characters into, well, protagonists. His attentive detail in illustrating the affectionate bonds within the family, instantly adds a light touch of self-justification for their crimes. Impeccably clever, to turn a group of murderous individuals into something more affable.None of this though would've been possible without the sensational performances all-round, with three highlights in particular. Mendelsohn showed the world how brutal his antagonistic capabilities can be, with an arresting performance that cemented his talents almost immediately. Pearce, portraying the ""good cop"" by convincing Josh not to become a criminal, balances the ethical and moral dilemmas that the main character encounters with a soothingly calm performance. Then Weaver, capitalising on her sweet demeanour, venomously encourages the family through her captivating matriarchal performance. The Brando of Melbourne, perhaps?Frecheville lacked emotional conviction, mostly offering a monotonously one-dimensional approach, that forced his uncles to be more enticing as individuals. Occasionally Doolan's sublime editing consequently resulted in the script feeling somewhat scattershot, particularly in the second act, where the tension dissipated after the shopping centre scene. The introduction of the family's barrister before the court hearing was also spontaneous, resulting in Phillips' performance being less than impressive.Still, Animal Kingdom is quite simply one of Australia's greatest exports. Tight, taut and packed full of explosive performances that provide an animalistic bite to this crime story. A rejuvenated modern-take on the classic gangster formula.",Animal Kingdom
25,imseeg,Violence breeds more violence,8,16 April 2018,"Family of criminals goes down the drain on a path of violence. Really that's all there's to it. ""Animal Kingdom"" is a barrage of violence upon violence. It is structured and acted in a way that makes it feel as if it were a true story, because the performances by the actors are so believable. I read the notes and it seems to be partly inspired by true events. The almost documentary approach in filming hightened this feeling of watching a ""fly on the wall"" documentary. All this realism made me react intenser to the characters than I would normally do.For example I really loathed the guy who was the head of the family, because of his inbread instinct to solve any problem with a killing spree. What he did was just plain repulsive killing for revenge and to silence witnesses to his crimes. No fun to watch. Fascinating nonetheless. Dont watch this if you like to see some heroic type of violence. The type of violence in ""Animal Kingdom"" is like a kick in your guts. Director David Michod has got a knick for making movies full of violence that make me feel depressed. Still it is a very good portrayal of what violence does: it breeds more violence. And for that quality and for the real life portrayal by the actors I highly recommend this picture. David Michod's films are the best antidote for the usual hollywood glorification of violence. 8 stars.",Animal Kingdom
26,videorama-759-859391,One mad kingdom is our garden state city,9,20 March 2014,"Despite it's intriguing title, although we're not in Africa, but inner city Melbourne, during a more frightening time, when murder was really up, here was a crime tale, a true one, that I finally got around to watching and I must say I was surprisingly, tastily, gratefully entertained, during the whole engrossing affair. Next to Snowtown, these were the two best Aussie films I've seen in years, both winners, and rightfully, deservedly so. James Frenchville, as J., a fish out of water, here is taken under his Auntie's (Mama Smurf) wing, when his mother o.d's. He then soon realizes of the madness surrounding him, involving Smurf's out of control sons, one of them spiralling into madness, after a revenge execution of his brother by some avenging and shady police. What follows is a revenge attack of three young innocent cops to make a point. Jay is taken in, where he's questioned by a well meaning detective, (Pearce, solid and likable in the role, one of the strongest actually) where to honor family or to avoid real possibility chance of being bumped off by his crime family tree, this messed up teen must lie his way out, and J isn't a really convincing liar. Soon he finds himself in a really dangerous situation, where as things heat up more, he must choose, where he opts to go into witness protection, which with Pearce and his yahoos, doesn't really inspire security. Pearce's family here, had an interesting character touch, where's he leads a simple life with wifie, his little girl, autistic in this. Weaver stars in the role of her lifetime as the manipulative Judy Moran (Mama Smurf) where taken as noticeable acting commodity by Hollywood, inspires actors to never give up, or realize it's not too late to be noticed by those people. The build up to the end is not as you expect, with a nasty twist in it's finale, if also disappointing aspect from Jay's change of heart. Animal Kingdom is one movie I really enjoyed with a stellar heavy weight, cast, where Mendelsohn's AFI award winning role as the real messed up brother of the family, is nothing short of acting brilliance. It's an intensely driven film with some real suffocatingly scary moments, in a film that is so darn entertaining, your eyes will never leave the screen.",Animal Kingdom

When this boy's mom dies of a heroism overdose, he's force to seek shelter with the fam he was told to stay clear of.The oldest brother was played brilliantly as a paranoid psychopath quietly going over the deep end.

28,Chris Knipp,No one to trust,9,22 August 2010,"'Animal Kingdom' is a film about the meltdown of a criminal family but also a hair-raising coming of age tale. This stunning feature film debut by the Australian director-writer David Michôd has been compared to Scorsese's 'Goodfellas,' and also to Greek tragedy, or an epic. But if you are paying close attention, and it's hard not to, comparisons won't occur to you, if at all, till later. What dominates is an overwhelming awareness of how afraid everybody is, how unpredictable and crazy is the world they live in and perpetuate. Michôd creates an effect that's contemporary and immediate, without glamorous or referential filmic effects. The action is continually tense and absorbing. The strength of his film is in that. It grabs you and holds you. The down side is a certain lack of grace notes or elegance of design. But the effect is exhilarating. It's great to be swept away like this, and the audience when I watched applauded at the end.We begin with Joshua, known as ""J"" (James Frecheville), a big, towering 17-year-old whose quiet, deadpan voice limns in the family he's just become a close part of due to the death of his heroin-addict mother. His blonde grandmother Smurf Cody (Jacki Weaver) hasn't spoken with J's mother for years, but she comes to rescue him and brings him to live with the rough gang of her four burly and scary criminal sons, his estranged uncles, of whom she is the den mother and matriarch -- almost the lover: she kisses them on the mouth. We meet the dangerous Pope (Ben Mendelsohn), a bank robber and nut case off his meds, recently out of prison and hiding from the cops; the rough but business-savvy Baz (Joel Edgerton), who wants to go legit and become a stock broker; the brutish tattoo-covered Craig (Sullivan Stapleton), a drug dealer and heavy user; the brawny but introverted, relatively spineless Darren (Luke Ford). Smurf seems to set a warmer, more human note amid this macho brood, but turns out to be deeper than anyone into the spirit of betrayal and deception that pollutes the atmosphere. At first Pope is hiding out and isn't seen. Then he joins the household again and becomes the principal menace.There's neither heroism nor goodness in this world, and hardly any sense of structure. J describes his relatives as ""criminals,"" with no hint of gangland alliances. Michôd has described Melbourne's crime scene as not restricted to any ghetto or enclave, and the Codys live in an ordinary modern suburb of the city. The Cody boys are bank robbers and drug dealers but at the moment more involved in a feud with the police, whose various departments are corrupt and out of touch with each other. No one is to be trusted. Everybody lies.The police armed-robbery squad is out of control. In a seemingly random cop assassination, they gun down Baz in broad daylight. Henceforth the family's meltdown begins. Pope, the eldest, most unhinged brother, has no rational check on him now, and takes over. At his instigation, two cops are killed at night investigating a stolen car. This was the starting point of the script Michôd worked on for eight years, based on a true Melbourne incident that occurred in 1988.After the double cop-killing, J is picked up and questioned by Detective Nathan Leckie (Guy Pearce). The youth doesn't reveal anything, but he does talk, spinning a simple alibi to cover his own involvement. This is a mistake, as far as Pope is concerned: J should have said nothing. From then on Pope no longer trusts the boy, and brutally takes J's new girlfriend Nicky (Laura Wheelwright) out of the picture. J becomes the linchpin of any case against the brothers, Leckie a seeming ally, but in truth J has no allies. There is no one he can trust. In a perhaps over-explicit moment, Leckie explains to J that he is exploitable as weak, because he is young. But J's stoical manner, hulking form, and swiftness on his feet belie that characterization. J's continual danger is the focus of 'Animal Kingdom's' high anxiety level. Cops, criminals, and lawyers all try to manipulate J. The Codys may not be gangland chieftains, but they do have legal and police allies who can undermine Leckie's efforts and make a mockery of his promise of safety for J.'Animal Kingdom' seethes with danger and has sporadic killings. But it's free of cathartic American Mafia-style shootouts or any sort of heavy violence. Deaths that occur have an almost documentary verisimilitude. There is more emphasis on unpredictability than on drama, and this increases the prevailing sense of dread.J, in his outsider's dilemma, dominates the scene, but so does Pope's increasingly psychopathic behavior. And when she steps in and takes a more active role in the action, Smurf also haunts us with her duplicitous smile. This is war, but whose side are we on? Undoubtedly ambitious, possibly by intention epic, 'Animal Kingdom' keeps its fresh feel through continuous surprises. The widescreen cinematography of Adam Arkapaw is always striking but never clichéd or scenic. Antony Partos' music is a little too portentous at times, but certainly maintains tension. The acting is uniformly strong. Frecheville as J is a continual presence. He is perhaps a bit too buttoned-up in manner, but he is also assured and physically memorable. A good feature is the way the other characters alternate in assuming dominance, first Edgerton as Baz, later Mendelsohn as Pope, finally the razer-sharp Pearce as the detective Leckie. Perhaps best of all is Jacki Weaver as the matriarch Smurf, whose insinuating, scary charm is unforgettable as she convincingly morphs from warm to despicable.'Animal Kingdom' debuted at Sundance and won its Grand Jury Prize, a step toward the recognition it will get as the best 2010 crime drama so far and one of the year's best films.

29,freemantle_uk,"A gritty, realistic crime and family film",8,19 March 2011,"Animal Kingdom is a very confidence, well made debut by David Michôd, a gritty, realistic film set in the Melbourne underworld.Joshua, AKA J (James Frecheville), is a 17-year-old man whom mum has just died of an heroin overdose. He turns to the only family he has, his grandmother, ""Smurf"" (Jacki Weaver) and his uncles, Craig (Sullivan Stapleton) and Darren (Luke Ford (surprisingly he got work after The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor)). The uncles run a crime family that have robbed banks and deals drugs, but there world starts to fall apart when the police start hounding them, shooting them and strength starts to fall apart. It gets worst when J's other uncle, ""Pope"" (Ben Mendelsohn) rejoins the family after hiding and the police after him. J is slowly brought into the family's criminal activities, but a senior police detective, Nathan Leckie (Guy Pearce) believes he could turn the young man after the shooting of two uniformed officers.What makes Animal Kingdom work is it gritty, down to Earth nature of the film. This is a film set in the unglamourous parts of Melbourne which is a really nice city. Crimes are quick and messy and that there was no glory in the criminal world. Emotions are real and you could easily believe in the events that happen in the film could happen in the real life. Michôd made a slow burning film where everything unfolds gradually; it was a film about characters, particularly J and about a dysfunctional family.The acting is great, it is really nature that you end up feeling like you are watching real people, not just actors. Frechville was brilliant as a kid in over his head and forced into a dark world with his conscious, family and the police pulling him in different directions. They was a really brilliant scene that looked real when he is crying a bathroom, with Michôd and Frechville not holding bad; J being unable to talk and snot and spit going all over the place. Weaver was nominated for an Oscar and there was a reason why she was nominated: her performance was great as a woman who is on the surface seemingly a nice woman who wants to help her grandson, but really a cunning and manipulative person who is very smooth operator. Think Peggy Mitchell who is less aggressive, more intelligent and played by a much better actress. Pearce is always good and his character could be read as two ways, one that he is simply a decent cop trying to get a young man out of a dirty world or a cop wanting to take down a family so badly that he would do anything to achieve it. Ford was actually good in this film (again, a surprise to anyone who saw Mummy 3) as one of the more sympathetic members of the family and Mendelsohn is a truly slimy piece of work. All the characters are well round, developed and believable. All of them have a realistic amount good and bad in them. It was an excellent job by Michôd as a writer and the actors.My one real criticism of the film is for a crime film I expected to see more crime being committed in the film. I know that Michôd was trying to make the film more realistic but it would be easy enough to show say a quick bank robbery with the family pointing gun, shouting, swearing and taking the money quickly or drug dealing or running prostitutes or brothels and show a wider network. But Animal Kingdom was still a very good film.4 out of 5.",Animal Kingdom
30,meeza,"Thy Kingdom Come, so brilliantly done!",10,20 February 2011,"""Animal Kingdom"" is a documentary that tells the tale of the creation of the infamous Disney Park! Not! Actually, the ""Animal Kingdom"" I am referring to has a far more different theme than the jolly theme park. ""Animal Kingdom"" is a superior Australian movie about a 17-year-old high school teen named Joshua ""J"" Cody who suddenly gets captured into a crime-ridden animalistic family filled with bank robbers, drug dealers, and murderers; these predators just happen to be his ferocious uncles and his matriarch, manipulative grandma. Joshua mother's fatal drug overdose results in his moving in with the Killer Cody herd. Writer-Director David Michod's masterpiece (yes, I said the ""M"" word) is undoubtedly one of the best family crime dramas that I have ever witnessed. Michod does not exploit the movie as a bang-bang shoot-them-up mindless tale, but instead he brilliantly centers the film around J's subjective experiences on being entrapped in this futile crime world which he did not choose to be a part of. Furthermore, Michod provides an authentic look at the mentality of a crime-ridden family which have deep-ridden fears that are masked with their avenging, scheming actions. Hey mates, I think David Michod is the real deal, this is his first film so I can't wait for more cinematic kingdoms to come from young David. The cast of ""Animal Kingdom"" is divine! James Frecheville's restrained ""WTF is going on around me"" performance as J was a stellar freshman effort. ""The Men From Uncle"", in other words the Cody Crime Brothers, were an eclectic and intimidating trio portrayed astoundingly by their Aussie actors. Ben Mendelsohn was profoundly menacing as Pope Cody, the uncle whose gaze and gestures were perfected by Mendelsohn in detailing the ruthlessness of his character. Sullivan Stapleton's fury performance as the ""Sonny Corleone-like"" Craig Cody staples Sullivan as an Aussie actor on the rise. The younger but more fragile & insecure Cody name Darren was played with exact aptitude by Luke Ford. But the stellar supporting cast ensemble of ""Animal Kingdom"" was not just about the Uncles. Joel Edgerton shined as Barry Brown, the Cody family confidante who happens to be the cerebral architect of the Cody armed robbery crew. And the veteran Aussie acclaimed actor Guy Pearce once again pierced away on his diversified acting skills with another grand effort in his work as the ""J-guide to the good side"" Detective Leckie. But it was Jacki Weaver's virtuoso performance as the grandma that I was hoping would get run over by a reindeer or at least a kangaroo, was the one that had the most thespian bite of them all. Weaver's Oscar-nominated performance as the conniving Smurf Cody is what acting dreams are made of! It will be an unjustified supertramp I mean supertrap if this DreamWeaver is not awarded the Best Supporting Actress Academy Award! There is not one mundane or insignificant scene in ""Animal Kingdom"", it is as luring as it is unpredictable, just like the animal kingdom itself.

I just wanted to see what she has done that denied nominations for Diane Wiest for ""Rabbit Hole"" or Mila Kunis for ""Black Swan,"" both of whom for me were undeservingly snubbed.The main story of ""Animal Kingdom"" is about 17 year old Josh (James Frecheville) whose mom dies in front of him from a drug overdose while they were watching TV. Grandma Janine (Weaver) gets Josh under her wing and thrusts him into the crazy criminal lives of her three boys Pope, Craig and Darren. I felt the set-up was too slow, and the film only comes to its own in the last thirty minutes or so.The eldest son Pope (Ben Mendelsohn) was by far the craziest and most violent, and had the scariest presence on screen. Perhaps in too much contrast was Frecheville's portrayal of Josh in a blank-faced, almost autistic, manner. Jackie Weaver plays the matriarch who condones her sons' criminal activities. She only shows her true evil towards the final stretch. It is not anything new, as we have seen similar ""terror moms"" in films before. Her face looked disturbingly a lot like Manny Pacquiao's mother.After watching this very long, excruciatingly plodding and occasionally violent film about a demented manic family of cold-blooded killers, I am not that impressed with the Oscar-nominated performance of Jackie Weaver, and with the film as a whole.",Animal Kingdom
33,valleyjohn,Very Good movie spoilt slightly by a confusing conclusion.,8,4 April 2011,"Animal Kingdom is one of the best movies to come out of Australia for a very long time. Nominated for an Oscar ( best supporting Actress ) it tells the story of a dysfunctional family who are big in the Melbourne Underworld . A family witch is subtly run the mother played by Jacki Weaver although you wouldn't think it a first glance. The oldest brother ""Pope"" is the real psycho though , he is the unstable one who you cant help but detest . Brilliantly played by Ben Mendelsohn .I loved the way the tension is built up in the movie . The way the police , lead by Leckie , played by Guy Pearce , try to convince the nephew to snitch on the brothers. Despite really enjoying this film it does have it's flaws, I don't think the actor who plays Joshua is very convincing . His acting is far too dead pan.I was also left confused by what happened near the end. The whole deal that was worked out with the court case is still puzzling to me. I would have given this a 9 or 10 if it wasn't for the confusing conclusion but i still really likes Animal Kingdom. It's all about Survival.Recommended.",Animal Kingdom

36,RainDogJr,"It reminded me of ""The Wire"" and ""The Departed"" – all with Australian accents and superb performances",10,22 August 2012,"Thanks to ANIMAL KINGDOM I recalled two of the very best works of the last years about crime – the series THE WIRE and the film by Martin Scorsese THE DEPARTED. I would say that ANIMAL KINGDOM is something like that: THE WIRE meets THE DEPARTED (all with sort-of British accents, as the film is set in Melbourne, Australia). However, while those pieces of work are mainly about cops, this ain't. It's about a crime family (oh boy, maybe with this you're thinking in THE SOPRANOS, but here's my piece of confession: while I own the first season on Blu-Ray, I have yet to see a full episode from that series!) and, especially, about a young man trapped in a world he doesn't quite belong in. Yeah, I know this doesn't sound like something we haven't seen before, but I meant the ""Wire"" and ""Departed"" comment as a REAL compliment; in other words: this is simply the best film I've recently seen and a piece any fan of crime films will truly appreciate. ANIMAL KINGDOM goes for the take on crime that the Italian writer Roberto Saviano (of GOMORRA fame) would think is appropriate for our times - Saviano once said that something like Tarantino's KILL BILL is a great film but at the same time something that can be seen as a glorification of violence (pretty much a source of inspiration for the real gangsters). Speaking of Tarantino, he actually picked ANIMAL KINGDOM for his always-bizarre best-of-the-year list (that's how I first heard of it), giving it the third place, only behind TOY STORY 3 and THE SOCIAL NETWORK. Anyway, since the very beginning the narrator (the mentioned young man – greatly played by James Frecheville) comes with a sort of ""crime doesn't pay"" commentary. This shows the fall and fears of a crime family – it's like a direct feud between the family and the police and rather than see them doing their criminal work we get, for instance, a scene with one of them (played by Sullivan Stapleton – the whole cast is simply superb) all nervous while doing something as ordinary as buying gasoline for his vehicle. To finish I will write a bit about why I thought in ""Wire"" and ""Departed"". It all deals with all the ""collateral damage"" that crime cause, the frustration that a detective can get thanks to his work (and to trials too) and themes like corruption and family honor – if you know the character Brianna Barksdale from ""Wire"" you know what it means if I say that here we have a very similar character in the mother of the family Janine Cody (played by Jacki Weaver – an Oscar-nominated performance, by the way); it means we have a woman cold enough for the crime world. And hell, to speak more specifically about ""Departed"" I would have to write the biggest spoiler possible –so I will just say that ANIMAL KINGDOM delivers some satisfying material as well. Great stuff! *Watched it on 19 August, 2012",Animal Kingdom

But they're not strong anymore...and they're certainly not able to protect you.""When 17 year-old Joshua's mother dies, he has no other choice but to turn to the family that he hasn't had much contact with for a while. The family that his mother tried to protect him from, because of their robbery and drug activities. His family welcomes him in, but their escalating problems with a particularly dangerous police unit and the volatile ruthlessness of some of the family members, will ultimately put him in a position of uncertain loyalty and certain danger. Animal Kingdom is solid in every way. It has no real flaws, and nothing readily comes to mind to criticize. It's a crime drama with the emphasis on the drama (this is not an action movie by any means), and if you like that genre, it's almost a given that this movie will be well worth your time. The story is riveting, the acting never falters, the characters are compelling and have depth, and it's just an all-around impressive debut for Australian director David Michod.

38,Chase_Witherspoon,Like 'Neighbours' on Crack,3,4 December 2010,"Tedious look at the Walsh street murders of two policeman, lured to a vandalised car in a quiet street then gunned down in cold blood as retribution in an ongoing crime investigation against a family of career criminals. Joel Edgerton plays one of the brothers contemplating a future in the stock market as a means of escaping the violent and in his view, unsustainable underworld life that has put both his life and that of his family at risk, while former ""Henderson Kid"" Mendelsohn continues his dark ride following ""Love My Way"" as the volatile and unbalanced brother Pope.There's myriad doco's shown on Australian TV that dissect the events depicted in this film, and each of them would be more entertaining and coherent than this picture. Heavy emphasis on symbolic gestures, aimless analogised dialogue and incessant slow motion sequences overlayed by an Air Supply soundtrack equal a confusing and tawdry account of events that could've and should've made for more entertaining viewing. Pearce seems quite realistic as the principal detective, but the kudos that flows to Jacki Weaver (who looks like a demented feminine-Jack Nicholson) for her ""Ma Baker"" like portrayal isn't (in my opinion) warranted. There's nothing especially original about her characterisation, nor particularly shocking about the matriarchal influence on her dysfunctional progeny.Limited location work and apparent anachronisms in the historical context could be forgiven if it weren't for the constant irritation of not knowing what's going on - the picture seems to assume that you know the events in such intimate detail that you'll catch-on to the erratic narrative, but that wasn't my experience. Atmospheric at times, the scene in which Pope interrogates Josh's (his nephew) girlfriend is pretty disturbing but the highlights are mostly lost amid the confusion. The material and components have potential but the execution is ultimately very disappointing.",Animal Kingdom

41,Troy_Campbell,A triumph of Australian cinema.,10,10 June 2010,"I will be honest, I have always found it hard to get excited about seeing an Aussie movie. I'm of the general opinion that the Oz film industry is normally too wrapped up in being 'true blue' that they forget to make films with a universal theme and subsequently building an output that strays very little. Well hasn't 2010 proved me wrong. First there was the breath of fresh air that was Bran Nue Dae followed by the memorable American-set debut by Sydney director Andrew Lancaster, Accidents Happen, and the moving WWI drama Beneath Hill 60. Then, like the final dose of a patriotic inoculation to my anti-Oz entertainment views of old, comes first-timer David Michod's Sundance winning Animal Kingdom, gaining my first five-star rating for the year.With nary a flaw to be found, this crime-drama unfolds at a terrifically slow-burning yet somehow exhilarating pace. The intricately detailed tale has been crafted with such care and dedication that every single frame seems to be oozing with importance, whilst the amazing soundtrack significantly adds to the immersive atmosphere. Drawing you in from the very first scene and never letting you go, you can't help but think about what happens long after the final credits roll. The ambitious movie-making and successful result is even more remarkable when you consider that Michod never resorts to gratuitousness (with violence or sex) or over-the-top, colourful personalities – fallback devices for many modern 'gangster' pictures – instead allowing his immaculately constructed story and deeply invested characters, all of whom share a layered relationship with one another, to sweep us away.Jacki Weaver has received numerous critical plaudits for her unnerving performance as Grandma Smurf – a resourceful, persevering women who'll stop at nothing to protect her boys – and deservedly so; the powerful handle she has on her sons and her willingness to embrace the criminal environment is deeply disturbing and chilling. Also tremendous, and for me the acting highlight of the picture, is Mendelsohn. An eerily quiet felon that can explode into unhinged and desperate violence at any moment, the monstrous Pope commands every bit of our attention. Witnessing his calm exterior when being arrested by the cops for a heinous crime – either because he assumes he'll go free or because going to prison just doesn't faze him – is extraordinary. Elsewhere youngsters Frecheville and Ford do a commendable job holding their own against such an experienced cast; Stapleton is fascinating as the drug-fuelled middle sibling; adding class and impact as always is international star Pearce whilst the immensely talented Edgerton presents a likable and charismatic alternative as Cody family friend Barry.A triumph of Australian cinema, this could very well be one of our nation's greatest.5 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)",Animal Kingdom
42,oneguyrambling,"Like 'The Town', only more plausible. And better.",8,8 April 2011,"At the start of almost every rental DVD in Australia is a 1 minute anti-film piracy ad that goes along the lines of: ""You wouldn't steal a car"" ""You wouldn't steal a handbag"" ""Then why steal a movie?"" It then continues to remind us downloading films is stealing and hurts the local industry. In recent years I might have said ""yeah, what industry?"", if we're honest there have been precious few decent Aussie films released.Thinking the local industry must have made a few decent films in the last couple of years I trooped off down to the video shop on a mission to find some local produce.Glad I did.The Animal Kingdom DVD actually does start with the ""you wouldn't steal"" ad then introduces you to a family who absolutely would – and worse.::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: When Josh's Mum ODs in the lounge room he does two things: calls the ambulance and finishes watching 'Deal or no Deal'.When she doesn't pull through he finds himself with nowhere to go and moves into the home of his Aunt and cousins: the Cody's. It is here Josh – or J as he is known – sees a side of life that he was previously shielded from.The parallels between this film and The Town are a little unavoidable, both focus on small groups of people for which crime is a way of life, but where The Town showed all the heists and robberies in their full glory and added some convenient plot twists and developments, Animal Kingdom plays it straight as a die and doesn't even pretend to include any glamorous aspects.Although we hear first hand that Josh's cousins have been particularly naughty boys we meet Craig, Darren, Andrew and family friend Barry at a time when they are lying especially low. Recent events have seen them targeted by the local police, and even with direct contacts with certain dirty cops it is evident that they aren't bribing or sneaking their way out of the spotlight at the moment. In fact Andrew or ""Pope"" (Ben Mendleson) doesn't pop his head out from hiding until a third of the way through the movie.Craig makes a healthy living by selling – and using – drugs, Barry is Pope's best mate, he has decided that perhaps this is all a little too much and he might go straight, and Darren seems to be the black sheep in the family, but begrudgingly involves himself as family is family.The head of the family is undisputably Janine ""Smurf"" Cody (Jackie Weaver) who greets all family members with a smile, a kind word and an unfortunate lingering mouth to mouth kiss. Constantly cheerful and positive, Janine holds the family together through tough times and will obviously do anything for her kids After another sudden death in the family everyone handles the news in different ways, with Janine making sure they all keep a level head and consider their responses before acting.A random act of brutal revenge brings with it immediate scrutiny and attention.Into all this is J and his school-aged girlfriend Nicole, neither want any part of the shenanigans but both become unwitting pawns in all that transpires.The figurehead of the police task force is Leckie (Guy Pearce), he is level headed and seems fair, but is nonetheless determined to nab the boys. He uses J as a lever, knowing that he is perhaps the most vulnerable and easy to manipulate. Only J wants nothing to do with anything and seems to go further into his introverted shell, giving nothing away and expressing little emotion.As things continue to heat up Pope exudes menace as he is backed further into a corner, Mendleson perhaps shows Jeremy Renner just how scary a real loose cannon can be by playing Pope as a purposeful man with precious few qualms and the capacity to do anything he deems necessary. At one point he is reminded that perhaps he might consider going back on his ""pills"", it doesn't appear that he does so.The other standout remains Janine, her family first attitude creates extreme circumstances and brings tough decisions that she apparently makes as she absentmindedly dunks a tea bag whilst turmoil swirls around her. It isn't always sunny in Janine-Land.Not being intimately involved in even mildly organised crime I am in no position to judge, but I would venture that Animal Kingdom paints a far more realistic picture of the lives of those in this situation than The Town. That isn't what makes this film superior though, it is cold, immediate and at times a suddenly violent picture of how people with no scruples react when given no real alternative.An excellent Australian film. No, make that an excellent film.Final Rating – 8 / 10. Brilliant performances and a driving plot, Animal Kingdom deserves an audience.",Animal Kingdom
43,antoniotierno,authentic story with genuine characters,8,15 November 2010,"Animal Kingdom's a gripping crime-drama, showing the best work Australian filmmaking industry has ever offered (in my view). The director takes a fresh approach, choosing to tell the ""who"" about a crime story, rather than the ""what"" or the ""why"". Everything is focused on dysfunctional family with brothers all varying in their faithfulness to a life of crime and all giving their contribution to a rising tension between themselves. Most of the characters (aside from Guy Pearce) are newbies but prove believable and convincing. The pace is relaxed, with the storyline growing tighter and tighter, reaching very high tension levels. I'd say this is the Aussie response to Martin Scorsese's storytelling, in fact this kind of references in ""Animal Kingdom"" isn't that hard hard to find – moments of high drama and visual poetry are are evident. On the whole this is a cracking story with excellent characters, an engrossing tale of a family's fall, with hints of incestuous love. The unusual (for a crime story) Australia location makes even more original a story genuinely lived in and real at the same time (not to mention James Frenchville's extraordinary performance).",Animal Kingdom
44,Philby-3,Caught up in their own villainy,8,10 July 2010,"Australian TV viewers seem to have a big appetite for semi-fictional gangster stories Underbelly 1,2 & 3 for example, but this grim story lacks the contrived glamour of its TV counterparts. From the first voice-over it is clear this is going to be a cautionary tale (""they all get caught in the end""). ""Loosely"" based on the Walsh St, Melbourne, police murders case of 1988, the focus is on Josh (James Frecheville), a younger member of a family of career criminals specializing in armed robbery who as the movie opens has not yet turned to a life of crime. After his mother dies from a heroin overdose he his taken in by his grandmother Cody (Jackie Weaver) who presides over a household of bank robbers and drug dealers. Things hot up after corrupt police execute on of their associates in a shopping centre car park and the gang retaliates by killing at random a couple of patrolling police the next day.Enter Guy Pearce (with silly moustache) in the unlikely role of an honest cop, anxious to prevent Josh going the way of his uncles Pope (a psychopathic Ben Mendelsohn), Craig (a drug-addled Sullivan Stapleton) and Darren (Luke Ford), a general purpose gangster who just does what he is told.This is a finely told but in the end a rather depressing tale. Even so I enjoyed Jackie Weaver's tough evil old granny and Ben Mendelsohn's tough nasty criminal. For these people even family members are expendable – you can see why Josh's druggie mother was anxious to keep him away from the rest of the family. The corrupt police are too close to home to be amusing, I am afraid, but their banality is well displayed.The dynamics of the Cody household reminded me of another grim but well-realised crime story of a family of killers ""The Boys"". Some characters would, given other circumstances would not behave so badly but for the presence of one or two really bad guys. Here, Mum loves then warts and all, a strange commentary on the noble ideal of unconditional love. The main performances are very solid but Ben Mendelsohn and Jackie Weaver are quite outstanding. The gloomy settings heighten the atmosphere of a group of people caught up by their villainy. Like the man said, a cautionary tale.",Animal Kingdom
45,sharky_55,"And you've done some bad things sweetie, haven't you?",9,15 September 2016,"It begins with the dulcet tones of Andrew O'Keefe's afternoon Deal or No Deal and a mother's heroin overdose. Joshua 'J' Cody sits blinking, almost unaware as the paramedics take her away. We're not sure if he is reacting to the death or is his gaze is focused on the television. Some criticism has been leveraged towards James Frecheville's performance as blank and unaffected by the chaos around him, and I suppose that there may be some truth in that. But to really understand this character you need to have met him. I have met a few Js in my time; they flit around the school system without so much as a word, and you could very well blow their mother's head off next to them and have the stony face not move an inch. They are barely of age and yet already covered by layers of learned masculinity that prevents any overt emotional reaction (and when he finally cries, it is with full-bodied shudders and snot). The brief, morose voice-over confirms as much - the Cody way of life is not so much different from what he has faced growing up his whole life. In David Michod's Animal Kingdom he is not simply thrust into the world of crime like many of these stories tend to do. He finds the Codys in a period of transition, where people are trying to change and leave for a better life. Their reasoning is that they can no longer live of life of constant surveillance and hiding, that at some point the certain thrills and riches of the criminal lifestyle cannot make up for the vice grip on their freedom and peace of mind. Baz has a wife and kid, and 20k that has become 60 in the stock market - future prospects. Edgerton has that Hollywood look about him, and seems more adjusted to civilian life than the Cody brothers could ever be. On some level, he has an assurance that they cannot afford. J also has this briefly, although he is haunted by the actions of his family throughout his stay at Nicole's. He drones out of the 'normal' family dinner, the shot rack focusing to the fate of the two policemen he helped lure to their deaths. It's a strange environment that Michod has created. It's not exactly the grim underbelly of the crime world, although Arkapaw has siphoned away its colour all the same. Australia does not have the same gun culture that these crime stories usually have, but the characters have no troubles with access there. A morbidly humorous scene shows this, with the masculine bravado of road-rage (not even that) being swiftly dispelled by the sight of a gun. The most intriguing aspect of the film, apart from the uniformly excellent performances, is the soundtrack. Partos knows exactly when to hold back here, so the viewer has time and head-space to be able to make their own judgements instead of being drowned out by the emotions of the score. He makes the silent cop killings chilling. He knows how to compress the Cody family with a cacophony of droning and buzzing as the investigators close in on them. And he knows how to magnify a moment in the slow motion, to show a monster sitting in his domain, or a house succumb to a SWAT raid like it us merely another Tuesday. These moments take on a dream-like quality, filtered through J's perspective until we are not sure what is really happening or who to trust. Would cops really shoot him in the vehicle? There is a brilliant moment when cops orchestrate a drug raid on the safe house that J stays in, also being guard by cops. The moral line has long been blurred that a police vest no longer holds any meaning. Ben Mendelsohn's Pope reminds me of (and looks a little like) Gary Oldman's Stansfield, both a quick trigger from exploding into a furious rage. But while Oldman was constantly on edge and trembling through his skin, Mendelsohn is dishevelled in a rat-like manner. You can see the weariness in his eyes and the lines in his face, and while his brothers panic, he simmers. Because he lacks this ability the character is more dangerous for it, and we feel threat from all corners, particularly as he leers over Nicole, and with a few simple words, bores into the innocent consciousness of J. The standout, however, is Jacki Weaver's Smurf, the mother hen of the nest. Unlike Pope, she never breaks character even once, reserving the same twisted smile and coo for her sons and cops alike. Her tendrils are wrapped tightly around her family, roping them in through motherly affection with incestuous tones. Weaver has a matter-of-fact delivery in her voice, never under any illusions about what she has brought into the world and how she will go about protecting them - even to the extent of throwing one cub to the vultures to shield the other two. And what Michod has commandeered in this ending is so magnificent that even she does not see it coming. After freely admitting J has been truly lost, she welcomes him back into her den with the belief that he has been neutered. But are we cheering for J as he achieves his vengeance? No, because in a small victory he has lost everything else, and that fresh-faced, solemn boy has replaced by a lion.",Animal Kingdom

If this was the real purpose of this film, it was a job well done, but I cannot believe this could be it.Finally, keep an eye on the grand mother. She may seem a friendly motherly type, always in the background, but she can set surprising things in motion. The rest of the time she overflows us with lots of kissing and hugging, plus the usual redundant ""How are you"" dialogs, always answered ""fine"" even if nothing is farther from the truth.",Animal Kingdom
47,KnightsofNi11,Smart and moving crime film,9,24 March 2011,"Crime films come in all shapes and sizes, calibres and scales, locations and people. There are too many crime films that just aren't intelligent enough to call themselves true crime films, a genre we associate masterpieces like The Godfather, Goodfellas, or Pulp Fiction with. Too many turn into exploitation films that focus more on action and explosions than a true crime story. Animal Kingdom breaks the current trend and offers something absolutely masterful. This is an incredibly smart crime film that comes from Australia. It follows the story of a family of criminals who are trying to get out of the business. It centers around J, a young man whose mother dies of a heroin overdose, causing him to go have to live with his grandmother and four uncles. He finds himself sucked into their crime business and finally when he's had enough he seeks the help of detective Nathan Leckie (Guy Pearce). The film is crafted very well and it displays a compelling array of characters whose story is woven together fascinatingly and it is vastly entertaining.This is the first feature film from director David Michôd, someone who I will now be watching closely, strongly anticipating his next film. He pieces this film together very well, with a strong script backed by tight artistic direction. He doesn't direct the film into an abstract art piece, rather it hones in on realism and simply just well orchestrated frames and well crafted set design and lighting. He directs his actors with a lot of precision and they all do a great job holding this film together and driving it very well, as this is mostly a character driven story. This film just displays all the techniques of great filmmaking, and it utilizes all the techniques to create something incredible and original.What really sets this film apart is its realistic and human script that displays a much more creative human dynamic between characters rather than something fake and Hollywood-ized that we see too much. The characters in this film are criminals, but they aren't cold heartless enigmas of pure evil with no contempt for their fellow man. Family ties is a major theme of the movie and it is evident through the undying love the family in this film shows for each other, despite their violent career and, for some of them, their unstable emotional state. The family consists of J, obviously. But then there is the grandmother, Janine, who only wants to be an important part of her sons lives, as well as care for them and love them unendingly. There is Barry, the oldest and most mature brother who seems to hold the family and their business together. Craig is the one with the toughest front who walks around the house without a shirt on, cursing and snorting cocaine, but he actually has a deep emotional side to him, as unexpected as that might be. Darren is the quiet one who seems to be a follower rather than a leader. And the most troubled of the brothers is Pope, the most violent and unstable character of the whole movie who gives the entire film it's sinister overtone. All these character coming together and displaying such human interactions makes the film more disturbing than any stereotypical tough guy gangster character.Animal Kingdom is just a fascinating film that you can connect with in unexpected and troubling ways. It is dark and foreboding, but incredibly compelling and moving as well. The characters are all different and interesting and their dialouge is excellent. The film doesn't force any emotional response down your throat, and it doesn't hold your hand throughout the story either. You have to figure a lot of things out on your own, without having them explicitly explained to you on screen. This film is subtle, strange, and gripping, making it an incredibly smart cinematic experience that you wont forget.",Animal Kingdom
48,cultfilmfan,Animal Kingdom,9,14 October 2010,"Animal Kingdom is an Australian film that focuses on a seventeen year old young man named Josh. Josh's mother has just died and not knowing who he should call he calls his grandmother Janine. Josh explains to Janine the situation and she goes to pick him up and lets him stay with her at her home. What we also learn is that Josh and Janine have not seen each other in years. Janine is Josh's mother's mother and they had a falling out, so because of that they have not seen each other for quite a long time. Usually around Janine's house are her sons and Josh's uncles. We soon see that they are involved in numerous criminal and other illegal behaviour and that the police are on to them. One officer by the name of Leckie, continually questions Josh, and in his own way tries to protect him from his family and as time goes on, Josh, starts to see what he means because whenever Josh, has been questioned his uncles are very uneasy around him and the fear and ultimately violent actions that take place will leave Josh with a tough decision, which is whether to turn his uncles in and betray the only family he has, or to lie to Leckie and continue to live in fear. Animal Kingdom works for several reasons. It is a very intense and disturbing film that is in it's own way is also a very creepy and scary film. The performances and the musical score really elaborate this and at times I was getting uncomfortable in my seat not knowing what would happen in this film and because of the brilliant performances and music the film made me squirm in my seat even more. The film has a gritty and earthy type of look and feel to it, which I found appropriate for the story telling and basically the setting and mood the filmmakers were trying to get across. The story is quite an involving one and as it moved on I started to care for Josh, and hoped that he would make it out of this terrible situation and that in one way, or another he would go on to bigger and better things. Also every time his uncles were on screen they struck a fear and uncomfortable feeling inside of me and basically real genuine fear of these characters. The film is a low budget film, but by using very good actors, music and story it elevates it to become a first grade picture that I think most people would like, if they would only give it a chance and go see it. This is an incredibly powerful and disturbing film and it will leave an impact on you because of how masterfully it was done with it's great cast, crew and story. One of the most suspenseful and powerful films of the year that deserves a look from others because behind all this lies a really good movie and one that should be seen.",Animal Kingdom

50,CountZero313,"revenge, and the consequences",9,27 July 2014,"A disaffected young man makes a fateful phone call when he discovers his mother dead on the living room sofa after an overdose.This compelling tale of the unraveling of a notorious crime family centers on Joshua, a nephew and apprentice brought into the fold after his mother's demise, despite her stated intentions to isolate and protect him from her mother and siblings. We soon realise why - the brothers are armed robbers, supported by their over-affectionate mother Janine (a creepily effective Jacki Weaver), currently lying low while the cops look for Pope, the leader of the group.Pope's menace is gradually built by keeping him off-screen for most of the opening. Ben Mendelsohn as Pope gives a performance that lives up to the billing, mixing calm deadliness with explosive rage. He kills by instinct and feels no remorse, the character who most embodies the film's title. When he turns on Joshua, this provides the main narrative line that reaches a shocking but merited conclusion.The camera stays close to the characters and the dialogue is fractured and in the vernacular. This makes it all the more gritty and real. James Frecheville as Joshua is our guide through this world, an unresponsive drone most of the time, till he is compelled to take charge by the threat to his own life and the inability of the authorities to protect him. One genre strand here is the worm that turned. Frecheville is stunning as the taciturn, immature young man who has to learn and grow up quickly in a hostile world.For a crime drama about a violent family the film admirably does not linger on the gun violence. One key turning point, the (alleged) murder of a family intimate by the cops, is rendered through a reaction shot with Pope. The revenge killing of policemen is shown in long shot through silhouettes. The drama avoids schlock violence to stay with the characters and their motivations, and is all the better for it.The cheap, tasteless interiors, scrubby front yards, daggy fashions, head-bumping masculinity and authentic Aussie accents reminded me of Snowtown, another film about violent men in anonymous Australian suburbs. Is this an emerging Aussie aesthetic? If so, I for one would like to see more.",Animal Kingdom
51,Likes_Ninjas90,Animal Kingdom is a solid crime film but it lacks the emotional pull to make it particularly memorable,7,23 June 2010,"When Joshua 'J' Cody (James Frecheville) finds his mother dead from a drug overdose he contacts his grandmother Janine (Jacki Weaver) for support. Janine is the matriarch for the crime family that J's mother tried to shield him from. The family is made up of Janine and her three sons Andrew (Ben Mendelsohn), Darren (Luke Ford) and Craig (Sullivan Stapleton), as well as a close family friend in Barry Brown (Joel Edgerton). They are all under stress given the trigger happy nature of the police force who are in a standoff against the underworld. J's entry into the family exposes him to the drug culture that the rest of the family is already accustomed to. When Barry is executed at point blank range by a police officer it sparks dangerous tensions between the Cody's and the police. A cop named Leckie (Guy Pearce) is quick to latch onto J to see if he will help them bring down the crime family because he knows the dangers that J and his girlfriend Nicky (Laura Wheelwright) are in.Animal Kingdom, directed by David Michôd, carries a sense of nostalgia for Australian cinema. It reminds the audience of Australia's ability to cinematically tell powerful and intimate stories of lower class thugs, with a high degree of realism and verisimilitude. Yet its tendency to cover overly familiar elements of the crime genre is also suggestive of the ongoing problems with script development in this country. One of the first mistakes that the screenplay makes is killing off one of the film's most interesting and engaging characters at the start of the film. With the discussion about giving up the life of crime and getting into business there is a suggestion that this will be a revisionist type of crime film. This promise is never fulfilled with the death of this character and as such the film rarely transcends the genre. It delivers us once more into the lives of drug addicts, lowlifes, straight and crooked cops and exposes us to sporadic but senseless violence. There are few characters who can win the sympathy of the audience here. J has been deliberately characterised as a monotone teenager, who is incapable of thinking for himself and the way that he is pulled in different directions by the opposite sides of the law is one of the most interesting ideas in the script. Yet its been overly written to the point where it just isn't credible. In the very first scene in the film J insists on watching television while the paramedics attend to his mum in the same room. Frecheville has presumably been directed to play this role in a specific way, showing very little emotion, but it also makes his character almost entirely inaccessible and the film becomes distancing. Significantly, there are also a glaring number of plot holes in the narrative too, specifically the omission of any forensic investigation for the crimes, suggesting a lack of research during the script writing process.For the various problems with the script, the direction of Michôd should still be commended for the grittiness and realism in which the film has been visualised. The locations of the film, like the interior of the Cody house, seem real and contribute significantly in one's belief of the family dynamics. The quite, intimate moments are contrasted with sporadic but graphic violence that is never glorified, unlike the television series Underbelly and its kinetic visual style. Even more impressive are the performances of the cast, who aside from Frecheville, are excellent. Joel Edgerton is missed throughout the film because he grounds his character with a believable amount of intelligence. Ben Mendelsohn is trippy as 'Pope' and his ability to combine a doped out image with his violent unpredictability makes him quite menacing. Jackie Weaver is also splendid as the slightly over-bearing grandmother, with a much nastier edge. Easily the most sympathetic character in the film is J's girlfriend and her parents are perfectly cast, even though they only have very minor roles. Why they would let their daughter's boyfriend, who has notorious relatives, stay in their house though is one of the many plot holes that has to be overlooked.Animal Kingdom is a solid crime film but it lacks the emotional pull to make it particularly memorable. This is mostly due to the lack of a particularly engaging protagonist. There are plenty of strong performances throughout this film, particularly Mendelsohn, but it does make the audience question where the film is meant to be heading when we are forced to side with someone who seems to be almost entirely incapable of redeeming themselves here. With a tighter script and less plot holes this could have been a much more successful film given the number of good performances and also the high degree of realism that has been employed to tell this story.",Animal Kingdom
52,Blue-Grotto,10th Anniversary!,8,6 June 2020,"There is a certain order to the natural world where the strong dominate the weak and every critter knows its place in the scheme of things. There is also luck, a shift in the wind, miscalculation or sudden storm that throw things off balance.In Animal Kingdom a family of criminals and black sheep alienates a teenager among them, Joshua, who is forced to decide where he fits in the order of the weak and strong. A lovely girlfriend, hulking and menacing male relatives, good and bad factions of cops and lawyers, and a manipulative, bewitching matriarch all lay claim to his affections. To rely on any of them, Joshua first must learn to rely on himself.1980s Melbourne is the setting of Animal Kingdom. The murder rate at the time was extremely high and in response the police became increasingly aggressive and careless. The result was a cycle of violence and revenge which Animal Kingdom portrays. The eerie, Cleopatra-like influence of the family matriarch over her male brood is one of the most interesting aspects of this raw and fascinating film. Ben Mendelsohn, Joel Edgerton and Guy Pearce provide convincing performances and reveal why they are rising stars.",Animal Kingdom

The cast is pitch perfect but standout is Jacki Weaver who's sexy and stylish grandmother role shutters the screen to pieces. Guy Pearce has shown us another reason why he's considered one of the most underused and ignored actors in the business. Breakthrough performer James Frecheville who plays 'J,' makes a big splash among a bigger, louder cast but shows no intimidation.

55,dfle3,Excellent crime family drama...gloomy...,9,27 July 2010,"As usual, I had to overcome my great inertia in seeing Australian films. And yet again I have been greatly rewarded (the more common flipside is great disappointment). Decided to see this film today...wasn't sure if I REALLY wanted to. Glad I did.Anyway, this movie seems to draw on a lot real-life events without being a fact based movie. The Walsh St. murders will be brought to mind by one scene in this movie. The matriarch of the family too will bring to mind a well known identity to Australians who live in the city where this is set...Melbourne, Australia.The plot concerns what happens to a lad - not yet 18 - who has his mother and sole parent die...he moves in with his grandmother, who happens to be the overly-affectionate mother of small time criminals who deal with corrupt police officers.Cast is uniformly excellent...James Frecheville as the orphan Joshua 'J' Cody is suitably expressionless throughout the movie. Jacki Weaver as his grandmother - Janine Cody - shows a lot of sides to her character. And Ben Mendelsohn as J's uncle - Andrew 'Pope' Cody - is creepily solicitous.If you find some scenes totally unbelievable, I'm pretty sure that they'd be the ones ripped from the headlines of years gone by! Police corruption has been denied in this state, but it was there. And the SOGgies get some screen time too...since I've read about some of this stuff, I knew what that phrase meant...""Sons of God""...a police division that got disbanded due to their corruption...that wasn't their official title though...self-imposed name. It actually stood for ""Special Operations Group"".The use of music is effective in this movie...apart from some good cheesy songs, it has minimalist synthesiser music to create an air of dread.Not sure if the final scene in this movie has its real life counterpart, but it did bring a strangely satisfying sense of ""closure"" to the proceedings.This film has been in our top 10 at the box office for a while now and has done respectably for an Australian movie.You should see it. A great Australian take on crime drama...that doesn't draw on Hollywood clichés or other niche genres...this is no Guy Ritchie or Quentin Tarantino movie. One of the reasons this movie may be doing so well here is, perhaps, the ""Underbelly"" effect. That is a hugely successful fact based crime drama series on commercial TV over here. I've given that series a miss...it seems pretty superficial and gratuitously titillating. Hopefully the ""Underbelly"" crowd appreciated this serious but affecting movie.",Animal Kingdom
56,diane-34,Wow,10,5 July 2010,"I have watched a fair number of films and Animal Kingdom will definitely occupy a place in my porous memory; the film was, at least to people like Diane and I who have no idea if the subject matter was close to true, extremely raw and real and not dressed up or prettied up for the audience. The people involved played their roles close to the bone; they played their roles in a common kind of way. Although they were criminals and as the film progresses easily capable of the most horrific crimes, they still showed ""a person next door"" fragility. I was struck by the commonality of the settings, the neighborhoods, the furnishings, the cars they drove. Forget everything you have ever seen about Hollywood crime shows with fancy cars and rich settings because this film is gritty.Animal Kingdom is truly film at its best; film that forces the viewer to see how crime really is, at least here in Australia. At the beginning of the film, one of the characters says something about criminality and how it always catches up with the person involved; there is no escaping the consequences. The film is a portrait of that statement and the viewer is brought along, many times grimacing, until the sequences are played out. Animal Kingdom is a brilliant film and every person acting in this film deserves the greatest plaudits that we can give them and the film as a whole.",Animal Kingdom
57,pfgpowell-1,Another solid and subtle film coming out of Australia. Catch it.,8,24 April 2015,"I don't know what it is about Australian cinema and filmmakers these past 15 years, but they are just getting better and better. OK, so we here in the Northern Hemisphere don't necessarily get to see the dross. Granted. But what we do see shows that there's talent galore down under. There are, of course, talented actors, writers, cinematographers and directors around the world, but at the moment Australia seems to have found its own voice, its own style which is not just unique, but interesting, accomplished and gripping.Unlike so much high-energy Hollywood dreck, Animal Kingdom relies on a good script, a gripping story, good acting, solid characterisation and great directing. There is no gratuitous flashiness to cover up bald patches. This particular film's style is minimalist, the camera hand-held (as far as I can see) throughout. But that doesn't lead to tricksy artiness.It allows the actors to act - it's what they do best after all - with none of them falling back onto the schtick they are always hired for - Bruce Willis being Bruce Willis, Tom Cruise being Tom Cruise, you get the picture. All I can say is if you get the chance to catch this, catch it. Oh, and keep making them, Australia.",Animal Kingdom
58,rooee,Kingdom of Hell,7,28 February 2011,"It's hard to believe this hugely assured crime drama is a debut feature. Writer-director David Michôd can now join Andrew Dominik and John Hillcoat at the spearhead of a muscular antipodean auteur movement.The plot concerns ""J"" (James Frecheville), who is forced to move in with his fearsome grandmother-cum-minor-crime-boss, Janine (Oscar-nominated Jacki Weaver) after his mother dies from an overdose. From J's reaction we gather that his relationship with his mother was far from perfect. But any sense that J will find a laudable father figure in one of Janine's three sons is quickly put to bed when J becomes embroiled in a small-scale war between the Cody family and the Melbourne cops. Representing the law, and an appealing second option for J, is Senior Officer Nathan Leckie, played by the ever-reliable Guy Pearce.The familiar elements are here - the conflicted youngster who must choose between family and morality, family and legality, family and real love - but depicted in unusual detail and with rare precision by all involved.Aesthetically, Animal Kingdom is bold and atmospheric, almost dream-like in its use of flowing sound and image, recalling early Michael Mann. Antony Partos's score - a blend of brooding orchestral and eerie ambient - lays across the film like a drenched mantle of doom. The violence is framed grandly, but isn't glorified.The script, by Michôd, is sharp as a shiv, skilfully balancing pure verbalisation (Leckie), vicious innuendo (Ben Mendelsohn's ""Pope""), and burning silence (J, fraying in an allegiance tug-of-war). Though Weaver and Mendelsohn have rightly won plaudits for their roles, Frecheville was the standout for me: an apparent blank slate; yet always there is the sense that he is in a state of vulnerable absorption, without ever tracing his actions back to their moral moorings. Heart-rending.This is a serious and subtly powerful drama, often moving and often disturbing, which, like Xavier Beauvois' Of Gods and Men, should really have had more impact on the Academy Awards.",Animal Kingdom

Their protocol is clearly a criminally dysfunctional operation. There are likable brothers of various degrees of maturity and common sense but they are still maternally bound and run on testosterone, and you know it's going to end badly. Jackie Weaver is absolutely creepy as the self serving Grandma and Ben Mendelsohn is even more out of touch as the desperately evil surviving brother. Our narrator is the youngest member thrown into the fray and is detached due to his Mom's years of drug abuse. In the wild do animal parents really eat their own?

60,bobbobwhite,Hated the ending,8,7 September 2010,"This mean and vicious Melbourne, Australia crime story was very realistic and well done overall with acting kudos going to the great Guy Pearce as the lead detective in pursuit of a very scary family of criminal psychopaths, and by Jacki Weaver, the lioness and leader of her vicious gang of sons that included a meek and nearly mute grandson who got caught up in their crimes and was coerced unwillingly in helping the ""boys'"" truly vicious and abjectly stupid(duh, they were criminals)criminal endeavers.I couldn't feel much for the pathetic grandson, as his almost mute, mopey and morose personality really put me off, along with his wimpy compliance with the crime acts his nutso uncles and equally sick and duplicitous grandmother wanted him to do. It made me always wonder why he didn't immediately hit the road instead, as anyone with half a brain would know it would all end badly. But, we are all dumb as a post at 17 years old, and he apparently needed whatever family he had after his mother OD'd, even though you would never know it by his dull presence. In earlier times I would call him a creep, but today anything goes, and in that horrendously sick family he was the only speck of sanity to be found.The police pursuit and Pearce's character's constant and caring attempts to get the weak grandson to understand what he was getting himself into were quality storytelling, but the story went soft at the end and the grandson once again disappointed me with his incomplete and poorly thought-out ""partial solution"" that left a lot of unfinished work that was really crucial for the betterment of society, and also meant that he would again be easily manipulated by the treacherous and uncaring mother lioness into more crime that you knew would end just as badly for him as it did for his uncles.

ANIMAL KINGDOM is a fine portrayal of what it's like for Joshua Cody, caught between the mini-mafia of his relatives and the corrupt local police. The film is also quite revealing of the inner workings of the criminal ""justice"" system. Driven more by theme and character than plot, ANIMAL KINGDOM has very realistic and believable character development and motivations, with a few prominent exceptions (e.g., would the cops, even if they were crooks themselves, really blow away a man they'd been tailing in public/broad daylight?)

Relative newcomer James Frecheville plays Josh who has been kept apart from his family until one day when he gets drawn into their criminal world, from here on in it's a tug of war between them and the police. Officer Leckie (Pearce) believes he can save the boy from his fate, the question is can he save him before it's too late?

64,Ryan_MYeah,I wanted to like it more than I did.,5,19 November 2010,"The film is centered around 17 year old Josh (Played as bored and passive by newcomer James Frecheville). After his mother dies, he's suddenly forced to live with his criminal relatives. This starts a wave of rising paranoia, cover ups, and murder within the family, which seems to pinpoint Josh as the core of the problem, as he is being interrogated by a detective (Played by Guy Pearce) who thinks he can help him.The story starts off with real potential, but as it goes on, all of that seems to vanish for some unexplainable reason. I'm obviously in some sort of minority here, but the story can't keep a firm focus on these events, even going at such a slow pace as it does. And James Frecheville really needed to try harder, as his character seems uninterested by all of these things happening, it's quite wooden to be honest. And this is nothing to say about the score by Antony Partos, which is often quite distracting, and simply uninteresting.The rest of the cast are honestly not that bad though. Guy Pearce, Joel Edgerton, Luke Ford, and Sullivan Stapleton give it their best shot, but it's not quite enough. It'd be easy for me to write the film off entirely if not for two things, such as Jacki Weaver's performance as the family matriarch. Her presence is often sweet, yet highly unnerving. And the other performance that saves this movie is Ben Mendelsohn's performance as one of Josh's uncles, Andrew.

Australian filmmaker David Michôd making his feature directorial debut from his own script finds moments of muted horror in these lives gone astray, starting right out of the gate. An excellent Aussie crime drama thoroughly deserving of its across-the- board rave reviews. Seventeen year-old Joshua Cody (James Frecheville) is suddenly on his own after his mother dies from an overdose and has no place to stay. He is taken in by his grandmother Smurf (Jacki Weaver). She is the matriarch of a notorious Melbourne crime family, further consisting of her four sons Andrew (Ben Mendelsohn) Craig (Sullivan Stapleton), Darren (Luke Ford), and Baz (Joel Edgerton), all of whom are armed criminals. Melbourne's Armed Robbery Squad is after specifically Pope, who is hiding out. When Baz is murdered, the family's voice of reason is gone, and the unstable Pope takes the lead in the family's hierarchy. Nathan Leckie (Guy Pearce) is a police detective who has found out who Joshua is and what he knows. He tries to convince the teenager to help him put the family behind bars. Joshua isn't certain about his loyalties to these outlaws, who he hardly knows, which are also his blood. Michôd's film combines the shock of sudden plot turns with a slow burn, leading to the inevitable horror that plays up the emotional cost of violence. Utterly thrilling, ""Animal Kingdom"" exudes stunning depth and complexity. Packed with characters so chillingly, casually evil that it will linger with you for days.

70,dharmendrasingh,Films with 'Kingdom' in their title seldom deliver,4,10 March 2011,"Notwithstanding its infamous past, I've always had Australia down as a sin-free place. But the Australia in David Michôd's 'Animal Kingdom' may instead have you opting for New Zealand this summer. After his mother overdoses on heroin, Joshua (James Frecheville), or J as he's known, reluctantly moves in with his grandmother and the rest of her crime family. She may be diminutive and mellifluous, but she has the ruthlessness of a hyena. Her boys are her minions and she is their Ma Barker. The family have sustained a drug racket for a long time (the drug trade is so sanitised here that it seems a legitimate trade), however, a new police unit threatens their survival. Their chances might have been better were not for Pope (Ben Mendelsohn) showing up. He's the psycho of the clan, and is around to exact revenge for one of his slain brothers, shot by a police officer for no reason. As the only non-criminal, J is regarded a liability and becomes the gang's fall guy. These are dangerous people, yet we don't see (many) violent outbursts. Their minatory gestures are enough proof of their power. Jacki Weaver, as the ringleader, is perhaps the most evil character. She's the sort who raises criminals and still refers to them as 'angels'.The only interesting character (though the interest is only passable) is Guy Pearce's copper. He puts pressure on J to inform against his crime family – they want him dead after all. Pearce's survival of the fittest analogy, intended to frighten J, seems too intellectual for him to comprehend, which shows in his confused gaze. He doesn't deliver and the whole film suffers because of it. His role is the fulcrum, but he makes the mistake of remaining balanced. A person in his position would be an emotional wreck, but he seems to take everything in his stride – as I did with the film.I've noticed that films with 'Kingdom' in their title seldom deliver.

The sinister mob of drug dealers, murderers and other types of criminals, is being ravaged bit by the force of the law, and Josh – no longer a simple bystander – is beginning to go down with them all. However an easy escape is far from possible, as the bandits are all members of his family, making things horrifyingly convoluted, and it seems that no one can untangle Josh from the monstrous hold of his bloodthirsty relatives.Undoubtedly this truly morbid provides some splendidly horrific groundwork for a film, all of which is full of potential, and none of this is wasted. It is intelligently realised that the story, being of harsh realities, is spectacular, thrilling, affecting and cinematic enough to go without flashy embellishments – music, special effects, stylisation etcetera – and works wonders with only two simple things: a masterfully-written screenplay and several fine performances from a phenomenal cast. The script is the work of writer-director David Michôd. As for the acting, this aspect is mostly a credit to a Jacki Weaver and Ben Mendelsohn; proving quickly to be the undisputed standouts, they play the two foulest of Josh's relationships, and are joined on the family & friends ensemble by Luke Ford, Sullivan Stapleton and Joel Edgerton, who turn in commendable efforts.The auxiliary players – among them Laura Wheelwright and Guy Pearce – are, wisely, treated with just as much humanity as Weaver and Mendelsohn, giving things a heightened sense of reality: these others form the contrasting shell of normality that surrounds the festering lump of agony placed in the spotlight, flourishing such a promising chance of salvation that we will Josh to seek relief by it. However, eventually it becomes clear and undeniable that he cannot be rescued, in much the same way that Frecheville's perfectly adequate yet most unremarkable performance cannot be redeemed. The young actor is very fortunate that with the masterful craftsmanship of his co-stars and executives to we are not calling upon him for any incredible feats of film-making.",Animal Kingdom
72,rdukeesq,highly original take on the crime thriller,8,9 August 2011,"So I watched Australia's 2010 winner for best picture ""Animal Kingdom"". So was it good, I say throw another shrimp on the barbie and enjoy this great flick. Now is this film perfect, no it could be a bit slow at times for a crime saga, and seems to have gaps in the plot where the audience is supposed to catch on to what happened at some point in the past (which is fine I could keep up). That being said this movie is highly original, well acted, well written, and well directed. I can see why it got so much acclaim in it's native Australia. I particularly liked how it started off with the potential of developing into a crime drama where the main character, a 16 year old named J, is brought in to learn the family trade and nothing else, but skewed off that plot point quickly. I expected to see robberies because this is what the family does. However, what we get instead is the aftermath of one of their scores we don't even really learn about it other than to see some money being counted out early on in this film. Instead J is thrust into this world after his mom dies and we go through a range of emotions and action as the family takes on the police hell bent on taking them down one way or another. So with that being said, this movie on my own IMDb would normally be a 7, but when the ending comes it comes at you hard and fast, and I did see it coming, but only moments before it happened. So if you take everything into consideration this goes down as one of the most original crime thrillers of all time. ""Animal Kingdom"" is not necessarily the best, but definitely one of the most original and no matter what a must see for both intellectuals and crime film fans. if you like concise reviews of interesting films please read my other reviews at http://raouldukeatthemovies.blogspot.com/",Animal Kingdom
73,evan_harvey,Dull,1,16 October 2010,"I heard good things about this film, but alas, after watching it, I realised that, like so many other Australian films, it's just dull. Slow, boring, well-filmed and dull. If this is the ""animal kingdom"", then the animals are either dying of disease or stupidity.The dialogue is average; the story is okay, but very slow, and nothing really lifts the pace in any way. It should have been a stronger, faster film, but instead it traded that for an half-assed character-driven film that limps along. The cinematography is okay in itself, but there's nothing that makes it an iconic Melbourne-set film, which it should have been.The lead character, 'J' appears to be slightly retarded. The Cody brothers are amateurs, and it's surprising that they lasted as long as they did. We're told that the Cody brothers are drug dealers, and bank robbers, but we never see any of that.It won an award at Sundance, which I think reflects the quality of other films on offer. It's great that an Australian film has done reasonably well, but unfortunately it represents the entrenched Australian film industry mindset - slow, dull, and without appeal. A 45 minute film stretched to 90 minutes.",Animal Kingdom
74,toll-8,This film should be protected by the strong!!,9,9 September 2012,"I had been told about this film several months ago, and had been told by this anonymous person that it was their favourite film of its year. With Inception and The Social Network being released the same year I was rather dubious as to this person's suggestion. I have to say however after giving this film a watch I can completely understand where they are coming from because this film is absolutely brilliant, and I am annoyed at myself that it has taken me this long to see it.Set in Australia revolving around a crime family, Animal Kingdom follows the story of J (Frecheville), who is taken in by his Grandmother after the death of his Mother. Whilst in the company of his Grandmother and Uncles he realises that they are involved in some of the hefty crimes that have been taking place in the community. One of his Uncles; Pope, (Ben Mendelsohn who is absolutely fantastic) is currently in hiding and the police are after him over a recent bank robbery. However instead of finding him via looking the police decide to kill his partner in order to entice him out. The only problem with this though is Pope then decides to retaliate and he and his brothers kill two policemen in an act of vengeance. After being broadcast all over the news, the police bring in Detective Senior Sergeant Leckie (Guy Pearce) to bring the Cody family in, and their first port of call is J. Once J has been interviewed though his own family turn against him in the belief that he has turned them in. J then finds himself on the run from the evil Pope and the cops, and is unsure of which one to trust.The film is not like anything we haven't seen before but it is the way it is told that stands this film above the rest. For starters the setting being Australia really adds to the tension, especially with it being set during the time when cops were killing criminals and finding excuses afterwards. It is also interesting to side with the 'bad' guys, but also showing how the police can also be just as bad in their own way. We are actually pulled in to care for this family despite how evil they are. J especially is someone we side with despite the fact that his character has no real qualities that we can cling to. We just go with his situation and you ask yourself what you would do in his position. The film also delivers us a chilling ending, which is certainly crucial to the outcome, and a highly powerful scene in the middle that had me frightened for a good ten minutes. The dark, moody tone of the cinematography really adds to this.The acting in the film is very good. Mendelsohn is on top, top form and it is good to see him being rewarded with roles in films such as The Dark Knight Rises as he is a top class actor. Jacki Weaver is also really freaky as the Mother of these evil brothers. She plays the part full of tension and even hints at a sign of incestual nature between her and her children. It is the performance and the way she kisses them that highlights this. She also comes out of her shell later on in the film and she grows even more into the role. These two are the stand outs of the cast but Edgerton, Pearce, and Sullivan Stapleton are also good. Frecheville has come into a lot of criticism of his performance by other reviews; however I feel they are slightly harsh. For a newcomer his performance is good and I believe it is his character that lacks personality as opposed to the actor.Another top area of the film is the music. Even the music on the DVD menu had me gripped by what I was about to watch. Every time a piece of music kicked in I was instantly drawn into the scene. Even an image of three lions on a picture, with the central one standing proud, is racked full of tension due to the brilliant score.There isn't much I can point out as wrong with this film. Maybe it is a shame that a top actor disappears quite early on, but this also adds more to it. I have to say this film has affected me. I can't get the creepy music out my head, or some of the powerful scenes that go with it. I haven't seen any other Australian films that have moved me quite like this, but from now on I will not be put off by them. David Michod has managed to produce a script full of believability and character building, and has also directed and drawn some excellently creepy performances by some actors who are possibly unheard of on the Hollywood circuit. Thanks to Animal Kingdom however, I think Michod has highlighted his own name, and his casts names, on the Hollywood 'to get' list.4.5 / 5For more reviews: www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com",Animal Kingdom

This film is one of my favorites, it's unique, ingenious, special... dare I say perfect?This is sort of similar to Dogville in that it evaluates the darkness in society, the vindication the evil receive, and the selfishness of others. But the main difference is that this film is dark from beginning to end, it has almost no cheerful moment.James Frecheville is a brilliant actor, I felt sympathetic towards his character, yet apathetic when he remained apathetic, an instant connection that drew me into the plot. Ben Mendelsohn does great as the dark figure in the film, the person you despise. Guy Pearce... well he's Guy Pearce!Jacki Weaver and the other actors all do well, I didn't see a single flaw in this film. Although some might say James Frencheville was a bit withdrawn and apathetic, I believe any other reaction would've led to a melodramatic film that would've been closer to a soap opera than an Oscar-worthy film. He remains detached for some incidents that would otherwise cause a reaction to others, but when he does react, you can't help but feel sympathetic. It also allows the viewer to understand his actions/decisions every time.If you are looking for a film you will enjoy from the first second to the last, look no further, but be warned that the brilliance of this film also leads to a depressing tone throughout it.I adore Animal Kingdom (and how aptly named... it has everything to do with the film and Guy Pearce does well introducing), this film is majestic... riveting... magnificent. 10 Stars and then some",Animal Kingdom
76,gilligan-11,Blood is probably not any thicker than water,7,20 March 2011,"""Animal Kingdom"" is a dark and brutal Australian crime thriller. Its moral center (who may or may not be de-centered by the end of the film) is J, a 17 year-old boy, whom we see in the opening frame of the film, sitting next to his mother, recently dead from a heroin overdose. With nowhere else to turn, J calls his grandmother, played with saccharine evil by the Oscar-nominated Jacki Weaver. J moves in with his grandmother and his four uncles, each one a criminal of varying degrees. As the uncles engage in various crimes, bodies begin piling up, and J finds himself in a quandary— remain loyal to his amoral and ruthless family or trust in the promise of safety offered by a sympathetic police detective, played by Guy Pearce? For a violent crime thriller, this film moves rather slowly and methodically, and the acts of violence punctuate the contemplative pace of the film like explosive exclamation points.",Animal Kingdom

I found this really frustrating because the story, the acting, the plot, and the drama created in this outstanding film was riveting, but unless you have an ear for deciphering heavy Australian accents, this would of-could of been exceptional movie misses the mark just slightly.

It says more about these people's life and mind than about what makes a film good.In the brilliant crime drama Animal Kingdom there is some shooting, but nothing unnecessary or with very cruel pictures. There is no car chasing but there is some escape running, though we never follow any of the characters longer than needed. It's all there, intense, stunning and with blood. The story is clear, always balanced without any cliché, and when we as viewers enter into the character's lives, it mostly is normal and calm, just like most lives are, even if it's the one of a criminal. Then, there are the levels of individual moral standards, which we are diving into, but without making anything too obvious. There is always something unexpected behind. Never are too many words spoken, and when there is nothing to say, the scenes are guided by brilliant music, not pathetic at all.The story is brilliantly balanced, the dialogue is natural, and the acting is superb, so must the direction also have been, all the way.

The film is loosely based on the Pettingill crime family and the Walsh street killings. Everything about this film is so realistic and gritty.

83,tenealesharman,Just plain awful,2,7 May 2020,"Maybe I made a mistake watching this after the anima kingdom series. Which was absolutely brilliant.
Not one of the characters is likable in anyway, there's no way near enough information about them to explain why they are the way they are.
Jay might as well be lurch, he has next to no lines, all he does is sit in silence with a morose look on his face. Pope is crazy but we don't know why. Craig's paranoid which leads to his demise. And derrin is almost a secondary character. What's the point of Pope asking if he was gay? It's not brought up again in the movie?
And Janine aka smurf, I was preparing for this dark matriarch and she's completely irrelevant to the story, you'd forget she was in the movie. Wasn't she meant to be in control?While I'm sure this is closer to the way the pettingals actually lived, I much prefer to see the Cody's glammed up and actually benefiting from a life of crime, as opposed to what's been presented in this film, scum bags running around in trackies and thongsMassive disappointment, can't wait for season 5 of the series.

86,MovieGeekBlog,A solid crime movie!,8,24 February 2011,"This is a really tough watch And yet, it isn't the violence itself, because actually there's very little of it, but the constant sense of eerie dread and tension that permeates the whole film and makes it almost unbearable to sit through. Some of the most violent acts happen all of a sudden (hence even more shocking), towards the beginning of the film and take you completely by surprise and then, in the words of writer-director Michôd, ""you're just left with the aftermath"". Supposedly that's how violence is in real life. It's a clever device that throws the audience right off-balance from the start. From that moment onwards, we know we can expect anything at any moment. So the idea that something could happen at any point is more distressing than the violence itself. That is the most successful aspect of""Animal Kingdom"", a film that otherwise threads through a well know pattern and feels like many other crime films. But forget the jokey Tarantino of Pulp Fiction, or the epic almost-romantic Coppola of the Godfather, this is a serious crime film, and it feels real! ""Animal Kingdom"" is a drama at every turn and twist and it depicts the lives of a family of criminals in Melbourne. Obviously it all benefits from having a series of (very convincing) performances from actors who don't carry the burden of recognition. Right from the start we are catapulted in the middle of it and it's up to us to work out who's who. I did confess I was a bit lost in the beginning and took me a while to actually be able to recognise all the characters. Also I didn't think the main character (James Frecheville) was particularly interesting to watch: his face is pretty much black for most of the film, which I suppose is the point of the film (his mother dies right at the beginning and he doesn't even flinch) and yet this detachment he didn't make him particularly sympathetic and in the end I thought that was an error in judgement. As the film unfolds, slowly we begin to see how terrifying these people (animals) really are, even the most innocent looking ones: the figure of the mother, Smurf, played by Jacki Weaver is one of the scariest creation I've seen in a long time. On the surface she's a small, gentle, smiley mother who gives full-mouth kisses to his sons, but behind all that, hides the pure evil (witness a wonderful scene in which she asks for her own grandson to be killed). Her Oscar Nomination for supporting actress is truly deserved. Behind the (artificial) sense of reality, Michôd uses every trick in the book to make it feel cinematic at the same time : the slow-motion as people walk towards camera, the long elegant tracking shots (reminiscent of Scorsese's early gangster's films) and finally the music itself As if the subject matter wasn't tough enough, Sam Petty's ominous score rumbles along through the sub-woofer (that "".1″ from the 5.1 surround sound) in a series of prolonged low monotones, which you almost feel in the stomach and make those tense sequences feel even more dangerous. The only oddity, which I didn't think was needed at all, and adds nothing to the film, is the use of voice over at the beginning and at the end (especially coming from a character as blank as J). In fact, generally speaking, the script is the most un-remarkable thing about the film. When it all finally ended, I was gagging for some fresh air and I couldn't wait to go outside in the freezing cold London of these days and breath with relief This is by no means a criticism to the film, in fact quite the opposite: it's the proof that the film worked for me. Having said that, I wouldn't want to call it entertaining or want to watch it again, but I'll certainly look out for what Michôd will do next (hopefully with a more original story).

87,john-575,"Virtually ""plagarized""... another dark depressing Aussie movie",2,9 July 2010,"If you live in Victoria where this is set I'd say the script here is virtually ""plagarized"" being so closely based on lowlife real life family the Pettingill's. Take a look at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pettingill_family and you'll see the blueprint. With one or two very small changes this was all based on fact. How people here in comments and some interstate national Australia film reviewer can rave about this is beyond me. It's a strange mix of real life and story lines and locations like used in the Australian TV series ""Stingers"" The fact is if you live in Victoria and particularly Melbourne all these low lifes and their stories are so well known we are sick of them. Australia's greatest or best film?... you have to be kidding!The older brother Dennis Pettingill was a drug dealer, covered with tattoos just like the actor in the film and a real lowlife. The first brother to be killed in the film in real life was a criminal called Graeme Jensen who was shot by police. He was a best friend of Victor Pierce, Kath Pettingills son and no doubt one of the characters in this film. 13 hours later Pierce and others ambushed and shot dead the 2 police you see in the film as a reprisal.Everything about this in the film is identical including the car being left in the middle of the road. Except in the film the suburb is Hawthorn whereas in real life it was Walsh Street South Yarra. Hawthorn is a similarly leafy green suburb not far away. With the girlfriend in the film whose given a hotshot not sure about the reality of this. But Victor Pierce who was tied up in Walsh Street killing was shot dead in Port Melbourne a few years later (much like in the film). And Kath Pettingill's grand daughter died of a heroin overdose fairly recently at the age of 24. Really a bunch of lowlifes and it really irked me to pay money on the premise of seeing something supposedly fictional so close to real life. The fact that guilty people were found not guilty at the Walsh Street killing trial because some of the family members perjured themselves/retracted evidence is a further cause for distaste. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walsh_Street_police_shootings Victor Pierce got his just desserts as part of a later Melbourne gangland war very well covered in the TV mini series Underbelly. The architect of nearly 30 killings in 10 years, poor old Carl Williams ended up in jail for 35 years in a high security wing. He was killed in custody earlier this year. So crime the ways these guys work is not very glamorous, very successful or the recipe for a long life.Why do they persist in making these dark, depressing movies.

Michod has captured the Australian slum life perfectly and the degenerates that warm it. Joel Edgerton, Guy Pearce, and Ben Mendelsohn are fantastic in their roles, but the rest of the cast are mediocre at best. Mendelsohn in particular casts a terrible aura; with an apathetic and sinister attitude toward the rest of the characters. His character's unpredictability truly brings the chaos out in the Cody family.

89,martys-7,"A Mesmerazing, Menacing and Twisted Portrait of the Banality of Crime",10,28 January 2011,"Animal Kingdom tells an unforgettable realistic story of an Australian crime family. Its tone is cool and minimalist, its characters are flawed and not particularly intelligent or charismatic, its scenes embody everyday mundanity, yet the film draws you into its story of a 17-year-old youth joining his criminal uncles.The strength of the film rests on its avoidance of presenting ultra intelligent criminals, like in The Town or Takers, who perform superhuman feats outsmarting sophisticated digital systems, fighting martial artist cops, and escaping by driving against speeding traffic. On the contrary, everybody in Animal Kingdom is just too human, nobody is a perfect hero or a perfect criminal. There are no scenes of extreme machine and human noise like robbing a bank or partying at a night club. Instead, characters watch T.V. and fall sleep on the couch or shop at the supermarket. There are shootings, chases, murders, betrayals, heartbreaks, and paranoia but they occur without the histrionics or larger than life feelings so common in today's movies.A sense of menace permeates almost each scene maintaining tension throughout the entire film. At times it appears as if its all in the protagonist's mind eye because the action occurs without sound, just electronic music. Then scenes have an almost abstract quality producing a feeling of seeing the story almost in its very essence.The superb cast which includes brilliant actor Guy Pearce are perfect in their portrait of criminals and cops, none of them to be trusted. The criminal mentality in all its banality and psychosis is clearly depicted. This is an excellent film, fluid, engaging, clear-eyed, and sober. Highly recommended.",Animal Kingdom

While it's promoted as a 'slow burn' movie, it appears to be a movie that didn't know how to come off the screen. Watching it was like watching a polished story-board presentation. I don't blame the actors, much moreso the director. I got the impression he'd synthesised his realisation for this from a recent crop of TV crime dramas. Scenes meant to be brooding came across as ploddy and slow. A prime example, when Ben Mendelsohn's character, Andrew 'Pope' Cody is seen sitting alone on a couch after a revenge murder of two policemen. A long take, it fails to ignite any emotional response from the viewer, or provide anything of interest about the state of the character. Animal Kindom's biggest failing is it borders on the pedestrian as entertainment, and as a piece of story telling. No amount of PR spin saves it from being unengaging.

92,jusco15,jusco's review: Animal Kingdom,9,2 February 2011,"David Michôd's solid crime thriller from Australia lives up to all the hype and critical acclaim already lavished upon it. Not only does Animal Kingdom contain astounding performances, it is also perfectly paced with an engaging plot that isn't overdone and stays true to the gritty realism of the ominous film. It begins with teenager 'J' Cody moving in with his grandmother, 'Smurf' Cody, who coincidentally happens to be the matriarch of a family drenched in crime. Her three sons, 'Pope', Craig and Darren, maintain all sorts of dealings, from armed robbery to drugs, and 'J' is naturally swept along into the 'family business' where dangerous repercussions await the entire Cody family.I won't dwell much on the plot itself so as to not spoil it for you, but be assured, though it may not be as thought-provoking as Memento, it's got enough twists and turns to bewilder. The real treat here is the first-class acting from the entire cast, and out of the entire cast Ben Mendelsohn stole the entire show for me. His character 'Pope', the eldest Cody son, doesn't make an appearance till about fifteen minutes in, but the moment he steps into the picture he chillingly captivates the audience with his foreboding eyes, facial expressions and vocal tone. I was immediately reminded of Anthony Hopkins in The Silence of the Lambs; Ben Mendelsohn was just as terrifying and eerie. I couldn't help but watch in dreaded anticipation at his next move. I'm surprised and disappointed at the lack of nominations for any major awards for his performance; one of the best I've seen in a long while.Other standouts include Jacki Weaver, rightfully nominated for an Academy Award for playing the mother of all mothers, 'Smurf'. Calm, composed and cool are just three words to describe her character. In fact, we don't even know what's going on in her head except the fact that she's an unbelievably tough yet loving grandmother. Who else has so much power over her tattooed three sons who are drug sniffers and murderers? Yet, they can only comply when she asks them to kiss her; they love her to death. Ironically sweet.You can probably recognise Guy Pearce in his role as Nathan Leckie, the police officer who wants to help 'J' escape from the clutches of his family after they all find themselves involved in a messy situation. You're made aware of the high quality of the cast when they act on par, or even exceed this veteran's performance. And how about newcomer James Frecheville who plays our main, 'J'? For the majority of the film, he understandably struggles to live up to the standard posed by his co-actors and actresses. His attempt at portraying a teen thrust into a highly unnatural style of living with colourful family members is rather stagnant and lacking proper emotional conveyance. Yet his turning point comes three-quarters of the way in, when he proves himself worthy of the role when he breaks apart in a bathroom with an intimate, solitary crying scene.Animal Kingdom is a powerful film that examines seemingly strong but unstable family ties when caught in a web of deceit and murder. Every character is unique, their strengths and weaknesses coming into play whether it's for better or worse. The performances and story are supported by the brilliant cinematography and soundtrack. You'll be dumbstruck to the very end by one of the best thrillers you'll stumble across that will completely blow your mind.",Animal Kingdom

Films such as ""Wolf Creek"" and ""The Loved Ones"" prove that Australia can churn out some gritty, violent and disturbing films. ""Animal Kingdom"" is no exception. This movie is a powerhouse of great film making with intense performances, impeccable direction and a brilliant script. You may find yourself thinking that you've seen this story before, but you've never seen it with the same intensity and emotion.""Animal Kingdom"" is at it's heart a coming of age story in a crime family. Joshua, played by James Frecheville, is a 17 year old recently orphaned kid who's family is a mixture of drug dealers and bank robbers. Joshua's mother dies in the beginning of the film from a drug overdose and the only option he has is to go live with his grandmother. Jackie Weaver stunningly plays Janine 'Smurf' Cody, the matriarchal grandmother running everything. As Joshua gets situated in his new home he begins to find he's in a very volatile situation. One that he has to decide whether to be a part of or not. A decision that will undoubtedly change his entire life.This film is akin to Scorcese's masterpieces ""Casino"", ""The Departed"" and ""Taxi Driver"". Director, David Michôd emulated these films yet certainly made ""Animal Kingdom"" his own. As his first feature film, Michôd made it seem easy. The incredibly taut script left nothing to be desired. As in the Scorcese films I mentioned, the script was the key ingredient to make this film such a brilliant piece of work. Some crime drama's can get away with having a back story everyone knows, yet the script is sub par. ""Animal Kingdom"" is not only fresh but being from Australia it's impact is that much greater to American audiences.Joel Edgerton made a lifelong fan for his performance here. He was chilling yet completely sensitive to the plight of his family and that of his sibling Joshua. Frecheville who plays Joshua, the scared orphan brother, is brilliant. His transformation is a wonder to behold, his delivery and expressions brought out real emotion in the character. The standout performance in this film has to be Jackie Weaver as Smurf the matriarch of the clan. Writer/Director Michôd wrote the part of Janine 'Smurf' Cody for Jackie Weaver in fact, thank God she accepted the role. She has mentioned in the radio program ""Fresh Air"" that her interpretation of the character provide that all the children were fathered by different men (criminals most likely). I think this allowed her to really dive into connecting to her kin in very different ways. She is by far the highlight of the film for me.As a production the film succeeds. It's slow but detailed progression really allows the viewer to become attached to the characters and feel what they are feeling at any given moment. With a great soundtrack, gritty dark feel of the setting and brilliant acting, this one is an easy recommendation.",Animal Kingdom
95,TrevorJD,A complex story worthy of a Greek Tragedy!,9,7 August 2010,"This is a very good film though not for everybody (particularly as it is peopled with predominantly unlikeable characters). However the characters are very well constructed and the performances amazing . Ben Mendlesohn as the alpha male of the family, is menacing and disturbing as Uncle 'Pope'; his casual use of violence and the persuasive way he utilizes family members to inflict murder is horrifying when seen within the Aussie suburban milieu. Jacki Weaver is astonishing as the passive/aggressive mother, particularly when she sees her family pack being threatened from outside and within, her coldly calculating behavior becomes menacingly clear in the second half. What is astonishing about this film is how they managed to transform a tale about a little family of suburban criminals into a complex story worthy of a Greek tragedy, it is a masterstroke.",Animal Kingdom
96,MovieChamp,This movie is going to squeeze you at times. So be ready.,8,14 August 2010,"Animal Kingdom is hands down David Michod's best film yet. He has made a very powerful gangster film here. Yet I must say it is mostly do to the wonderfully played out acting. This is no Goodfellas by any means of directing skill, but the acting is around that.This movie is going to squeeze you at times. So be ready. Like most gangster movies its violent and course. This one dose reach an emotional connection with us the audience though that's rare, and it dose this fast. Some of the Characters you will like, some you will like to hate.Because of the good directing, great plot and excellent acting. I must recommend Animal Kingdom to any movie lover. Superb film. My over all score 8/10.",Animal Kingdom
97,squeerelist,The Godmother,8,14 June 2013,"Read it here: http://squeerelist.blogspot.com/2013/06/animal-kingdom- 2010.htmlThe captivating plot of Animal Kingdom follows the disintegration of an Australian crime family. Josh (James Frecheville) moves in with his grandma after his mother dies from a heroin overdose. He soon becomes trapped in a vicious spiral rooted in his family's business. The story is set in Melbourne and is inspired by the infamous Pettingill family. Cold-blooded murders, hypocrisy, drugs and more... This movie gives me everything I need to feed my sick curiosity. From the flawless cast, I'd like to specifically mention Jacki Weaver who is sublime and ferociously sweet as The Godmother. Weaver collected another Academy Award nomination for this role. James Frecheville, the introverted pawn of the story, is a true revelation. Proof is that he went on to act side by side with Robin Wright and Naomi Watts in Two Mothers. This is a sensational directorial debut for David Michôd. It usually takes a lot to surprise me but I didn't see the end coming. My heart literally jumped from my chest. I always appreciate a story like Animal Kingdom because it's what real life is about. The Codys are obviously not your typical family but the darkness, judgments and lies they deal with define the average family routine.1 reason to watch: just watch it, mate!",Animal Kingdom
98,Idgykitty,its Australian,4,28 February 2011,"And that sums it!!!!! the kid in the lead role is so wooden hes almost unbelievable.The preposterous characters mothered by Ma Baker /Barbara Windsor look a like,the whole movie just drags on from stupid scene to stupid scene,at one point I actually thought it was me not understanding that it was a comedy. I should have known going to watch a film made in the country that gave us Bluey Hills and Boney!!! Outstandingly bad .I couldn't include a spoiler alert because the whole movie is just spoilt by the ludicrous script and even worst acting.Melbourne doesn't fair to well either,o.k most cities have there seedy sides,but the city just looks dull,like the movie.A big fat no from us,it was a real struggle to stay till the end.",Animal Kingdom
99,patrickmbrame,"Repulsive, disturbing, intense, and shockingly intriguing.",9,21 March 2011,"Animal Kingdom is a roller coaster ride of emotions from start to finish that will uncomfortably get under your skin while at the same time making you more and more interested and glued to the screen. The film's protagonist is Josh, played extremely well by James Frecheville, a somewhat relatable quiet, introverted teenage boy who must live with his extended family of criminals after his mother overdosed. The extended family consists of Josh's four uncles and his grandmother, played brilliantly by Jacki Weaver (also received a much deserved academy nomination for best supporting actress). Guy Pearce also shows up in a supporting role here as the detective that is investigating the family for their crimes. At this point I feel that I shouldn't explain anymore about the story with details because what I think made this such a fantastic movie was how shocked and disturbed while also being so fascinated watching this crime story unfold before my eyes.The writing and directing of this film, both done by David Michôd, are equally brilliant. The story itself is almost Shakespearean like and some of the direction is beautifully done, but at the same time he consistently makes you feel uncomfortable in your own skin. And he does this right from the very beginning. He opens up with Josh and his mother sitting on a couch, watching a game show on TV. The mother has fallen asleep and Josh is just calmly watching the show. Seconds later, 2 paramedics walk through the front door and ask what happened. Josh unemotionally tells them that he thinks his mother has overdosed and died. No big deal. Michôd is just giving you a taste of what the remaining roller coaster ride is going to be like.What really makes this film so disturbing and repulsive are the characters themselves. In particular, Josh's grandmother, played by Jacki Weaver, and his uncle, Pope, played eerily well by Ben Mendelsohn. The grandmother or mother to the rest of the family, is very aware of what her sons profession's are (bank robbers for the most part, but mainly just criminals) and has no qualms with it. She just plays the comforting, loving mother and is there to console the boys. She reminds me very much of one of Hitchcock's mothers, a very loving and caring person, yet the most evil of them all. She mainly plays a background character throughout most of the first 2 acts until she rears her very scary and sadistic side towards the end of the film. Then there's Pope, possibly one of the best villains on screen this past year, and one that will absolutely terrify you. Mendelsohn plays him so well, and by well I mean he really brings out this subtle, disturbing, sick side of the character, that will literally make you feel distressed while watching the film. He's one of those characters that you will truly hate by the end of the film, and I mean hate with a passion yet he's probably the one character you want to see more of just to see what he'll do next. Pope is pretty much absent for the first act of the story, but not to worry, he shows up in the beginning of the second and pretty much drives the film from that point.Animal Kingdom is a must see if you have the opportunity. I take that back, It's a must see and you should go out of your way to see it. However I do warn that this is not your typical crime drama, it's extremely powerful, repulsive, and in your face about it. The direction and writing are superb and the script should have probably gotten a nod from the academy but it was a foreign film technically which put it at a disadvantage off the bat but at least Jacki Weaver got a nomination. At the heart of it, Animal Kingdom is about survival, and like in the hostile surrounding of the jungle, only the strong will survive which means doing things that we never thought we could possibly be capable. Animal Kingdom is one of those special kinds of films where long after the credits have rolled it will stick with you, and in my book that is a damn successful film.",Animal Kingdom
100,Emma_Stewart,Bloodcurdling thriller and a highly impressive debut,10,14 April 2013,"""Constant trepidation"" is a good way to describe the atmosphere of David Michod's Animal Kingdom. It's a tense, slow-burning crime drama depicting loss of innocence and a case of survival of the fittest in the man-made world. In spite of the blatantly metaphorical title it's quite a subtle film with a razor-sharp screenplay and uniformly astonishing performances.Animal Kingdom is the story of Joshua Cody, a 17 year old student who moves in with his grandmother and uncles, who happen to be a family of crime lords, after his mother commits suicide. It's implied that there was a disconnect between J (as he is known) and his mother, and he is basically a blank slate at the beginning; the film chronicles his struggle to adapt to the world he's been thrust into and the gradual decay of the innocent life he once knew.Director David Michod deserves extremely high praise for creating one of the most impressive debut films in years. His command of the film is evident in its consistently precarious atmosphere, its slow, eerie pacing and its objective tone. Michod's screenplay makes no judgments about the characters, making it clear that there is evil on both sides. It's hard to find anyone to root for, and all we can hope is that J somehow makes it out unscathed. This is a mark of brilliant screen writing: he refrains from judging his characters, so the audience never knows what to expect. There's no ""he's going to get what he deserves"" or ""he's the good guy, he'll win"" - anyone could die at any minute. Just like out there in the animal kingdom.Michod also deserves praise for his characters and dialogue. It seems like in modern crime films there's a go-to dialect for writers, go-to stereotypes for the characters to fit into. There's none of that here. The characters are distinct and very fleshed out, which is refreshing considering the genre usually calls for black-and-white, good-and-evil. Given the awe-inspiring directorial and screen writing work he did with this film, I'd bet that Michod will soon become one of the generation's best filmmakers.But Michod can't take all the credit. At the heart of the film are strong performances, particularly newcomer James Frecheville and Ben Mendelsohn, but no one approaches the meticulous brilliance of show- stealer Jacki Weaver. Weaver plays J's grandma Janine, the matriarch of the family who doesn't do any of the crime herself but instead chooses to feed off of her sons. It's one of those performances where the actor does so much more than the screenplay and director ever asked of them: the one-second-too-long embraces, the bared teeth, the unblinking and appraising staresWeaver's Janine is an enigma and an actress, and her subtle performance reveals layer after layer of a complex, chameleonic sociopath.Animal Kingdom has enough scares and tension to please the general thriller fan, but it rises above most films of the genre due to its groundbreakingly objective writing and direction, deep understanding of its characters, solemn exploration of the themes, and the best performance of 2010 by Jacki Weaver.",Animal Kingdom
101,owen9825,As dark as it gets without gore,10,8 February 2021,"I lost count of the number of times I was left gasping for air, on the edge of my seat. I seemed to become a mouth-breather like Josh, the main character.Very gritty and absolutely realistic - as an avid listener to crime podcasts, I recognised that some core plot elements here were actually based on real events.Jacki Weaver is electrifying and the male cast are convincingly sinister.I had nominated this to my American friends as something we might watch for Australia Day, but just as well I didn't - if you're looking for party vibes, balloons and rainbows, you definitely came to the wrong place.

102,kennethraine,storm in a teacup,5,13 October 2015,"I was frankly quite surprised after reading all the good reviews, that this film ,in my opinion is not even average. It starts out by implying with stills only, the families history. We witness so called violence [ red spray on glass and a bang] and ill advised, disorganised, retribution without disguise and attempts to cover their own tracks [ mandatory unless you actually like incarceration]One family member who possesses a powerful rifle or shotgun, the acquisition of which the film dwells on, actually runs away and is shot in the back, when he actually out guns them and could have shot half of them with four shots.It finishes up with the most taciturn member of the cast and the worst actor again spraying the camera with red paint in conjunction with a bang, after his girlfriend killed for no reason, presumably to facilitate the final scene.

103,EvilBaldDude,Disappointing,4,23 November 2010,"The story is what I would call pointless and meandering. It aims to be gritty and realistic, but only succeeds in being gritty, because the characters' actions often make no sense.The characters themselves are shallow cardboard cutouts, with dialog cut and paste from every ABC cop show since Phoenix. It is a tragic waste of a perfectly decent cast.James Frecheville's character is basically a block of wood, who stands around the entire film with one expression - a combination of anxiety and disbelief. Ben Mendelson tries hard to be the sinister villain of the piece, but unfortunately the plot doesn't really allow him to be all that sinister. Laura Wheelwright has nice legs, that's the only good thing I can say about the cast.It is technically competent, and the cast is decent. But at the end of the day, it suffers from a problems that plagues Australian films these days - poor storytelling.",Animal Kingdom

I have nothing against autralian cinema, any country can make a brilliant film and 'chopper' starring eric bana - was definitely one of Australia's best.

This site should be for the regular film viewers but you see positive comments for rubbish films that once they are out of cinema people will hate and even the industry and paid critics will turn their back on. The only good film out in cinema is 'the fighter' nothing else decent has been in cinema this year apart from 'ghost' obviously which was played for one day only on valentines day. Anyway, this film is rubbish and its not worth talking about so lets talk about 'chopper' a film you should watch. eric bana was brilliant and the film was violent and funny at the same time, the guy was hilarious and you just like him.

106,musings-morsels,Does Australian film industry proud,9,22 June 2010,"Animal Kingdom is a riveting insight into a 1980's Australian crime family. The film trails a teenage boy named Joshua 'J' Cody (Frencheville). Due to unfortunate family circumstances J moves in with his grandmother and mentally unhinged uncles.New comer James Frencheville portrays the slow & vulnerabe teenager, flawlessly. His pensive dopey expressions are appropriate enough to gain sympathy without rendering him useless. Jacki Weaver's performance as the grandmother is also absolutely amazing. Her sweet, doting, polite characteristics can also be seen as eerily threatening as the plot progresses.The film's intensity does not waver from start to finish and is definitely not for light hearted entertainment. Animal Kingdom is a perfect depiction of the different survival instincts & cunning decisions brought out in each person for their own survival.The one scene I can't seem to shake, is when J is on the run from his uncle and attempts to get his girlfriend's family out of their house. To avoid alarming them for their own safety, he simply asks for a lift to the shops. As the family bustles around to leave, the urgency in J's eyes enclosed by his calm demeanour was insanely nerve racking. I was so intensely enveloped in the scene I began chewing on my hair without even realising it. Not many films have ever caused me to chew on anything other than popcorn.

But I was still watching these characters, wondering: Who are these strange people? Why would they do that?There was no drama, suspense, sex, violence, comedy, anything.

110,mrtomclift,An operatic crime drama filled with palpable sensations of panic and dread,9,13 January 2011,"Up until last year, I had never been a particularly big fan of Australian cinema. Sadly, like many Australian's, I tended to dismiss local films as being cheap, uninteresting, depressing or guilty of playing up a kind of manufactured national identity that I simply didn't recognize - in the few Australian films I had seen, the landscape presented was not one that I was familiar with. As my interest in cinema grew however, I began to overcome this prejudice. That's no to say the stereotypes one might associate with Australian films are entirely unfounded; there still seem to be a disproportionate number of movies set in the bush or the outback. Never-the-less, movies from last year like Mary & Max and Balibo gave me a new found appreciation for this country's ability to produce well made, unique and engaging films. David Michôd's Animal Kingdom is another example of just that.Set against the backdrop of the Melbourne suburbs, and inspired at least partially by real life occurrences in the city's infamous criminal underworld, Animal Kingdom tells the story of a family of bank-robbers who find themselves fighting a losing war against an equally violent police force, and is told through the eyes of a teenager who finds himself caught in the middle of it all. Josh Cody has lived apart from his relatives for most of his life, but after his mother dies of a drug overdose he suddenly finds himself in the home of his grandmother Janine and her three criminal sons Darren, Craig and Andrew (also known as Pope). In this house, loyalty to one's family is everything; something that becomes a serious problem for Josh, never truly part of the family to begin with. Although there is a brief reprieve from the violence when our story begins, soon the body count begins to rise again, until the violence and paranoia of the Cody household reaches a point where Josh is forced to decide where his own allegiances lie.The fact that Animal Kingdom was written and directed by a first time film-maker is nothing short of astounding. One of the key strengths of the movie the perspective from which it is told, through the eyes of a character who, like the audience, has no familiarity with the seedy world he is suddenly thrown into. There is an enormous sense of insecurity; the feeling of living in a house where we do not entirely fit in. As Josh begins learn more about this world, we too begin to understand these people, and in turn are forced to ask the same questions that he does. What would we do? Who would we trust? Fear becomes the chief motivator for everyone; Pope, terrified of death or imprisonment, becomes more irrational and unpredictable with every passing minute, whilst the seemingly harmless Janine proves capable of going to sociopathic lengths to keep her family out of prison. All of this emotion is perfectly realized by Michôd's steady direction, who translates his script into palpable sensations of panic and dread felt by his characters and the viewers alike.Enormous credit also lies with the films magnificent ensemble cast, made up of some of Australia's finest performers. International audiences will be familiar with Guy Pearce, but it is Jackie Weaver and Ben Mendelsohn who are guaranteed to be revelations to those unfamiliar with their work. As the paranoid, violent and highly unstable Pope, Mendelsohn is completely immersed in the role of a man who you can never predict, except to say that any time he is on screen, violence is not far behind. Weaver plays a very different type of villain; insidious, calculating, and the all the more frightening because you would never expect it of her. James Frecheville, an unknown even to Australian audiences, is also strong as Josh – although his character has little in terms of range of emotion, Frecheville manages to hold his own and keep the story anchored in the face of the films more grandiose performances (and the same can be said of Pearce's level-headed Sergeant Leckie).After taking home the Grand Jury Prize at this year's Sundance Film Festival, Animal Kingdom promises' to be one of the few Australian films to receive distribution around the world. And I for one am glad to know that our nation is being represented so well. If there were one criticism of this film it would be that, as a crime drama, it is somewhat limited by its own genre – there are after all only so many ways to tell a story like this. Yet Michôd's film manages to be a crime drama that is powerful, elegant and grand without leaving the realms of real life behind it. You will understand these characters and choices they make, and you will feel the fear they experience. As the end credits rolled on this film, I couldn't help but feel an enormous sense of pride. Animal Kingdom is a piece of Australian cinema that breaks the preconceived perception of the term, and is without question one of the finest films of the year.",Animal Kingdom
111,mediumyale,"""Animal Kingdom"" is one of the best films of 2010",10,14 October 2010,"""Animal Kingdom,"" the award-winning Sundance favorite, is about a young teenager's survival in a family of dysfunctional sociopaths, headed by the diabolic, ringleader mother. The film opens with the main character, ""J"" (Josh), calling an ambulance for his biological mother who overdosed on heroin. He passively observes the paramedics checking his mother for vital signs, while glancing back and forth at the television program. Initially, the audience senses that the youngster is desensitized to a corrupt lifestyle. He calls his grandmother, Janine, played by Jacki Weaver, and is deceptively welcomed with open-arms to live with her and his four uncles, all of whom are born and bred criminals.""Animal Kingdom"" has been labeled as a crime movie, but it's much more than that. Sure, it touches on classic criminal celluloid, such as cops, robbers, drug dealers, corruption, but mostly it's about a bizarre family of criminals and the lost child trying to survive his teenage years as normally as possible. His only living proof of a normal existence is his teenage girlfriend, Nicky, whom he attach's himself to. After an act of violence occurs between the cops and one of his uncles, he spends more time at Nicky's parents' house, hoping to become accepted into their family. Substitute parenting is an important theme in the film. When two cops windup dead, J becomes the prime target of an investigation, headed by the incredible, Guy Pearce. At this point, the teenager becomes a threat to his own family and a victim of terrible circumstances.The film is crafted in a subtle manner, but the threat of danger is ever present. The writer and director, David Michod, has a keen sense for building tension; the film works by the absence of pretentious camera movements and an overwhelming score. The filmmaker brings as much realism to the scenarios as possible, saying, that these vicious crimes are committed by ordinary people, some of whom are posing as law-abiding officials.This is a modestly-budgeted film, meaning that most of the camera-work is hand-held. Now, even though I am a big fan of stylish films with kinetic camera-work, it doesn't mean it always works for the story. The writer/director of ""Animal Kingdom"" is very aware of what kind of style is best suited for this juicy story. I was reminded of other recent Sundance hits, such as ""Winter's Bone"" (2010), ""Sin Nombre"" (Without a Name-2009), and ""Frozen River"" (2008), where the conflict of the central character was organically thrilling to the narrative, and the film as a whole. Gritty realism can easily out-win pretentious style, especially when the filmmakers know they have a compelling story to tell.The primary reason I loved ""Animal Kingdom"" was because there was so much psychological and sociological depth to the family portrayal. Pay careful attention, and you'll notice how the profound elements are nicely interwoven in the subtext of the performances and direction. The film lured me into the young teenager's dilemma. I sympathized with his emotional pain and empathized with his own violent tendencies, which ironically mimic the criminal lifestyle he was trying to escape.Jacki Weaver gives a riveting and layered performance as the conniving, mama-knows-best ringleader. Her devilish, on-screen presence is reminiscent of Bette Davis in ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane"" (1962) or Ruth Gordon in ""Rosemary's Baby"" (1968). She is absolutely sizzling! ""Animal Kingdom"" builds to a jaw-dropping conclusion, an unexpected sucker-punch to the face, and it's a knockout! This is one of the best films of the year and not to be missed.",Animal Kingdom
112,hightidex,"""Pineapple Express"" With Red Paintball Guns and Australian Accents",1,23 January 2011,"The ""animals"" in this ""kingdom"" are three mentally disabled brothers, their mother (who kisses them on the mouth O, My Goodness Gracious, I'm Shocked) and their nephew who has had a lobotomy. They also have another brother who apparently wandered in from the set for ""The Lovely Bones"" (rejected for the Stanely Tucci part).There is nothing suspenseful or sinister about this movie or clan of characters. The only tension is on the soundtrack; some pinched strings. These clowns never do anything. They are as threatening as the guys in ""Pineapple Express"".This movie is like a Marx Brothers comedy. The plots lines are dropped, the narrative flies all over the place, people say and do the dumbest things... you cant imagine. The main character is Harpo Marx; because he never speaks, he is mute. There is a ""cute"" brother (Zeppo), a ringleader (Groucho) and a follower (Chico)... and in this case an extra brother, the Pedophile.The first part of the movie concerns the family hiding the Pedophile from the police because they ""have the goods on him"". When the police close in in him, they turn and blast Groucho with red paintballs. The one they have been chasing, they let walk away. The Pedophile is so upset, he gets the other two brothers to blast a couple of cops with red paintball guns. The police then have no trouble bringing the Pedophile into the station but they let him go.Understand this: the whole movie so far has been about the police trying to apprehend this guy, they kill his brother instead (for no reason), they catch him and they let him go. Got it? Up to speed? Now the movie becomes about the police trying to use Harpo to testify against his brothers. Except: he doesn't really know anything. I mean, he really doesn't know anything. He is absolutely totally useless as a witness because... he doesn't know anything.It goes on and on with characters doing the dumbest things you don't really want to know. (This person is innocent so I will kill them. This person is trying to kill me, I will go visit them.) Jackie Weaver has gotten a lot of press about her role. Her character is cut from the same cloth as Rose Tyler's mom in Doctor Who (""sexy"", overweight, blond bimbo with raccoon eyes). That character contains mountains more of emotional impact than the mother in this movie. Like everyone else in this movie, she says and does things on whims, so nothing she says or does has any meaning or impact because it is not grounded in any logic whatsoever.What a bunch of dumb animals.",Animal Kingdom

He is good enough to act as a hard-nut or anything he wants to be, but none of the other guys were believable hard nuts. Why would the very large main character run from the little weed several times? I am not very hard myself but I would never run from that guy. Come on! I understand that the movie was written and directed by a 'newcomer', so that explains a lot. But if that is the case, charge me only a dollar for watching it. The colour of the movie was green/grey/brown - almost like post-nuclear war or something. It was not very well-written; there were several sub-plots that were never finished or explored properly. And the end REEKED. Yes, of course I saw it coming. This whole situation reminds me of the Blair Witch film, actually.",Animal Kingdom
114,greybitsdmg,Very Good film,7,15 August 2014,"Loved this film. Just didn't understand, if the cops were closely watching Baz (prior to murdering him), how they didn't see Pope (who they were said to really want above anyone) who was with him at the time. Also, It was too obvious J's girl going to the house after they'd split. It didn't need that as a tipping point for J, although it did set up the finale. Nit-picking I know, but it irked me. Otherwise a surprisingly intelligent, taught, and suspenseful thriller. Even though the characterisation was obvious, it worked to move the film along. I was glad it didn't fall into cliché with J looking up the the detective as a father figure. Acting was the stand-out feature. Excellent throughout the cast. Glad I found this gem.",Animal Kingdom
115,DrPhoton,Riveting story of crime and police vigilantism,10,25 January 2010,"The backdrop to this movie is Melbourne, Australia in the mid-1980's, which (according to the director) had one of the highest per-capita murder rates in the world. At the time, there were several deaths in Melbourne in which wanted and suspected criminals were killed by the police under suspicious circumstances. These killings in turn supposedly ignited a slew of retaliatory murders perpetrated on police officers (cf. the ""Walsh Street"" police shootings).This is a movie about a young man (Josh or ""J,"" played by James Frecheville) whose extended family are all criminals. Using the character of seventeen-year-old J as a sort of catalyst, the movie explores a variety of crime-related issues, from the effects of growing up in a world where criminal activity is the norm, to the escalation of crime that is a natural consequence of vigilantism (especially when the vigilantes are police).The characters are all played very well, with exceptionally good performances given by Ben Mendelsohn, Jackie Weaver, Sullivan Stapleton and young James Frecheville in his debut as J.While ""Animal Kingdom"" starts slowly (perhaps -too- slowly for some), it continually builds in intensity throughout the entire movie, culminating with an ending that is both shocking and yet inevitable. In particular, the movie has a very compelling scene played perfectly by Mendelsohn, with an awesome supporting role played by Luke Ford - I'm sure this scene repulsed many in the audience (it certainly repulsed me). At first, I feared that the scene was added by the director merely as a gratuitous exploitation of the audience's emotions. However, as the movie progresses, the scene's outcome becomes an integral part of the plot development, and is therefore necessary for the completion of the main story.This movie will not be for everybody - the subject matter and the honest way in which the movie portrays it made the movie somewhat taxing at times to sit through. However, I think those willing to consider the necessity of telling the story of ""Animal Kingdom"" will find the movie entertaining and thought-provoking - I certainly did.",Animal Kingdom
116,lesburton,Top five best of 2010,10,26 January 2011,"Now I know for most film critics around the choice for best picture would most likely be either King's Speech or The Social Network but for me, this movie needs to be at least a strong contender. Technically speaking, the movie has a very shaky camera motion which normally wouldn't work but it does here. Everything about this movie is unstable and very polarizing. At times you wonder, how can Jay be dealing with all of these events like he is. It's just a very brutal look at this young man's life and his family very quickly spiraling out of control.The thing about this movie that cannot be overlooked is that this is an actor's movie not so much a technical achievement. Jackie Weaver is absolutely incredible and is deserving of an Oscar for this movie. The real glue that holds this story together is ""Pope"". This is such a conflicted character and is stunningly self aware of how much damage he is doing and what he still can do. His final line of the movie is pretty fitting for his character and the reaction from Jay is equally fitting.In a nutshell,this movie is one of those very rare films that come around and leave the audience breathless much like ""Training Day"". It's a very dark and sometimes haunting look at the dark side of a criminal family. This is a movie that is certain to please audiences.",Animal Kingdom
117,winston9109,"razor sharp, reaches so far beyond the spectrum of ""crime films""",10,16 September 2010,"...it's like a body, infected with a plague, tossed in a river, the poison, just seeping out, infecting everything around it.you come in at the downfall of a crime family (a mother, her four sons) and watch as the inevitable disintegration both reels in the unsuspecting and casts out it's sharpest edges, creating an incredibly dramatic cataclysm that is both quiet and treacherous.the premise is a boy, 17, who has just lost his mother, and apathetically, ""allows"" himself to be taken in by his extended and unabashed underworld family.The thing about this movie is it never lets up. There is not a moment the viewer feels likely to look away, though nothing here is easy to watch. There are several scenes during which I squirmed, my palms sweat, and actually I gasped. It is also deeply symbolic, and is not titled ""animal kingdom"" arbitrarily. You watch, mainly from the perspective of the boy, J, as he and those closest to him, (close not necessarily implying blood relationships, as he finds these may be the most dangerous)are increasingly immersed in this boiling, tragic descent. Unlike many films, AK expertly succeeds in displaying the disastrous consequences from several aspects in beautifully unfolded collection of circumstances, bringing J (and the audience) to an ultimate crossroads in finding place in ""the kingdom."" there are several memorable quotes and sequences, none of which will be spoiled in this review. The performances, to say the least, are incredibly real and convincing, and ""animal kingdom"" delivers us two of the most richly disorientated, disturbed and provocative ""villains"" to be recalled in recent film history. there is ultimately no real ""hero"" only an array of characters who offer incredible insights to the multi surfaced sides of human nature, and what lies beneath.on a final note, AK was one of the most well directed films I've seen in a while, and absolutely shatters the realm of crime drama, into something totally new and introspective, mainly due to it's cunning, realistic, and deeply complex characters to merge, collide, evolve and devolve in front of our eyes that have forgotten to blink.",Animal Kingdom

122,grinchbkb,The most tense crime drama in years,9,17 April 2011,"You have to see it to believe it, but the darkest, edgiest, meanest piece of crime fiction put on celluloid since The Prophet comes from Australia – yes, that sunny land down under...Animal Kingdom chronicles the war raging in Melbourne's underbelly between a family of armed robbers and the local police forces. Our point of entry in this highly psychopathic but chillingly functional cop-killing family is Joshua ""J"" Cody, the estranged nephew of gang leader and borderline incestuous maternal figure Mama Smurf. Joshua, a passive, taciturn teen whose emotions and motives remain for most the film unreadable, is reunited with his monstrous relatives after his mother, who kept him away from them all her life, overdoses on heroin. J quickly remarks that the members of the gang, composed of his uncles Barry, Craig and Darren, are ""all scared"". At first, we think that it's the police's gung-ho behaviour that they fear (and rightly so) but it appears that Pope, the oldest Cody brother who is still on the run from a previous heist, is that pernicious, frightening presence weighting on the family despite his physical absence.In the opening credits, first-time director David Monôd introduces a metaphor – the criminal family as a pack of lions – that he'll stretch till the end. It actually works great, giving Animal Kingdom its thematic unity and mean-spirited worldview – proof that sometimes a strong albeit limited idea can go a long way, if developed properly.So we have the lioness with Jeannine ""Smurf"" Cody, the most evil mob granny since Tony Soprano's mom, and the alpha male with Pope, who strangely reminded me of Dustin Hoffman, if Rain Man was channelling Joe Pesci. Pope's quirky behaviour is absolutely disturbing, and the aura of mystery surrounding the fear he inspires (besides being a killer, he may well be an incestuous paedophile, as his nickname would suggest) just reinforces that uneasy vibe he brings to every scene. In terms of animalistic body language, Ben Mendelsohn got it spot on, with his flabby cheeks and awkward, drowsy demeanour – in tune with the image of the lazy lion sure of his power, as seen in countless National Geographic documentaries. And if you think I am milking this simile out of proportion, just wait for the scene when the cops go for a hunt in the outlands.The film's look has nothing to do with documentary though, avoiding the naturalistic clichés in favour a very striking cinematography courtesy of Adam Arkapaw, all metallic blues and greens, with the right amount of slo-mo to coldly capture the tension, filming the protagonists in the familial home like caged animals about to devour each other. Every shot is superb, bathed in a very operatic light, displaying real pictorial flair. And while we're mentioning the technical stuff, massive kudos to the sound designer, these shrieking, feedbacking noises in the background kept me on the edge of my seat.Another detail that elevates Animal Kingdom above your average gangster fare is the insidious way it introduces the sordid, violent aspects of the underworld, in a non- flamboyant, inconspicuous way diluted in the all-surrounding casual Aussiness. You won't see a close up of a heroin needle penetrating a vein for the umpteenth time; drugs are just there, on the coffee table, and so are guns. It is quite a bold (and clever) choice, since most of us aren't used to see Aussie gangsters, and they do look like your regular ""mate"", with the surfer build, vintage tee shirts and mid-long hair. An insecure director would have felt the need to prove that his criminals from Oz are as ""hard"" as the American ones with a couple of hardcore scenes, but not Monôd, who keeps the ubiquitous vice understated.Animal Kingdom's exoticism is obviously part of its appeal, but it never spoils the film – it's authenticity more than folklore. Similarly to City of God, the geographic displacement adds some freshness to the exhausted genre, but is never overplayed to the point where the film will have to be filed under the embarrassing ""world cinema"" label.Ultimately, the core theme of Animal Kingdom is pretty universal, replaying the Mephistophelean deal already seen in The Godfather II and The Prophet: if the weak embraces evil when his time comes, he will become strong. Too bad for the moralistic ending, it is another Darwinian tale of survival after all. Can't say the title didn't warn you.ggendron.wordpress.com",Animal Kingdom
123,noazrk,Most of the situations seemed unrealistic,4,8 December 2011,"Most of the situations in the film seemed absurd. It's hard to imagine a group of cops walking up to a robbery suspect in a crowded parking lot, in the middle of the day and blowing his brains out! That maybe happened 100 years ago in the wild west but I can't imagine that happening now unless they tracked down a cop killer or somebody of that nature...but a bank robbery suspect? Unrealistic.The 2 uncles killing random cops is illogical, if they focused on the armed robbery department that would at least make some sense.Killing the main character's girlfriend was really stupid, she didn't know anything nor did she seem nervous around them so that was a waste plus it obviously was going to pit him against his uncles. If you want someone to be quiet WHY would you tick him off by killing his girlfriend? My guess at the ending was the kid was going to blame everything on the uncle who killed his girlfriend (as a witness in court) and help spring the younger uncle free so only one of them would stay in jail. The Grandma hinted at being more concerned about the younger son than the older one who initiated most of the ""sins"" anyways.

He was raised apart from his extended family until his mother dies of an overdose. He then moves in with his grandmother and her sons at the age of 17. Problem being that his uncles are, without exception, a group of sociopaths and the grandmother is the worst of the lot. Ben Mendelsohn plays eldest uncle Andrew and is the sickest mentally of the lot. Mendelsohn turns in a strong performance, exuding a truly menacing presence whenever he's on screen. Jackie Weaver plays the at once bubbly, lovable grandmother and then the utterly calculating head of the pack of thieves and murderers she has brought into the world. James Frecheville plays Josh as a mostly impassive observer of the ultimate downfall of the Cody clan. Don't hesitate to order this via Netflix or rent it from your video store.

The film is 20-30 minutes too long, and it lacks a certain energy. The film's central performance by James Frecheville is fantastic, however the character he plays is so morose and uninteresting that towards the end of the 112 minute running time you just don't care what happens to him.Certain plot machinations towards the end of the film are somewhat incoherent, and situations that could have yielded great moments are cut short or mishandled in favour of long, drawn out periods of exposition or superfluous characters. This said, special mention must be made of Joel Edgerton and Ben Mendelsohn for their first rate performances amongst a already stellar cast.However it was still a well made film, and there's much to recommend it.

Animal Kingdom did not do this element of Aussie society any justice. The 'lead' character J sounded and acted like a wet soppy rag, the Cody brothers barely displayed any menace, and mum Janine was a poor shadow of one-eyed brothel owner Kath Pettingill.I am not sure what the film was about. Was it about a crim Melbourne family? Was it about a matriarch? Was it about different lives? The cynic in me says it was a slap up job in response to The UnderBelly series and the resurgence of Melbourne hits in the past couple of years. Either way the film is not what I would call remarkable.And it plods along. Someone dies, someone shoots up, and J lurches along, bland as a dry Sao biscuit. The main reason for me watching the film was to see why Jackie Weaver earned herself an Oscar nomination in the character of Janine 'Smurf' Cody. As for the impact of Smurf, well it just didn't cut it for me. Sure she had power and a hold but the Director could have gone to town much more than he did. Weaver's performance is not worthy of an Oscar because there was no real stretch in her acting. Lynette Curran did a much better job as a mum of useless sons in The Boys, albeit a movie with a very different focus.All in all Animal Kingdom is a watchable film but nothing special.",Animal Kingdom

Mendleson is amazing as the tormented Pope and gives you chills several times throughout the movie. Guy Pierce who many remember from LA Confidential plays a great role as the detective trying to take down the family and Edgerton who everyone knows know from his big roles in US pictures plays a great but albeit brief role as one of the brothers.

Most of all, it's REAL.I know that some critics might pan the performances in this movie as being unmotivated, but I find this to be the opposite of true. The performances in Animal Kingdom are simply real. They are understated. I believed all the relationships, and throughout the story, I wasn't necessarily sure of the characters' motivations, so I didn't know what they were going to do next, which kept it moving and kept it fresh! It was definitely an indie, but that's what I LOVED. The lighting was natural. The camera work wasn't overdone and was intimate. The makeup, hair, and wardrobe was extremely minimal. It was complex in story and simple in execution, which made it... beautiful.For me, it was easily the best film I've seen so far this year.

As Josh irreversibly winds his way down the dark path that his uncles have paved for him, a kindly police investigator (Guy Pearce) attempts to reach out to the boy and save him from his inevitable demise.This film is absolutely phenomenal. Whilst Frenchville often times seemed like he'd just had a lobotomy, his quiet nature proved, in turn, to be a vessel in which to further understand the power distance between him and his uncles; Pope (Ben Mendelsohn), in particular, who stood out to be the bona fide antagonist and villain in the film.The audience follows Josh through a story of tragic loss, vengeance and climactic justice (if you could call it that).Overall, Animal Kingdom is an outstanding result for Australian Film with exceptional performances by Weaver, Pearce and Mendelsohn, fantastic cinematography and a gripping plot from start to finish.",Animal Kingdom

136,darthpaul64,engaging,9,11 August 2011,"The title ""Animal Kingdom"" plays quite a metaphorical role in David Michod's debut film, and it hits you as quick as when the title stretches across the screen. This urban crime drama is set in a kill or be killed world and only the strongest and smartest ""animals"" will survive. Unlike most other gangster flicks out there that glorify violence, Animal Kingdom only fires when necessary, and focus more on the struggle of being sucked into a life of chaos. All of the flash is removed; the family of crooks do not walk around in high-end suits, they don't spend countless nights ""on the town,"" and they don't drive around in luxury cars. The sons of ""Smurf"" (Jacki Weaver) have comfortably fallen into a lifestyle that solely involves making a dishonest buck and it seems like that is all they know. Recruiting the young and weak ""J"" into their gang was almost too easy. With his mother gone and nothing to cling on to, this ""cub"" of the family really has no choice in being a part of it.The seventeen year old boy, ""J,"" faces more trouble in a matter of days than an average person faces in a lifetime. By the sound of his toneless voice, it seems as if any character he had, was sucked out of him from the opening scene to the final scene. You can assume this stems from the death of his mother or the fear of his life as his fate quickly becomes undetermined. From what we can tell, he doesn't have many friends, if any at all and clings to his girlfriend as his only escape from the unsettling home of his ""new"" family. ""Fun"" would be the polar opposite definition of the life he has quickly adapted to.Jacki Weaver as the Grandma only plays a minor role in the film, but is a major part of how it plays out. She has the presence of a Hannibal Lector on screen and makes you uneasy with her out-of-the-norm relationship with her sons. Her big beady eyes and warm smile compliments her spine-chilling delivery of dialogue to steal every scene. She will tell the head of the academy that ""you have done some bad things sweetie"" if she doesn't win best supporting actress.Although not many are shown depicting it, the uncles of J are as tough as they come. The actors behind Pope, Darren, Craig, and Barry all give powerful performances and I would have liked to have seen more of some of them on screen. Guy Pearce, the detective in the film, seems to be the only good-hearted person in the film and delivers quite a speech to J during one of the few conversations they have. He simply tells him he as only survived because he is protected by the strong and he is weak because he is young. You can find a poster online with the entire quote if you don't want to wait for the film.The camera lingers on characters and uses real tight settings to create a more realistic, almost documentary-like style. At times, you may feel like you are sitting on the couch in the living room with the family or you pulled a chair up right next to Guy Pearce's character in his office. I actually jumped more times during Animal Kingdom than any horror film I've seen this year due to the effectiveness of silence and angle of the camera. You don't see the action, you hear it. The film's pacing feels a lot like a roller-coaster does; there are plenty of scenes with a ton of dialogue as well as fast-paced chase scenes with a booming score.This is one of the best films of 2010. It's unpredictable, intense, and will throw your emotions for a loop. I loved the ending and I thought it was a perfect way to close out the film.",Animal Kingdom
137,BigMez,The Empty Center,5,18 August 2010,"There are many good aspects to this crime movie but they're ultimately undone by a very weak main character.Things start off very promising as we're introduced to various members of the Cody family. All of whom are experienced, lifelong criminals. I'll forego the plot synopsis as it's been addressed by other reviewers. And as many other reviewers here have noted, the supporting actors all give great performances. It's true. It's the movie's greatest asset and is enough to warrant seeing this movie at least once.In terms of comparing this movie to other crime movies, it's similar to ""At Close Range"" starring Sean Penn and Christopher Walken. That movie was also about a young man being introduced into a tight knit family of criminals led by a paranoid and dangerous patriarchal figure.But the movie's strength also points to a glaring problem: the main character is a dull pill with zero personality. He's merely a pawn to be moved this way and that as the story dictates. He doesn't have any ambition, nor does he strive to improve his lot in life. As such, it's impossible to care what happens to him. Again the burden of story falls upon the other family members and the choices they make to keep things going. All of whom are far more engaging and fascinating than 'J'. As the family members are done in one by one, the number of interesting characters begins to dwindle. And with it, the viewer's interest in what's gong on.It'll be interesting to see what this filmmaker does next. He definitely has a grasp on effectively telling a good story, and he understands when to reign in his actors and when to unleash 'em. I hope next time he invests more time into developing his main character as he does his supporting ones.",Animal Kingdom

Every character is connected to every other as if by springs quivering with tension or compression and the movie really delivers holding the resolution to the final frame where everything shifts into a new alignment.I really enjoyed Animal Kingdom, it does not glamorize the life of these crims the way Underbelly or Sopranos does, and the cops reflect the dirty history of the Melbourne's finest too (Guy Pearce reprising his role in LA Confidential as a rare Mr Clean).

As the body count builds even a car slowly reversing down a driveway becomes a menacing sight. The ending is satisfying.The film is very well acted, young Frecheville keeps it natural and holds his own amongst titanic performances from veteran Aussies. Mendelsohn as Uncle Pope is particularly brilliant, dressed at Christmas from Lowes, this dorky suburban thug bullies the weak (including his passive younger brother Darren, unhappily entrenched in a life he cannot escape from), and who's confrontational behaviour springs from a deep well of paranoia. His maladjusted moral compass so skewed he frequently crosses into psychopathic territory. And yet he remains all too human, he's a mundane monster. Weaver too, leaves a memorable impression, where revelations abound in the film's third act.My only complaint is that I would have liked to have seen a courtroom scene that is left to the imagination, we see corrupt police in action, why not a demonstration of hypocrisy in the justice system too? But this is a minor whinge in the grand scale of this ambitious story.",Animal Kingdom
140,filmjournal-97579,Total Animal Wisdom,8,2 February 2016,"Great Australian crime-drama. Set in Australia, Animal Kingdom follows the story of ""J"", a young man who is taken in by his Granny after the sudden death of his junkie Mother. While in the company of his Grandmother and Uncles ""J"" finds out that they are involved in some of the worst crimes that have been taking place in Melbourne, in the eighties. What now stays in front of him is to try and find his way out of their clan or become one of them. The film delivers a great deal of realistic energy and feel of realism. This realism is achieved through the unfolding story whose logic is unrelentingly factual, and the extraordinary acting of a number of the players, including Jacki Weaver, James Frecheville, Ben Mendelsohn and Guy Pearce. Although violent, the film is to be commended for not celebrating crime and violence. The scenes of violence are short, unexpected, energetic, delivered briskly without lingering on unnecessary gore effects and details. The characters and violence are simply what they are, and all the more authentic for it. Great first feature debut by David Michod as a director. Highly recommended.",Animal Kingdom

A dark and captivating.The Melbourne Gangland Killings ended only a few years prior to this film's release, the contextual awareness of Melbourne's underbelly really shows through.Any US productions of this storyline will never do it justice in comparison to this film.",Animal Kingdom
142,alexbell220,A psychological crime drama set in the Melbourne's underworld,4,14 May 2010,"It is common knowledge that Australian movies have not done particularly well for at least two decades. Whilst the best of the worse have been showered with accolades and (insider) awards, all have failed miserably at the box-office and have for the most, lost their audiences, both nationally and internationally. There are of course rare exceptions, very rare exceptions.In fact, the plight of the Australian film industry was so bad, that various funding bodies, three years ago were amalgamated into one super bureaucratic nanny body called Screen Australia, who claimed, that from now on, they were going to lift their game, ensure that only quality projects got priority funding i.e. projects with broad audience appeal, the goal being to win back Australian audiences.At first glance, this may not seem relevant to a critique of Animal Kingdom, but, as you will see, it is. Animal Kingdom has received much hype - it even won a major award before it was publicly released! It's obvious then, that investors and filmmakers would like to make this one a winner i.e. to win back not only Australian audiences, but international audiences.But this, I fear, will not occur. Animal Kingdom, whilst presenting a few bright moments, is overall very slow and ponderous. There is very little, if any, character development and the characters themselves are, for the most, unlikable and anti-heroic. The relationships between the main characters are also underdeveloped. e.g. between Smurf and J and J and his girlfriend. Who are these people? What are their goals? What are they striving for? Three quarters of the way through the movie I realized I'd never know.This is not the kind of movie that will win back Australian audiences, let alone international audiences, in fact it would have been more suited to television. Dramatically, it fails on almost every level, because the characters are obnoxious, predictable and cliché. I could not relate to any of them, and towards the end was hoping they'd all die. For audiences to invest in the main characters, they need to relate to them, to barrack for them, to laugh and cry with them, to feel their pain and joy. Unfortunately, in Animal Kingdom, the character were not developed enough to make this connection.",Animal Kingdom
143,surajsplace,Slow Boring and Avoidable.,2,14 May 2011,"I saw the good ratings and the nice comments on IMDb so decided to give it a shot. I like dark movies but this one is utter garbage. The plot is not worth the time. The last 15-20 minutes is some what watchable. The movie is painfully slow and the characters don't gel well with the plot. The acting was so awful that more than half of the movie I thought the lead character ""Joshua"" was mentally challenged or something. I don't think the writer had any idea what he was writing he just picked up some ideas from one movie some from another and went about writing this garbage.I don't think the movie had a director as the movie had no direction :P. Furthermore what I don't understand what people liked in this waste of time, probably they dozed off and saw a dream or something. Avoid it and save your time.",Animal Kingdom
144,centrix64,Worth seeing,6,30 January 2011,"A very slow starter, Animal Kingdom plods along throughout the first three quarters of the picture, and then finally takes off into a tight ascending spiral for the conclusion.Aside from the excellent job Jacki Weaver (""grandma"") did, the rest of the acting was average (not a bad thing, I've seen a lot of well below average lately). Filming, camera work was excellent. Both combined for a nice gritty ""real life"" feel and conveyed the whole depressing environment very well. I've never been to Oz, let alone experienced normal every day neighborhoods, so I'm not sure how realistic everything was.Overall, AK is worth experiencing. But I would re-adjust the rating to about 6.6, which is 1 point less than the actual rating (and it's what I always subtract to compensate for the fluffy ratings here on IMDb).",Animal Kingdom
145,TheWatchingCamel,"Underwritten, underacted, under-directed, and all the better for it",8,24 June 2012,"Living in Melbourne when this film came out, I was suspicious of it. The local media massively over-hype any half-decent Aussie film and so many of those tail off disappointingly after a good first hour.Not so, with Animal Kingdom.It could so easily have been overdone: there could've been lingering shots, moralising or a dreadfully over-played ""initiation scene"" where J is forced to confront the reality of his family's criminality. But there's none of that.Put simply, it is a masterclass in understatement.The script is taut and trim: no excess baggage, unnecessary scenes, or showy dialogue, and it's completely believable from the first shot - perfectly capturing the darker side of an otherwise pleasant city.James Frechville is convincing as 17 year old J, and his performance perfectly captures the wide-eyed shock, fear and disbelief his character must feel, and he becomes more and more believable as the film progresses and his character slowly finds his confidence. Ben Mendehlson also impresses as the quietly sociopathic eldest uncle.Because it's so understated, it sucks you in, and after an hour I found myself rooting for J, feeling disgusted when he caved in to his family's pressure and a surge of pride in the young lad at the ending (which is punch-the-air perfect).Well worth an hour and 50 of your time.",Animal Kingdom
146,scott-lang34,TERRIBLE screenplay ruins what could have been an excellent movie.,3,26 May 2014,"Everything that happens in this film is wrong. 1) The one good brother that wants to exit his family's life of crime is MURDERED by cops in a grocery store parking lot, which leads the other brothers to exact revenge on them. Now, if you're going to base a film on the investigation of these 2 cops' murders, you have to make me want to see the killers brought to justice. The motivation isn't there because you feel that the cops should've rightly been killed. 2)When the paranoid uncle sees the cops coming for him, he does the absolutely most illogical thing he could think of: grab his shotgun and run directly into a wide open field where he is subsequently shot and killed. All he had to do was nothing and he would've be aquitted of the crime just like his other 2 brothers. 3)The girlfriend goes to the lead's house and doesn't even confront the uncles about having the boy break up with her. Why the hell did you go over there then?!4) The lead runs from a cop who blatantly tries to kill him while in witness protection, and he doesn't go straight to Guy Pierce, the ONE GUY who wants to help him and tell him about it?5)While being transported to trial, a cop directly points his gun at the lead and dry fires it for NO REASON. I shouldn't have to go into why this shouldn't have happened. 6)The lead undermines the police's entire investigation to get his uncle's off, which makes you not care about him AT ALL anymore, or his scumbag family. He did it to murder his eldest uncle himself, and then embraces his grandmother lovingly who, for the previous 15 minutes, was trying her damnedest to have him killed. He also chose to spare his gay(?) uncle, who was also complicit in his girlfriend's murder! He just sat there and watched it happen!I really could go on but i'm nearing the 1k word limit and I think you get the point.I really wanted to enjoy this movie going in; it's competently shot, the actors are good (besides the dry performance by the lead), cinematically it is top notch. But everything that happens in it is wrong, and it infuriated me to the point where I had to write this review about it.",Animal Kingdom
147,info-397-683284,An Aussie episode of Law and Order,2,21 June 2012,"The box says it's the Aussie answer to Goodfellas, but it's more like a cheesy episode of Law and Order. There is a certain reality to the low life family at the center, but there is no reason to care about any of them...briefly we might care about J because he's young and innocent, but the actor plays exactly one emotion: Sullen, and his wishy washy stand is never justified nor redeemed by cold bloodedly killing his uncle.There is tragedy after tragedy, but why do we care? Camera-work is pretty good for low budget, but again more like TV than a feature film. Acting is passable but only the mother is at all convincing...but not always. It may try to be about ""reality"" but no attention is paid to the reality of the young girl who is murdered for absolutely no reason making this into the worst kind of porn: violence for the sake of shock value only. If you want to see the brutal reality of life Down Under (okay, it's New Zealand not Australia, but it has a lot to say) watch Once Were Warriors. If you want to see the inner workings of a low level crime family try At Close Range. Don't waste your time on this tripe.",Animal Kingdom
148,yurimeister,Finally a world class film...,9,23 February 2011,"Without being harsh on the Australian Film Industry, it's been a long time since I've been really excited about a film, let alone proud of one. Finally I can say that the wait is over. Animal Kingdom is seen through the eyes of a recently orphaned teenager, Josh, who is taken up by his estranged relatives. They are presented as real, almost good hearted people with a less then normal line of work and lifestyle.A great part of why this film succeeds is that it set after a series of of events, centering on the consequences of their lifestyle and their own survival as the rules of the game they started playing suddenly change. As their lives become more complicated, Josh is inevitably drawn in, even as much as he tries to stay out. The story twists and turns without ever getting out of hand, everything is set firmly in the urban reality we live in.The cast is first rate with great acting throughout - special mention in particular for Ben Mendelsohn, Jacki Weaver and Guy Pearce who were outstanding. The Cinematography is gritty and simple, soundtrack is good and helps firm the film up; there are not many flaws in the production. It's not exactly the Godfather, and it's not like any kind of American crime film, and thats why it works - because it does a great job of humanizing the antagonists. Maybe like the Godfather, it is all about the characters and their trials, there are few 'good guys', just people in different shades of grey. It is not so much about the literal violence, but the psychological games, the power struggles and the death of innocence. Animal Kingdom is a brooding, intelligent and intense film for viewers of an equal calibre. If you like a good drama/crime thriller give this one a go, you'll come back begging for more as this beast has quite a bite.",Animal Kingdom

150,hayirdirisallah,This director is a genius,10,27 July 2012,"The criminals are human too! David Michod shows us how they act - as normally as a normal person- and how they kill somebody - as normally as a normal person - without ceremony, without rituals. Even the theme stops, because in the murder scene there's no theme, there's only just two person; the one who kills, the others who dies. If there's a theme event the killer have to see his shrink. This is absurd. In this film nothing is absurd, and I think this situation is absurd at all. further more there is no catharsis. Director never let us to feel o.k. There's only one difference i,n the Way thru film, the face of the ""grandma""... She's little tired at the end. How can't she? I think this film is the masterpiece of simplicity.

151,trout-1986,An Aussie crime story,8,14 October 2010,"I'm from Australia, though thankfully not the ""world"" this story takes place in. From the little exposure i've had to this environment i think this film holds up very well, realistic characters, the seedy Melbourne backdrop and the option-less, obliviously neglected, inward teen at the center of the tale. It all comes off as very real, I feel like i almost know these people, have been to the these places, gone to school with this kid. I also enjoyed seeing some of our top end talent on display in Guy Pierce and Joel Edgerton. Having just seen Ben Mendleson around in different shows here and there i will definitely be taking more notice from now on. The film is a beautifully accurate and terribly sad insight into a side of my country that's stories rarely reach the rest of the world via the medium of blockbuster movies, no crocodile Dundee bullshit here. The Aussie movie industry of the past ten years yields some genuine gems, Chopper, The Proposition, Two Hands, Noise, The Square and more. Although few and far between we are steadily producing more and more quality films. I think Animal Kingdom is definitely towards the top of that list. Overall i found it to be a chilling, powerful, grimy urban flick about the very low value of life in the criminal world and reminded me how lucky i am not to be near it.",Animal Kingdom

I had heard great reviews about this film and to my surprise there was virtually nobody in the cinema. It started off very slow introducing all the characters but as the film progressed the gripping story unraveled. I felt myself on the edge of my seat on numerous occasions. The acting is very strong and directional work is exceptionable. From start to finish the film is an intense ride, that not many films manage to achieve very well. There were a few faults, mostly with the very fast paced ending, which left me in a little bit of confusion, but overall this film is very enjoyable and worth your money to see and help support Australian cinema.8/10",Animal Kingdom
153,caveat-venditor,A certain amount of Ausie jingoism,4,23 January 2011,"On the whole I found AK interesting enough to keep my attention through to the end, however not all is perfect in the Kingdom and I want to address the balance as most of the IMDb reviews seem to think this is another LS&TSB's, whereas some aspects from the Goonies were evident. Of course I'm being churlish, but am I alone in thinking that; The timing was very bumpy with moments that were positively so out of kilter that it reminded me of an art movie; the 1st assassination being a point in question. In some critical areas the dialogue was so muted many of the audience felt the need to 'whisper' to their companions ""what did he say?"" At times picture quality kept reminding me of the Blair Witch Project – out of focus, dated and jerky. The plot has many annoying holes; why did the police let public enemy number one go when they wanted him so badly they were prepared to perform a public murder to get their hands on him and how would the bent copper have wasted the boy if he had surrendered with the squad? OK the Smurf is as mad as a hot pot full of crickets, but her insanity could have been emphasised to a higher level that could have placed her in the realms of Hannibal Lector or Rose West. I believe there is a certain amount of Ausie jingoism going here on that is resulting in such high reviews, when really they should be saying ""not a bad little movie for an Australian attempt"". A good 4 out of 10.",Animal Kingdom
154,seanr-753-169050,Highly disappointing,5,31 May 2010,"A winner in Sundance, Animal Kingdom comes with high praise and credentials. It certainly doesn't lack for ambition, and its central premise is intriguing. Unfortunately, some disappointing acting and a thin storyline mean that the film's potential is mostly unrealised. Despite large levels of critical praise, Ben Mendelsohn's performance is not significantly different to that he's given in previous works; if you didn't like him there (and many don't) you won't like him here, either. I personally found him flat and unemotive. He is, however, a world better than newcomer Frecheville, whose performance begins, ends, and aside from one tearful scene, continues throughout upon a single note. In addition, the storyline is thin and full of plot holes. Several characters feel superfluous (Luke Ford's Darren would be the most prominent) and almost all feel underwritten. (Only Jacki Weaver's Smurf is allowed much in the way of coherent motivation; the only other female character of note, Laura Wheelwright's Nicky, feels entirely like a plot point rather than an actual person.) On the other hand, the dialogue is lively and original for the first two-thirds of the film (although it begins to noticeably degrade thereafter) and some of the performances are stellar: Jacki Weaver in particular stands out. Smurf becomes a creature of great ambiguity in her agile hands, never quite showing all her cards yet projecting a wealth of mixed emotions below the surface. Sullivan Stapleton, as Craig, is phenomenal: A crackling, electric figure of cocaine fueled violence, indecision and paranoia; he recalls Eric Bana's marvelous turn as Chopper Read in Chopper (2000) as neither seem to have much control or awareness of what they will do next. Joel Edgerton is under used but excellent as Baz, the more cautious voice within the group. He carefully creates a persona of fragile calm obscuring panic.The real star of the film is its director, David Michôd. His direction is confident and assured, he's not afraid to leaven the drama with bursts of black comedy, and even as the film goes off the rails toward the end, his choice of composition never falters. Given a better scriptwriter, he has every chance of delivering stellar work in the future.",Animal Kingdom
155,mikelloyd-au,Blinder of a movie,10,6 June 2010,"This is a superb movie, with tension building from start to its very clever finish, and an excellent plot. The characters and acting are all beautifully realised. Yes, the characters are not particularly likable or interesting people and they seemingly fail to learn from their actions, but this is the whole point. The opening scene, in which young Josh is more interested in a TV show than his mother dying before him, pretty well sums up this family. As such, they are much more believable as people than most characters you will see in a movie or TV show. Overll, a huge contribution to film, and as good a crime movie as you will seen anywhere.",Animal Kingdom

157,rockyblindside,Bushranger Mythology?,9,17 December 2010,"What happens when the fabric of society breaks down? When the law is flaughted and both sides of the divide pay it no heed? Animal Kingdom is a retelling of the outlaw story in suburban Australia, however rather than adding to Kelly Gang mythology, is this a challenge to the myth..? The production is solid, capturing a time and place. Like an '80s Aussie soap, but with good old Jacki Weaver playing the Ma Baker character. The acting is solid and the cast well chosen except perhaps Ben Mendelsohn as ""Pope"" who may lack the required menace for the part. James Frecheville as the observer and central character ""J"" is fantastically understated.While the film references traditional Greek mythology in the form of Oedipus (Smurf) and Aries (the overthrow of the tyrannical father figure), it has a clear focus on a more local Australian mythology. It has to be said that the local mythology recalls its outlaws in soft focus. The underdog, the battler, fighting with his mates against a corrupt system. This offers a sharp unsentimental view of the outlaw as part of Australian mythology.I suspect that this film will resonate in the history of Australian film.",Animal Kingdom
158,thedesperado,"Excellent portrayal of a ""non-traditional"" Family",8,13 April 2011,"I just finished watching Animal Kingdom, and have to say I was pretty impressed with this Australian film. Slow as it may seem to some, I thought every scene was well thought out and executed. The violence is quick and precise, the gore kept to a very tasteful minimum, and the story moved along nicely. The acting took a little to get used to, but aided in the characters over all development. J (main character) at first seems very distant but then as the story progresses you get the reason why. For me this was a perfect portrayal of family, and what it means to be apart of a family. Some get angry easy, others let everyone else take care of the problems and issues, and others have no idea what is going on half the time. I thought the writer did an excellent job, as did the actors, in capturing all these little facets. Great movie, I enjoyed it. A warning to some; don't go into this expecting/ thinking it is going to be another Goodfellas (my personal favorite) or a twist on Godfather, or American Gangster.

It is a character based film, with surprising and complex situations. Each new turn, pushes the preconceptions of each roll to discover layers upon layers of emotional conflict. In Animal Kingdom is the survival of the fittest that prevails over family ties. Director David Michôd doesn't have to be flashy to construct an intense story full of dysfunctional relationships.

Unfortunately, for me, I did not enjoy this film.The plot is based around the true events of the Walsh Street Killings. The part of the film that had the most impact upon me was the execution of the two police officers, as it is a very close representation of the real event.The fact is that with all the moral gravitas that such an historical event freely provides a filmmaker (especially if, like me, you remember the actual events) I felt as though film does little to honour the officer's memory's. The whole third act is utterly implausible, as the character of the young man and his actions are things no real human being would do.I am glad I only hired it as I considered buying it based upon the positive reviews and AFI nominations.
