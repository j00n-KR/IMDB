0,Leofwine_draca,Incredible trash - how was this made?,1,21 November 2014,"After watching this, I can't actually believe it was funded or made. Or that the guys behind it were the Wachowski brothers, who of course made the fairly decent MATRIX films all those years ago. Or that there were some decent actors in support, including John Goodman and a briefly glimpsed Hiroyuki Sanada.Anyway, SPEED RACER is pure rubbish. It's so bad because it's a film made entirely via CGI and greenscreen, so that everything you see in the movie is fake, too bright, too colourful, too unrealistic. The graphics are worse than in many modern computer games, and given the predominance of computer graphics throughout I'm left wondering why they just didn't make an all-out animated movie. It would have made more sense.In any case, this is one of the worst I've ever seen. The story is some clichéd old nonsense about a guy whose older brother dies in a racing accident, so of course he himself becomes a racer. The bad guys are completely lame and half the running time seems to be given over to some would-be comedy antics involving a fat kid and a chimpanzee. Unsurprisingly the acting is terrible and the run-time is interminable, leaving me very tempted to switch this off partway through. Somehow I managed to make it to the end, but never again.",Speed Racer
1,SnoopyStyle,Gaudy style overwhelms without the excitement of real stunts,5,22 March 2014,"Speed Racer (Emile Hirsch) grew up idolizing his older brother Rex (Scott Porter). When they barely survive a bomb, Rex runs away to race for somebody other than Mom (Susan Sarandon) and Pops (John Goodman). Now Speed Racer is a grown up and a brilliant racer with his childhood girlfriend Trixie (Christina Ricci).Nobody could ever call the Wachowski Brothers bland. They are certainly very bold with their style and this is no exception. However the gaudy colors, and cartoonish style doesn't make the racing that exciting. It's all flash and fury signifying nothing. I rather have a few real stunt car driving. The style overwhelms everything.As for the story, who could really pay enough attention to keep up? The visual overload distracts the audience and confuses everything. Any possible tension is drained away by the ridiculousness of everything.",Speed Racer
2,gavin6942,"Poor Marketing, Good Film",6,24 May 2008,"Young Speed Racer is in constant admiration of his older brother Rex Racer. Coming of age, Speed becomes a great driver himself, possibly the best in the world. Who is Racer X? What is the story with the evil gang who tortures people with piranhas? And is it better to be independent or join up with a billion dollar corporation in order to get the best gear? I've been a fan of Speed Racer for some time. I grew up watching reruns on late night television (it's a 1960s show, and I'm a bit younger than that). I have a Speed Racer shirt that I love wearing. So when I heard a film was coming out and starring one of my favorite actresses, Christina Ricci, as Trixie, I was intrigued. But then I saw the trailer and my heart sank. It was all digital animation and looked about as boring as watching NASCAR.At fault here are the people who made the trailer. If this film fails, it's the poor advertising. Who cares about seeing race scenes? The focus should have been on the actors. The trailer doesn't tell you that this film stars heavy-weights like Ricci, John Goodman, Susan Sarandon and Matthew Fox. Very little of the movie actually takes place on the race track. Goodman in particular is quite good (as usual) and Fox isn't as wooden as he is on ""Lost"".I'm still not a fan of CGI or computer animation in general. But, to be fair, in order to turn a 1960s anime into a live-action film, I think the Wachowski brothers (""Matrix"") did about as good as can be expected. At least they used a real chimp for Chim-Chim. The animation didn't bother me. In fact, my only real complaint was with Ricci. I miss the days of the pudgy Ricci. This new one, who needs to eat a sandwich, doesn't have the appeal or charisma as she did in her younger days.""Speed Racer"" will not be for everyone. The humor is unusual, the characters are strange (on purpose) and exaggerate Japanese culture quite a bit at times. The film strives towards PG, but includes situations that would have worked better with a PG-13, so it comes off as awkward at times. But I really thought this would be a bigger disappointment. I enjoyed ""Speed Racer"", and for anyone who is curious I don't think they should shy away.",Speed Racer
3,jboothmillard,Speed Racer,7,3 June 2016,"The Wachowskis (Bound, Cloud Atlas) have come a long way since directing The Matrix franchise, in fact both brothers have made the transition to become openly transgender women, Larry is now Lana and Andy is now Lilli, this process started happening around the time of the release of this film, when they were still credited as The Wachowski Brothers (Lana was still Larry then). Basically in near- distant future, eighteen-year-old James ""Speed"" Racer (Into the Wild's Emile Hirsch) has always had a love and life for automobile racing, since he was in school, he is now the youngest driver in the WRL (World Racing League) with natural racing instincts. Speed's ultimate dream is to win the Casa Cristo Cross Country Rally, also known as The Crucible, this race took the life of his older brother Rex (Scott Porter). Speed is loyal to his family's independent business, Racer Motors, run by his parents, Pops (John Goodman) and Mom (Susan Sarandon), Speed is using his brother's car, the Mach 5 and his own Formula One car the Mach 6, both designed by his father. The owner of conglomerate Royalton Industries, E.P. Arnold Royalton (Roger Allam), makes a lucrative offer to sign to race with him, and have an astoundingly luxurious lifestyle, Royalton is angered when he declines. Then Speed uncovers a secret that many races are being fixed, top corporate interests, including Royalton, are cheating to gain profit, having denied his offer Royalton wants to ensure that that Speed will not win races. Speed has the support of his parents and his girlfriend Trixie (Christina Ricci), he enters The Crucible, and he is going against his one-time rival, the mysterious masked Racer X (Lost's Matthew Fox), Speed seeks to rescue his family's business and the racing sport itself. In the end Speed wins the race, Royalton's crimes are exposed, and a flashback reveals Racer X is in fact Rex, he faked his death and changed his appearance with plastic surgery as part of a plan to save his family and the sport of racing, he chooses not to reveal his identity to his family, Royalton goes to jail and the Racer celebrate Speed's victory, Speed and Trixie kiss. Also starring Paulie Litt as Spritle Racer, Benno Fürmann as Inspector Detector, The Wolverine's Hiroyuki Sanada as Mr. Musha, Rain as Taejo Togokahn, Shaft's Richard Roundtree as Ben Burns, Edge of Tomorrow's Kick Gurry as Sparky and Run Lola Run's Moritz Bleibtreu as Grey Ghost. Hirsch does well as the young racing hero, Goodman and Sarandon get their time as the parents, and Allam is a suitably dastardly villain, this film is based on a cult 1960s anime show, which would explain why the world in which the characters inhabit is digitised, the backgrounds and fast-paced race sequences are filled to the brim with vibrant colourful special effects CGI, this adds to the spectacle of it, all the family will watch and enjoy entering a different dimension, a most fun sports action comedy. Very good!",Speed Racer
4,ccthemovieman-1,A Wild Ride Of Colors & FX,7,26 September 2008,"If you're into color, this film is for you. It's hard to imagine a movie with more and bolder colors and wild action that is presented here.The story is predictable and a bit juvenile but I'm an older guy. For kids and most of the family, this should be very enjoyable. For those, like me, who like special-effects and stylish visuals, it was definitely worth a look, particularly on a Blu-Ray hi-definition disc.Many of the characters were over-the-top, especially the villains, naturally, led by Roger Allam as ""Arnold Royalton."" The good guys - meaning ""Speed Racer"" and his family, were okay. It was odd seeing Susan Sarandon and John Goodman playing the parents, but, that's Hollywood. The younger brother ""Sprittle"" (Paulie Litt) and the chimp, I'm sure, drew most of the laughs from most audiences.This film, however, is not really about the story or, more specifically, about futuristic auto racing, although if you love auto racing you should like this - it's about the incredible colors and special-effects extravaganza. Hey, the guys who made this movie made the three ""Matrix"" films, so that should tell you something.",Speed Racer
5,ma-cortes,Pleasing and grandly amusing adventure about a crack racer based on a Japanese classic cartoon,7,23 August 2009,"This tale starts with Speed Racer (Emile Hirsch), he is an aggressive, impetuous, and brave crack pilot to win breathtaking world races. He lives with his mom (Susan Sarandon) and Pops racer (John Goodman) who designs a fabulous car along with a mechanic(Kirk Gurry), the Match 5 . The proprietary of Royal Industries does him a lavish offer but he rejects it. And he also uncovers a dark secret about the biggest races are being fixed . Speed Racer must save the sport he loves and his family racing business. Then Speed join forces with his one time rival Racer X (Matthew Fox) to win ¨Casa Cristo¨ rally , a cross country race, competing against dangerous racers and a shifty Japonese racer(Rain) and ultimately the ¨Grand Prix¨.This exciting movie contains thrills, action-packed, tension, suspense and overwhelming races, but also some commercial elements. This is a dynamic, fast-paced and amusing movie. Full of action, its complemented by silly comedy in charge of a little boy and a monkey. The picture relies heavily on the overlong and death-defying races that are incredible and magnificently made by 3D computer generator. The story moves like a supersonic bullet for most of its running time and the last generation of fantastic cars steal the show. Contrived beyond belief with spectacular races that play like video games, but slickly calculated to please 2000 audiences and children especially. Emile Hirsch as valiant racer is good, he's an instinctive, stubborn and valiant young man. Susan Sarandon and John Goodman are sympathetic as his affectionate parents and Christina Ricci is beautiful as his love interest. Colorful cinematography plenty of pastel and glimmer color by David Tattersall. Impressive and groundbreaking production design by Owen Patterson. Stirring and moving musical score by Michael Giacchino, usual of J.J. Abrahams movies. The motion picture is well directed by the brothers Larry and Andy Wachowski adapting the famous Japonese anime . The Wachowski, also screenwriters(Speed Racer, V for vendetta)achieved his big success with Matrix trilogy and here get another great hit.",Speed Racer
6,BA_Harrison,Like Wacky Races on acid for over two hours—it hurt my brain!,2,29 May 2010,"After two progressively worse Matrix sequels, the Wachowski Brothers flush their directing careers even further round the U-bend with this dreadful live action version (well, live action aided by tons of heavily stylised CGI) of the little-known (here in the UK, at least) 60s Japanese animated series Mach Go Go Go.The film stars Emile Hirsch as 18-year-old Speed Racer, a gifted driver whose talent behind the wheel results in the offer of a lucrative racing contract from E.P. Arnold Royalton (Roger Allam), owner of conglomerate Royalton Industries. But when Speed declines the generous offer, preferring to trust his family, Royalton reveals himself to be a vile power-hungry tyrant who fixes races and vows to ruin anyone who defies him.With a $120m budget and a solid cast at their disposal, one might at least expect the Wachowskis to deliver a fun, PG-rated action flick—nothing too substantial or taxing on the brain, but entertaining enough to keep both kids and adults consistently happy for the duration; instead, the pair have concocted an unnecessarily complex script to baffle the young ones, have included an irritating fat kid and his chimp to annoy the grown-ups, and have gone all-out to indulge their artistic whims, turning Speed Racer into a visually nauseating neon nightmare packed with cartoon-like race sequences that are almost impossible to follow thanks to the use of retina-scorching, day-glo visuals and ridiculously rapid editing.Even when it's possible to keep track of what the hell is going on, the action still fails to excite, being way too artificial to be wholly engaging: cars leap yawning chasms with ease, collide mid-air, and spin wildly out of control, and yet somehow manage to continue racing. It's the kind of crap that could only possibly appeal to avid gamers who spend the majority their lives divorced from reality, or rabid anime fans who would watch almost anything, so long as it is based on something Japanese. I'm neither, and I found the whole affair thoroughly tedious.Well, that is except for the few scenes featuring the lovely Christina Ricci: she's one visual delight even the Wachowski's digital overload couldn't ruin for me.",Speed Racer
7,Quinoa1984,"when it's a dumb, colorful B-movie from an anime show, it works. when it goes for plot, it... doesn't so much",6,27 May 2008,"Leave it to the Wachowski brothers, masterminds behind the Matrix and V for Vendetta, to take something of a cult item like Speed Racer and try and turn it to a summer blockbuster. It wasn't so bad trying to make it into a movie, but the ""summer"" and ""blockbuster"" parts are trickier, particularly when up against the heavyweight competition (which, as with Indiana Jones and especially Iron Man are, to be fair, better movies). In their attempt to make a movie suitable for kids they did a job better than expected, but it's also a nutty piece, a film brimming with a cavalcade of colors and CGI gimmickry that's akin to Nascar on LSD. Like the show, it works best for a cult audience- either fans of the show or those who are little kids (under 10) or can tap into that side of themselves now and again- and it's not surprising it didn't do well at the box-office. In another part of the year, maybe, it would've done better.I would like to report that it's the most underrated flick of the season, but I'd be lying. It is a flawed movie, where the story- of Speed Racer (Emile Hirsch) and his battles with the corrupt owner of Royalton motors (Roger Allam) with the help of Trixie, his girlfriend (Christina Ricci) and the mysterious masked Racer X (Matthew Fox), not to mention winning the big Grand Prix race- is told at times in such a jumbled way that one starts to loose the momentum built up in the race scenes. Even in the climax of the picture there's spouts of flashbacks that almost start to kill the adrenaline in the sequence. And, as is often to happen in kids movies, only here to the max, there's a detailing of the plot, twists that occur (I won't reveal which though they should be obvious), and some themes touched upon (redemption, revenge) that can barely be given enough weight given everything else that's going on.But this being said, there is enough to recommend in the picture overall for a rental; preferably widescreen for the full effect of the close-up visual scheme used constantly. When sticking to what probably made the series enjoyable, Speed Racer is good, not-quite old fashioned guilty pleasure. Actors like Allam (reprising a role somewhat from V For Vendetta) and Fox chew up their scenes especially well, and Hirsch is a solid choice for Speed. There's actually fun comic relief between Speed's younger brother and a chimp (including one impossibly laugh out loud moment where they fight monsters inside a bad anime TV show). And the races themselves are delirious imaginations, somewhere between the range of kung-fu and the pod race from Phantom Menace with a chase of amphetamines. They truly are some crazy works of pop-art, and for all the money (too much money) that went into the visual effects, they synthesize strangely for these races, either on the wintry slopes or in the wacky Grand Prix itself.What the brothers and the VFX crew were on when they created much of these scenes I can't say, and depending on the viewer they'll either delight one to hell or make on totally dizzy. For me, it's somewhere in the middle.",Speed Racer
8,BandSAboutMovies,Way better than I thought...,7,27 April 2019,"As a kid, I was totally obsessed with Japanese culture. In the late 1970's, we had Godzilla, Gamera, Johnny Sokko, Ultraman, Battle of the Planets, Starblazers and Speed Racer all on TV at the same time. The thing is, I was the older brother who always felt like the screw-up, so Racer X was my hero. I avoided this movie when it was released. How could it live up to my memories? I'm pleased t admit I was wrong. This movie is crazy in all the best ways.After years of this movie never getting made, The Wachowskis were able to bring it to the screen. Just from the beginning - where time overlaps and we get both the backstory of Speed, his brother Rex and the race that they've both won - this movie grabs you. Yes, it's way too CGI intense but at some point, all the blurring and spins and overlaps just win you over.Speed Racer (Emile Hirsch) loves racing and loves his family - Pops (John Goodman), Mom (Susan Sarandon), brother Spritle, chimp Chim Chim, his mechanic Sparky and his girlfriend Trixie (Christina Ricci) - even more. He once had a brother named Rex who left the family for racing and became one of the dirtiest racers in the sport before dying in the Casa Cristo 5000 cross country rally. Seriously, the flashback scene that tells you all of this will either thrill or exhaust you.Everything from the show is here, from how Speed leaps from the Mach 5 and the screen turns to pose in the original animation to characters like race fixer Cruncher Block, Inspector Detector, Snake Oiler and Prince Kabalah as well as the Mach 5, the Shooting Star, the GRX race car and the Mammoth Car.In a better world, the fact that this movie exists in a candy-colored neon world would have been seen as a welcome escape from the grim and gritty world that we live in. Sadly, it was not to be, although the film made up from its box office losses via merchandising and video sales.At one point, Julien Temple was to direct, Johnny Depp was to play Speed and Henry Rollins was going to be Racer X. I kinda wanna see that movie now.",Speed Racer
9,preppy-3,Going nowhere slowly,6,10 May 2008,"Live action update of the 1960s animated series. In this Speed Racer (Emile Hirsch) is a race car driver. He's trying to live up to his brother Rex who died in a car crash race. An evil corporation tries to buy Speed out but he refuses. So they decide to kill him in any race he's in.This has gotten vicious reviews from critics. To be honest they're pretty correct. There's no characterization of anyone, the script is by the numbers and the dialogue is so predictable it's groan worthy. But this film mostly concentrates on the visuals and, in that respect, it works. The visuals during the races are just incredible--you just sit there slack-jawed at what you're seeing. They're fast, loud and violent (BUT within a PG rating). Also the movie is extremely family friendly--it stresses a strong loving family that sticks together no matter what. And the mother is played by Susan Sarandon and the father by John Goodman. Who wouldn't want them as parents? Unfortunately we get the annoying younger brother Sprittle and his equally annoying chimpanzee pal Chim Chim! They're unfunny and drag the film down. But the kids in the audience I had loved them.Still the film has a plot so predictable it was insulting--I lost track at how many times I rolled my eyes over the dialogue. It makes the original cartoon look sophisticated. Also it's far too long. This film is over two hours with plenty of slow, boring sequences (mostly ones dealing with the plot). I looked at my watch quite a bit. Still-kids probably won't mind. There's no swearing, nudity or sex and the violence is all comic book level. The acting is terrible (except for Matthew Fox) but you can't blame the actors--they have nothing to work with.The kids will love it but probably not adults. I give it a 6 but that's just for the visuals. Adults will probably be bored silly. I'm an adult and I couldn't wait for this to get over.",Speed Racer
10,dbborroughs,I really was bored by the film and dislike it a great deal,2,10 May 2008,"They say if you can't say something nice don't say anything. Yea well...The performances are fine... I can't for the life of me say anything nice other than that, other than maybe its not quite as hyperactive as some have claimed. Unreal mix of live action and animation this is a perfect example of a visual wizards art. No doubt this film looks exactly the way the directors wanted it to be. The problem is that in throwing money at the visuals they forgot things like the ability to follow the races, excitement, a script. This is someone's idea of what speed racer is not what it really is. I grew up on the TV show and I recognized visual steals and the way that things were done in the cartoon, but where the cartoon had reasons for doing things they way they did, here they simply rip off the shots but have nothing behind them.The shots made you feel and moved the story, they didn't just look cool. They use the shots because they think it will play the same way, which it doesn't. Who did they make this for? Its not for adults. Its not really for women or girls. I think only young boys will like this since it will mirror an adolescent fantasy. Whats worse the film drones on and on and on and on.It never ends, it never builds to anything its either a scene of exposition or one of frantic visuals. I don't like it. I don't know what I would call it, its not a good film or a fair film or even an okay one, but its not ""bad"" in any classic sense. its dull and boring and way too hyperactive...then again maybe Bad sums it up.",Speed Racer
11,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Realistic expectations are key,7,23 March 2011,"Speed(no, really, that's his name... I guess his parents badly wanted him to pursue this career) is a kid who can't think of anything other than racing(which is cool, gravity-defying, thrilling, relatively plentiful and beautifully choreographed... and you genuinely care about the outcome(it's tense!), and it more or less manages to keep it grounded, with a lot of audience reactions). A corporate guy with a long tail and horns(well, he might as well have those) tells him that the sport is fixed, and tries to convince him to drive for him. When the former refuses, the latter wants to ruin him. Also, his brother died and it hurt the family. The dialog is poor(at times terrible), there are too many characters and most of them don't matter(including obnoxious, unfunny comic relief... and what kind of lousy kids movie doesn't have a monkey just to make sure any possible dignity is gone right off the bat?), the acting is over the top, it's all really obvious and the silliness(I think we should have a moment's silence for the collective dignity of Shaft and Sarandon) is rampant. I mean, it's almost as if this was a live-action adaptation of a Saturday morning cartoon! I have not watched the series itself, so I can't make comparisons(I can imagine fans might be disappointed... when isn't that the case? If you might be, stick with the animated original). This is heavily stylized, and for the visually stunning sequences, there are definitely also bits that hurt your eyes(so many colors...), and had I been in the editing room, I'd have brought a staff to whack the Wachowski's over the fingers when they reached for the ""irritating transitions"" button(were they *trying* to outdo Ang Lee's Hulk?). After a lot of time spent on exposition(and switching awkwardly and excessively confusingly(and not only for such a simple film) back and forth between past and present), this does get to be fun, with a highly entertaining last half. We get a little nifty martial arts, some chasing and shooting, and the pacing is surprisingly good. With that said, this is too long(at least two hours sans credits... are you kidding me?). And yes, it's a children's movie, still, why make so many of the villains so goofy? As someone who used to have only one digit to my age(long ago and far away), I can assure you, it's usually better when the bad guys are badasses(don't believe me? Look at what shows do better). Yes, this is like watching a video-game some of the time. Ricci is hot(why does the camera linger so little on her and the other chicks? You have to wonder if the crew were more into the piles of metal and gears on-screen). The DVD comes with two featurettes that I will review on their own pages here on the site(Supercharged and Spritle in the Big Leagues). There is brief strong language in this. I recommend this to anyone seeking something mindless and flashy. 7/10",Speed Racer
12,george.schmidt,The Wachowski Bros.' capture the anime classic's look but that's about it,7,13 May 2008,"SPEED RACER (2008) **1/2 Emile Hirsch, John Goodman, Susan Sarandon, Christina Ricci, Matthew Fox, Scott Porter, Kick Gurry, Paulie Litt, Roger Allam, Rain, Richard Roundtree. High-gloss treatment is given to the big-screen adaptation of the cult classic TV Anime cartoon from the '60s about the titular character (Hirsch in a decidedly one-note turn) whose quest to be the best auto racer since his late, beloved older brother catches the eye of bilious corporate hooligan (Allam, a poor-man's Tim Curry) involving a Grand Prix match that may cost more than his pride or family's loyalty: his life. Written and directed by The Wachowski Brothers the talented siblings use every ounce of cutting-edge technology to give the film a candy-colored hyper intensity that succeeds for the most part as far as the adrenalized visuals go, however the plotting is plodding and the film is too long to sustain any real interest in the matters at hand. But not a complete waste of time either since the duo do capture the spirit of the cartoon series with skillful élan.",Speed Racer
13,neil-476,Look at the bright pretty colours.....,3,27 May 2008,"This movie was a disappointment. I don't know if the Speed Racer cartoon was ever shown in the UK - if it was, I missed it. But the fact that I've never seen the TV series is, I think, a reason why I may not have all the data I need to assess this film comprehensively. Because I don't think I am within the demographic which this film is aimed at.Mind you, I'm not sure what that demographic is (other than middle-aged people who want to see the TV series translated into shiny new CGI - and that's an assumption on my part). One might think that the movie is a kids' film - it's full of bright shiny (bordering on fluorescent) colours, hyper-kinetic energy designed to appeal to the video game generation, and a simple-minded story. But then, and going with the story, there is much to put kids off - though simple-minded, I have my suspicions that kids aren't going to be too enthralled with the backstory of corporate corruption and, for a movie which runs over 2 hours (a long time for those restless little bums to stay on seats), there are several sections which are very very talky. I confess that I found it hard to stay awake through the main villain's attempted corruption of Speed.There was a fair bit to irritate unindoctrinated adults, too - the immensely shudder-making younger brother and pet chimp take the chequered flag in this particular race. And, while I understand that this movie takes place in its own universe - a universe in which the laws of physics as we know them don't quite apply - I found myself getting very distracted by the randomness and inconsistency with which they were applied. OK, so you can race round mountain bends at several hundred miles per hour, and come to an abrupt stop without being pulped. But how come that out of the many, many apocalyptic crashes, the only one which actually harms anyone is Rex Racer (OK, I know, I know, but in terms of the impact on other characters). My, how dangerous this racing is - well, not really, you just get cocooned in foam or parachuted to safety.I can't figure out the Wachowski brothers. Bound was a fabulous suspense thriller, wound tight as a watchspring. The Matrix was a groundbreaking sci-fi spectacular, with an interesting plot. V for Vendetta was a tolerable adaptation of a classic comic series.But Speed Racer is grown from the same seeds as the Matrix sequels. Yes, there's some fabulous eye candy in it. But I also need something for the brain to get its teeth into. Where the Matrix sequels went to an extreme of overblown pretentiousness, it's almost as if the Wachowskis have gone to the opposite end of the spectrum here just to make a point. And neither extreme works.Speed Racer was undeniably eye-catching, but I did not care about a single thing beneath the gaudy surface. Because there wasn't anything beneath that surface.",Speed Racer
14,evanston_dad,"Not a Great Movie, But the Blu-Ray Is Astounding!",5,30 January 2009,"If you own a Blu-Ray player, run don't walk to rent this movie and see Blu-Ray strut its stuff. This film looks AMAZING -- it's easily one of the most dazzling visual experiences I've ever had.However, do not misinterpret that praise as a recommendation of the film itself. Though it's not the disaster critics made it out to be upon its release, ""Speed Racer"" isn't a very good movie. If I hadn't been utterly absorbed in its high-def awesomeness, I likely would have gotten bored pretty quickly, as would I imagine anyone who's not under the age of, say, fourteen. Emile Hirsh is a drip as the eponymous hero, and there's not really anyone else in the cast to pick up the slack, though Christina Ricci tries mighty hard with the meagre material she's given to spice things up as Speed's girlfriend. The action scenes and much of the plot are frequently incomprehensible -- one wonders if a movie based on a cartoon needs to be quite so complicated, or quite so long (2+ hours). But if dazzling visuals are enough to engage your interest (and let's face it, sometimes they just are), then this one is worth the space on your Netflix queue.Grade: B-",Speed Racer
15,anaconda-40658,Speed Race to the Theatre Exit.,1,8 June 2015,"Speed Racer (2008): Dir: Andy Wachowski, Larry Wachowski / Cast: Emile Hirsch, Christina Ricci, John Goodman, Susan Sarandon, Matthew Fox: Special effects are the only praise worthy element here as colour bursts from all corners into what fails to be an exciting movie. Instead it is about as exciting as hitting a pot hole. The Wachowski brothers are all over the place. After his brother is killed in a racing accident Emile Hirsch rises the charts only to learn harsh realities. Andy and Larry Wachowski previously made Bound as well as the Matrix trilogy. They managed to become involved in different project but this one hits a road block without any brakes. Hirsch is the only casting that remotely propels as he steps in for his brother and becomes a target of a scheme. The rest of the cast don't fare quite so well. Christina Ricci plays his girlfriend and that is about the height of her importance in this film. John Goodman and Susan Sarandon as his parents are subdued in amongst the worst screen coverage of their entire careers. They are fine actors hindered by corny dialogue and complete idiocy. Matthew Fox is featured in a role that apparently Keanu Reeves was even smart enough to turn down. That should have been a hint to Fox. The film could have addressed fixed sports but instead it is merely a video game movie that deserves to be driven over by every car on the track. Score: 1 ½ / 10",Speed Racer
16,zetes,Pretty but empty,5,18 May 2008,"Certainly not the abject failure many critics seem to think it is, but it's certainly no success, either. I found the cartoonish world created by the Wachowskis and their three dozen special effects teams (seriously, the credits last half as long as the movie listing visual effects artists) constantly astounding and beautiful. I never got tired of looking at it (though I'd be willing to bet most would). Unfortunately, after the visual splendor, Speed Racer has little to offer. The characters are as thin, if not thinner, than they were in the original series. Susan Sarandon and John Goodman, the pros that they are, are both decent as Speed's parents, and Paulie Litt brings a lot of energy as Speed's youngest brother, Spritle. In fact, he has so much of that energy that the Wachowskis include him in every sequence. The rest of the cast is pretty lifeless, especially Emile Hirsch, who did quite well in Into the Wild last year, in the lead and Matthew Fox in the beyond thankless role of Racer X. It's almost worth it to Lost fans to see it for a scene where Fox gets in a fight with a ninja. I can't hate on Christina Ricci because she's way too hot as Trixie. The racing and fight scenes are decent action-wise, but it's occasionally difficult to tell what the heck is going on. The images move so fast that it's easy to miss who is who and what is what. The plot is like that, too. There were definitely bad guys whom I didn't really get. I just ended up assuming they all work for the big bad guy (Roger Allam) in some way. I have to admit that I was enjoying it most of the way through, but it's the kind of junk food that vanishes instantly. All in all, an empty experience.",Speed Racer
17,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Speed Racer,8,6 May 2008,"Go Speed Racer, Go Speed Racer, Go Speed Racer, Go!!!!!No, I'm not a hardcore speed racer fan. My only contact with the character and the cartoon series some 20 odd years ago, was from a couple of episodes from free-to-air television courtesy of Malaysia's RTM. Back then, since I did not understand Malay (which the series was dubbed into), I could only gawk at the wide eyed and often wide, moving mouths of the characters as they race around circuits in their cars, half the time not knowing what was going on, except to root for the kid in the white helmet emblazoned with a red M, and that kid could really drive (from those lines drawn across the screen), and had a really cool car christened the Mach 5.Now that I'm all, ahem, grown up, I still found myself rooting for that same kid in the same white helmet in the same car, albeit in a grown up version of the cartoon being put on screen. Gone are the dark and gloomy Matrix and Vendetta movies made by the Wachowski brothers Andy and Larry, and hello psychedelic colours that provide a visual sensory overload. From the trailer you would have seen the assault of neon and pastels, and not since Warren Beatty's Dick Tracy or Zhang Yimou's Hero had I seen colours being brought out with such maverick disregard. And guess what, it was one heck of a trippy ride, and fun.That's certainly one of the first things anyone coming out of the screening would attest to, the colours, and of course the visual effects. Like the Star Wars prequel gone totally wild, CG were extensively used to create new worlds, cities and interiors that I would like to raise my hand now and say The Jetsons could probably be made on a shoestring too. In fact, I thought the actors could probably be replaced by cartoons as well, but that would mean a waste of the charm that each of the cast brought to their roles, and wasn't it a hoot to see Rain in his first role in a Hollywood movie getting severely beaten?In any case, what shone in this movie, besides the races, were the characters, their interaction with one another, and what they stand for. No qualms about Emile Hirsch in the titular role, and I thought the entire Racer family was well cast, from Pops (John Goodman in yet another series-to-movie role after his Fred Flintstone stint), Mom (Susan Sarandon), mechanic Sparky (Kick Gurry), kid brother Sprittle (Paulie Litt) who provides most of the slapstick together with pet monkey Chimp Chimp, and hot loyal girlfriend Trixie (Christina Ricci). The villains of course were purely one dimensional, and like Iron Man, Corporations are once again the main baddie whose motivation of pure greed for money goes against the spirit of sports in this instance. While the action on four wheels were breathtaking, there were ample moments which put on the brakes and allowed for a breather or two in giving some characters a little more depth. And the Wachowski's still can't rid themselves of kung- fu, giving almost everyone some set action pieces where they get to exhibit some fisticuffs, even though they might look quite awkward executing the moves.But ah, the races. Straight out the cartoons, except with more realistic sound effects, and one for the fans - the retention of the specific effect when Speed activates the Mach 5's Auto Jacks. Pure pleasure to the ears, even though the visuals at times might be a blur with every car in ""Ultimate Extreme Drift Mode"" (TM by Stefan S) pulling off gravity-defying stunts consisting of never-ending-spins and drifts around tracks that don't stay still and resembling the zaniest roller coaster designs. What I liked about the narrative flow was how the races blend seamlessly with moments of drama thanks to creative editing, and of course, throwbacks to the animated series again with many a close up shots of drivers looking cool, or looking mean.What's the best way to enjoy Speed Racer? My take is to be in a high (I will put a disclaimer as to how you're gonna achieve this, is totally up to you). Should there be an IMAX version/screening of this, then it's a natural and appropriate movie to do so. Summer looks good again with Iron Man and Speed Racer holding up the fort. Let's hope the rest meets and excels expectations as well.",Speed Racer
18,Mr-Fusion,An eye-popping sugar rush,8,20 February 2015,"It may have died a commercial death, but ""Speed Racer"" is a thoroughly entertaining movie, and it was a highlight in a very rocky Summer movie season. This movie does a bang-up job with the racing scenes, which are invigorating, but it also keeps things moving during the quieter scenes (thanks mostly to its inventive visual style and family-centric story). I don't normally get into the rapid-fire insert shots of clutch-and-shift (I'm looking at you Fast and Furious movies), but it fits in with the rhythm of the scenes. Or it may be because this is a live-action cartoon. But either way, the action in this movie works.This is a great family movie with a winning cast (damn can Christina Ricci pull off that anime wig), candy-colored palette and supercharged driving. The races are nail-biting and have you cheering in all the right places. The good guys win, the bad guys get theirs and it's a lot of fun.8/10",Speed Racer
19,Smells_Like_Cheese,I felt like I was on Speed while watching this movie,5,11 May 2008,"Speed Racer, blockbuster number 2 for the summer, based off the popular animated 60's cartoon, the first real ""Japanimation"" series, we have the now live action film. What was supposed to also be a family film, this film just flops on. First I'll start on the positives: bright colors, exciting effects, and it felt like a cartoon, which is what it meant to bring. However, this movie was overly long, if it's supposed to be for kids, so don't make it into a 2 hour and 15 minute film. Like one of the ending scenes where Speed has all these flash backs of earlier scenes, we didn't need it. Some of the dialog, it was decent but again, could have been shortened. Also, I know that CGI is a thing that will never die, but it's not my cup of tea, because it just takes away something special. But the story does deliver on it's fast paced race scenes.Speed Racer has lived a fast paced life on the road, trying to live up to his ""deceased"" brother's world of racing. But all these sponsors are coming after him, but he wishes to stay in the family with his dad, mom, little brother, and Tricksey, his girlfriend. With the help of a mysterious Racer X, Speed wishes to beat the sponsors who threw things in his face and just make money off of him, and can just prove that he is the number one racer in the world.Speed Racer, for a summer blockbuster, it's a decent enough film, however it does have it's flaws here and there. Now the one thing I was impressed with is that not only did they make it feel like a cartoon, but it was over all pretty faithful the the original cartoon series, so you get a real feel of the original story. I just think it was a little too long and the CGI was a little too much, it was almost like why did they even need the actors? Everything was probably a green screen, so what's the point in making it with human actors? But this is a fun movie for the kids with the bright colors, it just could have been shorter, because the kids will probably loose attention with the film. But for the 10+ year old's, they'll definitely get into it.5/10",Speed Racer
20,Buddy-51,"Dazzling to look at, boring to watch",3,16 May 2012,"With its Candyland color scheme, video game graphics, and surrealistic backdrops, ""Speed Racer"" definitely has the look of an anime series come to life - not a surprise given that the same team responsible for ""The Matrix"" movies, the Wachowski brothers, served as the creative force here. Unfortunately, the cartoonishness extends to the characters as well, and that's where an adult audience quickly loses interest.This gruelingly long film - an absurd two-and-a-quarter hours - features Emile Hirsch as the title character who comes from a long line of racecar builders and drivers, including his father (John Goodman) and older brother (Scott Porter, of everlasting ""Friday Night Lights"" fame), the latter of whom may have had ties to some mighty shady characters and died under mysterious circumstances on a cross-country rally. Now Speed Racer is going to compete on the same course in the hopes of expunging the overwhelming corporate influence that is corrupting and destroying the sport.At least I think that's what the plot was about. For to tell you the truth, the time-shifting narrative is confused to the point of incoherence at times, and the villains are strictly from cartoon-ville in their over-the-top two-dimensionality. There's even a precocious kid brother and an annoying anthropomorphic chimp around to serve feebly as alleged comic cutups. And, worst of all, the race scenes themselves are so abstracted from reality that they fail to generate any tension or interest in the viewer. We never find anything or anybody to root for.Ultimately, ""Speed Racer"" leaves us with the question: how can something so impressive to look at be so boring to watch?",Speed Racer
21,cherold,Equally impressive and irksome,6,13 August 2017,"Speed Racer is filmed in a unique and imaginative way that at times is electrifying. Colors are vivid, action is wild, and information is dense but *usually* clear, notably in scenes where present action is seamlessly and simultaneously juxtaposed with flashbacks.It's impressive but often utterly exhausting. The movie starts in a mad adrenaline rush and just keeps pushing it. And a certain point I thought the action would never offer respite, and it would be two hours of flashy camera-work, elaborate green-screen setups, and explosions. But the time of the film's first quiet scene I was already mentally exhausted.All this tremendous bravura filmmaking exists more for itself than the story, which is trite and predictable. It is as though Martin Scorcese decided to use his considerable talents to make a My Little Pony movie.As a kid's movie, it's not bad. It's got annoying kids and monkeys and cartoonish bad guys and other things kids like. But it is pure sensory overload.",Speed Racer
22,g-bodyl,Very Disappointing!,3,12 November 2014,"Now as a fan of the Matrix trilogy and Cloud Atlas, I thought I would come to be a fan of the Wachowski Brother's Speed Racer. Unfortunately, this is not a really good movie. While the movie has good themes and a good source to work off of, the movie does not live up to it's potential. The story is weak and was not developed thoroughly, the visuals are headache-inducing and way too colorful, the acting wasn't that good, and this seems almost like an anime ripoff of the Fast and Furious series.The Wachowski's Brothers first film since 2003's The Matrix Reloaded/Revolutions is about a boy who dreams of racing in the Crucible, the race where his older brother died. Now Speed Racer follows in his brother's footsteps and while doing so, remains loyal to his family inducing the rage of the corporate Royalton Industries.The acting could have been so much better. For one, the kid who played the young Speed Racer is incredibly annoying and his dialogue was terrible. Emile Hirsch was better as the older Speed Racer, but it's a step down after his fantastic 2007 performances in Alpha Dog and Into the Wild. I normally love John Goodman and Susan Sarandon, but I really did not buy their performances.Overall, Speed Racer has so much potential but it fails to live up to them. This is the only blight on the Wachowski's resume as they would eventually redeem themselves with 2012's Cloud Atlas. It's a shame they produced such a weak movie here. The best part of the film would be the visuals, and even they are not that good. However, one cannot fault the ambition because they did try earnestly. I rate this film 3/10.",Speed Racer
23,ericstevenson,It at least tried,6,22 March 2018,"I admit to never having seen the original ""Speed Racer"" anime, but from what I heard, this is quite faithful to it. It's weird how that was an anime quite big for its day, but it seems like nowadays it's all but forgotten. We have tons of better mainstream anime now. Anyway, I think my favorite part of this movie was probably John Goodman as Pops. He really is a good actor. There's this odd twist near the end and I guess it's at least unexpected but doesn't make that much sense.I think this did well with fans of the show. I'm glad it wasn't something completely shameless like ""Dragonball: Evolution"". The worst part was probably how ridiculous the CGI looked. It seemed like it would have made more sense to just make this a full CGI animated movie. The plot seems to go everywhere but it does have some heartfelt scenes and awesome scenes. I've seen a lot of mediocre movies lately. **1/2",Speed Racer
24,cricketbat,Pure eye candy!,8,4 January 2020,"Pure eye candy! This film was bright, colorful, fast and fun. The story was simple, but what do you expect from a movie based on a 60s cartoon? This does not deserve the bad reputation it has.",Speed Racer
25,Rodrigo_Amaro,It Failed,2,3 May 2010,"""Speed Racer"" was a famous cartoon back in the 1960's and it's success made Hollywood had a great idea of transforming it into a feature film. A little too late I must say and badly executed. I have a few memories about the cartoon and I'm horrified with people saying that this film was 100% equal of its origin. Lie! Brothers Wachowski's film was a mix between ""The Fast and the Furious"" with ""Nascar Racer"" cartoon. Along with these two rip-off there is also a supposed to be funny family movie. Results? a poor attempting to obtain a great box-office.Here Speed (Emile Hirsch) is a young talented race car driver that participates of several races facing many obstacles, villains and funny situations. The rest of the plot is just like the cartoon with all the characters. John Goodman and Susan Sarandon plays Speed's parents. Matthew Fox plays the mysterious Racer X. And Christina Ricci plays Speed's love interest. Now, why this movie is almost a completely failure? First of all I have to say this. With five minutes of watching this I knew it I was going dislike it so much. The visual effects along with the fast editing ruined the whole experience, it looked like a crazy video game, and it was annoying seeing the characters's face passing on front of the screen every single time and in the background we have to see the scenery fade in and fade out transforming into another different thing. In short: The technique sucks! And when you think that this film was directed by the Wachowski Brothers the same guys that present us with ""Matrix"" trilogy you think where all the talent go? We'll never know!My biggest complain goes to the users of this site and for the people who actually liked this film giving 10 stars to it. If it is such a great movie why this was a flop? And don't dare say that critics ruined the movie chances with bad reviews because that, many times, don't mean a thing to a movie's reputation in box-office. ""Armaggedon"" was panned by many critics and it was a huge success (by the way ""Armaggedon"" is really a better movie than ""Speed Racer"" and that's a fact!). ""Speed Racer"" tried to be many things and failed in every single aspect. It tried to be a funny movie that you can watch with your family. Failed. I was sleeping in some parts close to the end (If Speed and the girl kissed in the end I don't know because I fell asleep very briefly and when I woke up the credits were rolling). I tried to be an adventure film with fantastic race scenes. Failed. It was supposed to have the most exciting scenes involving cars, explosions and dangerous moments but these moments were the weakest part of the movie, it wasn't exciting, it wasn't risky enough, it wasn't nothing at all.You may wonder why I'm giving 2 stars? Well, this movie wasn't a case of bad acting, the actors actually are quite good. Nothing that deserved an Academy Award nomination but it's still good. Sadly it's the first time I'm disapproving a Emile Hirsch's work although he's great here. But his other works are so much better than this. Roger Allan was terrific playing the villain who wants that Speed joins his team. But producers almost wasted Susan Sarandon here. She was better in movies such as ""The Client"" and ""Stepmom"" and producers could cast another actress for this bomb. I was seriously thinking in not watching any movies for a while after this disappointment.",Speed Racer
26,Rectangular_businessman,Boring and ugly film,1,14 June 2010,"I really don't see any point in making live action movies from cartoons. I liked very much the ""Speed Racer"" cartoon, but this wasn't nothing like the cartoon. It was closer to atrocious films as ""Spy Kids"" and ""Shark Boy and Lava Girl"" rather than the original ""Speed Racer"":-The visuals are terrible, mostly because of the CGI overload, as it was something directed by Robert Rodriguez.-The performances were terrible and the characters were boring and flat (This may sound strange, but I think that the characters were more realistically portrayed in the cartoon) -The story was muddled, bland and boring.Finally, I just want to say that this movie was so dumb and bad, just like all the live action movies inspired in cartoons.",Speed Racer
27,BaronBl00d,Visually Amazing with Stunning Colors,6,21 December 2008,"I never saw the Japanese animated series and went into Speed Racer as a pure novice. I also am not of a fan of racing. Notwithstanding I enjoyed the film as a piece of enjoyable entertainment as it chronicles the rise and grit of Speed Racer and the Racer family as they combat the evils of a world built on bribery, consumerism, and sponsorships. While much of the story's finer subtleties may have been lost on me, the film is very easy to understand. It's not Hamlet but is better than some of the mindless entertainment churned out these days in Hollywood. Part of the credit goes to the actors who give their roles enough attention to take them seriously for the most part. Emile Hirsch is fine in the title role. Matthew Fox is really rather good as Racer X. John Goodman gives an acceptable performance as Pops Racer and Susan Sarandon the same as the mom. I really enjoyed the performance of Roger Allam as the heavy. He could ooze with dialog with the best. The directors achieved more importantly a film that is visually stunning and stylistic in its own right. I didn't like all of the innovative things they did. The constant scenes overlapping became tiresome after awhile. But the races had a surrealistic look that made them oddly quite compelling. Speed Racer isn't trying to be taken too terribly serious. After all it is based on an animated series! But it does give the audience a lot of bang for its buck and captivated me the entire time. The biggest annoyance for me was the kid playing Spritle - I just didn't find him cute at all. Not one bit.",Speed Racer
28,FiendishDramaturgy,"Seems to be folded...great movie making, but there isn't much for the average movie goer...at least if they care that there is no meat beneath the grafixtravaganza",3,14 May 2008,"While any connoisseur of film will undoubtedly enjoy this eye candy smörgåsbord, the story telling (while creative and fresh) is lost amidst the vacant, spoon-fed, slack-jawed, no-brainery perpetrated upon the audience. The production style and camera work, digital effects, and ... well, eye candy is something to be beheld, however, there is something missing in the overall quality of the combined elements of the work. I can't say what that something is at the moment, but if it occurs to me, I'll be sure to edit this ""comment."" Some will say that this is the cutting edge of filmography, of filming style, of camera and production quality, and I'm afraid they may be right. But as a fan of cinema on the whole, I cannot say that I subscribe to the actual worth of these techniques, much less their necessity in the business.Oh yes, sure, the performances were A-list and the screenplay was A-quality, but this film is not about those elements of the process, as much as it is about the process itself. Does it entertain? The kids will like it. But it's just too wrapped around commerce for my tastes.It rates a 3.4/10 from...the Fiend :.",Speed Racer
29,hellraiser7,Fast Action Hero,10,30 December 2020,"This is one of my favorite films of all time as well as anime to live action adaptations. I'm a Speed Racer fan, I've seen the anime show when I was about eleven years old. Speed Racer to me is one of my favorite pulp heroes, on the list with Dick Tracy, Doc Savage, MacGyver, and Doctor Who. I always felt that this show could someday have a good live action film and thankfully my dream of that has finally came true.This film just has so much for it, it's really unique not just in being an anime live action adaptation but also being a family action film, which is something I rarely see in the action genre. But this is one of those ones done right in my book as it's not watered down which shows both the family and action genre like any well-built car can run right when put together right.The plotline is good for what it is, it's pretty straightforward as the format is the typical underdogs toppling tyrannical forces, good vs evil. But I like that, the fact that the plotline is simplistic and straight to the point is one of the strengths and that's mainly what all of the stories and plots in the show usually were; the story keeps itself on the right track there aren't any stupid twists or waste of space subplots so the film knows it's destination and where it wants to go. Also, in the old pulp action and adventure stories, they weren't totally concerned about the plot or deep drama but more on what the characters do during the adventure.The characters are all solid and well/rightfully casted. But also liked to give the characters an origin story which brought a little depth to them as well a little weight to the story. And help with the audience to know who's who as most viewers never grew up watching the show.Christina Rici is just perfect for the role of the live action Trixie. I always did picture that actress in the role and it was a dream come true. She both physically looks like her but also has a feisty persona to boot. Really like that she can kick some butt and hold her own against danger.Even like we get a little depth on Speed and Trixie's relationship, there's a flashback on how we see both have met which I thought was cute and sweet, really liked seeing how she decks the snobby girl who was talking trash about Speed. It shows that she's a person that doesn't take crap from anyone nor let anyone else that close to her take it; that I can emphasize with as I'm a person that also doesn't take crap. Anyway, in this flashback is of course the time both Speed and Trixie first meet and fall in love.Mathew Fox is also perfect for the role of Rex Racer/Racer X. Really like how the Matt nails the mysterious, straight edged bad ass persona. Just seeing him play this role, would have been interesting if this actor got to play Batman, that would have been something. As usual Racer X is the guardian angel like character looking out for his brother Speed and his family in any kind of trouble.John Goodman is great as Pops Racer. He's got that tough gruffness but warmth underneath it. He's devoted to his business in building cars but also to protecting and providing the best for his family.But of course, my main man Speed played well by underrated actor Emile Hirsch. Emile was just perfect in the role of Speed as he not just physically looks like the character but he is the character; just as Christopher Reeve is ""Superman"", Peter Weller is ""Robocop"", Carl Urban is ""Judge Dredd"". As a fan of Speed Racer, I just thought it was always so cool seeing a race car diver as an action hero at the same time, it really is an awesome and clever concept because it's seeing and having two genres both sports and action working together and both make a good combo.Speed has some charisma, but I like that in this film he's not some straight up action hero immediately nor does he have the desire to be one. But just an ordinary person that wants to work and live his dream of being the best at doing one of the things he does best in life racing but also simply to do the right thing. I like that because it makes him more human and really hero/superheroes are human at their core.Even like the chemistry he has with characters, though my favorite is with his girl Trixie. Both Speed and Trixie are my honorable mention in favorite fictional couples as both you could say sort of predate other fictional couples from TV shows like ""Remington Steele"" and ""Castle"". Really bought into both being a long-time couple but also both supporting each other emotionally to the races and life and death situations, which I feel is part of what people in a good relationship should do.However, like in the original show were all in it for the action and adventure. This film is style overtopping substance as this film has more color than the film ""Sin City"" and the TV show ""Miami Vice""; it is just a buffet of sights that will take more than one watch to eat it all up. I really like how the whole film takes place in sort of an alternate world where it's sort of this colorful fascinating mix of eras, from the 1960's which makes sense as that's when the anime series was on. But we see a lot of modern and even futuristic technology along with fashions.However it's those cars and race tracks I really like, those tracks are just awesome, their similar to the race tracks from the video game series ""F-Zero"" and ""Wipeout"", seeing this film shows a live action movie based on those games is possible. Their both colorful and crazy as they just twist, turn, bob and weave, this makes the racing scenes more interesting because of the unpredictable nature of those tracks, you just never truly know what's up ahead. The cars are also cool as their all have their unique styles, even like they have different kind of weapons much like in the ""Mario Kart"" video games, which adds to the racing scenes making them also a dog fight.The music is excellent as it's done by Michel Giacchino whom is an honorable mention in my favorite music composers. All the scores all hit in the right spot and sound just right as it feels like you really are watching the TV show again. Three of my favorite tracks are the two versions of the end theme track from the one from the movie but another which sound like the one from the original show. Of course my number one favorite is the one in the final race the Grand Prix, that track is just awesome it just pumps you up for fast action and just makes you feel like your behind the wheel racing for your life.The action is great you do see some fist a cuff action, like seeing Pops putting the hurt on with his wrestling moves on the bad guys which was both cool and funny as he's got some super strength.Of course, it's the racing sequences that are the best. Cinematography is spot on capturing and following the action well, you really feel like your part of the action and that you're in that Mach 5 and steering it toward the track of glory. I couldn't help but move in my seat or pretend I'm steering the wheel struggling to zip past and blow away the competition before tie competition blows Speed away.I just love seeing Speed in the Mach 5 in its glorious beauty, the Mach 5 is one of my favorite fictional cars, whenever I saw the show when I was a kid and seeing that baby in action, I wanted to drive it. We see in the film it's armed with all of its gadgets we know and love for anyone that's ever seen the show, of course we see him use them all well. My favorite of course are the jack jumpers, really like the physics in the jumps but most importantly hearing them which is just music to my ears.Speed Racer is a fast action film that is up to speed. And remember ""Go Speed Racer Go!""Rating: 4 stars",Speed Racer
30,elshikh4,Not even sunglasses can make this movie watchable !,1,31 October 2011,"""MY EYES, MY EYES, AHHHHHH!"" This was pretty much my condition since the movie's half. And after its end I, swear to god, had trouble seeing normally for a good deal of time!True that some points bug in the Wachowski brothers' script (long, why the older brother didn't tell the truth to his family? How come that his parents didn't feel him ""in here, man feels only cars!""). But overall I loved it, seeing that it could have been some blockbuster anyway. The thing is the Wachowskis, as in Pygmalion, made something beautiful then destroyed it by their own hands.Did anybody ever worked in this movie tell Andy & Larry anytime before the release: ""Hey, isn't that too much.. a bit?!"". Somehow, (Speed Racer) assures that those 2 can be dumb and egomaniac too. It fits as a study in how wrong color, close-up, CGI, and editing can go sometimes. And seriously, that is where its real addition remains.Visually, it's a mess of non-stop extremely flashy colors. There are no less than 2000 red, pink, blue, green, white, yellow pertinacious punches pointed straight to your eyes. Exorbitant exaggeration is what this movie considers as usual. In brief, this is varicolored inferno. I pitied the editor of it, and the ones who were unlucky enough to watch it at the theaters, they both lived hell on earth literally!The whole thing is shot mostly in close-ups. That was visually boring, and idiot, in terms of directing, and none other than a childish attempt to imitate the anime' technique. So with too many, too close, close ups inordinately; I felt like many people are talking in my mouth! Let alone the matter of using a moving close-ups interlacing together, as if a waltz, ALL THE TIME. While being cool in any anime, it was overused to cause such a long laugh sometimes!The CGI looked endless, fake and painful. If creating a video game's image precisely was the goal, why not producing it as one from the start?! And when it comes to the CG back projections, it's a precedent as ugly!The editing was merciless. The movie needed just that choppy cutting to attain a complete Razzie condition. It ruined everything, from losing many points in the already plain plot, to mastering making hyped cotton-candy monster. As you see, it's closer to Frankenstein more than Pygmalion!So with this professionally poisonous mix; the action becomes senseless, the enthusiasm for anything turns into impatience towards provocative long joke, and the experiment of watching oversteps the mark of ""bad"" to the rare mark of ""incredibly bad"". Here's the reason why this movie will join an exclusive league of seen-to-be-believed awful movies, where (Armageddon - 1998) would look to (Speed Racer), smile ironically saying: ""..And they used to call me eye-exhausting hurly-burly, huh?!"".Save Emile Hirsch's always sprayed hair, nothing he has was bearable. He seemed like a cold smiling robot that says his lines and that's it. Any cartoon character has more energy than his. Christina Ricci was creepy more than cute; quite like the movie itself! Btw, if you can forget her stupid wig, then you're lucky. So lucky!Good points? The monkey. He was better actor than the lead, no doubt about that. Paulie Litt, as Spritle, if only it was all about him and the monkey. Goodman, despite the overweight, the matter of being an ex-ninja, and the condition of his left eye. Matthew Fox proved that an actor with just nose, mouth, and voice still can make a character. Most of the script, for being ardently anti-capitalist, and for its craftsmanship; review the first sequence with presenting every character's point, in past and present, through a race sequence. And the ultimate good point: I haven't watched it in a theater. Ahhh.. Thank God for this.I won't say it defines extravagance; it's rather a nuclear bomb of extravagance. (Speed Racer) is the cinematic overkill at its worst. Not even sunglasses can make it less terrible. Christina Ricci said about it: ""It gives such a euphoric feel."" (it was in a promoting interview, so don't panic!). From where I'm standing, it gives such a hateful feel, because it pushed me to hate it, hate the Japanese cartoon, which I didn't have the opportunity to watch it yet, hate the Wachowski brothers, and whoever saw something wrong in their work - while doing it - and didn't say a word, hate car racing, cars, and the world!!!Finally, 2 messages. To the Wachowski brothers: There is a difference between ""to enjoy"" and ""to excruciate"", and your movie is a pretty good lesson, and why not passing out the same script earlier to the Japanese people to make it as a cartoon?! WHYYYY! And to its producers: you've paid $120,000,000, to earn $93,945,766.

Starring Emile Hirsch(Into The Wild, The Girl Next Door) in the title role has 20 year old Speed Racer who hopes to the best race car driver around, and also to get rid of the shame that was brought on his family since the death of his older brother Rex(Scott Porter). With the support of his Mom and Dad(John Goodman and Susan Sarandon), but then things get really crazy, when the corrupt world of racing try to take hold of Speed, will he defeat them or sell out? An enjoyable action film for kids and adults. And well directed by the Wachowski brothers, they really know how to make there films entertaining, and being on the edge of your seat, like they did with The Matrix series. Matthew Fox is also good as Racer X.",Speed Racer
32,freemantle_uk,A style over substance film,4,23 May 2010,"After the success of the Matrix Trilogy the Wachowski brothers decided that their directional would be Speed Racer, an adaptation of the 60s Japanese Anime series. This was a project that was being kicked around a lot in Hollywood before the Walchowskis got involved and the two aimed to make their first family friendly film.Speed Racer (Emile Hirsch) is as his name suggests a racing driver who has a very first style of driving. He idealised his other brother Rex (Scott Porter) who died in a race after his name was discredited. Speed starts to prove himself as a racer, driving for his father's (John Goodman) team and he is quickly wanted by E.P. Arnold Royalton (Roger Allam), a major industrialist, to drive for his team. Speed is tempted by the offer but rejects it: Royalton sets out to destroys the Racer family's reputation, both publicly and financially. Speed get an offer from the police to help them in their investigation, to work with two other drivers: Racer X (Matthew Fox) and Taejo Togokahn (Rain) to take down Royalton and the cartel that runs the racing work.The Wackowskis have made no secret that they are fans of anime, Akira is one of their favourite films and was influence of The Matrix. Speed Racer itself was one of the first anime shows that was big outside Japan and started a trend of Westernising characters in Japanese cartoons. I personally remember seeing an updated version in the 90s which I enjoyed at the time. Many big name directors, actors and writers were attached to the project like Alfonso Cuarón, Gus Van Sant, J. J. Abrams, Johnny Depp and Vince Vaughn before the Wackowskis got involved. Whilst the Wackowskis are obviously passionate filmmakers, with The Matrix being one of the best sci-fi films made in the last 15 years, they had been torching their careers ever since, giving audiences the dubs of the Matrix sequels. They have sadly been unable to re-capture that magic that made them hot property in Hollywood. Whilst there are some decent action scenes actions scenes, like fights and some of the racing scenes, but this is nothing to their early work. Some of the other actions scenes were not so good because the action was too fast for the camera to catch and the whole point should have been to capture every moment possible. The Wackowskis were also too reliant on CGI, and not very good CGI. It could be argued that the Wackowskis were trying to give the film a cartoon feel, but it really did not work and the film looked to fake. It would have been better as a cartoon. Plot wise the film goes the wrong way: the film focus too much on the idea of corporate corruption and it should have been more on the idea of simple race fixing. A young audience is not going to be too interested in corporate corruption until they are older. The film is also too long, being over 2 hours long. This type of film should really have a running time of about 1 hour 45 minutes, give or take a few minutes. The Wackowskis attempted to make a live action cartoon: but what may work in a cartoon like the designs of cars and weapons do not work so well in film. The Wackowskis approach of direction was style over substance, with the directors focusing on camera tricks like swapping views between cars and letting people speaking sliding across the foreground whilst the action is going on behind them.The actors did not have much to do. Roger Allam offered a good performance as the slimy villain of the piece, but everyone else did not have much to do. Casting Susan Sarandon was pointless seeing she did not have much to do, whilst many other actors just had to keep a straight face with some of the dialogue they had to say. The character of Spritle (Paulie Litt) was one of the most annoying characters put to film recently. He was just a fat kid who acted stupid throughout the film with his pet chimp. They comic antics may have worked in a cartoon but it was horrid in a live action film and he was a highly unlikeable character. The character should have been cut or re-written.Finally they were reports of animal cruelty on the set of Speed Racer which is never forgivable.A fairly forgettable film.",Speed Racer
33,strong-122-478885,Brotherly Love & Blood Is Thicker Than Motor Oil,5,28 June 2014,"In spite of being flawed by its weak & clumsy ""Wachowski""-style directorial blunders (Was Speed Racer really just a hasty re-tooling of The Matrix?), this Action Film certainly did deliver an adrenaline-rush when it came to the sheer extravagance of its high-powered, pop art, CG visuals.But regardless of its impressive, rapid-fire editing, its wild & imaginative camera-work, and its vividly bold, rainbow-colored imagery (which was a really delightful feast for the eyes), Speed Racer's story unfortunately did not hold up well, at all, for the ultimate test - A second viewing. No, it didn't.As I disappointedly found out the second time around, Speed Racer only came to life during the dazzling scenes on the racetrack. And that was it. The remainder of this needlessly overlong film was just a flat and painfully uninspired pile of family-oriented nonsense that (I guess) was supposed to tug on my heartstrings.And so, I ask you - At this point in my review, how can I possibly be expected to heap a load of praise on a film whose most interesting & charming character was that of a mischievous, hyper-active, little chimpanzee named Chim-Chim who deserved a helluva a lot more screen-time than he got? And finally - I, for one, sure frickin' wish that trans-sexual/writer/director, Lana Wachowski would stop riding the goddamn fence when it comes to this whole business of her recognition in the film credits.OK. Fine. As we all know full well he/she has long ago lost her wiener by the quick flick of the surgeon's scalpel - So, like, when is this ""Written & Directed by The Wachowski Brothers-stuff"" gonna stop? Eh? When? Like, aren't the Wachowski's officially now a brother and sister team?",Speed Racer
34,PWNYCNY,Entertaining cartoon-like movie.,8,17 May 2008,"It would be easy to trash this movie, to mock its simplistic plot, to deride its flashy use of special effects, to laugh at its childish format, to question whether this movie is actually a cartoon, but this movie is actually good. It's imaginative, action-packed and has a unique style. It's not pretentious; its comic book-like design adds to the movie's watchability and makes it a much purer form of entertainment. This movie is like a live-action cartoon that uses the theme of capitalistic greed and corruption to create the basis for a story with a well-defined set of villains and heroes. At first one might wonder if this movie is a cartoon interspersed with some live-action footage but as the movie proceeds and the story develops the movie's creators succeed in putting aside the pretentious in favor of some unabashed fun.

35,drqshadow-reviews,A Dizzying Swirl of Neon Lights and Motion Blur... I Need to Lie Down,2,24 September 2018,"The Wachowskis pull out every green screen trick in the book for this glowing block of candy-colored nostalgia, draped in the wallpaper of a classic '60s anime. The whole thing functions more like an experiment than a film, a proof of concept gone bad, staffed by several well-regarded stars, that somehow grinds on for 135 minutes. It's like sharing a daydream with a hyperactive six-year-old on a sugar rush. There's so much going on at any given time, so many violent splashes of jagged colors and wildly animated background details, that a complete viewing can feel downright exhausting.The tech doesn't even appear to be there yet, either; the whole mess comes off as clumsy and awkward, a mismatched wreck that conflicts and clashes with itself. One post-race attempt to recreate Speed's fluid leap from his moving race car, landing right in a dynamic signature pose (a staple of the old cartoon's title sequence), is so corny and improbable I couldn't help bursting into laughter. An utterly baffling film that deserves every bit of infamy it's accumulated. How did they pull this off with a straight face?",Speed Racer
36,XweAponX,Just cos it was The Wachowski Brothers,10,3 January 2012,"This film was hated and Baited, Berated and people were Jaded - Just because it was a Wachowski film. Like ""V for Vendetta"" before it, this film was highly panned, although it is a high quality romp.There is NOTHING wrong with either This Film or The Wachowski Brothers, Or Wachowski Siblings, if you want to consider their new sexual status.These two (ehem) guys stood the world on its ear for The Matrix. And they tried hard to build that into a multi-medium storyline, which consisted of three live action films, a set of animated stories, and a User-Created Milieu ""The Matrix Online"" - THESE achievements, sound more like Successes than Failures.And so this 2008 Live Action attempt at Speed Racer, for all intents and purposes WAS Speed Racer. Not only that, the Wachowskis had more firsts. This was the first film which used the Camera system used. Computer Technology was vastly improved and the Digital Elements of the film blend seamlessly to make a fantasy film - This film has great magnitude for what it is.And, it brings to life beloved characters from the Cartoon series- And Does so in an Authentic Way: John Goodman IS ""Pops"" - The Kid who plays ""Spritle,"" Paulie Litt - Looks and Sounds just like the kid from the Toons. Racer X looks like Racer X, and the Mach 5 IS the Mach 5, even though it was the only non digital racer in the production. Susan Sarandon actually looks well here, and she is still a top notch Character Actress.Needless to say, I have just about ALL of the Hotwheels Mach 5's and Racer X's cars that were made when this movie came out-With all of the attachments. I even bought dupes so I could play with them. Actually it was the Hotwheels release of the Mach 5 cars that got me started collecting Hotwheels again.The way the Mach 5 and Racer X's car behave in this film is exactly how they acted in the Toons.So I rate this a 10 even though I only get 5 stars... Oh, I guess I DO get 10 stars.The announcers for the various countries and companies are hilarious. There is a lot of great stuff in this. Plus it is a great Kid's film. For big kids and little kids.John Goodman has a great scene where he beats the total crap out of a Ninja (Or, as Goodman says, ""Non-ja""), and THAT's all the spoiling you will get from me!",Speed Racer
37,MaxBorg89,"Ready, steady... Stop right there!",5,12 May 2008,"""I feel the need... the need for speed!"". That was Tom Cruise in 1986, hitting international stardom in Top Gun. 22 years later, it isn't very likely anyone besides the Wachowski brothers feels the need for Speed Racer, the director duo's attempt at a kid-oriented action movie. To call it silly is perhaps a compliment; to say it's so flaccid at times it makes the underwhelming Matrix sequels look like Terminator 2 is closer to the point.With the Matrix, Andy and Larry Wachowski wanted to do a live-action version of a Japanes anime. In that sense, Speed Racer is way ahead of their masterpiece, as it is actually based on an anime series known as Go Go 5. Then again, it is quite clear this isn't the usual Yank actioner anyway: not even Michael Bay in his pre-Transformers days would have come up with a family where one of the younger siblings is a monkey. The screenplay, of course, does nothing to explain that oddity, preferring to show how said monkey is just like Mom (Susan Sarandon), Dad (John Goodman) and the other brothers: racing cars is all they care for in life, with the old man being a mechanic and young Speed (Emile Hirsch) promising to become a damn good driver, maybe even good enough to get out of his late brother Rex's shadow. The manipulative Mr. Royalton (Roger Allam) certainly seems to think so at first; but when Speed turns down his collaboration offer, the cynical businessman unveils a new world, dominated by money, where regular people like the boy's folks will be crushed. Cue a mysterious helper (Racer X, played by Lost's Matthew Fox) and the good old fight against evil, all over again.Perhaps anticipating script-related criticisms, the trailers wisely focused more on the entirely computer-generated setting than on the characters, hoping the style would cover any substance holes. It doesn't, partly because the blatantly fake universe in which the film takes place isn't that much of a visual treat as one was hoping for, racing tracks notwithstanding, but mostly because the story is so devoid of interest even the target audience might find it boring. As for the adults taking their kids to see the film, they better not expect any decent acting: Goodman and Sarandon are wasting their time trying to find the humanity in flat roles, Christina Ricci is equally stiff as Speed's love interest, while Hirsch, so astounding in Into the Wild, is lifeless to the point that Keanu Reeves' work in The Matrix Reloaded reminds of Marlon Brando in comparison. Allam does at least try to give that British edge to his duff villain, but makes the mistake of being too obviously evil, lacking the subtlety of other great Englishmen like Christopher Lee or Alan Rickman. Only Matthew Fox is capable of delivering an acceptably enjoyable performance, using the few developable traits of his character, and he is also the only cast-member to bring some energy the action scenes, which are otherwise sterile or, even worse, beyond cartoonish. Directing a kids' film is one thing, directing it like a kid is completely different.In all fairness, though, the Wachowskis do pull off at least one thing that should satisfy the little ones: Fox aside, the best thing in Speed Racer is the freaking monkey.

38,myriamlenys,watch it for the visuals,5,17 May 2020,"""Speed Racer"" tells the story of a bold young man who is a supremely capable racer. All he wants to do is to win races, in order to honour the memory of his late brother and in order to support his parents. Sadly, it turns out that the world of international racing is beset by evils such as greed, dishonesty and corruption...To begin with the good, this movie boasts a very striking look. The colours dance, glow, pop, sizzle : blue is supremely blue, red is emphatically red, green is uniquely green. The set pieces, especially with regard to the racing scenes, fairly leap from the screen, thanks to a lively visual imagination allied to copious amounts of computer-generated effects. In other words, the visuals are stunning.In this regard, watching the movie is pretty much the equivalent of attending a fire work display over the most colourful section of Las Vegas. Sadly enough the tale being told isn't anything to write home about, on the contrary. If the visuals move with the imperious speed of a top-quality racing car, the story is like a sad little heap of road-kill. Now one can be kind and say that a family film, or even a children's film, is not the right vehicle for subtle tales, intelligent parables or multi-faceted characterizations. Still, ""Speed Racer"" doesn't even try. Most viewers will be able to come up with a more competent alternative simply by giving the matter some thought during a nice long shower.The poor actors did their best, but one gets the impression that they knew they were about to play second fiddle to the dazzling effects. So that's yet another fine cast wasted.Finally : are there still people, anno 2008, who think that the inclusion of a chimpanzee will provide lighthearted comic relief ?",Speed Racer

I wish I watched it as a kid because I would've loved this movie so much more. The world in Speed Racer is so cartoonish and I love it! The colors have never been brighter, it feels like a weird trip especially the last race. I love how they haven't changed much from the show, every car detail and weapon is unchanged. The villain here is maybe too cartoonish for me and didn't have much depth, I would prefer more development in that area like the show did. Most acting was fine, only the kid with chimp was an awful choice, he was so annoying. We need a sequel to this but yeah it unfortunately won't happen.",Speed Racer

He just about steals all the scenes he is in, he plays the younger brother,Be sure to stay for the extras, as this little ham,takes us on a tour of a very interesting behind the scenes tour. The lad has comic talent & I wish him luck.The movie is long,BUT the 135 minute length does go by at a nice brisk rate.Take my advice here, forget the seriousness of the world outside, sit back and enjoy the cartoon-like fun of this movie.Ratings:*** (out of 4) 83 points (out of 100) IMDb 7 (out of 10)",Speed Racer
41,ShootingShark,Agreeable And Visually Dazzling Comic Book Yarn Of Hotshot Young Racecar Driver,6,1 September 2009,"Speed Racer is a hotshot young driver with a superfast car, the Mach 5. When he wins an important race, he is courted by industrial giant Royalton to drive for them. Should he sign this lucrative big business contract, or remain in his small independent family team ?I like this film a lot since a) it's about racing cars, b) it's stuffed full of amazing visual effects (by John Gaeta and Dan Glass), and c) it has an incredible design style, and I'm a big fan of all of these things. It goes for an ambitious look that blurs the differences between live action and animation, and it succeeds fantastically well as the ultra bright colours leap off the screen at you. Other movies have tried this before (Dick Tracy, The Flintstones, much of Ralph Bakshi's stuff) but due to the sheer volume of CGI work and digital film shooting this surpasses those technically, and because it feels much more like a kids' cartoon it also scores over contemporary flicks like Sin City or 300. The style does have good points and bad points however; the cars squeal around the tracks, spinning, jumping and hurtling by, and the camera rushes everywhere, zooming between drivers as they talk rather than cutting around them, but the action is frequently so fast that it's impossible to figure out what exactly just happened. The story is also confusing at times, particularly in the first half-hour, where flashbacks are cut both against and directly into the narrative. I guess my main complaint is that the movie could be a bit more focused - it's quite clearly for kids (it has a funny extended scene where a boy and a chimp go on a chocolate-fuelled crime spree), but kids really need a simple, clear story and too often the movie bogs down into complexity and heavy scenes. The cast play it well, old-fashioned good guys and bad guys style. The design elements are just fantastic, with almost every scene featuring amazing backgrounds, vibrant red-blue-yellow-green colours, and wild looking cars and racetracks. Based closely on a sixties Japanese cartoon series, Mahha GoGoGo, by Tatsuo Yoshida, with much of the look and feel from the original show. Produced by Joel Silver, and shot at the famous Studio Babelsberg in Potsdam, this is a boundary-pushing, eye-popping, action-packed, fun flick. Go, Speed Racer, go !",Speed Racer
42,TheOneThatYouWanted,Better than popular opinion,9,12 August 2017,"Speed racer I'm not sure why people hate this movie so much and I'm not going to waste my time reading their reviews to find out why. If I had to guess, I would say the hate stems from people going into this movie expecting to watch a Matrix like movie because this was the first film the directors filmed after. Whatever, it is campy but also serious at other times. The acting is okay but the action is amazing. It is cool neo-retro racer action. Only if they waited 5 to 10 years for the special effects to totally catch up with what they where trying to do. Regardless, this film is entertaining and that is all that matters.",Speed Racer
43,onepotato2,Slow Speed Racer... sloooooooow,2,30 September 2008,"Making a movie out of speed racer is a problematic idea. The plot of the entire run of the show could be summed up in two sentences, three if you were extremely poor with language. But the movie is bad in so many ways. For starters the creative team has come up with only a texture, not a movie, and certainly not a story. It certainly has a unique, odd look, but it has no pacing and holds very little interest. One visual gimmick is used ad nauseum; countless actors heads pass across the screen and reveal a different clip as they slide by. This happens about eleven hundred times. The filmmakers don't get basics like story and useful contrasts i.e. when Speed's car can do such synthetic things constantly (traveling sideways, inverting, bouncing around like a bar of steel) nothing is ""special"" or particularly vivid.Who on earth thought that every minute of it's 135-minute running time was to be treated like a piece of the true cross? Take these Hollywood execs outdoors and shoot them. At least an hour of this endlessly repetitive movie is disposable. Two Hours! For God's sake, why?This movie is the same crappy film that was promised by Coppola's One from the Heart, a movie you haven't heard of and will never see. OFTH is the original pile-up that started this whole, regrettable digital revolution, using few physical sets, replaced via green-screen technique, and furiously overworked computers. No one wanted to see that either. Likewise, it had no story.But a lightbulb did turn on in my head as I watched this. Remember in the Speed Racer cartoon at the beginning of each episode... wearing a blue shirt, Speed would drive the Mach 5 onto a black and white checkerboard, extend one leg out of the car and the animation suggested a camera moving 90 degrees around the subject suspended in time? Guess where the Wachowskis took their clever ""frozen camera rotation"" trick in the Matrix from. They were riffing on Speed Racer. If that shot was replicated here, I didn't see it. Probably because the Matrix would seem less clever with the source of it's big idea unveiled.Speed Racer is a bloated, digital jalopy.",Speed Racer
44,Blueghost,Awful,1,29 September 2013,"Just plain awful. This is another mental health ""be positive and true to yourself"" film wrapped up in some of the worst cinematic story telling I've ever seen in my entire life.In essence the director repeated that visual stylings of a pseudo anime live action film style that's prevalent in Japan, where a popular piece of animation (Anime) is duplicated in live action form; complete with zany and wacky inserts, slow-mo shots, and just plain crazy cinematography that's off the wall.I can only assume the director over-estimated the audience's taste in thinking that we, anime fans, and aficionados of this particular anime (""Speed Racer"", a.k.a. ""Mach a Go Go"" in Japanese) were familiar with, loved and enjoyed all anime, and translations thereof.Er...no.Fans of Anime, at one time usually young males, enjoyed Anime because it showed action and violence in a ""grown up"" or adventure like fashion. It was gunplay, it was action, it was violence, is was high drama animation that you didn't even get in the best Disney offerings because American studios treated their audiences like little two year old boys and girls. If you're little boy can read ""Treasure Island"" or ""The Hobbit"", then he can probably understand Japan's offerings in the form of shows like the ""Speed Racer"" cartoons.This film was just a mess from start to finish. Aficionados of the original cartoon who were hoping for a well grounded live action update of a show they remembered from their youth, were in for a let down, as the haphazard and often Zany deliver of the story reels the imagination.Me, I saw the DVD in the bargain bin at some big box store, and splurged a couple dollars for what I thought might be a night's entertainment. Wow. Never again.If I had shot it, I would not have taken the liberties that Andy and Lana Wachowski had. I would simply told a Speed Racer story. Or, better yet, I might have just turned it into a pure CGI feature, but with a conventional grounded story, instead of the condescending ""high art"" concept that these two slop-artists heaped on the masses.To the husband-wife director team; stick with making matrix movies, and keep your overweight grubby fat-finger mitts off of beloved properties like ""Speed Racer"".",Speed Racer

46,RainDogJr,Go go Go Speed Racer go Go Go Speed Racer go Go Go Speed Racer go Go Go Speed Racer go Go...Speed Racer B. Goode,9,10 May 2008,"Even if you are not familiar with the original TV show, like me, you must know something about this classic Japanese anime. In my case I'm a big fan of the fantastic Mach 5, definitely one of my favourite cars of a TV show or a movie. So apart of my Mach 5 1/64 die cast car of Johnny Lightning, a bigger scale model of the same car and my action figures of Speed Racer, Spritle and Chim Chim that I own since I was very young, I have no other stuff of Speed Racer. Even that I'm not a fan definitely I had some expectations of this movie, of course mostly for ""The Matrix"", and when I looked the trailer it was so damn colorful and totally different of the original show.The plot introduces Speed Racer (Emile Hirsch) as a young boy whose only interest are the car races. Is not rare since his family dedicate all of their lives to this sport. His father (John Goodman) runs their little business and his brother (Scott Porter) is a great racer. With the narrative style of the film we are watching this and at the same time we are watching the present days of Speed Racer, now as the new sensation of the car races. The story of the film is quite simple having the classic new and talented sportsman, who really feels a passion for what he do, entering in the professional ambit where the business comes always first and the money is the principal ""talent"". Of course there is a message and the hopes that the racing sport could be an honest sport with only winners that really deserves that honor.The plot is nothing new but still I really like it. But definitely the visuals are just great making the film sometimes a live action comic book, a surrealistic child adventure, overall whatever the Wachowski brothers wanted, I think, is here. For example sometimes the car races looks like everything you want except a car race and that looks really good of course with all the colors that are really unusual. But definitely my favourite visuals are the ones when is a total live action comic book; the scene of the fight in the mountains, during the Casa Cristo rally, is so damn great. In resume I love the visual part of the film.The cast is good with many funny moments and a cartoon look, of course the are is not a magnificent performance that stand out the others but everybody seems with the correct role. I think Emile Hirsch was a good choice as Speed Racer and John Goodman looks really funny and quite different. He is no more Fred Flintstone. Ricci looks also quite different but still very beautiful as Trixie . The support cast is just good with Paulie Litt as Spritle and Susan Sarandon as Mom. That little boy and his chimpanzee had a really bizarre and funny scene with the solo of the song ""Free Bird"" as background.Conclusion: Great visuals and a rare narrative style, with the faces of the characters in the entire screen, makes ""Speed Racer"" a worth entertainment. In my humble opinion this film is just underrated here and by all the critics. Anyway I think will be worth to go and see it on IMAX and also I think this film and ""Iron Man"" will be my favourites of this year's summer, just waiting to see what ""The Dark Knight"" and the new stuff of Jack Black (""Tropic Thunder"" and ""Kung Fu Panda"") will offer.",Speed Racer
47,eric262003,A Great Movie Based on a Cartoon,9,6 April 2009,"Last year I saw the the screening of ""Speed Racer"" and being a devoted fan of the cartoon series, I knew I was going to see something special. I was afraid to see it at first because in the past, movies adapted from cartoons have been spoiled pretty badly. But I still managed to main my optimism, to go and see it for the sake of it. In the end, I was awestruck by the movie overall. It started off at a snail's pace at first, but as it gradually progressed, I thought to myself, this is one of the best cartoon adapted feature I've seen in long time. It out-shined a lot of other summer blockbusters that came out at the time. Several themes from the cartoon were taken to in this movie including the humor and the little nods it gives to the audience which I will not give too much out and for everybody to see for themselves. At the same time contributed their own unique style to give it their flavor to it without breaking the tradition the symbolized the ""Speed Racer"" formula. One of the great abilities that I liked about the cars is that the springs below the cars gives them access to flip over other cars and anything that gets in their way. In contrast to the cartoon that only the Mach 5 was able to do. Other cool features include the back wheels turning which resulted in very direct, effective turns. Throw in some silly weapons that were useful and you have yourself an entertaining action flick. From the makers who brought you ""The Matrix"", provided plenty of crashes, explosions and destructions, but the story still kept an easy flow. Every character was put in their place and there was never a confusing moment. The last race was a bit lost in the shuffle. The slow motion was a great trait in which we can observe the cool movements in all its glorious details. The fight scene at the mountain was beautifully lensed as we get to view everyone involved. This was one of the best scenes in the film mostly due to the camera work and the colors. The style of this movie is breath-taking. The feeling of the future is very captivating but the ideology can still be taken in retro to what people in the 1960's interpreted the 21 century that can be a bit outdated. The cars are updated and people's lives are looked upon in an future perspective, but the physical appearances and fashion are still prodigy's of the 1960's. The colors were loud and vocal, but the loudness of the colors will grab your attention. It was very art deco in its format and the eye-candy will keeping you seated. The acting was excellent from the young stars like Emile Hirsch and Matthew Fox and the veteran performers like John Goodman and Susan Sarandon. Nicholas Elia who plays the young Speed looked too much like he's still reciting his lines was the weak-link performance wise. But the performers complimented the writers with great acting overall and hats off to them. It may look like a kids family movie, but that's a bit of a misnomer. In act there is some strong language and there's lots of grueling scenes that will have you biting your fingernails. But it's still enjoyable for the whole family to enjoy. As a film critic I scoff at what the other critics say. Come on now, it's based on a cartoon. it's not meant to be real. And it wasn't that overdone in action sequences. The races are awesome, the story is compelling and the characters are ones you can relate to. Overall a very fun movie to watch. One that made me as giddy as a kid in the candy store. It was the most I've ever had in movie watching. I hope a sequel is in the works. This one truly deserves it.",Speed Racer
48,Matt_Layden,Can A Film Be Too Close To It's Source Material???,5,12 May 2008,"For those not familiar with the story, Speed Racer is not what this film is about, but who it is about. Yes, Speed Racer is the main characters name and that is exactly what he does. After the death of his brother, Speed follows in his footsteps to become the worlds fastest racer. His speed and talent catches the eye of a big rich racing company who offers Speed more wins and more money. When Speed declines, he learns the truth that the grand prix is fixed and they knew the winner of each race all along. Now it's up to Speed to win the big race and show the corrupt business side of everything.Whether or not this makes sense is of no importance. I don't really think people are going to see this movie for it's deep plot, character development or even creative twists in the storyline. Instead Speed Racer expects to see it's audience that want to be gasping at the insane races, vivid colours and tongue in cheek comedy. Speed Racer has all this, maybe a bit too much, and none of the former. I've never seen a single episode of the cartoon, but in the style the bros have presented this film you can tell immediately that they stuck pretty close to the source material. Knowing the Japanese animation style, Speed Racer has captured it pretty accurately. My only concern is, was a story like this meant to be made into a live action film? I can appreciate the film for what is tries to achieve and respect it for that. The racing scenes are indeed spectacular, but the is what is expected. We all knew that the film would have crazy racing scenes that bend the norm of our world and it did just that. The race scenes make the viewer more interested in wanting to play them in a video game. They make the viewer want to be involved, instead we have to sit there and watch other people on the screen have all the fun and excitement. It kind of gets a little bit upsetting.There are vibrant colours all throughout the film, like a lucid dream. Most likely exactly what the filmmakers wanted, it plays out like a dream from Hunter S. Thompson. It is exciting for kids, headache for adults. The use of colour and the detailed eye to the surroundings make the film seem more like an experiment in the digital era, rather then an attempt to make an actual film. The one thing that kept going through my mind was how this film would look on Blue-Ray, not what was actually happening on the screen.The film has many missteps, the main one would be the editing. The entire opening sequence the details the reason for Speed's reason for driving is horribly done. It plays out exactly like a racing video game and jumps back and forth between time lines. Let me explain. Rex, Speed's older brother, who holds racing records all over the world leaves the house to race in a dangerous tournament, this is inter cut with Speed racing trying to break his brother's current record, his brother is also racing the same track, but it is Speed's memory of it. If you've ever played a racing game, it's exactly like you trying to beat the your previous time on the track and you are racing you're ghost car from before. All of this is confusing at first, and once you get a grasp of what is going on, the horrible pacing settles in. They use a lot of super imposed images of people crossing the screen to move to the next scene. It's when the camera paces across a character's face and an entire different scene is behind them. They over use so much that in one particular scene there are more then a dozen characters on the screen all inter cutting each other.Yes the entire film is based on a cartoon and that is exactly the way it plays out. Everything is over the top and corny. A little too much if you ask me. The violence isn't harsh, people blow up in their cars, but it won't scare kids. Although, the random appearance of ninjas might. Yes, John Goodman fights a ninja in this movie....then says this exact line. ""Ninja? Ha, more like a Nonja"". That is the kind of dialogue this film has and it hurts to listen to it.The actors aren't really given anything to do. Goodman and Hirsh are the highlights as expected. I wanted to like Fox and Racer X, but his monotone delivery and the story behind his character is just too bland. The conclusion at the end of the film with Racer X seemed tacked on and out of left field. As if they needed to beat us over the head with answers that they audience already knew, even though they were told something else. Christine Ricci and Susan Surandon are given absolutely nothing to do in this film. They are filler, eye candy at most. The young brother and his ape sidekick are there for comic relief, but it tends to be the same joke over and over again with them. It gets tiresome very fast.In the end, the film is more for pleasing the eye. The poor editing and over the top cartoon style is just too much of a distraction. The story itself isn't very engaging and the people involved don't even seem to know what's going on either. The film has many problems and too few entertaining points. If a racing scene couldn't save The Pantom Menace, it can't save Speed Racer.",Speed Racer
49,lewiskendell,"Lots of very pretty, entertaining action.",7,10 December 2010,"""It doesn't matter if racing never changes. What matters is if we let racing change us.""I thought Speed Racer was a pretty good adaptation of the manga and anime. Visually, it was astounding. In HD, the colors are incredibly bright and vivid, and the constant special effects really helped to bring the world to life. I imagine people who watched Tron for the first time back in the 80's might have had a similar reaction to what I had watching this. All the various camera techniques used to make it look similar to the comic books worked well, and I just really liked the style of the whole thing. I don't think I've ever used this phrase before, but it really was a feast for the eyes.As for the rest of the movie, I also liked the cast. Emilie Hirsch might not have immediately jumped into my mind as the ideal Speed, but he worked. So did the actors playing the rest of his family and acquaintances (both helpful and adversarial), and Christina Ricci as Trixie. It took a while for Matthew Fox to grow on me as Racer X, but by the end I had to admit that he wasn't a bad choice, either.The story was a combination of some original material and a bunch of new stuff that the Wachowski's came up with, and it made for a fun, if conventional, plot. The races were suitably thrilling, there were several funny scenes (what could have been an annoying role by Paulie Litt as Speed's younger brother, actually ended up being quite humorous), and I had a smile on my face more often than not. That's the recipe for an enjoyable movie, in my opinion. Try it if the source material interest you, or you'd just like to watch a fun movie full of eye candy",Speed Racer
50,moviewizguy,Go! Speed Racer!,7,24 May 2008,"Hurtling down the track, careening around, over and through the competition, Speed Racer is a natural behind the wheel. Born to race cars, Speed is aggressive, instinctive and, most of all, fearless. His only real competition is the memory of the brother he idolized-the legendary Rex Racer - whose death in a race has left behind a legacy that Speed is driven to fulfill.Speed is loyal to the family racing business, led by his father, Pops Racer, the designer of Speed's thundering Mach 5. When Speed turns down a lucrative and tempting offer from Royalton Industries, he not only infuriates the company's maniacal owner but uncovers a terrible secret-some of the biggest races are being fixed by a handful of ruthless moguls who manipulate the top drivers to boost profits. If Speed won't drive for Royalton, Royalton will see to it that the Mach 5 never crosses another finish line.The only way for Speed to save his family's business and the sport he loves is to beat Royalton at his own game. With the support of his family and his loyal girlfriend, Trixie, Speed teams with his one-time rival-the mysterious Racer X - to win the race that had taken his brother's life: the death-defying, cross-country rally known as The Crucible.This is the first film I've ever seen in IMAX. Honestly, I was amazed. The film was truly one of the best looking films I've ever seen! Brilliant eye candy throughout the film! And for that reason alone, you should watch this movie. After the disappointing box office earnings from it's opening weekend, ""Speed Racer"" will most definitely go down as a cult classic, unless there's a sequel.Sure, there's ""Iron Man"" but you expect people would have already seen that movie, but that movie is getting better each week! Unfortunately, this film is left out to die. Yes, I'm disappointed that more people didn't see it and I don't know why but that's life.Now, as the movie itself, it was really good. The plot, although stretching a bit with the many different plot lines, was good. I actually liked it. However, I do think the movie ran a bit too long, sometimes dragging in the middle part of the film. It could've been a fast paced 90 minute entertaining film, but it was tolerable.The cast has a lot of fun here. Each single person in here plays the role really well, although I wasn't a fan of the original cartoon series. This is definitely an ensemble film and does not only focus on Emile Hirsch himself. The visuals - what can I say more? It's all eye candy! It's all so brilliant and fresh, unlike anything you've ever seen in your life! Absolutely stunning! The Wachowskis did a really great job creating the world!But there's a time, here and there, when the characters Chim-Chim, the monkey, and Spritle, played by Paulie Litt, get a little annoying. They are the comedic characters in here and they feel a bit unnecessary but I completely understand they were annoying, as well, in the original series.If you want to watch this movie, it's because you want to have a lot of fun and see a lot of amazing visuals and CGI the movie has set for you. The movie could've been a bit shorter and the plot a bit cleaner but overall, it's a really fun movie for the family! I enjoyed it quite a bit!",Speed Racer

53,MartianOctocretr5,A lot better than expected - this Speed's a winner,8,6 July 2008,"A superior outing, for one of these classic cartoon adaptations. After seeing some others get mangled recently, this one surprises with a solid balance of maintaining the spirit of its source material, while utilizing modern technology to not only faithfully reenact the way the original cartoon was done, but to enhance it.The cartoon's upbeat self-satire deliberately cheesy dialog was revisited perfectly. The original had a lot of heart: Speed Racer always maintained a strict code of ethics both on and off the track, and the movie played this up to the hilt. The bad guys were always depicted as dimwitted knuckleheads; this film has that too right down to the bad hair days and derby hats.The cast were all great. John Goodman really had Pops down, Christina Ricci made a cute Trixie. Spreidel and Chim-Chim were just like their cartoon counterparts.The visuals of the races were spot on. The imagination about what the near future of technology might look like and its presentation were splendid to watch. The editing of commentators and flash backs were all integrated perfectly. Probably the most memorable was how this film's interpretation of the inevitable good guys vs. bad guy fights was handled; the blur effect was hilarious, just like the original show.No Oscars will be handed out for a show obviously aimed at kids and a nostalgic glance for their parents. But it accomplishes everything you could ask from one of these TV show adaptations. Great family viewing.",Speed Racer
54,Maciste_Brother,120 minutes of annoying transitions,1,10 January 2010,"I saw SPEED RACER on a movie channel and the film was barely watchable. Anyone who says this film is good is seriously delusional, knows nothing about movies or needs to see a psychiatrist.This ""film"" had two major flaws (three if you count the script):The first major flaw is the way it was filmed. It wants to be an live action version of the classic Japanese animated series, which was mainly flat renditions of the animated characters in simple color schemes and yet for the film the actors and sets were filmed with deep shadows, gradients, etc. The cinematography should have been simple with a minimal of details. Such as it was though it overloaded every inch of the screen with gaudy effects or color with the humans lost in all of it. Visually, it's a disaster from start to finish.The second major error was the extreme overuse of transitions throughout the 2 hour running time. Practically every second (yes, SECOND) the Wachowskis used fade ins, fade outs, overlaps, cross dissolve, etc, not to go from one scene to another but from one shot to another within the same scene. For two whole hours. It's mind boggling bad, boneheaded and really makes me question if the brothers even know how to direct. Transitions are cool and fun from time to time but supremely annoying if overused and in SPEED RACER they don't overuse it, they ABUSE it which makes for a painful viewing experience. It's no wonder the film bombed. It's simply impossible to get into it with those two major flaws.",Speed Racer
55,Sirus_the_Virus,"How to describe the Wachowski's newest film? MInd bendingly neat looking, mind numbingly stupid",1,20 November 2009,"I know I am a little late on reviewing this. I am actually pretty glad that I am late. I wish I never would saw this film. Two precious hours of my life wasted in this expensive mess. Truly, a huge disappointment.The Wachowski brothers have done a few films. Bound, and the Matrix trilogy. I told you, only a few movies. Well, 5 years after the somewhat disappointing Matrix Revolutions, The Wachouski's needed something to bring them back. So they made this neat looking, expensive ass film, hoping because of the visuals, it would be a huge blockbuster. Well, the movie tanked. Now, I see why.The film is based on the cartoon, called Speed Racer. The reason why both words are capitalized is because that happens to be the name of the main character named Speed(Emile Hirsch).I can see why it's based on a cartoon. It's way too cartoony, and that happens to be one of it's dozen flaws.Speed's entire family has been racing for years. His own brother was even killed during a race called the Crucibal. Which Speed considers racing in. Speed gets the support of his family(Played by Susan Surandon and John Goodman), his long time friend and girlfriend Trixie(Christina Ricci, the only good performance in the film, besides a few other people). And Spritle, an incredibly irritating character and his monkey Chim Chim.The cartoon wasn't very creative. Clearly. Chim Chim for a chimpanzee? Come on. I'm sure it was better though. The film is way too corny, way too cheesy, way too annoying, way too much horrible acting, mostly from Matthew Fox as Racer X.I felt really sorry for the actors in this movie. It's not their fault. It's the Wachouski's. I'll admit that the film is cool looking, but it is mind numbingly stupid.Speed racer:No stars out of ****",Speed Racer
56,emasterslake,Surprisely enjoyable.,8,10 May 2008,"I had my doubts that this film will be any good. Since in the past there's never been a highly enjoyable based off of a cartoon movie that anyone would say it's good.But after reading the first hand full of comments. I was surprised to read more positive reviews than the usual negative kind. And I agree, Speed Racer is possibly the first based off of a cartoon movie to actually not suck at all. It's also one of the first known movies to be based off of an anime.An updated version of the first and earliest successful anime in America for the past 40 years. It's about a young man, Speed Racer who was born to be the best racer in the world. His family runs their own car business and life was good for Speed. Until one day a high class race car industrialist is interested in having Speed work for him in the big Grand Prix races. Speed however knows there's something going on with this industry that's won every race since the first ever motor car race.The direction is better than expected. The Walowski Bros. have gain a lot of money from their previous success from the Matrix Trilogy. And since they're both anime fans. So they pretty much know what Speed Racer is, which prevented this movie from going far from it's proceeder. I think that's what all these types of movies need. Are directors that actually seen the series and know what people want to see.The story and plot has very little recycled ideas that already existed from the original anime. I really appreciated on how the Walowski Bros. used all their effort in making this movie feel absolutely new instead of something we've already seen in the anime.The characters, almost all of them look exactly like they do from the anime. Only exceptions are Inspector Detector, Racer X, and Sparky's appearances. Inspector Detector wears glasses, less muscular, and is missing his trademark pipe. But is still a morale justice inspector. Racer X is still a smooth, clever, and cool racer working with the police. Only difference is his costume is slightly altered. Sparky is still Speed's friend and handy man with the Racer family. One he has a five o'clock shadow which wasn't the characteristics of the original Sparky.The acting overall is as good as it gets. The actor who did Speed portrays the part exactly as you would predict him to be. The one who does Trixie fits the part well, including the trademark bowl cut hair. John Goodman makes a fine choice for the brute short tempered father. Sarah Sarandon was suitable for Mom Racer, even though she portrays as the only Speed Racer character who has little involvement in the series. Sprital's actor fits the description as the mischievous candy loving kid brother like in the original series. I'm glad they had an actual chimp playing Chim-Chim and is pretty good for the part.The visuals, 94% of the backgrounds and scenery in this movie is done on CGI. Which is a pretty nice effect to recreate the colorful environment of the retro/advanced world of Speed Racer. All of the cars, buildings, tracks, and fictional countries all make you feel like you are watching the cartoon instead of the the movie. While the scenes containing stiff extras gives it an old animation look to it.The differences, I've seen the entire anime way before this was in production. The only things I notice the filmmakers changed are Rex Racer flashbacks and the features on the Mach 5. The flashbacks on Speed's brother Rex Racer are different, and more complex than the anime did. While the Mach 5's features include the actual A-G buttons. Only exception is that there's no oxygen tank/submarine scope for underwater travel or EM headlights. The move also talks a little about Speed and Trixie when they were kids, which was never shown in the anime.Overall, if you are a fan of the anime. You won't be too disappointed with this movie. Cause it's far from being terrible like other live action adapt-ions. And I would choose this over live action Garfield or Scooby Doo. Those who never seen the anime would think of this movie being bogus. Also despite it being PG, it has more swearing than the anime did and Spritel got away with using the middle finger in one scene. And a censored s word scene. So it's recommended for ages 10 and up.For once, there's a live action cartoon movie that doesn't suck at all.",Speed Racer
57,jaredmobarak,"See, this race is full of cheaters  Speed Racer",6,21 June 2009,"I'm going to preface this review by saying I have no clue about anything ""Speed Racer"". I've never seen the cartoon, I don't know the ins and outs or plot lines, nor if the source material was tongue-in-cheek and campy. Truthfully, I am glad I went into the Wachowskis' film adaptation Speed Racer this way. Perhaps the tone took me by surprise in how grating and annoying it could be at times, (I wanted to kill Spritle and Chim Chim from their first moment on screen), and maybe I wouldn't have been so taken aback having known that was a crucial part of the world at hand, but otherwise, going in fresh allowed the environment to absorb me in. The film is by no means a masterpiece, heck it isn't even great, but it is far from the drivel so much I've read dismissed it as.This is a cinematic video game that assaults the senses. Right down the line, from the crisp visuals with a cartoon-like depth of field; the sheer amount of graphic/computer work; the floating heads flying past the screen in conversation, overlapping each other, mimicking game cut scenes and I believe the original cartoon; to the amateurish voicework from the actors, I felt as though I should have had a controller in my hands, pressing the A through F buttons right along with Speed in his Mach 5. The animated backgrounds were very obviously just that, though, and the blatant green screen usage screams at you every second. I believe that the cartoon look may actually detract from the realism because having everything in focus only shows how starkly different the live actors and computer environments are. Without any blurring or shading for depth, the three-dimensional people appear awkwardly flat in their two-dimensional fields. As for the color and the cars, however, you can't avoid their effectiveness.Speed Racer excels in the car races. At first I thought it was a little too much, boring me as the vehicles go without me being able to control them. As the movie progressed though, I began to sit back and enjoy the visuals for what they were; I completely bought into the tracks and the cheating and the quirky cast of characters, especially on the cross country race with the hired hands set to take out Speed and his team. I absolutely loved the bit in the ice caves watching the lights trail from the sheer car speed around bends. The cars have so much drift that the lights whipping around curves linger, and the effect is rendered beautifully. If only they didn't have to cut to the actors so much in the driver's seat, it would have been that much better. Maybe a complete animated work might have been a more effective use of the technology, especially when you have to watch the reaction shots of the Racer family in the stands jumping with glee. It is so false and cartoonish that it becomes more laughable than endearing.And this is exactly where the film falls apart—the performances. Even Christina Ricci, with a face built for anime, seems to be hamming it up too much as Trixie. Seldom used anyways, she becomes a cheerleader with such exuberance that you just want to look away. And Paulie Litt's Spirtle  wow, you cannot be more annoying than him. Think Jim Carrey as a young boy, doing crazy things and being loud. Throw in a monkey and you have a duo that adds more to the temptation to shut the film off than comic relief—Jar Jar Binks anyone? With moments such as them pretending to be ninjas, similar to a cartoon they watch on television, cut out against black with bright color lines going across the screen and a later spliced in superimposed warning to the audience that the following moment may be ""unsuitable to kootie-prone viewers,"" I was completely taken out of the action.I did, however, enjoy Emile Hirsch, as our titular hero, and Matthew Fox as the mysterious villainous savior Racer X. Both kept their roles steeped in reality while still adding some flair to relate with the more outrageous things going on. They were believable behind the wheel, even though the effects work recalled old television shows that have a stationary car in front of a moving screen with stock traffic footage playing in the background. Both these men emoted well and gave some credibility to an otherwise ludicrous supporting cast. Roger Allam's Royalton is operating on such a high level of camp that it is hard to take anything happening seriously. His dynamic with the racing world—fixing things and making it all about money—may have been crucial to the plot, but only detracts from what Speed Racer is really about: the racing, and nothing more. The action-heavy Wachowskis do not disappoint in that regard.In order to appreciate a film such as this, you need to really buy into it all. This is a world where people's last names are their occupations, (The Racer family, Inspector Detector, etc.), so you shouldn't be expecting high drama. I do believe, though, that the film ends up being caught in the middle of pure absurdity and true serious storytelling. Being a full-blown cartoon might have helped, allowing preconceptions of live action to never find their way in front of just having a good time. When you ask real people to act like cartoons, you have to really be in control of what it is you want to accomplish, because the line between success and dismal failure is very thin. Speed Racer balances the tightrope for the most part, but if it were to slip and fall, I fear it would land on the side full of throwaways that meant well and looked good, but just didn't have what it took to last.",Speed Racer
58,thekarmicnomad,"Trashy, imposing - but really quite good",7,9 November 2014,"I put this on as I purposely felt like watching something rubbish and trashy. Which this is with its slap stick comedy, cheesy characters and manic delivery.But I have to admit the action and the production were really quite good. The cars skid, jump, flip, fly, spin into each other mid air like gladiators- all at dizzying speed.Every scene is saturated with colour, making even narrative scenes vivid assaults on the eyeballs.The story is pretty stupid but does the job well enough with plenty of twists to keep kids amused.Of course this is a kids film and all the points I mentioned before are likely to be a big hit with kids.A lot of imagination has gone into the sets and race tracks. There is very little violence but a few menacing scenes.This films only real claim to fame is losing 25 million odd dollars - but it is actually quite good. If you are going to watch this with the kids (it is totally doable) don't attempt it half-strength or with a hang-over as the fast moving, bright lights and wailing engines will finish you off.",Speed Racer
59,Beta_Gallinger,"Usually underwhelming for a while, often skipping around too fast, but the suspense builds up later on",7,14 February 2011,"This 2008 action blockbuster didn't catch my attention because I was a fan of the 60's anime series (I'm not even familiar with that show), but because this live action movie was written and directed by Andy and Larry (apparently now Lana) Wachowski. I knew them as the writers and directors of the ""Matrix"" trilogy and the writers of ""V for Vendetta"". I certainly wasn't expecting ""Speed Racer"" to be as good as the original ""Matrix"" or ""V for Vendetta"", but its reputation led me to believe that it could be a pretty good PG-rated family film. When I watched this particular effort from the Wachowskis from start to finish, it turned out to be disappointing for a while, but after I think a little less than an hour, it definitely improved for me.As a kid, Speed Racer is obsessed with car racing. It seems to be the only thing he can think about, which makes it very hard for him to concentrate in school. His father, Pops, runs an independent race car company called Racer Motors, and the boy's older brother, Rex, is a racing champion! Pops and Rex have a falling out when the older Racer brother decides to take part in corporate racing. Rex gets a bad reputation when he is accused of cheating, and then after an accident during a cross-country race, it appears he is dead! Years later, Speed is a young man, taking the world of racing by storm, just like is older brother once did. E.P. Arnold Royalton, the owner of Royalton Industries, comes and offers Speed to sign a contract and race for his company, for which the young racer will get to live a life of luxury. After thinking for a while, Speed reaches the decision to refuse this offer, but Royalton is a corporate tyrant, and this refusal makes him very angry, so he intends to make sure the young man never wins another race! We are introduced to the protagonist at the beginning of the film by seeing what life is like for him in grade school, and this part isn't great, but it can be amusing at times, with the conversation between Speed's mother and his teacher, and the sound the boy makes during his racing fantasy in class. However, for quite a while, there may be some good parts, but it's usually underwhelming. The first race sequence is perhaps a little tedious, and the scenes tend to skip around a lot. At one point, we are introduced to a new character by suddenly seeing him beaten up and then almost fed to piranhas! The way Speed and Trixie (his girlfriend) first look at each other as kids, what Royalton says about pancakes, and the romantic scene with Speed and Trixie in a car are among the weak parts of the film. Also, Spritle (Speed's younger brother) and his pet chimpanzee, Chim Chim, are certainly not as funny as they're supposed to be. However, for some reason, after just less than an hour, the film improved for me, rising from a 5 to a 6/10. With all the suspense and some touching moments during the rest of the film, it was a 7/10 for me by the end. This ""Speed Racer"" movie also has some stunning visuals, and while there may not be TOO many cast highlights, I would say at least Susan Sarandon and John Goodman stand out as the Racer parents.This movie's reputation doesn't suggest that it's an amazing film, which it isn't, but to me, even if much of it turned out to be duller than I was expecting, I still found some entertainment value in it, I can't deny that. Maybe I would have liked this live action blockbuster more if I had been familiar with the animated series which it is based on beforehand, but overall, I guess I still found it impressive enough, as lacklustre as it looked for a while. ""The Matrix"" and ""V for Vendetta"" are both R-rated movies, while ""Speed Racer"" is rated PG and considered a family movie, which means that it's not quite the same idea as either of the previous two mentioned films from the Wachowskis. Maybe the siblings are not as good at this kind of film as they are at their usual R-rated fare, but they certainly could have done a much worse job. For fans of visually stunning action blockbusters, this one could be enjoyable.",Speed Racer

61,adamscastlevania2,Largely painful to watch crap,3,27 October 2014,"(25%) A real mystery piece this. It's well cast, it had an established fan base, the directors should know what they are doing, the budget was generous. So what the hell went wrong? Well for starters the plot is hopelessly told, it's a real mess, the script needed major work. The racing scenes are if anything so fast and choppy that it is impossible to know who is winning or what's going on, and to make matters worse they are interrupted almost constantly, a lot of the time for little or no real reason (a five second cut to a foreign speaking commentator overreacting to the painful to watch action) making an already hard to follow sequence simply impossible to get any sort of enjoyment from. Then there's the effects themselves with some parts looking impressive, while others look like a poor Playstation 1 game with radioactive green trees and all too apparent use of green screen. There are parts after the awful first 15 minutes when this feels like it's going to settle down and start becoming maybe a decent move, but it doesn't last, and it soon begins to wave its arms and legs around like a hyperactive idiot while it becomes no longer possible to care at all about anything that happens. This is quite a bad flop all told as it doesn't get hardly anything right, and something this awful at telling a simple story deserves to fail in my books. Although the pet chimp, all be it random, was great fun.",Speed Racer
62,fwomp,All Sparkle With No Substance...,3,12 April 2009,"Being both heavily into THE MATRIX trilogy and the original SPEED RACER cartoon of the late 60s, I went into this re-imagining with high hopes. I figured surely the Wachowski brothers could do it justice if anyone could.I had to think back to my childhood and remember if the cartoon was really that good, and I must say that, in its day, it was. It was also probably the first anime I'd ever seen, and I enjoyed the style immensely. But one has to wonder if that style would translate well to a feature film in today's market. Although there must certainly be fans of this film out-and-about, you won't find one here. Why? you might ask. For me, it was the complete lack of a coherent story flow. Anime isn't necessarily known for this anyway, which was why I questioned Speed Racer being made into a movie in the first place. I think the Hollywood big-wigs must've thought that they could tug the memory-strings of those who'd grown up with the cartoon series and get them to plop down hard-earned cash at the box office. Not to mention attaching big name directors and stars to it. Undoubtedly the film did well because of these aforementioned items. But if you're looking for anything approaching substance, you won't find it here. The film is a zig-zagging, nonstop, car race (for the most part) that leaves no time for the audiences eyes to rest. This created a sort of disorientation for me, in that I felt I was being pushed (or dragged) along throughout the entire film. It was like the film makers didn't want you to rest and think about ...anything. ""Just enjoy the cool cars, the excess colors, and all this action,"" is what they seemed to be saying. Although Emile Hirsch (MILK) did an okay job with what he was given, I simply didn't care about him or his family in any way, shape or form because I never got to know them (we were always ""racing"" from one car race to the next).That said, I did discover some things that worried me as a kid:1. Pops Racer hasn't died of high blood pressure. He's got his temper semi-under control. 2. Sparky is gay. For sure. Did you see the way he looked at Speedy's butt? 3. Mom Racer needs to get laid. Desperately. She's too wound up. 4.Racer X. Is he Speedy's long, lost brother. Well ...you'll have to watch and find out.I have to wonder if kids who can't sit through stories that develop good characters wouldn't enjoy this flick. It moves so fast that I don't think it'd give them time to care. Which might be why Speed Racer did better than I thought it would at the cinema...",Speed Racer
63,jon.h.ochiai,Go Speed Racer,9,21 April 2008,"Watching Speed Racer convincingly win a spectacular race nearly besting his brother Rex's course record is the mysteriously charismatic Racer X (handsome brooding Matthew Fox). Racer X's beautiful companion tells him, ""He's going to be great."" With restrained pride Racer X says, ""No, he's going to be the best"" ""Speed Racer"" was my favorite cartoon growing up as a kid. Speed Racer was the brave hero. But the truly cool hero was Racer X. Racer X was the shadowy masked racer, who was Speed's rival and amazing equal. However, Racer X seemed more Speed's protector than arch-rival. There is more to the Speed and Racer X dynamic and mythology that will go unsaid, although fans of this cult classic already know.My bud Lauren invited me to a screening of the Wachowski Brothers' live action adaptation ""Speed Racer"". I gladly accepted, and told Lauren of the ""Speed Racer"" mythos. As both writers and directors, the Wachowski Brothers brilliantly bring to life the world of ""Speed Racer"". ""Speed Racer"" has a visually distinctive style all its own. The vibrant colors and breathtaking CGI racing sequences enthrall with velocity and emotion. There is even homage to a scene from the animated series as Speed's Mach 5 careens over a mountain road during a treacherous cross continent race, and plunges to almost certain doom. But no worries here. Set in what looks like the near future, ""Speed Racer"" is visual spectacle and precision-- surprisingly ground in its story of love and family. Emile Hirsch plays the intense Speed Racer, son of Pops and Mom Racer (John Goodman and Susan Sarandon). Speed's passion is being the best auto racer, and destined for greatness. In a touching scene of a mother's pride Mom confesses to Speed, ""I am so impossibly proud of you"" Speed lives in the shadow of his late brother Rex Racer. Growing up, Rex was Speed's hero, and the greatest racer there ever was. However, after a vehement disagreement Pops disowns Rex. Rex gains fame and infamy on the racing circuit until his tragic death in the cross continent raceThe Crucible. The Racer family grieved the loss of the elder son. Does Speed race to honor Rex or does he race for himself?Now years later, Speed is offered a lucrative contract to race for Mr. Royalton (pompous Nicholas Elia) and his Royalton Industries. Speed rejects the offer choosing to remain with Pops Racer (Goodman) and the family business. Consequently, Royalton vows to destroy Speed. The determined Inspector Detector (solid Nicholas Elia) and Racer X enroll Speed to help them expose Royalton's international racing conspiracy. Against Pops' wishes Speed enters The Crucible along with teammates: Taejo Togokhan (Rain) and the mysterious Racer X. Speed is well aware that The Crucible claimed the life of his brother Rex. However, there is something hauntingly familiar about Racer X. For Speed: Is this merely coincidence? The Wachowski Brothers' narrative moves at a nearly blinding pace. Cleary, they have a reverence for the original cartoon. They even provide slick martial arts action, which ""Speed Racer"" had way back when. Racer X (Fox) powerfully dispatches ninja attackers. And Rain as Taejo displays amazing martial arts grace and style. The performances throughout ""Speed Racer"" are strong. Emile Hirsch captures the wonder and conflict of a young hero emerging into his own. Christina Ricci as Speed's girlfriend Trixie is smart and spirited. John Goodman and Susan Sarandon are incredible. Pops and Mom Racer may have been intended as caricatures; however, Goodman and Sarandon breathe humanity and a parent's love in their roles. They subtly reflect their pride in Speed, and painful regret for Rex. Matthew Fox is powerful and commanding as Racer X. Fox brings a nobility and grace to this mysterious hero, who embodies a Zen-like spirit to racing.""Speed Racer"" is spectacular fun with a surprisingly compelling story. Amidst the flashy eye candy and masterful CGI, ""Speed Racer"" is about the power of love, family, and the inherent greatness in all people. Take a chance on ""Speed Racer"".",Speed Racer
64,Benjamin-M-Weilert,Visually explosive.,10,19 May 2019,"I believe the best description for this movie would be ""lighting some fireworks, throwing them into a dryer, and climbing in."" That being said, it was a good representation of the campy sixties television show. Plus, you had the quintessential Wachowski kung-fu slow motion scene. In the end, it followed the cliche anime sequence, with flashbacks in the beginning to set the stage, then flashbacks during the big fight at the end. Also, Matthew Fox looks good when he's not portraying a homeless man on LOST. All being said and done, it was an entertaining film that paced the action out into manageable pieces.",Speed Racer
65,cultfilmfan,Speed Racer,8,10 May 2008,"Speed Racer is a live action feature film version based on the Japanese animated television series of the same name from the late 1960's. The film version just like the animated series focuses on a young man named Speed, who thanks to his auto mechanic father and racing car driver brother, has become fascinated with racing cars and now that he has grown up, has dreams of winning a big cross country car race. We are introduced to all of the same characters who frequent the television show and of course it wouldn't be complete without an evil doer making trouble for Speed and the other racers and as you might have already guessed there are several races throughout the film as well. The film like I already mentioned is using real actors and is set against a digital background enhanced by computers much like last year's film 300. I remember watching the Speed Racer program on television when I was younger and I always enjoyed it. The show didn't particularly have the best animation, the English voice dubbing was sometimes not very good and a lot of the time the sheer joy and entertainment that came from watching the show was because of how silly and most likely unintentionally funny it was. It was like watching a B movie from the 50's every week on television and even at a young age I enjoyed it much like I do now. Even a couple of years ago a specialty cable station on television brought back the episodes in reruns and I still thought they were entertaining and made a point of watching them when they were on. Going into this movie version I figured if the filmmakers were true to the spirit and vision of the original show then I would have a good time in the theatre, much like I did watching it at home. Overall, I was very pleased with what I saw. The characters were all here and so was the humorous touches and usually I 'am not a big fan of computer generated effects, but the visuals in this film really made a big impact on me because they are so bright and colourful and really this film is a feast for the eyes because of everything from the backgrounds to the sets having bright standout colours which really give the film a great look. Aside from the look I thought all the actors did a good job mimicking the characters from the original and the plot while a little complicated and confusing at first was a lot of fun and filled with action, great visuals, humour and entertainment that pleased me as an adult and seemed to please the younger children in the audience, who most likely are not aware of the original show. What a joy it was to have an accurate and well done feature film version of a guilty pleasure television show that I liked to watch growing up. Everything, I enjoyed from the original was back here and with the beautiful eye candy and very entertaining story as well as faced paced direction this film sure comes out as a winner. Also a note to the critics who didn't like this film, try watching the original show first and base your judgments on that because for those who didn't like this film, I think they are unaware of the original series and the style the filmmakers were going for that they exceeded very well.",Speed Racer
66,eminkl,How did they pull this off with a straight face?,2,17 April 2020,"The Wachowskis pull out every green screen trick in the book for this glowing block of candy-colored nostalgia, draped in the wallpaper of a classic '60s anime. The whole thing functions more like an experiment than a film, a proof of concept gone bad, staffed by several well-regarded stars, that somehow grinds on for 135 minutes. It's like sharing a daydream with a hyperactive six-year-old on a sugar rush. There's so much going on at any given time, so many violent splashes of jagged colors and wildly animated background details, that a complete viewing can feel downright exhausting. The tech doesn't even appear to be there yet, either; the whole mess comes off as clumsy and awkward, a mismatched wreck that conflicts and clashes with itself. One post-race attempt to recreate Speed's fluid leap from his moving race car, landing right in a dynamic signature pose (a staple of the old cartoon's title sequence), is so corny and improbable I couldn't help bursting into laughter. An utterly baffling film that deserves every bit of infamy it's accumulated. How did they pull this off with a straight face?",Speed Racer
67,ja_kitty_71,Speed zooms to the big screen,10,27 October 2008,"As I said (many times), I am a HUGE anime fan. Especially anime from the 1960s, which I didn't know there was anime in the 1960s. ""Speed Racer"" is one of my favorite anime series and I had watched it when it was on TV. After watching the trailer online, I was so psyched that there's going to be a live-action ""Speed Racer"" movie. I had recently bought the DVD and after watching the movie, I thought it was awesome!In the film, Speed Racer is an 18-year-old whose life and love has always been racing. Racing is ""in his blood"": his parents, Pops and Mom, run an independent business building race cars; though in the film, his older brother Rex Racer, is depicted as a record-setting racer, who was killed in Speed's childhood in the running of the Casa Cristo, an incredibly intense cross-country racing rally notorious for rough and foul play. And before his death, Rex was rejected by his father for his choice to run the Casa Cristo, and publicly defamed for appearing to cheat underhandedly in a race. Now, Speed Racer is quickly sweeping the racing world with his artistic skill, driving the Mach 5 (and later the Mach 6) of his father's design, but remains interested only in the art of the race and the well-being of his family. When Mr. Royalton, owner of conglomerate Royalton Industries, offers Speed an astoundingly luxurious lifestyle in exchange for signing to race with him, Speed is tempted but declines, knowing that his father would never wish Speed to sign with the very power-hungry corporations he so mistrusts. When Speed refuses Mr. Royalton's offer, Royalton reveals that top corporate interests, including Royalton himself, are fixing the races to gain profit, and then threatens Speed's career success and very life when he still does not agree to sign on. When Royalton later proves ready to make good on his threats, Speed teams up with his girlfriend Trixie, his one-time rival, the mysterious Racer X, and shifty racer Taejo Togokhan to enter the Casa Cristo 5000 - known as ""The Crucible"" - in part of a plot to uncover the treacheries of Royalton and save the Racer business. That's all I'm tellin' you, folks.Anything else I would like to say about this film is that it is an excellent film, with thrilling action/adventure. Though I am still SHOCKED by the negativity towards it.",Speed Racer
68,gavin-thelordofthefu-48-460297,"An underrated and entertaining adaptation of a great classic TV show, even the critics will always be ignored!",8,11 May 2012,"To be greatly honest, I've never heard of this show until later, when my little brother owned a DVD copy which contained the first few episodes, I became very interested and watched it. And, what a shock, I was instantly surprised and I seemed to like it so much that later, I got a six-disc complete set of the show for Christmas that my mom gave to me and I was hyped as heck. I've watched some of the episodes (including the finale) and I understand why lots of anime fans love this show so much that in fact, I actually love this show as well.So, when I heard that Warner Brothers hired The Wachowski Brothers to direct a live-action movie adaptation of the show, I saw that lots of Speed Racer fans saw it and were excited at how it managed to capture the spirit and tone of the show perfectly, but the critics weren't completely satisfied since they complained about how the CGI seemed overdone and when it first came out, it was a failure at the box office making only 43 million domestic and only 93 million worldwide out of it's 120 million budget, but has then remained by fans of the show to be a cult classic for about four years since it's release.However, in my opinion, when I first saw it on a DVD copy that my cousin had, I did the best that I could think of: not listening to the critics because I think that this is an underrated and very entertaining adaptation of a great classic TV show. The characters looked exactly like the designs from the show and they were just right were we wanted them to be. The cast that portray the characters is excellent. Emile Hirsch did a fantastic job as the main character Speed Racer, Christina Ricci did an adequate job as Trixie. Other actors including John Goodman (got the part of Pops Racer just right), Susan Sarandon (got the part of Mom Racer right as well), Matthew Fox (exactly the right character for Racer X due to his emotions and the past where he pretending that he got in an accident), and Roger Allam (he made a fantastic love-to-hate villain Royalton) did a great job with their performances along with the annoying, yet likable little brother Spirtle Racer and his monkey friend Chim Cham.The story is like a mixture of the 50s, 60s, and 70s altogether with a quirky and very inspiring storyline about racing that could change a lot of ordinary people. The visuals are very colorful and looked exactly like the ones from the TV show. Even some top notch CGI effects on the cars and some great action in the driving sequences were awesome it would not only leave you speechless, but also breathless. Of course, there's the music from Michael Giacchino which is by far the most strongest aspect of the entire flick. It captures the same melodic and dramatic moments that made the show so enjoyable to watch it makes his greatest music as a composer (seeing as how he did some great music for ""The Incredibles"" and the later Pixar films ""Up"" and ""Cars 2"" along with Disney's new film John Carter, but I'm not going to spoil it for you). Heck, even the theme song by Ali Dee and the Deekompressors was epic and awesome!There are two problems that I do have with this movie. One of the scenes was a bit contrived, but not the worst and there are some times where the movie can be dragged due to it's non-action scenes, but I found the 2 hour to be very engaging. This movie also has some witty and smart Dialogue and some very hilarious moments.Overall, Speed Racer isn't a masterpiece by any means, but is no doubt an underrated cult favorite after four years have passed since the movie's release. Thumbs up!",Speed Racer
69,ghostfiendghost,Better than I thought,7,20 January 2019,"Yeah the monkey and kid suck

70,innocuous,Wow! Was the original anime series really that popular??,1,21 May 2008,"The only way that I can explain this movie getting any stars at all is that there must a significant number of baby-boomers seeking to recapture their youth in ANY manner possible. I'm only 53 years old and SR (the original anime series) was really more for my younger siblings. But I remember how awful it was. (It used to make me yearn for ""Clutch Cargo"" and ""Space Angel,"" where moving lips were imposed on basically static shots of the characters.) Well, this movie has not improved upon it one bit. The animation really does look a notch below that in ""Tron"" and is thrown at you in a seizure-inducing whirl. The plot makes no sense, which is OK, because you can't follow the action anyway.Once again, I have to lay the blame for a bad movie at the feet of gamers. The only possible explanation I have for the lousy CGI in this movie and for the startling editing is that too many people have come to accept (and expect) ""game graphics"" quality in their movies. At least ""Tron"" had an excuse for its primitive graphics...the story took place inside a video game. Here, with SR, it has to be as simple as the viewer getting what he will accept. In the case of this movie, that's not very much.Not recommended for anyone, and particularly not for anyone inclined towards seizures.",Speed Racer
71,moviesleuth2,There's nothing else like it!,8,16 April 2009,"There's a certain excitement I get when I see a two minute teaser trailer of a movie that's coming out a year or so from when I see the teaser. Part wonder, part anticipation...it's exhilarating. For a while I believe that anything can happen in this upcoming movie. It's almost like a really good dream. No matter how good the movie turns out to be, I've never seen a movie that kept that feeling flowing inside me. After a while, I thought it was one of those things that can only be imagined, but never attained.Then I saw ""Speed Racer..."" In short, ""Speed Racer"" is a wild ride. From the moment the swirling colors start and the Warner Brothers logo appears, ""Speed Racer"" hurtles by with an explosion of energy, and for 135 minutes, it keeps going at that level. ""Adrenaline Rush"" doesn't even begin to describe it.The Racer family (Pops, Mom, Rex, Speed, Spirtle) does what you think they do: race. But this isn't just going around in a circle...no, these race tracks are just like the arcade games: massive hills, steep slopes, breakneck curves, huge jumps. You name it, it's there. They run their own business racing, building their own cars, and Rex and Speed race them. But they face competition from Royalton, who makes Enron look law-abiding. Now Speed has to keep winning to expose the corruption that Royalton is causing.That may not make sense, but I left a lot out. In the end, it really doesn't matter. The Wachowski Brothers have always pushed the limits of special effects, and ""Speed Racer"" is no different. The visuals here are jaw-dropping. It's like walking into a video game, filled with bright colors and energetic action. The Wachowskis throw everything at their disposal onto the screen (and when I say everything, I mean EVERYTHING!). If there's a special effect that they can use, they use it. A lot of it is very innovative too, like how they mix crude drawings with real people so it looks like a real person is driving a car that a kid would draw. Anime fans will be pleased with how the characters glide across the screen like they do in the anime (this makes sense because that's where this originated from). The Wachowskis may have completely updated the cartoon, but they kept it alive in spirit.Acting takes second place to the visuals, but the performances are solid enough that they don't get drowned out. Emile Hirsch (Speed) continues to impress after his solid turn in ""Alpha Dog."" Christina Ricci is good as always as his plucky girlfriend Trixie. Roger Allam is a scene stealer as Royalton. He's as slimy as they get in a wonderfully over-the-top performance. John Goodman and Susan Sarandon (Mom and Pops Racer) may seem like odd choices in a movie like this, but they fit right in. Matthew Fox is suitably mysterious as Racer X. The other cast members, including Rain, Scott Porter, and Paulie Litt are solid as well.As good as the special effects are (and I'll say it again, they are VERY good), they're not perfect. There are times when it's obvious that the actors are in front of a green screen. It's distracting, and it takes the viewer out of the moment. Still, the camera changes so often that by the time we realize it, it's already done, and we're back in the middle of the show.Do yourself a favor: Go see ""Speed Racer."" You won't be disappointed. It's not every day that a family film contains more thrills than a year's worth of summer blockbusters combined.Note: Despite calling it a ""family film"" (even though it is suitable for the entire family), it really can be enjoyed by everyone, not just the kids.",Speed Racer
72,raypdaley182,Awful,1,11 May 2008,"If like me you know nothing about Speed Racer other than it's based on a comic & cartoon of the same name then like your almost certainly going to hate this film.Basically we follow a boy called Speed Racer (Wow, his parents must REALLY hate him to have named him Speed?) who is nothing but a dreamer with no focus who lives pretty much in his own imagination most of the time.Now if this were real life he'd be branded a retard or dosed up on Ritalin as he seems to be severely mentally disturbed. The film is far too cartoony in its appearance (in fact the 1st real racing sequence we see looks like a slot car toy racing set). In many ways the film looks too much like the games Wipeout & Wipeout 2097 in its race sequences and if I wanted to see those I'd simply go play the game so the film is very unoriginal there (actually at certain points in that race sequence the film looks like it had stolen heavily from the original Rollerball).For most people I'll be very surprised if watching the race sequences doesn't make them feel very nauseous indeed & if any vomit it wouldn't surprise me in the slightest.Without less than an hour having elapsed the film became impossible to follow. Was Rex dead or not? I gave up on the movie as it just too unbearable, weak plot pinning its hopes on showy images and vomit inducing race sequences. If I wanted to watch a film with better racing sequences than this that didn't make me feel like vomiting I'd watch Ben Hur & Days Of Thunder or the Pod race in Phantom Menace. At least I know watching them they have plots that aren't confusing you as to whether someone is actually alive or not.Avoid like crazy even if you are a fan. It's just plain AWFUL!",Speed Racer

75,loganx-2,Why Real Life And Cartoons Are Different Worlds,6,12 June 2008,"Visually this film is a wonderland of bright colors, flashing lights, jumping cars, manga swipes, Dr. Suess and Hot Wheels race tracks that, and chimps. Had I been 10 when this came out, it would easily be one of my favorite movies. As it is though,I'm a few years older, maybe too old for this movie. The Wachowski brothers instead of trying to make speed racer real, decided to go the opposite direction and make real life into the speed racer cartoon. The results are mixed, on the one hand, they bring to life the energy of the Mach 5 through it's psychedelic video game like race tracks, on the other hand it makes the scenes when Speed isn't racing almost unbearable.There's good cinematography throughout, even as characters discuss simple things, the images never seem to stop moving, everything is racing along. But actually having to endure real people speak exactly like 60's cartoon characters, is just... annoying. There's things like a warning for people who don't like cooties to turn away before an on screen kiss...that's a cute idea, funny if your young enough or in the right mood, but that kind of thing goes on throughout the movie, without the winking self-consciousness you get even in ""The Adams Family"", ""The Flinstones"" and ""Shrek"" movies, where some jokes are designed for children others targeted at adults, this is one is all aimed at the kids. While that's not a bad thing in and of itself, it just makes certain portions of this really, really drag. There's some nice morals in the story about believing in yourself and in your vision, no matter what evil corporations may tell you, but it's not enough to make you invested in anything other than the actual racing. In the end I think the Wachowski's made a few cool scenes, but not a whole movie that puts them together. I'm gonna give this a high score though, as far as children's films go, there's enough visual excitement here to kill an elephant if it was old and had a bad heart, so kids should like it, I know I would have...and kinda did.",Speed Racer

77,diac228,"Speed Racer is a wild, crazy trip through the color wheel...er, I mean...its an insane, colorful ride.",7,11 May 2008,"Speed Racer is an acid trip that you purchase with some popcorn and a drink. The film rushes at you with furious speeds, a very unique style, and enough colors to force you to take an eye exam at the end of it all. Speed Racer stays true to the television show, has a stellar cast of actors and actresses, has great action and driving set pieces, and to top it all off has a well-written musical score. However, in spite of the mayhem, there's still a major issue that bars this movie from being among the best summer flicks of the decade (this issue will be dwelled upon later). It's a shame to point out any flaws in this piece simply because of the obvious excruciating amount of time and effort provided. Despite the setbacks, the eye candy is set to the maximum level and pretty much resembles a PG-rated version of a previous movie from the Wachowski Brothers: The Matrix Reloaded---so much style, it overpowers the substance to a point that you neglect your brain.Plot? Oh yea, this has one. Basically, Speed Racer uses his insane talent as a successful, ruthless, and intelligent racecar driver to take on the corruption that is tainting the sport behind the scenes. Unfortunately, this might involve him in following his brother's footstepsa brother that died after an ugly crash. This quest for justice takes him to different parts of the world, and against dozens of enemies that want to destroy him, and pits him with a mysterious driver that has a driving style just like Speed's brother. The story itself is plentiful with action and substance, however it misses an audience. On one hand, you have the cheesy, easy-to-follow dialogue from the cartoon that gives it a campy attitude. Then on the other hand, we have the long monologues about business and stock prices, and that pretty much throws off all kids (and even some adults). Why is a PG flick even remotely discussing the stock market? Better yet, the PG rating is what kills Speed Racer. The film could have been an excellent flick for kids with adult themes buried underneath, like The Incredibles. Or, with a bit more rough and edgy material, we could have had a superb PG-13 action movie like Curse of the Black Pearl. Instead, we have a movie that tries to appeal to both, and ultimately slows down the film and confuses the audience. The potential of Speed Racer could have propelled it to quality levels of the original Matrix. Instead, we have tense, stylish races having to appear after an assortment of childish activities from a child and his monkey (it happens far too many times). All the kiddie material hampers the movie and drags the pacing to sometimes a halt (A joke about cooties? Are you kidding me?). The movie is over 130 minutes long, why is there only one race in the entire opening act? We came to see fast and furious racing, not to see a child sneak around a plane to steal candy.The movie shines brightest when the special effects are in full-gear. The Brothers may need some work on their direction outside the action pieces, but the races and fights themselves are jaw-dropping, fun to look at, and quite lengthy. The colors bleed all over the place and spill onto the action; whizzing close to, around, and even through the cars speeding by. The effects don't always look realistic, but this was to enhance and toy around with the style of the original anime, and it works perfectly. The strongest part of the movie was the final two races, when you've pretty much just spilled every food item you had in your arsenal because of all the jumping around occurring amongst the audience.Let's not forget the cast, either. The best performances in the movie were those of Matthew Fox and John Goodman (always, always reliable); whom played Racer X and Speed's father respectively. Christina Ricci does not look like Christina Ricci, but certainly does a great job playing Speed's girlfriend Trixie. Emile Hirsch (as Speed Racer) on the other hand didn't have much to work with (Like Ricci), but gets the job done. The worst performance comes from the youngest in the family (Paulie Litt), whose main purpose in the movie was to pretty much be the clownan annoying one at that. Sadly, Trixie and Racer X are underused main character well-known from the anime, while smaller characters like the monkey and Spirtle receive undeserving extra time.Bottom Line: Speed Racer is an incredible ride that could have been much better only if it hadn't tried so hard to appeal to a vast majority. Cutting away at the extensive dialogue about business or cutting away all the kiddie-silly moments would have made this a shorter, better movie. It is indeed hard to find the fine line between blending children content and adult content, and Speed Racer is good evidence of this. One would only imagine what would have happened if the Wachowski Brothers approached Pixar's creative writing staff about this project.However it is hard to criticize a film that delivered so much action and special effects that the edge of your seat starts wearing thin. This was the dilemma with Transformers; a 2007 blockbuster that meshed good action scenes with ridiculous dialogue, pacing, acting, and non-action material. Luckily for us and Speed Racer, the movie doesn't quite suffer extensively from this, just the identity crisis and inability to set its sights on one specific audience. Looking past this though and you'll find a fun, fun movie with excellent use of colors, imagery, and speed.P.S. (This is for you gamers): Upon watching this, now we know it's possible to create a darn good F-Zero film.",Speed Racer
78,xamtaro,"Speed Racer is ""Up-n-Flyin""",9,31 March 2009,"Personally, i was never a big Speed Racer fan. Bring a child of the 90s the only Speed Racer shows I've watched are the original when it was on re-runs in the months leading up to the movie's release and the CGI ""Speed racer: The Next generation"". My impressions about the Speed Racer anime were not too good. The animation was seriously crappy for starters, the acting and lines were campy, the story was only OK, the characters were one-dimensional, i could go on. So with much hesitation, my pals dragged my to watch Speed Racer the movie. 3 words ""This"" ""movie"" ""ROCKED"" It is a faithful adaptation of the original anime but it corrects many of the mistakes the anime made while keeping true to its family friendly roots. Many impressive pointers that i should mention about the show1) The story. Pure nostalgia. The story is simple enough to follow and it hearkens back to a simpler time, a more innocent time of candy and cartoons. The easy to follow story are blended with many thought provoking and heart warming themes. Simple, everyday moral themes like family togetherness, brotherly love and sticking by one's friends are interwoven with more complex themes like corporate manipulation, the philosophy of purpose, whether the means justify the ends, etc. On surface level, the story might seem just like the original aka simplistic, but dig deeper, give it a thought and a whole lot more springs into view.2) the characters. I don't know but in the original anime, i couldn't really feel for the characters. The way they are portrayed just left me feeling ""aloof"". Like I'm viewing everything as myself from a 3rd person perspective rather than being immersed in the essence of the various characters and experience what they experience. This movie corrects that flaw. Thanks to terrific acting, great casting, and excellent writing, the characters really shine. You could really watch this movie and forget that the people on screen are just characters. They come across as very real. The chemistry between Speed and the rest of his family is just so believable and earnest, its like the perfect small town family. Rex Racer's story is made particularly heart wrenching especially the effects his initial ""death"" had on his parents and brother(something that was seriously lacking in the original anime) and his internal anguish and regret for not telling Speed the truth about his identity as Racer X. The various comedic turns by Spritle and Chim Chim definitely do not seem out of place and in fact are very timely intercut with other more serious scenes to give the audience ""a break"" if you will from all that ""seriousness"" and remind them the movie is still fun. Even the ""villains"" like Royalton and Togokahn have a believable purpose for doing what they do. These more complex and manipulative antagonists are inter-spliced with simple cookie cutter villains in the form of the other dastardly racers. Once again this is done to allow the audience ""breathing room"". After all that thinking, its great to just sit back and have fun watching the devious racers try to off Speed and Taejo.3) The races and visuals. Defiantly a whole notch above the boring races in the original anime. Coupled with the special effects, everything is pure eye candy while retaining that nostalgic child-like touch in its colors. Gravity defying stunts, rapid drift spins and car against car action straight out of a cartoon onto the big screen will make anyone's inner mental child jump with excitement. The film definitely looks the part of a live action anime thanks to the timely cutting and insertion of typical anime filming touches like freeze frames, slo-mo cuts to close ups and superimposing of talking heads into the action. If the original anime was visually a masterpiece back in the 60s then this Speed racer movie is definitely a visual masterpiece of the new century.Overall The team that brought us Matrix and V for Vendetta lives up to the hype once again. The deliver a faithful big screen adaptation of a classic anime containing a well balanced blend of seriousness and fun, of thought provoking issues and heart warming performances. All the while retaining the child-like nostalgia of innocent times long past. This is not a movie that is in your face philosophical or seeking to win awards(which is what i think the critics expected). This is definitely a labour of love that doesn't seek to trail blaze into film-making future but looks back to the happier more innocent times of the past.What ever ""flaws""(i personally do not consider those points flaws) those film critics pointed out(like simplistic story, anti-capitalism, the campiness) were all elements present in the original anime. Keeping them in the movie just showed how true to the original the directors wanted to be. The poor performance at box offices, in my opinion, was due to the producers not pin pointing the right target audience. Thanks to lousy and inconsistent advertising, the show was marketed as a kids show, alienating the non-fan teenagers and adults. THe Kids will not be able to catch all the subtle themes and enjoy the full essence and spirit of the movie. This movie is definitely for only the open minded viewers and the long time fans(and seeing as how Speed racer is a VERY old show, and haven't been updating with the times like Transformers or gundam, its fan base is dwindling). All else would get lost in its world of swirling colors and explosive races.By far the best, most faithful, most enjoyable anime movie adaptation so far.",Speed Racer
79,daisukereds,I like Speed Racer,7,30 May 2021,"..both the original animation and the concept.This is a very good adaptation of the source material! They definitely got it, right down to the tone and type of content it is. It's not changed to be realistic, and it is certainly intentional.I love a good tournament story, and it has good development, twists and turns. Character interactions and even great lines and memorable dialogue. Most of the cast is GREAT! But the actor playing Speed.. he just doesn't fit the role. It's quite surprising to me that the movie works anyway! Probably because everyone else fits so well, and the story is so engrossing, you get lost in it. The look of the movie is something most people didn't and won't ever get behind, and I agree in parts (it could have been done better, like a Scott Pilgrim). The races are the heart of the movie and are what I look forward to on a re-watch (even skipping scenes to get to them faster).I love it, and I wish there was more of it.",Speed Racer
80,kgprophet,What were they thinking?,3,11 May 2008,"This movie is bad. It's ""Last Action Hero"" bad, it's Ang Lee's ""Hulk"" bad, it's ""Flinstones"" bad, it's ""Phantom Menace"" bad. I started to get that sinking feeling as the opening act failed to find it's groove, jumping all over the place without giving the audience a chance to ground themselves. Supposedly this is a movie made for youngsters. If this was true, they would know enough to keep the running time to about 90 minutes. I can guarantee you that if the studio required the Wachowski Bros to shorten the run time, this movie would have been much better. They also should have known that you can't keep up this flashy visual style for over two hours, for it becomes repetitious and loses it's effect on the audience. The worst thing you can ever do for a summer popcorn movie is have long long monologues. My God, it's not a contest to see how many words you can use to describe the racing business. What were they thinking as we are inundated with countless close-ups spewing subplot after subplot. After about an hour of this claptrap, I just gave up trying to keep track of who was in trouble, who was friendly, it just went on and on.The flashy editing didn't help with the racing sequences, because you are only given 1 second to figure out what's going on in a shot before it changes again. A few race sequences weren't fleshed out enough to get a sense of the endurance. We rarely see the actual start, and the flashy editing prevents you from keeping track of who is where, or whether they are winning.I gave this movie a shot by seeing it on Imax, but it just made the nose hairs bigger.Added 05/27/08: I am truly puzzled by the stark contrast in the reviews on IMDb. Many reviews were 10 stars and fawning over how perfect it is. I really can't see by any stretch of the imagination how this could be given a perfect score. Judging not only by the critical reviews but also the nearly empty theatres nationwide, it is NOT any kind of masterpiece. I am hesitant to guess, but perhaps these early reviews were planted? I was fooled in the past by early glowing reviews on IMDb (Swordfish comes to mind), and certainly am wary these days. Especially when the film is given 10 stars and described as if it is the most important achievement in movie-making. Speed Racer? I don't think so.",Speed Racer

His only real competition is the memory of the brother he idolized -- the legendary Rex Racer, whose death in a race has left behind a legacy that Speed is driven to fulfill. Speed is loyal to the family racing business, led by his father, Pops Racer (John Goodman), the designer of Speed's thundering Mach 5.When Speed turns down a lucrative and tempting offer from Royalton Industries, he not only infuriates the company's maniacal owner (Roger Allam) but uncovers a terrible secret -- some of the biggest races are being fixed by a handful of ruthless moguls who manipulate the top drivers to boost profits. If Speed won't drive for Royalton, Royalton will see to it that the Mach 5 never crosses another finish line.The only way for Speed to save his family's business and the sport he loves is to beat Royalton at his own game. With the support of his family and his loyal girlfriend, Trixie (Christina Ricci), Speed teams with his one-time rival -- the mysterious Racer X (Matthew Fox) -- to win the race that had taken his brother's life: the death-defying, cross-country rally known as The Crucible.

82,Scars_Remain,Hard to Sit Through,6,29 May 2008,"I kind of knew this film was going to be bad from the first time I saw the preview before Iron Man. I liked the original anime, Mahha GoGoGo, quite a bit but ultimately, I don't think it's the kind of cartoon that should be made into a live action movie. This movie is pretty much the equivalent of somebody eating an entire bowl skittles and then throwing it up on your face. The visuals are nice but less would definitely have been more. People who are prone to seizures, should stay away from this movie, as well as almost everyone else.I guess I can't complain about the acting because everyone had pretty solid performances but the script and dialog are awful so they really didn't have much to work with. I seriously wish they had spent more time on the script and less time trying to make the film look like a tye dye t-shirt on screen. There were only two things I actually enjoyed about this film and those were the visuals, even though there were too many of them and the ending scene was actually pretty good. It's too bad those didn't save the mess that this was.If you're into movie with incoherent story lines that are way too long and grueling, then Speed Racer is your cup of tea. Don't say you weren't warned!",Speed Racer
83,Dark_Lord_Mark,Speed Kills,10,8 September 2014,"This movie was a visual masterpiece, stunning. It may have scared some of the general public away at the box office because of it. Sci-fi movies have a tough climb unless it is emotionally based. Speed Racer was not sci-fi but the intense visuals turned a certain segment of the population off. I am trying to explain the failure at the box office for this movie,to be blunt the female audience and the fake nerd crowd stayed away.The acting was top notch and there was emotion when the character Speed is wondering about his brother and is he alive or not which was a great emotional backdrop to the entire movie. From the beginning you know it will be a fun movie with visuals ahead of its time, but I was blown away by the story, the GREAT acting and the visuals were something I have never seen; almost fantasy dream like similar to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory or Sky Captain.This is a superhero movie, except he's a race car driver named Speed Racer with emotional baggage and huge responsibilities. The big question is can Speed live and defeat his enemies.MUST SEE; A MOVIE WAY AHEAD OF ITS TIME!",Speed Racer
84,barrys82,Visually spectacular,7,18 May 2008,"Speed Racer is a movie that impacts you from the very first minute. A film that is full of action and adventure, very good twists, a little of romance and some very good moments of humor. With amazing CGI and spectacular special effects, Speed Racer only purpose is to entertain the crowd. The adaptation from the cartoon to the movie although it wasn't fully developed in my opinion, it is convincing enough. The cast is conformed by all-star actors. Emile Hirsch is very good as Speed Racer, he delivers a convincing performance. Christina Ricci in her first Blockbusterr movie since I don't remember when in the role of Trixie made a very good acting job. John Goodman and Susan Sarandon as Speed Racer's parents are excellent as well as Matthew Fox but the one who steals the movie with their humor is the little kid Paulie Litt and his chimpanzee. In conclusion, Speed Racer is the typical movie that sacrifices the story for spectacular effect and I think that it is why this movie is enjoyable and entertaining.",Speed Racer
85,curtis-8,What Were Those Brothers Thinking?,2,15 May 2008,"Who was it out there who thought that there was anything about this project that was a good idea? I mean, really? Who was this supposed to appeal to? The original cartoon has its nostalgia appeal, as well as some pretty heavy ""so bad it's fun"" irony/kitsch appeal. But those attributes are going to appeal mostly to adults old enough to remember the cartoon's syndication heyday. So why did they make the resulting film so childish? And I can't imagine the kid who could sit through 2 and a half hours of anything. Why is this thing so LONG? And is Speed Racer REALLY all the rage with today's kids or teens? Not that I've heard. And $100 million? Really? One Hundred Million to make a Speed Racer cartoon? (and despite the human faces and figures that pop up here and there, that's what this really is--just a CG cartoon). So in short:1) too bloated for kids, who aren't going to remember the original cartoon anyway. 2)too goofy, simplistic and loud for adults who might have been drawn in because they do remember the original 3)Why spend over $100 million to make a movie that any idiot could tell at the planning stages was not going to have a broad enough appeal to recoup the cost?Somebody explain it all to me!",Speed Racer

And the hyper-active editing and jelly bean colors tired me out early.If there was a story line here I couldn't find it.I looked forward to the races because when I was a kid (40 years ago when Speed first came out) the exciting thing was the tension in the races. What dangers? Who would try to sabotage Speed and how? Following the cartoon races was fun and easy. Not so much here. With constant close-ups, you never really knew what was happening overall in any of the races. I am so disappointed.This movie wasn't fun.I didn't like the fellow cast as Speed. He was super girlish and feminine to me. The rest of the cast really didn't have that much to do. Trixie disappears mid-way through. I guess a family-film anymore means high-jinx on sugar and mugging by a chimp.I won't add this DVD to my collection.I feel bad for the brothers, this is really their first major flop, It cost 120 mil to make plus 30-50 mil in advertising.

87,stormhawk2021,"Not a greatest movie, but entertains",6,19 June 2017,"Speed Racer is a film that upon initial release polarized audiences due to its story, performances, dialogue and visual style. However, visually, this film is a real treat. To be honest, I wasn't sure what to expect from this film, but I came out of it surprised. Speed Racer is a film that pure entertainment value from start to finish, if you enjoy films that are visually appealing, then this is a film for you. Sure, I agree that the film is over stylish, but that's a good thing. Although the script does seem a little rocky at times, the payoff comes in the races themselves. Overall this is a fun, entertaining film that is underrated, and it definitely deserves more praise just for the creativity alone. If you enjoy a good, effective and captivating picture, this film is worth seeing. Keep an open mind, it's a film that deserves much more recognition than it deserves. Sure, it's a flawless masterwork of cinema, but it's nonetheless a worthwhile and memorable viewing experience that anyone can enjoy if you're in the right frame of mind. The film's strong points are the visuals, races and overall look at the film, its flaws are in the dialogue and sometime cheesy performances, but really all that goes out the window because of its entertainment value. Speed Racer is a film that works well because its cast are good, and the direction is effective enough to grab your attention. Although it's not perfect, the film is well worth your time if you're looking for a pleasant visually charged time waster to watch. Upon seeing the film, I was surprised that mainstream critics couldn't see the merit in such a movie. Speed Racer deserves far more credit than it deserves, and most importantly, it deserves a second look.",Speed Racer

I wasn't about to waste the next two hours of my life watching this movie that should never have been made. The special effects look corny and aren't nearly as impressive as the ones in Transformers or most recently Terminator Salvation. The talented cast including Emile Hirsch, Christina Ricci, John Goodman, Susand Surandon, and Matthew Fox are entirely wasted in a movie that just isn't good at least not to me and I didn't even see the whole thing. The Wachowski brothers who made the The Matrix and it's two disappoint sequels continue a trend that M Night Shymalan seems to be going on lately that their newest movies are turning into major disappointments compared to their previous ones. No offense to either of them but this movie doesn't show their potential as directors if you want to see a good Wachowski brothers film see Bound or The Matrix. So I say skip Speed Racer because you'll be saving yourself the time and money. Save your time and money for a movie that will actually be worth seeing more than once.",Speed Racer
89,The_Amazing_Spy_Rises,"Pure popcorn fun for the whole family. Great job, Andy & Larry.",8,10 May 2008,"Well, what you've got here is a case of audience/critic disagreement. Obviously, this movie will get bashed by the critics because of its cartoonish and campy mood, but that's just it: the world shown on screen by the Wachowski brothers is marvelous. The animation is perfect for the atmosphere they're trying to create. Don't go in expecting Matrix-esquire effects, because there aren't any bullet time scenes. The effects used are so fitting for this movie because they're almost cartoonish and the movie doesn't take itself too seriously.The film, an adaptation of the long running Japanese anime, revolves around natural racing phenomenon Speed (the wonderful Emile Hirsch) and his family, which somehow includes John Goodman and Susan Sarandon (whoever pulled off this casting deserves some kind of award). Oh yeah, and the casting directors managed to get Matthew Fox and Christina Ricci as well. What really stood out in this area is that everyone involved really understood the characters and the world that Speed Racer is supposed to display. It's not supposed to be overly serious, nor is it supposed to be that realistic either. With the warm performances of Hirsch, Goodman, and Ricci, you get transported into another world (isn't that the point of movies anyway?). Matthew Fox is also great as the mysterious Racer X, whose role is sort of misconstrued by the previews. He showed a different side that I didn't think he could on 'Lost'.The visual effects, as I've said before, aren't going to be Matrix-esquire, but there are a few ""whoa"" factor sequences that had my jaw dropping. I also need to warn you that, if you can't take fast camera movements or rapid shots, be careful. It's not as bad as Cloverfield or Blair Witch (because the quickness only occurs in the race sequences), but I'd still try to grab a seat in the middle or back of the theater. The film is visually stunning outside of the races themselves as well. The buildings, the cities, the homes, the cars themselves...all beautiful.The Wachowski brothers get an A+ for keeping the movie in the spirit of the show as much as they could (they really did a great job), however the film has a major flaw: a runtime of just under 2 and a half hours. That's a BIG no no for a movie that is obviously marketed towards kids, unless it has the names ""Star Wars"" or ""Harry Potter"" on it. The film also has a sensual scene or two featuring Ricci and Hirsch, not to mention occasional language.My advice: don't listen to the critics, see this movie for the fact that it's pure entertainment for the audience, and it will take you away to a visually stunning world for a couple hours. Definitely an enjoyable movie for the entire family.",Speed Racer
90,Jay_Exiomo,Car crash after a wild spin,4,8 May 2008,"There's no doubt that ""Speed Racer"", the Wachowski brothers' version of a '60s anime series, is a visual spectacle. In fact, I've seen it on IMAX, which is probably the best way to see it (save for the occasional headache), but that's about it - a sugar rush with no real meat to chew on.Speed Racer(Emile Hirsch) has always been fascinated with racing as a child. He can't focus on his multiple choice exams and would rather go with his older brother Rex (Scott Porter) on the race track. But when Rex dies on one of the races, Speed comes into his own as a race car driver and eventually and attracts the attention of corporate giant boss, Royalton (Roger Allam). Speed is offered to work for Royalton Motors but turned it down due to conflict of interests. Speed races for the love of it, Royalton is into it for the money.Together with Speed's family - Pops Racer (John Goodman), Mom Racer (Susan Sarandon), younger brother Spirtle Racer (Paulie Litt), family chimp Chim Chim (played by two chimps), and girlfriend Trixie (Christina Ricci) - Speed goes the independent route. Together with new allies Racer X (Matthew Fox in what seems to be an early Cyclops costume) and Taejo Tokoghan (Korean pop sensation Rain), he now races to prove his worth, as well as to expose the corruption inside the racing system.All human aspects of the film quickly dissolve into the the brash and candy-colored world the Wachowskis have created rather aggressively. The races whiz into a blur, defying the laws of physics as a cartoon would, underscored by heavy effects painted in CGI. It may be fun in moderate doses but at over 2 hours, this visionary color palette-gone-wild is akin to gobbling up all the sugar from a jar, enough to hammer the audience's senses into overload.While these hyper-stimulations are interspersed with the obligatory dialogs for the characters to be truly ""humans"", it doesn't help that the story is too linear, with all emotional features bluntly added to blend in with the kaleidoscopic world. The drama doesn't work and the message rings false.""Speed Racer's"" overdone psychedelic nature may have been to evoke the kid in all of the audience. It's trying to go for that cartoonish look, after all. ""Eagerly"" trying, in fact. But throughout all the madness and the mayhem, the visual spectacle leaves one woozy, as if getting out of the theater is getting out of a car crash after a wild spin.",Speed Racer

So, they knew how to make a live action anime.Well, they got the style and the look right, but the story is not their strongest point.For a family film, the plot is very complex for a child. Do you think children know anything about The Stock Market, fixing races, corporations and gangsters? No. The Wachowskis didn't know how to write a family film. Their previous films were more aimed at an older audience and they thought if they take all the elements of the previous films without the violence, they would have a family film. No. It doesn't work.If you ask a child what the plot of this film is, they wouldn't have a clue what to say.The main reason this movie flopped was because it came out the same week as Iron Man. Also, it's not a film for epileptic people. AT ALL! But on DVD, it's found it's audience. And it looks fantastic on Blu Ray.The CGI is great and the look is bright and colourful. The Dragonball movie suffered from dull colours and was awfully boring. The dialogue is naff. Lines like ""I was working on cars whilst I was in diapers"" and all of Christina Ricci's lines like ""Hubba Hubba"" and ""Cool Beans"". Also Trixie doesn't have much of a role beside being the girlfriend.John Goodman plays the role of Papa Bear again, like he always does.

Go!,10,23 August 2008,"Of all the cartoon based live-action movies (which end up flopping in the box office and get crap from critics), this one seems to be the best and of them. This movie runs on star power and is family appropriate. It contains non-stop, fast-paced, action, adventure, romance and laughs (for the sake of the family). This mind blower is tells the origins of Speed and his fascination with racing and ends with the fact that racing is all about fun and sport, not for business. The film runs on star-power (with talents like Susan Surrandon and John Goodman as Mom and Pops Racer) and crazy special effects. It contains MATRIX-like action and crazy going- ons like you see on Cartoon Network. It looks like the video game, MARIO-KART DOUBLE- DASH. All the characters from the movie are all hyped up. I love the special effects, but I do no like the mischief little adventures of Sprittle (played by a real kid) and Chim-Chim (played by a real chimpanzee), because what gripes me that kids will get inspired by their antics and come up with ideas to drive people bananas. This is pure edge-of-your-seat action, that it is fun for the entire family. With this movie being a box-office success, what next? Eli Roth will make a film-adaptation of SESAME STREET?

The story follows the show pretty closely; the characters are picture perfect (""Pops"" has to be seen to be believed), the soundtrack is rousing, the plot is simple, yet, again, very close to the original cartoon. The moral message is short and sweet; and (what a complete surprise), family values are not frowned upon, but actually make the vast bulk of the movie.I can't imagine why critics hated it, but I don't expect The Wachowski Brothers to make another film in Hollywood for a long time.

""Speed Racer,"" an all too faithful adaptation of the 60's cartoon (ahem, anime) is in stark contrast to the Brothers' prior output, as a PG-rated, family friendly affair.Thankfully, the writer-director team's penchant for strong visuals has all but been toned down in the film. ""Speed Racer"" blurs the line between animation and live action, with mezmerizing visuals and insanely over-the-top racing sequences. More than just a cartoon come to life, though, the film is pulled down to Earth by its solid cast which includes Christina Ricci, John Goodman, Susan Sarandon, Roger Allam and Emile Hirsch as the title character.The story is fairly light on its feet, surprisingly. The main villain (Allam) serves as the catalyst for a race across the country that finds Speed Racer proving his family's worth as well as defending the sacred sport of racing. Despite the fact that the film forgets its plot somewhere in the middle and clocks in at well over two hours, the pacing is just right so that it never becomes a chore to sit through. The Wachowskis manage to, yet again, create a world that is easy to slip into, and ""Speed Racer"" is more than just a mindless car movie for kids (it can be, though), in fact, it's pure, unbridled escapism that begs you to leave your pretensions and preconceptions at the door.

Midway through the film I leaned over to him and whispered, ""What do you think?"" and this is what he said to me.""It's rubbish, man!""My Nephew was right as well. ""Speed Racer"" is very rubbish.I will admit that ""Speed Racer"" looks absolutely fabulous. It shows us a big, bright, day glow universe. A multi-coloured extrapolation of how somebody living in the 1950's would think that a car racing obsessed future would look like. Breathtaking production design.However... Other than the great visuals, ""Speed Racer"" is possibly the emptiest, shallowest, dullest movie experience I have had in a cinema, since my misfortune in shelling out a couple of quid to see ""The Matrix"" sequels. Very long and very boring. (Sorry guys, but a 2 hours and 15 minutes running time for a film aimed ostensibly at small children is way too much). ""Speed Racer"" is all glittering surface without a decent script underpinning it.Sigh... I know it's dull, but let's repeat the mantra once again, shall we?Special effects alone do not a good movie make.Personally I felt sorry for the cast in getting involved in such a clunker. Emile Hirsch had good notices in ""Into The Wild"" (I missed that one), and I thought he was funny in ""The Girl Next Door"", but here he is a personality vacuum and wears one expression of mild bemusement throughout the entire movie. Fine performers like Christina Ricci, John Goodman and Susan Sarandon are totally wasted. Lastly, the less said about Paulie Litt as Speed's irritating younger brother the better, and let's not mention the comedy chimp at all. Life is too short. (Whoops! Just did.)A bad misfire, then, but in recent times I have learnt to expect nothing much from the Wachowski's. ""The Matrix"" had it's moments (the first DVD I ever had, fact fans), but the best movie they were ever involved in was the lesbian film noir ""Bound"" and that was released way back in 1996. I would love the Wachowski's to do something as good again, but I doubt that they will. They have discovered the paintbox of digital special effects and, as long as those films continue to make money, I doubt they will ever want to close the lid on the paintbox.",Speed Racer
98,mr_popcorn,"McCheesy's take on ""Speed Racer""",6,20 May 2008,"If Speed Racer is a food, I betcha it will be delicious. The CGI looked very enticing you just wanna just eat it. The Wachowski's take on the hit 60's TV series 'Speed Racer' was rather enjoyable , the delish CGI really worked on the film's advantage and the actors, especially lead star Emile Hirsch, was above average. Though it was not a good career move for him as his follow-up to the critically acclaimed ""Into the Wild"", I'd probably say this film is delicious to look at but some are just bad after tastes. The way they handled the camera is so shaky its like watching Cloverfield all over again.The race sequences defies the basic principles of gravity and physics you will find yourself in toontown with Wile E. Coyote and the Roadrunner. That annoying kid and his pet chimp was just too annoying to watch and at some points in the film you'll find yourself in ""Did that just happen?!"" moments.The Wachowski's Speed Racer is all style and no substance. The kids will enjoy it, adults won't.6/10",Speed Racer
99,moutonbear25,Speed over Substance,7,13 May 2008,"A young Speed, as in Racer, sits at the back of his elementary school classroom, his foot practically tapping straight through the linoleum floor. It's not just that he can't sit still or focus on anything; it's worse than that. He may be there in that room but this is in a purely physical sense of the word. Speed is beyond the snail pace of every day life and the majority of the people that shuffle their feet to and from here and there while draped in blandness. Speed knows he's going to burn past everyone around him and he knows exactly how he's going to do it. Why then does he have to sit here and wait to figure it all out when he already has? It's as though the world is holding him back. Fire that starter gun already and get this race underway!Speed isn't the only one itching to get out of his seat. As soon as the kaleidoscope of candy coating colors graces the screen, the mysterious and revolutionary directing team known as the Wachowski Brothers (separately they are Andy and Larry), busts their remake of the popular 1960's Japanese anime, SPEED RACER, out of the gate and into the race. As the opening race erupts into an explosion of every bright color imaginable, it feels as though the Wachowski's are floating above it all and magically weaving all the elements together  from the extreme close-up's of wheels spinning to the character profiles wiping across the screen in transition  to create a new live action animation hybrid. The enthusiastic race crowd cheers with fervor as the now grown Speed Racer (Emile Hirsch) cruises past the competition and asserts himself as a genuine talent. Speed is seemingly unstoppable. Only, when the dust settles and the feeling of being immersed in a video game you've never played before comes to a halt, you realize the Wachowski's have gone on ahead without you.SPEED RACER most certainly solidifies the Wachowki's, the people who gave the world THE MATRIX  and nothing else since  as two of the most innovative filmmakers working today. Not only do they see things in a way that most of us only see in our dreams and forget once our eyes are open but they know how to put all the pieces together to make their visions a reality. The danger with being ahead of your time is that most everyone else is not. You run the risk then of creating something that may be genius in its own right but is rendered entirely meaningless if no one cares to bask in its glow. While the Wachowski's strive to get every detail just right, a task that would have been near impossible if it weren't for the talented cast, they slip off track without realizing. There seems to be more focus on orchestrating the elements that should amount to the appropriate level of fun instead of simple fun being had.I don't think the Wachowki's are the problem though. They truly outdid themselves visually with SPEED RACER. In a time when so many animated films attempt to look as realistic as possible, they decided to go against the traffic and make reality look entirely animated. I think the problem is the content. Recreating a cheaply animated series from another country and another era may be impressive from a visual standpoint but the content itself can be just as hollow as it once was if the translation never moves past the point of literal. Without anything of true substantial value to sink your teeth into, you're left with an abundance of sugar. While SPEED RACER is certainly sweet to start, your teeth may be slightly rotten by the time you cross the finish line.",Speed Racer
100,larry-411,Nonstop thrill ride from start to finish,7,8 May 2008,"The official Closing Night Gala of the 2008 Tribeca Film Festival was the World Premiere of ""Speed Racer,"" brothers Larry and Andy Wachowski's long-awaited big screen adaptation of the classic 60s cartoon. Directing from their own script, The Wachowski Brothers (as they are officially credited) have crafted a mind-numbing, stomach-turning experience which rivals those of the best theme parks in the world.Emile Hirsch (""Alpha Dog,"" ""Into the Wild"") takes on the role of Speed Racer, the iconic bad boy behind the wheel. His life has been shaped by the legacy of his older brother Rex and the guiding hand of his parents (John Goodman and Susan Sarandon). Pops runs a racing business and it's the only life Speed has ever known. Following in his brother's footsteps, making a name for himself, and fighting corruption in the business all bring Speed to a final showdown which will turn the racing world upside down, literally. With girlfriend Trixie (Christina Ricci), brother Spritle (Paulie Litt), and Spritle's trusted chimp Chim Chim by his side, he will cross paths with rival Racer X (Matthew Fox) and the diabolically twisted corporate mogul Royalton (Roger Allam) in ways he never imagined.Shot almost entirely using green screen, the performers rarely saw the settings in which they were acting and often didn't even interact with the other actors in their own scenes. That's quite daunting and all are to be saluted for rising to the challenge.Emile Hirsch is unsurpassed in all his work but almost seems out of place here. There is something jarring about a moving dramatic performance surrounded by cartoonish characters and settings. Still, the story, such as it is, would not be nearly as effective without his infusion of life into Speed. Christina Ricci, John Goodman, Susan Sarandon, and Matthew Fox likewise give it all they've got. Litt steals the show with every scene he's in and was an audience favorite -- the kids will absolutely adore him. Allam also surprises here, turning in a deliciously decadent Austin Powers-like performance which was perfectly in tune with the tone of the film. But the acting, however on point, is secondary to the action here.Production values, lighting, cinematography, and other technical aspects are somewhat moot as the film is really a CGI-based animated adventure more than a filmed narrative. There is no lighting or camera-work to speak of, per se. The apparent look, however, is lush and vibrant with bright pre-school colors and virtually continuous motion. Despite it's star-studded cast, ""Speed Racer"" might as well be an animated film which happens to have live people in the picture. But it is a nonstop thrill ride from opening title to closing credits. Rarely have I seen a film with such continuous action -- it literally leaves the viewer breathless at times. It's often difficult to follow that action, however, as it's mostly animated with such a rapid-fire pace and sense of relentless motion that the on screen images simply become a blur. But it's a true family-oriented film that both adults and kids will enjoy, and not a bad way to spend two hours on a weekend afternoon. Just be careful driving out of the parking lot.",Speed Racer
101,Dragoneyed363,An amazing film,8,20 October 2008,"I just loved Speed Racer. It did an amazing job at entertaining, and overall the movie blew me away altogether. The movie may have became a little idiotic and somewhat uninteresting at points, but they did a very good job on the script and I loved all the awesome kick-ass action. One of my favorite parts is when they are fighting in the hotel bedroom, that scene was awesome, and I laughed at a lot of the cute jokes too.I understand it was mostly all for thrills in the vision department, but that is what you should have been expecting when you went in to Overall Speed Racer exceeded my expectations, and in the end I was very glad I had the chance to view it, for I loved it and think it rises above a lot of other movies out there recently. It did not deserves it's Razzie noms. Give it one more chance if you did not like it.",Speed Racer
102,TheRadiobox,A movie just as greedy as its villains,5,8 September 2021,"Speed Racer was directed and written by the Wachowskis, who adapt from the animated series by Tatsuo Yoshida, and stars Emile Hirsch, Matthew Fox, John Goodman, Susan Sarandon, Christina Ricci, Paulie Litt, Benno Furmann, Rain, John Benfield, and Roger Allam. It's about a rookie race driver who aspires to win a championship and save the competition by doing so.The Plot: The Wachowskis try to pack as much into Speed Racer as they can, disregarding even the idea of trimming the fat in the film. From racing action to criminal conspiracy to familial sentiment to hokey dialogue, it's all here; which could be a good thing but there's too little balance of all these intentions. After the death of his brother and destruction of his family unit, Speed (Hirsch) has taken up his mantle and is sweeping the racing scene, so much so that he's getting sponsorship offers from people like Royalton (Allam), a powerful corporate figurehead. Because his family (Pops (Goodman), Mom (Sarandon), and Spirtle (Litt)) and love interest Trixie (Ricci) hate megacorporations like Royalton's, Speed declines, much to Royalton's chagrin. He for some reason reveals that he and others like him have been rigging races and attacks the Racer family. Speed gets more offers from more people related to the industry like Inspector Detector (Furmann) and Taejo (Rain) who offer to provide evidence of fraud, but surprisingly the movie goes the paranoid route and has Speed get burned all throughout by all types of people. While all of this is taking place, Speed is gearing up to race in the Casa Cristo against Racer X (Fox), Snake Oiler (Benfield), and others to take the title back for his family. It's a crammed plot to be sure, and several beats are contrived into being, but the different perspective is nice to see. With a tighter script and a different skin this all would've worked better as the bright colors and hyperactive visuals are more than a little contrast-y but the plot works decently on its own.The Characters: The quantity of different characters and relationships they have to others is far better suited to an adult-oriented movie, and the conversations they have about obligations to win to continue living don't befit the characters themselves who are one-dimensional archetypes. Speed is a one-track mind (get it?). He's always been interested in racing and everything it should bring, aspiring to fix the system on his own terms for the sake of his family and his lifestyle; and he's great at what he does. He's rather simple in that way but easy to identify with. Most of the Racer family is rather flat, with Pops the only one who gets any substantial development. He's always hated the control the corporations have over everything, which makes sense but there's never an inciting action shown to understand the point at which he began thinking the way he does. Everyone else directly related to Speed is basically filler and only exist to fit the name. Royalton is the most anachronistic, acting like an actual corporate suit but speaking like a cartoon. He's the best summary of the movie's issues in that he's endowed with legitimate criticisms but presented under the veneer of children's entertainment which eventually washes over him and drowns the message in bright colors and flashing lights. Racer X is at least more than just the ultimate obstacle for Speed since the Wachowskis sensibly give him a rebellious but dialed-in personality. If the directors made everything with that image in mind the characters, again, would've worked better.The Action: Like all things in Speed Racer, the action is a mixed bag. Parts of the major races are enjoyable action that resemble fights for survival than actual racing. When viewed from afar or from overhead angles the races are at their peak as there's a clear illustration of what's going on in the grand scheme of the race. However, when the movie is right there alongside the drivers, it again loses itself among the headache-inducing vibrancy of the color palette and some woeful greenscreen compositing where the only benefit the Speed Racer name has on the movie shows itself by giving the movie some leeway to look like an underfunded Nickelodeon sitcom. Still, the variety of locations and eventual weaponry are the best representations the Speed Racer IP could've hoped for. Since the Wachowskis directed this movie, there had to be some hand-to-hand combat, and in the couple scenes where the characters fight with their fists, the movie looked great. Turning down the saturation and throw in some coherent cinematography for decent mindless set pieces.The Technics: Speed Racer makes few attempts to balance its intentions, with an editorial jumpiness plaguing the runtime and darker scenes of real-world corruption pocked with a screaming kid and a monkey being the obvious bones to pick. During the few times the movie manages to find a niche for itself, there's enjoyment to be found in appreciating the work that went into the sound design and score, which are impressively detailed. Michael Giacchino's score perfectly captures the spirit of the cartoon and stands on its own as a supportive sound for the movie's plot. It does feel like the directors bit off more than they could chew in their handling of the narrative though. The plotlines that run throughout the entire movie could easily have been split and made into two completely different films, and as such, the pacing suffers. At times there will be an extended racing sequence suddenly interrupted by a cutaway to Royalton making deals with other racers and at other points the movie will launch into a flashback where a simple line of dialogue would've sufficed. Apparently a lot of work went into making Speed Racer, but this is one of those cases where the people behind it got carried away.A packed plot is fine on its own, as are vibrant visuals and quick editing; but Speed Racer has all of these things and more, making for a movie that wants to have it all and be for everyone. Instead it suffers from average characters, a solid story brought down by tone, and visuals that could cause burst blood vessels. It simply ends being an appreciable misfire.55/100.",Speed Racer
103,torrascotia,For the Hardcore Speed Racer Fans Only.,4,15 September 2018,"Its 2018 and I have finally managed to get round to watching this movie which was a massive bomb at the box office. I had managed to catch glimpses of this on TV and each time I wondered just what was going on with this bizarre looking CGI mess. Having checked the mixed reviews, its obvious that this movie does have its fans, so I decided to check it out in HD.
I have never watched the Speed Racer TV series, so I was judging this purely on the movie.
First off, while this is obviously a kids TV show it certainly doesn't play like a kids movie. Its far too long at 2hrs 15 min. Which is problematic as there are too many boring and repetitive scenes which could have ended up on the cutting room floor. 
It seems to have been a labour of love in that it looks like they have gone to the effort of making the movie as similar to the cartoon as possible. However when we have a superfan production team in charge of a franchise, this can lead to a movie overstuffed with content as they try to cram a number of TV series worth of material into a single movie, can bore the average movie watcher. 
There is simply too many weird talking head moments, its not necessary to see and hear four or five different commentators on a race, in different languages in succession at every race. Even describing this take up time. 
The GCI is ok in parts but when compared to something like Tron Legacies it looks rather cheap. 
We have a few A-list Hollywood actors in this movie and quite a few what appears B-list UK actors, its quite an unusual mix. 
The fans of this movie seem to be adults who grew up watching Speed Racer which is a shame as it really should be a kids movie that adults can also enjoy. I get the impression that while some of races may be interesting to kids the movie as a whole is likely too long, slow and boring to hold their interest for 2hrs 15 mins. I certainly struggled with it. 
Trim this to an essential 90 mins and there is likely an engaging movie for the masses.",Speed Racer
104,cnycitylady,'Speed Racer' is a fun ride,8,3 December 2014,"The Wachowski brothers have created movie gold with their feature film version of 'Speed Racer.' Based on the beloved cartoon, this movie encapsulates everything that was silly, heartwarming, mysterious and fun about the show. The characters are portrayed to perfection and the animation is both wacky and believable.The movie is a little over two hours long but the time just races by in sleek Mach 5s as Speed, Trixie and the gang go up against the evil racing corporations to prove that racing isn't a corporate business but a way of life--a sacred religion. The plot is well thought out and the script is hilarious. The acting is spot on and even the chimp is cute. Nothing about this movie is dour or stupid and the bad wrap that critics gave it come from short sighted old men who don't know what fun is, or how a good time translates on screen.I readily recommend this movie to fans of the show and those who have never seen/heard of it. Your eyes will be glued to the screen, too scared to blink for fear that you will miss even the tiniest of seconds of joy that this movie has to offer you.

105,frankenbenz,Crystal Meth for Liquid Crystal Displays,6,13 September 2008,"http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/Speed Racer, the Wachowski Brothers latest offering, is an attempt to remake an animated series into a live action movie that looks and feels like a cartoon in every way possible. There's little doubt the brothers behind The Matrix Trilogy are huge fans of Tatsuo Yoshida's classic 1960s-era hit and they go to great lengths to lovingly recreate Speed Racer's anime world, where real-world physics are as relevant as the truth is to John McCain's current presidential campaign. Few CG torch bearers go so far with green screens and computer generated visuals than SR and the end result is a movie that is so artificial it begs the question: why not just make an animated film?It would seem the ambitious Wachowski's were determined to do something unique, taking CG to a place where it would not only enhance visuals, but to be the vision unto itself. 1982's Tron not only beat the Wachowski's by over 25-years, it also trumps SR in creating a wholly unique CG world, a world that isn't just about the spectacle of a new and shiny, albeit alien, world.In all fairness to SR, it does make for a mildly entertaining ride and once you get past the realization that it's actually a movie for kids, then the one-dimensional archetypes, corny dialogue and CG overkill is almost excusable. Almost. While the movie does manage to pick up momentum after the oft-putting ramble of the first thirty minutes, it never manages to elevate itself beyond the trappings of its cartoon/CG world and characters. Yes the Wachowski's try very hard to inject SR with a more adult, anti-corporate theme, yet it, like the entire production, never rings true. Campy in way that borders on excess, SR does still manage to capture the essence of the animated series, although why Warner Bros. would invest $150 million in a campy remake of a Japanese cartoon is a question I'm sure a handful of execs will be forced to answer before they're fired.",Speed Racer

107,T-ZER0,"Speed Racer, the big headache",3,5 April 2020,"I am being honest. When I was a young kid, I loved this movie. I literally watched it all the time with my Dad and my brothers. I remember buying a ton of Hot Wheels toys and action figures from the movie, I also remember reading to Junior Novel and enjoying every race. To me, it was totally amazing because of the colors and the action. I thought it was the greatest racing movie/anime adaptation ever.But now, looking back. I was a young kid then, and I pretty much liked anything that had good effects and hardly any story. When I go back and watch this now, it's extremely cheesy, messy and overall just misguided. What do I mean by that?? Let's explain: Speed Racer is a movie adaption of the Classic anime that came out years before I was born, it's main character was Speed Racer in his famous Mach 5. He was constantly aided by his friend and Mechanic Sparky and his girlfriend Trixie.On this however, the Mach 5 is sadly not the focus of the film. Instead we get the Mach ""6""? And are introduced to a vehicle known as a T-180? Okay? You couldn't think of a better name?The movie seems keen on parodying everything from the original show. Sparky is not a smart friendly mechanic on this film. He's instead an older man who is brain dead stupid? Look at his horrible acting on the hotel scene, you'll see what I'm talking about. The Mammoth Car is not the same large car we remember from the cartoon, instead, it's a large bus. How uncreative!The Mach 5 is only used on a Rally Race called the Casa Cristo. Not for the final race which it should have been, but you know T-180 I guess. Speed himself is not very likeable as a character. Honestly, watch the scene when he's in the classroom as a kid and tell me you didn't cringe. Maybe I cringed because my younger brother would do the same things he did while homeschooling, but still, I don't want to see it again.Where's the Car Acrobatic Team or Captain Terror? Snake Oiler is in this one (great job on the casting guys, he looks great. 🙄) But his team is called Hyrda-Cell? What happened to Captain Terror, why is Snake Oiler an older dude? Is everybody older than Speed on this film??Who the heck is Royalton? I don't recall any Royalton on the old series, or mentioned at all. He's a pathetic excuse of a main antagonist. Being that his driver, Cannonball Taylor does not last the whole final race. The final race in the end has Speed facing off against two rivals that only had 7 minutes of screen time. Are they the main villains? Wait, is Speed the main villain for attacking them for just being there? God, this movie gives me a headache.Let's hear what the critics say:""Overloaded with headache-inducing special effects, Speed Racer finds the Wachowskis focused on visual thrills at the expense of a coherent storyline.""That's exactly how I feel! There's so much eye-candy on this film that there's not that much story! Every action scene is show in a certain animation that makes you think you're in an anime. If they wanted to go that route, why didn't they make the movie anime, and furthermore, there's so much women in this film. All just for eye-candy. This is one of the horniest films ever! 😂 The flag holders are women wearing skimpy outfits, close up shots of Royalton's assistant and flight attendant. The Queen of Casa Cristo is wearing a revealing outfit, there's literally a supporting attractive female character in almost every scene.Let's also mention that there's a considerable amount of unnecessary profanity in this cinematic mess. We all wanted to see Spritle give someone the finger right? That's something he would do in the anime right? Also, driving through a hallway on a cart at high speed injuring so many people is totally okay as long as they work for Royalton.I play the video game, because it's something I enjoyed with my cousins. But I do not enjoy this movie, I might further this review in a YouTube video, but for now. This movie is a sheer headache.",Speed Racer
108,joker-4,Disconcerting that the cartoon movie looked like a cartoon,6,25 September 2008,"SPEED RACER is an odd movie and was not properly marketed. When the project was finally greenlit and helmed by none other than the masters of the MATRIX, Gen-Xers everywhere anxiously awaited the pressing of the ""A"" button. What the Wachowski's provided, however, was a very-true-to-the-original recreation of the beloved show, a beloved show targeted to grade-schoolers, thus turning off those 30-something viewers but totally catching the attentions of their ADD children. Visually the film is both compelling and annoying with the largest distraction being the noticeably-fake, computer-generated backdrops. The Wachowskis and their art department certainly performed wonders on the strict use of primary colors keeping in line with the show they so desperately wanted to emulate. The casting, as well, was total aces as the actors took on the characters' actual appearances: Pops, Mom and Spritle especially. On the downside, the overall fake look of the film detracts the audience from experiencing a live- action movie as just that. Instead flesh-and-blood actors must interact with a reality that is truly not their own  more HOW THE GRINCH STOLE Christmas and less COOL WORLD. Having such occur is not unknown in the modern era of digital film-making as George Lucas and Robert Rodriguez, to name just two, have done similar feats. But where SPEED RACER differs from something like EPISODE I: THE PHANTOM MENACE is that even though the Pod Racers were CG, they looked real. The CG work in SPEED RACER  especially the disappointing race scenes  came across as nothing more than a typical, ordinary video game. Working in purely digital environment did allow the Wachowskis to play around with their camera work. Now that ""Bullet Time"" is passé, they brought a fluid sense of movement that allowed not-so-much the viewer to be part of the race, but, rather, to be a fly buzzing around the various characters and dialogue taking place.Hyper-kinetic and simplistic in plot, SPEED RACER, unfortunately, falls into lame sub-plots and childish commentary that, coupled with the aforementioned ersatz surroundings, makes a long movie all the longer disappointing those fans who were awaiting GRAND PRIX with a Trixie instead of Eva Marie Saint.",Speed Racer
109,simonparker1990,You will feel the need for Speed!,10,10 May 2008,"First off I have to point out that not everybody is going to approve of my review, Speed Racer is a movie that people will either love or loathe. If you loathe the film no doubt people will complain about the over the top acting, the cartoony look of the film, the campness, the cheesiness and loads of other things. No this is not the film everybody will go in expecting, but if you are like me you will be sucked into an incredible looking movie, with cool as hell race sequences, superb comedic timing and just a sense of fun unfortunately lacking in so many movies of late. I went into this movie with mixed feelings, sure the special effects looked great, but nothing else stood out, it all looked so force and just a but naff. And to be honest the movie is a bit naff, but its the naffness that makes it so brilliant. This is a living, breathing cartoon, nothing more nothing less. The Wachowski's (of Matrix fame) have given a cartoon background real actors. Surprisingly it works, sure some of the sets seem taken straight out of Cat in the Hat, but unlike that awful movie this works. Yet where the film really, really works is in the absolutely incredible race sequences. Words cannot express just how brilliant they are, the special effects in the trailer are a mere hint of what you see in the movie, the bright colours assault your eyeballs as the cars crash, jump, fight and practically dance all over the screen. The three major race sequences are incredible and the major reason why people should see this movie.Yet talking about the races being incredible isn't doing justice for the cast, who also do an extremely good job. Emile Hirsch is fast becoming a very talented actor, and once again he gives a good performance here. His smaller moments work a treat, but once he's in the car his character seems to come alive and you can see the excitement as he drives. Susan Sarandon and John Goodman do a superb job as the parents, taking two dimensional characters and making them surprisingly believable. John Goodman seems on top form as the dad, a multi-layered character who at times seems sympathetic, yet also quite nasty as well. Goodman delivers a proper performance, not like his sleepwalk through Evan Almighty. Sarandon also does a great job, she's unfortunately underused, but her moments with Hirsch verge on touching. Matthew Fox surprised me most in the movie, as a Lost fan even I can admit Matthew Fox is incredibly boring, but here he seems to be having a blast. He delivers lines perfectly, and even underneath his stupid looking outfit he does a great job. Last but not least is Cristina Ricci as the girlfriend, Trixie. Ricci delivers her usual routine, a very good performance with bundles of fun and energy to spare. Her character gets a lot better towards the end, and even has a few great action moments as well. Oh and Roger Allam finally gets an extended role in a movie as the chief villain, Royalton. He's absolutely brilliant and I can't wait to see him as more villains in the future, he delivers his lines with pure venom, and his ""won't even finish the race"" dialogue just works so well.As I have previously mentioned this movie is not for everyone. Most people will acknowledge the races look brilliant, but a lot of people will be turned off by the cartoon style. In many ways this comes across as a much more expensive Spy Kids 3-d. The race sequences being kind of similar. The comedy in the movie is also very much not for many people. Sure the humour isn't exactly mature, a monkey throwing poop for example is something you will either laugh at or sigh at. I personally enjoyed the immaturity of it all, its refreshing to have something light, fluffy and downright silly to watch. The fight sequence involving John Goodman is classic and made me laugh, but I'm aware some people will miss the highly choreographed fight sequences the Wachowski's made their trademark in The Matrix trilogy. The movie is a perfect length, never feeling too long, in fact the movie went by extremely quickly in my eyes, possibly because I was completely gripped and the last half hour features two incredible race sequences, the last of which actually had me sitting on the edge of my seat.Speed Racer is a movie that is completely like nothing you have seen before, it is commendable for Wachowki's for trying something so different. After The Matrix Revolutions my faith in them had been lost, but after this cinematic extravaganza my faith is restored. Watch the movie but expect to love it or loathe it. For this movie there really is no middle ground.",Speed Racer
110,Animus,"a faithful remake, and thats the real problem",3,27 September 2008,"I am one of the viewers old enough to remember seeing the original series on TV. It was a very cheap Japanese import series with very cheap voice dubbing. The animated TV series was aimed at boys age 5-7 and sadly the new movie has the same target audience. Visually stunning, the movie's plot is not terrible but it's only got one clever plot twist that simply exists to make sure we get another race in before the credits roll. The ""secret"" identity of Racer X is about as well kept in the movie as it was in the series, if you made it past the 3rd grade then you'll know who he is behind the mask in about 5 minutes. Sadly while its a beautiful movie to see, it's hard to actually watch because it feels like a 2 hour racing game. The stunts (if they can be called that since they are all CGI) look spectacular, but the characters make Boris and Natasha seem layered by comparison. Also if you have any risk of epileptic seizures this movie is not for you, lots of bright flashing lights and fast moving color pattens so be careful.",Speed Racer
111,Mike_Noga,Too bad none of the critics were kids. Dumb critics!,7,12 May 2008,"I took my 4 year old nephew to see this over the weekend because he too saw the commercials and has been dying to see It. He's at an age where he's really into cars, as well as fire engines and trains, and I thought this was right up his alley. I was right. He loved it. It was fast, it was exciting and it was fun for kids. Speed's little brother Sprital and his pet chimp Chim-Chim cracked up every kid in the theater and I have to admit they were pretty funny. The scene where Sprital is offered all the candy he wants made every kid laugh hard. It was creative in ways I would never think of and interesting for both kids and adults. There was a nice little message about family and integrity too. The portrayal of young Speed and his love of racing and his older brother was excellent. One of the best quiet little parts was when lil' Speed gets picked up from school by his big brother, in the Mach 5! What kid wouldn't love that? I don't get why people are saying there is no heart in this movie. It has plenty.I ended up liking the Racer family more in this movie than I ever did in the cartoon. While there are a couple of fight scenes they are more actiony than violent or vicious. Again, Sprital and Chim-Chim leaven the fights with humor.I don't know why the critics have their undies in a bunch over this one. It's plenty entertaining. Maybe someone should post a review from a 5 year old.If you're interested in this one at all you really have to see it in the biggest loudest theater possible. Any less and you're doing yourself a disservice. It was definitely made to be seen on a big screen.One more thing, this was my nephew's first experience seeing a movie in a theater. He was excited all week about seeing it and loved it all. He loved buying the popcorn, he loved handing the ticket to the usher(like a big kid), he picked up on the excitement of sitting in a huge auditorium with a big murmuring crowd. He loved the movie and he liked talking about it afterwards. And he was a well behaved little guy,especially after I explained to him that we can't talk during the movie because other people might not be able to hear the movie. He'd never seen previews before. There is no way I can remember what that was like. When I explained what they were he got excited about seeing The Hulk.I think he just might be a movie lover, or maybe I'm just a doddering old uncle.Anyhow, check out this movie for no other reason than you get to see a chimp de-pants a ninja.",Speed Racer

He thought it would be the best movie ever.He was bored. Definitely he was very disappointed. The special effects were good, although I just didn't care. The writing was painful. The acting was awful. The only thing they had going for them is that the cast actually resembled how I remember Speed Racer, especially Pops.If the original cartoon is out there, watch it instead. This was really dull. Not even a huge tub of popcorn and Dolby sound can salvage this one.",Speed Racer
113,Cocacolaguy912-2,It is what I expected...I suppose.,7,18 May 2008,"I went into 'Speed Racer' with low expectations. I didn't expect to be good at what it was trying to do, but nothing more.But the main reason Speed Racer works for me is because it was so ridiculously over-the-top. I knew this film would be crazy, but everything about this film just seems blown out of proportion. The lines, the shots, the acting, everything is just so ridiculous...almost to the point of hilarious...Another thing that I must address is the mix of live-action and animation. In all fairness, it reminds me of Mary Poppins. Characters dancing and then animation inserted. It is charming but it looks bad. I am not quite sure what to think of Speed Racer as far as action goes.But perhaps a flaw with the film that is actually bad is that I have no idea who this film is being aimed at. Little kids will enjoy the action sequences, but will they enjoy them every now and then for 125 minutes? And they will not understand the plot, which does actually exist.Not sure what to say, 7/10.",Speed Racer
114,commandercool88,A psychedelic ride worth hopping onto.,7,7 July 2008,"'Speed Racer' is NASCAR on crack. And it's actually entertaining. Based off of the classic anime, the Wachowski brothers have manufactured a wildly original and visually dazzling piece of candy that, above all else, is fun. Speed bumps hinder 'Racer' from reaching top speed, but what it lacks is made up for in good-hearted, adrenaline-pumping excitement. Not a movie strictly for the kids, but for the kid at heart? Definitely.'Speed Racer' reminded me what it was like to be a kid in a candy store. A flamboyantly colorful candy store. Flashing lights, frantic action, hyperactive colors. 'Racer' won't induce seizures, but it will keep you spell-binded in visual awe. When Speed Racer puts his Mach 5 into full-speed along those glimmering race tracks or cross-continent through adventurous terrain, 'Racer' is one of the best of its kind. A visual feast with plenty to go around.Unfortunately, what ultimately keeps 'Speed Racer' from greatness are the Wachowski's attention to style over substance. Had enough attention been paid to the script as it was for its technically savvy effects, 'Racer' would have been the complete package. A sugar high without the crash. The story is certainly there, and at times overly convoluted that will test the attention span of youngsters, but a weak script causes the picture unneeded weight at inopportune times. Long-winded speeches don't necessarily help the cause as we eagerly await the next acid trip. Race, I mean.Featuring a great cast, the stars of 'Speed Racer' take a supporting role to the cotton candy visuals that help make 'Racer' a mostly sweet concoction of childhood wonderment, and for good reason. But rather phone in their roles, the actors do put in an effort, which only reinforces the film's need for a developed script. Emile Hirsch, who after delivering a powerfully dynamic performance in 'Into the Wild', makes a solid if one-note appearance here in the starring role. Christina Ricci is surprisingly good, while Matthew Fox is not, but the reliable John Goodman and Susan Sarandon get by. But the Wachowski's are quick to remind us who the true stars of 'Racer' truly are: the entire color spectrum.'Speed Racer' is an affectionately campy ride, neither as good as I had hoped or as bad as I feared. Visually, fewer films are more accomplished. And it's where credit is certainly due. It's an amazing treat for the kid in all of us, and it's all about letting go and allowing yourself to be whisked away to a handsomely wrapped world courtesy of the Wachowski brothers. An awe-inspiring and life-affirming climax strikes the perfect chord, and it was enough for me to walk away with a smile on my face. Though far from perfect, 'Speed Racer' is a psychedelic ride worth hopping onto.More reviews at rottentomatoes.com/vine/journal_view.php?journalid=219276&view=public",Speed Racer
115,sjarja,wonderfully colourful,8,16 December 2014,"As an adult, i want to describe the movie as a non stop trip on drugs. It is fast, it is a blur of colours, it has a simplistic story (well, in a good way).For a kid, it might all be a little too much - too much hyper, but it is a roller-coaster ride with its very own style from what i can tell.Artistically, it is one of the best or most unique and successful adaptations from comic/animation to - well... lets call it live action for what its worth.This is a mindless movie - but for me it was some 2 hours that were anything but boring - and that considering that i do not like cars, racing, kids in movies - and i especially hate monkeys (in movies and RL)",Speed Racer
116,boe_dye,boe_dye Sez: It looks like a rainbow exploded onto the film! Wicked!,10,15 May 2008,"First off to all the people who didn't like it...Get over it, it followed the cartoon perfectly. Seriously, all the elements that made the cartoon, the original cartoon, the comic book, and the cartoon in the 90's were in this film. The Mach 5 and the Mach 6 (yes there really was a Mach 6 boys and girls).It was just a brilliant film.Now admittedly the beginning was a trifle slow. I found myself thinking, ""I really wanted to like this film too... :-("".But once it got rolling, I really enjoyed myself. Now be warned, it is incredibly colorful, and it is more geared towards children. Some people might not dig that sort of thing, but if you can dig a retelling of a children's classic anime, then you'll be alright...Did I mention that it was colorful? I mean, were not talking a few bright lights. We're talking a skittles factory bright. We're talking mesmerizing bright shiny, color cell rainbowy goodness! I think that the best way to describe this film would be to say that it was like watching Mario Kart. If any of you have ever played Mario Kart, this film was in a lot of ways like that. Mario Kart 64 meets F-Zero64, that's what it felt like.And the story line was pretty decent too. Granted were not talking epic Grammy worthy dialogue, but a fun enjoyable story line that everyone can get.Normally whenever a cartoon is translated into a live action film, a lot is lost in translation. However the Brothers Wachowski seem to have this ability and an eye for interpretation. One thing that impressed me was how much the cast looked exactly like their anime counterparts.One scene in particular that comes to mind is where you see a side shot of Speed talking to Racer X, and the Japanese guy. Emile Hirsch looks exactly, and i mean EXACTLY like the original Speed Racer.This movie was spectacular and fun, and just a blast. My wife enjoyed it. Secret Agent J enjoyed it. I enjoyed it! Don't go into it expecting some redneck, hillbilly, white trash redneck racing. This isn't Nascar, with a bunch of beer drinking git'r done hicks. This is very euro style, anime story telling.Keep that in mind my fellow American's if you are bold enough to see it.",Speed Racer
117,justbob1982,"A hyperactive riot of colour, and tremendously fun with it.",8,28 June 2014,"Version I watched: UK Bluray releaseActors: 6/10Plot/script: 6/10Photography/visual style: 9/10Music/score: 6/10Overall: 8/10Directed by the Wachowski Brothers (now brother and sister) of Matrix fame, Speed Racer is like Haribo sweets: a high-energy, saccharine instant buzz, presented in easy-to-swallow bite-size chunks. It is also the most fun I have had watching a film this year.The plot of the movie adapted from a well-remembered 60s anime series certainly doesn't pack any surprises, being a straightforward parade of by-the-book clichés presented in the correct order for your entertainment, but that is part of the charm. Many of the actors even seem to be chosen for their resemblance to key narrative archetypes. Emile Hirsch as the titular boy racer is the picture of a clean-cut, fresh-faced young man. Matthew Fox is the lantern-jawed mysterious stranger. John Goodman is the roundish-faced paternal figure, Roger Allam the jowly, sneering industrialist fat-cat, Christina Ricci the huge-eyed, supportive best friend and love interest.All this is okay because it is a framework on which to hang the dazzling visuals and thrill-ride action scenes. Everything is turned up to 11, with the constraints of real-life physics tossed negligently out of the window without a second thought.Speed Racer fits into the recent trend for super-sincere films (Enchanted, The Lego Movie, television's My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic) that succeed by their sheer absence of irony to suggest an underlying irony which was a source of constant hilarity. I laughed all the way through Speed Racer, every time something so ridiculous and yet so obvious happened, or at incidents that were so twee and clichéd that one simply cannot believe that anyone would use them with genuine sincerity any more.Even bits of dodgy CGI only improved the watch, providing more things to laugh at while enhancing the sense of unreality, of escapist fantasy. The distinction is sometimes made between laughing 'with' someone and laughing 'at' them, but Speed Racer blurs that line.It may not be deep or clever (at least not in the way some other films are lauded for being), but it is an absolute joy to watch. Ideally, put it in a double-bill with 2009's Redline for a full evening of frenetic, colour-suffused fun.For my full review, see my independent film blog on Blogspot, Cinema Inferno: http://cinemainferno-blog.blogspot.co.uk",Speed Racer
118,the_Poppuns,"Not really my thing, however",6,9 May 2008,"I can tell for those people who do like this sort of thing it's just what they would want. What the Wachowskis did here is obviously exactly what they meant to do. I barely remember 'Speed Racer' from when I was a kid and while watching movies, I usually mentally check out during car chases. I just don't get them. So for me, seeing something like this is kind of a bad idea. I went because it's one of the big pictures this year and Matthew Fox and Hiroyuki Sanada (who I love) were in the cast. So it wasn't meant for me, and I'm not surprised that I'm coming home with a little bit of a car chase hangover.But if you like car chases, for instance the podraces from 'The Phantom Menace' or the chase after that changeling in 'Attack of the Clones', this movie should totally be your speed. The story is interesting enough. And there were international stars sprinkled throughout so that there should be something in it for a lot of movie fandom. It's very fast paced and the art direction is dazzling, and I think it's something that should keep the kids busy for a few hours at least.You have really good actors in the cast, a kid who is the new version of Corey Feldman, and a chimp. The chimp steals some scenes, I have to tell you. My only gripe about the cast would be to question why they hired that guy instead of Tim Curry. You'll understand who I mean when you see it. But you know, it's exactly what it looks like it is. If it looks to you like you will like it then you will. It's extremely frenetic so if you're looking for a calming film, this isn't it. This is a cinematic sugar rush.",Speed Racer

Well, the cast delivered big-time, and the race sequences were when i give myself a break from the two-hour-plus running time. All in all, this is another clever outing by the brilliant Wachowski brothers. It's part spoof-cum-satire, part surreal animation and basically loads of fun (think zany Coen brothers meet zany Tim Burton, style-wise). Inspired by the 1960s Japanese anime classic Mach Go Go Go, the story is about a young racer haunted by the mysterious death of the brother he idolizes and how he and his family eventually take on the industry big players who have been controlling the racing scene for too long.Among the delicious cast members are Emile Hirsch who scores as the hero-protagonist; John Goodman and Susan Sarandon both spot-on as the supportive parents; Christina Ricci as the gung-ho girlfriend; as well as both Matthew Fox and Rain in sexy mode as fellow racers. Oh yes, and there's even a cute chimp getting in on the act too.A feel-good movie that transports you into a visually dazzling world filled with top-gear action.",Speed Racer
120,greggman,Liked it way more than I was expecting,8,18 November 2008,"I wanted to hate this movie. I'm loved the originals as a kid and when I saw the trailers with this futurist world with racing that looks like the F-Zero video game I refused to see it when it was in the theaters.But, I broke down one day with nothing else on my list and what can I say, I thoroughly loved it! I loved it so much I immediately bought the blu-ray and have since watched it at least 4 times. Every time enjoying it and having a big smile on my face at the end.Sure the space tracks weren't anything from the original but the race in the middle race was right out of the cartoons and overall it did a great job of reminding me off all kinds of details about the original. On top of that it was fun to watch and a good story as well.It might be a little violent for some but I'm personally glad they didn't remove the violence because the original was violent as well.Check it out if you haven't already.

Sure, the animation wasn't the greatest, nor the voice talent, but Speed Racer himself the colorful villains and especially, the Mach 5 were just so cool.I really want to say the new movie is great, but I can't. I do appreciate it, much like some classical music I don't care much for.The problem with this movie is that although it features some revolutionary storytelling, it's essentially a joyless exercise in visionary overindulgence. The CGI environment created for the film is at first mind blowing, then beautiful and finally oppressive. I found myself longing for a breath of fresh air as I watched the story progress.The story, like the Matrix sequels is dense, complicated and frustrating, requiring the villain to go on explaining things for what seems like 15 minutes at one point. This is too much for a children's film or one that's supposed to speak to the child within.The actors do their best with John Goodman as Pops Racer standing out. Emile Hirsch has a bright future, but only brings Speed Racer alive during the final confusing race.I said earlier I appreciated the film. because I understood just what Speed was racing against at the end, and the scope of his victory. Sadly, my understanding was intellectual. I got it, but felt nothing.So, Speed Racer, while not a failure is not a movie I can recommend.",Speed Racer
122,pazu7,Kung fu cars! Mega fun and a touch of nostalgia! (short and spoiler free),7,10 May 2008,"The Wachowski's have done it again! Mega-fun and unique. I'll admit I was a bit concerned during the first 15 minutes or so. The film starts out a bit jumpy as they establish back story, and the humor and animation seems slightly askew... as if they weren't sure if they were going for a live or animated feel. It also seemed that I was the only one laughing at the little gags, the adaptation of the characters and the way certain shots were cropped to mimic early anime's unique style. My concern was that the film seemed at first to be relying too much on inside jokes and that perhaps to people who had not been a fan of the cartoon, (as I had too many years ago than I care to count) it might come off goofy.... because Speed Racer is kinda goofy in the way that a lot of that early anime for kids was kinda goofy and fun! But that of course was the joke and my concerns were short lived.What the brothers have done with Speed Racer is to capture the essence of the cartoon and have fun with it without making fun of it.... sort of like Tarantino did with the action genre' in Kill Bill and Pulp Fiction ... but G-Rated of course... because it is still a kids show. The film takes anime's unique character and places into a brand new motif that is, at once, a mimicry of the form but also completely and distinctively its own. As events unfolded I found myself as immersed as I had been 4 decades ago when I would race home from school in order to catch Speed and Astro and Johnny Quest before I was obliged to finish my homework.The racing scenes are over-the-top hilarity and as frenetic as a Jackie Chan fight sequence... more so actually. And true to form the brothers make their signature social commentary and layer it so smoothly into the plot that it never becomes obtrusive.It would help to be familiar with the cartoon for most of the gags to make sense, but this film works either way... and is definitely kid friendly.",Speed Racer

It's a pretty kid oriented film, and some of the humor is childish and stupid, I'll admit that. But it does an excellent job telling the story of the Racer family and is very well told. I grew up with Hot Wheels and Speed Racer cartoons, and this movie has a special place in my heart.

124,moonmonday,Immense Wasted Potential,2,29 June 2009,"It's particularly astonishing when so many talented people can get together and make something that is so unexceptional, even astonishingly despicable, as Speed Racer. Not particularly faithful to the original animation, it nonetheless does a fantastic job in the visual department, communicating an amazing and compelling comic-book impact.Unfortunately, that is where it stops.With the immense talent and well-known ability found in this film, one would go into it expecting something miraculous. However, what one comes away from it with is a miserable, dismal film wherein the CGI sequences are the only ones worth seeing. It is especially disappointing, given the sheer talent assembled for the film. It was a film that appeals for the earnest performances and yet inspires deep contempt for the lacking script and contemptuously bad writing. Every actor, minus Matthew Fox and Emile Hirsch, make the best of their roles. Paulie Litt and John Goodman are especially noteworthy as amusing, in an otherwise dour cast.The film itself is depressing and downbeat, and as someone who has suffered the loss of those dear to me more than once, I find large parts of the script absolutely deplorable for their elements of sadistic cruelty. Racer X is completely unsympathetic and disgusting, especially after the resolution made his masquerade irrelevant. At virtually every turn, the film's plot makes one imagine that the world of racing is unhappy indeed, which is not really something that should be conveyed by a film so bright and visually compelling. Sadly it seems that the directors wished to contrast the inspiring visual impact with scriptual depression.The unhappiness of the entire production makes the funner sequences with Spritle and Chim Chim less amusing, although Spritle is the only one who adequately conveys the audience's emotion. Everyone else is pushed through the script's demands, and not with the energy that the visuals would seem to require. Speed and Trixie have no chemistry whatsoever, and nobody is actually anticipating their much-avoided kiss. Similarly, Racer X is neither compelling nor sympathetic, and by the end not a single viewer could possibly be moved by any revelation -- which was predictable anyway -- regarding his identity. Overall no emotional response makes any difference or any impact whatsoever, and that is the greatest tragedy of all in such a film, which attempts so fervently to be emotional: it is not moving in the slightest.What one has, without the racing sequences, is a depressing, disappointing, sickening family drama that attempts to be more of a feel-good film than it ever achieves. A film this colorful should not be nearly as depressing or as downcast, but it is. This is one cinematic work that should be avoided at all costs, unless the viewer mutes it and simply drinks in the undeniably excellent visuals. That is the only even remotely decent part of it: the visual impact is amazing, and that cannot be denied. The rest of it may be discarded without worry of losing anything of value.",Speed Racer

I haven't watched the TV show but i can tell they poured their heart into this project.When the film opens up it cuts between Speeds background and an exciting race. This is great because it shows the great background of the characters gradually and letting some action in as well.Some great cinematography using some great green screen which adds to the anime style letting it stay true to the TV show. But at times i did find myself gawping at the screen like an idiot going ""oooooh pretty colours!"" but there are some great comedic moments.the action sequences are intense and well done.there are LOTS of strobe lights so be aware.so all in all a good popcorn flick and definitely worth seeing.",Speed Racer
126,Red_Flag,It's the cinematic equivalence of candy floss. Often too sweet.,4,25 May 2008,"If there were ever a film sweet enough to rot your teeth Speed Racer is it. The overly camp, child friendly take on the animation. Overshadowing greats such as Return of the King and King Kong when it comes to shiny visuals and its definitely more colourful than both of them. Or any other film for that matter. Red, blue, pink, purple, green, orange, yep speed racers got them all and is never short on entertainment. And while it succeeds in creating a visual treat for the eyes it fails in providing an emotional tug on the heart.But when aimed at an audience who primary ideas of a good film involves such eye shattering visuals who really cares about all that? The parents of such obnoxious children maybe. The acting skills are top notch revving lead Emile Hirsch credibility up a hell of a lot considering her virtually unknown past. Christina Ricci always on top form provides much love and half of the eye candy with her petite top boyish love interest.The Matrix masterminds Andy and Larry Wachowski usher anime icon Tatsuo Yoshida's classic 1960s-era hit into the new millennium with this family-friendly story of a young race car driver who takes on the mysterious Racer X in a custom-made, gadget-loaded speed machine named the Mach 5.Speed Racer (Emile Hirsch) is the kind of driver that every wheel man wishes he could be: a born winner whose unbeatable combination of aggression, whose unbeatable combination of aggression, instinct, and fearlessness always finds him crossing the checkered flag with a comfortable lead. In Speed Racer's mind, the only driver who could present him with any real challenge is his late brother -- the legendary Rex Racer.Rex died in a heated cross-country rally known as The Crucible many years ago, and now his younger sibling is driven to fore fill the legacy that Rex left behind. To this day, Speed Racer is fiercely loyal to family. It was Speed Racer's father, Pops Racer (John Goodman), who designed the unbeatable Mach 5, and even a lucrative offer from racing giants Royalton Industries isn't enough to get the young ace to break his family ties.Right from the word Go, Speed Racer is hugely dependent on its visual effects and sound, which are both considerably good. Background music is like the cartoon itself. The title track is kept on hold till the closing credits. The whole movie is shot in front of a blue-screen it seems. Except for scenes inside a house, or in a garage, everything is CGI. The races are what attracts one most to the movie. They get your adrenaline pumping. It's like Fast and the Furious, animated. And that itself is the biggest let down. It's too much eye-candy, and less movie.My final verdict? It's a hard film to judge. On one hand it delivers exactly what you'd expect. Eye popping visuals and little to no emotion It's the cinematic equivalence of candy floss. Often too sweet.",Speed Racer
127,pmdawn,Modern Psychedelia,8,30 July 2008,"I'm not a Speed Racer fan. But I was delighted with this film.It's very easy to see why this movie was a flop, and why it will be a cult favorite a few years from now. This is the kind of movie that invests too much, in too many genres, and that was its ultimate mistake.The character interaction is goofy and family-oriented, exactly like the cartoons. The plot is merely a gizmo to introduce Speed Racer's story and get on with the action. In this aspect it seems like this movie is essentially for kids. I confess that sometimes I thought I was watching The Flintstones, The Jetsons and Ricky Bobby - all at the same time! One of my qualms with the movie was the delivery and the dialogue, which are so clichéd that they admittedly take a bit to get used to. But forget all that. At its core, this movie is an excuse for a psychedelic trip. If Sin City was a bad trip, this is a bedroom psychonaut's dream.This movie employs techniques unseen in American movies. In this sense, the film makers greatly respected and even enhanced the Japanese aura over Speed Racer. This is like those crazy Japanese movies that come out once in a while, but here in a dumbed-down form for Westerners.This movie is an easy contender for many awards in technical achievements. The visuals are fantastic. The whole movie is in bright, primary, glittery colors. Notice that purple coat? It's because it's an ""evil"" color in this movie. I hadn't even noticed until I saw in the trivia that ""Mom"" was the ONLY character to wear green in the whole movie. So there's some extra fun for trippers, synesthesia and color psychology.The pace is great, with the exception of some sappy family drama intertwined that really brings down this movie a notch. I wish they had cut more of the plot and left us with more eyecandy. But then they wouldn't have been so faithful to the original cartoon. Nevertheless, I believe this film would be so much better if it was shorter - skip the family scenes, skip the fake news announcers, and show us some crazy editing, that monkey driving, and Speed kicking ass on the lanes. Even Jack from Lost was well cast here - he looks exactly like his animated counterpart.Anyway, this is perfect if you just want a movie that makes you feel like you're tripping on psychedelics. I particularly am a sucker for those, for example Waking Life, Mind Candy and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.Speed Racer is not as complete or as mature a movie as those mentioned above, but it beats them all in terms of visual effects and pure cinematic delight. If you're into psychedelia, this movie was made for you.",Speed Racer

The computer animation fits right in with the style and most of the acting goes with the cartoon except for one or two small scenes. The script was great and I didn't get too lost in the script yet it was complex enough yet to still keep me intrigued for next time.One might think that the film would put overacting in on purpose (much like some indie horror films do) to pull off a cartoon like feel but for most of the movie the acting was not too much, again, except for maybe two scenes (one while speed is small, and maybe one of Ricchi's scenes).",Speed Racer

I was very surprised by how the Wachowski's had fleshed out what is really just a one-dimensional Japanese early anime cartoon. The CGI is over-the-top but has more color than an artists' palette. There is a lot of action and good comic relief in the form of Spritle - Speed Racer's little brother (with monkey companion). My only real criticism is there is a surfeit of dialog which I think put everyone in the theater to sleep (inlcuding me and my wife). I think the 2 and 1/2 hour run time could have been whittled to 2 hours by eliminating much of this talking, most of which is just spoon fed morality and object lessons. There is more than car racing here - it seems that everyone has some special Kung-Fu or wrestling ability and have to use them against Ninja!! By the end of the movie I think we all had a good time and were entertained (and well rested). If not for the excessive dialog I would have given it a 7. I think it is worth seeing, especially if you are a budding designer. Enjoy",Speed Racer
130,theycallmemrglass,Crazy fun but most surprisingly you care for the characters,9,17 September 2008,"I am not sure if this movie is ground breaking in its visuals. Sure, this is a super colourful, visceral, high adrenaline cgi cartoon with human interaction. You can do anything with cgi but the key is to entertain and in my book the Warchowski brothers deliver superbly. The visual is sumptuous once you accept the canvas this movie is painted on. The pacing is frenetic with plenty of humour, ultra cool moments, and riveting races. But most surprisingly, you find yourself caring and rooting for the characters and booing the bad guys! Whether you are a boy, girl, man, woman there is a lot to enjoy in this movie for everyone. Oh and Matthew Fox who I find quite boring in Lost, was pretty damn cool in this movie.",Speed Racer
131,Quentintarantado,Pretty good,7,12 May 2008,"To be fair I was quite tired when I saw this, so around the middle part I was dropping off a little. For a kid's flick it sure has a complicated plot (but maybe I can attribute that to my exhaustion). I didn't get a lot of things, like why Speed joined forces with Taejo & Racer X and the government guy. However, the pluses are it sure is a fantastic-looking film, all the races were exciting and the ending was especially gripping. I like the recurring theme about family and being true to your roots. Why did it fail? I can fault myself for watching when tired, but I think the movie might be too long (you equate length with weighty epics). Precisely why should it be two hours plus? Nevertheless, I do hope that history would validate the Wachowski's big-risk gamble a few years from now. One day, who knows? It didn't succeed now, but I see quite a lot of love letters among the user comments. Add my review to those, it's just that it isn't an unqualified rave.",Speed Racer
132,machngunjoe,"People are torn with this, so, for what its worth .....",7,30 October 2008,"I understand why people are torn with this movie. Because its the best movie ever in some areas and not so good at all, even painful in others.So heres the good:Graphics: The directors managed to set the par again for movies, the FX were something I have never seen before. If I could've only watched this in an IMAX theater oh GOD! To watch this move you must have a big HDTV Blu-Ray, otherwise you're missing out. The action was fantastic and the Directors managed to film it paying tribute to decades of Anime style directing. Also the Movie was very funny, the comic relief characters were very amusing especially the little fat boy.The Bad: Well honestly the Directing and choice of cast.SPOILER (I THINK): The movie was filled (and I mean FILLED) with flashbacks, and flashbacks during very Climatic scenes, which in turn made it anti-climatic and if your not used to complicated flashbacks, a little confusing on whats a flashback and what is happening presently. Imagine the long POD race scence in Star Wars Episode I filled to the rim with flashbacks. It dosen't work!Also as mush as I love these actors, Susan Surandon and John Goodman played the parts of Susan Surandon and John Goodman. Different choices in actors, better coaching, or better writing (take your pick) should've won over here.But overall this movie is eye candy, PG appropriate and has good themes about greedy and the importance of family. A must see but should've been better",Speed Racer
133,EyeDunno,Campy Mach 5 Fun! (Lame spoilers),7,14 September 2008,"First, the ""spoilers,"" are announced for those who don't know about the Speed Racer story. I don't think I'm giving too much away. I'd think I'd be cheating the film a little with an 8 rating... I didn't expect that I'd actually enjoy it! But Don't get me wrong, I actually argued over the seven or 8 stars. I had hoped that we could have seen more about that Mammoth car, and seen more of the tricks performed by the Mach 5, like in the anime. I gotta also pan the young Speed Racer... his enthusiasm seemed really really lame. If I had the opportunity to drive with a big brother I idolized, I would act more blitzed than my first roller coaster ride! And, I also thought the thugs behind the wheel needed their characters fleshed out more. I've watched it about a half dozen times since getting the film. My favorite characters are Chim Chim *with* Spritle, and the young Trixie. She seemed really enamored with young Speed while Chim Chim's scene with Spritle while watching TV took me over the top with my interest in the film. Gotta love those pajamas! Some have really slammed the film. I tend *not* to agree with them. I see how the Wachowski bro's tried to remain faithful with the original series. Adding the creator (and voice) of the original Speed suggests that maybe they got his blessings. I had purchased the original 1960's cartoon complete set, watching it before the film. It had intense colors, and I see now why the direction went to a truly saturated experience. I laughed out loud several times while smiling through much of the rest. And the end shot of Speed threw my mind back to the cartoon. I do wonder if the Wachowskis planned for a sequel. If they did, and they worked on some of those picky things, maybe they'll lay out better production. But I don't think that studios would be eager for a sequel now. But for what I'm picking about, those things didn't keep me from tossing em aside just to enjoy it for what it is: a simple flick based on a short-running animated series. Period. Take it too seriously and you're just hating too much. Breaking down some of the main characters:Speed Racer (Emile Hirsch): Seemed somewhat passive during some scenes, but okay. Rex Racer (Scott Porter): Character might have been a little more hip, but he's okay too. Young Trixie (Ariel Winter): Great expressions and emotional recall (esp her anger scene) Spritle (Paulie Litt): I almost hated Spritle (wise guy kid types) from the still pics. His first speaking parts I wasn't convinced. But the chimp saves the day, and they worked well together. Mom Racer (Susan Sarandon): I thoroughly enjoyed her motherly role Pops Racer (John Goodman) Pops maybe cudda threw his voice around some more. Older Trixie (Christina Ricci): Her role should have been bigger - could have been fleshed out more as well.",Speed Racer

135,gdeangel,"Definitely worth seeing / not a ""weak franchise tie-in""",8,22 March 2009,"I caught this on video last night... most certainly it was NOT the weak franchise tie-in/prequel/etc. as suggested by the razzie nomination.Poor tie-in's vs. well done tie-in: look at the two ""Hulk"" movies... the one from 2008 has the whole back story in the opening credits, then moves on to telling a story that is interesting and entertaining. The Ang Lee one trips all over itself sorting through the rich and often inconsistent source universe trying to piece together a coherent backstory and conflict, accomplishing not much other than telling the audience things that are not important or that it already knows, and you end up with a boring disappointment of a film that basically lives or dies on its CGI ""wow"" factor. (Cf. The Punisher vs Iron Man).Speed Racer covered its whole back story in the first race sequence. The sequence shifts during that race were genius. The connection to the source material was accomplished not by nit picking through content of the source, but by duplicating motifs and tone (costuming, color, character behavior, etc. etc. true to the original stuff). This movie belongs up there with Sin City in that regard.Unfortunately, the visual effects sequences also went as over the top in the ""seizure inducing flashing lights"" department as you would expect from a one legged film that can only stand on its CGI. I honestly had to ask if some of the track racing scenes were lifted out of a direct to DVD (or more often ""made for cable"") Hot Wheels Racer cartoon which end up being the bonus prize when you mail in the proofs of purchase from five boxes of co-co puffs. Maybe that was intentional, a backhanded salute to the social status of the source material. But my criticism here was only present in the track race action sequences, and the film made up for it by its fresh use of other forms of visual storytelling. (One of my favorites is the exaggerated sequence where Pops does some butt-kicking).Parents be warned: due to the spasmatic virtual camera work during the race action, I would expect a child who has not been weened on PS3 and X-Box to watch this movie and have complete visual process overload, resulting in them climbing the walls and destroying much furniture (ironically, there is an actual scene in the film where the mother asks the kid watching TV: is that the same nothing you are doing that broke my last couch?)

I went to see Speed Racer because it had a fantastic trailer and that is enough to convince me to see a movie.The actual look of the movie was incredible - all the bright vibrant colours looked so well on the big screen. The movie was colourful, camp and fun which is exactly what it set out to be! The racing was great to watch and this is were the movie shone - the races were fun, colourful and exciting.I would have really enjoyed the movie if it wasn't for Chim-Chim and Spritle - they got far to much screen time and a lot of their humorous scenes were just embarrassing to watch although children will love them! I understand that they were a part of the original cartoon but on the big screen they just did not work for me - comedy monkeys are long past being entertaining. As someone new to the Speed Racer series I just didn't appreciate them - although fans will probably love seeing their antics! I would give the movie 6/10.

139,garrettderose,I don't understand why this movie got bad ratings,8,14 September 2009,"The Matrix, V for Vendetta... Speed Racer.All of them are in the same league to me.Speed Racer is excels in being different. The movie doesn't present itself in a very scene-to-scene typical way. Most of the notable scenes of the movie are edited inside-out of one another, much like a music video. It's a marvel that The Watchowski crew even had the guts to put something this artistic and advanced out there. With every big movie they put out, they slowly become more and more a favorite.Speed Racer is rated PG. It's a HARD PG. There's a couple ""S"" bombs and some really graphic/violent scenes. I thought it would've been better off if they refrained from any blood whatsoever. This is a VERY minor complaint though, as it's one of the only visible flaws in this great piece of film.Christina Ricci is so-so as Trixie. It doesn't seem very natural, but with all of the flashing lights and whirly-effects, it's very easy to overlook. This movie is an adaptation of a show that was very archaic and inanimate (technically speaking), so I'm guessing there wasn't much for them to work with. I'm glad the W brothers got to leave their artistic mark in this film, fill in the gaps the show left. I don't think it could've been done so tastefully in any other way.Great story, intense racing sequences, the look is amazing and unique in it's own, and John Goodman is an on-screen champion - as always.Moving introduction that gets you hooked from the get-go.Special effects are great.What else could you want in a movie?

Speed Racer is such a film. Nonetheless I gave the film a chance on being just what it promised, a good family film that everyone could enjoy, a family film by the Wachowski Brothers, makers of The Matrix Trilogy Speed Racer is as flashy, accessorized and auto-erotic as can be. And no surprise there since the Wachowski brothers (The Matrix, V For Vendetta) are at the controls, refashioning the screen to function more like a portal into a video game in progress. And with the cars decked out in high style as if part of a costume ball down a runway rather than a raceway.In contrast to its conventional family story, Speed Racer seems to exist in an alternate universe of total fantasy car worship, with paint jobs ranging from ruby red to shocking pink and everything in between. Which creates a strange overall sensation indeed, The DVD extras include the ""Speed Racer Crucible Challenge"" which is definitely addictive.

This film is a tough one because I can't figure out it's target audience, it's way too long for children and way too childish for adults.

143,brodie_kashmir,Speed Racer gets by on entertainment alone- barely.,8,14 May 2008,"Speed RacerI've often pondered if a movie can scrape by on sheer entertainment factor alone. Speed Racer answers yes, but barely.Based on the 60's anime series (check out the first season on Hulu), Speed Racer (Emile Hirsch) is the kid brother of racing legend Rex Racer, who walked out on the family business and met an untimely death in a cross country rally race. Ten years later, Speed is the next big thing in racing, and he must now compete to save his family's independent auto company, and to bring honour back to the sport of racing. In order to do so he must compete in the same race that killed his brother, there-by qualifying for the Grand-Prix. He's able to do so with the help of his father Pops (John Goodman), girlfriend Trixie (Christina Ricci), mechanics Sparky and Spritle (Kick Gurry and Paulie Litt) and the mysterious Racer X (Matthew Fox).I defended this flick for a long time because I figured it would come up against the same kind of nay-sayers that 300 hit last year. They just wouldn't understand the filmmaker's vision and direction. What Andy and Larry Wachowski were going for is a bizarre amalgamation of live action and anime. And fortunately for the film, they accomplish it. It's a high energy, very kinetic, very fantastical film. I was dazzled by the sheer ballsiness of it. And it did entertain me for the entirely too long 135 minute run time.But it came apart in the writing. That's where it got it's length. Too often the story plodded along toward the action. That could be the problem with translating anime to a feature film. Anime is known for taking forever to go somewhere (and why it got so popular with the ADD afflicted youth of America, I'll never understand). And it's sort of an irony of hypocrisies that the film called Speed Racer moves at a snails pace. But the Wachowski's never seemed to figure out that this wasn't a high concept action flick like The Matrix. It was a film based on an anime about a guy who races a really cool car to fight corporate corruption and avenge his brother's death. Stick to the racing guys.But the remarkably talented cast did their damnedest to work with the little they were given. Hirsch (Alpha Dog, Into the Wild) has set himself up as one of the most promising young actors in the game, and even with the kitchy dialog and drawn out non-racing scenes, you get this sense that he really is trying to do both his talent and the material justice. If only the Wachowski's had done the same.Ricci (Black Snake Moan) is pitch perfect as Trixie. As is Goodman (The Big Lebowski) as Pops. The two seemed to have a deeper understanding of the characters, that went beyond what was handed to them at rehearsals. Granted, Pops and Trixie aren't the most complex characters in the world, but they certainly are fun, and iconic in their own way. They knew it was important to get the characters right, and they did. Kudos to them.I would have to say that kids and those with only a passing interest in the original Speed Racer would enjoy this (especially kids), as the more hard core fans will only leave the theatre disappointed and feeling nothing but resentment and disdain for the brothers Wachowski.Brodie Mann",Speed Racer
144,piksplanet,Could have been better..,6,9 May 2008,"It was a huge surprise when the Wachowski Brothers, after making two cult favorites - The Matrix and V for Vendetta, announced that they were going to make a live-action movie based on the widely popular cartoon series Speed Racer. Somehow no one expected them to shift gear from making such mature art-films to a cartoon adaptation. After running after people like Shia Labeouf, Elisha Cuthbert, and Keanu Reeves, they ended up with Emile Hirsch, Christina Ricci, and Matthew Fox. Replacements who are given a huge responsibility to bring the cartoon to life.Before walking into the theater one must bear in mind that it is a cartoon adaptation. No one expects this to be groundbreaking cinema by any means. It is not an attempt at making a cult classic. To start off with, after watching it one will realize that the movie is aimed at audiences aged between 5 and 10. No one would ever expect the Wachowski's to come up with a film aimed at children. But, they have. It doesn't fail. But it doesn't succeed either.Right from the word Go, Speed Racer is hugely dependent on its visual effects and sound, which are both considerably good. Background music is like the cartoon itself. The title track is kept on hold till the closing credits. The whole movie is shot in front of a blue-screen it seems. Except for scenes inside a house, or in a garage, everything is CGI. The races are what attracts one most to the movie. They get your adrenaline pumping. Its like Fast and the Furious, animated. And that itself is the biggest let down. Its too much eye-candy, and less movie.The film itself is too long to be a children's movie, stretching to over two hours. The first hour and a half is quite boring. Too much politics and stock market. The stylization, like the cartoon itself, is very good. It is what keeps one interested for the whole length of the movie. There is too much detail when it comes to the plot, too less character development. Only Speed seems to be important. One forgets that there are others in the movie as well. There are really too many sequences which try to be funny, with Speed's little brother Spritle and his chimpanzee Chim-chim. Only one, right at the end, succeeds.Matthew Fox is the one who stands out in this wannabe artsy adaptation. He has great screen presence. He's lost a lot of weight it seems, and he has never looked better. John Goodman, Susan Sarandon play the parents well. Christina Ricci is a treat to the eyes. She looks years younger than she really is. Roger Allum plays the villain, Royalton. He's vicious with his duologue's, the cartoon element adds to the viciousness. I don't know why they'd want Shia Labeouf to play Speed Racer because he is too tall. There is no doubt about his talent though. Emile Hirsch, however, fits the bill perfectly. Although he still is growing as an actor, his casting as Speed Racer is perfect.Speed Racer is a film with a million and one flaws from the starting itself, where instead of concentrating on the race, there is more attention paid to showing the history of the characters. An efficient technique, if only they did it well. Someone will have to explain to me how Spritle and his little chimpanzee survived in the dickey of the Mach 5 when the car was traveling at over 300miles per hour. Racer X seems to be the only character who doesn't do anything cartoonish, which is a good thing. He's cool.The last quarter of an hour is what saves the film. The Grand Prix race is breathtaking. An old fashioned Colosseum-style stadium, the track and the race itself, with the efficient use of flashbacks, is a treat to watch. The last fifteen minutes is when the Wachowski Brothers got down to being themselves when making a movie. It is perfectly made. From the roar of the crowd, much like what we saw in the Quidditch World Cup Final in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, to the flash of the cameras, it just clicks.Speed Racer, minus all the adults talking about the stock market, minus Spritle and his annoying chimpanzee hogging the screen time, minus 20 minutes, probably would have been something better. If they ever make a sequel o this, they'll have to put a lot of work into it. If you watch this, remember that it is based on a cartoon and that is exactly how it is made. Like a cartoon. That done, you might just like it by the time it ends.Good visual effects, good music. Otherwise just a 5.5/10 in my book. Expected better. Then again, it is based on a cartoon.",Speed Racer

Had 'An Inconvenient Truth' been showing there would have been riots. There was just one other soul in the theater which is a real shame. 'Speed Racer' is a terrific movie, and a movie that has to be seen in a theater. It uses the screen in new ways, has incredible art direction, a psychedelic palette of primary colors and a primary color screenplay: Good guys and bad guys, a lot of humor, family, young lovers, kung-fu fighting, all at hyper speed, all fun, don't wait for the DVD...it will all be lost on the small screen. I don't know why word of mouth hasn't powered this movie. I asked the girl who was the only other attendee if she liked the movie: 'it's the third time I have seen it,' she said, 'I can't get anyone to come see it with me.' Bad marketing? Probably.

147,youngman44,Surprisingly Entertaining,9,12 May 2008,"Critics be damned, this was an excellent film. It is amazing that the critics, in general, raved over Iron Man and criticized Speed Racer. Just goes to show that the viewing public should not read critics before seeing a film as they create expectations that skew the viewer's perspective. I'll get to SR in a moment but one final point on Iron Man (since these were the two big films on back-to-back weekends) - It was a very good film, entertaining, cool, etc. but disappointing. Speed Racer was not nearly as disappointing. Speed Racer had some cheesiness to it, but then so do most action flicks, including IM. I was not expecting SR to be great but it turned out to be a phenomenally entertaining movie. What was interesting was to see the reactions of my late-teens kids (boy & girl) as they had not seen the original cartoon. Yet, they loved the movie as well! There were several subtle but very well-done allusions to the cartoon including an occasion when Speed is knocked off the road on a cliff and the classic Speed Racer gasp is heard - ""aahhh!"" There was also, after one race victory, the classic jump-out-of-car cross the arm pose from Speed. It was great stuff! Paul Trix classically portrayed Spritle. The point of going to movies is not to nitpick or ridicule - the point of going to a movie is to be entertained. If someone is a chick-flick fanatic, they won't want to go to this movie. If they are only a 'tough-guy' action flick fan, they won't want to go to this movie. If, however, you either enjoyed the original Speed Racer or you enjoy a variety of movie genre's - then by all means go to this movie, overlook the few cheesy bits, and enjoy!",Speed Racer
148,bloodymonday,Review: Speed Racer,6,21 May 2008,"At maximum velocity, ""Speed Racer"" is one hell of a ride. But the problem is the movie starts there (and never.....ever back down).Based on famous (I presume?) cartoon in 60's, ""Speed Racer"" is about a boy name Speed (Emile Hirsch) who lost his brother Rex (Scott Porter) in corrupted world of racing industry. Now he is a racer himself and finally showing enough of his natural talent to draw a big lucrative offer from big team like Royalton Motors. After consult with his family member (played by John Goodman, Susan Sarandon and annoying boy + very unfunny monkey), he rejects the offer. With the offer to Speed denied, Royalton wants to ensure that Speed will not win races. Speed finds support from his parents and his girlfriend Trixie (Christina Ricci) and enters The Crucible in a partnership with his one-time rival, Racer X (Matthew Fox), seeking to rescue his family's business and the racing sport itself.It seemed Wachowski brothers (hmm...I think they'll go with brother & sister now) intention is to make us get OD'ed on those snacks and candy bars. Well, the better explanation is that there's great amount of mind-numbing, psychedelic-like bright color that keeps on coming and coming and so on, whether we ready to take it or not. By that, I think the rightfully way to experience ""Speed Racer"" is to see it on IMAX, since all those chaotic moments are best pay-off once people see it on a very big screen.With all glitter and sparkle, ""Speed Racer"" can only be a half-decent movie, since there isn't a single one ounce of human's characterization in this film. Someone might argue that it's unnecessary in this kind of project. But actually, it is very important ingredients that will make audience really root for our protagonist and his members (previous week ""Iron Man"" prove to be a really good example on keeping balance between those two). The result of absence in this category surely causes a major setback to the visual department. Since all we have left is only 120+ minutes of uber-hyperactive, adrenaline pumping racing scene that soon begin to get tiresome and might wear some people off before the finish line.As you're already known, ""Speed Racer"" is the movie that you can't possibly take it serious (You get what you pay for when one of the Racer's family members is a monkey). The Wachowskis, in my book, is still the most important and idiosyncratic filmmaker living today. And what makes them ideal is how masterfully they put innovative visual style into their pop art culture films. ""The Matrix"" isn't just a famous dodging bullet scene, but also the director's own interpretation of Neo-Marxism theory. ""V for Vendetta"" may not directed by them, but their watermark are all over it. Since then, we simply can't wait for their next project. But once we saw this film, we all might have one important question for The Wachowskis. Why ""Speed Racer""? BloodyMonday Rating: 2.5/4",Speed Racer
149,gevalero,Unique to say the least.,8,10 May 2008,"I can understand why some people might detest this movie (just see what most critics said) but the one undeniable fact is that it perfectly captures the spirit of the TV show which was never really associated with profound human feelings. It's amazing how everyone involved in it simply decided to go all the way: just look at the conviction with which Susan Sarandon and John Goodman recited lines that clearly feel out of a cartoon. Normally I hate movies with quick cuts and gratuitous CG effects and while SPEED RACER is 135 minutes of quick cuts and CG. I guess nostalgia goes a long way. I was so glad they included the sound effect of the Mach 5 jumping over and over again. I can't blame anyone for complaining on leaving the theater with a headache. The world outside the theater I saw SPEED RACER in looked so slow once the movie ended, this is one exhausting film.

Several years later I heard that the creators of the more or less Matrix trilogy will adapted this peculiar character and his fellas, then I said ""good FX + an interesting cartoon + lot of action = a superb summer movie"" but no, it didn't happen .In fact Speed Racer loses absolutely the size, grace, intrigue, so any quality of the series is lost in this adaptation that shows many special effects (mostly pathetic) and little substantive action. One hour, more or less, was what I had to watch a series of lines poorly planned, pathetic performances and above all a kind of transitions, used when the characters argue with each other, that were an insult to any sense of aesthetics. I said one hour because from there the film begins to show a little more resemblance to the original series with some action sequences well made and a successful use of effects, but still it falls short.It really is, so far, the worst movie of 2008 summer, this film is more closer to Matrix Revolutions than the first MAtrix, there is no doubt the Wachowski brothers should engage only in special effects. What they have done with Speed Racer?",Speed Racer
151,abrown975,THIS is a good family movie! Why can't we have more of this?!,7,22 July 2010,"This is a great example of a family movie. Here is my definition of a family movie: it's not always a 10/10 or maybe even a 9/10 (they rarely are), but they will always keep anyone captivated. If it keeps the kids, the teenagers, the parents, and maybe even the grand-parents captivated while still being child friendly (or at least mostly), then it's a great family movie. Speed Racer is just great. It has an all-star cast, in which every cast member fits their role perfectly. The acting is terrific. It's not boring or over-exaggerated. But the best thing about this film, which I'm sure everyone knows, is the special effects. Visual effects, sound effects, you name it. The visuals are just phenomenal. It's astounding this wasn't at least nominated for an Oscar. The same with sound. And how can I leave out one of the catchiest character theme songs of all time? Just hearing ""Ge Speed Racer, GO!"" gets me ready to go on an action-packed race car ride! However, the only problem I have with the movie is the Spritle character. I know, he's supposed to be the annoying little brother with the pet monkey, but he just sort of, well, annoys me. I feel like he got a lot of camera time that should have been reserved for Speed. Other than that, this is the perfect example of a family movie. Want a good movie for Sunday family movie night that you can enjoy while passing around a bowl of popcorn? Speed Racer is your movie.",Speed Racer
152,blindredemption,Strange,5,20 May 2008,"Strange is the first thing I've always thought about when I saw Speeder Racer stuff, it's such a neat and strange show. I thought it could have been a movie, but done in a proper way.I'm pretty sure they did here, almost perfectly. I mean it looks like a cartoon, take that how you will, but this is the way it's SUPPOSED to look like, Like a strange cartoon. The racing is a really new level in cinema, not groundbreaking like the Matrix's affect on action, but they've certainly stumbled onto a strange new way of making films. I liked it actually, the whole strange cartoon dialouge, look, and action. It was Fun, and i don't think it was to be taken in any other way.Good time if you're open to it, a laughable joke if you're not.7 out of 10",Speed Racer
153,wolverinesforever,"Fun movie, great visuals",7,10 May 2008,"Going into the 1:40 showing of this movie, I wasn't sure who to trust: the critics who were trashing this movie, or the IMDb users who had fun with it. Well, after watching, all I can say is ignore the critics with a capital ""I"". This is a film you will need to make up your own mind about; the visuals may polarize some, but if you get into the picture like I did, you'll be laughing! This is one funny, fun, campy ride, and it is perfectly self aware of it's own identity. The Wachowski brothers have created a visual spectacle that is truly dazzling (I don't use that word often) to watch and also simply wants to have a fun time with you. It succeeds on both counts.The plot is pretty simple; young Speed Racer (Emile Hirsch) has caught the eye of the business mogul Mr. Royalton (Roger Allam), who wishes to buy out Speed Racer and his family (John Goodman and Susan Sarandon as Mom and Pops Racer) and turn Speed into the real deal. Speed however, wishing to maintain his family's independent reign turns down the offer, only to find soon after that Mr. Royalton and various other business sharks are plotting against him for their own corporate interests. Speed then sets out to prove his worth on the race track, with help from his girlfriend Trixie (Christina Ricci), the mysterious Racer X (Matthew Fox), and unconditional support from his brother Spirtle (Paulie Litt).The visuals of this movie are fantastic. The movie is wonderfully colorful, and the races are that much more heightened by the movie's visual style. Frankly, I've never seen a more diverse palette. The FX are top notch. Credit to Owen Paterson and to the FX team.One complaint I did have about the movie were the races. The races are edited a little too quickly for their own good; sometimes the action on the track doesn't develop into the high octane rush that it should. It was also occasionally annoying when the film cut to commentators or to the audience. But I was able to set that aside and enjoy the show anyway. There's thrills to be found and plenty of entertainment to keep you satisfied.All of the actors do well with their roles. Emile Hirsch is very good as Speed, and Christina Ricci holds her own as Trixie. Roger Allam is deliciously campy as Mr. Royalton. Matthew Fox makes do with little characterization (understandable, of course) as Racer X. John Goodman and Susan Sarandon are very effective as Speed's parents and even Paulie Little was fun to watch as Spirtle (compliments also to the chimp).The Wachowski's clearly have fun with the material, and quite often they'll camp up the movie for some laughs. This works very well. You're having fun, they're having fun, everyone is having a good time. Highly recommended escapist entertainment for everyone to enjoy.",Speed Racer
154,scottwallvashon,The Death of a Dream,1,18 December 2008,"I was just the right age when the original Speed Racer came to America. The combination of technological marvels, high concept plots, and incredible scenarios appealed to my preteen mind. But I think the thing that really captured my imagination was the deep and often menacing situations that Speed found himself in. My strongest memory of the show is the scene where Speed, the Acrobat team, and a handful of other racers are looking across a dark canyon with walls collapsing in the pouring rain wondering who will have the courage and skill to get across it. While it was the marvels that drew me to the show, it was the complex emotions that pulled me in.I am a true Speed Racer fan. I have the Johnny Lightning versions of the best known cars. I have the complete series on DVD. I have often fantasized about having a functional full-sized facsimile of the Mach 5. Just the other day, while I was walking by a construction site, I noted how certain excavated areas reminded me of that dark and rainy canyon. I imagined how delighted I would have been as a child to have found that spot and to have had the Johnny Lightning version of the Mach 5 to play with there.When I heard that a movie version of Speed Racer was coming out, I was ecstatic. I waited impatiently for the first glimpse of the life-sized car. Then I started hearing interviews from the directors describing their creation. They said things like, ""Speed Racer was like one big LSD trip."" I thought to myself, That can't be right! I went back to my DVD's and watched them to see if I could tell what they were talking about. It just wasn't there. True, the original animation was paced and simplified in often humorous ways to appeal to younger minds, but there was no ""LSD trip"".When I saw the first trailers for the film, they seemed off to me. They were just too bizarre and erratic. I didn't go to see it when it arrived in the theaters. Finally, I rented it on Netflix.After five minutes, I couldn't even stand it. This was not merely a misinterpretation of Speed Racer. This was a conscious insult by someone who didn't like it and wanted to make something else. I fast forwarded to the end to see if there might be some scene that captured my original impression of the show. After that, I gave up.I hear a lot of people saying that the problem was in translating anime into real life. This is a vacuous argument. Just as you add depth and complexity to the images, you add depth and complexity to the characters. It is not unprecedented to tell a story at different levels of complexity. Look at all the different versions of the Bible or the history of the United States. Look at what was done with Superman, Batman, Spiderman, and The Incredible Hulk! If the writers were not up to the challenge, they should not have taken it on. I folded the DVD into its Netflix sleeve and set it on the counter in our hallway where we put outgoing mail. When it comes time to rate it, I will give it one star.",Speed Racer
155,lucasaq-1,Nothing to it but fun filled mindless adventure with a clear-cut value scale,7,9 May 2008,"All these colors, racing across the screen and pervading into my retinas, it is almost the equivalent of watching 2001: A Space Odyssey except without the classical music and the ambiguous plot. The Wachowski Brothers, creators of the visually stunning Matrix film and the equally as slick V for Vendetta action / terrorist fest give the audience a shower of colors in this adaptation of the famed cartoon. Everything is quite simple, that is never in question and anyone going in for a complex story is sorely mislead. This is a tongue and cheek homage of sorts to the corny animated cartoon series. Go in for an enjoyable ride of slick racing action and dazzling effects and very bright colors and you will not be very disappointed as the film delivers several excitement-filled races, which are never in question.That is the whole thing of going in watching this, go for the fun of it not some deep story with complex villains. It is clear-cut even from the design what is good, what is bad, and the musical cues are dead give a-ways. Emil Hirsch plays the one-minded hero of the film Speed Racer and does a nice straight arrow job of it in contrast to his great performance in Into the Wild where he plays a free spirit. Here he plays the loyal and justice driven son. On the other side of the spectrum is Roger Allam who plays nefarious Royalton who is the big company owner who would sell his soul to keep winning and fixing the big races of the film. These two especially Allam ham up their scenes along the corny dialog to display their divergent natures Allam as the definition of evil and Hirsch as the innocent and driven hero, but that is completely all right given the material. I did not go in expecting a serious film, but fun filled corny adventure.The films most attractive feature, of course, is the extremely saturated coloring, which gives a very surreal nature to the film and makes everything blur in a rainbow effect. This works especially well as reality and imagination are blended throughout the film. It makes the film feel corny and outrageous through and through which never leaves in doubt the tone meant for the film. So my advice for those who would go see this highly enjoyable flick is leave your analytical mind behind because there is not much to this tale. Nothing to it but fun filled mindless adventure with a clear-cut value scale.",Speed Racer
156,ven2s,Heart Warming...Go Speed Racer...Goooo!!!!!,8,9 May 2008,"I watched Speed Racer as a kid and loved it! Now as a series, Speed Racer was not, generally, any deeper than its 2 dimensional rendition in anime, but the mystery surrounding his brother brought a few tugs. Now if you expect the movie to be some more realistic, darker, Speed, stay home because you'll hate it! But if you want to see a true homage to the original, then you will be happy you went!! This movie is definitely a family movie with a mix of camp humor and bubble gum colors for the kids, or the kid in you, and some excellent action and drama for adults and the adult in kids! But for me the heart warming moments were what made the movie especially between Speed and Rex his brother. Speed as a child and his moments with ""Pops"" and ""Mom"" as a kid and as an adult, were really well acted by John Goodman and Susan Sarandon. Emile Hirsch is just building a great resume' as a versatile actor, if you haven't seen ""Into The Wild,"" I highly recommend you rent it; he does a great lead in that true but tragic story. As as Speed, Hirsch captures the fictitious character's determination and courage and amplifies on his inner turmoil and pain. Matthew Fox as Racer X was a great pick, and works well in the movie; nice to see his acting skills apart from his sojourn on ""LOST."" The music is excellent and although there are a few repetitive moments, some flat spots, and some over the top spots, I believe you will enjoy the ride; especially if you grew up watching the series!",Speed Racer
157,SebaZava,Only for certain audiences,8,20 September 2008,"I don't know why Speed Racer has been maligned by the majority of major critics. This is definitely the most fun I've had while watching a movie in years, and although it's not as good as last weekend's major release, Iron Man, it's definitely a darn good flick. You know what? Maybe it's got to do with the age of the viewer. Most of the critics are 30 year olds or 40 year olds, and since the film is so fast and wild and colourful and full of CGI, it's pretty much impossible for them to enjoy it. A more digital generation, a generation of people who have grown up with videogames and computers and Pixar movies will definitely have a lot of fun with Speed Racer. Yes, I'm talking about of people my age (17) and younger. Speed Racer is one crazy flick, a mix of digital effects and real-life actors that manages to tell a compelling story, while providing with impressive CGI work and solid performances.As everybody must know, Speed Racer is based on the Japanese cartoon of the 60s, but the great thing is that one doesn't have to be fan in order to enjoy the movie adaptation. The story is pretty straightforward and easy to follow, and characters, while not exactly developed - most of them are archetypes -, have their own backstories which make them more interesting and identifiable: heroes are heroes, and villains are evil and hateful - there's only one character who does seem to be on the gray area of characterization, but the film doesn't dwell on him too much.In order to create their movie, the Wachowskis didn't want to create a mere film adaptation. They wanted to create an experience, a flick that would resemble a cheesy cartoon come to life. The whole film was shot in front of blue screens and green screens, and the majority of the sets and backgrounds - if not all of them - were created inside a computer. All this means, of course, that the movie is visually impressive, awe-inspiring and exhausting. Cars fly around and flip and attack using hidden weapons and transitions are used by means of superimposing images and close-ups. Car races are, for the most part, completely computer-generated, and are so exaggerated that the viewer feels as if he/her were watching a realistic-looking cartoon. Speed Racer has a unique look and style, providing with a cinematic experience in a fashion that has never been seen before. It's all really cool.I guess that's why there are so many conservative viewers that haven't liked Speed Racer. The movie's fast and wild, and constructs its scenes and racing sequences in rather unorthodox manners. Some may consider that one has to be an ADD viewer in order to enjoy the movie, but I don't think that's true. I can enjoy Speed Racer as much as I enjoy The Maltese Falcon (I'm not comparing the two flicks, of course, but you get the idea), so yeah, I'm a pretty normal guy, and I had tons of fun with film. I didn't get dizzy or lost, and I was just marvelled by its (intentionally) cheesy CGI and impressive set pieces.But special effects aren't the only things that make a film worth-watching; there are things like performances, for example, that are important for a motion picture to work, and thankfully, Speed Racer has pretty good acting. (Had the performances or the storyline been crappy, the movie would've only served as a demonstration of what CGI can do.) Emile Hirsch (Girl Next Door, the impressive Into the Wild), while not particularly great, is not bad as Speed. He's the classic hero, the selfless and naïve boy who wants to fight the big corporations. Yes, he's a little boring (I guess the Wachowskis have a tradition of providing with somehow dull leads - just go and watch Keanu Reeves' performance in The Matrix and its sequels), but I found him likable enough. Christina Ricci is great as Trixie, and Matthew Fox is suitably mysterious and dark as Racer X. Susan Sarandon and John Goodman don't have much to do as Speed's parents, and Roger Allam goes amazingly over-the-top as Royalton - a memorably evil villain for a memorably cartoonish movie.But audiences watch films like Speed Racer in order to watch the races, and fortunately they won't be disappointed. Apart from being visually stunning, these sequences are also pretty tense and exciting too. There was more than one occasion in which I had goosebumps while watching one of these scenes, and since Speed as likable and worth-rooting-for, one can actually feel for him during his quest for glory and destroying Royalton's plans. Races are not hard to follow - at least not for me nor for my girlfriend - and apart from trying to now what's going to happen next, one awaits these races in order to discover what exaggerate and outrageous situations and tracks the Wachowskis can come up with. Physics and logic are not present in these set pieces - they're as exaggerated and outrageous as any race could be, and that's why they're so fun.Speed Racer has the right amount of action, races, impressive visual effects, cheesy characters and juvenile humour (courtesy of Spritle Racer and the monkey, who become involved in some amusingly cheesy situations), which makes it really fun. You may have noticed that I've used the words ""cartoonish"", ""cheesy"" and ""visual"" a lot in this review. Well, I guess those words pretty much sum up the whole film. If you go and watch it with an open mind and considering it's gonna be a really cartoonish and wild flick, you'll by no means be disappointed.",Speed Racer
158,stefanbe,Pure visually impressive entertainment all the way! Go Speed Racer Go.,8,29 July 2008,"The transition that an animated series takes from being a Saturday morning cartoon towards turning into a cinematic live-action feature is most always a rocky one. Horrible efforts like Mr. Magoo and The Flintstones in Viva Las Vegas have left fans of those beloved 1960's characters with anger, this reviewer included. With Speed Racer, Andy and Larry Wachowski have succeeded in creating a big-screen version of a cult cartoon series worthy of being called an adaptation. The clichéd plot of the film is saved by interesting and funny characters, fun-filled action sequences and some of the most kinetic and fascinating visual effects work put on film. The former directors of The Matrix, a film which I personally dread, understand that they are essentially making a big-budget cartoon with live actors and do not take themselves seriously. And therein lies the fun that Speed Racer holds.Speed Racer (Emile Hirsch) loves racing and throughout his whole live has wanted to be like his late brother, driving towards world records and the Grand Prix trophy. Even though the race tracks of his futuristic wonderland is filled with booby traps and other dangers, his family supports him. His father (John Goodman) is an independent race car maker, while his younger brother Spritle (Paulie Litt), mother appropriately named Mom (Susan Sarandon) and long-time girlfriend Trixie (Christina Ricci) cheer at the sidelines. He also has a pet monkey called Chim-Chim, who provided some of the film's funniest moments. After a very successful race, Speed is given the chance to join a much bigger company lead by the usual smug, stereotypical British villain (Roger Allam). However, after a shocking revelation that racing is fixed, Speed teams up with the mysterious Racer X (Matthew Fox) and the trouble-arousing Taejo (Rain) to save the sport he holds so dearly to his heart.The main focus of Speed Racer is entertainment and at that, it does a terrific job of pulling the audience in. The visual effects are incredibly well done and quite possibly some of the best ever brought to the film. The entire feature is one giant kaleidoscope of images springing towards the audience, almost giving it a 3-D feel. The Wachowski Brothers go for the opposite route of, say, Tim Burton and create a vibrant and colourful world that feels like diving inside a giant pool of Skittles. Many will accuse the filmmakers of trying to go for a video game approach for Speed Racer, but in the case of a film whose main theme is racing, it's appropriate. Not even the great minds at Pixar made a racing car film as exciting as this one and it will be especially hard to watch Formula 1 Racers driving around the curbs without thinking of the spectacular scenes that the Wachowskis have built. The Wachowskis have also in the process not only created something worthy of being called a Speed Racer adaptation, but a big-screen version of Super Mario Kart as well. The imaginations of those two are out of this world and they even trump the Nintendo people in race car weaponry.However, Speed Racer doesn't become a well done film on the excitement level alone. The Racer family never comes across as snotty and the audience generally cares for them, even annoying little Spritle. Emile Hirsch does fine work as Speed and while the character is still relatively cardboard, he gives a good enough performance that we still root for him. Christina Ricci is a long way from Wednesday Addams providing the most anime-like portrayal in the film as Trixie. John Goodman is especially fun in the role of Pops and Matthew Fox's appropriately flat work as Racer X adds to the character's mystery. The only poor performance in the film comes from Stephen Colbert's arch-rival and Korean pop sensation Rain as Taejo, who is lively as the furniture that appears in the scenes with him. The best performance from the film, however, does not even comes from a human being as chimpanzees Willy and Kenzie prove to be a very engaging bunch as the mischievous Chim-Chim.The other major positive of the film comes from Michael Giacchino's usual brilliant score. As proved by The Incredibles, he can write some really great action scores and Speed Racer is not exception. However, the main theme song from the television series will probably still in viewer's heads more and it is quite a lively tune indeed. Speed Racer is a film that should be best viewed in the cinema to get the true cinematic experience of it all, but on a good enough television set, it can hopefully provide a fun enough experience for the whole family. Despite its length of over two hours, the time flies by and the film proves to be incredibly engaging and it feels like the 1980's has nudged its way nicely to the 21st century.",Speed Racer
159,SmokeyTee,"Fun, well made family film but overcomplicated & 129 minutes!!!!",7,15 January 2009,"I remember speed racer although I don't think I ever watched an episode. It was kinda cool, kinda Japanesey. This films goes super Mario with over the top colours and video effects. Which actually works.My only 2 complaints apart from poor old John Goodman looking like the bug man in a human skin from MIB was that 129 minutes of *very* samey movie is just too damn much for most people and way too much for a kids film...Also the corporate intrigue might have been aimed at adding a level of depth to the movie but it just complicated it beyond what it needed and I suspect would have been, well, lame to younger viewers.A lot of people complained about the kid and monkey but I thought the kid was great. And chimps, well, whatever.I guess if it was 60 minutes it might have kept our interest. We just couldn't be bothered after 2 hours of racing and fastfowarded the big finale... The main character was yawn as well, one Chris O'donnell in the world is quite enough thank you Hollywood!~ See it in 2 screenings, maybe.",Speed Racer

Though as much as I don't like Emil, he did an okay job as Speed, he's just one of those actors that has a great casting agent that can sell him in anything, too bad he shouldn't 'be' in everything.

161,buiredintime,You Don't Need Sugar To Get A Rush Out Of Speed Racer,7,9 May 2008,"Okay where to begin this movie is one of a kind. A what I have now classified as a new genre that i'm calling the acid & coke with out the acid & coke movie. Speed Racer is the first to be inducted into this movie.It is downright pure adrenaline to the max, a movie that takes you on the drivers seat, and forces you to feel exhausted when your done. I'm not going to go into any story plot, because it's not why we go to movies like this. We go to see the action, and action for the most part is what we get. To the max is what I like to call. The racing in this movie is so unique it's original. It's never really been seen in the way it's displayed before.You almost feel like your watching the cartoon as live action. I give credit to ILM I thought what they did with Iron man was incredible how life like Iron Man was I thought it was a leaps and bounds movie. Boy was I wrong this movie is the leaps and bounds that proves how truly good ILM is, and why they win the Oscar every year, but this movie takes special effects to a whole other level, there's nothing out there that at least I can see that has this amount of insane cgi. It makes the beginning and end battles of Episode 2 and 3 look quite tame. Trust me it has to be seen to believe.On that note the movie does play very much like the cartoon with the wipe anime cuts, and the over excess use of vibrant colors. I'm actually reminded of the segment in the Twighlight Zone movie with the kid who creates a house, and a family with his imagination, and it's truly creepy. This is quite like that but on a acid trip gone to the max.The acting is what it is camped up and sweet, this is a feel good movie with in incredible sense of self worth. If it weren't for people like John Goodman, Susan Sarrandon, Emile Hirsch, Christina Ricci and even Matthew Fox (not playing Jack from lost this time) the movie wouldn't be believable in it's values. They Racer family is the perfect whole natural 50's television family, and they fill the parts real well.I can't say the same about the script, which The Wachowski's have never been known to be very strong in, but they do excel in the same field as the likes of Robert Zemickis and George Lucas they try to push the envelope and try experimenting on ways to make the best look better, and that's where The Wachowski's get there marks, and what makes them unique.Anyways that's enough of me.Peace",Speed Racer
162,SophomoreSlump,The Future is SPEED!,9,12 May 2008,"Last week, I went to see Iron Man. The movie was a bit clichéd but it blew me away. Iron Man and Speed Racer have much in common. For one thing, the main character's name is in the title. Both of them are heroes; Iron Man wants to defeat terrorists, Speed Racer wants to take down the racing moguls and corruptions. And both movies are very futuristic with lots of technology and upbeat soundtrack. Somehow, Speed Racer was much better than Iron Man for me. Well, for one thing, it's family-friendly because the story can give you a warm-hearted feeling, and for another, it is visually GROUND-BREAKING!The GOOD: For some, it may take a few moments to adjust to this ""world built for speed"", as mentioned in the trailer. After you got it, you're in for a ride! The visual is shiny, yet realistic. It seems that those cars and buildings are real. The best part is when Speed revives his new car, the Mach 6, by going straight into the 5th gear and burst and twists his way through the whole track at full roaring speed! The ""Car-Fu"" didn't seem silly at all. At first, I thought the Wachowskis ought to ease up on the car stunts. But they did it well enough for it to look realistic, fun, and serious. This is because Speed, Racer X and other drivers use it in the most stylish way to get out of tight spots. Not surprisingly, there are a few Bullet-Time camera techniques (the slow-mo camera orbit; one of the Wachowskis' trademark) used throughout the movie.Some might say the acting is corny, especially for those who saw the trailer and TV spots or previews, but really, it's not. The Wachowski Bros. were aiming for tackiness, but that's the only part of the movie they didn't do well in. The acting looks real and believable. Emile Hirsch (Speed Racer), Christina Ricci (Trixie) and Matthew Fox (Racer X) are perfect for the mains. Matt Fox seemed very intimidating are some points...and he can fight! And Rain, he wasn't too bad. Looks bad-ass, save for the fact that he got beaten up, poisoned and have a little screen time compare to Speed. The worst actor I could find (except for Sparky, but no one cares about him) is Nicholas Elia (Young Speed). At first, it seemed that he was just reading the scripts. But I guess things change after you had a ""big bro-little bro"" moment and it seemed that Rex's death touched everyone because he got better after that.The storyline and the emotion of the movie can give you misty-eyes. It's a perfect family movie. There was a sad moment when Speed was chasing Rex's ghost car but slowed down so that he won't takeover his brother's spot in the leader-board. The story is told at a very high-speed pace with a lot of flashbacks and (shockingly) flash-forwards (not surprising for those who watch LOST) at some point. While Royalton (Roger Allam) was intimidating Speed on how he won't finish the race, we see a vision of him crashing and the scene cuts to a disappointed Speed who didn't finished the race. The ending was predictable (the ""good triumph over evil"" ending) but the twist and turns along the way weren't. We found out that Racer X isn't really Rex, or is he? And is that Ricci racing the 2nd leg of the Crucible? And was the movie really over two hours? It felt shorter.The BAD: As much as I love the movie, I've to admit, it ate itself. You either love it or hate it, pal! The ground-breaking graphic could break someone's head. And the emotional storyline could be a bore to those who aren't fit for this kind of thing. The real problem for me was Spritle and Chim Chim's scenes. Yes, they could be funny. But they ruined the movie's mood. Like, when Royalton was intimidating Speed, the scene cuts to the ""monkeys"" having a wild ride around the Industries. And he disturbed Speed and Trixie's kisstwice! And they show the chimpanzee at the end credit. I'd much prefer them to show bloopers, character faces, the Mach's blueprint, etc. But no, they showed the chimpanzee instead.OVERALL: The movie was astounding and astonishing. The last race kind of made up for all its flaws. Although it is not the first movie to be shot fully in front of a green screen, but it was the first of its kind. The Wachowski Bros have built a whole new world since The Matrix. I won't be surprised if more movies are made this way in the future.Iron Man may have a higher rating, but Speed Racer has a more in-depth storyline. Iron Man may be the future of weaponry, but Speed Racer is the future of movies!",Speed Racer

But for those of us that aren't bothered by that this film is a real treat.I gave this a 10 for visuals and effects because it couldn't get much better for what they were trying to achieve. I gave it a 6 for story because it doesn't go beyond the call of duty.So I met in the middle and out pops an 8. Enjoy.",Speed Racer
165,ctg0724,Artistic Perfection,10,9 May 2008,"Everyone around me told me it was going to be terrible. Early reviews said that it was nothing special. With these planted doubts, I still went to see it in IMax. As of right now, it is the greatest experience I have ever had in a movie theater.This movie was pure fun. The Wachowskis truly know how to take risks. They just took their art and ran with it. All the actors were terrific. I especially gives props to the actor who played the youngest Racer brother. Honestly, I thought that boy would sink the film but after seeing it, Speed Racer would not have been half as fun without him and the monkey.This is most visually stunning film to date, with a climax that continues to climb and climb. I wanted to jump out of my chair and cheer for Speed at almost everything. Granted, the film was predictable, but I didn't care. I still held my breath at all the moments, asking myself if Speed would be able to pull it off. I've never smiled through a movie as much as I have with this one in a long time.Huge 10/10 for Speed Racer and a big thank you to everyone involved in making this masterpiece. My kids will be watching this film. If there is a Speed Racer 2, I am there.",Speed Racer
166,imdb-21622,Not for everyone,5,8 May 2010,"I like animation. I like racing. I can handle simplistic plots.I could not really enjoy the movie for a number of reasons. I fully understand not everyone would agree, and that's OK.* First and foremost, I was annoyed by the racing. I don't mind a bit of unrealistic racing. But time, and time and time again, cars would spin for no reason - apparently in this universe spinning 360 speeds you up. I just could not suspend my believe. I suggest anyone doing the movie in the future make the racing a little truer to reality. Just a little! * Graphics are too bright. Some will love this. I like bright video games. But this was too much at times * Graphics are too chaotic. Go look at the awesome animation in Kung Fu Panda. Beautiful. You have time to enjoy it. Even if the animation was cool in the movie from time to time it happened too fast. And why is everything so blurry looking.I think my problem is I love real racing too much. On real tracks, not on tracks made from a light bright set. I am 100% sure this movie was just not for me. If you love real racing, you may find yourself annoyed at times.",Speed Racer

168,gundognc,Crack Racer,10,10 November 2008,"Instructions for getting the most out of Speed Racer: Snort three grams of finest Bolivian marching powder, drink three large cups of extra-b*stard strength java and smoke a nice big bag of crack. Wait for the panic attack to set in, then enjoy film.There are films that make you a better person (or try), there are films that palpably make you stupider, but watching Speed Racer may well actually give you Attention Deficit Disorder.I'll never really forgive Messrs Wachoski for the gibbering half-dead abortions that were Matrix 2: The Dumbering and Matrix 3: The Dumberest, but in Speed Racer they have actually convinced me that there may be a place for them behind the camera.For those who aren't aware, the original Speed Racer (which some tiresome manga fan will no doubt insist should only be called ""Super Mega Wow! Go Go Racer Mishima Go!"" or some other nonsense) was a 1960's Japanese cartoon about the trials and tribulations of a young racing driver and his family. I happen to think that there is nothing more boring that motor racing  except possibly football (note: soccer not American football), as watching 22 of the world's stupidest millionaires kicking an inflated bladder around a field* is my personal definition of hell. Having said that however, and with no little surprise, I thought Speed Racer was brilliant and for my money probably the most enjoyable family film of the decade so far.In a break from the tradition of my reviews I am not actually going to offer a spoiler because: 1) spoiling Speed Racer would be a crime; and, 2) I wouldn't actually know how to.Speed Racer has it's own distinct visual style which can be best described as ""action so fast and colours so bright it'll make your eyes bleed"". In fact the film very sensibly doesn't try and disguise its CGI but instead flaunts it so obviously that you almost immediately accept it and stop noticing it. You'll accept that cars can corner at 800 kph and that a talented driver can out manoeuvre a falling, exploding car wreck on a near vertical road. People said that Sin City was the nearest thing to a comic book in film form but Speed Racer takes this one step further and actually looks more like a cartoon than quite a lot of cartoons.The film manages one of the really great tricks of family movie making which is to generate genuine suspense in scenarios where you are sure you can predict the outcomes. In particular the end sequence which, given the title of the film I don't think I am spoiling by revealing is a race will have all but the most cynical on the edge of their seat regardless of whether you think you know how it will end.I was lucky enough to see this film without having seen any of the hype and had no preconceptions whatsoever and went to see it because there was nothing else that I wanted to see rather than because I had come across any of the hype and I am glad of that. For the first half an hour I was thinking ""what the **** is this rubbish"" but I actually found myself sucked into the film completely and was gripped. An integral part of that is the fine (if slightly saccharine) acting from John Goodman and Susan Sarandon as Speed's parents and a joyously over the top turn from Roger Allam as mega-corp boss E.P. Arnold Royalton. Speed himself is well played and a special nod should go to Paulie Litt as Speed's younger brother who could rewrite the book on having an expressive face.In the end Speed Racer is a profoundly silly film and therein lies its charm. There is one particular scene that epitomises Speed Racer, one of the characters says, entirely straight-facedly ""It doesn't matter if racing never changes, it only matters that it never changes us"" and follows it up with the even more epic ""You don't get behind the wheel of a T180 because you're a driver, you do it because you're driven"". All it needs at that point is for The Sphinx to pop out and say ""When you can balance a tack-hammer on your head, you can head off your enemies with a balanced attack"". If you get that reference, congratulations, and do try and get a life.Go and see this film / buy it when it appears on DVD. If you can't enjoy this you've got no heart. Your brain may tell you that its rubbish but your inner 8 year old will be shouting with glee.*Note. I heard this line from someone or on something and I can't remember or find reference to it.",Speed Racer
169,codefool,"On Ode to the Cartoon - If you don't know it, you won't get it",8,12 May 2008,"I grew up with Speed Racer on an 11"" black-and-white television (the only set my family owned that had a VHF tuner.) When going to see Speed Racer the ""live action"" movie, it takes about 15 minutes to figure out that you're watching a ""live action"" cartoon, where cartoon physics apply or, rather, normal physics don't. The cars loop, flip, careen and crash together yet they keep going. Until you figure that out, it just doesn't look right. After you figure it out, you'll have a great time.I can see where this movie will be a tough sell - it will not have broad mass appeal to those who do not absolutely love the original cartoon. It will not create new Speed Racer fans. The audience for this will be those who will tap into the loving memories of watching the cartoon as a child. Otherwise, people will just not get it. We went on opening day, and there were a total of twelve people in the theater.The problems are few. We have a total of three races in the movie, but only one with the Mach 5. I was particularly perturbed at this - the Mach 5 is as much a character as Speed Racer is, and to substitute it for the Mach 6 in the finale I felt cheated. The second race is one of the grand multi-continent marathon feats similar to those in the series. Rather than just going around a track 200 times, the races in Speed Racer have to get Speed away from prying eyes so he can fight the bad guys, solve the case, then get back in to win the race. The final race is a blinding hot-wheels challenge track that gets so confusing to watch that by the end you really can't focus on what's happening. But the movie ends really, really, well.If you liked the series, go see this movie. It is a loving ode to its memory and the unabashed decency, courage, and family values it trumpeted to the young in the 60's (of which I'm.) I was grinning ear-to-ear just seeing my beloved Mach 5 in action again. And, after 40 years, I finally have a Mach 5 toy (they didn't do so much merchandising in those days.) Well done.",Speed Racer
170,Dark Raven,Ill conceived experiment,1,14 May 2008,"I love the Wachowskis, but this should have been Speed Racer: The Movie! Cartoons work because the people populating the world are cartoons just the same. Here you have real people against sub-playstation backgrounds. You could almost see the green screen. It's hard to engage with that, and to add insult to injury they kept the backgrounds in focus because, what, this is the way it was in the cartoon? The word 'adaptation' exists for a reason. This should have been ""a live action Speed Racer film"". You could still of had the production design as colorful psychedelic, the action as high speed, the narrative the same - but it wouldn't have had the disengaging feel of a cheap TV ad for a headache tablet At the screening I was at, which was mostly empty to begin with, the kids were bored silly. As I say I'm not a Wachowski basher (I personally love every movie they have made, sequels included, and consider them visionaries) but I was dismayed they had produced this cheap feeling turd. Critics can often be wrong, and in the past they have sometimes unjustly given the Wachowskis a rough time, but it seems that critics aside, the general public around the world has spoken on this one. I'm just thankful it means the Wachowskis can go back to making ""live action movies"" and not a sequel to this!",Speed Racer

173,gpaltrow2001,"Mostly for 'Speed Racer' fans-- hey, that's me!",7,23 May 2008,"I took my girlfriend and watched Speed Racer on Imax. Fortunately she also had watched the cartoons, so knew the characters. We definitely enjoyed it, and thought it better than what we were expecting. All movies should be seen on Imax, by the way-- yum. I loved the car, Emile Hirsch was excellent in that he had to play an iconic live-action cartoon hero, and the supporting cast was good (not great). The visuals are as stunning as you've heard. They are NOT as non-stop distracting as you may have read. Plenty of breaks in between the big races. It is obvious the Wachowski brothers love Speed, and truly did their best to put it all out there. Now, however, a note to Larry and Andy. Here is what you did wrong, and this is coming from a fan: You made the movie too long; 15 minutes shorter would have been better. This could have been accomplished in things like cutting the corporate menace down to the gist, since the convoluted version of it was a mess in the drama department. You also could have trimmed some sportscasters down, some of the races, and some of the personal scenes that came off as too corny. I didn't like the non-stop car spinning. I know the cartoon had spinning, but never as much. So much of computer car spinning had me realizing there was no sense of danger. Veering slightly out of control but moving straight ahead would have been better. You spent too much money on effects not necessary. The whole corporate monolith with its busy bees structure reminded me of the over-stuffed modern Star Wars Coruscant scenes. You didn't spend enough time working on the Speed and Trixie love story. You could have stayed PG with it and not been bloated, but we should care more about that relationship (a big reason folks love movies). Some parts of the races were filmed so hectic as to make them incomprehensible. Ugh. An example of an elegant race scene you did right was driving up the cliff with spiked tires. But even THAT was messed up when the annoying announcers said that Speed was driving up the cliff as we were watching it. The drama of the moment and a good soundtrack of the Speed theme would have sufficed. Okay, back to the good... I'm glad the movie was made, it was fun, brought back memories, and appreciate the care the Wachowskis took. Thank you!",Speed Racer
174,Ekul1021,Pretty good movie after all,8,31 December 2011,"When I first saw Speed Racer coming into the live action movie, I just though they're just screwing another anime cartoon. Not to mention it is directed by the Matrix brothers which I never liked the Matrix trilogy except I love Hugo Weaver who I thought was the best actor and reason why that movie had some redeeming quality. Anyways on to Speed Racer.I'm a fan of the anime series and remember having my first Mach 5 toys with the figures so, this movie wasn't that bad. It was actually pretty good, the storyline was another typical evil empire trying to get rid of The Racer family but the acting was pretty good.Roger Allam, whom we all know from V for Vendetta is in this movie as ultimate bad guy you just hate and he plays that part very excellent. Also for Matthew Fox as Racer X whom we all know is Speed Racer's brother who is always there for him and maintains that brother love as well. John Goodman, no doubt he loved that part.The color of the movie just gives it a fantasy you can't stop smile and marvel at it. Not to mention the movie was made not for just an action, but for fun. It was as if the movie was aim at the anime people who remember the first time they saw speed racer on TV. Music also contains the original theme song and plays wonderfully throughout the movie.Another thing that made Speed Racer stood out was the family watching over each other's back especially Racer X whom still loves his family and his brother who has now become a race car like him. Its this feature in the movie that really stands out and the theme is focus on family.Speed Racer is no doubt a fun and wonderful movie.

The plot is like any plot from a chapter in the series, the kind of plot we expected to see when we were kids and we meet speed racer for the first time; which I believe is better than reinventing a whole new character that is not related to the original and use a name for commercial reasons. After all, we went to see 'speed Racer'. The fact that the movie was finished in 2008 with the possibility of using fiberglass and high quality CG effects is also a way for some of us that many years ago day dreamed with a car like the M5, to see the (back then) car of our dreams come true, with all the gadgets in action.",Speed Racer

The CGI is terrible, very very obvious - so obvious that it was really off-putting. The acting is awful. The kid at the start (his name is Speed for gods sake!) is just so annoying and cheesy you want to throw something at the TV.I could go on and on but I wont. Its not bad in a funny way, its just plain bad. I couldn't even recommend this as a demo disc to show off your new plasma etc. Good job I rented it! Its difficult to understand exactly what the Wachowski brothers (who made the Matrix) were playing at here.Words fail. The worst film I've seen in a long time and like I said - I didn't manage 20 minutes before ejecting the disc - just as well as if I had to sit through the whole thing I wouldn't be responsible for my actions.Avoid.

178,alexis-21-81191,Great approach ... Significant Overlooks and Mistreatment plus weak Hero,6,14 September 2019,"The intro of this movie is what made me want to review this film and it was no surprise to see that the Wachowski brothers were behind it. It's constructed magnificently and takes full advantage of an aspect a lot of movies fail to. The start of any film is where you grasp the audience, using their open and rested minds to your advantage.But it's a double edged sword, and for some reason, the Wachowski's decided to do it again and again and again, basically overloading every turning point this film had, to such extend that the story was sacrificed in favor of directing art.The final race scene has been dressed in a way that's almost unwatchable, with rapid exchange of pov's designed to deliver the grand feeling, but we're not allowed to experience the heroes big moment so everything else is simply cancelled. They have treated several more turning points this way, but doing it to that final scene can only be described as a huge mistake.I felt almost every character except the hero but I'm not sure whether that is down to acting, or incomplete dialogue, especially during the opening sequences.Also the Sparky character is a mystery, as we're led to believe at the end that he's the fourth brother, but throughout the first half of the film, he feels like a guest or a living in employee. Having him on the podium at the end, left me thinking that this character was also mistreated.Color design was a little too much at times, but I didn't experience significant loss of concentration or displeasure because of it.If these mistakes, as I perceive them, were avoided, this would've been a very good film.The baby brother and the monkey brilliantly complement the design and fill the storyline with some very amusing moments. The big brother was also a nice twist but I'm not sure why he doesn't reveal himself at the end. Maybe their intention was a sequel, but without that, this too feels like a bit too much.",Speed Racer

Remember watching those little metal cars zip around on the track and trying to imagine what it would be like to be inside one? Speed Race gives you the opportunity.The Wachowski brothers follow up their massively successful Matrix Trilogy, with Speed Racer. This time the story is PG-rated and appeals to children ages 7-11, but do not let that scare you away! It is enormously entertaining and the most fun I have had at the movies in a long time.Speed Racer follows the story of a teenage boy Speed (Emile Hirsch), a born racer, who has just become extremely popular after winning a big race. His popularity has caught the eye of Royalton (Roger Allam), the owner and CEO of a gazillion dollar corporate conglomerate, who is bent on signing Speed onto his team of race car drivers. When Speed refuses to sign with him, Royalton goes about trying to destroy Speed's life as well as his parents (John Goodman, Susan Sarandon). Speed, feeling responsible decides to fight back; and to do this he mustyes you guessed itRACE! The plot has many more intricacies to it but I will leave that for you to discover when you see it.The casting was perfect, and everyone played their part flawlessly. John Goodman stood out the most as the passionate father, and relatively new Paulie Litt made quite an impression as Speed's younger brother.Yes, the script and delivery of some of the lines were rather sappy, and there were the moments of that warm fuzzy-wuzzy father-son-family time; all which could be annoying in other circumstances but here they actually almost suited it.Speed Racer does not disappoint and surprises you with how much you are drawn into it!

From the flickering images of the trailers I expected it to look much like a computer game, and for a lot of the film it does (right down to the ghost car Speed chases in the opening race sequence). Even the acting is largely reminiscent of computer game dialogue (especially the exchanges between Speed and Trixie).The use of colour is spectacular (some might say it makes it difficult to follow the action, and to an extent I might agree). The vision of the future is like a mixture of the 50s, 60s and 70s all at once, with a very quirky skyline. Beyond that there is a fair mix in of an 80s Manga kind of look (watch out for the TV clip and Spritle's fight with the chimp!) Goodman is solid and Sarandon is up to scratch as Speed's parents. Matthew Fox puts in something of a star turn as Racer X (his emotions are probably the most real thing about the whole film). Roger Allam is brilliantly slimy and repugnant (much as he was in V for Vendetta). Ultimately, though, given the style and presumed demographic, hats off to Paulie Litt as Speed's younger brother and the chimp! I think the Wachowski brothers have pulled off a winner here. There is so much about the film to condemn: it's cheesy, it's ridiculously unbelievable, the colours are bizarre and the acting is largely questionable, but as a combination, there is a nostalgic, boyish charisma that makes it magical.",Speed Racer

From the trailers, I though Speed Racer looked like another summer remake bore. All CGI and no heart, no story and no adherence to the old cartoon. Thankfully, my friend at work told that he and his son went to see and had a lot of fun watching it. I decided to check it out today and I have to say if you loved the old cartoon you should love this movie. Its Speed Racer, from the characters and their traits to the race across mountain cliffs and dessert sands. Its very stylized, but so was the cartoon but even better than the action is the heart this film had. The films color palette seems to reference Warren Beatty's Dick Tracy film. Instead of following the silver screen trend that sees our comic and cartoon heroes displayed in a world that looks like the one we live in everyday, Speed Racer chooses to stick with the cartoon world.

184,brendon-kenny,Is there the need the need for Speed?,4,19 May 2008,"This Review was originally written for South Yorkshire Newspapers and featured on BBC Radio Sheffield, Leeds, and York - Speed Racer is a labour of love for the Wachowski Brothers; the self confessed geeks behind the Matrix Trilogy have gone to great lengths to realise their vision of the cult 60's cartoon. Right off the starting line the movie establishes its highly stylised visual appeal with a kaleidoscope of psychedelic imagery, (an epileptic's nightmare that warrants warning signs around the cinema) before entering a bubblegum Bladerunner world of neon CGI and real life actors.The plot tracks the aptly named Speed (Emile Hirsch, star of last year's 'Into the Wild') as he strives to fulfil his ambition of winning a futuristic Grand Prix. During a brief prologue it's established that his natural instincts and obsession with high octane racing are instilled from an early age as he rides with his revered elder brother Rex, who we later find has met an unfortunate demise, leaving behind his souped-up 'Mach 5' racing car. As Speed moves up the ranks he must deal with the trappings of his success and face corruption within the sport, as he's pressured into a sponsorship deal by a ruthless corporation who threaten to sully the Racer family name. The story follows a tight racing line, to the point that it feels very much like it's on rails, as the young hero must prove himself against the odds, with the help of his family, friends, and some fantastical driving feats on roller-coaster race tracks.The Racer family are a colourful bunch, headed up by Super Mario look-a-like Pops (John Goodman, who clearly seems to be drawn to cartoon adaptations with this and the Flintstones movie on his CV), Mom (a free-wheeling Susan Sarandon), girlfriend Trixie (Christina Ricci, who looks every bit the wide-eyed cartoon character) and for the kids  the daft comic pairing of Speed's younger brother Spritle (newcomer Paulie Litt) and Chim-Chim the monkey. These two are clearly intended to provide some light relief during the too frequent dialogue-heavy points of the film, playing as close to the exaggerated actions of their animated equivalents as possible.It's unfortunate that in reality this type of visual humour feels ridiculously kitsch and more often than not falls flat. To some extent this criticism can be levelled at all of Speed Racer's characters, the cast are clearly working hard, but raised eyebrows, heartfelt dialogue and heavy-handed moral lessons can only go so far  these are still 2D characters, albeit in a snazzy new 3D world. The brief fight scenes go some way to redeeming this element of the film, being more faithful to the Japanimation origins than they are to the Wachowski's back catalogue, the visuals echoing the dramatic flair of modern day Manga 'toons such as Pokémon and Avatar: the Last Airbender (which, incidentally, is also heading to the big screen in 2010). Speed Racer also bares some similarities to some of Warner Bros' other cartoon franchises, most notably with the dastardly weaponry of Wacky Races and the futuristic family feel of the Jetsons.Considering Andy and Larry Wachowski found fame through their revolutionary 'bullet-time' special effects in the Matrix films, devoting moments of hyper-real focus to fast-paced action, the lack of clarity in this film is a big disappointment. Whilst the film isn't aiming for realism, the impressive explosions and fender-bending vehicular combat are severely undermined by the floating sensation of the cars and the lack of impact when opponents jostle for position. The races convey an intense impression of speed, but it feels disconnected, the audience left blinded by the assortment of motion blurs, light coronas and trailblazing neon effects, it's akin to watching a video game without the benefit of being in control or having the 'off' button within easy reach.Speed Racer is fast, polished and has a style of its own, but there's not a lot under the hood, it has no sense of grip and ultimately it's a really unsatisfying ride. Kids may find it fun but there's more mileage to be had from Iron Man which is also showing now and mixes humour and blockbuster action to much better effect.",Speed Racer

The migraine-inducing visuals and the plodding, pedantic excuse for a plot leave the viewer on the edge of their seat....poised to go 'racing' from the room to avoid this train-wreck, er..uh..car wreck of a bastardization. While I'll admit to a certain fascination with the Wachowski's attempt at showing us something that we'd never seen before, this was just an all-out assault on the senses and the cinematic equivalent of projectile- vomiting a full set of fluorescent face-paints. The acting was perfunctory and I couldn't help but wonder if the kids watching this mess were as confused as I was trying to follow just exactly what time frame we were seeing at any given time. The races and racetracks themselves were just so unrealistic and the constant defying of the laws of physics just sucked all of the tension and danger from these sequences rendering them completely excitement free and moot. I didn't mind so much the over-use of the green screen if it weren't so obvious. I mean, come on movie, I want to suspend my disbelief, but you have to help me! This was a blatant wakeup call for Hollywood- if you insist on dumping truckloads of cash into rehashed ideas, you'd better check with the pre-existing fan base before you just let directors throw any old flashy crap up on the screen.",Speed Racer
188,carolineggordon,"Looks fabulous, story great - loved it!",8,21 June 2008,"What a refreshing change to see some family entertainment totally free of wisecracking animals, loose plots and popular culture back references. This movie just looks so fabulous, they have actually created a future that is just on the cusp of real and unreal, just on the edge of life and computer games, car racing and Nintendo racing, comic books and movies - and the plot does actually have you on the end of your seat. Finally, a movie that breaks the well worn mould and does it with absolute confidence, totally into a future world rich with colour, technology but still ticking by the same old clocks of big business versus the little person. I loved so many details I just can't list them all, but I have to mention the mix of accents, really the world is flat and getting flatter, in the future maybe not everyone has an American accent! The styling was just fabulous, I want to go out and buy a whole new wardrobe of bright red, blue and green. Emile Hersch is just great, finally an actor who can act. Mathew Fox was probably the only weak link in the cast, and with a minor part wearing a mask most of the time it mattered little. I loved the computer game references, especially the A, B, C etc buttons in the car (just like your Wii remote) and all the special weapons they had, straight from Mario Cart! You have to see it on the big screen, now!",Speed Racer
189,dgranger,an adrenaline rush with major flaws.,8,9 May 2008,"I have been a fan of this show since it first air in late 60's and early 70's when it aired in syndicated TV. So, I was eager to see this movie. I knew it was going to be actioned packed, insane stunts, and manic pacing and I wasn't disappointed. This film is an adrenaline rush.*********WARNING THIS IS WHERE THE SPOILERS START*************** It remains true to it's original concept and the characters don't stray that much from the original show except Trixie (played by Christina Ricci). Trixie has a great catty tomboy side to her that is a welcomed addition to the character. There is on scene in the film where she is in the race car and you can see her get excited and aroused by the action and trash on the cars. At the end of it, she displays this little smirk that tells audience that she loves what she is doing. That smirk is worth a billion dollars. Hmmmmmm a girl who loves her work, what we all like.(Don't worry, they do it very cleanly, After all, this is a kids movie. They are not completely insane.)The story is the typical small independent vs the corrupt conglomerate Industrialist bad guy who cheats and breaks the rules storyline. Gee where have we heard this story before???????? It also has another cliché and that is a family dishonored by one of it's family members and seeks to regain the family honor and to foil the cheats. What gives the story depth is the family living with the dishonor and Speed's attempts for personal honor while seeing his naivete being stripped from him. and there is one of the flaws, The mobsters and the mobster drivers. They are all of the worst type of comical stereotype characters possible and not even remotely convincing. There is one scene that was ludicrous of where the Mobsters are in an office with a tank full of Piranhas which turns out to be in the trailer of a semi truck and it is attacked by Racer X in his car. Great effects but unbelievable scene. There is another implausible scene at the beginning of the film where a jet somehow lands in the middle of the street but somehow doesn't trash the lawn. Gladly these implausible parts are all in the early parts of the story but when MR, Royale explains the ""other"" history of racing, the story tightens and the action revs up and makes the film and enjoyable experience.Since this film is based on a cartoon, the colors and the sets are made to invoke the world of the cartoon like when Warren Beatty had the same technique with the colors in the ""Dick Tracy"" film for the same reason. This film has one eye popping visual special effect after another in it so fast and gives the audience little time to rest between effects. All of them are done unbelievably well. Expect this film to be nominated for an Oscar for the shear amount of effects. The film is one long special effect. The races course look like that they come from a video games which was not bad since the film is a cartoon world. In fact, I think one course came out of the race course in the ""Racing The Clock"" episode of ""Reboot"" and another that came out of my Wipeout 64 video game.This film is definitely style over substance.But there is where the other problems come in with the special visual effects. There is one scene at the beginning where Speed is remembering his older brother. At one point he imagines himself behind the wheel of a cartoon car, and there is another point where Speed's brother Rex is standing against a background with fake clouds that was so cheesy that it was pathetic. Then there was these two completely unnecessary special effects shots where Speed's little brother Spindle strikes a martial arts poses and then there is a second or two of him being an Anime character flying through the air attacking someone - dumb. And then there is the talking heads that the Wachowski Brothers had used as wipes across the screen. For those who don't known what a wipe is, it is a stylistic transition change from one shot or scene to another with transitions other than a simple cut. One of the many forms of the wipe is to have an object move from one side of the screen to the other, with the old shot or scene being transitioned from on one side and the new shot or scene on the other side. The object in this case was close ups of talking heads. It happens every five minutes in the film. There must about a hundred of them and it is annoying. After the twenty millionth one, I felt like going over to the Wachowski Brothers house and personally un-install the effects software from their computers and not give it back unless they promise to never use it again. The wipes, the mobsters and the fake clouds are the reason I gave this eight stars and not a full ten. And if I think about it any more, I'll probably lower it even further.I liked everybody's performance, but I was a little disappointed by John Goodman's performance. I felt he could have done Pops a little better.",Speed Racer
190,i_know_i_die,One Hell of a Ride!,9,9 May 2008,"Hornestly, I was really planning to watch Speed Racer. But when I saw that it was directed by Wachowski Brothers, who are the one responsible for Matrix, it just tempted me to watch this film. When I entered the cinema and watch it for the first 15 minutes, I was like 'Wow' this is amazing. It just blew me away.The colorful backgrounds, those cool cars and of course those stunning CGI. Everything was so anime like. If you notice, even the editing has an anime style of editing. It's like watching anime converted to real life! So here's the story, Speed Racer is a racer (Doesn't the name says it all?) who has a racing instinct in his blood. The day after he wins a race, Royalton, the owner of Royalton Industries, offers Speed a chance to work with him to win many races and earing big bucks. Being loyal to his family Speed refuse the deal. And of course Royalton gets mad and wants to destroy Speed.So then Racer X comes and ask Speed to help get Taejo because Taejo has a lot of information about Royalton and his corrupted business. So they entered the Crucible, A cross county racing that killed Speed's brother, Rex. So the must win the race in other to bring down Royalton and his corrupted business.Well, if you seen this movie and didn't notice the background, I suggest you to watch it again and get amaze by the colorful background in each scene. Everything just worked so well together. The art direction, the costume design, the editing and also the CGI.The CGI for those racing sequence are amazing. This time it's Racer's Time. It grabs you to the edge of your seat when you're watching those scenes.I have to say that if you're an anime fan, you will probably notice the kind of editing we usually see in anime. And what could it do without the help of CGI making it more fun to watch. Check out the fight scene at the Crucible scene.Also not forgetting the art direction and the costume design. It just makes the movie filled with interesting and colorful characters.Once again the Wachowski Brothers did it against. Making another great movie. This is a must watch for all anime fans. And a great start if you want to start digging into anime.4.5/5 Stars",Speed Racer
191,pcselect,"Never watched the cartoon, but...",7,20 May 2008,"I'm 45, and I've never watched the original cartoon. I wasn't expecting much except a lot of really cool visuals with hopefully a couple of chuckles and a little plot. I must admit, the first hour or so, I found the movie a little annoying due to the dialog and flashbacks. All of this I guess is faithful to the original cartoon. I did, however, like the main character, his brother and his parents. Susan Sarandon is nice to look at regardless of her age, and John Goodman is fun to watch.that being said, if you can stick it out, and understand that this is based on an anime cartoon, and that dialog and scenes are supposed to be short and shallow, then you can sit back and enjoy the second half of the movie. I actually had a lot of fun during the second half, and had to be careful driving home, as I had a mirthful urge to speed.If you're not sure, see it at a bargain theater, since it gains a lot of appeal on the big screen that it will definitely lose on DVD. Plan on the first 45-60 minutes of the movie as ""acclimation time"" if you've never seen the cartoon. Then clear your mind, enjoy the visuals and root for the underdog ""Speed Racer"", and good family values. If you can do this, you may walk out glad that you saw this movie. I did.",Speed Racer
192,loccomotive2000,Turn off your brain and fire up your heart!,8,19 May 2008,"The Wachowski brothers bring the hit 80s anime series Speed Racer to the silver screen, and man have they done a hell of a job.It was clear from the very first frame of the movie that the whole thing was meant to be ""cartoonish"" and not at all realistic, so I can't really understand all the complains that the scenes and background looked ""fake"". It is exactly this tone of the movie that the Wachowskis have set which brings it closer to the heart, for anyone who had watched the TV series. I'm at best a moderate fan of the original, but I was nothing less than thrilled with this fantastic update/conversion.Without the pressure of having to instill philosophic undertones in the film like they almost always do in their previous movies, the Wachowskis, along with Joel Silver, go full power on designing some of the most exhilarating CGI action sequences I have ever seen, much less a race sequence. After providing us with the extravagant shootout and the mind-blowing Burly Brawl from the Matrix series, the bros. once again displayed savant-like skills in using their creativity and plotting out amazing ""car-fights"" and the usage of a wide array of gadgets, which fans will be pleased to find out that most were taken straight from the original series.In terms of acting, the film has a talented cast. Emile Hirsch thankfully wasn't much like the animated titular character in his portrayal, and fitted in perfect in this updated universe from the anime. The rest of the cast were modeled from head to toe to look like their animated counterparts. Even Hollywood newcomer, South Korea's pop star Rain (RAAAAAIN!) does a competent job for a blockbuster movie debut.With all the regard for realism, few people may be able to enjoy this movie. But for those who did, like me, will have to consider ourselves truly blessed to have experienced this nostalgic hell of a ride. We clicked.",Speed Racer
193,kitano0,Surprisingly great!,8,3 February 2009,"After all the negative reviews of this film, I was expecting a cheesy storyline and loud, stupid action. Not at all. This is close to a revolutionary motion picture. Incredible use of CGI and every other technology, great actors, and a moral to boot! Part of the reason we go to the movies is for them to take us to a different place...boy, does this one do the trick. From its hyper color palate, to frenetic racing action that you can actually make sense of (Bourne folks, take note) it is a winner all the way. I mean, some of the scenes actually look 3-D! If you want an exciting, entertaining movie experience, I strongly recommend Speed Racer! I only wish I had seen it at the cinema, which I probably would if the reviews had been better. I am seriously concerned about our new crop of movie critics when a movie,a family movie as good as this, gets such lukewarm reviews. Everybody seems to need to lighten up!",Speed Racer
194,Fritz_Gerlich,Overloaded Overstimulating Oversaturated Overboard and You've GOT to See it On the Big Screen,9,14 May 2008,"This is the most intense movie I have ever seen. It's not intense because the story is a high power drama full of tension, but intense because it takes the elements of cgi action movies and turns the knob to 11. Everything is taken to the extreme: the colors, the sounds, the action, everything. This movie is an adrenaline rush of epic proportions and its a shame the reviews just couldn't handle it. Maybe they're too old, I don't know. But then again I'm in my thirties, so I'm no youngster. Hell, I remember a time before the internet. But seriously, you really should go see this movie as it is a unique experience that you probably won't forget. And this is doublely true if you live near an IMAX theater, which is where I saw this movie. The giant screen and killer sound-system just made this movie so overwhelming, it was almost too much. The only downside to seeing this movie, is when you leave the theater the real world will seem so drab and gray by comparison. No joke, but I thought it was foggy outside when I left the theater (it wasn't).Again, don't miss this event as it really has to be seen on the big screen to be appreciated",Speed Racer
195,Rack-Focus,Turbo Charged Family Fun will Win Big at the Box Office,6,4 May 2008,"""Speed Racer"" will probably be one of the summer's top grossing movies, making it a must see.I saw ""Speed"" at the second sold out screening at the Tribeca Film Festival. The advance ticket line stretched down a New York block, the audience clapped and cheered, leaving excited and talkative.Why the buzz? Speed appeals to same preteen group that watched the original cartoon, giving it almost no competition this summer.A lot of parents bought their children to my screening  the moms and dads there to remember  the kids to see the kaleidoscope of sound and color and to laugh at Spritle and the monkey Chim Chim, whose antics got the chuckles.Neither group left disappointed, though serious film-goers will be.""Speed"" includes everything from the past  from Trixie's helicopter to the gadgets on the Mach 5. It's all packaged in a family safe way. The racing looks like a Hot Wheels video game on steroids so none of the violence (or racing) seems real and the drivers (at least the good ones) escape death by ejecting in little balls.What ""Speed"" lacks is something new.The Brothers Wachowski offer no stunning visual breakthroughs as they did with ""bullet time"" in ""The Matrix."" We've seen the film's look in ""Spy Kids,"" ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas,"" and ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.""Meantime, we learn nothing more about the Speed Racer saga. The characters have even less depth than in the cartoon and there's almost no plot  only a vague storyline about whether Speed should sell out his Pops company to a multi-national sponsor.So in the end, all this movie will do is make million of dollars for Warner Brothers, a unit of Time Warner, the world's largest media company - ironic for a movie that preaches independence from big business.",Speed Racer

When I sat down opening night in the sadly half empty theater, it felt like I was 9 years old again! Speed Racer is a wonderful, WONDERFUL film. Its a heartfelt family story with a bit of cartoon sensibility. I'd even go as far to compare it with a Pixar Flick. I think the problem with no one seeing this is that, well, many people forget what its like to be a kid. The sense of WOW apparently dies out after the age of 15 and if its not a a tear jerking fest or something that a certain director does, its gets poo poo'd on big time.I would recommend this film to both children and adults, as, besides Pixar, there aren't many films that a child and parent can sit down and enjoy together..

If viewed with your family, I could see how some entertainment could be had, but this film is in no way worth repeating. Apart from the non stop migraine inducing effects, a plot is bordering on non existent, paired with one of the most uncreative ending twists I've seen in a film in a long time. Mindless fun is clearly what they were going for, but the confusion outlasts the aggravating imagery by a long shot. While The Matrix was innovative in the effects department, Speed Racer is overly bright and flashy.

""The Matrix"" was a turning point in the action genre,with an incredibly effective plot and spectacular action sequences, then the second movie of the series was an improvement on the first in terms of special effects quality but poor on the plot (same old story), i prefer not to comment the third movie (Matrix: Revolutions) that, in my personal point of view, was a total c**p... ""V for Vendetta"" was a booooooring film, nothing compared to other superhero movies, and so it came this ""Speed Racer""....uhmmm... Well, the movie is well crafted, with originality in the photography. Stop. That's all. The story is abysmal that also a kid could invent playing with his toy cars. The whole look of the movie is ridiculous with acid-pop colors and an absurd family (never watched the original anime, fortunately..). The special effects in the races are so phony that it's like watching a bad-looking Playstation game, and the cars behave like they're Micromachines with acid colors. Bad special effects do the rest. And what's the point with the fat boy and the monkey??? Should they be funny? Ah, OK, it's the FUNNY MOMENT of the movie, sure.. In fact there's a scene where the fat boy and the monkey steals candies from a candy machine on an airplane and then they fall asleep!!HHOHOHOH...so funny...and it's not over: after that the fat boy and the monkey steal a little car in the Evil Manager Fabric and they run everywhere..HAHAHAHAHA...oh God, isn't funny???.....please....

But I did enjoy this film.Despite the negative reviews from what seems like every critic and his/her mother, I found that this film was still fun and entertaining. Of course it also has so many vibrant (and arguably unnecessary) colors thrown at you every step of the way that one will feel tempted to go into a seizure. However, (that said) the utter lack of reality of the story is so purposeful in this film that it makes its own statement: this is a cartoon. It is meant to be taken as a cartoon. Anyone who takes it too seriously will most probably be highly disappointed.In short: this ain't no ""realistic"" story like Iron Man.

Neon, explosions and so much blue screen that at times it doesn't even look like a real movie and more like a video game one can play on their computer. I had higher expectations for this movie for the simple fact I grew up watching the short lived cartoon. The car itself is a dream car that makes me drool. The acting is o.k. The plot very cartoon like. The little brother and the pet monkey (for comic relief no doubt), just don't seem to fit the big screen as good as they did in the cartoon. Its pretty to look at and listen to but for some reason it just seems to be TOO digital to be taken as an actual MOVIE.

203,jonnyk12,A Childish Bit of Fun,7,19 May 2008,"Best Bit: The Races Worst Bit: All the business type scenesYou might know that Speed Racer is the English adaptation of a Japanese anime called Mach GoGoGo, or maybe you didn't anyway these stories follow the life of a guy called Speed Racer, if you think that name is strange just think that should mean that the Japanese guys called Mach GoGoGo, who basically races with automobiles. Although that's just a guess for what happens in the series'.Now, this film just starts straight away, like it's trying to get rid of most of back story ASAP. Which was fine. As it got rid of the back story with style. The story follows with Speed played by Emile Hirsch and his family including John Goodman as Pops and Christina Ricci as his fit girlfriend Trixie, who are all apart of his racing career. So it's all going fine and dandy until everybody starts to notice he's something special on the race track, and that means that everyone wants to have Speed on there team. So after some quite boring business talk, the best parts of the film finally start to kick in with some awesome race scenes. So the with some more business stuff and then more races the film ends with a predictable but enjoyable and nice ending.I'm going to be honest and say that there are some incredibly unbelievably childish moments, mainly because there's a monkey in it, but it's a children's film so that's forgivable and my fault, you'll know when you see them. So this brings me to my next point that this film has some proper business talking parts, that I honestly think that kids will not understand one bit, the fact that they go on for a bit makes these parts extra boring. Hell, I don't know what shares are good and what shares are bad. A couple more things, there are some really random scenes and some characters which seem to have no importance.As for the acting, it was all good enough I think is the best way to put it. Most of the time the acting consisted of facial expressions from the seat of the car or a clip with a voice over. Also it was good to see Matthew Fox in yet another big film as well - lost is brilliant. That's the only thing I can really say about it.Like I've said already, the best parts of this film are the races. Mainly because of the incredible special effects, the lighting and the colours are somewhat strange but brilliant. When I first saw the effects I thought they looked to shiny and to rounded everywhere but that's understandable as, I will say again, it's a very childish film. Which for me was quite surprising from the directors of Matrix.Overall I thought this film was enjoyable at parts, simply childish at parts and just amazing CGI. Am not quite sure whether to recommend this film as people like so many different types of films these days I can recommend it to kids, I pretty much went through boredom. To sum it up in one sentence a childish bit of fun. Does that sound wrong?",Speed Racer
204,zachmoats,The Wachowskis's Commitment to Speed Racer Cartoon Pays Off,8,5 December 2017,"When I first saw The Matrix, I was absolutely taken by the visuals. I admired how complex the plot was, but thought it fell short of meeting the expectations set forth by its ideas. Those thoughts just deepened as I made my way through the trilogy of films. Now, I will say I absolutely want to revisit them, but I could never shake the feeling that the writing of the Wachowskis's was too self-serious. Speed Racer does not have that problem and it is all the better for it.The fact that Speed Racer never takes itself too seriously, in addition to the Wachowskis's commitment to the aesthetic of the Speed Racer cartoon, makes the film worth giving a shot. I will admit that if you do not like CGI, you likely are not going to enjoy this film. I will also say that I am not sure I have seen a movie that used this much CGI as effectively and as fun as Speed Racer does. The racing scenes are awe- inspiring for the spectacle of colors and movement and the fight scenes lie somewhere between exciting and ridiculous never giving into a dull moment. For better or worse during the film, I couldn't take my eyes off the screen, and that is one of the highest praises I can give to any movie.",Speed Racer
205,soporific,Revolutionary film-making,10,10 November 2008,"There is no other movie that i can watch bits of that brings tears to my eyes. And i'm pretty sure its the whole package and not just one aspect of the film that does this. The combination of dialog, plot, and cinematography just kicks ass AND its a PG13 movie.OK, lets talk about WHY this movie was made. Does anyone think it was made just for the money? Glad there's nobody that stupid. But was it made ONLY as a homage to the original Speed Racer? No again. The Wachowski brothers saw an opportunity to make a hugely exciting and original film that explores the concept of being so good at a particular skill that a fair description of it is magic or art. In this case, the skill in question is driving. The style of the film (lots of colour and anime thrown in where possible) embellishes this focus.Combine this with the usual anti-capitalist themes the Wachowski brothers throw in to all their films (eg, doing things for money is bad, m'kay?) and its not hard to build a obstacle-laden plot that our hero must traverse to make it to the finish line. Some people are complaining about the plot, but i can't for the life of me see what's wrong - it serves to highlight the themes of the movie extremely well. If i must make a criticism it would be that the morals of the film are laid on with a bit of a trowel but as i understand that this is a movie for EVERYONE, i can cut the directors some slack when they are trying to make sure EVERYONE gets the point.The last thing i would say is that, for me, i can define my friends by this movie. Anyone who isn't tempted to yell out 'Go, Speed Racer, go!' (i said tempted, you don't have to embarrass yourself like i did) is no friend of mine. If you weren't inclined to yell this out, please check you have a pulse.I just don't hand out 10/10s willy nilly. If you give a movie the highest rating you are saying movies don't get any better. I find it highly ironic that in the same way Speed Racer (the character) would get a 10 for his driving skill, the Wachowski brothers deserve the same for their movie making. If i could give them a score 2 or 3 points higher than everyone else, then i would have to award 12 or 13 out of 10. A pity i can't. What ... a ... movie.",Speed Racer

I went to see this this movie in IMAX theater in Toronto, to see it best possible resolution and sound, such a waist of money and time. I have to say that I knew about this movie during it's post production, I was ready and waiting for it. Even visual effects were really bad, looks very cheap, just a bunch of cuts stitched together; it's like if TV show cuts, shots from home made music video, video game cuts and green screen footage shots were edited together by drunk dude. Totally underused Susan Sarandon, very confusing movie, super cheesy flick with lots of flashes, I even felt dizzy. Probably Wachowski got lazy after Matrix, they made this movie to get some fresh cash by advertising ""from directors of Matrix"", shame on you Wachowski. Although, 3 things were good, Christina Ricci always beautiful, 13 y/o Paulie Litt done really great acting, and car 3D models looks very good. Rest of the movie is just a garbage, simply trash...",Speed Racer
209,fredlondi,"An ambitious, but brutally flawed movie *SPOILERS*",3,1 May 2018,"The animated ""Speed Racer"" is one of the most notoriously silly and corny cartoons ever conceived. The characters are two-dimensional, the plots are little more than ""win the race, defeat the villain,"" and the English dubs are so notoriously hilarious that they've been mocked in everything from ""Family Guy"" to ""Dexter's Laboratory.""It was surprising, then, that the live action ""Speed Racer"" was so needlessly complicated. First, the audience is expected to understand the difference between an ""off-road race,"" for which the Mach 5 can be used, and some fantastical loop-de-loop superspeedways, where the Mach 5 is apparently too out-of-date, replaced by a ""Mach 6."" What's strange is that the Mach 6 isn't introduced as a replacement to the Mach 5 - in fact, the Mach 6 is destroyed early in the film, then completely rebuilt. I don't understand why this couldn't have been done with the Mach 5 instead. The Mach 5 stands as the most important character in the original cartoon. All of the aforementioned characters are merely a means of showing off its awesomeness. The film should've done the same, not brush it off as a relic compared to the Mach 6.Second, the villain's plot is entirely too dense - even by modern Anime standards. Something about stocks, and corporations fielding drivers with the specific intent of making their companies more money, yet somehow not caring about racing. Something about helping another guy get money for his company. I couldn't honestly tell you what the story should've been about. Why not just do the same thing the cartoon did: bad guy wants to win a race, Speed needs to beat him. The complexity would've been restricted to the characters themselves, which would've been fine. They're basically blank slates from the cartoon - just make them more interesting.The underlying hilarity behind the film's complexity as that the film itself yearns for simplicity. One of the film's best scenes is where Pops Racer recalls a night where he and a young Speed start cheering at a race they're watching on TV. On top of this, the effects are just dreadful. Like ""Phantom Menace""-tier. One of the first shots is Rex Racer standing in front of the Mach 5, and you can tell he's just some guy in an empty room leaning against a green-painted rectangle. The action sequences feel like Hot Wheels commercials - certainly not a coincidence given the company marketed the film. There's also no grit, no teeth, no consequence to the action. The spectacular crashes and explosions from the cartoon are dulled by a ridiculous safety feature where drivers are launched to safety in foam cocoons. At least that's what seemed to happen - the CGI battles are so fast and overwhelming that it's hard to tell what's happening.On top of this, the character designs are awful. Why was Snake Oiler turned from some mysterious guy in a black suit with ridiculous glasses into some drunk leather-clad cowboy?What almost singlehandedly saves the film is Matthew Fox, who plays Racer X. My goodness, he absolutely owned that part. While Emile Hirsch was brought on just because he looked like Speed Racer, Fox took on the role of Racer X and quite literally became him. He carries himself with such tortured seriousness that every moment he's on screen is just golden. Watch a supercut of his scenes and you'll enjoy it.As for the rest of the film? Meh. Couldn't help but be disappointed, and this is from someone who watches actual racing. Make no mistake, there's real passion behind the making of this film, and it's clear a lot of work was put into it. I'll take that over some rubber-stamped superhero film any day. I just wish more of that effort was used in the script, character design, and effects. It's just frustrating because one more revision of the script before shooting could've saved it.",Speed Racer

212,frank-glinski,Poor Susan Sarandon,1,11 May 2008,"This movie sucks big time. The only good thing about it is that it was financed through Germany, and no real movie maker was disturbed in Hollywood - they shot the whole piece in the old GDR, in Potsdam. Whatever, everything is trash about it, the story, the characters, the actors, the ""animation"" which looked like originally aired in the GDR, and of course the uninspired blablabla-directing by the brothers... - one of them only visited the set in complete drag..okay, what a shame that the movie is so uninspired, cold and heartless, perhaps next time he should wear nothing at all - if you like good comic/anime-adaptations try Batman Begins or Sin City, even Spi Kids 1-3 here better, even Xanadu... piece of trash - I hope it flops big time!",Speed Racer

Although the plot is not logical or linear, neither is seeing a movie you know you will hate just so you can vent abut it on IMDb. Leaving comments about movies is supposed to help people decide whether or not to see it. If the user comments are loaded with biased negative ones, it doesn't give the movie goer a fair chance.I read one comment in particular where the person said they didn't even like the original speed racer series. WHY WOULD YOU THEN GO TO A MOVIE ABOUT IT? DO YOU ENJOY WASTING TIME AND MONEY? My suggestion to the preemptive haters is this: save 2 hours and $7.50 and leave a comment saying ""my friend told me it sucked.""",Speed Racer
214,SaintedSons,"Speed Racer: Right Idea, Wrong Time",6,21 January 2019,"Gotta say being a fan of the Japanese animation classic from 1967, I was definitely interested in this film. After watching, I thought the film was cast very well and appreciated the idea. Unfortunately for fans it was a bit of a letdown. It had a lot of CGI, which ultimately was what was needed but the graphics were too cartoonish. Whether or not that was the idea or not, it did not suit the film whatsoever. The technology was not up to par when the film came out. We would love to see it get a reboot with the current CGI available today(2019). The film did have its moments, especially with the cast in it, but Hollywood took some liberties it shouldn't have such as the car. On the outside it looked pretty good, but other details were disappointing. It's definitely worth a watch for diehards but this film falters due to the CGI of the time.",Speed Racer
215,abacaba,Maybe the best movie ever,10,2 August 2014,"This is the first time I've cared enough about a movie to post a review. I saw this as the first BluRay film and was blown away. Later, it came on cable and we recorded it on our DVR. My family watched this film 6 times the first week. I've seen it 2 or 3 times since. Each time, I see more and more and love this film more and more.This movie is sheer cinematic joy. The film work, the effects, the stunning transitions from scene to scene are sheer eye- and brain-candy. The acting is brilliant from each and every character in this film, especially young Spritle.The film is full of genuine laughs, action and heart-warming drama. This is a film you should see at least twice, with your whole family.Interesting that this film gets only a mediocre rating on IMDb. Half the reviews are 9-10, and the other half are low. I guess you either get it or you don't. If you go into this film expecting something fun and beautiful with a fantastic deep plot and brilliant acting, you will be one of the 9-10 reviewers!My only disappointment is that there is not yet a sequel. We want more!Go Speed Racer, Go!",Speed Racer
216,LinksPopcornPicks,Highly Underrated!,8,8 August 2008,"-Theres something thats been bothering me about the recent talk about ""Speed Racer"". Its has been getting panned like no tomorrow and it doesn't deserve the hideous reviews its been getting. By no means is it a perfect movie, it has its flaws. And its certainly no masterpiece, but thats not what it was designed to be. My theory with ""Speed Racer"" is that the critics don't understand the charm and tone of the movie. The problem is, is that they walk in expecting another movie and this one is simply not that movie. The movie that was made was faithfully reminiscent to the classic 60's ""Speed Racer"" cartoons. Most of the critics obviously never watched the cartoons.The film is just like the series. The action, the campy jokes, the cars, the villains, and especially the characters. -When I first heard of a ""Speed Racer"" movie I thought it was a terrible idea. Its difficult to translate cartoons to live-action, but anime is another thing completely. The first thing that the Wachowskis do right to pull off this task is establish the world in which the film takes place. Its a very colorful, strange, futuristic setting. The film works better than a more realistic world given the ridiculousness of the cartoons. Its its own thing. -Another thing worth noting is the casting. The cool thing about the actors in this flick is how each one of the characters matches the original characters from the series. I was afraid that they would just pick some random guy and call him Speed Racer or Pops. Movies like ""UnderDog"" do this. They create the character and give him or her JUST the title of the character and not the personality. Each actor both resembles and has the vibe of the particular person they are playing -Okay, this is where the critics really start hating the movie. The mafia, the over-the-top villain, the cgi races. Its a racing movie, and thats all what they think it should be, perhaps with some form of an antagonist. Why is there a mafia in ""Speed Racer? Why are the cars so futuristic and totally unrealistic? That my friends is the spirit of the old series. Sure, ""Speed"" might be a little longer than it should be, but the thing that concerned me the most was from early reviews that the film would have no heart. Story elements from flashbacks and the current time stream with the characters in the movie give the film the heart I wanted. Yup, Corny villains, violence, cool races, and sweet characters. Thats exactly what this movie is, and it doesn't need-no, strike that. It shouldn't be any more or any less. A very solid B+",Speed Racer
217,benovite,"""Racing is a religion"" - And THAT is where the film fails",1,8 June 2009,"I tried watching this movie yesterday and when there was more than a merciless hour left I had to stop the madness. Although there was some initial interest in it because of the absurdly strong visual aspect, this is one of those movies in which at some point I had to loudly announce, ""ENOUGH. I HAVE WASTED ENOUGH TIME IN MY LIFE ON THIS PIECE OF ****.""I haven't had many reactions like that to a movie, but this is a rare exception. I mean often films are so bad that they are good in a wacky kinda way.This movie is just bad. Awful bad. Life tearing out my eyeballs, filling the sockets with salt and vinegar, then putting my eyeballs back in bad.FIRST of all, it takes itself Way way Way too seriously.I mean come on! It's a frig-gin' SPEED RACER movie, not a BIBLICAL EPIC minus Charlton Heston! When ""Speed"" says something to the big corporate mogul guy about how racing is a religion in his family- THAT is where the film utterly gets the entire concept of Speed Racer WRONG.It's not that serious folks! Lighten up! There are numerous, painful moments of complete seriousness that, at least this movie tries to achieve, but completely fail because the source material is something entirely different from what this movie is. They shouldn't have even called it Speed Racer, maybe something like Overstuffed Racer or something. I know the Whatchamacallem Brothers love to infuse spirituality in their movies(Matrix), but the seriousness in which this movie takes the Speed Racer cartoon is absurd. And it's simply not fun as result.Now let's move on to the visuals, because lord(and Speed) knows that this movie is the visual equivalent of EVERYTHING AND THE KITCHEN SINK.How many bright colors and moving objects can they place in a single frame? Not enough apparently!It's the visual equivalent of HR Puffinstuf throwing up and filming it. It's completely overblown and overdone, and not in a fun way but in an annoying, bizarre, drugged out LSD-on-heroin-on-mushrooms-on-pot way. It'll give you a hangover about 30 minutes in!It's as if Tim Burton, Laz Lurhhman and Satan spawned a child that made this movie. I kept expecting to see Barbie and Ken driving the cars. Remember that ""Barbie Girl"" music video from a group called Aqua? Well this is the epic expanded version.But enough with the visuals(even though I'll be haunted by them for years to come). Let's talk about the acting(OK I talk you listen). It's pretty bad because again, EVERYONE TAKES THIS **** WAY TOO SERIOUSLY.Besides that, how many frig-gin' huge closeups can I watch of the bloated and dyed John Goodman? Not enough according to the Whatever Brothers apparently. Oh and the bloated corporate English pig? Again, not enough. We need to see these big, fat bloated faces on screen a lot- because that's what Speed Racer was all about. Susan Sarandon- had enough of her big old bot-ox face too. Besides that grotesque visual aspect- they all seem terribly bored with their roles, because you know what? THEY PROBABLY WERE. This is one of those 'cash the paycheck movies' for these guys. Just do it, get the check and shut up.Those transitions with big actors heads got really old fast too. Been done too many times in other movies, nothing new here except to drag the idea and beat it with a dead horse.Actually, everything got really old and really fast in this movie. That was the only time the filmmakers were able to convey some sense of speed, because otherwise it was all one big unrealistic video game.I could go on, and I dare say that film courses in colleges should dissect this movie for educational purposes pertaining to how NOT to make an adaptation.I'm sure three year-old might like the whiz-bang of it all, but anyone over that age should avoid this- no scratch that, actually go out of your way to watch Speed Racer to see what utter crap Hollywood turns out these days.Just don't blame me if you want to commit suicide because you can't get the time or money you spent on this movie back.Thanks, Whatchamacallem Brothers! Now go back to flipping burgers or something else constructive besides polluting movie screens with this garbage.",Speed Racer
218,evolbaby,What the heck happened here????,3,8 November 2008,"I may be brutal but as an original fan of the Speed Racer TV series and the original Manga series, I was much disappointed in this highly anticipated send up.Let's start with one word: COLOR!!!! This movie looks like it was shot in Girlievision! Like someone's little girl got hold of a computer and went berserk. I didn't know whether to watch the movie or wait for a makeup lady to come rushing down the theatre isles trying to slabby the latest lip gloss on everything moving.The basic characters are here that we love but their direction is so off and the dialogue so way off base that at times I was hoping a TV commercial would appear so I could see something interesting.The car designs were outstanding and the concept of wild track designs very thrilling but the story was so badly illustrated that I kept losing interest. Somehow the directors must have forgotten they were supposed to direct the actors to bring the characters to life by being the characters we've loved for 50 years. Speed was the main character's nickname. He used to have a big 'G' on his shirt which stood for the name Gen and later Greg in the English versions of the series. Sure there had to be compromises like Spritel and Chim Chim hiding in the trunk of a car. Okay for the 60's but would be dangerous for kid's today to see. The original series had stories that were often far superior to even major motion pictures and published novels. Some were so profound that they're still talked about with reverence to this day.The cast was just fine, it's just that I don't think they ever watched the show. If so, they didn't get directed properly. They only came to life during the comedy scenes. John Goodman as Pops Racer was a gem of a choice as was Susan Sarandon as Moms Racer. In the TV series Moms Racer was always a voice of sanity and calm coming from an apron. Pops was hot tempered but a genius and proud but haunted soul. The addition of Rex Racer gave the show more depth and the threat of death at every turn kept the show on edge all the way. No big bubble balloons that rescued drivers.However I did like the car combat. That was like being in a Hot Wheels crash car set and that pushed the movie into a new cool realm.So of course it will be a part of my DVD library because of my love of the characters but it's not Speed Racer. If they revive some of the classic stories and let the actors 'be' the characters ( Inspector Detector never was a glum guy but jeeez, this movie had him acting like he was on psychiatric drugs ) then we'd have cool designs and great characters.There's no excuse not to have a Speed Racer live film franchise since it's got 50 years of fans behind it but you have to remember, it's about racing and racing isn't pretty, it's a brutal sport calling for nerves of steel and a level of courage that few have. That's what made the show great because it showed the value of honesty, courage, integrity and at least the film got that in there but it took second place to bad directing.Maybe better luck next time.",Speed Racer
219,Nicol_Bolas,Purity and Shamelessness,6,3 August 2009,"There are so many movie adaptations of other media that are ashamed of their source material. They want to run away as fast as possible from what the source material was. In some cases, this means dropping minor aspects of the original. In other cases, this means changing the entire tone of a work.Take The Dark Knight. For all of its greatness, it isn't a Batman film. Indeed, it would probably have had more verisimilitude if they'd called the character ""The Vigilante"" or some such. Every time the word ""Batman"" is uttered, the film seems to lose its tone. Batman is reduced to an artifact in his own movie, an echo of an unwanted element in this serious character study/action film.Speed Racer is completely without shame for its source material. This is Speed Racer in live-action. The world is clean and pure, the racing scenes are absolutely over-the-top (even moreso than in the cartoon, if you can believe that), and even the characters are broad and dramatic. It is, in a word, pure.No attempt is made to cover up the fact that a family with the last name ""Racer"" had a child that they decided to give the first name ""Speed"". This is introduced, and the audience is to either accept it or move on to something else. Speed's brother has a pet chimpanzee; this is introduced and the audience is expected to accept it or leave. The whole movie is like this.There is nothing quite like a film that knows what it's trying to achieve and lets nothing stand in the way of achieving that. This film sets out to make live-action Speed Racer, and it succeeds. If that interests you, check it out.",Speed Racer

221,pat-pat,Great special effects! Bad movie :(,4,13 May 2008,"Well the creators of the matrix have tried their hand at directing something new. However I'm sad to say its not very good. The movies biggest problem is its script, its about as good as a Saturday morning YU-GI-OH! cartoon. And hey i know this film is supposed to be campy but come on. The second problem, this movie is wayyyyy to long for a kids movie, I'm sure kids will start to figit once the movie trys to be smart by bringing up issues of the racing biz and thanks to the awful script it falls flat on its face. I could go on about the movies other problems such as Speed's annoying little bro and his chimp and the bland characters, but this film does have one redeeming quality,the special effects. The movie looks great from the racing scenes to the color palate, the Wachowski's know their special effects. i recommend u wait for the film to come out on DVD and rent it, so u can fast forward through the crappy dialog and watch the races.",Speed Racer
222,Ytadel,A weak story but bizarre and fascinating visual experience,6,2 December 2010,"Speed Racer was a box office disaster, a Treasure Planet-level whoopsie that crashed and burned and lost millions of dollars for WB. Is this a shame? Perhaps. It's definitely not a great movie - it may not even be a good one - but I can honestly say that I was entertained while watching it (call this the Transporter 2 effect), if only because it's one of the only truly visually unique movies I've seen in the last several years. It did not look like ANYTHING else I've seen. Everything popped with a hyper-saturated, tripped-out, color-drowned brilliance, with the whole neon, glowing frame constantly sharp and in focus. It was like being force- fed Starburst through your eyeballs. It was insane but it was original.The flaw lies in the story, plot, characters, and humor - all migrated directly from Saturday morning cartoon land; wafer-thin, silly, unoriginal, uninspired. When the characters talk it's more or less a waste of time, outside of John Goodman, because John Goodman is cool. But this ain't a drama, and it's in the corny action scenes - the ridiculousness of race cars firing missiles at each other, dodging enemy attacks, jumping over chasms, flipping and spinning - that the meat of the film lies, and whether or not you can enjoy it leans on whether or not it bothers you that this is all basically a cartoon with no regard for physics or reality. My inner child loves that stuff, so I was able to accept it for what it was an have a fun time.It's your call, but if you decide to watch Speed Racer, make it a Blu-ray on the biggest television you can find. Without its visuals, it's nothing.",Speed Racer
223,murphmeister75,A Brave New World...,5,11 May 2008,"I'm not sure there has ever been a movie like Speed Racer. And what continues to baffle me is how this movie ever got green-lighted.The original Speed Racer, which ran for only a short time, was basically a campy sixties cartoon that lived on as cult television. Forty years after the show was made, thirty since it was popular in the US, and fourteen years after its aborted television revival, the reboot hits our screens. Most of its original audience are far too old to cope with the epilepsy inducing visuals and MTV speed editing. Who is this movie aimed at? I should make a point here. All of Speed Racer's achievements are technical: the visuals are nothing short of staggering, when seen on high-grade digital projection. See this movie on the biggest, best screen you can, because by the time it hits DVD it will lose a lot. Even on a mammoth TV - trust me, what's left when you strip away the visuals is a shocking shambles of a film.And before you moan ""It's meant to be corny!"" or ""It's for kids!"", I'm not attacking the bizarre stylised dialogue and campy acting.The story's too complex. The film is miles too long - at least sixty minutes or more. The casting is crazy - check out Spy Kids if you want to know how to fill roles like Racer X, because an actor like Matthew Fox is absolutely wrong. Goodman, Sarandon and Ricci do better, and Emile Hirsch is actually plastic enough to fit in with the rest of the synthetic visuals.Ultimately, I can see huge appeal for the video game generation here and no one else. They're accustomed to horrible cut-scene acting, bad dialogue and having to spend hours waiting for the grand finale. And as risible as this film is, and butt-numbing as its length is, the visual achievement from the Wachowski Brothers is landmark. If you're serious about cinema, you must see this film in IMAX, or large-scale digital projection. See it to get a glimpse at the visual potential of the future.Let's just hope it has a better script.",Speed Racer

I saw it and I was happy to notice that everything was respected : Pops Racer, who's perfectly interpreted by John Goodman, and Spritle, along with Chim-Chim are like in the original(by the way, there's a small resemblance between Goodman and this young actor).Lovely Christina Ricci and cool Susan Sarandon gives a female warm touch to this full action race and what about Hirsh and the other young male cast ? And the villains ? As in the comics !!! They said that it was the same brothers who did Matrix trilogy, that adapted Speed Racer ??? Matrix was a complete waste of time ! It was boring !Speed Racer is a fun entertainment : for those who underrated this movie, you needed to know the minimum of the series first, in order to understand the ""over reacted"" gestures of Spritle, why a monkey, why the slow but intense relation between Speed and Trixie... only thing, Pops didn't swing around (over one foot) when he's furious, but Goodman is a good Man (and actor), so I'll forgive that one !

I had to force myself from leaping to my feet and yelling ""Go, Speed, Go"" during the two key races in the film.The Wachowskis have managed to adapt a cartoon production into a cartoony live-action film. DO NOT go into this film expecting realism, if that's what you are after skip ""Speed Racer"" it is over-the-top, outlandish, and in complete violation of the rules of physics, but IT IS BASED ON A CARTOON!

228,megatom5,A great underrated family film,8,1 September 2008,"Growing up I used to watch the speed racer cartoon mostly for humor as it's campy yet lovable tone was always fun to watch. I have to say that this was captured perfectly in the new film. While many critics have panned this film, I found it to be a good all around family film. Everyone has seen or knows of speed racer's camp value, I think if you were to try and look at this film as it own entity it might fall flat on it's face. Yet taken in the context of the series it's a great continuation. The performance are all handled well, Emil Hersch is particularly good in the titular role. The only part to rag on is the role of Spritle but he was always annoying, and that's generally his character. Something almost must be said about the art direction. I've heard many people complain that the CGI looks bad, on the contrary it is given a cartoon look for a reason, which is simply that it wants to emulate a cartoon. I think that would be the best description of this movie is a live action cartoon, similar to The Mask but turned up to 11. All in all this is possibly the best thing the Wachowski Bros have done since the original matrix. I'm glad to see they are capable of handling different material other than philosophy thick scifi (not that there is anything wrong with that).",Speed Racer
229,ptb4life,Go Speed Racer Go! (very original Review title!),9,6 October 2008,"I saw all the trailers and all the commercials... and was unimpressed. I read more than enough reviews....they were mixed, but a larger % was negative. That was enough to get me to avoid the movie when it was in theaters.... But I couldn't resist giving it a try when it came to BluRay last week. Other than watching a demo disk for how good a BluRay movie could look, I really didn't have any expectations. So that's how I came into the movie. And yes, it is a beautifully looking movie (you might not like the style....but the picture is pretty perfect!)...but what really surprised me was how much I loved the movie! Now normally I am the kind of person who thinks a movie can't be judged unless watched from beginning to end, but I think it's pretty safe to say that if you watch the first 20-30 minutes of Speed Racer, and are hating it...it's not going to win you over. But if you do enjoy that first part, I think you'll come out of it pretty much like I did, with a big smile on your face.I like that the movie isn't cynical, and doesn't make fun of the source material. I like the family dynamic that they portray. I like the action too. I pretty much liked everything in the movie except for Speed's little brother Spritle. UGH. I'm not saying he's JarJar bad, but he's pretty bad and drags the movie to a hault whenever he is on screen (not to mention, completely ruining the ending scene for me).Anyways, I really liked the movie, and think that ANYONE with a BluRay player should give it a try. If you only have DVD, hopefully you'll like the story enough to still enjoy it without all the fancy shiny visuals.P.S. I am pretty sure this movie didn't come out in 3D or IMAX....that's a shame, cause it would have been amazing!",Speed Racer
230,FreakNumberOne,"Be fun, don't be too cool for this film",8,3 February 2015,"Sit down, suspend your disbelief, and watch this visually insane and surprisingly affecting film. In the spirit of the classic anime, it's full of fun characters like Snake Oiler and Inspector Detector, cool cars, ridiculous racing, and a warm family core. At the very least, you have to appreciate this as an exercise in fearless film-making. The visual vocabulary of the cuts and pans and wipes, the way the characters move in and out of frame, is incredibly unique and original. And it's, shockingly, mostly successful. This got lost among a flood of blaring Technicolor green-screen films like Shark Girl and Lava Boy and the Spy-Kids films. Also there was, and still is, a social backlash against the Wachowski's because of the Matrix films. In terms of the film-making risks I mentioned above, this was unfairly dismissed. This is for fun, it's a family film, (In the best ways), and it doesn't take itself too seriously. If you're too cool for it, you're only cheating yourself. There will be more fresh, ice-cold milk at the finish line for the rest of us.",Speed Racer
231,purplestickydemon,Visually Great but a little confusing,5,18 May 2008,Ever since i saw the first trailer for speed racer i wasn't sure if i wanted to see it or hide from it i really couldn't make my mind up.after sitting down and watching I'm glad i did it is really enjoyable and the style of it is visually pleasing the wachowski's definitely scored again with an effects movie.The bad points to it was keeping the cartoon feel mixed with the live action it moved to fast and at some points you could easily loose track of what was essentially a pretty simple plot.Also the races again they moved so fast now i know thats the point of the movie but a lot of the intensity of some of the race scenes was hard to capture.It isn't a masterpiece but it is a lot of fun and it's well divided between lovers and haters but its worth checking out.,Speed Racer
232,pilgrimtom,Speed Racer . . . Childhood favorite transformed . . .,9,2 November 2016,"First things first . . . I began watching Speed Racer when I was 8, and for a kid from a family of amateur races, it was a religion for me. This film had to overcome the memories of my childhood and, to my surprise, it did.The filmmakers took every cheesy bit from the series and recreated it in the film. They created a story that would have fit right into the series. They stocked it with cartoon-like villains which were EXACTLY what the film needed. And, most importantly, the cast of the film was almost flawless.Not a huge fan of John Goodman, but he was the absolute embodiment of Pops. Susan Sarandon, Paulie Litt and Kick Gurry were perfect, and Matthew Fox was a surprise as Racer X. Christina Ricci (with the support of a wonderful Ariel Winter) . . . was . . . Trixie! Trixie was my first crush as a kid, and I was in love all over again.Sadly, the only minor flaw was Hirsch as Speed. He was good, I'd almost say very good . . . but . . . he was missing something that the other cast members provided. He somehow failed to display the emotion of the original character. Sigh.This film was made for the fans of the series. Outstanding!",Speed Racer
233,casperthegoth-1,This movie is excellent. Forget what the critics think...,10,24 May 2008,"There are two things that I can say about this movie. 1) This is the most fun I have ever had at the movies, with out a doubt. 2) This is one of the few movies that I felt was truly worth the price of admission.Some things you should know about me. First, I actually like the Star Wars prequel, sure it took some time, but once I lost my ego about the mythology, there are some really interesting movies there. Second, I dislike Bound, and hated the Matrix. That whole set seemed so faddish and derivative of Twilight Zone and Doctor Who episodes. Finally, I had no prior knowledge of what the world of Speed Racer is about, I had no notions as to what to expect.I would primarily like to take issue with the Rolling Stone review which suggests that this film is all glamor and technology, with the touch of human hands. How wrong was this thought. From the early shots of Speed trying to get through grade school, through his monumental first race chasing the ghost of lost brother, to the touching moment when Pops admits his mistakes he made with Rex and tells Speed that he is loved and welcome, all the way to the trap that Racer X has created for himself... this movie had me laughing, crying, and back again.The special effects are amazing, obviously, but what really took me by surprise was the depth of the story. The exciting race scenes are framed with themes of family values, corporate corruption, identity, self-worth, strength and vulnerability, facing the past, honesty, integrity, and destiny.Perhaps the Rolling Stone reviewer forgot to listen with all the shimmery and beautiful colors. Perhaps it's bit like chewing gum and walking for him, but I got through it feeling renewed, not only with Hollywood, but with myself. I felt like a kid again, and it was the best feeling I've had in a great while.Oh yeah, it has amazing CG effects also.",Speed Racer
234,GoodMovieGuy,Great Family Movie.....,10,21 May 2008,"I saw this movie with low expectation because I'm not the fan of the original Speed Racer. But, boy, what a movie! This movie blasted me. From the extraordinary special effects, extraordinary editing, and good casting, all of them stunned me. You can have everything in this movie. I like the style of this film, alternating between flashbacks and the main plot. The director is very creative, he can portray every character's background without losing his pace. The story in this film is also great for family. You should see it with your family, it will strengthen the bonds. I think a lot of review undermine this film. The failure at the box office is not because the film is bad. The timing of the release is not right, it should not be released with other summer movies. It should be released before. Anyway, it is a great movie. Watch at the theater, do not wait until it is released on DVD, you won't regret it.",Speed Racer

It was adapted perfectly and without many of the cartoon's flaws. The visual style and artful quality of this movie is way better than this mediocre rating.,Speed Racer
236,bpmovies,Recommeded Family Fun,9,11 May 2008,"Don't miss this movie. In a nutshell, Speed Racer is a positive message about staying true to your heart that tells you to do good over evil. It's simple, but it works. Speed ignores the money and goes for doing the right thing. Speed's parents tell him, ""How proud we are of you."" It's a wonderful positive movie message about the importance of family. Sure it's cartoonish, but of course that's exactly what style of movie they set out to make. Mission accomplished. Although I would have edited off 10-15 minutes (my wife disagreed with me), Speed Racer is a perfect cartoon-to-movie creation as I have ever seen in my life. Stunning visuals which enhance the cartoon flavor. I recommend when you watch Speed Racer to just have fun and enjoy the ride!",Speed Racer
237,jtrascap-1,Excellent rendition of anime classic,8,29 May 2010,"I really don't understand the bad reviews for this movie - it's an excellent, fun family-friendly homage to the classic cartoon, and as such it's really a marvel. I had the chance to see the original cartoon's first year recently - the jump-jacks, the World Racing League, the mountain-climbing cars, the pitch-perfect voice of Matthew Fox as Racer X...it's all there and much more. Some reviewers can't get past the physics of the movie, or that you have to be under 10 to appreciate it, or any number of narrow-minded reasons. Sure - it's not for everyone, but here's a clue: it's a CARTOON, bright and colorful, made for kids who like to play with their Hot Wheels (and everyone who can remember what kind of simple joy that was).Speed Racer is amazingly original in conceptualization and design, as beautiful to watch as The Royal Tennanbaums (for instance). It's like a designer's orgasm. The flowing transitions are perhaps some of the most kinetic editing moves since The Road Warrior. It's real and unreal at the same time (which makes it all very safe for younger viewers). It's also about not losing what makes you special on your way to growing up. It's fiercely anti-corporate and focused on the the family as the center of learning about life, not what you can get away with. Many times Speed is tempted to take the short path or be a bad sport. There are many lessons in this movie, just buried beneath the glossy surface. By the end, when the lights and animation are flying fast and free, the heart of the movie bares itself. Plus it has a monkey. More movies need a monkey these days. Some writers have been disingenuous concerning an incident of ""animal cruelty"" - one of the chimps bit an actor, and the hired handler struck the animal. You can read about it here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_Racer_(film)#Plot but you'll also appreciate this has nothing to do with the production or the intentions of the filmmakers. It's also the perfect movie if you have an axe to grind: if you're anti-big Hollywood, or computer animation, or PETA-philes, or if you're anally-attached to real-world physics, or if you want your childhood entertainment ""dark"" to match your adult views. Listen to these voices at your own peril - they're the grumblings of frustrated adults who've forgotten the thrill of playing with cars on the stairs. Speed Racer is an auteur's vision of a classic anime - it's not perfect, and sometimes it's too camp for it's own good - but it's also sweet and decent and furiously-fun entertainment that's safe for all ages. And if that's not rare and precious thing these days, I don't know what is. Go, Speed - Go!",Speed Racer
238,acerbus_8,"To follow up V for Vendetta with this, doesn't make sense",3,25 July 2009,"Visually this movie is quite its own and thats certainly a compliment. Flashy and highly saturated, which goes well with its origins being a cartoon. Unfortunately the saturated color fest stops having an impact after 15 minutes. The bombastic colors just makes the images busy and in this way they kinda kill their own uniqueness. Very interesting compared to Sin City, where ""the less is more"" approach keeps making an impact all through the movie.After this, there was little to hold my attention. Surely this was apparently made for kids. But personally I don't see why you cant write a good movie that can appeal to both kids and adults.My greatest problem with the movie was my own lack of interest in any of the characters. The story is rubbish, dialog meaningless & acting quite senseless. But I definitely thought the worst thing was that none of the people in the movie aroused anything within me. I didn't care about anyone. It might be the point that everything was exaggerated and cartoony in some aspects. But I'd think that you'd still want the audience to care about the good guys. The only feeling I had towards anyone in the movie, was to the smallest of the Racer boys, and that feeling was irritation.I wasn't expecting V for Vendetta 2, or something close to it. Every Wachowski movie cant be based on stories from a master like Allan Moore. But I expected a good movie, even if it was a movie intended for kids. I definitely didn't feel like this was a good movie, even if the brothers accomplished whatever they set out to do with this one.",Speed Racer

I was surprised by how fun it really was! To be honest, it took me a little while to adjust to the intense color and cartoonish quality of the film. But I really enjoyed these qualities. One of my favorite TV shows of all time is a cartoon, so I guess I have a different perspective than most people. I can understand why some people didn't like it though. They went in expecting a remake of the cartoon, and instead got something unique. Even though I like cartoons in general, I really didn't care for the Speed Racer cartoons. So this was actually a pleasant surprise for me.Yes there was violence and some swearing. Come on parents! Yes kids are impressionable, and yes we need to screen what they see. But was it really that bad? I would rather my son watch Speed Racer than Sponge Bob any day. My son loved it and that is what is really important to me. As a parent I was satisfied; I loved that Speed and his family stuck together and faced all odds as a united front. Go family values! I loved that they were ethical and wanted to keep their individuality instead of being greedy. Go underdog! But morality aside, it was a cool racing movie that didn't try to be pretentious or high-brow ed. It was just fun. And that is why we will definitely see it again.",Speed Racer

The plot of the film is pretty much what I remember the cartoon plots being like. The racing is that crazy battle-racing that you remember from the cartoon with the push button saw blades,tire treads,etc. There are the obligatory fight scenes which are very over the top cartoon style fights. The characters are well portrayed,Ricci has never looked better.Bottom line is that fans of the cartoon will come away with a much more appreciative view than those who either didn't like the cartoon or have never seen the cartoon. My 8 year old loved it,while I thought it was a fair movie. If you aren't a fan of Speed Racer the cartoon, wait for the video and go see Ironman instead.",Speed Racer

Just as the movie got started a family of four showed up and wouldn't shut-up. The mom wouldn't stop texting when the film got a little silent, all I could hear was *click click* and she laughed at all the stupid jokes VERY LOUDLY. and then whenever there was a heart to heart moment the son wouldn't stop talking and the mother made no effort to shut him up and the daughter wouldn't stop complaining. PEOPLE LIKE THAT ARE THE REASON I DON'T WANT CHILDREN!! that're one of the reasons I couldn't fully get into the movie.And now to the movie-I loved the movie the acting was a bit over the top at certain parts but I could get over that.-the comic-relief(spritle and the chimp) wasn't funny period. humor was attempted but fell flat.-I loved the action it was really fun to watch -Thet could have put some extra effort into the 3-D stuff -They kept the seizure inducing graphics which made me really happy I don't have epilepsy -Taejo Togokhan(played by Rain)and that one white haired Asian racer were hot (but Taejo Togokhan was not as hot as white aired Asian) Over all I really liked it I wish I could have gotten more into the movie but I couldn't",Speed Racer
244,moinsyyed,I Don't Know What Haters Were Expecting But It Did Exactly What It Set Out To Do,10,3 May 2008,"and that would be, entertain.I can't describe how many times I thought 'whoah!' it's one of those moments that could only ever happen in cartoons or 'whoa!' that was anime level crazy! This film set out to create a literal live action adaptation of a lovable & cheesy retro cartoon anime. That's exactly what it did.Let's start with the PG rating, this was appropriate not because this film is 'aimed' at kids (which it wasn't clearly, as box office disconnect showed) but because it's a 'family' film for all ages based on a cartoon that most of the older generation watched when they were kids, the source material barely even bordered a 12A and yet the film managed to in fact surpass it's source material in maturity. Fans of anime will seriously lap this up despite what the recent comments have said. Not only has every care been taken to preserve elements of the source material but it also has those cool retro and also modern anime moments. Good and bad guys with crazy cartoon anime hairstyles, crazy over-the-top kung fu, elaborate motion line effects just like in mangas, crazy death defying races, cheesy as hell dialogue which fits perfectly in context! Performances were quite impressive given it's a predominantly 'kids' PG film and that they were filming against green screen.I also commend the Wachowski's use of such a strong colour palette.They didn't tone it down or diverge from the theme and each scene had a contextual wash of colour.Serious or more intimate moments had darker shadows while remaining colourfully vibrant. They were bold and not shy about what this film was going to look like.To the haters again i say ,'what exactly where you expecting? The Matrix with cars?, people getting there throats slit?, symbolic commentary on capitalism,corruption, religion or the new world order? Go into this movie expecting high adrenaline scenes and all campy fun that only a 60's anime adaptation can provide, but don't just to go and watch it just to 'see what the fuss is about' until you actually understand what the source material was like. That way the movie will exceed your expectations.I don't have complete praise for this movie however, in that towards the end of the film they got a little overboard with the editing and i was really let down by the final antagonist type drivers. Speed seemed to have a harder time in the casa cristo race in the film where the other drivers were far more menacing. It seemed like 'Cannonball Taylor', 'Gray Ghost' and especially the bad ass, white haired yakuza driver (for musha motors by the way) were just a flash gone by and Speed just beat them without any problems at all. Let's hope they make more of a presence in any semblance of an extended/directors cut",Speed Racer
245,Jason-Kraken,Great exciting film with heart!,10,11 May 2008,"I am not sure why this is getting negative reviews, or why it's doing poorly at the box office. I know Iron man was good, but come on, there must be some more people out there.You know a lot of this generation of film goers/makers, have this attitude that everything must be darker and more realistic. Yeah, cause realism entertains us! I want to have a good time at movies and be entertained and possibly have a good story or two.I am a film maker and watcher and fan. I collect dvds and love ALL kinds of movies. B&W, Asian, Indian, and Hollywood. I love all genres too! Others of my age (25-30) don't like B&W movies cause they are ""boring"" and are all just gray color, nothing to entertain, no effects.Well this movie is fast, effects filled and colorful beyond all belief. I mean Wizard of Oz is getting a run for its money by Speed Racer. But people hate it cause it looks cheesy or whatever.Well this movie is based off an anime based on a manga. I WANT COLOR! If this movie was the dark xmen, or superman returns (with his ridiculous dark blue outfit) I wouldn't have seen it. I mean xmen could've been B&W anyway, cause there was no color.This movie had heart and excitement. I wouldn't give 10/10 unless it was the total package. The story was fun and I liked the message. I liked when speed learns of the corruption and was forced to learn about the real world, and to step out of his fantasy.The anime was brought to life on the screen. Whenever I think of superhero comic movies I like to close my eyes, imagine the show I loved and then open them. If I don't see a live action version of what I was imagining, then it sucks. Look at the upcoming GIJOE, destro has no mask???? The Joes are in black suits like xmen.And all these people love it. They love it because they are too scared to admit they love superheroes they way they are! So when these dark movies come out and they characters look ""cool"" then all of a sudden the comic geeks come out of hiding and say ""we love it!"" We love the matrix suited xmen, we love dark blue superman with burgundy cape, we love joker with his ""crow"" makeup, we love all that.Well how come the comics remain true to form and still sell every month? If no one wanted color and excitement, the comic industry would fall. Superman is still bright red and blue and sells just as well as he always did.Speed Racer was the first actual comic book movie, and of course everyone hates it, so they wont make a part 2. Oh, and Hulk was OK too, but of course everyone hated that, so now we have a brown swamp thing fighting hulk, and they call him ""abomination"" the abomination is the audience that abandoned all wonder.",Speed Racer
246,FreakinFilmFreak93,Not as good as others say it is,5,1 July 2009,"Hey, people! Was Iron Man too much of an understandable sight for sore eyes? Then have an eye-bleedingly good time with Speed Racer, because no-one cares about plots or epilepsy!Speed Racer, based on the retro anime, wasn't that bad, but wasn't that good either. There are many people who aren't real critics who say this film is fun. Sure it may be fun, but guess what had to ruin it?In a much-too-cartoonishly-colourful world where racing is a big thing and human names are just made up of words (mostly), Speed Racer is the fastest racer of all. Ever since he was a kid, Speed wanted to be a racer. When he was old enough, his dream came true. Now, well, I don't understand what the hell actually goes on in this movie. The film's length doesn't help at all. All I remember is that the Racer family goes to a factory where Speed meets someone who is one of the villains of the story, he starts racing again, he goes to Asia, he competes with Racer X, he stays in a new home, he races again, he loses to Rex, he races yet again, and you know what happens next. It's just too complicated!Here's what the pros are. The casting is good and some of the characters are likable. Spritle (another weird name) and Chim-Chim the chimpanzee, for instance. They made me laugh. The acting is okay, though sometimes cheesy (this happens with Spritle sometimes). The music by Michael Giacchino was great, as his works always are. I loved the stunts, too. The special effects are decent, but I think you all know what ruined it.And now the cons. The plot is quite misunderstandable. You wouldn't know where the hell this film was going. The colours were fit enough for an LSD trip, and look like they came out of Spy Kids 3 or Sharkboy and Lavagirl. The film is rated PG, though there's a few PG-13 jokes, such as the funny scene where Spritle gives the middle finger. Family fun! The costumes are just plain silly, for example Speed's father wears overalls in one scene that make him steal the appearance of Mario. The blue-screen effects are pretty weird. Some of the singing of the catchy movie version of the theme song could've been more appealing, too.But the biggest con of all is how insane the special effects are. There's more CGI than Son of the Mask and even more dizziness than Cloverfield. Trust me, I got pretty dizzy from watching it. I watched it online since I couldn't be bothered to rent it, but thank God I didn't see it at the cinema or the IMAX. It also could cause seizures. They even have black and white flashing lights, which could kill people that are epileptic. Some shots of the races are too long, because they just quickly zoom in to each character at times instead of just cutting to them, which is just evil. In some global cinemas, Cloverfield got a warning for the dizziness that it can cause, but why not Speed Racer? No wonder why it didn't do well in the box office. It's a good thing that the video game for this movie got a warning about seizures.Overall, Speed Racer is a pointless roller-coaster ride of a movie, and I hate rollercoasters. The best viewing experience of the film is on a screen smaller than an HD one if you want to enjoy and survive through it. If it didn't try to make me feel sick, I would've loved it more.",Speed Racer

But how do you make an Anime classic into a live action film? Well what the Wachowski brothers have done is genius. (I loved the 1st Matrix movie, thought the 2nd had moments and the 3rd one Jumped the Shark!) But Speed is definitely up there with the first ""Matrix"". This movie is so ahead of it's time, the visuals are amazing, It's Pop Art come to life! It has elements of ""Tron"", ""Clockwork Orange"" and ""Death Race 2000"" and it's still a family film. It's like Walt Disney, Andy Warhol and Kubrick decided to make a film together. I can see why people hated this film, it's like nothing they've ever seen.

From creating a flick that had changed cinema forever to the most nauseating roller coaster ride I've ever been in. If anyone of you are looking forward to see a good (passable) anime adaption, go and pop in Death Note, Oldboy or even Initial D. And I'll tell you why you should be avoiding this garbage.Have I previously mentioned the word ""nauseating""? Yea, maybe I'll enjoy this movie more if I had some aspirin on hand. Yes, utilizing a neon color palette sure is a challenge and pretty original in my book. But if two of Nicolas Winning Refyn movies, Only God Forgives & The Neon Demon, can be the polar opposite, why can't you do something similar considering you had 3 TIMES his budget?With all that aside, there are, thankfully, a few ""watchable"" moments in this entire 2 hour disaster. Speaking of run-time, it wouldn't be that long and presumably entertaining if they just completely erase the two little ""animals"" (the monkey and that kid I wanted to decapitate). Why would you cut back to these 2 when we're in a middle of a pretty intense conversation? What grotesque species are you.Guess who they can afford with all that truck-sized money. Emile Hirsch. Wow!!! You can get John Goodman, Rain ( a popular Korean star) but picked out an unknown as your main character? But the real reason I was disappointed was the fact his acting chops are as good as a 2 am infomercial host. Trust me, it's that terrible.Sorry, I don't usually express my personal hatred towards films in my reviews. But because I legitimately liked some parts from this movie such as Sir Goodman and Sir Allam's captivating performances.

251,jethered,Artistic & Refreshing,8,13 May 2008,"The recently released Speed Racer movie has proved to be one of the most accurate adaptations cartoon to film I've ever seen.The cartoon is from the late 60's and is originally Japanese and then ported over to United States where it enjoyed quite a bit of popularity. As a child of the 80's, I had seen Speed Racer in reruns and remember thinking it was a little difficult to watch just because it was felt dated. The stories seemed corny and the animation was sub-par compared to what I was used to. It wasn't until much later, when I became a student of animation, that I began to appreciate Speed Racer. In the 90's the cartoon resurfaced all over cable and grew a large cult following because of it's ""kitsch"" or ""camp"" value. It's chock-full of unintentional innuendo.The Wachowski Brothers' film adaptation translates the original cartoon almost exactly. The plot feels totally lifted from an episode; from the outlandish villains and their ridiculous schemes, to the side plot of the annoying little brother and his pet chimp. The actors all look like character designs from the cartoon. The wardrobe is exactly the same, if not very similar. There is a scene where Emilie Hirsh is wearing Speed's outfit right down to the red scarf. Even the show's signature ""suggestive gasps"" made it into the movie. The only thing that is changed is the high-tech set design, which looks like BladeRunner dipped in a LisaFrank color palette.That aspect, however, the color palette, is one that must not be ignored when talking about this film. To say that it's over-the-top is almost an understatement. Bright, vibrant colors, lights and animation dominate the movie from start to finish. This look felt most appropriate during the action scenes but in carrying it throughout the film, they really succeed in creating an entirely different world. It's stylized to the point where one might even call it experimental. Absolutely nothing about the look of this film is realistic. Ever.This is precisely what I enjoyed about Speed Racer. They took a cartoon, and made the film version as ""cartoony"" as possible without animating the entire thing. More films that take their source material from a cartoon, comic book, or video game need to take this approach. Not everything has to be applicable to real life. I believe filmmakers do a great disservice to these original works when they're modified to be ""believable.""I found Speed Racer to be visually engaging for the entire 2 hours I was there. There are times when it drags (the non-action scenes) but overall, I had a really good time. For the first time in quite a while, I felt like someone with an imagination was behind the scenes. I don't doubt that these guys painstakingly watched every single episode of that cheesy cartoon (cringe-inducing as that sounds.) I feel like it's important for the filmmaker to know his source material-- and know it well. I respect and applaud the Wachowski Brothers for taking the time to really study the original. My recommendation is that anyone who is a fan of the original series should definitely see it. Also, artists (particularly animators and illustrators) should give it a try because it's a great exercise in visual art. If you do not like the original cartoon, do not like cartoons in general, and are more a fan of realism in movies, this film is not for you.",Speed Racer

253,spicekillen-1,from looks of it not as good as it really was!!,9,11 September 2008,I almost passed on this film from the looks of it. It almost looked like a film for a kid to me. But I was so wrong. This film is entertaining even at times where it almost is childish. The rest of the movie is great! The colors in this film are Amazing! Never seen anything like it. Kind of reminds me of Matrix when it came out. The new ways of filming to give a new experience. The acting was also good all throughout the movie. Every actor plays his/her part and it adds to the experience naturally. I also liked the speed feeling in this movie!! It really felt like riding in an incredible speed and you get a rush if you watch it carefully. That was awesome!! It is truly a movie to be experienced. Watch it!,Speed Racer
254,Sheldogg23,Fun Family Film,7,13 May 2008,"As a dad to kiddos at the ages of 8 and 10, I literally had to drag myself to an industry night screening in Hollywood...even with the wife, the excited kiddos and the promise of free popcorn and sodas, I had no real interest in seeing Speed Racer. A self-proclaimed film snob who majored in film studies, as well as an auto-racing enthusiast, I was determined to dislike this movie. Maybe I'm still a little sour after Matrix Reloaded. Regardless... ...I really enjoyed Speed Racer. Visually the film was absolutely stunning - the colors, the imaginative race tracks, the cuts that were very similar to how I remembered the cartoon in my youth...it was fun to watch. And when it came to the storyline, it was much better than I thought it would be. Not a perfect piece of film by any stretch of the imagination, but a fresh way of sharing the message of ""Never give up!""Performances were stellar. Smart move for Emile Hirsch to follow up the Into the Wild explosion with this fun flic. John Goodman and Susan Sarandon offered depth to the cartoon plot, and good old Matthew Fox was a great choice for Racer X. All in all, Speed Racer was far better than I thought it would be.",Speed Racer

I've been a fan of the Wachowski Brothers ensemble of films (Matrix, Vendetta), so I figured this one deserved a chance too. I've never seen a single episode of Speed Racer, it's slightly before my time, and I've never gotten around to checking it out on Hulu. Anyway, My Fiancée and I watched it together and loved every minute of it! Due to some hectic schedules we had to split the movie in two and watch the first half one day and the second half the next day. When we sat down to finish the second half of the movie we both expressed how we'd been thinking about it all day long. During the final race my fiancée said she got goosebumps! By the end I was definitely happy that I'd taken some time out of my day to watch this film. Kids will love it, and Adults will love it, just keep in mind, this is as close to a cartoon as any live action flick has ever gotten in my opinion, so don't expect something awe inspiring and thought provoking. Now don't misunderstand what I'm saying, this movie isn't a masterpiece, but it is a lot of fun! It was filled with humor, action and emotion, something for both children and adults. I plan on watching this one again!",Speed Racer

I did not drive to the theater).The plot did not make sense... the ""un linearity"" of the plot confuses kids (not just mine, but all the kids nearby where asking their parents about how to follow the movie), the graphics made you feel like you were playing a video game from the late 90's (PS3 or XBOX 360 graphics, anyone?)

(I don't think it would be considered a spoiler to point out that he makes this sound a few times - a sound that can only be described tactfully as a sound that might be made by someone sitting on a toilet who's just taken Metemucil).. I saw it with a whole row-full of friends at the IMAX theater hoping to have a fun time and every one of us were deeply offended by it. The movie (and, consequently, I guess ""The Brothers"") doesn't even seem to mind that it's view of ""the future"" or this fantasy world it presents is so horribly ugly and mean and desperately bleak.

The colors, the racing sequences and the over all fun all worked together. You see people complaining about the CGI. Well I am not a CGI fan because its over used and often takes so much life out of an action sequence.Speed Racer utilizes it as a backdrop for a fantasy world that exists only in our imaginations. The Brothers have actually managed to bring that world to life. The CGI though dominating, is used as a background canvas and does not hinder the adventure and the thrill that you get when watching.I suspect people will come back to this movie later and realize just what a feat it is.It is just an homage to the TV series. It isn't rocket science. but what a loving homage it is.",Speed Racer
259,TheRuralJuror,A Film that Works Only About Half of the Time,5,10 May 2008,"I wish Hollywood would realize that obnoxious children are not funny. They just aren't. I don't want to pay money to be annoyed. This movie tried so hard to make the kid everyone's favorite character, but I really just wanted him to suffer. Anyway, I would say that this is a film that works about 50% of the time. It has the same weaknesses and strengths of The Matrix trilogy, in fact. The action sequences (as computer game-y as they were) made for pretty thrilling viewing when the Wachowskis weren't throwing too many talking heads around (literally, talking heads), but the rest was fairly hit or miss. There was some really BIZARRE flash back techniques they used that just made everything needlessly complicated, and one in particular involving Matthew Fox at the end was laughable. I would say pretty much every actor was severely underused, including poor Christina Ricci who barely had a point. Matthew Fox did a nice job, I would say, except in the aforementioned flash back scene. Then again, it's hard to be too good when your head is floating across the screen every 3 seconds like a ping pong ball while exposition plays out in the background. IF you go see this, I would say IMAX is the way to go . . . unless you're prone to seizures in which case I would never see this movie. The whole thing kind of looks like the inside of a pin ball machine. There's lots of colors and sounds, and you're not sure what's going on, but it sure is fun to see.Now, if you're going to ogle some man flesh, the Wachowski's apparently have you in mind because the guys look great in this. Emile Hirsch walks around with Danny Zuko hair the whole time looking like jail bait. There's one scene in which he walks into the kitchen after just waking up with his hair all messy in a white t-shirt that was almost worth the price of admission. Matthew Fox and Rain get to show off their chests a few times and parade around in leather suits and artfully ripped shirts, respectively. Oh . . . and I don't believe Kick Gurry ever wore sleeves.",Speed Racer

After reading the critics ratings, I didn't have high hopes for the movie and mainly bought it since I wanted to learn about some of the special effects on the bonus features. All I have to say about this movie is: WOW! It would be impossible to do a better job translating an animated TV series into a movie. They knocked this one out of the park. I was a casual fan of the series as a kid, so I am not one of those die hard fans who are either easy to please or impossible to please. Where to start? They perfectly captured all the elements of the series and managed to place it in one movie. This is a better translation to film then ""The Dark Knight"" was. That's saying a lot. Whoever cast this movie should get an Oscar. This was the best cast movie ever! All the actors hit their characters dead on. The special effects were just as impressive as when you saw ""The Matrix"" for the first time as well. Perfect is the word that best sums up ""Speed Racer"". I'm not one to give out many 10 stars, but this one definitely deserves it. All the critics who didn't give this movie a great score need to find new jobs.

It's stylized, great CGI, fast paced (like a video game, so it really holds especially young boys attention), great story line, good acting, and it has a funny monkey. Love it. Our boys, 8 and 4 still love this show and we don't even own it in blue ray; which I'm sure is an even more amazing watch. My husband and I enjoy watching it too. I just can't understand why it wasn't more popular in the box office. As to the length, well let's be realistic, if kids can sit around for more than 2 hours playing video games (which I know they can because we live in a neighborhood that is predominant in video gamers), then they can sit through this movie. My kids can sit through it and as a family we aren't into watching a lot of T.V. or playing video games. I think that maybe people just need to be a little more open minded and just sit back and enjoy it for it's pure entertainment value. Isn't that what movies are for?",Speed Racer
262,WillJohn68,Amazing!,10,1 June 2008,"I don't understand why this movie has been getting such bad reviews. ""Speed Racer"" is a wonderfully colorful, evenly paced movie based on a poorly drawn and badly animated cartoon. Granted it's a very entertaining cartoon, one that rightfully gained a place as a pop icon. But for its own reasons, it's pretty awful in its production values. The Wachowski brothers have taken something that many of my generation grew up with and remember with fondness, and turned it into something that tickles the eyes, ears and heart. From the very start it's obvious that the film is paying homage to the original source while at the same time leaving its own original mark. There are enough references to the television cartoon to remind the viewer of the movie's origins, yet the Wachowskis adeptly take the style of the t.v. series into a new medium. This is something which rarely happens, as in Peter Jackson's ""King Kong"", or the Coen Brothers' ""The Big Lebowski"", a very smart and well disguised take on ""The Maltese Falcon"". So many failed attempts have been made at recreating a story and its characters in a different medium (Robert Altman's ""Popeye"", Mark Dippé's ""Spawn"", or, for that matter, ""Young Frankenstein"" on Broadway), that if anyone mentions making a movie based on a cartoon, a television show, a comic book hero, or an older movie, the result is a roll of the eyes or an online torrent of posts telling Hollywood to leave the classics alone. But if a classic is carefully and creatively handled, and molded into something like ""Speed Racer"", then we're in for a fun ride. The streaking colors in the action scenes are turned from the flat scratchy backgrounds of the cartoon into vibrant and 3-Dimensional splashes of hypnotically frenzied fireworks, with none of the headaches I'd heard they cause. And on the characters and sets, the hues work wonderfully, a la ""Dick Tracy"", without sickening the stomach, a la ""Sin City"". The story of the film only goes a touch deeper than that of the cartoon series, which simply preached that cheaters never win and that it's always swell to help others. The movie version offers a slightly more real take on the challenges of growing up, taking responsibility for one's actions, and standing by your convictions. While the minor baddies are just as bizarre as their cartoon counterparts, the main characters, good and bad, are a lot more real than could ever be attempted for the television show. And wherever the original would have pasted in some out of place witticism at the wrong time, ""Speed Racer"", the movie, tucks in some very bright, funny and often tongue-in-cheek moments. This isn't a brilliant oratory on humankind and its place in the universe. It isn't a deep statement concerning the problems of the world. It's a slick, flashy, fun Hot Wheels track ride, with just enough pit stops to take a breather. Go Speed! Go!",Speed Racer

I thought, during the movie, particularly when they broke out the KUng Fu, that the screen writer must have decided that the producer was nuts and that he would give the producer the most ridiculously bad script that he could in the hopes that they would fire him; or, that it would turn into a cult bad classic.",Speed Racer
268,gabby_bm,"good, bad and UGLY",3,19 June 2009,"For old-school Speed Racer fans, this is not your Speed Racer. This is definitely next-generation Speed with the visuals, high-speed, flashing, strobing effects that would give anyone over 20 years old an epileptic seizure. For me, that is my only complaint- that the racing scenes were too difficult to watch. Too much bright neon, edits too cacophonous eliciting a strobing effect that gave me a headache. It made me feel like I was in the cockpit of one of their cars, driving through an endless sequence of neon signs.But once you get past that, you get a good flick. The casting was excellent. I can't say too much more about that. Trixie, Pops, Spridle, Speed and even Racer X were cast effectively and with their particular look and talents in mind. John Goodman looked healthier than he has in a long time. The storyline was effective and current with dialogue that wasn't too condescending or volatile, though I wish they would have focused a bit more on the Racer X backstory.The heart of the movie was visually appealing but frankly, the only disappointments for me were the racing scenes. The cars were all moving in a ""Tokyo Drift"" with no semblance of control, the races were all performed at night which flooded every race scene with overly bright neonesque visuals, and we never got to really see the star of the show, meaning the ""Mach 5"". There was a lot of emphasis on the jumping ability of the car (which all the cars seemed to have the capability of doing), but not much else.I rate this film at three stars (* * *) one for the casting, one for the story and one for the dialogue. I deduct stars for making it visually unappealing in the race scenes and for neglecting a major target audience- those who grew up with the original and who don't spend a major part of their life hooked into an X-Box.",Speed Racer

Visually, i cannot even explain how mind blowing it is. Not even 300 hundred beats this movie visually. The plot, not something revolutionary but it stays faithful to the cartoon. So, go ready to see things you've never seen, like every time you see wachowski written somewhere in the movie credits.

To cut it short, it is a bubble gum film. the main objective of the film was to be children's film and i think it has achieved it. The age range for this movie is 7-8 yrs and now if you think what the movie was actually, you will like it. The actual parameters of making the film actually shows and thus it is not a bad film. The directors, said that they wanted to make a film which their two nieces can go and watch, so when i take it in that sense, I think, it is a very well achieved film, and truly satisfies its parameters. Now as for me, i didn't like it because it just wasn't my type of film. The visual treatment of the film is just startling. Really good effects but it has those bubble gum colors.... so it didn't touch me so much. The movement of the story is good, but it does not grasp so much.

The movie was surprisingly good. I have to admit that it was everything I would expect for a live-action Speed Racer movie. I know why few people would say that it's stupid, but they're only noticing the little flaws in the movie, which weren't really flaws if you ask me. Some of the scenes, like the random jokes and suppose-to-be funny ones were awkward and really weird. But overall I think this was a really good movie. The action scenes were sweet, the plot was well done, the characters were exactly what they're suppose to be, and the actors were really great. I like Matthew Fox's portrayal as Racer X. He made that character so true to the one from show, it was just great seeing him play the role. And I also like to mention Emile Hirsch really convinces me that he's Speed Racer from the beginning to the end. John Goodman, Christina Ricci, and Susan Sarandon were great in their roles too.

I was blown away.,9,22 September 2008,"Every once in a while, a movie comes along that blows away my expectations, drags me in, then tosses me about like a ragdoll until the totally predictable ending leaves me in just that intended state of mind. For me, this was one of ""those"" movies.If you are into some good old fashioned 'little guy vs. big business' theme, or just like a mix of CGI and live action that is almost too much input to process, then Speed Racer is for you. In a nutshell, the plot revolves around corporate oligarchy and what has evolved into a worldwide obsession - fantastical jet powered cars that race on a gravity defying track while performing defensive and attack manoeuvers, destroying each others' cars in amazing explosions. Don't expect reality in Speed Racer. It isn't about that. It forces a suspension of disbelief to make it even plausible (and I daresay enjoyable). It makes you enter into an alternate universe. If you don't get into the head space of the movie, then be prepared to yawn as you constantly criticize the impossibility of it all, from beginning to end.I've heard some people say that the movie was hard to follow and that the directors tried to make it too much like a comic book. Well, it is like a comic book and, if you aren't ""into"" a movie, *any* movie is hard to follow. I can barely get through ""Gone With The Wind,"" and I've never been able to get more than 30 minutes into ""Camelot."" Why - 'cus they bore the heck out of me. Naturally, because I think that they blow, I spend a lot of time making fun of them. I'm sure that some people out there have the dialogues of those two memorized...Speed Racer takes some of the camp of old-school kung-fu/eastern movies and weaves it into a technological universe bathed in a comic. It is an intelligently done movie that requires a good attention span and desire to be immersed and entertained. Hopefully, you haven't been made action movie cynical by repeated viewings of John Woo movies...so you can enjoy what will become a cult classic.

The CGI plays a major role in this film, but doesn't look impressive in the end.

The worst part is the race does not create any interest (though I'm a F1 fan). I bet you that the race never makes you to sit at the corner of the seat.None of the scene in this film creates an interest and keeps the audience entertained.

Besides the self evident beauty of the images akin to pinball machines on steroids, the like of which we've never seen, the story is a rich mix of very touching drama and very funny, zany comedy. The main actors provide very real touching moments and bring emotional reality to the film, while some of the supporting actors play wonderful broad characters that might have been lifted from an Edward G. Robinson film. The script is very well crafted, mature but still good for children with some very important messages. In a country of increasing conglomeration, I think the plot of a ""Mom"" and ""Pop"" family business trying to survive against the Uber Corporation is timely and compelling.In short, the directors took kitsch, stayed true to its original ideas, but seamlessly crafted in a more mature and real point of view",Speed Racer
280,rsud,Perrrfectly Speed Racer...,8,10 May 2008,"The movie is no masterpiece but catches the essence of Speed Racer. Turn off your higher brain functions (if you have them!) and enjoy. Story has enough depth for its genera, actors do a nice job. I was pleasantly satisfied.I see all the negative reviews and wonder, what a bunch of farts. They just don't get it. Hats off to the wachowsky (or whatever) brothers. Nicely done, sets a nice tone. I actually thought it could use a bit more action. I would have liked to see scenes with longer focus on the mach 5 and it zooms around the track.Other movies like this are spy kids which everyone loved.",Speed Racer
281,DrNevada,"Fun, Different, and Cool",9,1 March 2009,"I am a Wachowski brothers fan, I love The Matrix, and I even think the sequels are pretty good and though yes they are not as good as the first but there better then most say. I think here they made a fun movie. Yes its a movie that seems only geared toward kids, and not really accessible to most parents but I still liked it. I think the cast is great, everyone here feels like a cartoon character in a good way. The visuals are breathtaking, maybe head-ache inducing for some, but I loved the visuals. Now the big flaw of the movie, its story telling. There are points where the movie drags. It runs over 2 hours, which I think will annoy some kids. There is about 15 minutes worth of fat they could have cut. There were literally sequences where I say to myself ""why didn't they cut that, did they need that"". There is a sequence of Spirtle causing trouble during Royalton and Speed's meeting and it was just really annoying and it took me out of the scene. There is this sequence where they racing in the desert and it kept cutting to other racers being bribed, why did they need that? I mean all the other racers were already established as being dirty so why did they need that? I think there were too many flashbacks of Speed and Trixi as kids, I think one scene was enough of them as kids together. There is also just a simple scene where Speed is about to kiss Trixi and Spirtle interrupts it. So there is a lot of parts of the movie that dragged and could have been cut. I also wouldn't have mined more scenes with Speed and Trixi (present time), I didn't think there was enough. So while I know I went on a rant, but I actually did like the movie. I wish more people would have liked it, and I wish it did better in theaters. Its not a situation where I am going to bash people by saying they don't get it, I can understand why people hate the movie. I think the movie will pick up a big following on DVD, and will probably be a cult classic. I hope that happens and then we can get a GREAT DVD because the one Warners released sucked. I love The Matrix DVD's features, but there is nothing here and I know they documented a lot. So its a fun movie, and I recommend giving it a chance. Also it helps if you have a giant flat screen and you watch it on Blu-Ray.",Speed Racer

283,jaesonk-1,A real treat for fans of the original!,10,10 May 2008,"We just saw the movie today and ... WOW! They did a fantastic job translating the original to a live action movie. The attention to detail may be lost on those not intimately familiar with the original series. It might be worthwhile to re-watch the original cartoon to fully appreciate what they achieved with this movie. Was it really 2 hours 15 minutes? It certainly didn't feel like a long movie, a good sign to be sure. It's worth every frame. From the starting line to the checkered flag, Speed Racer is action packed, funny, entertaining and a real treat for fans of the original. Two big grease covered thumbs up! Go Speed Racer Go!",Speed Racer
284,max314,MUST SEE! A Masterpiece of Visual Cinema,10,28 May 2008,"I went to an afternoon matinée showing to fit around my schedule, and while there were only a few people there, we were all laughing along and people were cheering and whooping. And I left the cinema with a grin the size of a crescent moon plastered on my face. The Brothers seem to have delivered a real crowd-pleasing extravaganza of a film.The racing scenes were bleeding spectacular. I mean ""spectacular"" in a way that has never even been imagined. Honestly, it deserves an Oscar nod just for art design. What's so ingenious about the opening sequence is that it not only sets up all the characters with entertaining and emotional efficiency, but it also establishes how the cars work in this fantasy world. So despite the races being faster than anything you're ever likely to see, the main action beats are always delivered with a clarity and a style that will keep you thrilled beyond belief. Each race is perfectly crafted with the stakes and the challenges rising further and further with each successive scene...until we reach a final showdown that leaves you utterly breathless. Literally. And the ""visual vocabulary"" of the film is truly innovative. It's like the camera is no object. As an audience member, you've never felt freer. Unlike the stylistic approach of the recent 'Star Wars' prequels, which generally used locked off cameras and relatively tame tracking shots, 'Speed Racer' ducks into, under and around the action in a way that opens up the medium like no other film before it. Compared to other film in its greenscreen sub-genre, this leaves movies like 'Sin City' and '300' looking rather timid by comparison.But at the heart of it, this is really a film about fathers and their sons. A coming of age story about hope, expectation, and the pain of loss. I found myself with a lump in my throat while watching the movie. Wait, let me rephrase. I found myself with a lump in my throat within ten minutes of the film starting. Emile Hirsch, John Goodman, Susan Sarandon, Matthew Fox and Scott Porter as the young Rex Racer all provide intimate and genuinely moving performances. Make no mistake about it, this film is the definition of joviality on celluloid. But the story is basically driven by the shadow of a lost family member from the very first scene in the film, and that's what really makes the film worth watching. As well as being immersed in a fantasy world of drop dead gorgeous visuals, of course.In the same way that 'Sin City' was an exaggerated, impressionistic noir, and just as '300' was an exaggerated, impressionistic war movie, 'Speed Racer' plays as an exaggerated, impressionistic 1960s kid's show. Which is exactly what it is. It's campy. It's fun, And it's full of humour and heart. Of course, brooding characters and over-the-top gore is easier to sell than camp, colourful fun, but allowing oneself to become absorbed in the film's style makes for a rewarding experience. I've heard complaints about the film's exposition, but the only scene where I could perhaps understand that criticism was about half way through when Taejo's family troubles were being told. But even that zipped by very quickly and the audience still understands exactly what was at stake in the upcoming race. So if it is a flaw, it's a minor one at best.The characters are warm and lovable, the villains are wonderfully hissable, the actors' performances are all suitably camp, and the morality tale at the center of it - the battle of family versus corporatism - gives the story a real spirit. And makes the races all that more enthralling to watch. It's infectiously charming, and even at 129 minutes the film glides like a T-180 on ice. I was convinced I was only in there for about thirty minutes, and when it finished I was left gagging for more.So what's the verdict? Well, it's a tricky decision between 4 and 5 stars. While the story wasn't exactly the peak of literary greatness, it was very well told. Despite its two hour plus running time, the narrative was sharp, the emotionality was touching, and the plot turns were genuinely exciting. If the film was not such a special effects extravaganza, it would probably have been given a 4 star rating. But the film DOES have incredible special effects. And it DOES offer an absolutely sublime spectacle. Not only that, but the Wachowskis seem to have yet again set another industry standard - one that will likely be copied and mimicked for years to come. Until the Brothers reinvent the wheel for a fourth time, that is. And as such, the rating for this film is for something that could easily end up becoming highly influential classic.Bring on 'Speed Racer 2'!",Speed Racer
285,buddascrayon,A good fun movie,8,2 February 2011,"I don't understand the people who hated this movie so much. It has a lot of character and a really cute storyline that follows the same parameters of the original anime. Right down to the slightly cheesy graphics, it gives you a real sense of those old cartoons. Which were very low rent in and of themselves. But they were made back in the 50's with a wholly different value set from today. I enjoy myself every time I watch this movie and take it for what it is. And I am looking forward to getting a bluray copy so I can enjoy it in 1080p.If you are one of those pretentious Rotten Tomatoes types who compares every movie to Citizen Kane, then by all means skip this one. But if you are a classic movie fan and want to have a really good time, then rent this and you won't be disappointed. It has a lot of classic action, a slightly suspenseful storyline, and a really fantastic cast.",Speed Racer
286,fear_da_fro_bro,The entire movie lacks real energy and especially lacks heart,1,21 March 2014,"Speed Racer pretends to be live action anime art but ultimately there was no thought put into the effects and there certainly was no thought put in to the writing. The action scenes are weak simply because they scream cartoon. The entire movie lacks real energy and especially lacks heart. Not only that, but there was zero chemistry between the stars and seem to intentionally deliver no personality or charisma. I didn't exactly expect character development but I did expect to care about something in the film. The closest they come is a mind numbing flashback between Speed and his father (John Goodman) recalling a family tragedy but it is poorly handled. (John Goodman beating up a few bad guys was the only bonus for me) This movie does have some wild cartoony effects that quickly became boring as their setup and overuse flowed for far too long. The absolute cheesiest special effects and the absolute worst kids movie that any parent could try and sit through.",Speed Racer
287,actionromancefan,The most spectacular vision I have ever seen,10,11 May 2008,"First of all, keep in mind that this is a story based on a cartoon. If it got too deep, it would stray away from its original source material. This movie was a ridiculous amount of fun, and I even did get attached to the plot at some points. I was a fan of the original cartoon, and the Wachowskis managed to make this movie amazing.It was all a beautiful technicolor dream, and I was blown away by every second of it. The colors, the motion, every detail was so perfect and so precise. It was over two hours that just swept by me and I haven't seen anything this good since....... hmmm..... there's no comparison. You know how Xanadu manages to have a horrible plot but it's trippy and interesting and it managed to stay a cult classic? Xanadu has nothing on the colors of this movie. The motion and everything, it was like Sin City. Except with way more than just three colors. The plot to this movie was pleasant and enjoyable, and stayed true to the original cartoon.In fact, in some parts this movie was like the Matrix. Every little fight scene had some Matrix elements to it, the same precision, my mind was blown in the exact same ways. This movie was just perfect. My seven year old little sister who usually gets bored during movies, especially ""boy"" movies, had her eyes glued to the screen the entire time. The jokes managed to make everyone in my family laugh. My mother cried at one point because she thought this movie was so moving. This movie literally has something for everyone, and even if it doesn't, it's certainly the best eye candy that has ever existed.",Speed Racer
288,Hole_In_The_Bucket,"I liked it, but wasn't wild about it.",6,14 May 2008,"Before someone tries to tear me a new one, I have to say that the Wachowski Brothers did a good job with this film. They really have a strong mindset to incorporate high production values. BUT they are starting to remind me a little too much of the current George Lucas mindset. Make it all digital and flashy and they'll come! While the plot was different from usual fare, it really didn't hold my attention, nor did it hold the attention of the supposed target demographic of the kids in the audience of the theater that I attended. I had to move several times because of the distraction of kids crying, whining about being bored, bouncing up in down in seats, and just generally running all over the theater because what was on the screen was not holding their attention.After about 20 minutes into the film, I found a nice, quiet corner to try and focus my attention on the film and hopefully enjoy it. And I did, to a point. There were some definite nods to anime, most notably the fight sequences. I also did have the pleasure of watching a digitally projected version of the film and the colors really popped off the screen.While I understand the style of CGI was meant to be more cartoonish, it was a little distracting for me. Reminded me too much of how it was used in the ""Spy Kids"" series (another 'made for kids' set of films I sort of liked).The acting was okay. As okay as one can be when mouthing two-dimensional dialogue with very little character development. Not a whole lot of invention or wit put into the words. John Goodman really made the most of what little he was given and I could stare into Christina Ricci's eyes all day and be happy. :) Again, it wasn't a bad film. I'm sure the video game won't be much different from what was up on screen. It'll probably translate better to the next-gen consoles anyhow.",Speed Racer
289,deadpanwalking-1,Actually quite good.,9,19 May 2008,"I'm not sure why this film gets bashed so much, it's waaay better than I expected after hearing such a load of vitriol from amateur and professional critics alike. The race scene's aren't actually hard to follow and the back-and-forth flashbacks during the races were, I thought, a very clever way to show exposition rather than just having various characters rattle-on about what motivation this or that character might have. I think what we've got here is a movie that's not playing well in theaters but will have quite an extended life on-demand and through DVD sales, playing a lot on cable, etc. Sad that it's not getting the box office expected but welcome to the world of cult classics.",Speed Racer
290,eperez-7,See this one on the Big Screen!,7,29 May 2008,"If you are so inclined in the least to see this movie, your viewing experience will be best if you see this one while it is still in theaters. Seeing this on the big screen you will truly appreciate the great attention to detail this movie offers. You'll be glad you did.If you look past the negative criticism, behind the action scenes and comedy, you will find the story of a family's love for one another as they struggle against the forces of the many villains they encounter on and off the race track.Rated PG, see it with the kids, but prepare for the mild language, etc. you'd expect to find on the wilder side of television.",Speed Racer
291,kstanley,Loved it!,9,19 August 2009,"I'm a Speed Racer fan from way back; I watched the show as a girl in the 70s, and Speed was my first childish boyfriend. I don't know what my expectations were for the movie, but I was prepared to be disappointed with someone else's interpretation of my childhood classic. However this film is fabulous. I've watched it fifteen or twenty times at this point, and it appeals to me on every level--the excitement, the fx, the themes, the music--all of it. That final Monte Cristo race is my favorite bit, and it really demonstrates how good of filmmakers the Wachowskis are. And I think the movie holds up; I've gently arm twisted family and friends to watch it, and they too enjoy the drama and well-crafted joy of Speed Racer--the perfect balance of kitch, seriousness, fx, and philosophy.",Speed Racer
292,ponbrony,Favorite movie of all time,10,16 August 2019,"This is my favorite movie of all time and I will explain why. The story is great not the best I will admit, but this movie has by far the best visuals I have ever seen. See what I find the most interesting about it in my opinion, is that they make a live action movie look like a cartoon and they made it work! Yes there are alot of cheesy moments in this movie, but that's the point! Its supposed to resemble a cartoon. So yes this is a number one in my book, fight me!",Speed Racer
293,sxeclown,This Movie Was EPIC!,8,10 May 2008,"Above everything else, this movie is a visual feast that stays true to the cartoon. I think it is really unfortunate that so many critics are complaining about the visuals in this movie, because I think that they are truly fantastic. I can safely say that I have never seen another movie like this one, and I feel that so many movies are going to try to do what this movie did. A lot of the visuals really are beautiful bursts of color similar to what you find on the busy streets of Tokyo, and this movie is aware of that. It is like they took Shibuya and made it a hundred times as big and colorful. Only someone who has been to Tokyo will know exactly what the Wachowskis were going for in this film. After all, it is based on a Japanese TV show.The acting is somewhat campy, but can also turn that gear into more serious acting. It can be funny, and then be heartwarming. Lots of the racing sequences are very over the top, but the movie knows it and does it well. The tracks are very creative, and I can only imagine how fun they were to design. If real racing was this exciting, I would watch it all the time. I can understand why this film made the race tracks so crazy, because who would really want to see two hours of regular race tracks with cars going around and around? The sound was also really impressive in this film. The sounds of the race cars were explosive and loud and if you see this movie in a good theater, it will make it that much better. The music is also very fitting and tasteful. Probably the only time I will hear ""Freebird"" without being annoyed.Also the politics in this movie were excellent as well. I feel above all the message of this movie is that money corrupts art. This movie portrays Speed as more of an artist than a race car driver. A big corporation wants to sponsor Speed, but Speed knows that corporations are evil and are only looking to make more money. He is very dedicated to his craft, and does not want to sell out. Speed knows that corporations corrupt art, and so does this movie. You will not see one piece of product placement in this whole film.So overall this movie is very self-aware. It wants to entertain, and it does exactly that. It wants to be different, and it does exactly that. Don't listen to those wimpy critics that didn't like this film because it gave them a headache. Many people said the same thing about Moulin Rogue, and that movie is fantastic too. Critics who complained about there being too much color should have brought a pacifier with them to the movies, because only babies would complain about how this film looks. Race to your theater to see it now.",Speed Racer
294,tataglia,A cult classic,8,23 May 2008,"I was prepared for the worst - after the Matrix sequels and the reviews, I fully intended to give this one a pass, but my 8 year old daughter wanted to see it, so Speed Racer in IMAX it was. I'm so glad we went. She LOVED it, and so did I. The best cartoon-into-live-action movie ever made, I think. It put me in mind first of Tron, for its visual audacity, and of Altman's brilliant Popeye, the only other film to successfully bring a cartoon character to life, IMO. John Goodman was particularly noteworthy - he was the living embodiment of the anime dad, an amazing feat from a guy with some pedigree in trying to pull off the cartoon character thing.I feel certain that this film will be revered and imitated in the coming years in ways that the latest Indy film and even Iron Man - excellent though that was - will not. It's an interesting landmark.",Speed Racer

I watched the movie with an open mind, and have lowered my expectations since it's the Wachowski brothers and it's a cartoon. Taking digital bits' editor Bill Hunt's words with a pinch of salt, I thought I would be at least entertained for those two hours. I was gravely wrong...The movie was extremely tedious. Despite the digital eye candy (I'm sure Bill Hunt will rush out to get the Blu-Ray version of it) and loud wall to wall, balls to the wall surround sound, I nearly fell asleep. Yes, I nearly fell asleep during those race sequences! The plot is threadbare, as expected, but the dialouge is beyond redemption and tedium. Exposition is painfully conveyed to us and the melodramatic scenes are puke inducing. Unsurprisingly, this movie rated extremely high among the 7-11 age groups, according to IMDb news.I would not really recommend this movi...I mean eye candy to anyone, unless your surname is Tarantino or Hunt.",Speed Racer
297,ingloriousbasterds,First Place Winner,9,4 May 2008,"I must admit that I know, or knew rather, very little about the story or history of Speed Racer- and his TV series - and maybe that is why I enjoyed this movie so much. Although, this is still a different type of situation where one who was a big fan of the shows might be seriously critical of every little detail of the turned movie. I don't believe anyone who considers themselves truly knowledgeable about Tatsuo Yoshida's work can say that this was not represented well on the big screen. I'm now intrigued to go back and check out some episodes of Speed Racer.That aside, as far as it being a movie and a work of art, I would give this movie high marks in both categories. For it being a movie, it was nice to see something so different as far as the approach to making it go. Also, having such an incredible cast makes it all the more intriguing. I don't see anyone else having portrayed any of these characters any better than the cast that was hired to do so.On an artistic level, it is extremely hard to think of any other movie that comes close to being in the same league. I did not see The Matrix, but I would say that anyone who liked Sin City for its cinematography and graphic elements, would love Speed Racer. The use of bright photography that's added behind a green screen makes for a far more dramatic effect. Take the artistic elements of this movie, and put it together with the amazing cast (both looks and talent) and throw it together with a very different but coherent plot, and you've got yourself an extremely enjoyable movie that is definitely worth seeing. And seeing at the theater no less! My hats off to The Wachowski Brothers, and the rest of the cast and crew for putting together something different for a change.GO...",Speed Racer
298,rafaelgherardi,Colorful wonderful movie!,10,21 May 2008,"The Wachowski brothers rule! They're simply great about creating different movies and worlds. They always create things we've never seen before in our life. And I think that's very, very nice.I didn't know why critics didn't like this movie. It's everything so nice. I really can't see what they found bad in this Wachowski brothers' masterpiece.The script is really, really nice. It explores almost everything which is necessary: family love and relationship, difficult decisions and comic scenes with two funny characters. It's a really hard to understand plot, but when I watch it for the second time, I'll surely understand it. Beyond the plot it has the huge performances of all the actors in it, Christina Ricci is so lovely and cute as Trixie. The soundtrack is also nice, but I wanted it to have more on the original anime theme. But even that way, Giacchino's work was very beautiful and the races songs are very cool. The effects are wonderful, mainly in the races. The races are simply wonderful, stunning and amazing. I just found it hard to find where the cars were, but I think the DVD experience will be much better, and which of course I'll surely buy it.I loved the way they presented the movie. The camera movements, the huge variety of colors and mainly the races. I just really didn't like the differences between the real sets and the CG sets. It was kind of strange and surreal. But it really doesn't matter. Speed Racer is still perfect even with this little defect.This is certainly one of the best movies of all time and surely, one of the best of the year.

This movie is fantastically different on so many levels.First the directors chose to make the colors of the movie really saturated on purpose to give it a cartoon feeling.Second, I don't know if anyone noticed but they made just about everything on screen in focus, which I'm pretty sure is the first movie to do that. Go back and watch it and the background, the person closest to the camera, and the person in between is all in focus. Then go watch a different movie and you will see the blur you get.

Best of all, it is family-friendly of all Wachowski brothers films.But I cannot give this a likeness to Bullitt.

But this movie helps you remember what movies are supposed to be about. It's doesn't have to be about an amazing story or something that changes your life. A movie just needs to take you on a journey, and this movie definitely did. If you liked the wacky style of Charlie and the Chocolate factory you will definitely love this movie. I don't usually walk out of a movie and think ""wow"" but I did with this one. My bro who was a huge speed racer fan growing up also thought it was great. If you watched the show you will love it.

302,duane-93,"Where are all these good reviews coming from, who are these people who like this?",3,26 May 2008,"Point 1: Coming home from 1st grade in 1973 and watching Speed Racer, Ultraman and Johnny Socko and his Flying Robot is one my most cherished childhood memories. The whole imagery, the music and the style lodged dreamlike feelings, mysterious aura and even a slightly haunting (I don't mean scary) impact into me as a child. For kids my age at that time, this was the first (and only for the time) intro to those big, overdrawn eyes from Japan, and there was just something...weirdly enticing about it. (I'll admit that Trixie was my first childhood crush...probably explains why I'm so screwed up today).Point 2: When released on DVD several years ago, I started to watch them again, 30 years later, and I'll admit, I was like....ummmmm...maybe I should have just left it alone. Just killed another cherished childhood memory, dude. BUT, watching them, even though I had to admit as an adult that the stories, dialog and animation sucked, watching them 30 years later STILL invoked those dreamlike sensations and mysterious aura, and I was glad for that.I cannot fathom how ANYONE, who either saw Speed Racer at age six in 1973 or never saw it, or saw at age 6 in 2003 even in the context of modernized entertainment, can like this movie. Like the original Speed Racer, it lacks decent dialog, a decent story, and believable action. But it commits the cardinal sin of making its action completely incomprehensible. Yes, the original Speed had preposterous physics, with cars going straight up mountains, sideways along cliffs, and bad animation with nothing more rotating backdrops behind a static Mach 5 with spinning wheels. But even a 6-year-old like me knew what was going on! You know that a filmmaker is either lazy or don't know what they're doing when each shot averages about .3 nanoseconds in length. Did someone get crazy with the editing scissors or they just didn't know how to construct good, coherent action. I never once felt involved in the action sequences, much less could follow them.Some have complained that this movie is too bright, uses too many colors, and should have an epileptic seizure warning, but that was the least of my beefs. Yes, I did jokingly say after it was over, ""Too many colors...I need aspirin"", but it wouldn't have been so bad if I could follow what the hell was actually going on.The BIGGEST SIN of this movie?????.....They KILLED the Theme Music!!!! Where was it???? That was the best part of the original Speed Racer Cartoon!!!! ARGGGGG!!!!!!

303,sebastiansawko,A fabulous cinematic experience! An orgasmic roller coaster ride!,9,30 October 2008,"Wow, just wow! This film is like a big, sweet, richly garnished, multi-tiered cake. It feels so fresh, bouncing and visually stunning. It's beautifully filmed in vivid flamboyant colors. Each frame offers the viewer rich candy-like sweetness, which is by no means nauseating and fits the plot and the mood of the film perfectly. It's been made with wild unfettered imagination, heartfelt enthusiasm and meticulous attention to detail. This abundance of detail is especially appreciated on repeated viewings.Plot-wise it's basically a film for older kids or teenage comic book fans, however, in my opinion, adults will also appreciate it. There is a lot of slapstick humor to be found, and the flick requires a tongue-in-cheek approach if you want to fully appreciate its over-the-top charm. The characters and sets are cartoonish, but in a good inspiring sense and the general feel of the movie is that of a fast-moving action-oriented comic book on screen. The editing is flawless and flowing. The pace is fast and you will never get a chance to feel bored, though you may find yourself a little overwhelmed by the amount of eye candy and the panache with which the action scenes are done. The camera work, frame angles and editing are all innovative and very artistic.To sum up, this film is a breath of fresh air in film-making. It's ferociously imaginative and blindingly colorful, loaded with breathtaking racing sequences and extremely pleasant to the eye. Don't listen to the ever-grumbling professional critics; if you are young at heart and thirsty for a lush cinematic adventure give this small masterpiece a chance! PS: The movie is NOT another Matrix! It's visual genius, but has a totally different style and tone from the Trilogy.",Speed Racer
304,imig88,"20% movie, 100% speed racer",8,12 May 2008,"I went to see Speed Racer with my 6 year old. Speed Racer was a big part of my life as a kid; I watched Speed Racer when I was 6 and wanted my own Mach 5. What little boy didn't? I wanted my son to share the same feeling.First, the movie is visually stunning and in a world all it's own. The colors, style, cars and racing are all true to form from the original cartoon. I was constantly glued to the screen just to experience the universe that was created..just for fun. I could swear they even messed up perspective a couple times just like in the cartoon use to do! The length of the movie didn't seem that long. Really, the brief moments of story between the races and action were short enough that my 6 year old didn't even have time to fidget. In fact, I wanted more: More races, more Mach 5, more scenery, more more more! Nothing from my memories of Speed Racer were ruined or altered. I think that is what people really wanted to see. Not a ""Godfather"" in the Mach 5, but pure Speed Racer. What the movie lacks in deep plot, fully developed characters or even following the laws of physics in any way, it more then makes up in the most important thing of all: It is 100% Speed Racer.",Speed Racer
305,samppapa,total waste,1,3 September 2009,"I just wonder what went on in those minds who made the Matrix. This is a cotton candy in acid. This is not a movie. This is a special effects show and poor one too. Story suits for four year old and acting by some very good actors is dull. I guess if you get your kicks from cheap Japanese comics and crappy anime this feels like Gone With a Wind, but if you have seen more than two movies it should be clear: this is not even a movie. As a commercial trick it works, some comments here prove that, but as a movie, I just don't see how this piece of poor nonsense and psychedelic colors in speed could be even called a movie. Watching this is as much fun as being sea sick.",Speed Racer
306,tatcat-1,Loved it!!!,9,30 September 2008,"I just saw this on PPV, and would have loved to have seen it in the theater! I'm not a big fan of cartoons, but I do like computer-aided, special FX movies. ""Speed"" did not let me down. Loved the blend of real people in a cartoon setting with the eye-popping colors! Great work and I expected nothing less from the Wachowski bros.!!! Let's see a sequel, even if it has to be in video only. And... I gave it a 9 because it tended to be a touch slow in parts. The storyline was good and easy to follow. I used to watch SR as a kid, but never paid much attention to the plot. John Goodman was excellent, as well as Susan Sarandon. I will go out and buy this movie for my DVD library.",Speed Racer
307,dcandido,better than I expected,8,18 May 2008,"I took my son to see this on Saturday. When I saw the running time I was filled with dread and I brought the Ipod in case of boredom. Well, I'm happy to report that the Ipod stayed off for the entire film.Considering the source - a cheaply made cartoon from the 60's that was intended for 8 year old boys - this was an entertaining movie with a very cool ""look"". The acting was reasonably good and Christina Ricci was a beautiful mix of innocent/sexy! BTW, I'm not really a fan of the Wachowski brothers - I liked the original Matrix, but thought the sequels stunk. Have not seen V yet - guess I need to get out more!",Speed Racer
308,champ1964,Speed Racer 2008 IMAX - I can't wipe the smile from my face!,10,11 May 2008,"What can I say, Speed Racer has been my hero since I was 4 years old. I really didn't expect this movie to meet my Expectations. I was WRONG! Too, reviewing the cast left me wondering how their performances would harm or help the overall feel of the film. I have to tell you, This movie is a gift of wonder to any Speed Racer Fan. I haven't had a smile this big on my face from a movie in years. The overall feel of the film is totally unique and GREAT. The use of color, with a mix of Real Life and animation was a total rush. Clean cut as only Speed would do it. The film reflects to honesty, Honor, and great family values for all ages. If you Love the Original Speed Racer cartoon series, You will not be disappointed. Whacky comedy with all your favorite characters are all represented. The action of the film keeps you on the edge of your seat. Only a few moments of close family reflection give you a break to set back and take a breather. The use of flashbacks are edited to perfection. We saw the movie with a mixed group of ages ranging from 8 to 48, The kids were blown away, even with no prior Speed Racer history. See it in IMAX if possible, YOU WILL LOVE IT!Champ",Speed Racer
309,Nevermore1001,Go Speed Racer Go,10,27 May 2008,"Personally, I think Speed Racer is one of the better movies I've seen in a long time. And I work in a movie store, taking five home every week. So I've seen a lot.Speed Racer has outstanding special effects, and I think the Wachowski's and their team did an excellent job. The plot was surprisingly deep for a kids movie (and I hate calling it a kids movie, because to me it's a good film for anyone). There was a lot of emotion, and every time I see that final race, I get cold chills up my spine.I highly recommend seeing this movie. I was deeply saddened by the fact that it bombed opening weekend, which probably ruined the chances of me seeing more from the Speed Racer universe. I think that this is my favorite movie out of the summer releases so far. Yes, I loved Iron Man, and Prince Caspian, and Indiana Jones IV, and I'll see them all once more before they leave the theater, Speed Racer is the only movie since Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl that I've seen more than once (three times, actually) and want to go again. Hope you all enjoy it. (I saw Pirates 8 times in theaters.)",Speed Racer
310,Catrob15,Wow..just WOW,10,9 May 2008,"I went into the movie expecting the worst. I came out bouncing around like a little kid at Christmas, squealing for joy at the shiny gifts Santa has left for me. The Brothers knew how to deliver this movie, and they DELIVERED. The casting was fantastic, the characters felt like the characters from the Anime. And bless the Brothers for using an actual chimp and not some CGI thing. The movie just popped right off of the screen. It really made you feel like a little kid again...plopped down on the floor in front of the t.v watching your favorite Saturday morning anime. Man oh man, my breath has been taken away. Fans of Speed Racer shouldn't be afraid to go see the movie. You will not be disappointed at all. Wow...just wow. I don't know what more to say, I'm still in awe at how well the movie actually was.",Speed Racer
311,macari,Car-Fu is probably the lamest catch phrase coined by Joel Silver,1,4 May 2008,"Joel Silver is on the biggest losing streak of churning out the worst Hollywood has to offer. Does he even care about pleasing the public anymore or is he so out of touch with reality that he thinks these types of movies work? Speed Racer is a hollow shell of a movie with no real story to tell of and the visuals cannot compensate for that. Sure, the special effects are different but after a while it becomes monotonous. This movie would have been better served had it been about an hour shorter because how much do we really care about the politics of big business has over racing in the fantasy world of Speed Racer? The kids certainly won't care and that is who this movie is targeted towards.",Speed Racer
312,rob-983,This failed miserably,1,17 September 2008,"I was born in 1964. I used to watch Speed Racer as a kid in the late 60's and early 70's. This film is supposed to be a live action version of the cartoon. Why didn't the film maker create an authentic live action version. This is some kind of hybrid of cartoon and live action. This film isn't even as good as the cartoon. The cartoon had better stories, dialog, and acting ahahahah and its a cartoon. The speed racer cartoon had some tension to it some excitement. This thing is bore. The races are so unrealistic that they are hard to watch. Cars bounce around like pinball's. You never feel for the characters when they are in danger because its such a joke. The CG towns and sky look really bad. I cant find anything good to say about this movie. I was looking on the computer and using it as background noise most of the duration.",Speed Racer

314,katlaurief,sleeper classic that went unappreciated,10,5 May 2019,"I can see why at the time of its release this movie would be unpopular. It's a lot of very cartoony looking cgi, has a weirdly abstract story structure, and is achingly genuine in its narrative and characters. But in retrospect I think those are all things that make it a fun and unique movie. At the time people thought the cgi and over saturated colors were bad, but looking back on it I think it just wasn't the right era for the hyper colorful, stimulating fun which is this film. If you're on the fence I would recommend watching just the first race. The wachowskis manage to pack so much into a 15 minutes sequence that really sets up the characters and pace of the movie in a fun and rewarding way.",Speed Racer
315,divydademon,Love Proving Myself Wrong!,9,9 May 2008,"This was hands down a Super Awesome Movie. When i saw the Teaser Trailer i disregarded it as the end of Emile Hirsch's Career as we know it. Then i saw the Theatrical Trailer and it forced me to give this movie a chance and low and behold i prove myself completely wrong...i Cant wait for the DVD i will be the first to buy it. Speed Racer is a must see for everyone...and i mean EVERYONE. There is stuff to keep kids teens and adults alike entertained throughout. Unbelievably, all the actors perfectly pulled of the anime like dialogue perfectly. It was pleasantly cheesy but not over the top w/ the cheesy and then the serious and dramatic parts were enough to make my eyes burn a little. Matthew Fox was the big surprise in this movie because i didn't know if his days as a serious actor were gone because of this but NO he was brilliant along with everyone else. GO SPEED RACER GO!",Speed Racer
316,ppodruch,Incredible Pace,10,27 June 2019,"Not perfect, not normal, but a work of art. This movie exemplifies the values of family, morality, honesty, and throws in some of the most incredible visual effects I've ever seen. Nothing is normal in this movie. People are driving through the streets in Bugatti's, and and octopus spaceship launches in the background. The movie could do without some very childish humor, but if you'll allow yourself to be immersed in the cartoonish world of Speed Racer, you'll enjoy this two hour film very much, and probably watch it again. The characters are easy to get behind, with an immersive plot to overthrow a cartel and bring fixed racing to an end. This movie is full of heart, and the final climax which lasts nearly a half hour is out of this world. Its an unapologetic work of art.",Speed Racer
317,clumsychild,Anime to Live Action,10,9 May 2008,"I have to admit that when I saw that Speed Racer was being made into a live action movie I was completely skeptical. I remember the original anime being cheesy and campy, but at the same time I enjoyed it. It was one of the reasons I got into anime in the first place, the other being Dragon Ball. So when I got into the theater this evening I had no idea what I was in for. However the Wachowski brothers clearly, in their love for anime themselves, have done a terrific job making the transition.The use of color is brilliant, the story line sticks to everything that happened in the anime, cinematography is phenomenal. This what I expected and a thousand times more. A tremendous job making something I thought was never possible into one of the best action movies I've ever seen.Anyone that doesn't know what they are in for, and has never seen the anime, will probably not enjoy themselves, but for anyone who is a genuine fan, you will have an absurd amount of fun with this film.",Speed Racer
318,thekallieshow,The previews do not do this movie justice!!!!!,10,9 May 2008,"SPEED RACER was an amazing cinematic experience. It was visually enthralling for the entire length of the movie, and I was entertained throughout. I'm 19 years old, and how much I loved it shows that it is not a movie just for kids. This movie was advertised SO poorly, and it makes me sad to know that this movie probably won't make a lot of money and probably won't stay in the theaters too long... but really, go see it while you can. There were, of course, parts where it was ridiculously cheesy, but done in a way that properly emulates the 60s anime cartoon that it is remaking. I agree with the critics that it is very different than the original Speed Racer, but I think that the directors properly modernized it for todays audiences and to fit with the extensive amount of computer animation used in the film. It is a visual phenomenon, an exciting and rewarding story, and a film that left me happy and shouting its praise to everyone who would listen.",Speed Racer
319,fguerilu,Great movie PERIOD in spite of poor reviews from critics,10,5 January 2011,"First off, the critics did a major injustice to this movie for giving it poor reviews. The critics are really working themselves out of job if they continue writing poor reviews for good movies. The critics robbed everyone of a movie sequel because this movie certainly deserved one.Great movie PERIOD.I can't say enough good things about this movie that hasn't already been said. It wasn't a perfect movie because it had its plot holes, inconsistencies and flaws like every movie. But overall it was great.I think part of the problem is this movie is based on anime. America+Anime+Hollywood usually aren't a big money hit mainly because most Americans are just unfamiliar with anime in general. Adding poor reviews into the equation results in movie that didn't (or couldn't) break even.Rent it, order it on demand if available or just buy movie.Ignore the critic reviews and just enjoy, you won't be disappointed.",Speed Racer
320,the_wanderer_84,Go (for) Speed Racer Go!,8,10 May 2008,"Now,now! What is it with people all over the world?! Since when did people start listening to what critics have to say?! Listen up people, critics are people who watch a movie expecting cinematic history every time!I can bet half of them even don't know what is the theme of a movie(such as this) based on a cartoon show! Blasphemous! Now, as far as Speed Racer is concerned- boy was I blown away by the visual effects! More than the action, it was the color usage; as if a painter had all the time in his world to use all the colors and create something spectacular! Yes that's what is Speed Racer made of and if this wasn't enough, the action,the speed,the overlapping of frames makes it all the more interesting! I know a lot of people must have gone to the theaters expecting another Matrix from the Wachowski brothers but isn't that unfair? Matrix and SR are two different themes. One was philosophical and the other is based on an anime! But yeah, you can certainly expect a few slow-mo sequences in the movie, and mind well they are too cool(especially in the trailer truck)! Alright I won't divulge much now. I swear. The Wachowskis have stuck to the cartoon. Yeah, they have shown a futuristic world in the movie and that might not go well with the fans(hardcore ones) but hey, wasn't 300 too jazzed up?! Kudos to the Wachowskis, they deserve a clap for this effort!All the actors have done a neat job, if not the best. But Paulie Litt,who plays Spritle, was an absolute delight to watch! For a 12 year old,he has done a pretty good job. The chimp was funny too but nothing new about it; every chimp is at it's chimp-y best!! Susan and John look absolutely adorable together. Matthew Fox, was well, OK(glad that he wasn't a pain in the neck like his character in LOST). Yeah, true indeed that the characters didn't get time to evolve much, but wasn't the cartoon about cars?? Who cares about the characters, its the cars baby! And the cars are pretty cool!All in all the movie was entertaining. 9 to the brothers for direction, 7 for story, 8 for the cast, 10 for the visuals, 10 for the cars, 8 for the action. Again I request you, please do not expect a Matrix, expect speed and you will be blown away. Must I say, you will race away! Buckle your seat belts people, its time to pay for the fuel and hit on the pedal! This movie will go well in the history of super sfx movies!!!

321,ruipprod,from heaven to hell - the worst movie ever?,1,12 May 2008,"I went to watch this movie for one reason, the directors of matrix made it.well, i just have to say what were they thinking?? the best word to describe this movie is ridiculous for the second time in my life i went to a movie and laughed not because it was funny but because it was so bad the first was when a friend gave me free tickets to the epic ""the grinch"" which is in the same ridiculous lines the movie is so long and useless that me and my gf could sleep several times wake up and not loose a thing at some point i heard someone else scream this is ridiculous, never seen that before lol people walk out of the room, i applauded the absolute reason why a person would not ridicule this movie is that they were cartoons fans, but then again that is not about the movie is it? after doing a movie like the matrix they make this trash, hope they come to their senses but i will be careful before going to another of their movies from heaven to hell..",Speed Racer
322,gto23,A thrill ride...,7,24 September 2008,"Yes it was a bit long but it was a visual treat! However I feel they dropped the ball plot wise... Having ALL the cars have the ability to do fancy jumps and other stunts was a bit off-putting. In the original show the Mach 5 had this ability and the other cars were merely cars. This made the Mach 5 SPECIAL.Also all the features on the Mach 5 were inventions of Pops Racer. In the film Royalton wants Speed and would give Pops a job but had they made Pops the master engineer that he was in the cartoon Royalton's motivations might have been more clear. As it was he really didn't need Speed or Pops.And another thing where the film was a bit of a disappointment. To us fan-boys who were kids when the cartoon ran back in the 70's, Speed racer drives a white car with a red roundel with a FIVE in it. The MACH SIX? Speed drove other cars in the cartoon and they all pretty much had FIVES on them, even his BOAT.Those who skipped the film because the reviews were bad...Shame on you! I never let a reviewer keep me from a film that interests me.",Speed Racer
323,asianalexl,Very different!,10,5 September 2008,"Okay finally watched it! Didn't know if i wanted to watch it or not because of bad ratings and how weird the trailer was.Over all an enjoyable family movie! definitely had some scenes that made your eyes attached to the screen. The movie started off in the beginning quick and kept that speed to the very end. There was some scenes that they really didn't need i thought. The fat kid and the monkey made the movie really cheesy and stale at several points. But the directing and casting was really, really good. The movie had a really artistic look to it which movies in the past 4 years have been lacking in my opinion. Every scene was always different and the flash back sequences were really smooth! Watch it because i think everyone would be surprise of what they're first reaction towards the movie was.",Speed Racer

The reason is very simple; this movie would really click with Speed Racer (or, the original, Mach GoGoGo) fans. But the movie should do well with the non-speed racer fans too. It is well directed, funny and the racing sequences are fast and actually hard to keep up with but incredibly fun.The cast looks exactly like the original anime/manga renders, even the movie is exactly matched up to the show (except racer X was a better racer than speed and well they never did show Racer X go all out) The movie follows a very anime-like pattern and the clichéd money-grabbing-corrupted villains who think money is power and all that; but that's the charm of it.",Speed Racer

It was thrillingly entertaining and hit everything it was going for, I don't think the critics understood that. It wasn't the BEST movie ever, but I don't think it ever could have been or ever expected itself to be. It was fantastic for what it was. The cast is perfect and they do a damn good job, I usually don't like Emile Hirsh, but even he was awesome. Its just fun, what else would someone expect from it? The colors were kind of TOO bright at times, but you got over it and appreciated all the insane shots that they were able to pull off. The colors actually added to the movie's feel.

326,mistaphill,"Who is this movie for, exactly?",3,14 May 2008,"I knew going in that the visuals were going to be the main draw to this movie, and after sitting through it I'm not entirely sure who the film is geared towards. Kids? OK, they'll like the video game-like car chases and the colors and especially the monkey, but they SURE AS HELL are not going to want to sit through the inane and sleep inducing dialog that is all over this movie, I could barely stand it myself. They will have never heard of the old Japanese cartoon this was based from. They're not going to want to hear how corrupt the racing industry is, or about the Racer family history, or want to see the sappy romantic scenes they want action. And you know what, they're right. Is this for adults? Hmm, they say the word ""ass"" a few times, there's some martial arts fights sprinkled in, the filmmakers assume that some of us have heard of the old cartoon, though this movie really has nothing to do with it aside from the character names and the theme music at the end, and I guess we should be impressed by all the flashy computer graphics. But man, was this thing a chore to sit through. It throws all these driving sequences at us right at the get in it's attempt to introduce Speed Racer to us, but I got a freakin headache from it. Then it got really slow and talky and I was damn near asleep. I was real close to walking out of a free screening, but I made myself sit through it. At this point, I didn't care about the characters, got bored with the driving shots, and was looking at my watch. There were points were even the visuals were very low-res looking as if it was rushed. I know some of you Matrix nerds will automatically give this a high score because it's the Wachowski's, but so what? This is not a good movie. An expensive one, yes. A sometimes impressive looking one, yes? An entertaining one? No.",Speed Racer

Speed Racer is the closest thing (so far) to represent the awe inspiring visuals, over the top melodrama and hyper kinetic motion of Anime in a live action format.Kids, grown ups, everyone, go to Speed Racer, shut your mouth, open your eyes and sink into the magical world the Wachowski's have painted for you.Fans of the show, fans of cinema will not be disappointed, it has something for everyone. And don't let the two hour plus run time fool you, it breezes by like 90 minutes. I went in a theater packed with kids and parents and not a single person left to use the bathroom, THAT'S CAPTIVATION! I'll say the same thing I said after V for Vendetta, the Wachowski's may have screwed up the last two Matrix flicks, but with V and Speed they have reconfirmed my somewhat wavering faith in the film industry, ten fold.Go Speed Racer, Go Speed Racer, Go Speed Racer GO!!!!!!!",Speed Racer

The dialog was dreadful, and the visual effects left me with a bad case of vertigo. The cast was so-so, but lacked the chemistry I expected.The ending could be spotted from the first few moments of the movie. There really was no surprise or ""wow"" moment. I guess the only thing that even remotely entertained me was Spritle's comment just before Speed's and Trixie's kiss after the Grand Prix.All in all, this movie was as transparent as a sheet of glass. Not worth the number 2 spot it's earned in the country.",Speed Racer
329,kpfrangers,99/100 Details were correct.....,10,12 May 2008,"I watched this film with my parents and younger brother on Mother's Day. Both of my parents were huge childhood fans of the original series and introduced me to it at a young age. Speed Racer stayed 99.9% true to the original series. The casting choices are most definitely top shelf. John Goodman was spot-on in his portrayal of Pops and even resembles him physically with some of the mannerisms from the show. Christina Ricci was very good as Trixie and Paulie Litt, as unknown as he may be, was the perfect Spritle. A very pleasant, yet unexpected, turn from Susan Sarandon brought some dramatic acting skills to the mainly action-driven storyline. Matthew Fox as Racer X was a great choice as well. If you have seen the show, you could have closed you eyes when he was speaking and you would have thought the original was on instead of the film. And finally, to Emile Hirsch as Speed. With the obvious physical likeness, he was an excellent choice. The only mistake that was made was actually noticed by my mom right away. Somehow, while paying so much meticulous detail to every aspect of the show, the forgot to have Emile wear blue contact lenses. If that's the only mistake made, then I'm okay with that!!",Speed Racer
330,HolyMythos,Speed Racer is racing his way to the garbage bin,3,7 May 2008,"As much as every TV-to-Movie conversion, Speed Racer was a failure.Starting off with the good (which doesn't last long), the movie follows the old cartoon pretty well; Speed Racer is ready to race his way to win. Everything you've seen in the cartoon is well portrayed in the movie, such as the vast cast of random characters and bright colors. Almost the entire movie has a green-screen background, and the colors in the movie are breath-taking.Now with the bad. The PG rating seems a little iffy, considering the movie contains gun scenes, tiny outfits and even middle fingers. The story seems quite simple on the outside, but I found myself asking others what kept happening. The story moves too fast, and jumps between sub-plots that horribly reconnect at the end. The fast motion of the plot leaves almost no room for build-up for suspense, scenes will hardly ever last for more than a few minutes.With the brightly rendered backgrounds and the fact this is a racing movie, the cameras will move fast, as expected. However, a little too fast. The camera is always moving, even long monologues leave the camera spinning around the person talking over and over. The racing scenes moved so fast that I started to get motion sickness, however you do get used to it pretty quickly.All in all, this movie qualifies as a great family movie, but thats it. It's two and a half hour runtime will keep viewers moaning for the ending, leaving only the serious Speed Racer fans amused the entire way through.",Speed Racer
331,mcjohnnyb,Pleasant surprise,8,11 May 2008,"The reviews had me wary. The running time furthered my hesitation. But, my nine year old son was persistent and I was fond of the cartoon when I was a kid, so off to the theater we trudged, dragging my wife begrudgingly along.Two hours and fifteen minutes later, we were all very happy we'd gone. Yes, it is cartoonish and campy. But, solid acting and great story telling won the day. The race action fast and furious and the characters were wonderfully played.It was an extremely entertaining and fast-moving family-friendly movie that I highly recommend to anyone with kids.I could not get enough Chim Chim.

332,thebookbroker-1,"If you are under 12 or Liked Sky Captain, you might like this.",2,19 May 2008,"If you liked that 'Sky Captain' movie that polluted the screens a few years back then this review is not for you. You will probably love this movie.As an adult movie this was pathetic. Weak story line, weak writing, weak acting. I can't believe Susan Sarandon was in this...Defenders of this outrageously expensive 'B' movie like to claim that it was for kids. Well... I love kids movies. My kids and I see most of them at the theaters. We have stacks of them that we watch over and over. Monster's Inc... Brilliant, The Incredibles, equally brilliant, Over the Hedge, Ice Age 2 (not 1), Madagascar, Open Season... all of them wonderful... but this? What about originality, you ask. This is bold and original, you say. I gotta tell you that The Spongebob movie was definitely bold and original and vastly more entertaining than this.After The Matrix, I was the Wachowski brothers biggest fan. I made all my friends and family watch it, sometimes repeatedly. That love affair continued through the other Matrix movies (yea including #2) and I was thrilled to extend it to V for Vandetta, with unforgettable performances and brilliant writing. I thought they could do no wrong. I thought they had the Midas touch. I was dreadfully wrong.One of the most, if not the most, important elements of movies like these or any fictional writing for that matter, is for the writer/director to make the audience suspend his or her belief and be caught up in the movie. At this point the theater disappears and you are transported into another world. Conversely the worst thing they can do is burst that bubble of suspended belief by screaming ""Hey this is a movie... look at the cheesy sets, look at the actors who can't get into their characters because everything is done on blue-screen... Just look at all of the stuff that couldn't possibly happen!"" Even at the emotional parts you don't care because the characters are so cardboard you haven't developed any emotional ties with them. My wife (whom I talked into going to this movie) turned to me during what was supposed to be a heart-rending part and jokingly said, ""Are you crying?"" I said ""Yes, but not for the reasons you think"".I'm sorry for writing such a scathing review, but as far as I'm concerned, after seeing that movie last night the Wachowski brothers owe me Twenty Bucks.",Speed Racer
333,vbest07,A Treat For All.,9,9 May 2008,"Well I must say this is the second weekend in a row that I saw a movie with my husband that I thought would only entertain him. Boy was I wrong! The movie kept a good pace and filled the viewers who had never seen the show into all the details. The fact that the story revolves around a family, makes this a very family-friendly movie. I have only seen one maybe two episodes of the old show and was never impressed. Yet, the movie blew me away. I think that can be attributed to the continual motion of the story. The fast paced animations and screen effects also gave the movie an added perk. So this lady's take on the movie: Go! Take a date. Take your family. You may want to leave older family members at home if they are bothered by lots of bright, fast moving lights. I know my family members over 70 won't see it until it comes to video for that reason.",Speed Racer
334,EmilyLuvsHoney,Cool Beans,8,12 May 2008,"Speed Racer is a surprise. I came in with hearing so much bad things about it, that I was ready for the crap to spill. But, it actually had a blast. Speed Racer was very interesting, the story seemed to be a little made up as it went but I still found it good enough to keep you paying attention. The big thing here is the visuals. It's amazing to look it, hell, even the opening company logos are a sight to behold. The race scenes never caught with the peril ""Is he going to make it?"" but it had some very creative action sequences. The kids in my theater where all worked up and jumping out of there seats, I kinda was too. Ever fight scene with Pops Racer made me yell ""Bite his ear!"", I hope you caught that. The performances are well suited to each character and the major complaint I had is that it didn't develop the characters very well. Speed Racer is action packed thrill ride with ultra cute man, Emile Hirsch and the always charming, John Goodman. It isn't all that great, but it's much better then I though it'd be. A great family film with keen visuals.",Speed Racer
335,tiberio_90,Exceeded Expectations!,10,21 May 2008,"I must say that I didn't want to watch this film, because the t.v. series was quite boring, also, because the trailer wasn't interesting at all. However, after watching it, I can just eat my words, not only because of the awesome effects, but also for the extremely good plot. It's very strange to find a movie that puts together an exciting and interesting storyboard, crazy, wild, fantastic special effects and great actors. Believe me, this film is full of surprises, funny stuff (which is hilarious throughout the entire movie) and, of course, high speed cars. Well, in conclusion, I highly recommend you to watch Speed Racer, since it's a movie for kids to adults, that will make you, I'm sure, to want to take your car and drive at top speed!",Speed Racer
336,coolest_hawk2004,A great enjoyable Ride,8,8 May 2008,"Well, I don't know y so many ppl are not liking this movie. I personally felt that the movie was very good. It was very well treated. The director-duo used an entirely new treatment to present a cartoon story.. Really marvelous how the cartoon evolved into real life people. Real life fantasy at its best. The movie, though bit kiddish and draggy in the start, picks up in second half and takes the audience into this entirely new world of Racing. As they promised, the movie is all about racing and racing, and hence it was good. All the races were done differently and had their own share of thrills and fun.. A complete family entertainer and a must-watch-one from my side. Go and have the speedy fun yourselves!!!",Speed Racer
337,Paynemanor,Who are these people?,9,8 May 2008,"I can't help noticing that EVERY single extremely negative review for this film (so far) was posted well before it came out! One can only assume that there is a group of people that get their jollies by trying to shoot down every new movie that comes out before they even see it...Or there are some folks out there that really should not be attending early previews because they are far too jaded to be given a voice when it comes to movie reviews.As someone who grew up with the knowledge that Speed Racer was by far the greatest cartoon on TV at the time (I mean come on, what else was there, an endless stream of pathetic Hanna Barbera schlock?), I can honestly say that viewing the old show on DVD as an adult was a different experience indeed. The dialog is silly, and the character names!...But for it's time, the animation was way beyond what they were doing for television here in the states. And ultimately, it had some good messages for kids as far as doing the right thing in moments of crisis and striving to be the best at what you choose to do in life. Oh course there was the sweet car too...But that's just it... Speed Racer was a kid's cartoon. This movie is simply trying to update show's concept for today's child. To expect anything else strikes me as incredibly foolish. And to dismiss the film as pointless visual fluff before you have even seen it...well I just feel bad for anyone who is that bitter. This is the same crowd that dismissed the first Star Wars as ""childish"" while the rest of us were having the time of our life.Go see this movie (or don't) with the rather obvious knowledge that it is called ""Speed Racer"". How serious could it possibly be? I mean, there's a monkey in it for crying out loud!",Speed Racer

340,alexkeating88,"Life in the fast lane... ehhhh, not so fast",4,12 May 2008,"The Wachowski's cartoon to big screen live action speed fest falls short on story, character development, and overall entertainment. Taking the 1960's cartoon icon, which was barely watched by most people and turning it into a live action film was probably not the greatest ideas every thought of, but neither was making sequels to The Matrix.Speed Racer is ham-fisted, poorly done tongue in cheek humor, big action film. The material would have worked better in a Disney kiddie flick.This is one film that should be black flagged from the circuit immediately, then dismantled and penalized for wasting the viewers time.",Speed Racer
341,zakkaryvanderwerf,Good movie,9,26 May 2008,"I thought this was a great movie and want them to make a sequel. I especially like how Rex faked his own death and you don't find out until the end. I also think that Rex should have told at least his family about that. If you like movies that contain a lot of special effects and automobile racing to the extreme, this movie is for you. It was also a a lot more violent than expected. There is a lot of hate and explosions and some foul language. There is also some shooting and faked death. I would honestly say that this movie is for pre-teens and early teenagers. Half of the movie is set in the future but with retro hair and clothe styles. Please take your pre-teens/teenagers to see this movie. Do NOT go to this movie at imax with elderly persons. It gave a guy in my area a ceasure(if thats how you spell it)",Speed Racer

Might be, I have no idea.However I found the movie incredibly boring and I fell asleep at numerous times. Since I wanted to see it I had to rewind after waking up of course, but I prefer not to fall asleep due to boredom.The movie is visually quite impressive with lively colors and nice settings, but the story is predictable and slow.The actors pulled through good enough. John Goodman is always performing even though he's not the greatest actor alive, Susan Sarandon steps up to the bat and the rest fill their spots nicely but not much more.What really could have saved this movie was the action sequences during the actual racing, but it felt nothing but bland and flat. It just doesn't communicate enough feeling and never catches your attention. I really expected more from the Matrix-brothers.",Speed Racer

At the end he thanked me for forcing him to see it because it was one of the best movies he had seen in a while.The visual effects in this movie were crazy, i was on the edge of my seat throughout the whole time. every race was more exciting then the last. and the fight scene with the ninja, sorry i mean ""non""-ja, was awesome. I would have to say my favorite thing about this movie is the fact that i am able to share the brothers genius with my little sister who is still a little young to be watching there other movies.

Its a futuristic waste of time and money. I don't care how many sequels they make, if any. I wont be going to see them. I am asked to rate this movie a 1 to 10. Under protest I have to rate it a 1 since it didn't allow me to rate it a 0, a big goose egg. I don't like berating someone's movie but this was a huge childhood cartoon for me and I looked forward to seeing it and I was GREATLY disappointed in Hollywood.

345,ronnijean,Most exciting movie I've seen in awhile!,9,4 May 2008,"My husband and I went to a screening yesterday. I honestly didn't think I was going to be super impressed or anything, and it'd just be a cute movie - but I was really blown away by it!! It's rated PG and appropriate for all ages. As a warning though, it's has really fast cuts and lots of colorful visuals, especially during the racing scenes, so little kids, like 4 and under (not to mention a few adults not used to the fast-pace) might be a little overwhelmed at first.One of the things that I liked best about this film was that it was very innocent and stuck to its morals. It's one of those movies that you'd feel good taking your kids too, knowing that it's actually going to reinforce values instead of questioning them. However, it never got too serious and had the perfect amount of zany comedy. It was campy and fun.I see a LOT of movies and typically get bored halfway through, feeling like it's the same thing over and over. But I had such a good time during Speed Racer! Sure I knew how the ending would turn out, but I ENJOYED getting to the ending. I was never bored, and very visually stimulated. There's a good balance between jokes for kids and jokes for adults, and the adult jokes never bordered on inappropriate (as some recent kid movies have), so that you wouldn't be able to explain to the kids why you laughed at a certain part.All in all, this is a great film for kids, this is a great film for adults, this is a great film for teens! The only people I would not recommend this film to would be those who don't think they can handle very fast-paced cutting, but it's not any worse than the majority of video games nowadays, so if you can handle those, you'll LOVE Speed Racer!!",Speed Racer
346,dreambig7,great kid movie; fun for adults without being stupid and embarrassing,8,31 May 2008,"The special effects are great; John Goodman and Susan Sarandon are fabulous cartoons. I love that this movie was not archly ironic with hidden messages for the adults and sanitized blandness for the kids. It's sincere without calculated, multi-demographic humor where they are trying to appeaI to all possible people and turn the flick into the safest, most boring commodity possible. I love that the villain is an evil rich guy and that the family's values are posed in opposition to his. I love the racing scenes which are cool and exciting. I watched it on IMAX and maybe that made it more enjoyable, but compared to the bland crap that passes for kids' movies these days, my friends and I thought it was GREAT! Trixie hangs with the boys and is an ace driver when she needs to be. RAIN is beautiful and cool! He outdanced Stephen Colbert!",Speed Racer

348,achilles26,So hokey its comical.....but I like it,6,23 December 2008,"This has to be the second movie I've seen that the critics murdered that ended up being good for what it was. Just like any other comic/TV show/ adaptation, its not going to please the masses at times or the purists but like I heard for years now just watch the movie for what it is and enjoy the show.Too bad Andy and Larry didn't get the payoff for the money they spent on this movie but after watching it I really don't think it could have been portrayed that differently from what I saw. I think they were going for as close to the TV show/anime feel then anything else.The movie was more comedy than action and Spritle had me rolling at times. Kudos to that kid for stealing the scenes he was in. Visually stimulating at times made it grow on me. Im definitely have to buy it when I see it.",Speed Racer
349,bs-30,Don't listen to the critics,8,19 May 2008,"Besides Mass Hypnosis I can't for the life of me explain why so many folks are against this movie. I took my 2 boys to see it with some trepidation - after all it has received pretty unanimous pans from all over. So imagine my surprise when I find not just my kids enjoying it but all 3 of us hooting and hollering at the screen. This is a terrific family film, it has a very positive messages, and the sights and sounds make it a roller coaster ride. That doesn't mean sensory overload - there are plenty of soft, quiet scenes that are vital for moving the plot forward.What the W. Brothers have done here is come up with a new language to tell a story. One that is visual and clever. The first part of the movie uses this language to both show us Speed's current predicament as well as go back in his past and see why he is where he is. It's seamless and exciting and the W brothers pull it off quite well. Likewise there's a particular 15 second section where Speed, Trixie, and Rex are talking to each other while the action is going on around them and the camera zooms and flits back and forth between them so smoothly and quickly that it really impressed me with how easy they conveyed the conversation.And one last thing! It doesn't matter if you never saw the original Speed Racer, the movie stands on its own quite well.",Speed Racer

The whole time I kept thinking 'I have to own this on blu-ray.' It is enjoyable from beginning to end. The movie is just fun, plain and simple. It's like tying your tie around your head, sneaking up on someone and attacking them like a ninja fun. Or taking that windy road way too fast at three in the morning with the girls screaming and the windows down fun. It's the type of fun that spurred the word 'awesome'.Seriously, this movie is the awesome...",Speed Racer
351,noah_chick,A shot of adrenaline.,8,6 October 2014,"Listen up Michael Bay, this is how you translate a cartoon to film! Speed Racer was a huge jolt to my expectations, at first glance it looks like a shittier version of Spy Kids and Shark Boy and Lava Girl. But you would only do yourself a disservice by passing this film up. The first thing you'll noticed about Speed Racer is its cartoonish and unique art style that perfectly complements the overall tone and feel of the film. And the script, while it being set back at times for being too cheesy for a cheese factory compliments the actors and pays respect to the original show quite well. In its 135 minute runtime it never gets stale in the slightest, there's always a beautiful background to be mesmerized by, it truly feels like injecting adrenaline straight into the heart. And while the delivery of some of the lines were a little jarring at times, most of the acting fit perfectly with the rest of the film. Overall it's an unimaginably fun and creative film that anyone could find enjoyment in, I'd highly recommend this film to kids and parents alike.",Speed Racer
352,granado_jake,Loyal To Anime- Great Flick,9,9 May 2008,"I have been a Speed Racer fan since i was old enough to comprehend what was going on in the shows. Staying up past my bedtime, unknown to my parents, great memories of this show. So i was going into this movie very skeptical after seeing a few of the trailers. Arriving and watching this movie i immediately noticed the COLORS!!! This movie is very colorful and from the previews i was not sure if it would work. After the first race i knew that they made the right choice. In terms of acting and casting of the characters, i felt it was perfect. They all played their roles damn close to the anime counter-parts and it felt right (Not having the long, fast run-on sentences thank god). The story was pretty accurate and faithful with a few minor changes, which i felt was overall for the better. The only complaint with the story i had was with the installation of the gadgets (mainly the defense ones, saws, cockpit cover) was not the same as in the anime and i did not feel that Pops did not get the recognition of what he deserved. Other than that no problems with the story. The cinematography of the film took a second to get used to. The transitions between scenes was CRAZY at first and then as you got used to them they got better and made the overall racing action spectacular. Speaking of the racing it was done very well and the action during these scenes was incredible, All gadgets were used, except one, which really would serve no purpose in the direction they went. Overall i will give it a 9/10 docking it for the inaccuracy about Pops, the transitions and some might not like the look of movie (i loved the look). If you are or were a fan of Speed Racer, i do recommend checking this movie out, And even if you are not check it out anyway. Great movie. Great Effects. Great Actors. Not the best movie in the world but I thoroughly enjoyed it.",Speed Racer
353,mrfilmfan,Black & White Flag Waves the Good Guys to Victory,7,11 May 2008,"Remembering the original ""Speed Racer"" television series as a ""must-see"" program on Saturday mornings or daily after school (the precise air-time I cannot recall), I was excited to learn that there would be a feature-film version about the coolest Racer in cartoon land. And unlike other cinematic versions of some of my old small-screen favorites, this one did not disappoint. From the very beginning, the visual effects were bold and appealing, the score and sound effects very complementary, and the mise-en-scène whimsical and dynamic. With ample doses of racing heroism, sentimental tugs on the heart strings, and simian humor (that means the monkey was funny), the storyline was spot-on and kept the audience rooting for the hero, while the dialogue ably supported the story and never stepped over any ""kid friendly"" bounds.The casting was excellent, with Emile Hirsch as our story's dauntless hero, John Goodman and Susan Sarandon as his imposing pater and faithful mater, Christina Ricci as Speed's sexy and resourceful love interest, and Roger Allam as the semi-psychotic nemesis. Besides Allam as Royalton, there were ample other villains for the great Speed Racer to subdue, which he and the entire Racer clan handily accomplished not only through driving, but also martial arts.A truly international production, the ""Speed Racer"" film benefited from the participation of American, German, Japanese, and numerous other contributors from around the globe. With Warner Brothers leading the American distribution, ""Speed Racer"" is indeed a triumph of the fabled Babelsberg studios; with the latter paying tribute to hometown Berlin with a prominent and festive scene of the Brandenburg Gate. I highly recommend ""Speed Racer"" for families, friends, or anyone desiring a spirited, fun-filled entertainment. How soon until the sequel?",Speed Racer

Not expecting much except for an afternoon pop-corn flick, I was pleasantly greeted with a Top-notch story, great stylistic acting, eye-catching imagery, and edge-gripping action. The 3D CG meshed well with the color-filled acid trip of a film.As a speed-racer fan of yore, I was scared this movie would disgrace it roots by bad interpretations of characters, divert the true heart of the series, and just overall not hold true to the spirit that is speed racer. I was very wrong in that and the W. Brothers do a brilliant translation of ye olde 70's small-time series to common era big-screen extravaganza.Great, memorable character, great memorable moments fill the screen in this 2hour delight.

355,nicolas-82,An impossible to miss masterpiece !,10,30 June 2008,"This is a comment for the art lovers among you. Ignorant that I am, I have never seen (or even heard of) the cartoon this film has apparently been based on, so here you go, I could not be let down or impressed by how well it fits the original plot. I went to see Speed Racer because of some rather sensational reviews (from serious reviewers). You remember the Matrix (silly question)? What I remember most from it is how radically new it was (effects, plot, etc ...). Speed Racer is just that!! They've done it again. In this case the plot is rather beside the point, well put together, but predictable and just supporting what you really should go and see this film for: the completely wacky and poetic style that underlines every frame. It's original, refreshing, will take your breath away at (numerous) times, it is a stunning art piece! The combination of anachronistic designs (cars mainly), eccentric characters, impossible physics, a surreal atmosphere that never pretends to make that film anything else than a super-cool tale, create an explosive cocktail that I found outstandingly harmonious. Despite the plethora of pedantic comments I read about deviations from the initial cartoon, this film is as pioneering and will be as influential to the cinema as the Matrix ever was. Go and see it in the biggest screen you can while it's still out at the movies, it's worth it! All my respect goes to the creators of this film, it's exceptional.",Speed Racer
356,awarlock00,W0rst M0vie in the WORLD,1,10 May 2008,"okay sure the racing scenes were brilliant, 10/10 for Computer Graphics. Every other moment in between was Corny, Poorly Acted, and generally Lame from the dialogue thru to the plot, and even the method of story telling was poor and confused. If you are a normal person you will want to bring a sledgehammer with you to this movie so you can continually pound it against your head as you are forced to listen to the emotional, sappy, boring, trite speeches given by each character. The fat kid who plays speeds youngest brother is the most annoying brat in history that adds nothing to the story, not even comic relief. The chimpanzee in the movie is about as entertaining as a dead cockroach. The entire movie would be understandable/forgivable if this movie were made for the target audience of children, but with all the long drawn out unnecessary corny emotional speeches that make up for 90% of the movie, even a kid would be like huh?

357,pinkpriscilla,Preposterous and Sublime,10,26 May 2008,"Like all these other reviewers, I have no idea why this movie is being considered a dud. Did they watch the same film I did??? It was visually spectacular, with that retro Jetson's look to the sets and costuming, the excellent acting, and the spirit absolutely true to the anime. The Wachowski brothers totally win!I do have to admit that Speed Racer was the love of my life when I was 10 years old, and probably responsible for my love of fast cars, as well as cementing in place the principles of honor and ethics my parents strove to teach me, so I have a bit of a bias...But wait. What's all this about the story having no plot? What?? Did these critics fall asleep or did the bright flashing colors put them in an epileptic coma? No, the plot is no Bourne Identity, or did they expect one of those convoluted Asian stories? Speed Racer is not intellectual material. It's pure popcorn fun with the only real conflict there is: Good Guys vs. Bad Guys, and how well the Good Guys measure up.Emile Hirsch was perfect as Speed. That doe-eyed, vulnerable look, along with the perfect costuming (can anyone forget the blue polo shirt with white cuffs and collar, and the red bandanna?) and the black hair falling into his eyes...Matthew Fox as Racer X was beyond perfect. The costume was spot-on in every way. He even sounded like the anime character.Paulie Litt as Sprytle stole every scene he was in, even without the chimp, and was so adorable that he didn't come close to being as obnoxious as the anime character.I could go on and on... and on... but it just makes me want to go see it again.For myself, sitting in that theater, hearing the distinctive sound of the jump springs for the first time in years made my eyes tear up.

No, don't pass it by, run quickly to the nearest exit and don't look back...ever. The Wachowski's, while very cleaver in fusing a Blade Runner sensibility into the Matrix franchise, were completely incapable of taking that same energy into this film. It was the notion of taking all the intense action set pieces of Matrix and adding a lot of neon to it. The characters are underdeveloped and relationships are stretched past the point of believability.

It feels like a movie that came out yesterday.The editing, and the way characters come into frame/out into the next scene is super cool. The colors are vibrant, the movie looks gorgeous, the action is well shot, it has a very unique way of story telling, and the story has heart. Its about a kid who loves racing, getting into the industry, but he realizes the nature of the industry lacks integrity. Actually kinda realistic since in real life racing is all about sponsors, and money. His family plays a big role, and each character gets their proper screen time; it feels like a family.People said who say ""its unrealistic"".. they just have no clue what they're talking about. A movie needs cohesion, everything in the movie down to colors needs to fit the movies tone/style, etc; but stupid people go into every movie with the same outlook. You don't go into a light hearted movie expecting it to have the same gravitas as the Dark Knight.. but thats how some people treated this movie when it came out, "" iT wAs tOo CaRtoOny"".

The race scenes are just incredible.The movie isn't exactly complex, very deep, or all that serious, but Speed Racer does a good job of giving you a movie conversion that doesn't feel half-empty (the first for me). It's aimed at children, but it's easy enough for adults to follow along with a little imagination.The good and the bad...Good:Great race scenes. Thrilling, like no other.Solid acting and dialogue.Enthralling world.The action-drama is well done. The plot and action are well integrated.The bad: Fast-moving, colorful graphics and flashes may cause dizziness and headaches. The ""cartoon"" effects and kid's stuff are a bit distracting to adults. Kids like it though. Very little ""real racing"" appeal. While that's not the point, the movie is about racing. The car combat was definitely fun, but a bit more actual racing stuff might have been a better balance. The action sequences are somewhat disjoint. Things seem to jump around.Although Speed Racer has some flaws, I give it a 10 because some of the race scenes were an experience unlike anything else. You really feel like you're witnessing something amazing.",Speed Racer

366,swaddle6,Way too long !,4,12 May 2008,"This movie could have been half an hour shorter if it didn't have those stupid over long speeches in it. If the entire movie was one long race then it might have been good. Also the fact that his brother didn't die and got plastic surgery to look like Mathew fox was terrible.He is his brother, then he isn't, then he is again. Make up your mind Andy and Larry. I also still believe that the movie would have be exctactly the same without the kid and the monkey. So overall i believe all the good bits were in the trailer, they could have tuned the colours down a bit and added a lot more racing. Iron man was sooooooooo much better ! enough said !",Speed Racer
367,noodleplugerine,The best experience I have ever had in a Cinema.,10,12 May 2008,"Me, and all my friends entered the cinema, expecting a bad film. Harmless entertainment, with simple fast cars, and bright lights.What we actually saw, was jaw dropping.Hilarious, ridiculous, and brilliant. Never before have I found myself on the edge of my seat quite as much as during this film.The pacing was great, the characters were interesting, and pretty well performed.Many people will slate this film for its lack of depth, but personally I think that's the whole point, its a film of distilled personality. Colourful, exciting, and incredibly fun.Although childish at times, it is forgiven, considering this is a remake of a children's cartoon (which I've never seen properly I might add, however many people say it is being accurate to the original).The CGI was awe inspiring, and a comment I read earlier summed it up really, it was something along the lines of, ""How did this film ever get green lighted?"".Truly, NOTHING has ever been done similarly to this film, it was a huge risk, and a huge success, in the future I demand movies be as fun as Speed Racer - It was superb.A MUST watch for anyone with humour - Those after a dramatic, thespian performance, may want to look further, however, those wanting a truly epic cinematic experience - Watch Speed Racer.",Speed Racer
368,OGlobo,champion of bore,1,7 May 2008,"When I was a kid I really like the Speed Racer's cartoons, 'cause it brings to me a different approach in the genre, like no other cartoon on television. Everything is joyful: the characters, the theme song, the cars, the races... so, when I leave the room where a premiere of the Speed racer action movie was presented, I was extremely sad.What I watched was a slow, bore, lifeless movie, trying to disguise behind a million of colours and special effects. The actors are lame (even the good ones, like john goodman), the plot is pointless, the race scenes are artificial and cold... I understand that the wachowski brothers are trying to do a innovative movie, but they failed badly.I think the only demographic that wanna like this movie are the small children (under ten) who likes video games like mario kart, for instance. I don't know if I expected so much, but it's a big no no.",Speed Racer
369,drwillis-1,A lot of Fun on a Big Screen with an amped sound system!,8,12 May 2008,"Speed Racer was viewed at a Carmike Cinema in DLP with DTS sound.The first aspect, most in your face part of this movie, of course, is the visuals and sound. Colors are vibrant and well received on DLP format. The sound is simply stunning in the DTS. That being said, this is the type of movie in which those things were intended to be used. The story is typical, as with any child's film. You have the hero of the story, obsessed with being the best hero he can be. Speed Racer starts out a little slow with some of the background information, but all in all the pacing seemed to fit the movie quite well. All of the characters are one dimensional as they should be.***Personal Opinion Alert*** Let it be a reminder this is not There Will Be Blood, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Fargo, The Pianist(all movies of cinema and acting merit), and should not be held to the same standard of dialogue or on screen character development. No one cares in this case if Speed has an alcohol problem, or a secret child porn ring. It is Speed Racer, I think some people have forgotten that in viewing this film in comparison of the W's earlier work. Now, I do not want to turn this review into a ""How to watch a movie bashing"" so I'll stop with the personal opinion here.Acting performances were spot on compared with the cartoon, and most of the dialogue was well adapted from the series. If there are any negatives to this other wise perfect representation of a summer blockbuster, it is with the lull at the beginning of the movie. However, it should be noted that this character building at the beginning, though tedious and a little monotone, wraps with the movie well by the end of the viewing. To say more bluntly, It was a little confusing to start with, but you easily catch on after the first ten minutes. To conclude, this film is a must see for a summer blockbuster junkie. This is the reason you get excited about films like Independence Day, or Die Hard, or Terminator 2, you go to the movies and share some popcorn and a good time. Personal Recommendations: See film either in IMAX format or DLP screening(commented by other friends that viewing in regular projection theaters lost some of the edginess with visuals)A must see with DTS, really keeps the viewer engaged in the adrenaline rush(also, commented by friends that the action was lacking in regular digital sound theaters)This is not an Oscar nominee, except for maybe visuals and sound editing, keep that in mind while viewing this masterpiece of fun. Saying the characters are not deep enough or script is one dimensional is like trying to find deep philosophical meaning by watching the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles re-runs.Go to the Movies and have Fun.",Speed Racer
370,mitchloidolt,Great cartoon adaptation,9,10 May 2008,"Speed Racer fulfilled my expectations, which were all about bringing to life the cartoon I first came to know of in gradeschool, staying up past my bedtime and watching MTV and being amazed. It beat the pants off of that Wacky Racers cartoon by miles.At 2 hours and 20 minutes, one might think it would drag on forever, or that it would become dull. What saves it is that there's always an element around the corner ready to kick the film into high gear again. Because of that, it never seemed like there was much of a lull, and it felt like the 2+ hours of content were packed into a half hour episode.A few reviews I've read have mentioned fuschia vomit and ice cream headaches, and I've got to say that anyone that would think that's the defining quality of this movie has only seen the trailer. The bulk of the movie is indeed colorful, as a cartoon has full rights to be, but it's not a Colbertian fireworks in a washing machine experience that will leave you looking for something to puke in, as some would've felt in Cloverfield. So to get to the point. Speed Racer the movie is the cartoon come to life. It's PG. It has intense racing, cheesy dialogue, awesome fighting and beautiful art direction. It's a cartoon, and if you like cartoons, go see Speed Racer.",Speed Racer
371,raffray7,Razzie Contender,1,14 May 2008,"Brought my 8 year old daughter and her friends to see this movie. Was expecting nothing. It was awful on every possible level. Made me wish I was watching Norbit instead !!! I am usually not picky about movies, even kids' movies. This was simply painful. It was like taking a 15mn cartoon episode (and all the defects that go with it - no plot, no logical transitions, etc.) stretched into a 2 hour movie. The same special effects are repeated over and over and over (and did I say over?) again, to the point it's sickening. As I write this I cannot think of one movie combining such horrible acting, unintelligent story (that was to be expected anyway) ... am actually lacking words to describe how bad of an experience this was.And by the way, I never saw the cartoon series as a kid, so it's not like I was a fan and was disappointed with what they did of something I liked.Seems like the kids enjoyed it, so it was not a total waste of time/money.",Speed Racer
372,Akusokuzangatots,And the anime trend starts,6,10 May 2008,"To start out I'm a pretty avid anime fan. while i would like to see animes adapted into films because there is so much untapped potential Hollywood hasn't realized yet I'm not sure if they can pull it off. Im kinda glad they started with speed racer though seeing as its a 70's show with pretty basic animation so they could do a lot with it in terms of look. Part of me is kinda glad the Wachowski's did what they did because i couldn't of scene it any other way.First things first the look of the movie. The universal focus in the background and foreground to give it that anime look to it is pretty impressive. But at some moments it still could of looked better especially some of the city scenery. But the main focus of the movie which is the racing the cgi is PERFECT i was truly impressed by the way it looked. And there are some scenes that really do stand out from the rest that i found interesting and provocative. They are the shoot out scene on the highway when everything goes inferred they slowmo some parts to it, it really does look frickin awesome straight up. Another one is the finish line scene at the very end it does come off as this almost epic feel to it, the colors blend so well on it you just cant help but be impressed.The acting throwout the movie is nothing to special but its nothing to horrible. i am becoming a bigger and bigger Emilie Hirsch fan every time one of his movies comes out. He delivers a solid performance along with john Goodman who doesn't get the recognition he should. But there is this one Asian who was SOOOOOOOOOOOO HORRIBLE. I seriously just wanted her to just fall off a cliff and not come back into any other scenes. And i almost forgot about Roger Allam i think is his name if not then my bad. but he played a pretty convincing diabolical villain.The story. Well come on people its a CARTOON SHOW FROM THE 70'S!!!!! how much can you expect from that? People may criticize it for having no character depth or a shallow story line but really look at what the brothers had to start out with. You can tell they tried to stay true to the story line and keep it pg even though they say ass like 5 times. They weren't trying to go for depth just and enjoyable lighthearted movie which the series was.truthfully this movie is perfect for your little kids and even some of the parents. Its exciting, fast paced, and well just good to look at.Also a little side note. ANIME STYLE EDITING BABY OH YAH!!!!!!!!!! GOTTA LOVE IT.",Speed Racer
373,wmkylee,I loved it,9,10 May 2008,"Acting was good, story was fair, music was very good and........... visual was AWESOME. The whole time I was watching the movie, I felt like riding a roller-coaster. It was totally a new experience. It also reminded me of racing car game i used to play with my PSI I will safely assume that if you like video games and cartoons (especially the original speed racer), you will enjoy this movie. But then i have to admit, it's not for everyone. Some may say it's story-lacking, childish, and cartoon-like. I saw a lot of young boys with their daddy in the theater. But for me, it was such an awesome movie. I would absolutely go see it again",Speed Racer

375,rabit818-1,Art?,1,3 January 2009,"Speed Racer and the word ""art"" should not be use in the same sentence. Especially for someone who has not seen The Matrix, which by the way is revolutionary. Probably one of the best movies of the nineties. Action movies were never the same again after The Matrix. Same can be said with Pulp Fiction, The Sixth Sense, to name a few. Pulp Fiction's narrative is non linear, exciting and funny. The Sixth Sense is well acted, the characters are sympathetic and a great story. Those films are groundbreaking one way or another. Granted the special effect on this movie is cool, what it needs is control. Too much primary colors enough to give to permanently damage your iris. Now back to ""art"", see The Seventh Seal before you use the word in a haphazard way.",Speed Racer
376,rflux_dev,"A car race movie with a lot of heart, with an equal screen space treatment to the international actors, plus the blown-up candy store world of course.",7,12 May 2008,"At first, you will find it hard to accept the production design, the whole speed racer world is a blown-up candy store, everything is so colorful, flashy, lively and retro.But the first race scene will introduce you to the various camera techniques that you will see throughout the whole movie. The story, it is a modified version of the original anime. Once you get immersed in the story which was seamlessly initiated and developed along with an intense car race scene, your eyes and mind will (i hope it will because mine did) adjust and adapt to the production design and the way the story will go. The intro served its purpose really well.I like their attempt to faithfully portray the characters, the attitude of anime characters are intact (the kid sidekick of Speed along with the monkey is kinda OA for me, but its forgivable)Next is how the actors themselves are treated in the material. I salute the equal exposure in the screen space given to the Asian, British and American actors in the movie. The actor that played the role of Speed did not give a monumental performance but it is not a bad performance also, its just right. I would like to commend the Korean actor Rain, he gave a nice performance in the movie, He is not an Asian actor that is featured in a Hollywood movie only to be wasted, he was used up to maximum, that it gave him a chance to really show how good an actor he is.Costume design is good to, very faithful to the anime. musical score, is fit also. And the thing i liked best about the movie, are the touching father and son, mother and son, brother to brother, friend to friend dialogs. It really surprised me because my first impression about the movie(based on the trailers) is that the movie will just be all about flashy, Wii Mario Kart-like race scenes. But not. It is a car race movie with a lot of heart, I found my self misty-eyed in some dialog and back-story scenes.It turned out to be a good mothers day movie, I watch it with my mom, she won the tickets in a mothers day raffle, it turned out to be a good win after all. The movie has a heart. To those who will watch, bring your Wii controller, it may add up to the thrill of the race scene (that is if you are willing to look silly inside the movie house).",Speed Racer

All my doubts had gone after the first 20 minutes of this film, seeing the races in full colour and quality is really quite breathtaking and feels like your in the race yourself, the film had some great jokes and laughs bundled in which is a bonus along with a great storyline and well written script it moves the story along at the right speed and pace unlike other films (Jumper). The annoying thing about the film is the really noticeable graphic quirks and jitters which on a standard screen are unnoticeable but on a big screen are really easy to spot. Apart from that its a great film and could have done with some 3D add-ons but its enjoyable, funny and well worth the money!",Speed Racer

This movie will definitely leave you rooting for the good guys as you did when you were a kid and will no doubt leave you wanting more.Its a shame that so many haven't enjoy this great movie.

This movie is hands down the funnest movie I've seen to date, giving off an adrenaline rush to die for from start(15 minutes into the movie, yet still good beforehand) to finish, and an Orgasm to the Retinas kind of feeling. However, some of the music choices(i.e. the ending credits and some scenes)are quite corny and too J-Pop like, giving me a odd feeling that they wanted to staple some stuff in for the kids. As good as the *psychadellic world is in this movie, i would wish for the classic style or relevant to it would have been *incorperated in. Yet all in all. It's fun and Brilliant.

It was fun and simple.. There is no way this was going to be a thought provoking film. any real racing would have been underwhelming. This was a cartoon with over the top racers and insane races. I have a feeling that it will have a longer shelf life than the standard blockbuster. My theater was filled with kids and parents. I had seen Iron man earlier in the day and there were far less kids there. Hollywood doesn't usually give us very good kid films in the summer .. at least nothing I want to see.Go see it and enjoy a fun flashy film.,Speed Racer
381,alphonse1234,This movie was epic? More like epic FAIL.,1,14 May 2008,"I knew this movie was gonna be bad from the moment I saw the trailer. I didn't judge it right off the bat, I wanted to wait 'til I saw it first. I already didn't like the cast they picked, and the headache visuals. And all the people who said this followed the anime 100% need their heads examined, because this has a lot of things screwed up. What the hell is the Mach 6? And who's this Australian dufus they hired to play Sparky? Why does Inspector Detector look like some stupid Johnny Depp look a like? What's with the bad puns? (eg ""Ninjas? More like nonjas."" What the hell was that?), and the races and race tracks have more in common with IGPX Immortal Grand Prix than Speed Racer. There's been a long history of classic cartoons that have been DESTROYED by Hollywood, because they're greedy and selfish. They don't put any thought into ANYTHING. Examples of this include Dick Tracy, Dudley Do Right, Underdog, Alvin & The Chipmunks, and now this great anime that I grew up with and loved as a child. At least the film's failing in the box office, and that's good. And the critics are tearing it a new asshole, and this is one time where the critics are right. The film makers were smoking some bad stuff when they came up with this train wreck. Congratulations Wachowski Brothers, you ruined your own career. Enjoy your failure, because you WILL NOT be forgiven. We needed a better director like Steven Spielberg, John Landis, Ron Howard, Joe Dante or Robert Zemeckis for this kind of project, not two guys who only made one good movie out of 4 ones before Speed Racer. Don't see this movie. Iron Man was a lot better. No, Iron Man was EXCELLENT, and this movie, what the hell is this? And don't let anyone tell you otherwise and say things like ""This movie was awesome!"", because they're lying, and if they say ""This movie is underrated!"", they're wrong, because it's not underrated.

382,friendfamilyfour,Speed Racer better than expected,8,13 May 2008,"As a rabid fan of the classic Speed Racer anime from 1966 for well over thirty years, I found much to appreciate in this retelling. There were many references to the original including sounds, music clips, and certain slap-stick routines with Spritle and chim-chim. I would have preferred a less candy coated version with more violence like in the original and less new characters (there were many great characters in the original).My children (aged 15 and 10) enjoyed the movie as well with the only criticism being that the ""world"" appeared to bright and not-realistic. The races were excellently done and for a set-up movie of a story of this type it is remarkably well done.This has promise to be a successful series if people give it a chance because it is the kind of movie that will improve with repeated viewings. Give this move a chance, it is well worth the time spent.",Speed Racer

The AHA monitors the treatment of animals on set. The film is unacceptable because a chimpanzee was beaten during production in the presence of an AHA Representative. In other words, Speed Racer will not receive AHA's ""No animals were harmed"" stamp of approval. Considering this was made in the United States, we need to stand up for the rights of animals and the guidelines our society has set for cinema.Food for thought: If a trainer committed this level of abuse in front of a concerned party, imagine what takes place behind closed doors.",Speed Racer

Aside from the Spritle/Chim Chim moments, every scene in the movie made sense and also aside from the Spritle/Chim Chim moments, the film kept a very good pace.The special effects are what they are. It's a unique visual experience that some people will love, others will hate, and still others like myself will be rather apathetic about.The main thing that brings this movie down to a 6, when it could easily have been a 9 is the useless, and horribly pointless Spritle/Chim Chim scenes. If they were treated more like Sparky was in this movie, this movie would rank right up there with Iron Man. Cut out their cut-scenes, and stupid moments/comments, and not only do you keep a great pace, but the movie time probably goes from 130 minutes to about 110 minutes. And their scenes are so pointless, you really could cut them out and show the movie to someone who's never seen it and they'd be none the wiser and not the least bit confused. In fact, I think I'll be the one to do that when it comes out on DVD...I understand they're characters in the movie, but they really just needed to be introduced, and be found in the trunk of the Mach 5 every once in awhile...One critic said they're the new Jar Jar Binks, and he's dead on about that...",Speed Racer

Being one of the frequent viewers of Speed Racer (the old anime) before, I thought I should not miss this. I used to watch this cartoon during my elementary and early high school days at Cartoon Network.Well, it turned out to be a wonderful ride. Before going inside the movie house, I kinda expected it to be a ""pure cotton candy"" movie, so I just wanted to know if this will be a good transformation of the told cartoon.It was one of the coolest movie in this genre in recent years. Darn, the editing, sequencing, it was awesome. It was exhilarating. The visual effects are a given, what can you expect from the same team behind the Matrix? Some people, however, do not seem to appreciate the film. I guess that will be acceptable if you have seen the cartoon before, but if not, then don't give it a bad review since you know nothing about the source material. Honestly, I was glued to my seat the whole time, it made me become a bigger fan of racing myself, or even better, it felt as if my chairs were moving. Haha. Some were questioning about it being flashy. I guess that's what made it a ""modern-day"" adaptation of the film. To me, it was just fine. The film did what it exactly had to do, which is to entertain and give justice to the cartoon.The best part of the movie is the Casa Cristo 5000, when Speed, Racer X and Taejo teamed up to win the race in an effort to make a difference in the world of racing that is filled with politics.However, it is not Speed Racer that is the coolest character in the film, even if the characters behind Speed, Trixie, and Pops, were really look alikes of the cartoon characters. For me, the coolest character was Racer X, who turned out to be Speed's brother, Rex Racer. In the TV series, Rex Racer revealed his identity with a punch in the stomach. In the movie, however, Rex Racer had a plastic surgery in order to change his identity. When Racer X showed himself to Speed due to the latter's doubt, a seemingly different person was revealed. After the 91st grand prix, Racer X mentioned that if the choice of not telling his family about his identity was a mistake, it will be a mistake he'll have to live with. While this portion in the film made the difference against the old anime, I also felt that it's the most striking part of the movie.The lines were hilarious too, and the fight scenes were crazy, especially on the scene when some nasty bad guys tried to ambush Speed's team, only to be ruined by Spritle, Speed's naughty and funny younger brother. Haha.I hope that in this genre, movie makers will keep on producing movies like this. :-)Pinoy Potter's Chronicles",Speed Racer

Some of the dialog scenes are just way too slow.As long as you understand this is just a mostly live-action cartoon/anime/comic and don't have epilepsy, you'll have a good time with this. But the racing parts were fantastic and the whole story was great. The design seems to be to take you into a video game, and it works pretty well. You have to take it no more seriously than you would Mario Kart to get it. People who don't like it don't seem to be able to ""get it"" and get into the Speed Racer fantasy world.The closing credit sequence was great fun. Hilarious fight scenes.

The Wachowski brothers did not disappoint. This movie was far better than I had expected, it was a visual masterpiece. The special effects in this movie worked perfectly. It made the film seem more futuristic, even a little more kid-like, but its perfect for the whole family. It has a great plot, and I was near moved to tears by the end! There's enough comedy to keep you connected to the movie the entire time. The action scenes also added another element to this film that makes it a must see. Being a loyal Emile Hirsch fan I'm glad to say that he did an outstanding job once again. He gave a great performance that I've come to expect from him. He WAS Speed Racer. Nicholas Elia who plays the younger version of Speed, and Paulie Litt who plays Speed's younger brother, Spridle, were unexpected surprises. They both did amazing jobs with their characters. As well as Susan Sarandon (Speed's mum), John Goodman (Speed's dad), and Christina Ricci (Trixie). This film was full of great actors and it definitely shows on screen.

After reading some of the reviews in the paper I was a little worried, but when I went to see it I was pleasantly surprised. I don't know what the critics were expecting but it must have been something different. Have they never seen the original Speed Racer cartoon? They did a nice job with the transition and made an enjoyable experience. I have seen it twice now, once with my kids and they thought it was ""awesome""!

Those which are most meaningful to 40-something boys and girls, who watched too much TV after coming home from school: Theme songs, visual clichés, simple story lines, and characters to whom those kids were exposed repeatedly, as though undergoing a religious education.

The whole movie is a CGI + Green Screen psychedelic trip with a wooden acting.Had they made the movie without using Speed Racer, it would have been better. If you never watched the cartoon, you may like it. But having grown up watching the cartoon, I hated it. A vindictive Speed Racer goes a far left from the idealist and purist of the original.

392,eternaldaydreamer08,Stand Up and Cheer!,9,17 May 2008,"I completely agree. This movie will not be well received, however, it will become one of the great to join the infamous cult titles. I personally thought this movie was a thrill ride from beginning to blaring end. Admittedly, it took a little to get used to the flashy colors. The critics are not accustomed to reviewing a movie such as this. It's new, loud (in more ways than one), and slightly childish.The special effects were amazing! Bright, garish, CHEESY! A wonderful combination! It had all of the roots of a classic, sketchy anime, yet, THE MATRIX origins were clear. I lost count of how many times that movie had me dropping my jaw or bouncing in my chair squeeling at the racing scenes. All I can say is that if racing was that exciting in real life, I would be a HUGE fan. The story was easy to follow for those of us who had not been avid fans of the oldies anime. Not to mention the fact that SPEED RACER had so much slap-stick humor that you absolutely could not make it through without laughing at least once. This is a movie that requires you to go with a fun-loving group who has no problem screaming for the races. Don't go into this movie and expect to see a serious film. Go for the fun of it all. I can promise you that it'll have you screaming, ""Go, Speed Racer, Go!""",Speed Racer

Are we to say to small children that it is okay to flip people off??? The movie was very action packed and had great animation put it should not be rated PG. The people who rate the movies need to pay more attention to things like that and know that there are lots of parents that take the ratings seriously by what they let their children go see.

I can however appreciate what was attempted and note that the story was okay but while these effects were good they did make me feel like I was playing Wipeout HD on my PS3!!! I also imagine that the experience would be even more similar had I previously popped an acid tablet??

Didn't Susan Sarandon once play Jane Goodall? No, that was Sigourney Weaver as Dian Fossey. The bad guy looks like Tim Curry, but isn't. Still, you know he's the bad guy by virtue of the resemblance. I tell you what, though, if my car breaks down, I'm taking it to John Goodman Tire. He can build a car in 32 hours! From scrap! For a fast-paced car, it sure is a slow movie. The slipstream editing leaves you wondering if someone forgot to press ""compile"". I'm not sure it was meant for human consumption; though I'm positive a computer could understand it. The first third of the movie is presented as if time does not exist. Director Wachowski pushes lack of chronology past the margin of artistic, and into confusing. The movie is incorrectly rated PG, when it should have been PhD for cognitive ability required.Go go see SPEED RACER! Nice Mormon family like that with five kids, including a chimpanzee and spittle in the trunk. And Susan Sarandon doesn't look a day older than her plastic surgery.",Speed Racer

I own the original ""movie"" on VHS, and couldn't wait to see it. I liked the plot, characters, and just about everything about it. They even used the original sound effects for the jump jacks! All of the special effects were quite realistic. What could you expect, though, these guys directed The Matrix, which made me want to see this more. The runtime was perfect, and I was glad they were able to fit everything they needed to in. This movie was overall enjoyable, contained all of the things you'd expect from Speed Racer, and took just enough from the original series to make you go ""Oh, I remember that!"" without letting those who don't know Speed get left in the dust.",Speed Racer

398,piotrmarkovicz,I get caught up every time,9,31 July 2009,"It's clear from the comments that the reasons the people who don't like this movie don't like it is because it is too long, too bright, too flashy, not true to the original they way they remembered it and incomprehensibleI can see that. When I first watched it with my kids in the theater, it was long, it was a challenge to follow all the cuts back and forth through time and space, and the characters, the action, the cartoon colors and shiny plastic CGI is over-the-top.But that's the point, it is over-the-top. It is a big, loud, fast-paced cartoon/comic book that makes no attempt to make Speed Racer grounded in the real world.And like all the people who like this movie, it is because the movie actually succeeds in doing what it sets out to do and it does it with a bang and a flourish. It is a fantastic trip that peaks at the zen moment of speed racer's life and, if you get caught up in it, it takes you with him.I loved the original series as a kid, and this is not a straight remake of the series. It takes the series, finds a key premise in the anime--that winning a race in a super car is a penultimate world-changing experience--and drives it home every step of the way.It is a family movie but it is not a movie for young children but only due to its length and complexity. The colors, patterns and rhythm are reminiscent of the pop culture of the original series and in many ways pay homage to movies like Fantasia (Toccata And Fugue In D Minor) and 2001: A Space Odyssey (the cosmic tunnel sequence). The characters are drawn broadly but played with a distilled intensity. You never get the feeling that any of them don't believe in what they are doing.It clearly is a ""love-it"" or ""hate-it"" movie. I don't see anyone coming out and saying that it's mediocre. The average score for this movie is an average of two extreme scores, not a bell curve. If you hated it, I have to say you missed the experience that the lovers got out of it. And since there is such a dichotomy in opinion, it must be a masterpiece.",Speed Racer

After the disappointing last installment of the Matrix films I hoped the Wachowski brothers would return with something visually exciting and well-written. Speed Racer is a visual mess. Yes, there really is such a thing as too much cgi(computer generated imagery). The story as well is poorly written. I won't spoil any plot points for those who have not seen it, but let's just say I was never really excited about anything that was happening in this movie. Are there any surprises in this film?

403,stonierocks,Review from a fan of the TV show,6,29 July 2009,"Speed Racer has to be in my top 5 of my all-time favorites of TV shows. When it was a new TV show, it was the only cartoon like it. The word ""Anime"" is used now to describe that type of cartoon show. The word might have been around back then for all I know, but I never heard it. It was called ""Japanimation"" years after I watched that show, and years before I ever heard the word ""Anime"". I'm not even an Anime fan now, but I loved Speed Racer when I was a kid and even into my teenage years.I have never been a fan of old TV shows and cartoons made into movies. Not that I wasn't interested in some of them before I saw them. I always seem to be disappointed in the end result. So I was skeptical when I heard Speed Racer was going to be a movie, and not an animated one at that. Part of my skepticism was that the TV show was, well, cheesy. It was a car racing fantasy genuinely made for kids, and not meant to be serious. The movie finally came on an HD movie channel that I subscribe to, so I thought ""what the hell, watch it"".The movie was a pleasant surprise to me. It maintained it's childish cheese factor from the TV show, and combined it with a pretty good story and very good computer animation and action. By cheese factor, I mean the laws of physics don't apply in the world of Speed Racer. People don't expect that kind of reality in a child's action cartoon, but somehow do in a live-action movie. I think Speed Racer will probably get a bad rap in that respect, but you have to keep in mind that it is being true to its original TV show. The action parts are almost 100% animation because of this, and that is what I think really made the movie better than I expected. If they had tried to make this a racing movie in the style of the original TV show using real cars (even faked real cars if that makes sense), it would have blown the whole movie for me.For some remake fans, the storyline is everything. Comicbook-to-movie fans are probably the worse about this. I personally don't care as long as it's entertaining. I will address it a bit here though, for the curious. I watched the TV show as a kid. Complex and season-long story lines weren't a concept I cared or knew about then. Since I never watched Speed Racer as an adult, I couldn't tell you if the movie's version was accurate. I can tell you that the main characters from the TV show (Speed, Pops, Trixie, Racer-X, and Spirtle) were well represented and accurate. The movie's story came from the show or the Wachowski Brothers, that both wrote and directed the movie, made up a good one. Either way, it was entertaining.",Speed Racer
404,chunt09,Speed Racer Summary,7,2 March 2010,"This is my review of the movie Speed Racer featuring Emile Hirsch. Although this movie plummeted at the box offices and many critics and people so not think it is a good movie, I actually really, really like Speed Racer. I thought the actors and actresses all had very good chemistry together. I liked that the movie was not filmed on a set, and that all of the backdrops were CGIed. I though it added to the futuristic effect that the movie was trying to achieve. I was able to get lost in a world that does not exist. I thought this movie was very well done. This is one of those movies that I could watch more than once.",Speed Racer
405,jj-jesus92,"As with most of the Wachowski's works, Speed Racer is generally misunderstood",9,14 December 2010,"After reading seanwalker's review of Speed Racer, I feel compelled to write a positive review in light of such skepticism.First off, this is not some stupid trolling endeavor. The guy who wrote that review is clearly intelligible, he just didn't get this movie.Speed Racer, as do all Wachowski movies, has a theme: family. Speed Racer captures the ideal family in a realistic way, showing the conflicts between child and parents with the coming of age, first with Rex Racer and then with Speed Racer. In this film, the power of strength in family overcomes all odds, all conspiracies, and all evil. When all ideals of goodness seem to fade, family still remains strong. It may be a somewhat simple message, but the message runs deeply throughout the film, and, after all, this is a family movie.Though the effects were likewise phenomenal, after Royalton's speech, you can't possibly say this movie isn't deep. Once again, the Wachowski's apply multidimensional philosophy into their film, a feat that hasn't been done before in a family film, at least not that I can immediately recall.And finally, we are faced with everyone's biggest complaint about Speed Racer: the big cheese. The cheesiness will make you cringe occasionally, but that's not to say that it isn't intentional. Fans of the original series will tell you that the corniness and overdone comic relief were part of what made the series what it is. As the great Tarentino would do, the Wachowski's stay true to their original content, and not only include each character of the original series, but portray them as they've always been portrayed, with Racer X as the only character without a ridiculous, cheesy scene.Speaking of Racer X, how about some praise for this movie instead of just counterargument! Racer X's portrayal is wonderful! This may be a spoiler, but honestly, if you don't know by now that ""Racer X is really Rex Racer, the older brother of Speed who ran away from home years ago and is secretly racing behind the mask and the wheel of the number nine, the shooting star"" then you probably need to go watch the series. As an older brother, I find Racer X to be a heart-wrenching character. Not only does he posses the inner fire to do whatever it takes outside of cheating to liberate the sport of his passion, but he will sacrifice even more for the good of his family, though disowned by them. He is the icon of sacrifice, passion, and, yes, badassery. And still, within a family film! If you're a fan of the series, you will love this movie. It has literally everything the series had, corniness and all, but also a deeper message about family. The racing scenes, which I have little about, are indisputably enamoring, fast paced, sleek, and full of the crazy stunts and devices the old series had. Any fan of the series will love this movie.For everyone else, the cheese may be unbearable. Some people just don't feel the pull to be open minded to corniness, especially when it comes to family movies, and that's understandable, just make sure you know that this corniness doesn't spring from poor direction. Also, as with The Incredibles, those that don't relate so well to messages of family strength, or those that don't want to see a coming of age movie, no matter how well down, will also experience distaste for this film. But whether it's your cup of tea or not, this is a well done movie with depth, passion, and of course mind-blowing color and effects.",Speed Racer

Even though my wife commented about 1/3rd the way in that the movie was a bit dumb, it turned out to just be a slow part. It really picked up and we all found ourselves rooting for team racer! This movie is a bit long, but it's a real win with a great over all message. Cheaters never win. This movie does!

Hard to remember a flick they enjoyed that much. Anyone who gives this a ""serious"" review needs to check their age at the door.

The effects are top notch and unique, the story is far more complex than the original source material while at the same time paying homage to it, and the casting is superb with maybe one or two exceptions. The main issue with the movie that people have with it is it's perceived gayness. Which, really, is taken from the source material. Another issue is that people were probably expecting something different than what they got. They were expecting something gritty and philosophically deeper than what they got. But eve then it has a fairly decent moral at the end. I love this movie! Give this movie a chance, leave your preconceived notions at the door and have a hell of a lot of fun.",Speed Racer

But, it was a complete let down. There was no real story except that Speed was a great racer and that he will win the final race at the end. Plus, it felt like it took three hours to tell that story. I don't know what they were thinking making the movie so long and boring, especially when they are targeting kids under five years old. And the biggest complaint I had with the movie is that I never felt that it was a realistic portrayal of racing. It felt like a video game because you always felt like you were watching an animation and not that the actors were really driving in a car. It was too obvious that it was all done in a room where the driving was animated behind them. And the car jumps felt a bit repetitious after the 87th flip during a race.",Speed Racer
410,zenislev619,A Fresh Fantastic Thrill Ride,10,5 March 2014,"I'll humbly admit that I was late to the party with this movie. I watched it after seeing a tiny bit of it in a store display, then decided to grab a copy one night and take the plunge. I was NOT disappointed. When the plans were announced, I was excited and at the same time miffed that they were taking one of my favorite Japanese Anime as a Kid and turning it into a live action film. Like any adaptation to the silver screen, it's either going to be a hit or a miss. Knowing the Wachowskis were associated with the film gave me hope, but having gone through my fair share of adaptations, (Alone in the Dark, Doom, etc) I went in thinking it was going to be something I would turn off within the first few minutes and be thankful I didn't pay to see it in a theater. Boy was I wrong.Rather than try and personify the anime into a real world setting, the movie sticks to a campy, almost alternate style of the show. Bright colors and the funky clothing and a small sense of 50's style gave it the feel, then the racing sequences with cars with large boosters attached to them, Racetracks with large jumps, pipes and vertical sections of track. It's like they took Speed Racer, mixed in a little bit of Nintendo's fantastic racer F-Zero, shoved it all into a rocket and pressed ""Go."" The Casting was also very good and their performance was all I could ask for with an adaptation. Having John Goodman as Pops actually gave me a chuckle because he personified the character so well, as does the rest of the cast. The overall plot of the film was classic Speed Racer fare, Almost like they took some of the best episodes from the series and amalgamated them all into one story. Certainly no complaints there.I certainly heard my fair share of complaints about this movie, mostly from nostalgic fans (myself included) who were worried that the movie would taint their memories of the show.(Really? The Mach 6? REALLY?) But if you go into this movie without that prejudice it really does take you on a wild ride. Would I recommend this movie? Absolutely.

I wouldn't be surprised if there were numerous epileptic fits by people watching this. And there probably should be warnings of the psychedelic graphics in the cinema foyer similar to those put on the Sonic The Hedgehog game back in the '90s. That said, I found the movie quite entertaining. My only exposure to the original anime was that I may have watched a couple of episodes that Aunty ABC screened many moons ago. The storyline mediocre, the visuals awesome; the one thing that really p!$$ed me off was that annoying fat kid and his stupid monkey. I do realise that this is a kids movie, but that doesn't mean that they have to write a moronic character in that will ruin the film for everyone that is over the age of 2.

The effects may have been excessive at times, however the bright visuals were generally playful and true to the classic speed racer comics. The cinematography in this movie seemed to have come straight out of a comic, which I personally didn't mind at all. I liked the way this film was shot and found the racing scenes to be, while unrealistic, captivating and intense. This movie has a great cast and strong plot line, and find this movie to be extremely underestimated. Overall, I would say that anyone who is a Speed Racer fan or fan or racing movies would like this movie, or anyone looking for a nice, clean, adventure movie.",Speed Racer
416,Becky814,Great Adaptation,9,9 May 2008,"Fantastic adaptation of the anime. Stayed very faithful to the TV show while taking it up a couple notches. The special effects work so well; while everything doesn't look realistic, it was intentional to have the ""live-action cartoon"" effect and it worked very well.What surprised me most about the movie was the acting. Given how cheesy the anime is and the silly dub, the actors/actresses bring life to the characters, though the cheesy factor remains. Trust me, this movie is very cheesy, but the good kind. For the most part, everyone seems human. Awesome, awesome cast. The movie also explores the family's relationship as well as Speed's relationship with Rex, which was never really present in the anime, so it was a nice touch.And the FAN SERVICE!! It was literally all over the damn place. Whatever was in the cartoon, you better believe it's in the movie somewhere.While the movie starts out in a very nonlinear fashion, it's not too hard to follow when you realize what's going on. The last two races, the Casa Cristo and the Grand Prix were spectacular and a sight to behold over and over again; the first two races are really just relatively short clips.Despite some of the use of ""screen wiping"" (ie: characters moving across the screen and introducing a new scene) used for transitions, which was neat at first but kind of got annoying as the movie went on, and that Speed Racer could have been about fifteen minutes shorter and still be just as good, I'm very pleased with the final results. It's definitely not a movie for everyone; though I can't see how a die hard fan could not like this movie, but then again there's no such thing as a movie that pleases everyone.As long as you go into the theater knowing that Speed Racer is a fun film and like the anime, defies all laws of physics and is insanely campy/goofy, you should enjoy it. I've been waiting to see Speed on the big screen since the late '90's, and it was well worth the wait for me.",Speed Racer

Way before I even saw a American based animation, I was watching Marine Boy, Gigantor, Kimba and Astro Boy on our local TV networks.If you ever seen the whole series, you will see that the movie does an excellent job of matching the proper actors to the original anime characters. The story line, mixes and matches episodes from the original series and adds a twist that even caught me by surprise. The action was excellent to see the Mach 5 in action was great.

Having watched random episodes of the original anime, I was very skeptical as to how one could ever pull off making a live-action adaptation. The Wachowski brothers have pulled it off. The only way possible for this movie to be made was this over-the-top, campy romp through the race tracks. From beginning to end this film delivers a non-stop thrills. Even in the campy scenes that don't serve much plot purpose they held me in. Though it is very CG heavy and campy at times, there is some serious points where it does hit the dramatic mark and even had me emotional at one point. The end is obviously predictable but they do it so well and don't sell out to the really lame gags and rules of good guy - bad guy film-making. The acting was fantastic and they could not have gotten a better cast. This is great where kids can enjoy but also adults will as well with certain jokes and gags with a more mature sense to them I'd say. Old and new fans will not be disappointed.

It's a silly movie, but a very entertaining summer flick, far better than I expected, and far better than what you expect, if, of course, you're not expecting the next ""There Will Be Blood"". The visuals were gorgeous, the acting was the most natural of any of the Wachowski films, and the action was like kung-fu choreography with cars. Plus, I saw it in an IMAX theater, and while other movies, like Spider-Man 3, have not impressed me on the larger screen (just seemed like a big movie), this one actually played to the larger screens strengths. Well worth your time.",Speed Racer
421,mrjoshuajames-02381,Exactly what it should be,10,26 February 2021,"Speed Racer the movie is the original series incarnate. Race cars throwing snakes and beehives. Drivers with names like ""Speed"" and officers named ""Inspector Detector."" This is the acid trip anime with live actors. Excellent.",Speed Racer
422,mattw1cks,A Feast for the Eyes...,10,4 October 2008,"Im going to make this comment a short one, because words cant describe this film. I myself was slightly blown away. Not by the story line because lets be honest in many ways this is a kids movie, so the plot line is fairly obvious and the jokes are aimed at young ones. With all that aside however, I was riveted by the visual amazement of this film. Yes it is unrealistic, but in all the best ways possible. So many films we see today have amazing special effects and CGI but this film takes it to a whole new level, an array of colors I didn't even know existed opened by eyes from frame one and I don't think I blinked for the entirety of the film. If I had to give this film a rating out of 10 it would be 11, based purely on its wow factor. See it for yourself and give it a rating of whatever you want, but I can guarantee if you somehow don't enjoy this film, you'll agree is like nothing you've ever seen before. Please make more films like this, It makes imagination seem real, It made me feel like a child again.",Speed Racer
423,ryderspearmann,The Perfect Adapation,10,15 May 2018,"Speed Racer is a stunning achievement.Only those that know the original Speed Racer can really comprehend the difficulty of the task the Wachowskis took on. Their decision, clearly, was to being Speed Racer to the screen in a pure adaption... not a re-imagining. The artistic choices they needed to make to pull this off are inspired.The speeds are insane, the driving is nuts, the tracks are crazy and impossible!But that IS Speed Racer.Nine-year-olds ""got"" Speed Racer in 1968... they followed it perfectly in a way that only a blindingly fast nine-year-old sponge of a brain can. To the average boy, it is riveting. Nine-year-olds today will also ""get"" Speed Racer.True to the sounds, sights, characters and plots of the original, the 2008 Speed Racer hits it's target with LASER precision. It is bold in it's execution, being so true to the original that even the questionable elements of the 1968 version are retained, including the bizarre transitions and overall campy feeling.The film is woven tightly, providing the entire backstory and introducing all of the primary characters with considerable depth DURING the first race which serves as the opening to the film. By the end of this first race, we understand Speed perfectly. We know who he is and what drives him... and again, he is the Speed from 40 years ago. The other characters are true as well.Everything from emotions to camera angles are meticulously chosen to match the original. This is well demonstrated when Rex Racer talks over his shoulder, his back toward his father as he leaves forever in the tradition of the Japanese original. The tension and drama are constructed using the original techniques throughout.Speed Racer is the PERFECT live action rendition of anime... which to the uninitiated will seem bizarre and out of place. The Wachowskis have given new generations of kids a true gift... putting a beloved story on the big screen that might have otherwise been lost, and doing so in a painstakingly pure effort which will thrill little kids for many years to come.",Speed Racer

425,adamholsinger,Acid trip,8,4 December 2016,"This movie has it's flaws. I loved Speed Racer when I was little and our entire family saw it in theaters. I was still a kid and I loved it. It still does hold up well even though it has hiccups. Some of the editing and acting is flat, the backgrounds get uncomfortably bright, and the transitions are awkward. But, I have not seen any movie like it. I enjoy the racing scenes, and the action is pretty nice. Spritle and Chim-Chim are entertaining comic reliefs. The movie is light hearten. But, the camera work is not the best. The effects are hit and miss. It is going for it's own style, and it does work most of the time. One thing is for sure, this is my favorite trip movie.",Speed Racer
426,da-chou,Go Speed Go!,8,11 May 2008,"Wow. What a movie. I've wanted to see this for the longest time but after reading all the negative reviews and one comment in particular (""fuchsia throw-up""), my friends and I were hesitant. We were so hesitant that after we had bought tickets to Speed Racer, we decided to watch Harold and Kumar 2 instead (but that was packed) so we went back to Speed Racer. After the first 15 minutes of the movie, I thrilled that we stayed. This movie is just one heck of a ride. I'm never seen a Speed Racer episode or comic in my life and I don't watch/read(?) anime, but what an amazing visual experience. I don't even know how to explain it, except for insanely colorful. There's so much to be seen in every frame that I'm just thankful that glasses have been invented so I could take it all in. I don't even want to think about the technology and time that went into creating it.For those of you who are too adult for ""a movie that is colorful,"" there really is a wonderful storyline embedded within: about pursuing your dreams, placing your priorities, fighting for what's right, family values, sacrifice. Sure there are some cheesy lines and awkward dialogue, but this is a movie that will appeal to kids, adults, and the kids within the adults.I haven't had this much fun at the movies since Transformers. Worth every penny, this movie will blow you away-- 8/10",Speed Racer

428,theperfectdaniel,One of the best movies i've seen this year,10,9 May 2008,"I went into this movie wanting to see a live action version of a cheesy old school cartoon. What i got was a perfect rendition of that plus a damn fine movie.I read a review stating that the movie was all eye candy and very hollow. I disagree with the hollow part. Feather-weight, yes, but not hollow at all. It definitely has depth to it and i was moved several times during the movie and by the time the final race is in full swing, i found myself at the edge of my seat. I felt like a little kid again, watching a pulse pounding action sequence and wowed by it. And why? because i actually REALLY cared about the Racer family and what it was they were fighting for. What i got from this was a movie about family, self worth and ultimately: Sticking it to The Man.I am definitely watching this movie again at an IMAX theater for the visuals, but really, i'm seeing again because it was that good.May is shaping up to be a good month for movies. First Iron Man, then Speed Racer. Here's hoping Indy 4 doesn't suck.",Speed Racer
429,daninhj,BOOMM BOOM CAR ACTION,10,4 May 2019,"One of the best movies i've ever seen. Its up there. Very recommended either for children or for adults. First watched this movie when i was a kid, still got the same awe till now.",Speed Racer
430,yohami,Amazingly good,10,1 June 2008,"I think most haters didn't even see this one.I was dragged to this movie hating it because of its trailer and previews saying it was so bad, but the movie quickly turned everything around. This IS a cartoon, but with the character development you would expect in a good movie. Every character has its plot, the pieces come together smoothly, there are many, many adrenaline moments where you almost have to jump from your seat, and everything is presented in a way that makes you care about whats going on. Far, far from what I would have expected.Im voting 10 just to compensate the mess the haters are doing. but 8/10 is probably fair.",Speed Racer
431,ruandja-1,Awesome movie for the family!,10,11 May 2008,"All I can say is - DO NOT LISTEN TO THE IDIOT CRITICS! I was never a really big fan of the cartoon, but I thought this would be a great movie to take my 9 year old. I wasn't expecting much but I figured it had my boy Matthew Fox in it (playing Racer X) so I at least had that to look forward to. I have to say...I LOVED this movie. It was like nothing I'd ever experienced. The action was non-stop! I can't even explain the special effects...it was sort of like being in really colorful video game. I kind of felt like I was on an acid-trip at times - it was just really cool!!! The acting was surprisingly great for this type of family movie and the boy that plays Spridle actually stole the show. I would highly recommend this movie as a great way to send a couple of hours with your family. And don't wait for the DVD - you gotta see this one on the big screen!",Speed Racer
432,mikeignatz,A Whirlwind Ride With Sumptuous Visuals,10,1 June 2008,"I went in to this movie without huge expectations, never having seen any of the cartoons. I went simply because I thought the visuals would be nice based on the trailer and also because of the directors' track record (Matrix and V for Vendetta are two of my favorites). This movie absolutely blew me away. Everything about it was phenomenal. The presentation was brilliant and the performances were outstanding. I saw it in IMAX, and would definitely recommend that it be seen in IMAX if possible. I generally prefer to watch movies in IMAX if they are available, and this movie, to me, was the perfect example of what IMAX is capable of. Like another reviewer said, this movie's visuals far surpassed 300, and I was thoroughly impressed with 300 (which I also saw in IMAX and on HD-DVD).",Speed Racer
433,erikkjunk,Critics of this movie have obviously NEVER seen the cartoon!!,10,11 October 2008,"The most unfair judging of a movie I have ever witnessed. I saw an article the other day linking this movie to the top 20 flops ever created. Critics of this movie have obviously NEVER seen the cartoon. This movie was brilliant in terms of capturing the feel, the characters, the colors, the whole idea of the original cartoon. I was SHOCKED to see how this movie was panned. Obviously critics do not watch anime cartoons. If they had, they would have gotten the fact that this movie was a dead-on portrayal of the show. The casting, the cinematography, the editing. Awesome. If you are a fan of this show, you will love this movie. I have never seen a movie get more unfairly treated than this one. Wachowski brothers - hold your heads high. You did a brilliant job.",Speed Racer
434,ccodes-info,12/10 - That is my rating!!,10,23 June 2008,"This movie was bloody brilliant!! Yes, it was! Right from the very beginning, you know you are in for a blast! I have seen this movie been heavily criticized for the visual effects, but i say go for it!! What people don't seem to understand is that the visual effects seen in this movie are the only way to express the intensity of the races, especially the final race, where speed manages to finish the race first with the other two cars crashing in front of him!! The races are really exciting and puts you in the front seat of all the excitement!! The movie does seem colorful and may ""look"" like a movie for an 8 year old. Hey, i am 17 and i loved it! It's one of my all time favorites, actually! The acting was decent and the characters are definitely dedicated to the anime! Emile Hirsh does a great job portraying Speed Racer and is able to bring out the right emotions and so does Christina Ricci. Being a faithful fan of the anime, I think there is not a better movie which has been this faithful to the original material besides Batman Begins! Yes, This movie will definitely be under-rated especially for the visual effects, but people don't seem to accept ""different"" these days. Wachowski brothers gave us something different with Matrix and this Movie gives us something different too! Do not miss this movie! Go grab the DVD when it comes out, if you have missed it in the theaters. But i would definitely suggest you go see it in the cinemas!! Go Speed Racer!! Go!!",Speed Racer
435,milkyway2009,Awesome!,10,11 May 2008,"I heard a lot of negative things before going to see this film and so I was skeptical. But after seeing it, I've gotta say it's an awesome and ridiculously creative film! I've never seen any visuals like it, and despite the critics, I thought the non-linear story structure was a breath of fresh air from the over used storyline equations of typical Hollywood films. Right from the beginning, the film had me enthralled. Sure some parts are a bit awkward and cheesy, but it's supposed to be! The acting was great, the race scenes were awesome, and the film overall wasn't a pointless one. It made me feel like a happy kid again and had a good message. You better see it while it's in theaters! The cinematics are too good to miss on the big screen.",Speed Racer
436,kitten_red,brilliant!,7,25 May 2008,"Though i wouldn't normally watch films about cars / racing etc, I really enjoyed this! The younger characters (little brother and monkey) added light comic relief for the younger viewers, whilst the mild romantic relationship between speed and Trixie helped stop if from being all about the cars. And Patrick from 'coupling' made a cameo too! (""you were here last year, were'nt you?"" wink*) Brilliant special effects, it made me miss the old playstation racing games like ridge racer and wipeout. The family storyline and 'death' of older brother Rex also added a good twist along with the revenge on race fixing kept it entertaining without it becoming too much like a racing game montage.something for everyone! PS. And speed was as cute as ever! (some viewers may have recognised him from 'the girl next door')",Speed Racer
437,draybar,Very Underrated,9,24 December 2018,"Speed Racer, even without the aid of nostalgia lenses, remains an amazing movie to this very day. The visuals still hold up even a decade later, and the amount of heart and soul put into this movie shows. It's an entertaining ride from start to finish that never has a dull moment, making two hours just fly by like nothing. The Wachowskis did something great here, and it's certainly a favorite movie of mine.",Speed Racer
438,madMovieHatter,Ironman(2008)... now this!,10,8 May 2008,"Ironman(2008) was great fun for this spring, but I must say I got a lot more fun and excitement out of watching Speed Racer(2008). Both were great, only one had a bit more pizazz than the other.First of all, I've been looking forward to Speed Racer since my theater got the first teaser. I KNEW it was going to be exciting. It was right after I had watched Into The Wild(2007), which blew me away. I was mainly blown away with how affected I was with Emile Hirschs performance, hence, giving me the excitement for Speed Racer. I too was looking forward to it because I've been quite the fan of the Wachowski Brothers. I knew, after watching Speed Racers trailers, that they were up to something fresh, new and exciting once again. And AGAIN, I felt they did a wonderfully fun job! Great job guys!I heard and read a lot of discouragement about Speed Racer, but I never gave room for it. I listened to everyone about their doubts, but I remained faithful and excited, knowing that the WB's would do great.I signed up for my screening of Speed Racer ever since I saw the teaser and I definitely felt it was worth the wait! I had a ton of fun. I dressed up and everything for my screening. Indeed, I was that excited. Definitely Speed Racer fever. My eyes were constantly busy with all the color, the style of the editing, the action and the fun of the characters.I MUST congratulate the Wachoski Brothers and everyone involved with the production of this film for holding my interest during the awaiting and watching of SPEED RACER! THANK YOU GUYS! WAS AWESOME! I am very happy and beyond proud! I gave a solid Ten out of 10 for being so successful at holding my interest. I also solidly believe this is an EVERYBODY film. Well, not for the close-minded. Anyone of yous out there who decides to watch it this weekend, have fun!madMovieHatter! http://www.myspace.com/genievarose",Speed Racer
439,mcouthon,Sweet Mary Mother of Christ!,1,20 June 2008,"What a God awful movie! It was simply preposterous. All the comedy parts were ridiculous, all the ""touching"" parts were boring, and Matthew Fox!? WHY!? What was he thinking?""Matrix"" is by far my favorite movie of all times, and after watching ""V fro Vendetta"", I thought that the Wachowski brothers could do no wrong. Apparently I was the one that was wrong. I mean 6.8? ? Have you people watched the same crap I did? It is simply a shame, that a group of grown up people can sit in a room, work on this script, and not think ""Jesus! What are we doing!? This is madness!"".And the actors! Emile Hirsch - after ""Alpha Dog"", and especially ""Imaginary Heroes"" I though ""Finally - a bright young actor, who actually knows how to act, and not just looks good on screen"". But damn... what a disappointment.Susan Sarandon - no need to mention all the great movies she has done. A low point for her career as well. As is for John Goodman and Christina Ricci. So, to sum things up - this is hands down the worst movie I've ever seen. Without exaggeration.",Speed Racer
440,lucascerimeli,Incredibly Underrated,10,22 September 2018,"This movie is just, in my opinion, a work of art by the Wachowskis, I think it's a fairly good adaptation of the original series, which serves as an argument to some of the so called ""issues"" with the film, like the cheesy lines, because that's how it was in the original series, and personally, I don't mind it being cheesy or that it's ""made for children"", I find it a visually stunning and exciting experience for you to watch alone or with some friends. Just a great picture overall.",Speed Racer
441,nicib32,A good family movie,8,6 May 2008,"I have to say, it seems that those who hated it were obviously not doing their homework beforehand to know that SR is not supposed to be a thought-provoking film like The Matrix. It is based on a wonderfully simple cartoon with a simple message for kids. If anyone knows anything about cult fans, they want films to reflect the original medium as much as possible. Thus, if you go to a children's movie based on a child-friendly anime, expect it to be such and not some mind-blowing,challenging film. Especially these days, we need films like this one to take our minds off the usual violence and such found in so many other so-called family movies. Take it as it is, a great family flick for ALL ages to simply enjoy.",Speed Racer
442,reijunJoe,"If you don't like it, it's cause it wasn't meant for you.",10,14 May 2008,"Love it or hate (as seems to be the general case) this movie was undeniably masterfully written and shot. This film's primarily aimed at children with the intent of delivering a very clear message and set of core values. Values I for one fully condone and applaud the brothers for. Yet despite this being essentially a children's movie, they don't dumb it down at all; it's still an intelligent movie parents and fans can enjoy. They remain true to their form and the style fans of their work have come to expect.The Wachowskis also display a complete understanding for the feel and essence of the original Speed Racer cartoons. So much so, that if you can't even stomach watching an episode of the old Speed Racer, then it's very likely you won't enjoy this film. This movie is such a tribute to it's namesake that you'd think they watched it growing up. (perhaps they did)That's not to say you must be a fan of the old show to enjoy this (honestly, I never liked that anime). Nor does it mean you're not being able to enjoy it makes this movie any less a great piece of cinematography. The Wachowskis are able to get exactly what they want from their actors. This movie is void of any wasted scenes, as any good movie should be. Every visual, every dialogue, every aspect of the story is exactly what it's meant to be and it's there for a reason. There is no filler; it's all deliberate and effective in meeting it's goals.",Speed Racer
443,beth-276,Fun and Entertaining.,8,11 May 2008,"I saw this film in IMAX and it was a lot of fun. The special effects were great. The racing scenes were over the top, but well executed. I wasn't a fan of the original series as I never got the dialog or lack thereof. I was really surprised there wasn't more grunting and ""AWWWAH"" sounds, which is all I remember of the series. But I was with my best friend who was a big fan, he seemed to enjoy how they brought everything together.I wanted to go home and watch it on my home theater so I could catch everything that I missed because it went so fast. If you like high speed, action packed chase scenes and special effects that are worth viewing on the big screen, this is worth going to the theater for.",Speed Racer
