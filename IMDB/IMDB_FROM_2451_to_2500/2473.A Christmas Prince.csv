0,TheLittleSongbird,On the fence,5,30 November 2017,"Saw 'A Christmas Prince' with my flatmate on Netflix already in the Christmas spirit. After watching, my overall thoughts were that while 'A Christmas Prince' was watchable it left me torn as to what to make of it.On one view we have a few performances that make the grade. The best performance as the most well-rounded character by far (the only one to get development beyond cliché) comes from Honor Kneafsey, Emily starts off as a brat initially but grows as the character that one roots for the most. Rose McIver and Ben Lamb also give charming performances and have an easy going romantic chemistry. Alice Krige brings understated dignity to the queen.'A Christmas Prince' looks pretty good. The scenery is beautifully picturesque and has a really festive feel and the castle interiors and exteriors are enough to make one want to stay there. The photography is suitably slick. The music puts one into the festive mood and gives off a cosy nostalgia. Spotting the famous Christmas songs and carols is a delight and there is the serious temptation to sing along.There is some charm and genuine sweetness here while Amber and Emily's chemistry is very heartfelt. Didn't find myself bored either.However, the rest of the cast don't make much of an impression, most are bland. Then there is Theo Devaney and Emma Louise Saunders who play their stock villain characters with such broad hamminess that they make over-the-top villain characters in Christmas pantomimes more subtle in comparison.It is hard to deny too that 'A Christmas Prince', even for trying to take it for what it is, is riddled with clichés, non-stop predictability and contrivance. One has to suspend disbelief at how long it takes for the lie to be exposed, Amber constantly narrowly escaping being caught and how things are resolved far too quickly and easily.The script throughout is peppered with cheese (especially Simon and Sophia) and mawkish schmaltz, and of the characters although the leads are reasonably likable the only one to have any development is Emily. Simon and Sophia are plot-device material there for the sake of it and the way they're written and their antics jar tonally.Concluding, very torn on what to think. Part of me can't be too hard on it, but the faults are pretty glaring also. 5/10 Bethany Cox",A Christmas Prince
1,ComedyFan2010,A predictable movie that is still perfect for Christmas,7,27 November 2017,"The movie is extremely predictable. You just watch first 5 minutes and then you can tell what happens in the rest of the movie with 95% accuracy. The only thing you may miss out on is the royal sister with the disability. Everything else is written by a formula.That said the movie was still enjoyable. It is right for this time of the year. Simple, naive goodness, magical outcomes. This is what many of us like to watch for Christmas.It is hard to comment on acting because the actors are playing caricatures and unrealistic events. The only one worth mentioning in this case is Honor Kneafsey who is playing Princess Emily. She shows the real struggle of a little girl being upset by her disability and learning to deal with it by her nice fake tutor. This was very well done.Another big bonus is the beautiful magical Christmas scenery. The kind of movie you want to watch on a December night under a warm blanket with some Holiday treats. I would have rated it lower if it wasn't a Christmas movie. Otherwise it does it's job.",A Christmas Prince
2,cricketbat,What is happening to me? Do I like Hallmark-esque holiday movies now?,6,31 December 2018,"Maybe it's just because I'm a fan of Rose McIver, but I legitimately enjoyed A Christmas Prince. Despite all of its cliched moments and completely predictable storyline, I found myself engaged in the story. In fact, even though I fell asleep while watching it, I finished it the next morning because I wanted to. What is happening to me? Do I like Hallmark-esque holiday movies now?",A Christmas Prince
3,Irishchatter,Really good movie about an American commoner and an English prince,8,20 May 2018,"Before Meghan and Harry got hitched yesterday, I decided to watch this late Friday night and I honestly didn't care if it wasn't Christmas lol! I really enjoyed the story like we get to see an American reporter going undercover as the prince's sisters nanny and falls in love with the Prince of Moldova. I also liked the fact we have the ""bad guys"" such as the prince's ex and cousin wanting the crown just because of the fact, they are selfish (like any of us) and they found out the prince was adopted. It was good to see after all that drama and the fact, both Amber and Prince Richard finally got engaged in the end. I do have to agree this type of film is predictable but it's still enjoyable if it's sorta based on a real life Amercian woman and a prince!

4,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews....,5,13 December 2018,"A Christmas PrinceThe only people who really fall in love at Christmastime are those who are attracted to shopping mall Santas.There are exceptions of course, such as the royal rendezvous in this romantic comedy.With rumours Prince Richard (Ben Lamb) of Aldovia will abdicate the throne, American journalist Amber (Rose McIver) heads to the foreign nation to find out the truth. But when she is mistaken for the governess, Amber gets closer to the prince than expected. With a corrupt cousin ready to usurp, she must now use a document hidden inside a Christmas ornament to convince Richard that he's the rightful ruler.Lacking chemistry, this typical seasonal love story from Netflix also suffers from a deficiency of Christmas cheer. While the production values are higher than most Hallmark Christmas movies, the acting and script are pretty much on par.Furthermore, princes who date commoners spend their Christmas in the guest cottage.

5,lisafordeay,Surprisingly enjoyable,7,27 November 2018,"A Christmas Prince came out last year on Netflix and tells the story of a young woman named Amber Moore who is a journalist in New York City. She has to write an article and get dirt on a royal prince named Richard who is known to be a playboy. But when she arrives in the UK she gets mistaken for the prince's sister's tutor and plays along with it. But how long will she keep it up without falling in love with the prince?Overall I really liked this movie The premise is very predictable as I knew from the get go what was going to happen and I notice recently that the TV romance films are like Harry and Meghan Markle's life with the whole English prince falling for an American etc.
If you love The Prince and Me then you will love this film.The sequel is coming out this week so I will definitely check it out.",A Christmas Prince
6,DarkVulcan29,Charming film for the holidays,9,4 December 2017,"Amber(Rose Mclver, iZombie) eagerly wants to be big time reporter, finally gets her chance when asked to go to a press conference Aldovia in hopes to interview Prince Richard(Ben lamb) after that does not go to well, she sneaks in the palace, in hopes to come back with something, but soon is caught and gets mistaken for a tutor for Prince Richards younger sister named Emily. How will this all play out.Rose McIver gives a charmingly likable performance, not over the top funny. Ben Lamb is also great has King Richard, playing has someone who is very conflicted. The beautiful scenery becomes a character of it's own. And all the supporting cast do well also. The film is not a total comedy, and I also like the way the two main leads are not played annoyingly one noted. If you want a new fun holiday film, well give A Christmas Prince a look.",A Christmas Prince
7,robfollower,I am a sucker for romance this film fits the bill !!,7,24 December 2018,"In this delightful holiday romance, a New York journalist heads to Eastern Europe for Christmas to report on a prince who's about to be crowned king of his country. Campy but charming and thanks to Rose McIver the film is worth watching .",A Christmas Prince
8,Kamurai25,"""Another Royal Romance""",6,10 December 2020,"Decent watch, probably won't watch again, but can recommend.While it isn't anything truly special, it's a decent version of a ""journalist in disguise falls in love"" trope. Though the object of affection being a prince allows for resources that almost anyone wouldn't turn down.There certainly is a lot of production put into the movie to maintain the grand perception of royals, but the best part of the movie is the heart felt Christmas vibe of it.Unfortunately, this is mostly achieved through the secondary characters and them influencing the royal family.",A Christmas Prince
9,Christmas-Reviewer,A Few Surprises Keeps this barely interesting,5,3 March 2018,"Review Date 3/3/2018
PLEASE BEWARE OF SOME REVIEWERS THAT ONLY HAVE ONLY ONE REVIEW. I HAVE OVER 400 REVIEWS OF ""CHRISTMAS RELATED FILMS & SPECIALS"" WHEN ITS A POSITIVE THERE IS A GOOD CHANCE THEY WERE INVOLVED WITH THE PRODUCTION. NOW I HAVE NO AGENDA! I REVIEW MOVIES & SPECIALS AS A WAY TO KEEP TRACK OF WHAT I HAVE SEEN! I HAVE DISCOVERED MANY GEMS IN MY QUEST TO SEE AS MANY "" C H R I S T M A S "" MOVIES AS I CAN.Now Someone keeps reporting my reviews. I guess they are jealous because I do tell the truth. I want to point out that I never make snide remarks about actors weight or real life sexual orientation. If there acting is terrible or limited ""I talk about that"". If a story is bad ""I will mention that"" So why am I being ""picked on""? IMDB? When one of my reviews gets deleted IMDB will not even tell me what someone found offensive. Well on to this review.In this film a young journalist, Amber Moore, is sent to the foreign nation of Aldovia to cover a press conference regarding the crown prince Richard, who is set to take the throne following his father's recent death. Richard is alleged to be an irresponsible playboy and is also rumored to be planning to abdicate. Once she does arrive Amber is soon mistaken for the new tutor of the young princess, Emily, and takes the opportunity to go undercover to investigate the rumors of abdication.She uncovers many things that can easily sell a million newspapers and make her career. However she basically must sell her soul to do so. Pretty filming locations helps keeping this movie interesting. The plot is 85% predictable. Not a bad film in term of performances. It won't insult your intelligence it jusy may bore you from time to time.",A Christmas Prince

11,bettycjung,A nice royal romance movie for our time,7,11 June 2018,"6/6/18. I really liked this movie about a modern day romance between a prince and a journalist looking for a story. The movie did a good job of perpetuating our ideas of what a monarchy would be like in our day and age. It humanizes the reluctant heir apparent with a sensibility that is totally lacking in the pretender to the throne and the woman who is a bit too interested in having a crown on her head. Nice ending. Heard there's a sequel to this movie, which would be nice.",A Christmas Prince
12,rebekahrox,Meh.,7,19 December 2017,"This might as well be a Hallmark Movie of no particular note. I almost suspect it is kind of a gentle spoof of all the Hallmark Christmas move cliches. Snowball fight, hero falling on heroine in the snow, Reserved serious mother/queen unbending, child in the house who starts out as a spoiled brat but turns into an ally of our heroine. I liked the two main leads all right and did enjoy seeing Alice Krige. Maybe I am giving Netflix too much credit and it's just another in a long line of mediocre Christmas romances. It has no reason to exist.",A Christmas Prince
13,doctorsmoothlove,Watch another prince movie.,4,12 December 2019,"If you visited CNN in December of 2019, you may have read an article about ""A Christmas Prince"" and it's two seuqels (as of the time of this review). The actors were said to understand the ridiculousness of the franchise. And how ridiculous it is! This is a movie where a rookie gossip magazine reporter visits a country whose king has recently died to report on its ne'erdowell prince or so the world says. I disagree that the actors ""know"" about the ridiculousness of it. The film comes off as a Christmas version of any other film featuring an ordinary woman who becomes the object of affection of a prince.The reporter, Amber, is played by Rose McIver, a funny entertainer from New Zealand. You may recognize her from iZombie. She doesn't seem to have the ability to adapt to the sensitivity the part seems to call for. You get the impression that the actress can't portray the character with the sensitivity the intended audience would like. It reminds me of Kristen Stewart in Twilight. If you are aware of Kristen's real life personality that film seems even worse than it really is. These kinds of films need a performance like Reese Witherspoon's in ""Legally Blonde,"" that's just under being over the top.Amber becomes a tutor for the Prince's kid sister. The ruse doesn't last long and the sister will let Amber stay if she keeps being entertaining. Eventually the prince falls in love with her.. For some reason? I'm not sure what he finds appealing about her other than the script's mandate. There are some beautiful shots of the castle and the hill where the family goes sledding. The budget was high enough to film in a real castle with real snow.I wasn't fond of ""A Christmas Prince."" The film is neither cheesy enough to be camp or a good love story. The CNN article I believe is a disguised advertisement.",A Christmas Prince
14,Magow-Intermean,A Christmas Prince Review,6,1 December 2017,"In A Christmas PRINCE, the European Kingdom of Aldovia, still mourning the death of its beloved king, is expecting an important decision from their young heir-in-waiting. Will Prince Richard assume his father's throne, or will he choose to remain the playboy and ne'er do well he seems to be? Richard's decision is to be announced at the annual Christmas Eve ball. Amber a fledgling American magazine journalist who has never covered such an event on her own, is overjoyed when she's assigned the Aldovian story. Unfortunately, when Amber arrives at the palace she learns that reporters have been banned from the proceedings. Only a chance case of mistaken identity gets Amber into the family's chambers. Substituting a little deceit for honesty, Amber takes advantage of the housekeeper's assumption that she is the new tutor to Richard's little sister, Princess Emily (Honor Kneafsky). Very quickly, Richard and Amber connect, are wary of one another, but soon find much in common, especially their concern for Emily, who is wheelchair-bound. It takes an old girlfriend, a scheming would-be successor to the throne, and Richard's discovery that Amber isn't exactly who she says she is, to complicate the story before bringing it to its anticipated conclusion. Parents need to know that A Christmas Prince is a holiday fairy tale with a picturesque mythical mountain kingdom, Christmas violins, a shimmering castle ball, and horses prancing through the snow. A smart and beautiful but mildly dishonest heroine and a handsome prince complete the picture. It's a familiar story, but has enough charm and even a few twists to add a little bit of suspense. Other than a brief moment with a menacing wolf and a fall from a horse, there's no jeopardy and no real suspense. The movie is filled with wholesome messages about staying true to oneself and listening to your heart. Fine holiday viewing for fans who like their happy endings just around the palace corner.On DVD or streaming: November 13, 2017 Cast: Rose McIver, Ben Lamb, Alice Krige Director: Alex Zamm Studio: Netflix Genre: Romance Run time: 91 minutes MPAA rating: NR",A Christmas Prince
15,eberkerbatur,don't waste your time!!!!!,3,29 January 2019,"We wanted to watch a Christmas movie and this movie appeared.
At first glance, it seems to be an amateur film, but at least we said we'd be laughing but I can say the classic netflix family movie is a ridiculous, boring and freaky amateur movie so don't watch this movie.I would like to say additionally at the movie shown us as the palace of the kingdom in Romania(Peles Castle)I went the last year is beatiful and amazing place,a place where I really think everyone should go and see.
We enjoyed watching the movie we went to the palace, but the movie was definitely not beautiful.",A Christmas Prince
16,Dunham16,Third and weakest in the series of the American girl courted by a Prince,3,4 December 2017,"This follws A PRINCESS FOR Christmas and A PRINCE FOR Christmas. The carols chosen seem stilted and not what would be sung in the European country in which the fictitious storyline is set. The acting is second class as is the storyboard and in the end merely for those who want more of this genre not those who want a well written, performed and edited cut. Little of interest less of outstanding cinematography. Best seeing hte first two or the other Hallmark Chistmas move of the season misleadingly billed as The Christmas Prince.",A Christmas Prince
17,mistoppi,Yuck,3,1 December 2017,"I hate these kind of movies. The structure of the story is always similar, and you can see how the story is going to go from a mile away. It's an easy movie to watch, I guess there's nothing more to it. And yes, I admit, at one point I was almost excited to see how this was going to go, but that feeling lasted for two minutes, and that was that.The only thing I liked in this movie is the actress Rose McIver, yet her performance wasn't as great as I had hoped. The only one giving this movie a little charm was Honor Kneafsey as princess Emily. Everyone else was just plain bland and awful. So yeah, if you want an easy movie to watch over the holidays, this is perfect for that, but honestly... Nothing special about this movie. absolutely nothing. It's boring, bland, and I feel like I've seen it million times before. And I have no idea why Christmas even is a theme here, it could've been done without that.",A Christmas Prince
18,MIssM19,Perfect for the holidays.,9,18 November 2017,"This movie was such a pleasure to watch! Have you seen any Hallmark movie? I was expecting something like that, and even though it is the same type of movie, at the same time it wasn't at all! (But I do think they used the same location as one of the royal/Christmas movies)The story was great. There were a few twist that were predictable but there were even more that were unexpected! So no complaining about the plot. The characters were great. Rose McIver never disappoints me. And the rest of the cast did a good job as well.There was some kind of chemistry between the main characters. And there were a few unrealistic moments, but the rest of the story and elements of the movie were great. Thank you Netflix!If you enjoy romantic movies and you have access to the movie you should definitely watch it, it's perfect for the holidays.",A Christmas Prince
19,jp281995,Enjoyable,7,28 November 2018,"Lately I've been in the mood for cheesy rom coms on Netflix.The plot may be predictable, but this movie is meant to be enjoyed, especially on Christmas. I find the story funny, charming, cute. It's better than The Princess Switch, also by Netflix. The only real problem is that there wasn't enough time for the Prince and the journalist to make a connection. Anyway it is still very entertaining.",A Christmas Prince
20,patrickfilbeck,Ruined by the modern times,3,12 November 2021,"This Christmas romance is kitschy and sometimes a little flat, but that wouldn't matter, after all, Christmas films are often very focused sentimental films. Why this film fails here with all its kitschiness is the reason that modern times bring with it. A cold picture, too much device focusing - the vulture knows why cell phones always have an unmistakable role to play in today's films - and hardly any atmosphere spoils this film. Of course there is one or the other moment that implements the thought that things could go up from here, but this hope is actually consistently disappointed.",A Christmas Prince

24,Benslie,Perfect for people who like RomComs,6,17 December 2018,"First of all, the acting in this film isn't that bad. You can easily tell that everybody is trying their hardest to portray these characters. Some of them came across as real-life people while others just felt like charctercharacterss in a movie. This could mainly be pointed to the writing in this film. Some of the lines in this film were just hilariously bad and cringy and I would give examples but I already forgot them. But I do have to say the scenery was stunning and the production on this was well done. Each set and costume looked perfect for each scene. The costumes fit each character and showed a bit more into their personality. For example, Richard's outifts made him look like royalty but at the same time, a normal guy because that's what he wants to be. This film had lots of pacing issues. From beginning to end it didn't feel like that was the speed it should be going at. The beginning felt slow while the ending felt to fast. The creators of the film might have thought they had a longer film and then realized they only had a one hour and thirty-two-minute film so they had to quickly resolve the film. The last thing I want to talk about is the relationship in this film. It's not believable or relatable. I know it shouldn't be relatable seeing how it is about a journalist falling in love with a prince but the writers still should make it so some people can relate to at least one of them. And it isn't believable because it seems too rushed. Throughout the entire film, they are hardly around each other and then all of a sudden he just loves her. There is no explanation why just little subtle hints. In the end, A Christmas Prince is perfect for people who like RomComs but for others not so much.",A Christmas Prince
25,nnom,Full disclosure...,8,14 September 2019,"....it's schmaltzy...it's over the top schmaltzy....but sometimes, you're in the mood for that, ya know?
Rose McIver, granted not a stellar actress but not average or bad either, has a quality like a young Julia Roberts. She's just plain likeable...you wanna watch her, why do you think iZombie lasted as long as it did?
Some of the acting, sure, leaves a LOT to be desired...but overall, if you're in the mood for schmaltz, you could do worse.",A Christmas Prince
26,sherilcarey,great casting,8,9 October 2021,"These sorts of lower budget or made for tv films do not have a reputation for being the best production values or the best writing and I acknowledge there are a few things here I could pick at. However I really enjoyed this quite a bit. And I especially want to compliment the choices in casting for most of the parts, especially the queen and the main character. There were others that were just as good or nearly as good, so that I feel a bit bad about only mentioning those two. Perhaps I can also give honorable mention to the Prince and his little sister. If you are ever into these types of films, I do recommend this one.Oh and it was clean, so three cheers for that! I do get so tired of all the low caliber and all the bad side effects to films that come from it!",A Christmas Prince
27,ssra_25,"Charming and relaxing (hey, it's a Christmas movie after all)",9,11 January 2019,"As the title says, it's charming and relaxing. Why? Well, because it has romance, a bit of intrigue, a pretty girl, beautiful landscapes from the Carpathian mountains and a beautiful castle, also located in the Carpathian mountains.Aside from the occasional bad acting (mostly done by secondary characters), I really have nothing bad to say about this movie. It's a Christmas movie, not a blockbuster, not drama looking to win the Oscar, so I'm reviewing it at such.For a Christmas movie it's great, so give it a shot. :)",A Christmas Prince

31,ava792,Disaster,4,2 April 2020,Had so much expectation. But these actors know how to ruin things. The movie could have been so good but the dialogues and the acting messed it all up.

32,vriddheeg,watch it today,6,19 November 2017,"The movie starts off showing a lot of Christmas decor around and it is amazing to watch, especially if you are from a place that has no snow and lights up, you are gonna love the beginning itself.",A Christmas Prince
33,Christina-Q,"Entertaining movie, but offers nothing new",6,24 November 2018,"A reporter goes undercover to the royal castle and meets the prince, and you know what happens then. ;)This, too, has most of the Christmas/Royal movie cliches, but for some reason it still manages to be entertaining and not a snooze fest. It is nothing compared to Princess diaries, but it is not the worst princess/prince movie I have seen.I know these type of movies aren't supposed to be realistic. But for some reason it really bothered me how easily the reporter got in to the palace. It was just too easy. Like seriously the lack of security was just...no, and the way the people in the castle ""knew"" that she was the new teacher was just sooo off. No ID's asked, no nothing.
And the other thing was that how easily the reporter and princess Emily start to get along all of the sudden is just so annoying and comes really out of the blue, like bam, now we are best friends. Ugh.The movie has its problems (and there are many), and at some points I thought I stop watching it, but I really like Rose McIver, so for her, I watched this. She is cute and a good (not great) actress, and I liked her at iZombie. She did good job in here too and I think i will watch the sequel, when it comes to Netflix.",A Christmas Prince

It is the same castle used in the dreadful A Princess for Christmas but used much better here. It has the cute and plucky heroine, the handsome, but misunderstood King to be and the required SBF and SGBFs, Melissa and Andy. This is the attempt at inclusion and diversity. They could have made them more dimensional but sadly, they are too cliche, honestly. The acting is okay, the costumes are okay but it's set apart because the actors seem relaxed and enjoying themselves. Nice to see veteran actors Alice Krige and Sarah Douglas.",A Christmas Prince
37,mrturk182,"I Mean, What Can You Expect?",6,2 December 2017,"Now when it comes to Christmas movies, the normal viewer will likely watch a theatrical release from years ago that are either classics or contemporary hits or even a current Christmas movie that's out and receiving a lot of buzz. They may also be likely to watch a classic Christmas special that you grew up on because it gets you into the best holiday spirit. And then, more often than not, they may be likely to watch original made-for-television Christmas movies that are too sanitized to have any substance to it, especially considering the channels that air these Christmas movies (in this case, Hallmark and Lifetime instantly come to mind). When you look at the posters, the previews, and even the synopsis for A Christmas Prince, you're quick to assume that it falls into that category. And while you're right, you're also quick to assume that it's from Hallmark Channel, Lifetime, or Freeform's 25 Days of Christmas lineup. But it's not. This is a Netflix original starring Rose McIver (iZombie) as Amber, a reporter from New York who gets called on an assignment to do a cover story on Richard, an Aldovian prince preparing to take the throne after his father's passing. Upon arrival, she finds herself in a forced position to keep her mission a secret once she gets mistaken as a tutor for his disabled sister, Emily.I don't really watch these made-for-television Christmas movies in this kind of vein, but I've noticed my family watch enough of these around this time of year to understand the formula. And when I watched this movie, my expectations were mostly met. It's one of the most basic sanitized contemporary made-for-television movies that lie on the romance/comedy/Christmas spectrum, despite the fact that this one doesn't have a lot to do with the Christmas holiday. It's just a Christmas movie by default, because it takes place during that holiday. It pretty much lacks the excitement, and most of the focus is on Amber's mission and eventual relationship with Prince Richard.Now, what does work for this movie is some of the acting. I like Rose McIver as an actress, and her performance here is mostly solid. Another pleasant surprise was the performance of Honor Kneafsey as Emily. She puts up a wall between her and Amber at first, but she quickly opens up and becomes her partner while Amber's in Aldovia. I liked seeing her character open up and allow me to learn more about herself. We don't get a lot of her character throughout most of the movie, but when we do see her, she steals the scene. This movie also did good with introducing most of the twists and turns. We eventually see Amber learn that Prince Richard has a secret of his own that could compromise his ability to become the King of Aldovia, even though he hints that he may not be 100% ready to have all that responsibility in his heart.I feel like I need to sound off on what worked against the movie, but in all honesty, it's too basic of a made-for-television romantic-comedy styled Christmas movie to really have a major flaw. As such, A Christmas Prince is a decent holiday flick. It doesn't do too much in its favor, but it doesn't do too much against it as well. It's formulaic, but it at least follows the formula.Score: 57/100Recommendation: If you're curious enough to find something Christmas-themed Netflix title other than a fireplace on an endless loop.",A Christmas Prince
38,Mlle_Chouette,Could be better,5,5 March 2018,"I watched this movie a couple a weeks ago and in general I like this sort of movies, some cheesy and sweet stuff when you want to relax and get away from the fuss. Of course we don't want this kind of movies wondering how it ends, as they are predictable and similar, but it doesn't matter. But even a simple plot shouldn't have so many holes. I mean the prince is called 'playboy' with absolutely no reason for that, the girl walks around the castle and a butler thinks she's a tutor only because she's american even if the real tutor has to arrive two weeks later, even if there should have been a big press conference a few minutes before. And obviously no one even asks her documents or else. I am no specialist in the area but I also suspect that if an employee breaks a couple of expensive things in the house, not everyone will be OK with it. They barely talked two times and already it's like 'true love' and marriage. I mean WHAT? I'm not expecting a super realistic movie but even for me it was too much.Also as someone mentioned it in previous review: she actually considered publish a secret information that she kinda stole. How am I supposed to sympathy her??All in all, the movie is not bad, it can go for a chick flick night or if you have a soft spot for these 'hallmark-style' movies, but nevetheless personally for me it didn't have a sweet after-taste when you're like 'awww'. Maybe even on the contrary.",A Christmas Prince
39,kamille,The Scenery is Lovely,7,20 November 2021,"I expected a formulaic story and was not disappointed; if there are any original Christmas flicks out there I haven't come across them. It's girl meets boy, quickie romance ensues, secret comes out, couple splits, couple reunites, happy ending. As predictable as April rain.It was a nice way to pass the time though, and the scenery is a delight to see. My biggest problem with this movie is that it lacks the aura of romance. Yes, you heard that right. While the premise is a romance, the performance is devoid of emotion. I never, at any time, felt any kind of love or connection between the two main characters. I couldn't have cared less about their union. They might as well have been kissing cardboard for all the depth they portrayed.The young, wheel-chair bound princess, however, was believable and relatable. She was the heart of the story.Clearly, the main actors were chosen for their bone structure and not for their emoting skills. Try using soap opera actors next time.. now those thespians really know how to exude passion!",A Christmas Prince
40,Multipleh,Prince Uncharming,1,27 December 2017,"Let's forget about the corny plot. Of course, a movie titled ""A Christmas Prince"" can't be that intriguing as in terms of the storyline. Therefore, one could conclude that the charm of the leads could help propel the film or at least make it consumable to the Netflix audience-of course it's not the case here! The main problem seems to be the prince. Ben Lamb has absolutely no charm on screen. Makes you wonder how he got this lofty role as the prince and Rose McIver is no Reese Witherspoon. The pairing of McIver and Lamb had no chemistry. The prince is too much of a wimp and the journalist is rather dull. Overall, a very disappointing movie.",A Christmas Prince

JUST like this MOVIE!! #richgirlsarepeopletoo!!they go outside where the prince has shaved his rude beard and the three of them bond by shooting an arrow through a window!! and our main character seems like she's a bit smitten with him, at least until you remember that she said earlier that he is not her type!!so the main character keeps snooping around the castle and building her bond with the princess and being awkward but cute and then one day she finds the prince playing a christmas song on the piano and it shows how sensitive he is!! he tells her that music is the food of the soul!! ummmm you know what i think is the food of the soul?? #MOMMYJUICE!!then they have a dinner party and lady sofia shows up and from the start it looks like she has some kind of history with the prince!! she gives him a heart-shaped ornament to put on the tree and tells him to ""be careful with it,"" and I went ""awwwwww"" because it was like she was telling him to be careful with her heart!! from that moment on i was #teamsofia!! but my husband was shipping the main character and the prince and my oldest daughter was shipping the main character's two friends back home and my youngest daughter was shipping the princess and the butler!! #iwillgodownwiththisship!!it does get a little bit scary when the main character follows the prince on horseback into the woods and gets lost!! i guess that aldovian snow doesn't keep tracks for more than a second or two because she isn't able to follow her horse's tracks back home after it throws her off its back and she wanders around until dark when a wolf shows up!! i always thought that wolves travel in packs but i guess not in aldovia!! it really does seem like an interesting country!! so the prince shows up and frightens the wolf away and then he takes the main character to a nearby cabin for the night and they almost do something that isn't appropriate for children!! but fortunately they don't!! #truespiritofchristmasbut it DOES turn out that the prince has been adopted and isn't the true heir to the throne and also his evil cousin and sofia snoop around and find out that the main character isn't who she says she is either!! it gets really dramatic!! when the prince is going to be crowned, they reveal that she is a journalist and that he is adopted in front of everyone in a really shocking way!! All of a sudden it looks like there might not be a christmas after all!!but fortunately there still IS a christmas and i promise you it will warm your heart!! okay!!

43,mischievouslyradiant,Cute and heartwarming,10,23 November 2017,"The only other movie I saw with a mix of Christmas and royalty is ""A Princess for Christmas,"" starring Katie McGrath and Sam Heughan, which I also recommend.This Netflix movie might be ""predictable"" and ""cliche,"" but it doesn't matter, if you enjoy these types of romance movies. And I'll never be prepared to see the main character almost get caught and then become exposed in the end. For example, early in the film, Amber, played by Rose McIver, took pictures with her iPhone in plain sight; it's moments like that, that I worry so much, that I kept turning off the app to cool myself off. And the video chats with her friends? Someone could've been listening in. Messaging would've been discreet.I really like Emily and Amber's relationship. You see that Emily is not really the brat from her initial appearance. And I love Richard and Emily's relationship as brother and sister; it's nice seeing siblings on TV who care about each other always. I grew up watching Disney, and while it's entertaining, literally every show has siblings who are always at each other's throats, only sometimes showing that they truly care about each other.I like Richard a lot. At first, I thought it'd be like ""A Prince and Me,"" where the prince was a playboy. But here, Richard isn't actually a playboy. He's decent, but human, not perfect, but he really shines through his kindness. When he learns who Amber is, I expected him to blow up at Amber for her deceit, but he wasn't mean about it. He was upset. He felt so betrayed. The same with his mother - he simply wanted answers, he didn't blow up at her.I think these are the main reasons why I liked this movie. I feel there's more to tell, but I'm not sure I can elaborate. It's just ... really great.",A Christmas Prince

45,romanticomedies,YES,9,24 December 2018,A great feel good Christmas movie where she tries to get ahead in her career and falls for the prince. It's insanely cliche but nice to watch this time of year. Very sentimental and right on the part for both lead actors.

47,dr_shred,Liked the movie but there's a better one.,8,27 December 2017,"Liked the movie but there's better one.I finally watched the, by now, cult phenomenon ""A Christmas Prince""
on Netflix. It's not bad and I'm a big fan of Rose McGiver,
a.k.a Liv Moore on iZombie, so I give it a Thumbs Up.However, I like others, was struck by the similarities with
""A Princess for Christmas"", which is a superior movie if for
nothing else that is does have a Christmas theme, not like
""A Christmas Prince"", which purports to be a Christmas movie,
but is like so many other movies which are simply romance
or dramatic films which occur during Christmas.A case in point is ""It's a Wonderful Life"" which isn't really
about Christmas at all.Here is my list of similarities of the two films:* Young woman (YW) becomes involved with a royal family
* Same castle: Peles Castle, Stirbei Castle, the Bragadiru
Palace, Romania
* Snowy
* Horses galloping in the snow
* Misunderstood prince (MP) with parent issues
* There's been a death in YW's and MP's families
* MP does archery (a family tradition) outside on one of the
the castle walkways
* MP shows young relative how to use the bow & arrow
* An old Xmas tree ornament is found with deep family
significance and parent of MP hangs it on the tree
* Snooty upper-class woman (Lady Sophia, SLS), the MP's ex
girlfriend wants the MP to marry her
""We both know this isn't going to work""
* Outdoor scene in the local village. Orphans are involved.
* The MP's family plans a Christmas ball (CB)
* Jealous SLS is suspicious of YW
* MP's mother's imperious heart melts at YW's warmth
* YW has a misunderstanding of MP's intentions (kissing SLS)
* YW gets a new dress and makeover for the CB
* YW comes down the ballroom steps in her glorious gown at the CB
* YW's deception is revealed. She flees to the airport
* YW is rescued, agrees to marry MP",A Christmas Prince

Rose McIver is just enough 'innocent looking' to make this work. Nicest performance by Honor Kneafsey as the handicapped princess, gaining confidence from her non-teacher. Of course the bad guy and girl are caricatures.

What happened here I do not know, after watching the movie I am left with the impression that this was made in a hurry.The base story line is actually ok and had potential, this is a light feel good romantic Christmas story, so the basic story is exactly what we who love this type of movies are looking for.
Unfortunately, the film is ruined by bad acting, over caricatured characters, bad writing and poor dialog, also bad/cheap quality in the production. For example, seeing pictures of the newspapers web sites, they don't even look like real web pages, and that should not be a hard thing to make.I think children probably will like this, with the over simplification and over characterizing that often helps children understanding the story, for us adults it is painful to watch.
The look of the castle in Christmas lights is stunning and beautiful.
The casting of actors Ben Lamb as the Prince and Alice Krige as the Queen is a good match, but they can only do so much with the lines they have been given.Summary: If only Netflix had spent some more time in developing the dialog and story and looked for better actors this could have been great.",A Christmas Prince

61,Janice257,Couldn't get into it,2,2 December 2018,"I like the main actress for her work on iZombie...but I was so distracted by her seeming to try to act younger than she looks in this movie that I couldn't get behind her as the main love interest. Sounds superficial I know, but it actually has nothing to do with her age, just the way that she acted in this role/ the condition of her skin and hair (looking like she just got out of bed/ has had too much sun/ too many die jobs/ not enough sunscreen or hair conditioner).Along the same lines, the prince was so BLAH that I couldn't see the appeal. It just felt very forced on the viewer to assume that we would want to be with him because he is a ""bad boy"" prince...but he had such a boring personality and was so bland looking. He's no Harry lol.As for the movie itself, it was just TOO cheesy. Kind of rushed and very predictable. I know that most of these movies don't have a crazy shocking twist at the end (you assume most people will die in a horror movie, and the main two characters in a love story will end up together), but this was just over the top. I really wanted to like it because I've been trying to binge watch cheesy Christmas movies.

Since my viewing experience was influenced by my current emotions, I decided to watch it again, to give it a fair chance. I still didn't really like this movie. It took a few ideas from various areas of Disney (i.e. The Princess Diaries, Beauty and the Beast, Enchanted) and even then the story was rather weak. The settings are beautiful, and the costumes are great too, however that doesn't save this movie from being average at best. With every character a cliché, every joke being unoriginal and predictable (rather like the main story), and a leading actress who seems to be trying way to hard to be Reese Witherspoon, I couldn't find myself liking this movie.

I don't mean that in an insulting fashion. This movie is the food equivalent of cotton candy. Sweet but without any substance.It's a standard boy meets girl but girl is hiding something plot (Never Been Kissed, How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days), with the the male love interest being a Prince.Before going in I could have written all the plot beats on a paper and gotten them largely on the nose. The difference is she isn't just keeping a secret from him she's stalking him. She's a reporter trying to get a scoop on the Prince who has an unearned 'Playboy' title (with no real reason given).The reporter goes undercover as the tutor for the Prince's younger sister and within minutes of her arrival and introduction she's destroyed a million dollar Ming vase. For reasons I can't fathom she's allowed to stay around (days later she ruins a painting that looks to be several hundred years old).As the movie progresses, with time being difficult to track, the Prince is shown to be Absolutely Perfect. The lead actress is proven to be an unethical piece of trash but played by a very charming actress! She ends up coming across documents that prove the Prince is adopted, and thus not eligible for the crown. She agonizes over reporting this and actually does tell 2 friends back at her magazine. I'm sorry but she's lost all moral ground at this point and is now A Bad Person. Spying on and stalking the Prince are already Bad Things, but to steal documents that she found by chance and then even for a second considering releasing them?Honestly when everything played out (the reveal, the evil cousin because there is always one of those, trying to take the crown) and she saves the day because for some reason the previous king can make up new laws without anyone ever finding out about them. She goes home all sad like.Then of course the 100% expected thing happens. The Prince, now King, shows up in New York and proposes to her. Because of course he does.The movie genuinely feels as if minimal effort went into making it. It was very paint by numbers. Nothing unique or interesting happens that deviates from what one would expect.So if you're looking for some Christmas movie pap, go see it!Amber should have been thrown in jail though.",A Christmas Prince

The cast is wonderful--Honor Kneafsey is a very good child star! Both leads (Ben Lamb and Roes McIver) are great and the story is special for this time of year. Sure hope that there will be at least one sequel! There are several that could be made.",A Christmas Prince
81,marcylaigne,Very Special movie,9,31 December 2017,"This movie has excellent chemistry between the leads. Ben Lamb as the prince plays his part so well --he is charming, well-spoken (who can't fall for that British accent) and has a well modulated voice. Rose McIver is perfect as the interloping reporter who shows a real person to the prince! Honor Kneafsey is the right mix of little princess and child growing up. The Queen is so believable as mother as well as Queen. Please, please make at least one sequel Netflix! I can think of several possible storylines. The movie setting is beautiful, snow is a perfect backdrop for this movie. The castle makes one want to hurry to Europe! Moving from New York to Aldovia is an easy choice! A true feel good movie!",A Christmas Prince
82,jdjbaxter,Favorite Christmas romance!,10,6 December 2018,I have watched soooo many hallmark movies and this one just warmed my heart and I didn't stop smiling the whole movie! I normally think eh you'll know the ending befor it starts but I didn't even care with this one!,A Christmas Prince
83,obelga,O filme é até legal....,7,3 October 2020,"Como um bom clichê natalino, o filme tem alto e baixos, a dublagem até que ficou boa, um bom filme pra assistir em um sábado à noite",A Christmas Prince
84,svarcbergaguna,The plot was messed up,5,31 October 2021,"At first the film was funny and I liked it, but than everything started. I liked how the film was filmed and also the chemistry was good. However the plot was horrible. At the middle of the film I just wanted to stop watching.",A Christmas Prince
85,andrea_b_f,Not good. Not unless you are a moron,2,5 December 2017,"The two stars represent the fact that this film makes for a fantastic drinking game this festive season. Take a drink every time:You see something incredibly clichéd You can see plot points and ""twists"" coming from 10,000 miles awayYou find yourself wondering, ""if this is meant to be in mainland Europe, why do they speak like British aristocracy?""The horrible dialogue makes you cringe and die a little insideI guarantee you will be off your trolley in the first half-hour.Also, don't be fooled by these reviews. The volume of people giving it 10 stars seemed mighty suspicious. And indeed, the vast majority of them come from people who joined this month, specifically to review this one film...",A Christmas Prince
86,overvolume,Too many similarities...,6,23 November 2017,"First, I must say I am very confused by this movie... WAY too many scenes were WAY to similar to scenes in the movie ""A princess for Christmas"", even though the main plot differed a bit. I mean, even the titles are too similar for it to be a coincidence, in my opinion. They even used the SAME castle building for the royal palace! Is this satire of Hallmark movies? Because if it's not I think the similarities are a little too many for it to be completely okay.Apart from those thoughts it was an okay movie to watch before bed on a Thursday night, if you like movies about royalty/commoner. That's all I can say about that.",A Christmas Prince
87,trishiorfino,Cream of the Hallmark xmas romance crop,8,24 October 2021,"You know what, for this type of movie, it's really pretty good. The plot gets somewhat interesting. Much better than the usual Hallmark xmas movie typically is.",A Christmas Prince
88,lup_alb_09,Meh.,4,18 December 2018,"I'm the only one that thinks it has too many ideas stolen from 'The beautician and the beast'?This movie is light, like... very light, easy to watch for everybody but after u wached it, you forget about it, atleast you'll wish to.",A Christmas Prince
89,missvdoe,not worth watching,1,15 December 2018,"I usually don't write reviews but this time I really have to.I'm pretty serious about movies in general when it comes to their quality regarding filmmaking, character development and storyline. But I can't deny that I do consume the one or the other chick flick or 18th century schmaltz. So I am perfectly able to pull something out of a movie like this, without considering it as bad.This one though, has been really hard to watch.I know Rose McIver (Amber) from iZombie, a show that felt very fresh and exhilarating when it first came out. That fact was literally the only reason why I started watching this movie, because other than that, neither the trailer nor the Netflix slideshow looked too appealing.Her acting was unfortunately very bland and inauthentic. I've never seen someone fail so hard at playing a sad person (scene at the airport).The only acting that I approve of is the one from little Honor Kneafsey (Princess Emily) and Alice Krige (Queen Helena). If the story would have been less fast paced in the right moments, they could have given an even stronger performance.Costume and Art Department obviously didn't have a lot of budget or interest in this movie because it all looked very cheap and not exquisit as I would expect from royalty.The extras have been dressed like they would attend a regular office Christmas party and the main actresses dress at the ball - I have no words for how horrible it looked. In combination to the cheap decoration and un-royal-like set up of the happening it felt more like a prom that went slightly down the drain.The story was kinda bleh and not thought through, but I could have had a real chance if the right crew would have been involved in this project.My recommendation: Save yourself the time and watch The Princess Switch instead.",A Christmas Prince
90,Vylpecula,This is everything wrong with society.,4,15 December 2020,"Simple, conservative, heteronormative garbage with nice visuals.",A Christmas Prince
91,alexandreajcook,Take it in good spirits,7,18 November 2017,"This is cheesy and a straight-shooting plot line. It's an easy watch, enjoyable movie, but don't expect much substance. The acting and script are a little cringy, but it fits the tone of the movie to a tee. You won't remember it, and you won't recommend it but if you enjoy films like the princess diaries or Hallmark movies then this one's for you.",A Christmas Prince
92,trueillusion-166-108556,Jeez...,1,19 December 2017,"Possibly the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. And, believe me, I've seen thousands of cheesy movies. Only decent acting is the kid.",A Christmas Prince
93,aidamuu,A lovley christmas movie,10,13 December 2017,"This movie gave me a new purpose of life. 
I learned a about horses and how fast they can run and I also learned that it could be good to hide your stuff sometimes.A very romantic and beautiful christmas movie, I will watch it every December from now on :--)",A Christmas Prince
94,houstonyaokets,A feel-good Christmas-sy film!,7,19 December 2018,"This movie starred Rose McIver, AKA that lovely iZombie lady. and it's produced by Netflix, it's can't be that bad, right? And you know what? Like a Christmas fruitcake, it's really not that bad!Is this a typical ""when a commoner meet Prince Charming"" Rom-Com? Yes, it is! But is it also a feel-good Christmas-sy film where the family can get together for 2 hours without the need for a political discussion? Well, YES IT IS! And it's actually not that predictable, some plotlines actually did catch me by surprise.And Rose McIver was brilliant in it, not overly just a pretty girl next door like most Xmas film leading actresses are, she has to make all the important decision to save Prince Charming (No spoilers) and had some really funny scenes. Ben Lamb is Prince Charming, He's a Prince William lookalike, and like his doppelganger, he's British-ly charming and well-liked. The rest of the casts are wonderful too, they acted quite well, you won't turn off your tv because of their acting, that's for sure.So if you are looking for a Christmas film that's suitable for the whole family to watch after a hearty Christmas feast so as to avoid the traditional awkward relatives Q&A, Netflix and watch ""A Christmas Prince""!",A Christmas Prince
95,chandellevdk-87003,Loved it!,10,18 November 2017,"Loved it! This was exactly the kind of romance movie that I needed. Please, Netflix make a sequel or a series about them. Ben Lamb was perfect for the job he's so handsome and dreamy his eyes are the way to his soul. Maybe it was kinda bad that she did as if she was someone else but in the end it was wort it! I would recommend that if you have Netflix and if you like romance movies go watch it you will like it!",A Christmas Prince
96,leviCS,Captivating movie,10,22 November 2017,"A Christmas Prince is a fantastic movie, made to be watched by people of all ages. The movie has a good introduction and a amazing development. The connection between Rose Mclver and Ben Lamb worked very well, Honor Kneafsey did a great job and Alice Krige did a perfect queen and, at the same time, a lovable mother. Also, the scenarios of the movie are amazing and wonderful. This is a great movie to watch with the family during the Christmas day.",A Christmas Prince
97,pamela-17911,"Is this satire? If yes, this is genius!",7,18 November 2017,"This has to be satire! It has to be. I can't be convinced otherwise! And in that case, it's amazing! Lol Just every hallmark cliché you could possibly think of making fun of those movies by being every single one of those movies, hahaha. But kind of done perfectly! Like, better than the hallmark movies whilst also making fun of them, haha. I was delighted But if this theory is wrong, alas! That would have made a way better movie...",A Christmas Prince
98,abwestropp,a journalist goes to Aldovia to get the scoop on a prince but gets something else instead,10,20 November 2017,I love this movie SO much. it is the only movie i will watch this Christmas. I've watched it 7 times in the past 24 hours. I think that everybody who loves Christmas should watch this movie and even people who don't. I love romance movies and this one is perfect. thanks to Netflix i will not get my homework done cause i will be watching this movie.,A Christmas Prince
99,tlaw-77998,"Best Christmas, Romance and all around Family Movie EVER! WOW!!!",10,24 November 2017,"I don't often write my own personal reviews of movies, unless I am TOTALLY Blown Away! The Best Actors & Cast members for the Best Movies of this type. However even the word ""type"" does this Awesome Movie a Great injustice. This is too Unique and hits every button and tick a giant Check Mark in every box of THE PERFECT MOVIE! I Actually Felt so personally invested that I felt I was ""There""! I know I've seen this Ben Lamb guy before & thought he was Great every time I watched one of his movies. Also the Lead Actress & the Awesome Actress who played Prince Richards Mother, the Queen. One of the All Time Greats as well. If I'm not mistaken, I believe the young Princess is the girl who played in the Movie ""Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory"". Her role & acting was makes me want to see her play many more Roles in Movies of this Caliber and so many other genre, along with all of the other Lead Actors/Actresses. I've even seen & Loved greatly the actress who Held Everything together in several recent roles, so Superbly. In closing, I simply want to say, Thank You So Much for one of the Best Movies & Movie Experiences EVER!",A Christmas Prince
100,wonnderlannd,Charming but forgettable,5,26 November 2017,"A Christmas Prince, Netflix's latest original movie, is perfect to pass the time and engage in the holiday spirit but offers not much else, making it a forgettable hour and a half.The plot lines are typical and very Pride and Prejudice-esque: a career- minded woman jumps on the opportunity to cover a buzzworthy story on the prince of Aldovia whose playboy reputation clashes with the expectations of a king, especially as he is projected to take the throne before the new year. Of course, the prince's reputation is revealed to be a misunderstanding. After some plot progressions, twists, and opposing political forces, the two ultimately find a way to be together.The main character's rival for the prince's affections, a more affluent and ""better-suited"" candidate for the prince, makes hard remarks about her social standing. The prince's cousin and opponent for the throne goes as far as to refer to her as a peasant. Of course, the prince is able to see past this and love her for herself, regardless of class difference. Though the movie's main takeaway stresses that it is love above all that transcends class boundaries, its clear that it feeds into the fantasy or ideology of class mobilization for the middle class through romantic love.The movie is cute and heartwarming at times, but its predictable plot makes it a snooze. It's a charming and typical Hallmark movie for the holidays.",A Christmas Prince
101,gaelt-06795,Great Family Movie,10,27 November 2017,"Very good family movie. Makes you happy and smile. Of course, if you expect Titanic, Lord of the Rings or Avatar, it will not work. But a super family movie, enjoyable for all ages, then go for it. We had a marvelous evening watching A Christmas Prince. Can only recommend this movie.",A Christmas Prince
102,aimeeli,"Heart warming, unpredictable, perfect",10,30 November 2017,"This is the best movie I have ever seen. I was on the edge of my seat the entire movie. Twists and turns, with incredible acting and uplifting diverse characters. Amber stays true to herself the entire movie. She is not like other girls, which is truly inspiring. I have already watched this movie 8 times in the last hour. Can't stop. Love it.",A Christmas Prince
103,kimklaniecki,What is the opening song?,7,4 December 2017,"My rating is based on coming this to other overtly chick flick/romance movies, not compared to all movies across all genres. The acting was better than expected and the movie was funnier than expected, but there not as much romance as anticipated and the plot was weaker than expected.Bu what is the name and artist of the first song that plays during the opening titles? I can't find it anywhere and the FAQ section isn't available yet, so I wrote this review just to post the question.",A Christmas Prince
104,alyssakemery,Loved it!,9,4 December 2017,"I don't understand why so many people are giving this movie such low reviews. I really liked it! It was well thought out and the friendships and romance were genuine and natural. I'd say the only thing I wasn't a fan of was, as some have already mentioned, the background characters because they showed a small lack of originality. It didn't bother me at all, but I suppose I can see how some critics might've been turned off. However, in retrospect to the people who love movies like this, I have to say that the writers, actors, and directors did a good job breaking clichés and finding ways to make the movie special for their targeted audience. Overall a great movie to watch with your family. I highly recommend watching it: you won't be wasting your time ;)",A Christmas Prince
105,bearylarkin,Not Too Serious,10,9 December 2018,"This movie was great, honestly. It was a nice, cheesy breath of fresh air from a world of uptight realism. A fun, royally themed rom-com to watch in December with family, or a small group of friends. Whether you really like cheesy romantic movies, or just want a good laugh at the not-to-great acting, it's a good flick.",A Christmas Prince
106,mithicah-05948,Glosses over misogyny that royalty has perpetuated for centures.,2,17 December 2018,"The movie itself was ""cute"" like I expected. What I find appalling is that no one seems to see the blatant misogyny of this film. The kingdom faces a crisis when it turns out that the prince is adopted. To me the bigger crises is the fact that the true heir to the throne should be the daughter. Rather than address that misogyny, instead, the law is changed to allow an adopted son, read male, become king. Why does no one seem concerned about the fact women have been denied inheritance for centuries simply due to the fact they were born female?This film would have been much better had Emily inherited the throne as the biological heir. We need more movies that acknowledge the discrimination that women have experienced throughout history, rather than films that perpetuate it.",A Christmas Prince
107,howellkay,The patriarchy is strong in this one,1,24 December 2018,"I created an imdb account exclusively to give this movie a terrible review. Simply put, this movie could be five minutes long: succession passes to the nearest relation. Done. This movie was made a year ago? News flash: woman can be in charge. Emily can take the throne.
Everyone can calm the fudge down. We would all be better people if this piece of...fudge had never been perpetated upon us. Netflix, do better.",A Christmas Prince
