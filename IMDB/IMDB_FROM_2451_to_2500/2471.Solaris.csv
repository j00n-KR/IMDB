0,MartinHafer,How do I give this movie a score--there just isn't much I can compare it to!,6,5 August 2007,"This is one of the stranger films I have ever seen and although I have seen several other Russian films and was not entirely put off by the amazingly slow pacing, I was left wondering whether or not I even liked the film! The film starts on Earth. It's supposed to be in the future, but how far in uncertain. What is certain is that the homes and dress look like the 1970s--not a Hollywood or European film view of the 1970s or the future--just the 1970s. At this point, the audience is confused, because although you don't know the year, the entire context for the film is missing--things just ARE and the film moves as if the audience somehow knows what is occurring and what has occurred.What slowly becomes apparent is that there is an Earth space station in orbit over some planet. Additionally, some mystery surrounds the base and bizarre reports of things happening on the supposedly barren surface alarm some and don't seem to matter to the protagonist in the film, Kris Kelvin. He then goes to Solyaris to investigate but seems to have little emotion or motivation.Once there, he soon realizes that the two remaining people on the station and himself are subject to bizarre contacts from the planet below. Instead of contacting them by radio or telepathically, a unique person from one's past appears to each of the three--though the only one you really see in more than glimpses is Kelvin's deceased wife, Hari. Now you know and the rest of the audience knows that this can't be Hari. Even if she were alive, she'd be back on Earth but somehow Kelvin is so captivated by her that he refuses to believe she isn't real. While she MAY be real, it is certain she ain't Hari! Despite Kelvin's desire to just lie around and enjoy reminiscing and sleeping with Hari, the other two scientists somehow think this is a bad plan, so one of them comes up with an incomprehensible plan to use Kelvin's EEG pattern to stop the transmissions from the planet. How, exactly, he came up with this plan is really vague, but at the end of the film, the apparitions on the space station stop and Kelvin decides to go back to Earth. But, in an excellent twist, you are left wondering exactly WHAT happened.Despite my liking the ending very much, the basic premise and some of the lovely cinematography, the end product was a very mixed bag. The film was meant to be an artsy film and often spent WAAAAYYYY too long on scenes that should have been shortened in order to keep the audience awake. Now I do like longer movies and a 3 or 4 hour film isn't daunting to me, but this film should have had at least 1/2 hour taken out of it. Too many scenes show close-ups of weeds moving in the water, cars driving for 5 minutes along a highway in Japan (pointlessly, I might add) and people staring off into space. Now some of these excesses didn't surprise me (heck, I've see the Russian version of WAR AND PEACE twice--and it runs more than 6 1/2 hours in the American version), but that still didn't excuse the overly long shots. Had this not been an ""art"" film, critics most likely would have torn apart the film for this reason. I truly think that had it been only a 2 hour movie, it would have been better and I would have scored it at least an 8.This one is like watching a film marathon. A pretty good film marathon, but a marathon nonetheless.",Solaris
1,TheLittleSongbird,Possibly Tarkovsky at his least accessible but from personal opinion Solaris is a fine film,9,6 January 2015,"Not my favourite of Tarkovsky's work(Andrei Rublev) and like I said with Stalker not his most accessible(Ivan's Childhood). It is very long, quite talky and requires a lot of patience, sure almost all of Tarkovsky's film, apart from Ivan's Childhood, are paced very deliberately but Solaris is the only one with a first twenty minutes that puts you off seeing more.However, Solaris is a fine film indeed from a remarkably consistent director(one of the few who didn't make a bad film) and is an important one by his standards and for the sci-fi genre. Tarkovsky's direction is typically superb and it's visually striking, not as dream-like as say Mirror but it's beautifully shot and has a hypnotic quality that keeps your eyes glued to the screen, providing that you're in the right mood or if it's your thing. The music score is both menacing and melancholic and compliments the mood incredibly effectively, one of the better scores of Tarkovsky's films. As ever with Tarkovsky, the writing is very thoughtful in a philosophical way(the most philosophical Tarkovsky film) and the story is one where it starts off very slow but once you stick with it it's very rewarding. Didn't have any real trouble with following it, though it is understandable it wouldn't work for people as it didn't quite click with me first time watching it(I still appreciated what the film was trying to do though).Most effective was how amazingly Solaris worked as a mood-piece. It may not be the most powerful(Andrei Rublev) or personal(Mirror) Tarkovsky film, but it was still powerful stuff, almost as suspenseful as Stalker and had a lot of emotional impact. The ending was spine-chilling, even people I know who dislike it said that they were bowled over by the ending. The acting is fine especially with the heart-wrenching performance of Natalya Bondarchuk. Overall, a fine and influential film but it is one of those films that will captivate viewers and frustrate others. 9/10 Bethany Cox",Solaris
2,Leofwine_draca,One of the slowest and dullest films ever made,1,23 December 2016,"Andrei Tarkovsky's cerebral science fiction outing is widely considered by his fans to be a work of genius. He's adored for creating an intelligent masterpiece, rich in beautiful cinematography, and delivering a haunting storyline tackling the topics of loss and obsession. That's all well and good, but he forgot to make his near-three hour film entertaining along the way.I admit, I hated this film. If the dialogue-free opening ten minutes, composed entirely of landscape shots, hadn't warned me that this wasn't going to be my cup of tea then the next half an hour, consisting entirely of back story via flashbacks, convinced me of it. Then there's a car journey through Moscow that takes ten minutes, and I couldn't help thinking how much more interesting Paul Greengrass's car chase in the same city at the end of THE BOURNE SUPREMACY was. Finally we move to space, but if anything the story slows down even more, so much so that I lost interest in it entirely.Yes, it's a mood piece and yes, it's a clever film that doesn't pander to the masses. But it's also the slowest film I've ever watched, and I can't help thinking there's something more than a little pretentious in the director's efforts to drag his viewer's attention spans out to breaking point. As a result I absolutely hated this non-entity of a film and have no desire to ever go near it again in future.",Solaris
3,SnoopyStyle,Russian,6,15 September 2016,Kris Kelvin is a psychologist ready to launch to Solaris. He's with his family reviewing tapes of the confusing interrogation of pilot Berton about the floundering mission. He arrives at the space station to find it in disrepair. Snaut and Sartorius are in haunted isolation while Gibarian had committed suicide. He is visited by hallucinations of his dead wife Khari.This is an art-house sci-fi from the Soviet era. The first act goes too slowly. There is a lot of talk. I'm not sure putting it in a Russian dacha is terribly exciting although it's very Russian. Berton's interrogation is strangely disconnected because Kris is not the person doing the interrogation. The actual space station is an odd mix of futurism and a contemporary home office. It's all very art-house. The alien ocean looks beautifully hypnotic. The idea of the story and its treatment is original and intriguing.,Solaris
4,Hitchcoc,Real Science Fiction,10,22 December 2016,"This is more than a Sci Fi film. It is intelligent, provocative, and extremely well directed. It involves a planet, Solaris, which is a puzzle to astronomers. Astronauts have been there and one, in particular, has been affected by the planet. Of course, he is initially thought to be suffering from some mental imbalance and hallucinations. But as explorations go on, there seems to be something about the oceans on the planet. They seem to be sentient. While this is an incredibly long film, it is a joy to watch. I believe that this is a film that requires a second look, especially if you think you got it. Of course, it's in Russian, and that makes certain demands on English speaking viewers, but many of the events are visual, with fairly long, almost surreal moments. I put this near the top of all the films I have ever seen.",Solaris
5,Horst_In_Translation,"An occasionally interesting sci-fi film at best, never defining for its genre",4,11 August 2019,"""Solyaris"", more commonly known as ""Solaris"", is a Soviet movie from 1972, so this one is not too far away anymore from its 50th anniversary, maybe it happened already depending on when you read this review. The director and also one of the writers is Andrei Tarkovsky and here he adapted Stanislaw Lem's novel for the screen. I have not read the latter, so cannot really say much about parallels and differences between film and book, but the success of this movie, even if it is no longer in the imdb top250, certainly made Lem also more famous. Now with the name Tarkovsky you probably already guessed correctly that this is a truly long work and still at slightly under 2 hours 50 minutes by far not his longest. Enough said. I won't go into detail about the cast here. None of them are famous to me or probably 99% of all other viewers who don't have roots or a big interest in old Soviet films. Don't be fooled by the inclusion of ""German"" here as one of the film's languages, there is really only a very very brief sequence in which one character sings a German song. The cast list looks longer than it felt to me, this is totally not a film with many characters in it, especially compared to other works by Tarkovsky. The best example is Andrey Rublov which I saw just the day before this one as there is a Tarkovsky retrospective going on here in Berlin right now. The good news is I liked this one more. The bad news is I still did not like it too much. Even those more positive aspects like the use of color especially early on outside nature-wise eventually backfire because it felt extremely random when colors were used and when they weren't. Like there is a sequence with color, then a character watches an old video and afterwards, in the now again, there is still no color or just very bleak colors. Sure you could explain it in all kinds of different ways like in a way this shows how the old video still has an impact on him in the now, but for me it just wasn't really working.I would say the first half was better than the second. The actors overall did a pretty decent job, even if nobody really stood out. Well, at least not lead actor Banionis (who died around five years ago). Bondarchuk, really almost the only female cast member in here, was probably still the best from the bunch, but I don't know maybe I am also just saying this because I am a straight male and she was really stunning. Nonetheless, even if I liked her, I felt her story line about well.. being actually not her, but the result of imagination and perhaps an alien live form, went for way too long for the film's own good. You could almost call it a romance drama then somehow, well tragedy is even more accurate because we knew from the beginning it is not really her, even if she develops human traits the more time she spent with him. So yes, again for Tarkovsky I'd say it would have been better if this film had more convincing focus and maybe only run for 2 hours or so. Still, there are good scenes and aspects and moments and it did not bore me as much as the other release from the filmmaker that I mentioned earlier. For example the spaceship sets are really good. Costumes and makeup aren't too shabby either, definitely sub-par for early 1970s. And the final shot of the protagonist on his knees in the human real world again is also one to remember. Shame most of the stuff before that really isn't. I have a feeling Tarkovsky is just not my kind of filmmaker, but there is no denying this is a pretty interesting approach at the sci-fi genre, one I don't like too much either. So maybe this is also partially subjective the reason why I am giving this a thumbs-down overall. If you like the genre/filmmaker more though, go check it out. But if you are not won over yet around the 1-hour mark, then let it be, it is not really getting better afterwards. Oh well, actually the romance part that follows takes the film into a completely different direction then, but certainly not one that works too well. I say watch something else instead. Oh and by the way what is up with the dwarf again? Now that was so random and almost the only funny moment. Is this inclusion a Tarkovsky running gag?",Solaris
6,claudio_carvalho,Original Approach of First Contact and Alien Lifeform,7,24 September 2008,"When the scientist Fechner disappears in the surface of the mysterious Solaris Ocean, the experienced helicopter pilot Henri Berton (Vladislav Dvorzhetsky) crosses a fog seeking out Fechner and has weird visions. His statement is presented to a commission of scientists that believe he had hallucinations. However, the widowed psychologist Kris Kelvin (Donatas Banionis) is assigned to the space station that orbits Solaris to check the mental health of the three remaining scientists that are still working there. He first meets Dr. Snaut (Jüri Järvet), who tells him that Dr. Gibarian (S. Sarkisyan) committed suicide, and later he meets Dr. Sartorius (Anatoli Solonitsyn) and he realizes that the scientists have strange behaviors. When he encounters his wife Hari (Natalya Bondarchuk), who died ten years ago, in the space station, the scientists explain to Kris that the Solaris Ocean has the ability to materialize the innermost thoughts in neutrons beings. Kris questions whether the appearance of his beloved wife is a curse or a blessing.""Solyaris"" is an original (or maybe the most original) approach to first contact and alien life-form in the cinema history. The story is disclosed in an extremely low-pace through a flawed screenplay (at least for those like me that have not read the novel) that uses many ellipsis and poor art decoration, but beautifully raises philosophical questions about love, death, understanding, communication, fear for the unknown, origin of life, and Solaris Ocean might be the Paradise or even God. The intriguing story is open to interpretations and not recommended for those viewers that expect to see a conventional sci-fi movie. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Solaris""",Solaris
7,gavin6942,The Russian Sci Fi Masterpiece?,7,30 July 2015,"A psychologist is sent to a station orbiting a distant planet in order to discover what has caused the crew to go insane.Unfortunately, many know ""Solaris"" from the remake. And the remake just does not add up. One individual I know watched it over and over and tried to convince himself it was good. He never succeeded, and now he is no longer with us.Maybe we don't think of Russia when we think of ""sci fi"", which is strange. Keep in mind through the 1950s and 60s, it was Russia that as actively opposing America in the space race. Surely they had stories to tell about what might be up there, beyond the edge of the atmosphere. And, indeed, with this film alongside ""Stalker"", it is evident that Russian science fiction is strong.",Solaris
8,lee_eisenberg,knowledge of the outside vs. knowledge of oneself,10,19 May 2013,"Andrei Tarkovsky's adaptation of Stanisław Lem's ""Solaris"" (called ""Solyaris"" in Russian) seems to be posing the question of our connection to ourselves and other people. We invest so much in trying to understand the universe that we forget about our relationships with each other. A lot of the movie is sure to remind one of Stanley Kubrick's ""2001"", but it goes much further in the philosophical respect. It's the sort of movie that should give anyone a lot of admiration for the people involved, especially since the Soviet government probably didn't allow them significant resources. But the truth is that the movie doesn't need special effects. It's all about what the characters come to realize about themselves, and it's a real masterpiece. There was a remake, but I have no aim to watch that.",Solaris
9,jboothmillard,Solaris,8,18 October 2010,"I did not realise that the George Clooney film was a remake, nor that this original featured in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, so I watched this version first, from director Andrei Tarkovsky (Mirror). Basically Solaris is a space mission with a base established on a planet that hosts a kind of intelligence, but the details are secret. The last scientist to be stationed in the base had weird visions and has disappeared into the Solaris Ocean, and helicopter pilot Henri Berton (Vladislav Dvorzhetsky) searched for him. It is believed the scientist was suffering hallucinations, and the Solaris commission need a man to find out the state of the three remaining men on the station in space. This job is assigned to widowed psychologist Kris Kelvin (Donatas Banionis), and there he meets Dr. Snaut (Jüri Järvet) who tells him that a friend among the scientists Dr. Gibarian (Sos Sargsyan) mysteriously died, well, it was suicide. A little later, Dr. Sartorius (Anatoli Solonitsyn) confirms with Kris that the remaining scientists also have strange behaviours, and he is soon to join them. Kris's wife Hari (Natalya Bondarchuk) died ten years ago after committing suicide, and all of the sudden he is appearing to be seeing and interacting with her. The scientists explain to Kris that the Solaris Ocean has the ability to materialise inner thoughts for someone into a realistic style being. Kris questions whether the appearance of his wife is real or not, but also whether it is a good thing or a bad thing. After many weird happenings, Kris finds himself back at home on Earth with his Father (Nikolai Grinko) at the old house, and when the camera zooms out we see that it is on a small island in the middle of the Solaris Ocean. I will be honest and say that because it was in Russian it was hard to keep up with what was going on, but at the same time it is probably all not meant to make sense. It was certainly more chatty than filled with special effects, and when there were effects it had a 2001: A Space Odyssey feel about it, I just enjoyed the hypnotic strangeness, it makes it an influential science-fiction drama. Very good!",Solaris
10,rmax304823,Not Nice To Fool Mother Nature.,7,11 January 2014,"I missed the first 26 minutes of the movie and that may account in part for the fact that I found it confusing and challenging. Evidently, a scientist, Kris, is sent to a remote space station orbiting a distant planet to find out what's going on. One of the three or four crew has committed suicide.Kris finds the remaining scientists a diverse lot. They're hospitable enough, showing him around the spacious circular craft and telling him he can choose any room he likes. But Kris notices a few strange things. There seem to be ""others"" wandering around. A young child (or maybe a midget) appears briefly, a scientist sweeps the kid up in his arms and runs off with him. Kris catches wispy glimpses of a young girl from a distance. When he asks about these figures, the others tell him to mind his own business, except for the leader of the crew, Snaut, who answers with philosophical non-answers about what constitutes happiness and what man's fate is and other heady subjects.It gets headier. Kris falls asleep in his bed and a girl appears, Hari, with whom he once consorted but left, not loving her, until years later when he realized he did. But by then she had committed suicide.Now here she is again. Apparently alive if not exactly vibrant. Finally the other scientists spill the beans. They've bombarded the ocean below with heavy radiation, and the ocean seems to have responded by redintegrating figures from the crew's past -- a child, a young girl, and now Hari.The problem is that the ""guests"" are just that -- materialized figures drawn from memory. They're described as made not of atoms but neutrinos. ""Masses of jelly,"" one of the more cynical scientist calls them. And they're incomplete. They retain only flashbulb memories of their own past. And you can't get rid of them because, sooner or later, you must sleep and dream, and they return. Kris, for instance, sends one off into space in a rocket. No dice. Next time he nods out, Hari reappears.The headiness persists. Obviously, the movie is either profound -- ""deeply profound"" -- or just thrown together in a slapdash manner to make it seem provocative. The sound track sometimes comes up with an ominous hum, at other time an organ piece that sounds like Bach with a hangover. There are quotes from Cervantes and Tolstoy. Ultimately, Kris is faced with the choice of either staying aboard with his passionate but insubstantial neutrino wreaths or returning to reality on earth. He chooses the latter and the final scene was so unexpected, so much a non sequitur, that it left me wondering if my brain had turned into a jellied mass of neutrinos.It's all very melancholy. Kris never laughs, never even smiles, nor does Hari or anyone else, except for one or two puzzling cackles from a drunken man. I'm going to assume that instead of being meaningless it's chock full of ideas, though I may have caught less than half of them. It's long and it's slow but it's not simple minded. Cf., the ""Twilight Zone"" episode called ""The Lonely,"" in which an exiled convict is given a very humanoid female robot for company and simply falls in love with her. Kris's attitude towards his ""robot"" is far less ordinary. And then thee are questions about the frontiers of science. Should we really try to change something we know little about? We're currently exterminating previously unknown species of primates in the Amazon rain forest. Primates -- that's us. Well -- judge for yourself.",Solaris
11,Tweekums,Soviet Sci-Fi,8,2 October 2009,"When I sat down to watch this I thought it might be a long haul as I'd read that it was slow paced and two and three quarter hours long; I needn't have worried as the time seemed fly by. It is different just about every other space based science fiction in that there aren't lots of shots of spacecraft travelling through a starlit sky or exotic views of strange planets, most of the film takes place on a space station although you probably wouldn't realise this from most scenes.Set in the future a scientist on the Solaris space station which is orbiting a distant ocean planet has gone missing and the man who went out looking for him has given a report so utterly fantastical that it must have been an hallucination. Kris Kelvin, a psychiatrist is sent to evaluate the three remaining scientists there. When he arrives he finds that one of them has killed himself and the other two aren't behaving in the most rational of ways. This isn't the strangest thing going on there though; he meets another person there, his ex-wife Hari who had died ten years previously. It appears that she has been created by the planet's ocean which is actually a sentient being.The film has a very strange feel to it; there is almost no background music and what there is sounds more like noise than music and the picture changes from colour to black and white in a way that seemed strange to me. Perhaps the biggest surprise however was the total lack of overt politics or even flag waving, I'd expected a Soviet film would have the hammer and sickle on show at the very least. The director and his cast did a great job with a story that could easily have been boring if it hadn't been made so well.These comments are based on watching the film in Russian with English subtitles, not having seen the Hollywood remake I can't compare the two versions.",Solaris
12,Quinoa1984,"""You mean more to me than any scientific truth.""",10,3 September 2006,"One line could not sum up a film like Solaris, certainly not even one of the quotes from the characters who sometimes dip into the philosophical. But that line does still speak to me after now having seen the film twice, and still feeling as if I haven't really SEEN it altogether. Or at least maybe felt, or taken in. Andrei Tarkovsky considered this his least favorite film, and perhaps as a filmmaker myself I could understand. With a pace that never once breaks from the consistency of its focus on the differences between Nature and Earth and technology and science, as well as love, loss, memory, etc, it can be tricky for the director not to find something to critique of himself. And as it was, according to an interview on the DVD, Tarkovsky was obsessed with his work to the point of perfectionism. But, as has been put forward more times than need be to count from reading reviews and comments, this is the Russian equivalent of Kubrick's 2001 really only on two fronts, the pushing forward of boundaries in experiencing visions of what can truly never be known, and letting its characters find out what it means to be without Earth so far out in space (and equally what can stick around).But Tarkovsky is not interested in the same obsessions that had Kubrick and Clarke, and so the comparisons can only go so far before it's really just time to take the film on its own terms, or at least in relation to other science fiction films. It's not about true discovery into the unknown and reaching for mysteries rooted in us as apes. The discoveries of Solaris are known pretty well to anyone who's lived and loved and lost and not been able to connect once lost. The character of Kris Kelvin (Donatas Banionis, one of the two really stirring performances of the film) starts off on Earth surrounded by natures plenty, and as a mostly stone-faced widower its almost until halfway through the film that we finally see what can be tapped into in his empirically based mind. The exposition- handled through a testimony of a scarred spaceman- tells of an Ocean, being studied by the Solarists, that has started to have a life-force of its own, creating what may or may not be there for those close to it. When Kelvin arrives at the Solaris station, around two weary and worn scientists for the cause, he gets the effect of a resurrected person- his deceased wife Hari (Natalya Bondarchuk, the other one)- who's own ambiguities and connections as real or copy start to bring the real psychological panic to the film.All of this is done in such a way that is easy to assume as boring. But if you give yourself to the style of the film, stay with the pacing, it is rewarding on its own level, perhaps too in its way comparable to 2001, as it leaves enough to interpret. Tarkovsky is not after anything conventional, which can be seen as a draw back for some. Solaris asks its viewer to take a more emotional journey than one that might find a little creature or lots of real 'action'. Kelvin's time with his new Hari is contrasted against the near empty space station, as he has formed out his wife from somewhere inside of him. In fact it's probably so much connected with philosophical overtones- with at least some time given to talking about the whats and whys of really seeking out something outside of Earth that can only be understood in logic beyond simplicity. At the same time a love story is also worked in, or rather a love constricted within boundaries of perception and the surreal. Why can't Hari be killed or disappear? What happens when Kelvin has his fever late in the film? And can Hari ever really feel at peace with him? What's love when reflected upon? The questions raised, which may or may not be answered by the end of the film (though it had an ending that had me saying out loud ""oh wow"", in part surprise and in part seeing how the factor of the 'Guests' made perfect sense), are put to a backdrop of something that can really be described as something of great art. It might leave little parts that are imperfect, but overall like some big epic poem Tarkovsky's film sinks deep into its subject matter that for those who can grasp enough of it in one or two viewings can take that in tow with the style. And, as mentioned before, at almost three hours it carries as much weight on the side of capturing the visuals as it does of expressing the characters. There's a beauty to nature, and it's seen with just as clear and undiscriminating an eye as the long scene on the road driving (my personal favorite), the oceans in space, and the corridors of the ship are seen as enclosing and impersonal. Some of these images on their own had me re-watching them on their own, just to see how he and his crew did it. It's got that desire to raise questions that marks the most interesting science fiction, in this case to terrify us by the nature of the people affected by realized abstractions, and to conjure some thought as to what's in us as much as what might be out there. An extraordinary movie that is, to be expected, going to draw its audience as take it or leave it. If you do take it, it marks as one of those movies that asks for your patience and then delivers as much once its over as it did when it was on.",Solaris
13,preppy-3,Incredibly slow and dull,1,10 February 2014,A psychologist is sent to a space station orbiting a distant planet to find out why the whole crew went insane. While there he slowly (VERY slowly) realizes something is wrong.I caught this at a revival theatre years ago. I heard it was long and slow but I sometimes like movies like that. Well it WAS long and slow...also boring. There's nothing wrong with a movie taking it's time to get started BUT you should make sure to give the audience something to think about or ponder and not just expect them to patiently wait till they're ready. The first hour of this was a real chore. I was fighting to stay awake but eventually lost the battle and did doze off. It did start moving after that but (again) it was slow and uninvolving. I will admit the final shot gave me chills but it was too little too late. Slow and boring does not make a movie a masterpiece and I'm not too dumb to get it. It's slow and boring--that's all there is to it.,Solaris
14,grantss,"Original and intriguing plot, executed painfully slowly",7,24 March 2017,"Kris Kelvin is a renowned psychologist, about to head to the space station orbiting the planet Solaris. Several years earlier Solaris was the focal point of scientific research. Then a research party met with a fatal accident while exploring the surface and a member of the rescue party reported seeing strange apparitions. This dimmed the scientific community's interest in the planet to the extent that the space station's crew has decreased from 85 to only 3. When Dr Kelvin arrives he immediately senses that something strange is afoot...Directed by renowned Russian director Andrei Tarkovsky, the movie has his trademark thought-provocation and beautifully lingering camera shots. The plot itself is original and, for the most part, intriguing.However, it is also massively padded (and I'm not referring the aforementioned lingering camera shots - those are pure art). While Stalker was equally long, it never drifted or got bogged down. Solaris, on the other hand, has long stretches that don't add anything to the movie and feel like old ground being re-covered. Most of these scenes involve the romantic angle to the movie, an angle that was necessary to the plot but was massively overdone and over-sentimentalised. Instead of a profound sci fi drama you often feel you're watching a sappy romantic drama.It all comes together in the end though, but via a rather torturous route.Good, but could have been great.",Solaris
15,Boba_Fett1138,The year we made contact.,9,29 July 2008,"I had never seen a Andrei Tarkovsky movie before, even though he is generally regarded as the most famous Soviet film-maker since Sergei M. Eisenstein but I definitely intend to see more movies by him now. He seemed to be a film-maker with a love for the art of movies. His directing is passionated and he really knew how to tell a story, despite the fact that this movie is slow...very slow! No wonder that the movie is 165 minutes long.""Solyaris"" is definitely comparable to Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey "", not just with its story or concept (or better said the confusedness of it all) but also definitely with its style and pace. The movie doesn't feature any more dialog than necessary and there are large parts in the movie were no word is spoken at all.It's a rare true intelligent science-fiction movie. Every sequences can be basically interpreted in your own way. It's true poetry captured on film. Certain sequences have deeper meanings to it, somethings you'll catch, others you won't. This is also the reason why ""Solyaris"" is a movie that only gets better on repeated viewings.Besided science-fiction, the movie can also be seen as a drama, a mystery movie and even a romantic one. The fact that this movie is labeled as a science-fiction movie doesn't simply mean that it's about space or the future. ""Solyaris"" is about many things and it above all is a very humane movie, with a realistic touch to it. Even though it has an unusual story and some unique storytelling the movie is not that hard or completely not understandable to follow as you perhaps had heard or would expect from a movie with a concept such as this one.The movie is based on the novel 'Solaris' by Polish auteur Stanislaw Lem. In the beginning of the pre-production stages of this movie Lem was still very much involved and spend lots of time with Tarkovsky in Moscow, developing the movie. The collaboration however did not ended well since Tarkovsky (as every director) wanted to make some changes and additions to the story. He also wasn't too happy with the end result, though his points of criticism don't really seem valid to me. He just complained because it wasn't exactly like his book and Tarkovsky in parts put the focus on different aspects, which simply works out well for the movie and are a foremost reason why this movie is such an absolutely great and effective one.An impressive and just plain great, intelligent Soviet answer to ""2001: A Space Odyssey"".9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Solaris
16,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Let it take you,10,20 December 2011,"The interestingly designed space station Solaris(which is where we spend the majority of this) has seen reports of hallucinations, and Kris Kelvin, a psychologist, goes aboard to examine the mental health of the three scientists working there. Upon arrival, he finds that one of them is dead, and he sees his wife - who has been dead for a decade. It turns out that the planet they are orbiting is home to some intelligence they cannot fathom, and it brings aspects of their subconscious to life. He can interact with her, but is it the real person? What makes a human being? This explores issues of identity, happiness, man as not being the center of the universe, the foreign and unexplained, connection, communication and spiritualism vs. science. At just about exactly 160 minutes and with its slow pace, it is not for everyone. That is not an insult to anyone who doesn't or wouldn't like it; it is meant as art, and it is for the same type of people who enjoy delving into a detailed novel. Nothing is served up, you have to think for yourself, and no, it does not really take off until about an hour in(not to insinuate that what comes before is a waste of one's time). The direction is brilliant. Once this gripped me, I couldn't take my eyes off it(so for the last hour and a half), and I felt truly engaged in the philosophical not to mention very physical troubles. How do you react to see someone brought back from the dead, as someone who knows that such things do not happen? Is it really them? How, or why not? Meanwhile, those questions don't make her disappear. And then there are the moments that are literally that. Impressions. Half-forgotten instances from the past, what seems so terribly far gone. There are characters that do not get a line in this. They appear for a minimal amount of time. And yet you get an idea of what they were like, the relationship between them and our protagonist. The atmosphere is suffocating, inescapable. This is a visually and emotionally beautiful film. It is not driven by its FX, if some of them remain great. This is not perfect. The car sequence is arguably weak, and Andrei himself remarked that it was there to ""get the idiots out of the theatre"", for example. Do not bother with the 2002 remake. There is a little nudity, disturbing content and brutal, bloody violence in this. The DVD comes with a 10 and a half minute documentary on Donatas Banionis entitled ""Master from the Town"", a 5 and a half minute interview Natalya Sergeyevna Bondarchuk(where she gives us fun facts about the production), a 5 minute clip from the movie Investigation of Pilot Pirks, trailers(a Russian and an English one for this, The Mirror, Andrei Rubley and Stalker), a 2 minute slideshow and a 2 minute interview with Marina Tarkovskaya(who provides info about Tarkovskiy). I recommend this to anyone who is curious about it(and consider giving it several viewings, or splitting it up to more than one sitting). 10/10",Solaris
17,evanston_dad,Cerebral Sci-Fi,8,5 March 2020,"It's tough to come into a film like ""Solaris"" without tremendous expectations after having heard for so long about its greatness. If you don't immediately feel like it's one of the best movies you've ever seen -- after hearing so many say it is -- you're either tempted to overcompensate and exaggerate how overrated it is out of a sense of defensiveness, or think something's wrong with you for being the only one not to ""get it.""As with most movies that have been saddled with the word ""greatness,"" I understand why ""Solaris"" is considered to be such a watershed movie and so revered by so many, but I have to admit that I didn't personally feel myself responding to it all that much. Maybe I would on a second (or third or fourth) viewing, but I can't say I'm very compelled to watch it again. It's cerebral and philosophical, which I expected, and a bit cold and emotionally uninvolving despite the fact that it's about almost nothing but human emotions and how we react to life's biggest mysteries. I didn't warm much to the characters or ever really think of them as individual human beings so much as necessary conduits for communicating the film's philosophical ruminations. Despite being set in the vast reaches of space, it's a claustrophobic movie, which I think is intentional. We never see space, only the cramped interiors of a spaceship, and that feels right, since the movie is more about the vast universe contained within Man's head than it is about the great physical universe beyond our solar system's borders.What I liked most about ""Solaris"" is that it suggests that Man isn't really developed enough to handle breakthroughs in our understanding of the larger universe. Given the chance to explore space and engage with elements beyond our comprehension, the characters in the movie instead spend all of their time ruminating over and regretting the people they left behind on Earth and the mistakes they made there. It's almost like Mankind turns to solving giant huge mysteries as a distraction from the fact that we're not capable of cracking the lesser, more mundane mysteries of everyday life, like love, commitment, and dependence on one another.""Solaris"" does have one chilling and memorable ending, I'll give it that. If we go poking around in what we don't understand, it seems to say, we may very well find ourselves unable to return to what we do.Grade: A-",Solaris
18,deloudelouvain,Most overrated sci-fi in cinematic history.,2,27 August 2020,"Well this was one of the most overrated movies I ever came across here on IMDb. Why you would rate this movie over eight stars is a complete mystery to me. There are so many things wrong with this movie I can't believe it get such a score. I watched the remake from 2002 with George Clooney and to be honest just give that one a shot instead, as it's more modern, lesser long, and just better in everything. Thie Russian version is first of all way too long (almost three hours of boredom). I don't get why you have to film a lake for more than three seconds, let alone three minutes. It has no point doing that expect boring the audience. I get you want to be artsy but it's not a valid excuse to bombard us with those non-significant images that add absolutely nothing to the story. A story that is by the way interesting in the beginning, a bit intriguing as well, but that turned out to be a snooze fest at one point. Also Russian isn't the nicest language to listen to, I'm not attacking anybody, it's just a fact. I don't understand Italian or Spanish either but those languages have a nice tonality whilst Russian sounds like their about to spit in your face any second. That said while you watch a boring movie it's those kind of tiny details that look amplified and make the movie even worse. I wouldn't say the acting was bad, that was actually the positive note from this movie. The decors on the other hand were quite laughable and amateuristic. The space station is equiped with a library that looks cheap, there is some candlelight shining, they wear clothes like they're about to go partying or hunting, all small details that bring down the credibility of the sci-fi story. To me the whole movie is a mess, whilst the story had huge potential. I was expecting so much of Solaris concidering the high ratings it got, so disappointment is an understatement.",Solaris

20,gbill-74877,A film pondering the limits of man,8,22 August 2018,"Kris Kelvin (Donatas Banionis) arrives at a station hovering above the planet Solaris, which has been studied and debated for years. Its life form, essentially the planet's vast ocean, is very different from anything else encountered or conceived. It seems intelligent, but its actions and the swirling, fantastic structures it can create are hard to decipher. There are new developments following some rogue experiments on the part of some scientists stationed there, which have resulted in the ocean sending ""visitors"" to the station. The visitors are highly personalized to Kelvin and the two men still there (Jüri Järvet and Anatoly Solonitsyn), and conjured from the recesses of their minds. In the case of the others, the visitors are so embarrassing they don't want anyone else to see them. In the case of Kelvin, it's his dead wife (Natalya Bondarchuk), who on Earth poisoned herself after their relationship deteriorated.Is the ocean creating these beings out of some malevolent intention? Once Kelvin figures out it's not really his wife from a few subtle clues, the non-functional buttons on her dress and a fact she knows one of the scientists (but obviously couldn't know him), he reacts with fear, tricking her into a rocket and blasting her into space. However, as the visitors are simply re-spawned when the men sleep, she soon returns, and over time gradually becomes closer and closer to the original. In producing these visitors, is the ocean trying to communicate with humanity in the only way it can? If so, it's doing a better job of it than the other way around, because after decades of study, one scientist simply bombards the ocean with high radiation X-rays, a classic human response - blind, simplistic, and possibly lethal. Is the ocean a type of God, capable of creation? And perhaps a God, as author Stanislaw Lem put it, that is imperfect not because it has human characteristics, such as the ones from the Old Testament or Greek mythology, but because of just how randomly it creates, without understanding the consequences of its acts?If you're looking for clear answers (or a lot of action for that matter), this is not the science-fiction movie for you. In fact, part of its point is to ponder the limits of mankind's understanding. It does this while at the same time reminding us of the need to focus within, understanding mankind and oneself, at least as much as outer space, and creatures we find there. ""We don't need other worlds. We need a mirror,"" one says. Isn't it interesting that they go all that way out into space, find this vast sentient creature that they can't understand, and then end up dealing with things from their own minds? The film also explores the most human of truths. Life is transient, and loss is inevitable - the loss of one's parents, of one's childhood home, of one's loved ones, and of course, of oneself - everything ultimately has its time and passes. It explores the nature of love, and what it means to be happy, even if happiness is artificially created. There is a sentimental and highly personal feeling to the film, amplified by Kelvin's introspection, and not seeing much of the other men's visitors. In the face of all these weighty questions, I absolutely loved this exchange:Dr. Snaut: ""When man is happy, the meaning of life and other eternal themes rarely interest him. These questions should be asked at the end of one's life.""
Kris Kelvin: ""But we don't know when life will end. That's why we're in such a hurry.""
Dr. Snaut: ""Don't rush. The happiest people are those who are not interested in these cursed questions.""All of the actors turn in solid performances, but it was Bondarchuk's performance while gradually gaining self-awareness, becoming despondent, and chastising the men for their cruelty which was most compelling. The scene where she is automatically resuscitated at one point is fantastic. I also liked the brief weightless scene, which had such a lovely ethereal quality to it.I've read that author Stanislaw Lem was not happy with Tarkovsky's adaptation, but I thought it was quite faithful to it, and Tarkovsky really magnified the power of the final scene. One of the flaws in Lem's book that Tarkovsky wisely avoided was too much of the various debates from different camps of scientists studying Solaris over the years. The mind boggles at how long this film might have been had he included it, and the resulting tedium. On the other hand, Tarkovsky's film is flawed as well, in that he is far too deliberate in some of his shots, such as the much-commented-on drive through tunnels in Japan, and several others, mostly in part one. I think his point may have been to show us these things for long enough that we actually start seeing them in another way, as if for the first time, like how we may see something alien for the first time, or may ponder the big questions in life. Regardless, he goes too far, irritating some viewers and causing others to doze off. Even for a film that is highly introspective and philosophical, which probably calls for some of this, pace is an issue here. My advice is to keep an open mind, caffeinate yourself, and stick with it.",Solaris

22,Bored_Dragon,"""When man is happy, the meaning of life and other eternal themes rarely interest him.""",9,12 August 2021,"The film ""Solaris"", by Russian director Andrei Tarkovsky, is based on the eponymous SF novel by Polish writer Stanislaw Lem. I did not read the novel, but its author criticized this adaptation, and Tarkovski himself considered it his weakest achievement.Humans have set up a space station in the orbit of a planet with an indication of extraterrestrial intelligence. However, many years of research do not give any concrete results and the mission is on the verge of shutdown. The station was reduced to only three scientists and, when one of them commits suicide, our protagonist is sent to investigate the case and submit a report on which will depend the further fate of the mission Solaris. It turns out that this mysterious intelligence has the ability to read human minds while they sleep and materialize their ""dreams"".As with the film ""Stalker"", the SF premise is here in the service of the basis for the study of character and strong psychological drama, with the SF element being much more prominent. The premise is very interesting, characters are well developed, both through their actions and through excellently written dialogues, the acting is on a level, and the overall atmosphere is mesmerizing, which is greatly contributed by visual and especially sound effects. Although Tarkovsky did not have a high opinion of Kubrick's masterpiece, the atmosphere of ""Solaris"" reminded me quite a bit of ""2001: A Space Odyssey"".As expected from Tarkovsky, the camera, directing, and editing make ""Solaris"" visually beautiful. But the film contains scenes that last an eternity and, although they look really nice and have a good atmosphere, do not serve any obvious purpose. Neither they contribute to the story, nor to the overall atmosphere or emotion. They are here to be beautiful and to last until exhaustion.The film opens with the scene of our main character strolling, a beautiful scene in which every frame is an art photograph, and without which the film would lose nothing but four minutes of idling. It is soon followed by a scene of Burton driving in the car. For a full five minutes, we watch him in the car and then road through his eyes and then him again and then road from above... So, in the first half-hour, a third is in the same function as Tolstoy's descriptions on five pages. The film could be easily shortened from almost three to under two hours, without losing a bit of story and atmosphere. We would be deprived only of idling, although very nicely shot, but still only idling, which is only there to be beautiful, and along the way to distract everyone from watching except those most patient artistic souls. I'm not saying that all those scenes should be thrown out, but they could be cut in half and the film should still be beautiful and artistic, without risk of suffocating the audience.I'm not able to explain what is in question, but I almost unmistakably recognize movies from the seventies. They have that specific taste that I never particularly liked. Also, after the movie ""Stalker"", I was not optimistic about Tarkovsky's other films. But this one made a really strong impression on me. So much so that, just a few days after watching it in the cinema, I watched it again at home. Except for, in my opinion unnecessary, long idle scenes, ""Solaris"" is in all other respects a beautiful and enriching film experience.9/10.",Solaris

While not quite as visually varied as STALKER, this is due simply to the nature of the story itself and is not a failing of the director. The descent into what may or may not be ""madness"" by the hero seems almost inevitable, and unfolds in ""real time"" in such a manner that the viewer is likewise drawn slowly in.

25,johnnyboyz,"Strangeness abounds on board a Soviet space station; as questions without answers arise and colourless goings-on dominate proceedings, in what is an oddly frustrating film.",6,11 May 2011,"Andrey Tarkovskiy's Solyaris is ultimately a bit of a limp, rather cold and somewhat dreary, albeit worthwhile, piece; a film with a good, healthy idea to it – an intriguing premise revolving around a space station shrouded in mystery and menace, before mutating in this strange love story of sorts spanning a number of years beforehand prior to being suspended for ten, and then rapidly reignited against all odds. The film starts off as a compelling and engrossing little low key drama; ultimately ending up as a philosophy lecture featuring small groups of men standing around attempting to decode life, the universe and everything amidst the odd space-set occurrence and the identified fact that everybody's either gone very mad or that they just shouldn't be anywhere near where they are.Of all places, particularly given where the film will eventually take us, Solyaris begins in the humble and rather lifeless confides of somebody's back garden to a large secluded home. A man, Kris (Banionis), stands idly in his grounds; a pensive and rueful expression on his face as the exterior calm appears to juxtapose his interior thoughts and chaotic feelings. He is a psychologist, his carrying around of a book with him in this rural locale suggesting the desire to retreat to the peace to read already establishing a sense of who he is; his solemn expression it later transpires the result of the death of his wife Hari (Bondarchuk) rather-a long time ago. His 'peace' is spoilt by the arrival of two aeronautical experts, the venturing into his house to talk giving way to further examples of academia on shelves and so forth; one of these two experts, Berton (Dvorzhetsky), laying everything out for both his and our benefit when he cites the predicament regarding the Solyaris situation and where Kris stands in relation to it. One interesting instance during these talks sees Tarkovskiy quite literally have Berton physically turn as conversations swing so as to face a bird cage housing two or so inhabitants; this, as he outlines the position and symptomatically has the scenario that he verbally confirms of the birds trapped in a cage of sorts more broadly map onto that of the astronauts and their predicament, ie; of being trapped in a cage-like situation up in space.Some more detailed analysis arrives in the form of what can only really be likened to a more contemporary home video set up; the playing of a moving image piece on a large domestic screen seeing a younger Berton cite problems from years ago to an array of higher-ups whom appear to dismiss him; the looming presence of a large, propaganda-like picture of an ominous looking bearded man on the wall persistently behind Berton encapsulating a sense of everything this man says being scrutinised and ultimately dismissed as what might come to be a great Soviet space-race breakthrough is warned against.So the planet, or indeed the space-station, or indeed the whole damn situation is given this lengthly; agonising and rather frightening build-up whilst remaining wholly off screen in a physical sense. Kris completes his formalities, says his good-byes and blasts off into orbit so as to dock there in an attempt to figure out why people are acting how they act and why it is very little has progressed in the way of study or news or whatnot. Kris' arrival in his leather jacket-plus-slacks sees the coming of a man looking sharp; smart and like the kind of guy whom gets a job done. His experience in life and exposure to grief or tragedy or whatever ought to place him in good stead, his smarts given what it is he does for a living ought to stack the odds in his favour. We do not question the man's credentials as he cuts as dash around the space station, the 'narrative', if you will, of his clothing and general appearance as the film progresses hand-in-hand with that of the gradually deterioration of his own mental state as he joins the other cosmonauts in psychologically frittering away.If you love your cynical cinematic jabs at science-fiction films, more specifically, those aimed at more contemporary American ones, and that of comparing such things to atmospheric European films of whatever genre, then one will take glee in stating that when Kris arrives into this brooding; delicate and, you'd have to say, rather hostile, situation, what doesn't happen is the letting loose of some kind of creature allowed to take over proceedings on board this unsettling locale so as to turn everything into a bloodbath. Failing a bloodbath, a 'Night of the Body Snatchers'-style narrative in which something physical is playing with the inhabitants and turning everyone doolally. Rather, extended periods of talking and speaking about the predicament and what it is that essentially happens up on that station in regards to the planet, in that it goes into your memory and resurrects the deceased, is the order of the day in what is a film that most certainly requires a certain artistry or guile to it. The film is far from bad, indeed is rather easy to admire in its clinical nature of addressing what it is that it takes on and at its aptness at what it does better than what it doesn't; but the overall coldness to proceedings does enough at times to turn the film into a bit of a chore, Solyaris ultimately an alienating feature running on some good ideas it doesn't really have enough of to justify the runtime and a lack of anything concrete to actually get behind nor zero in on and get involved with.",Solaris
26,howard.schumann,Filled with unforgettable images,9,7 March 2004,"Armed with scientific curiosity, a desire for adventure, and a chauvinistic desire to spread its power to other realms, mankind has always dreamed about traveling to outer space. What is ironic is, as the film Solaris suggests, the journey may only bring us closer to confronting inner space: our fears, regrets, feelings of guilt, and issues of conscience. Based on the novel by Stanislaw Lem, Solaris has been filmed twice: once by the great Russian director Andrei Tarkovsky in 1972 and recently by Steven Soderbergh in a much more condensed version, though the idea can be traced to the 1962 film, Journey to the Seventh Planet. The three-hour plus Tarkovsky version takes place almost entirely within the claustrophobic confines of a space ship but the philosophical space is vast. Tarkovsky's film is exceedingly slow-paced with his trademark long takes, static compositions, and mood of solemnity, yet it contains haunting images of cinematic poetry.Set at an undisclosed time in the future, the film opens with psychologist Kris Kelvin (Donatas Banionis) gazing at a lovely image of underwater reeds rising and falling in cadence. He then visits his estranged father in his countryside home in a fifteen minute sequence that is not present in Lem's novel, but crucial to the film's conclusion. When Burton, a friend of his father, warns Kris of strange happenings on the space station surrounding the oceanic planet Solaris, Kris is sent to investigate. After an extended highway montage of Burton's car ride home that perhaps suggests a road going nowhere, Kris arrives at the space station to find that one of the crew has committed suicide, and the others talking about ghost-like apparitions that resemble dead loved ones. He gradually discovers that the planet they are circling is a living entity, producing exact copies of people extracted from the crew's memory. One of the ""guests"" is Hari (Natalya Bondarchuk), Kris' wife who took her own life. Though able to regenerate herself after being sent on a rocket into space, she slowly begins to take on human characteristics and Kris becomes as attached to her as to the memory of his wife. The character of the psychologist is much less emotional than in the Soderbergh version and the lack of flashbacks makes it difficult to fully appreciate the trauma of Kris' recent past. In a gorgeous scene, Hari discovers a painting by Pieter Bruegel of a village in winter that helps her get in touch with snowy scenes from Kris' childhood, enhancing her development toward being human. As the alien Hari realizes, however, that she can never become the real Hari, she separates herself physically and emotionally from Kris, suggesting that the created memory of the past is more real than the reality of the present. While Tarkovsky's film is plagued with poor editing and other technical difficulties and struggles to amass any cumulative power, it is filled with unforgettable images that remain indelible and a philosophical depth that demands repeat viewing.",Solaris
27,TheMovieDiorama,"Solaris...well, it's something.",7,27 February 2018,"Apparently it's about a cosmonaut visiting the Solaris Space Station where the remaining crew are psychologically disturbed by ""visitors"". An alien presence that materialise from illusory dreams, the cosmonaut dreams of his late wife. He must then decide to submit to Solaris' hallucinogenic gift or stay in reality. Now, before I anger you film elitists and enthusiasts, I understood the film. I acknowledged what it set out to do. Questioning humanity and its existence, throwing in the concept of clinging onto love. I accept that Solaris paved the way for future science fiction cinematic pieces, much like 2001 did. There's no doubt in my mind that Tarkovsky's artistic sensitivity aids in the haunting visceral tone beneath the narrative. Jarring scene transitions of wild foliage, extensive long takes and the dream inspired visuals of Solaris. Natalia Bondarchuk is a revelation and is easily the best performer against a tediously monotonous cast. Artemiev's score was beautifully resonating and suited the atmosphere (or lack of...). With all that said, I struggled. My mind consistently kept switching off as I tried my absolute hardest to stay focussed. It's just too slow for its own good. Possibly one of the slowest films I've ever seen. I'm all for a slow pace in order to evoke a meditative aura within the narrative. But when the script is far too meticulous and constantly preaches about love, 166 minutes feels like an eternity. Needless to say Part Two was slightly more involving that Part One, but I still felt distant from the story. It's far too cold. Ironic considering Tarkovsky claimed Kubrick's '2001' was too sterile. Perhaps I need to adapt to Tarkovsky's signature storytelling methods, I felt the exact same with 'Stalker' being too slow. Critically this film is near faultless with what it sets out to do, but I have to consider my own personal enjoyment which is why I must substantially mark this down. Perhaps on a future viewing I'll become more invested now that I know what I'm getting myself into.",Solaris

29,jzappa,"""Man Needs Man.""",9,14 April 2009,"The intellectual at the helm of this meditative psychodrama, Andrei Tarkovsky, formed a view of cinema that he called ""sculpting in time."" By this he meant that the inimitable feature of the medium is to take our experience of time and diversify it. Unedited movie footage interprets time in real time. By using long takes and few cuts, he aimed to give us a feeling of lost and passing time, and the connection of one moment to another. He also uses water, clouds, and reflections, along with their symbolism, such as waves or the form of brooks or running water. Bells and candles are also widespread indications of film, tonality and vision, and Tarkovsky's adaptation of Stanislaw Lem's Polish novel has a recurrent motif of introspection.Despite its agreed distinctions from 2001: A Space Odyssey, Tarkovsky definitely uses more deeply distinctive characters and a more tempestuous human drama at the center than Kubrick. Notwithstanding, retrospect lets us discern that the two masterworks are more alter egos than contradictions to each other. Both set up their stories in a measured, unhurried style, giving bountiful duration to tracking around the Earth and space sets. Both make use of widescreen mise-en-scène that extracts top-drawer art direction. Both create an atmosphere of mystery that attracts umpteen interpretations.Unlike 2001 nevertheless, Solaris is drenched in somberness, which clinches the film even before it leaves Earth. In this pensive prologue, we see the protagonist, a purposefully detached space psychologist named Kris Kelvin, staring at underwater reeds as though they were the death of a helpless animal. Played by the stoic Donatas Banionis, Kris looks perpetually wounded, slowed by some grief beyond description. His father and aunt worry about his apathy, chide him for his humdrum temperament. He is about to take off the next day for a mission to the space station Solaris, a has-been project which has been left awry: It will be his job to conclude whether or not to close down the research station.Humans seem enslaved by machinery and TV images, disconnected from the nature around them, underwater reeds, a thoroughbred horse, a farm dog. In his persistent shots of freeways, Tarkovsky spurns capturing any but contemporary cars. Why mask the present world in sci-fi apparel, when the alienating future has already barged in?At Solaris, Kris finds a desolate space station, forsaken save for two distracted if not delirious scientists. A colleague Kris had expected to meet has already committed suicide, leaving him a recorded message hinting of vividly imagined Guests who have ""something to do with conscience."" Sure enough, Kris' dead wife Hari substantiates at his side, offering the committed affection for which he is starved. She is played in a mind-blowing performance as one of the most endlessly complicated characters an actor could play. We progress into a dogged inversion of conventions: Real terror is in having to watch someone you love devastate herself, the incapability to protect a loved one, the manifold facades or reappearances of the loved one, the inevitability of repeating past mistakes.The true impact of this cinematic development comes from the agony of Kris' resurrected love for Hari, his eagerness to do anything to hold onto her, even knowing she isn't real. The about-face between color and black and white channels something of this metaphysical inconsistency. Centrally, it's a common love story obstructed by a scientific problem. Hari wonders aloud if she has epilepsy, and later we see her body disturbingly convulsing at the edge between being and non-being. Can he only love her if she is human in the sense that everyone else is? I mean, love is love. An elegant, tranquil levitation sequence, when Kris and Hari lose gravity, conveys another characterized likeness of this supernatural periphery. We humans are used to unattainable love, but can any of us experience inescapable, penetratively unifying love?In the mean time, Tarkovsky thickens the dialogue with provocative assertions about reality, identity, humanity, and sympathy, reinforced by citations of civilization's rivets like Bach, Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky, Goethe, Brueghel, Luther, and Cervantes. The Soviet censors may have been pacified by the lack of the word God, but Tarkovsky takes the customary science- fiction theme of spacemen determining ""contact"" with other phenomenons of intelligence, and enhances it virtually to juxtaposition with absolute being through the alien planet's ocean with its cognizant Chthonic functions, embodied by literal islands of thought. Indeed, the planet in question is a symbol for something the contemporary human condition is not able to understand or accept.",Solaris

I though it was an okay film, but even then I though that the director Andrei Tarkovsky was a bit too fond of his long takes and he's stilted closeups. But, that's the man's style. His movies care more about the mood than what's actually happening on the screen.Solaris is based on a novel by the same name by Stanislaw Lem. It's quite a fine book. Not one of my favourites or anything, but if you're talking about the classics of science fiction, it has earned its rightful place. It's a long, pondering look at the problems of space exploration, while also being a worthwhile discussion about the morality of guilt. The actual plot following Kris Kelvin, a psychologist sent to Solaris, a distant and mysterious planet, which the mankind has attempted to research for decades. With no discernible results. But now something has changed and it just might be that the planet is researching the humans instead.The story has some good material for a movie. A psychological thriller, for example, that also explores the themes of guilt, morality of science and the potential for mankind to spread across the cosmos. But in Tarkovsky's hands we get a very loose collection of scenes full of closeups of suffering human faces, long takes of nature, with the added bonus of long, pondering breaks and held camera poses.Apparently Tarkovsky himself was not all that pleased with the film. He wanted to revolutionize the genre of science fiction, but couldn't pull it off, according to his own words. He lamented that he had to compromise his artistic vision by including plot-driven dialogue and scenes with special effects.So why direct a science fiction movie at all, then?",Solaris
31,jamesrupert2014,"Slow-moving and cryptic, perhaps brilliant but not very entertaining",7,23 April 2019,"In this adaptation of Russian science fiction author Stanislaw Lem's eponymous novel, psychologist Kris Kelvin (Donatas Banionis) is sent to a space-station observing the water-covered planet 'Solaris' to investigate strange messages being sent back to Earth by the three-man crew. When he arrives, he finds one crewman dead and the other two convinced that there are other people, ""guests"" as they call them, aboard the station who are manifestations of their subconscious memories generated by the living planet below. Kelvin is skeptical until his long-dead wife Hari (Natalya Bondarchuk) appears in his quarters. Be prepared: Andrei Tarkovsky's film is polarising, some viewers (and many critics) compare 'Solaris' to '2001: A Space Odyssey' (1968) as one of the greatest science-fiction movies ever made, others condemn it as an overly-long, boring exercise in non-expository story telling (especially those who view the film after being assured that it is a masterpiece). The scenes on the Solaris station are excellent as is the acting (admittedly reading subtitles, as I did, is a step away from listening to the characters), but the opening scenes are very slow (especially the interminable drive through Tokyo substituting for either a future Moscow or a fictional city). The theme underlying Lem's book is the difficulty (or impossibility) of communication with, or even remotely understanding, a completely alien mind, so viewers expecting an explanation (or even a lucid hint) of what is happening to the crew or of the nature of the ostensibly 'sentient ocean' will be disappointed (as will anyone expecting graceful dockings of spaceships in magnificent spinning space-stations), and (IMO) the final scene is as unsatisfyingly cryptic as the end of Kubrick's opus. 'Solaris' is an interesting film but not an entertaining film and is a 'must-see' (actually or expectedly) for fans of the genre, especially those who think that they'd still like '2001' without HAL or the landmark special effects.",Solaris
32,Polaris_DiB,Just my kinda thing...,9,20 September 2005,"If it's long, drawn out, and doesn't make a lick of sense, it has a special place in my heart.I write this review after the first viewing, which means it's probably not a good one as this is one of those movies that requires multiple viewings so that things start falling into place. Years of Lynch and Kubrick movies have taught me to take the first watch a little easily, and to let things come together on their own accord in subsequent viewings.Thus, the surface review: Solaris is a project. Somewhere in space and time exists an Ocean (capitalized) which has a manned satellite studying it. Historically, this scientific mission has been controversial because not only has it completely failed to progress, it actually tends to digress scientific progress and cause the scientists on the duty to sometimes as much as go insane.A psychologist named Kris Kelvin (played by somebody whose name I could never hope to pronounce or spell) goes to the satellite after one of the remaining three scientists (in a station built for 85) kills himself. There he meets Hari, his dead ex-wife. Romance, philosophy, and the meaning of life ensues, revolving around the significant ""Other"" (this time related as a significant other, haha) so important to science fiction.This movie is very thick, and very Russian. Being that it's like a Russian 2001: A Space Odyssey, I feel pretty safe in saying, ""This isn't for everyone."" However, if it sounds right up your alley, here's the things you can come to expect: 1) Beautiful imagery. Absolutely amazing from frame one to last moment.2) Great directing. I can see why this guy's mentioned almost as much as Eisenstein when someone brings up the subject ""Russian directors."" 3) Creepiness. Mirrors, stuff moving out of the corner of your eye, all that stuff that keeps the relatively slow exposition rather harrowing for the viewer sitting there thinking, ""It's just a simple matter of WHAT THE HECK IS GOING ON?""

Lem stated.... In other words - Tarkovsky's film ruined the whole essence and philosophical flow of Lem's book.And, after seeing this grossly over-rated disappointment for myself - I couldn't agree more with Lem in his utter outrage towards Tarkovsky and his precious, little picture.",Solaris

But the uncut version of this already dense, metaphysical sci-fi parable (drastically cut by its first American distributor in the early 1970s) at least restores some narrative clarity (if no actual answers) to the Stanislaw Lem story of a sentient ocean planet and its unnerving effect on the crew of an orbiting space station. It's ironic that Tarkovsky's most popular feature was the director's least favorite of his own films. Outer space clearly held less interest to him than the mysteries of inner space, but his attempt to work in such a well-worn (and for this filmmaker, totally unlikely) genre resulted in a challenging speculative fiction light years away from the hardware and hustle of a George Lucas adventure, probing the cosmos with deeper insight than even Stanley Kubricks '2001', and with a surprising economy of distracting effects.

35,GiraffeDoor,It perfectly does what it tries to do. A movie to lose yourself in and find yourself again.,8,18 July 2019,"A long, leisurely and hypnotic picture with an obscure message and a lot of heavy conversations.It does not dive into its plot so be prepared for a lot of contemplative scenes where we just admire the sets. It might be about the nature of loss or about the futility of meaning or whatever.A cool, aloof tone keeps this movie watchable. Superb sets, stoic acting, mystical visualisation with plenty of excellent things to look at (and all the time you need to take them in) make this a cinematic experience like no other.Admittedly kind of lugubrious but there is something of great beauty in the middle of this that justifies everything. This was not made to appeal to the people who pick movies based on who's acting in them or who are OK with Schindler's List being in English (incidentally this is based on a Polish Novel but is in Russian but that's totally different), it's a professionally made and artistically airtight, yet unpretentious, examination of something that is hard to verbalize.If you have the energy, patience, attentiveness and openness for this movie it will pay you back in spades.Just find a night where you're totally free and in the mood to be challenged.",Solaris
36,Lechuguilla,Have A Pillow Handy,2,9 October 2008,"Has there ever been a slower film? Whatever vision or theme director Andrei Tarkovsky was trying to convey, almost certainly more viewers would have been exposed to it and possibly mesmerized, if the film had been imbued with a modicum of entertainment value. ""Solyaris"" has got to be one of the most boring, and pretentious, movies ever made.Ostensibly a sci-fi film, the first 43 minutes take place in a most mundane, earth-like setting, with visuals that do not in any way suggest anything cosmic or other-worldly. Later, the plot shifts to a spacecraft. But even here, the sets are mundane and unimaginative. They look like what one would see in an episode of Star Trek.None of the film's characters are remotely interesting. Dialogue and acting are both melodramatic. At times, I thought I was watching a soap opera. The film has absolutely no humor. The overall tone is serious and dour. Background music is funereal and gloomy. The film's first Act is confusing and muddled.The cinematography has very, very long camera ""takes"", and is mostly color, but shifts to B&W at odd times, for no apparent reason. Five consecutive minutes are consumed by a car traversing a freeway in Japan (and this is a Russian film?); there's no dialogue in this sequence, nothing but a car moving along through a city, first in daylight, then at night. Nor does the sequence advance the plot in any discernible way. Throughout the film, sound effects are amplified, apparently to keep viewers awake.With a ponderous and painfully slow plot that runs nearly three hours, no humor, melodramatic dialogue and acting, and an abstruse theme, ""Solyaris"" comes across not only as tedious and utterly lacking in entertainment value, but also extremely pretentious. For most viewers, I would recommend a pillow or a deck of cards. One should at least be able to get in a lengthy nap or several games of solitaire for having to endure this dreary cinematic ordeal.",Solaris
37,rooprect,Skip this. See KIN-DZA-DZA instead.,3,7 January 2007,"Admit it. 9 out of 10 of you are here because you heard that this movie is better than 2001: A Space Odyssey. Or perhaps there's some jerk who keeps putting you down every time you talk about scifi because you haven't seen Solyaris. Of all the phony name-dropping that goes on in scifi, this tops the list.Well, I'm here to tell you that you don't have to sumbit. You want obscure Russian scifi that has a subtle yet poignant political/social commentary? Go see a film called KIN-DZA-DZA (1986). You want artistic science fiction which will confound your senses whilst piquing your consciousness? Go see MAN WHO FELL TO EARTH (1976). But for Chrissake, give this overrated flick a rest.But if you must... well, OK. I'll give you some pointers on how to watch (endure) this picture. Try not to get annoyed by 7 minutes of closeups of pond scum. Resist the temptation to hurl things at the screen after watching 11 minutes of freeway footage. And don't puke when you see a meaningless, 3-minute closeup of a man's ear. Yes, I'm sure these scenes are all wrought with esoteric symbolism. But that doesn't change the fact that they are overindulgent wastes of film.If, at any time during the picture, you need to get up, use the restroom or fix yourself a peanut butter sandwich, feel free to do so without hitting 'pause'. Chances are the same scene will be on the screen when you return.The plot itself is interesting but slightly flawed. But perhaps by that point you're too busy pondering the socio-political significance of a man's earlobe to notice the flaws. The ending, yes, is quite memorable. So don't throw this film in the trash without fast forwarding to the ending. But then again, if you're familiar with the old Twilight Zone series, perhaps you'll be able to figure out the ending without wasting your time looking at algae.The theme--well, here I actually have something positive to say. The theme is quite compelling, thought-provoking and ponderous. I assume that's why this film has warranted such a bloated rating on IMDb. Fair enough. But for all its poetry, this movie still did not give me an enjoyable experience. It was like listening to a very intelligent person speak in monotone, repeating himself ad nauseum.

40,I_Ailurophile,"Excellent, contemplative sci-fi drama",7,13 August 2021,"Andrei Tarkovsky is a great filmmaker, with a keen eye for fine shots and camerawork, and arranging some outstanding scenes. Sometimes marvelous consideration of lighting gives scenes a sense of familiar warmth, sad regret, or jarring stress simply by altering the overall hue of the image. Pair this was gorgeous filming locations and or swell set design, dazzling effects, and careful costume design and makeup, and the visuals in his movies are consistently captivating. Then there's the music composed by Eduard Artemyev - mostly very subtle in its ambience as it accompanies each scene, but always lending to the mood. It's also well worth mentioning the performances here, as the cast demonstrates great acting skills. Though broadly even and steady in his portrayal of Kris Kelvin, Donatas Banionis capably depicts the swirling confusion and disorientation of the protagonist. I'm particularly enamored of Natalya Bondarchuk, whose role as Hari demands strong emotional range for an especially complex character.'Solaris' feels relatively straightforward, a movie with greater emphasis on narrative and characters than on artistry in its craft, or on subtle and open-ended interpretations - though to be sure there is much to appreciate here in every regard. Among other things, there is exploration of the limitations of human understanding - of ourselves, and just as surely of things outside ourselves. There are reflections, too, on human nature: how we define humanity; how we approach ethics, sentiment, sentience, knowledge. Of course, art is subjective, and someone else may easily take another view. With that said, despite the marginally less ambiguous nature of this feature, I find 'Solaris' somewhat difficult to engage with. Maybe it's just me, but there's a persistent feeling of something missing - not quite enough energy poured into the narrative, or the artistry, or the underlying notions, or the performances. As a result the picture feels almost imperceptibly ""off."" Though, to be fair, this impression of a nebulous defect also seems weirdly appropriate to the story on hand.By no means is 'Solaris' a film for a general audience. Any tension or suspense is slow and creeping if present at all, and despite sparse, acutely jolting moments, the feature is generally quiet and low-key. It's an open-minded, patient viewer who will best admire what Tarkovsky has offered us. For anyone willing to sit and stew with 'Solaris,' and try to grasp its nuances, this is an excellent movie very much worth seeking out.",Solaris
41,rbverhoef,Beautiful images in a slow but interesting story,8,7 April 2004,"The original 'Solaris' from director Andrei Tarkovsky is almost twice as long as the 2002 remake from Steven Soderbergh, which is a good thing for the movie but a bad thing for most audiences. If you have seen the remake and found it too slow, too boring, then you must not watch the original. I didn't find the movie boring, although I have to admit there are scenes that seem to go on forever, one with a freeway in particular.The story is about a planet named Solaris and a space station in an orbit around it. Strange things are happening on the station so Kris Kelvin (Donatas Banionis) goes there to investigate certain things. There are supposed to be three other people on the station. One of them has died, one of them Dr. Sartorius (Anatoli Solonitsyn) at first doesn't want to talk with him and one of them Dr. Snaut (Jüri Järvet) does tell him things but is a little vague about what is happening. After Kris' first night on the station his late wife (Natalya Bondarchuk) wakes up next to him. Although this is not his real wife but something created by Solaris from Kris his own memories he sees her as his wife. Now that Kris has a Guest, like Sartorius and Snaut, Sartorius wants to talk with him about the events, about Solaris and about its creations. It is not that Kris' wife is only seen by him. Sartorius and Snaut see her too and they even talk with her. She has intelligence although she only knows what Kris knows about her since that is what Solaris knows from him.It is hard to explain exactly what the movie shows us and even tells us. The ending makes sure that we are even more unsure. Of course I will not reveal it but it makes the movie even more interesting. The most interesting thing is how Kris responds to his Guest. He knows she is not his real wife, she even knows it, but still she loves that what he sees.Like I said, there are very slow parts in the movie. Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey' also has the slow moments but there the images and the beautiful classical music keep us interested and fascinated. 'Solaris' doesn't have the music but the images are there to enjoy as well. The movie could have been shorter but because it takes the time to explore things we can take the time to think about that while enjoying some great images. You should give it a try.",Solaris
42,truemythmedia,One of the More Truly Unique Sci-Fi Films I've Seen,8,1 November 2019,"I wanted to love this movie the first time I watched it. I didn't.I wanted to realize how wrong I was about it as I watched it for the second time. I didn't.The bottom line is that, while I like this movie a great deal, I do not love it like I love other Tarkovsky films.The first reason for this, I think, is the setting. The film is set in an ambiguous future which, like many imagined futures in film, looks quite dated and strange in many ways. Some of the strangeness plays into the themes of the movie but there is a small part of me that just can't handle watching a rocket shoot off in a closed room and not have it kill someone standing nearby. It's the same part of me that can't look at the candelabras in the library and wonder how they manage to burn a wick without setting the entire station on fire.As much as I love Tarkovsky for his meditative style, I honestly feel like he pushes it a little with ""Solaris."" Even I, and I'm no fidgety teenager, had trouble sitting through some of the longer meditative scenes and not wandering in my mind a bit.All that being said, I really enjoy the rest of this film. The concept is quite bold and unique, especially for a sci-fi film which would normally focus on the harder science aspects of space travel or biological aspects of alien life. To make a film which is almost exclusively interested in discussions surrounding the nature of conscience, individuality, and societal identity takes extraordinary courage. I imagine a film like this would be roughly received by general audiences in its day and even more so today.However, Tarkovsky is interested in whatever he is interested in and makes no apologies for it. That is not to say that he leaves his audience with no handholds. He certainly allows his characters to fully live out and explain their emotions and thoughts despite the fact that they ay not always make a lot of sense the first time through. With repeat viewing however, you realize the depth of background he has built into every scene. The architecture of the house and where it is located says something and is actually important to the main character's psyche, though it is never discussed, just as the layout and endless nature of the station lends and air of eternal mystery to the entire film.So what is the film about? I find sometimes I try so hard to obfuscate the facts of the film in order to avoid spoilers that I say almost nothing at all about the movie. It's about what makes us human as it relates to memory. It's about the people we form in our heads from our perceptions of others, whether they bear any resemblance to reality or not. It's about scientific exploration and its limits as we run up against potential limitations or difficult choices when it comes to life or unexplained phenomena.In a way, I suppose it is about wonder, love, monotony, and death. It is a film that makes a real effort to give its viewers a door through which to walk through and into thoughts which we do not entertain very frequently. That is enough for me to give this challenging film at least a third viewing.",Solaris
43,davidmvining,Russians...in SPACE!,10,11 October 2021,"Fresh off the uncomfortable release of Andrei Rublev (actually, in the middle of it since it didn't actually get an official Soviet release until 1973), Andrei Tarkovsky went safe. He chose to adapt the work of a popular Polish Soviet science fiction writer, Stanislaw Lem, and hoped that it would help his career. Despite working closely with Lem, Tarkovsky ended up making a work that Lem hated, saying that the adaptation missed the point and that his novel wasn't about the erotic problems of astronauts. His book was about the limits of human reason, an idea that Tarkovsky certainly does touch on, but the emphasis seems to be more about the struggles of communication with a superior force. I think it's easy to see why, even if the film is great in its own right, Lem would reject it ultimately (as well as the Soderbergh film from 2002).At some point in the future, a field of study called Solaristics has become moribund. The science is the study of the planet Solaris, a living planet with oceans and an atmosphere that defies explanation. The effort to study it came to a halt some decades before when a pilot, Berton (Vladislav Dvorzhetsky) saw things on a flight through the atmosphere that sounded absolutely insane. He saw giant children without spacesuits, and islands that appeared and disappeared. Funding got pulled, but the space station in orbit remained. Into the story comes Kris Kelvin (Donatas Banionis), a psychologist being sent to Solaris to speak with the final three residents of the station and make a judgment about whether to remove the station from orbit or allow it to stay.The first forty-five minutes of this film are set firmly on Earth as Berton comes to Kelvin's remote country home to show him video of his testimony, and it's very important to the film. The film gives us a very firm grounding emotionally, visually, and aesthetically that makes the alien world of Solaris and the metallic interior of the station all the more foreign to our senses. The most important visual is of reeds underneath the surface of the small pond behind the house, flowing with the motion of the water. This comes back later when Kelvin puts up a paper with cuts in it against an air vent in the station to replicate the sound of nature in the stolid environment, and it provides a visual link to his home back on Earth at the same time.The narrative importance of the early scenes are around establishing the history of Solaris and the science but also to give Kelvin time with Berton who insists that the things he saw were truly there. Kelvin, the sceptic, is completely unopen to hearing it. There's no way that the things Berton saw could be true.The station itself is an incredible product of design with red walls, steely floors, and an abandoned look that feels authentic. Upon arriving, Kris discovers that the one of the three that he actually knew, Dr. Gibarian (Sos Sargsyan), has committed suicide, and the other two, Dr. Sartorius (Anatoly Solonitsyn) and Dr. Snaut (Juri Jarvet) won't really talk about it. Also, there seem to be other people on the station, especially a young woman who flits around corners just outside of Kris' view. He quickly learns that these visions of other people are ""guests"", manifestations of the dead from the subconscious of the scientists. Dr. Snaut calmly informs Kris that he will receive one as well once he goes to sleep. That prediction comes true, and it's Kris' dead wife, Hari (Natalya Bondarchuk).Kris is so terrified of the vision, that he quite literally immediately tricks this resurrected version of his wife into climbing into a rocket on the station and launching her into space. It's no use since she comes back, appearing fully formed with a new shawl to match the one Hari I left behind, the next night when he goes to sleep. Realizing that he can't get rid of her, Kris accepts her presence to a certain extent, and tries to go on with his work. Hari II, though, is so intimately tied to Kris that she can't stand being outside of his presence, going so far as to break through the door to the quarters when he leaves for just a moment.Is Hari II human? Is she just a manifestation? Is she real? As she lives longer, she becomes more independent and thoughtful, but ultimately this is Kris' journey. His is about connecting with Hari II as much as he would connect with the original, his real wife, ultimately saying that Hari II is as real as the original ever was. I can see how Lem might find that this goes too far in a direction he didn't intend. And yet, it's not really about Kris reconnecting with his dead wife. Hari II is a manifestation of Solaris, and ultimately it's about a higher level of intelligence learning to communicate with a lower one, digging into the subconscious of Kris and finding the woman he had loved as the most appropriate conduit. And yet, the communication remains incomplete. What one wants from the other gets lost in emotion, creating imprecision rather than clarity.Hari II represents Kris' past, and he ultimately doesn't want to part from it. Instead of focusing on his mission, he decides to stay on the station forever with Hari II. It's a regression for him. Everything comes to a sudden end when Dr. Sartorius beams Kris's brain pattern down to Solaris, providing the most direct communication possible, and Hari II leaves a note filled with mournful sadness at the necessary parting between her and Kris, in no small part because Solaris is realizing how much it's hurting the humans made all the worse by Hari II's insistence at her own reality (made all the worse by a suicide attempt that kills her but she recovers from because she's not actually human but an extension of Solaris).Being an extremely Russian movie, the film occasionally moves into philosophical discussions between the characters about the nature of reality. The central occasion of this happens in the station's library, the only room that feels like something back on earth with deep mahogany shelves, tables, and chairs stuffed with books and several paintings, most notably The Hunters in the Snow by Pieter Bruegel the Elder. These kinds of sequences work to help enhance the film because Tarkovsky uses them as extensions of themes and characters. It's how his intelligent characters often communicate, and at the heart of the discussion is Hari II, before her suicide attempt. There's acrimony especially from Dr. Sartorius while Dr. Snaut has a more laid back attitude to the guests, having found an uneasy kind of peace with the invasion.There are also moments that presage what Tarkovsky would end up doing in the entirety of his next film, Mirror, moments of disconnected imagery designed to help illuminate the inner life of Kris. Late in the film, while regarding The Hunters in the Snow, he thinks back to his life on Earth, especially centered around his mother who seems to have died young, and this sort of intimate connection that he had left behind, made worse by the reality of how his relationship with the original Hari had ended with her suicide after a fight with Kris' mother, eats at him on the inside.For a slow-moving movie, Solaris has a lot going on. It's a dense, intelligent film that uses emotional storytelling to explore a more intellectual concept. It's also a film really designed for a certain set of cinematic tastebuds. Yes, it's science-fiction, but it's so far from what most people think of science fiction as to essentially be another genre. I don't enjoy playing genre labeling games, so it's existence somewhere between drama, fantasy, science-fiction, and Russian epic doesn't bother me. I find Solaris a hypnotic voyage into the unknown where man meets something far larger than himself and simply does not know how to communicate with it, his own concerns ultimately preventing him from understanding that which is so much more. In some ways it reminds me of Arthur C. Clarke's ""child race"" motif from his science-fiction novels, but told in a much more humane manner, finding empathy with Kris where Clarke would likely have found scorn.",Solaris
44,Spleen,Obviously there's something about Tarkovsky I'm missing...,7,1 December 2001,"...and in this case I can tell what it is: the words.  I'm told that in Russian the dialogue is lovely; in the English translation I read, it was boring and flat; half of what people said wasn't translated (the lines that were ignored weren't at all trivial), the printed words were out of sync with the spoken ones, and the metaphysical musings towards the end, which may not have been trite in Russian, ADVERTISED the fact that they were trite in English.  Surely it can't be THAT hard to find someone fluent in both English and Russian?  If the wretched subtitles on the print I saw are the best available, no English speaker has yet seen the true ""Solaris"".Mind you, this doesn't fully account for my falling asleep.  The thing is, no other director who has ever lived is as good as Tarkovsky at making me want to doze off (to be fair, I had no such temptation during ""Andrei Rublyov"").  It's not that he's slow.  I don't know how to measure cinematic speed, but films like ""2001"" and ""Death in Venice"" at least FEEL every bit as slow as Tarkovsky - and for all that, they're riveting.  Something about Tarkovsky's rhythms or visual cues or SOMETHING makes my metabolism wind down and my eyelids feel heavy, however much I tell myself that the film is interesting.  Perhaps it's just a quirk of my nervous system, like the tendency some people have to sneeze when they look into the sun.  (N.B.:  I saw ""Solaris"" once on video and once in a cinema; I fell asleep briefly each time, but during different bits, so I did end up seeing the whole thing.)Clearly, the man's images are beautiful, and (allowing for the mistranslation) this is a fine script; there are even at least two pure, electrifying moments (the one involving the rocket and the one involving the island, not to give anything away).  But ... well, obviously I'm not going to trust my critical judgment very far here, given the appalling subtitles, but I note that once again Tarkovsky has decided to mix colour and black and white footage for the sheer, dubious joy of doing so.  I'm certain this is a mistake.  Many films mix colour with black and white; to my knowledge, only three are successful (each in a different way - the three are ""A Matter of Life and Death"", ""Pleasantville"", and, ironically, ""Andrei Rublyov"").  All the others should stop fooling around and decide once and for all which they are to be.This has not been a review.  I doubt that ""Solaris"" is as great as people say it is - you'd think a great film, especially one so visually attractive, would communicate more of its greatness, poor subtitles or no.

45,Amyth47,Stalker in Space...!,10,24 September 2018,"My Rating : 10/10 ♠ MASTERPIECE ♠I loved Solaris. It is a deeply affecting Soviet science fiction film from the master himself, Tarkovsky. Now Tarkovsky's films are akin to a painting and due to its leeway to be a bit pretentious you are open to interpret as you wish as your understanding may change with time.Solaris is practically Stalker in space or Stalker is Solaris on Earth (since Solaris came before Stalker)...The film ponders the limits of mankind's understanding. It does this while at the same time reminding us of the need to focus within, understanding mankind and oneself, at least as much as outer space, and creatures we find there. ""We don't need other worlds. We need a mirror,"" one says. Isn't it interesting that they go all that way out into space, find this vast sentient creature (the ocean) that they can't understand, and then end up dealing with things from their own minds?This is not an action film. It is a slow, sometimes painfully slow, story which creative and thinking types will appreciate. If you are not the creative, artistic soul (why are you reading my reviews then? no, just kidding) then stick to Terminator or Matrix or Aliens.A dialogue which is introspective goes thus:Dr. Snaut: ""When man is happy, the meaning of life and other eternal themes rarely interest him. These questions should be asked at the end of one's life."" Kris Kelvin: ""But we don't know when life will end. That's why we're in such a hurry."" Dr. Snaut: ""Don't rush. The happiest people are those who are not interested in these cursed questions.""This is a beautiful, damaged science fiction film albeit more seance than science and more premonition than fiction.",Solaris

47,fntstcplnt,Solaris (1972),8,12 August 2019,"Directed by Andrei Tarkovsky. Starring Donatas Banionis, Jüri Järvet, Natalya Bondarchuk, Anatoli Solonitsyn, Vladislav Dvorzhetsky, Nikolai Grinko, Sos Sargsyan, Olga Barnet.Psychologist Banionis is sent to a deteriorating space station studying a mysterious planet called Solaris to determine the suitability of the crew and the mission after they report strange incidents and hallucinations; not long after arriving, Banionis is forced to accept their altered reality and is even visited by his dead wife. Long, slow, contemplative science fiction film cares little about technology or otherworldly explanation and focuses instead on allegory, metaphysics, the resonance and impact on the human psyche and our emotional frailties (less Arthur C. Clarke than Ingmar Bergman). Will test the patience of some viewers, mesmerize and reward others; it's sometimes too talky (and takes too long in the setup before getting Banionis out to the space station), but possesses an unmistakable hypnotic quality that grabs hold after the first hour or so and refuses to let go.85/100",Solaris
48,Cosmoeticadotcom,Excellent,9,18 September 2008,"I first saw the 2002 Steven Soderbergh version of Solaris, starring George Clooney, then read Stansislaw Lem's novel, then watched this- Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 169 minute film version of the book, Solaris (Solyaris), which won the Grand Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival that year, and each successive interpretation I've seen of the work is better than the last, even though Lem publicly disavowed Tarkovsky's film, which was scripted by Fridrikh Gorenshtein. The book is a good piece of sci fi, but it's not great, not that long, its philosophizing not nearly as deep as that which Tarkovsky explores, and is told in the first person, unlike the two film versions, which sometimes gives away too much of the dramatic arc of the tale. Still, Tarkovsky hews closer to the Lem novel than Soderbergh, and Lem apparently forced him to do so, by contract. The film (really both) does make a bit more sense if you've read the book, but the parts that are left inexplicable are fine in a film like this, one that is not about details, but the 'big picture'.The Russian film version has some problems- mainly the ineffective use of black and white scenes interspersed with the color at moments that do nothing to justify the dreamier feel of black and white- although there are a few standout colorless scenes; and scenes of a 'futuristic city'- seemingly shot in the Far East, which just looks like any metropolitan city of the 1970s, and was dated even upon the film's release. Another visual flaw is an early scene on earth where a rainstorm is clearly not occurring, for the raindrops are seen only in the foreground of the screen- there is no realistic visual 'depth' to the storm. All of these are minor, and given this film's limited budget, not really something to worry over. Aside from those flaws, however, the film has rightfully earned its comparisons to Stanley Kubrick's great 1968 film, 2001: A Space Odyssey, despite a recent spate of critics who have tried to point out the differences between the two films. While these exist, as in any films, the similarities are far greater and deeper than any handful of differences. Yet, this film also has as much in common with another Russian film, from a decade earlier, and also reputedly adapted from a Lem novel- 1962's black and white Planeta Burg (Planet Of Storms), which was later bought by Roger Corman for American release, and recut first into Journey To The Prehistoric Planet, and later the Mamie Van Doren schlock film Journey to the Planet Of Prehistoric Women. While Lem never acknowledged the similarities between those two versions of two of his works, he publicly disdained Kubrick's approach. But his claim that 2001 was inhuman says far more of Tarkovsky's limits as an artist than Kubrick's. Yes, there are elements of suggesting that a state of happiness obviates the human desire for questioning, but we can also see the final scene as that not of a human submission to a higher power, but of a human conquest. This is also in league with interpretations of 2001's ending, which similarly has been seen as a human submission to a higher race of beings, rather than a human triumph over mystery, for the Solaris Ocean- with a deeper knowledge of Kelvin and humanity, may now be tamed, perhaps lulled or narcotized, and willing to merely serve up fantasies for its human visitors- as a sort of sentient, futuristic, and extraterrestrial Disneyworld. This hearkens back to an earlier posit in the film, where the men argue over whether humans really want to conquer the cosmos, as they explore outer space, or only want to extend the earth to its ends, which ties into the motto of William Cameron Menzies pre-World War Two sci fi classic film, Things To Come, and its insistence that man must conquer all that lays before him, lest not really be human. Whether or not this, or any other posits that films make need be true is not the point, for art is not philosophy, which is simply about inert ideas. Art is about ideas in motion, ideas put into the service of communication, and as such, Solaris succeeds about as well as any other film that's ever appeared on screen. And, if one is not quite sure what the ideas it has are, there's little doubt that how it is served is memorable, and in that regard, art does conquer all, even if the men that create it might falter.",Solaris

50,mstomaso,Islands of Memory Made Flesh,10,11 April 2008,"Sergei Tarkovsky's Solyaris is one of my all-time favorite science fiction films, but it is not for everybody. Based on a novel by brilliant Polish-Soviet Imaginative Fiction author Stanislaw Lem, Solyaris is an intensely philosophical sojourn into inner and outer space. It is also a lengthy, beautiful and very eastern European film. Solaris capture the stoic and sometime nihilistic imagination of Lem, but very little of his quirky sense of humor. Instead, the film is an intense, brooding examination of the conflict and dualism of the human urge to explore and possess the limits of knowledge and being.Kris Kelvin (Donatus Banionus) is a psychologist who is sent to the research station in orbit around the planet Solaris to prepare its crew for the station's shut down. Solaris, however, is not just a planet, but rather a living, evolving neural net, and the mission of the various scientists (Solarists) who have been studying it for decades is to understand and make contact. The earth-side administration for this project has become frustrated with the fact that the Solarists do not seem to be able to force a 'breakthrough', but it seems that Solaris itself has been reaching out in its own way. The story focuses on Kelvin's metamorphosis, but this is really just a vehicle for Lem's multitude of philosophical points. While intellectually brilliant, the film could not approach the philosophical scope of Lem's lucid but dense writing. Those who want to explore his ideas on extraterrestrial intelligence, the human condition, progress, etc, should read the book - after seeing the movie(s).The cinematography is absolutely superb. Each shot is a work of art. The acting is very good and very consistent - none of the actors falter and Natalya Bondarchuk (Hari) and Juri Jarvet (Dr. Snaut) are particularly mesmerizing. The pace may be a bit difficult - particularly for American audiences - but don't even start with this film if you are not willing to invest in it - it's not an easy film and it is well worth expending a bit of patience. Since this IS Sci Fi, I feel obligated to mention the special effects. They are appropriate to the subject matter - never overdone, and certainly not the focus of the film. Stephen Soderbergh's Americanized version of Solyaris http://pro.imdb.com/title/tt0307479/usercomments is one of the few Americanizations of a foreign film which does justice to the original, but still, Tarkovsky's film is the better of the two. What Soderbergh did particularly well was to translate Solaris from Soviet/Eastern European to American cultural contexts. This involved dialog changes, characterization and a few subtle plot changes. Although both films focus heavily on the central male character, Soderbergh's film proportionally spends more time with Clooney to the detriment of his fellow Solarists. Perhaps the most noticeable plot change is the fact that Tarkovsky's film explains itself fairly early on as the scientists discuss the nature of the phenomena Solaris appears to cause, while in Soderbergh's film, the mysteries are retained for a bit longer. Finally, Tarkovsky's film is a work of art, and although Soderbergh's technique is very good, Tarkovsky's cinematography is unusually powerful. Every scene is picture-perfect. Both films are highly recommended, but only for patient and thoughtful Sci Fi and drama fans. If you're not sure, you may want to try Soderbergh's version first.",Solaris
51,brchthethird,Glacially paced but philosophically rich,8,5 January 2015,"Having just finished watching this, there are a lot of things going through my head. Despite being rather dense, I was able to understand the film on at least a surface level although there was definitely a lot more going on beneath the surface. The story, which is rather difficult to describe, is about a psychologist who visits a space station orbiting a planet called Solaris in order to figure out why the remaining crew are insane. However, once there he begins to be affected by the same thing that they are. As a sci-fi film, this is probably one of the most philosophical I've ever seen, with the sci-fi elements pushed back as far as possible. Prepare yourself for heady discussions about ethics and morality in science, memory, love, and what it means to be human. Also prepare for a glacial, but deliberate, pace. I usually don't care about the pacing so much as long as I enjoy what I'm watching. I'd say that I admire this film more than I like it, but I can still appreciate the superb filmmaking on display as well as the rich and heady themes that it tackles. All of the performances are excellent, although I'm not the best judge of Russian acting since I've seen precious few Russian films. This is my first foray into Tarkovsky, and from what I got here I'll definitely be returning to his filmography again, maybe to this one at a later point. Overall, I would recommend this if you don't mind slow pacing and being required to put serious thought into what you're watching. SOLARIS is definitely a classic, but it won't be to everyone's tastes.",Solaris
52,gizmomogwai,Mind-bending masterpiece of dreams and delusions,10,9 June 2012,"While in the West Stanley Kubrick's 2001 (1968) remains the thinking man's preferred alien movie, it would be unfortunate to overlook Russia's stunning answer to 2001. Solaris, directed by Soviet filmmaker Andrei Tarkovsky, was released in 1972 and remains a unique, emotionally powerful film.The story revolves around psychologist Kris Kelvin, played by Donatas Banionis, who is sent to a space station orbiting the alien planet of Solaris to determine whether the station should be shut down. When he arrives, he finds not only the resident scientists Snaut (Yuri Yarvet) and Sartorius (Anatoly Solonitsyn), but also someone or something else. This mysterious being appears in the form of Kelvin's dead wife Hari, played by Natalya Bondarchuk. This entity is not really Hari but rather a creation of the living Solaris Ocean. Nevertheless, Kelvin is captivated with Hari and is soon consumed by his grief and misery fuelled by Solaris.Solaris surely won't appeal to anyone wanting a loud, gory action-adventure movie. Tarkovsky's film is slow, thoughtful and 166 minutes long. In spite of its length, seeing it multiple times is rewarding. According to the booklet accompanying the Criterion Collection's Blu-ray edition of Solaris, Tarkovsky felt 2001 was too ""cold and sterile."" From this viewpoint Solaris is the better film, because it deals more directly with human emotions while maintaining the momentous theme of contact with an alien intelligence. In the Criterion booklet, critic Phillip Lopate argues the contact is even more profound than that. The film suggests a presence of God.As for the look of the film, on Blu-ray it does not have the eye-popping sharpness and colour of more recent American films. Still, the backgrounds are solid and the film looks generally clean. I don't really know why some people complain about the special effects; the Solaris Ocean looks very cloudy and murky, and what's wrong with that? This is my favourite film by Tarkovsky, and I almost wish there was more, a sequel allowing the viewer to return to Solaris in the same way 2001 has 2010.",Solaris

It's a B movie for us but was an A movie at the time for the Russian empire. Some pretty good effects for the time, looking quite cheap by today's standards.

54,khanbaliq2,"Solaris weaves a hypnotic fable about love, humanity, and memory out of its science fiction premise.",10,7 May 2010,"Solaris is director Andrei Tarkovsky's most famous film. It's labeled as belonging to the science fiction genre and most of it does take place on a space station, but it's more a philosophical love story. Kris Kelvin (Donatas Banionis) knows that the Hari (Natalya Bondarchuk) he meets on the space station isn't the woman whom he loved, but in time he realizes that he loves her and can't let go of her. He even mentions that she's better than the real Hari was; probably because she was created from his memories. Solaris features very few special effects. It's not like Star Wars or even 2001: A Space Odyssey. If entertainment is all you're looking for then you probably won't enjoy the film. But it's not boring. In fact it's one of Tarkovsky's most accessible films. It's two and a half hours long, but once I got into it I couldn't stop watching it. It's like the film absorbs you.Some gorgeous images of nature are featured, and the space station's interiors look good too. The whole film seemed like a dream to me. There are details that you pick up only if you watch it more than once. The actors are good in their roles. This is a Tarkovsky film after all. The pretty Bondarchuk is a delight to see on screen. It's often said that author Stanislaw Lem didn't like Tarkovsky's film because it became different from the story in the novel. However, if Tarkovsky shot Solaris according to the novel it would not have been a great film. Its brilliance isn't in the story but in Tarkovsky's vision. Solaris is one of the greatest science fiction films. It especially influenced Russian filmmakers. The film gets a high recommendation from me.",Solaris
55,jluis1984,Going beyond the constrains of sci-fi...,9,25 August 2006,"Often labeled as Russia's answer to Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", Tarkovsky's ""Solyaris"" is one of the most celebrated sci-fi movies in history and definitely Tarkovsky's most famous film. However, and while Tarkovsky indeed stated that he disliked Kubrick's Space Opera, ""Solyaris"" (""Solaris"" in English) was not conceived as a science fiction film to react to ""2001"", but as a meditative melodrama with psychological undertones that just happens to occur inside a Space Station. This disdain for the sci-fi elements earned Tarkovsky the enmity of ""Solyaris""'s source novel author, Stanislaw Lem; but also made the film a very personal work and one of the jewels of Russian modern cinema.At its core, ""Solyaris"" is the story of psychiatrist Kris Kelvin (Donatas Banionis), who is sent to the station in planet Solaris to investigate the mystery surrounding the strange data the three surviving scientists in Solaris' station are sending about the planet's Ocean. At the space station, Kelvin receives the visit of his wife, Hari ( Natalya Bondarchuk), something that shocks Kelvin as his wife has been dead for 10 years. Somehow Solaris has created an apparently exact replica of Hari, but how? and more important, why? As written above, ""Solyaris"" is not a typical sci-fi film and in this case, the whole Space setting is just that, a mere setting. ""Solyaris"" is a trip inwards instead of outwards as Kris Kelvin's odyssey begins at Earth, inside of his troubled soul, the day before being sent to space. Unlike the source novel, where the focus was on humanity's failed attempts to communicate with Solaris, the film is focused on Kris Kelvin's relationship with the resurrected Hari, and the consequences of being faced with the chance to mend previous mistakes. Human relations, desires and conscience becomes the movie's themes leaving science-fiction in the background.The film conveys a juxtaposition of natural beauty and cold sterile ""modernity"", probably to add strength to Tarkovsky's disdain to science fiction. His characteristic use of extremely long takes (following his theory of ""sculpting in time"") is ever present, but while it does indeed give his films a stunning beauty, at times ""Solyaris"" becomes tiring (although never boring). Probably this actually was the intended effect, as the film has time lost running as a constant theme through the film. With a very low-budget he builds up a science-fiction film that doesn't want to be a science-fiction film, but that manages to be an intelligent and original entry in the genre.The acting is overall very good, and even when Tarkovsky himself stated that he disliked Donatas Banionis' performance as Kelvin I think that he was quite convincing and that he did a fine job. Natalya Bondarchuk as Hari (or better said, Hari's replica), is a joy to watch, but even when her character is the important catalyst in Kelvin's mind, the focus is always on him. Jüri Järvet and Anatoli Solonitsyn are Dr. Snaut and Dr Sarotious respectively, the two surviving scientists at Solaris. They have small roles, but both give awesome performances that give life to their supportive characters that made them unforgettable.""Solyaris"" is a complex movie with many layers that while a very rewarding and enlightening experience, may be too slow for modern audiences; to make things worse, Tarkovsky's ""sculpting in time"" style goes a bit too far, making the film hard to sit trough for fans expecting a fast packed science-fiction film. Howere, despite all this, the film's ambiguous nature and artistic beauty make it a delightful movie. Probably at times it may be too preachy, but it's a great humanistic science-fiction tale.With a deep meaning and a warm humanist philosophy, the film can be viewed as a meditation on human relations. It may not be Tarkovsky's favorite film (he even considered it a failure), but ""Solyaris"" is an often overlooked milestone in cinema that challenges the constrains of its genre and becomes something else, something more. Something special. 9/10",Solaris
56,petra_ste,The anthropic principle,8,23 February 2016,"This is an interesting (although not entirely faithful) adaptation of Stanislaw Lem's masterpiece, one of the rare science-fiction works willing to explore a first contact scenario with an advanced alien life-form - not creatures who display familiar, understandable goals and emotions, but a genuinely incomprehensible extraterrestrial entity. See also Lem's novel Fiasco, Arthur C. Clarke's Rendezvous with Rama, Denis Villeneuve's recent, excellent Arrival.The living ocean of planet Solaris is able to tap into human consciousness to materialize dreams and desires in the form of mysterious beings who visit a Terrestrial outpost; psychologist Kris Kelvin witnesses the return of his dead wife... or at least a projection of her, someone who is subtly different from a real person and yet keeps growing more and more human.The best thing about Solaris is how the entity's motivations are left ambiguous. Various possibilities are considered: are the apparitions a gift from a benevolent being? Or maybe some kind of test the ocean uses to interact with a life-form so different from its own? The answer is left to viewers, in one of sci-fi's most tantalizing Rorschach tests.Tarkovsky directs with elegant unbroken shots and a deliberate pace. Horrific moments are barely glimpsed at; the main tone is lyrical, melancholic.

Lauded as a sci-fi masterpiece they say.Shot on a shoestring budget, Soviet what more could go wrong? After all it spawned a 2002 remake by Steven Soderbergh.I digress. It is set in the near future as a Soviet space station orbits a distant planet called Solaris.The trouble is the rather erratic behaviour of the cosmonauts on board the station with suicides and unsettling stories such as those of Berton.A psychologist Kris Kelvin (Donates Banionis) is sent to the station to see what is going on. Should the station continue on its mission of discovery of the planet?Kelvin arrives on the station to find it in a state of typical Soviet disrepair and the three (two alive) residents acting strangely.
At this stage the film starts to go Pete Tong as Kelvin begins to see his dead wife Khari. (She died a decade before).The film descends into mind games of Kelvin as he ends up a mental and physical wreck.
A slow film in parts. It drags on for nearly three hours. I would advise deep concentration to watch this Russian language subtitled film.Draws comparisons to 2001: A Space Odyssey in its use of outer space station, classical music supplied here by Bach and psychological mind games.

59,AhmedSpielberg99,Astonishing!,9,1 June 2018,"I can see why many people compare between Tarkovsky's Solaris and Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. Despite both films have completely different themes, It's so clear that Tarkovsky was inspired by 2001 while making Solaris. But the influences have nothing with neither the themes nor the messages and the philosophy of the movie. Tarkovsky influenced by the style and the technical aspect of 2001: A Space Odyssey; the tone. some of the camera shots, the way of using the imagery (in some cases), and even the production design. With that said, I don't think there should be any comparison between the two films.To be honest, I hate 2001, because I think it tells its relies so heavily on its message that there's almost no story to tell. It keeps repeating its messages, that we have already recognized from the get-go, throughout its running time. Adding insult to injury, it tries to be riveting by showing how wonderful the camera work is,how mesmerizing the cinematography is, how fascinating the production design is, how masterful the editing is, etc. While all these technical points made this movie the most beautiful movie I've ever seen, instead of relying on the technical aspect, I think it should have engaged us with the use of narrative elements, such as a dramatic plot, well-wrought and fleshed-out characters, or in a worst-case scenario, a mysterious event or even character. Fortunately, I think Solaris is way better than 2001. It has a fair share of metaphors, and also has fully-developed characters, a coherent plot, and powerful messages. The result is a movie that has a very comprehensive and engaging story that tugs at your heartstrings. Needless to say, the acting is great, the direction is masterful, and the cinematography and the production design are nothing but art! It's just the slow-pacing that sometimes I felt it wasn't necessary. Specially, before the climax as this should exactly be the time when I should be entirely focused, but I found that I get a little bored.Some may find the messages are presented in a direct way and somehow in your face, but that was completely intended. It's the first Tarkovsky film I watch, but it's obvious that presenting the message in the dialogue is kinda his trademark. The characters don't reveal the message to put an end to the story. instead, they keep involving the viewers with the messages they discover along the movie.

Fancy, not to far from my home and my phone. I had heard Tarkovsky was some kind of a fashionable author those days in Paris, especially with cinema students. It was a sellout. About 500 people for what is the most cerebral movie experiment I ever attended.Among the disturbing movies I couldn't criticize point-blank once back in the breeze of real life, Persona had at least a steady unity. Solaris is more a patchwork of nice pictures and philosophical dialogue.I read somewhere that Tarkovsky did this because 2001 had left him craving for more meaning. There is too much and there is enough. 2001 is a great show. Solaris is tiring. Kubrick was a cerebral type but he translated this in pictures that read his mind; then it is up to audiences to seize only the beauty of images or the meaning within. This is art.

The scientists on the Solaris space station make up no end of sub-Roddenberry guff in their plan to defeat the mysterious green glob.Do they succeed? I don't know, I turned it off after two hours.

The opening grasses-in-the-water scene seems to be saying something important:  ""look at the water, bozo"".  So you look, and look, and you look some more and you don't find anything of value except the realization that you are an idiot for watching this film at all.  This is a highly conceptual film, appealing to two groups:  either that minority of people who have actually read the novel and can understand every scene, and that other minority of people who pretend to like this film just because its Russian and just because it's well-loved by the other minority of people who continuously point out its profundity.

This feeling didn't really last to the end, however. Reading several reviews, good and bad, eventually helped me piece together something of a story, which hadn't been at all apparent during the film itself, but which led me to realise that there was possibly some basis for the events depicted. I would need to read the book, or perhaps watch the later version by Soderbergh. I don't think I can be bothered, however.

66,charchuk,"Not really sci-fi, but the ideas and themes run much deeper",10,4 March 2008,"I really likes how it draws the viewer in with its promise of sci-fi spectacle and ideas, but then shifts gears and becomes something else entirely. I'd argue that it's not really science fiction at all, it just uses it as a base for its larger purpose. At its heart, it's really a psychological drama, and though I usually prefer sci-fi, I really dug the ideas and themes it got going through its human relationship. I read that Tarkovsky didn't like 2001 because it was cold and distant, and so set out to make this film differently, but I didn't really view it as the 'anti-2001'. It's an entirely different type of beast entirely.It's a film first and foremost about memory, and in that regard it's a lot more similar to something like La Jetée in the sci-fi realm. From the opening scenes where Kris is gazing sadly into a pond, the film is almost completely concerned with the effects that lost loves and past memories have upon us. When Kris first encounters his deceased wife in the space station, he doesn't know how to deal with it at first, and he sends her away in a rocket. When he encounters her again, he becomes afraid to lose her again, and thus when she risks death to be near him (by busting through a door), he vows not to leave her side again, foregoing his mission to stay with her. It's almost as if he falls in love again, and it's interesting to see it happen.Even more intriguing, though, is the actual character of the wife, Hari. Though she is nothing more than a manifestation of Kris' thoughts at first (she can not even exist without him there, as evidenced by her door-busting antics), the way she evolves into a real human being by the end of the film is probably the most interesting part of this film. It brings up all these ideas of what it means to be human and where our memories come from, and this, in my opinion, is a lot more compelling than Kris' story. When Hari, the manifestation, eventually decides to commit suicide by drinking liquid oxygen (only to return to life, moments later, in a terrifying and disturbing sequence), it conjures up even more questions. Is the manifestation doomed to follow the path of the original, who also died by her hand? Perhaps no shot is as provocative as the final one, though. Just as we've thought that Kris has returned home to reconcile with his father, the camera pulls back to reveal that he is, in fact, on one of the island that has formed on the surface of Solaris' ocean. So many questions abound. Does Kris know he's on Solaris? Why is he there? Is he, really, or is the planet manifesting him as well? It's one of the more baffling and affecting final shots in cinema (right up there with 2001 and Planet of the Apes, as far as sci-fi goes), and it just feels like the perfect ending. The film ends where it began, at Kris' father's home, but it's not the same place at all. The journey of the story is at once linear and circular.I don't feel like I got everything on just one viewing, so I'll definitely be watching it again. It certainly doesn't feel like a masterpiece - certain scenes feel strange and out-of-place - but when viewed as a whole, I don't know what else you can call it. It's one of the greatest films I've seen, let alone in sci-fi, and I truly look forward to visiting it again someday.",Solaris
67,LivingDog,Pretentious yakking,1,21 August 2010,"I just saw this and did not fall for it. Here is my comment I posted at NETFLIX. I think you will see that it is nothing but pretentious yakking.8/21/10 @ 10:08 PMI did not find this movie to be ""painterly"" or ""deep"" as others have described it. First of all, my major dislike of this movie is that _no_ science is done. Science is about answers, philosophy is about questions. So in a real scifi, there would be information gained through interaction. Instead the characters stand around - with an alien in their midst - and discuss 'what is happiness'. Did you see ""Contact"" with Jody Foster? When she arrives she has a thousand questions. The reply makes sense. Now that's how it's done. This? ""If you are happy you never ask about the meaning of life."" WHAT?? WHO CARES! A freakin' alien life form is standing in front of you and all these guys can do is get pensive??? So OK, here's the REALITY about this movie - it's typical Russian over self-indulgent mental gymnastics. Don't waste your time. You will learn nothing from this drawn out psycho-babble philosophy paper. See The Seventh Seal for a much better film.

68,OttoVonB,"""Nobody loves poetry like a Russian!""",9,7 October 2005,"This line from Dr Zhivago says all you have to know about Tarkovsky. He was a thinker and a poet. An artist who's work was at once smart, engaging and aesthetically beautiful! Solaris is a world that materialized thoughts and absorbs creatures into its own consciousness. ""Solaris"" is an allegory on man's place in the universe, the twisted concept of reality, the meaning of love, grief and - ultimately - life. Psychiatrist Kris Kelvin goes to the station orbiting the planet-entity to assess whether the madness of it's occupants means all exploration should be discontinued. What he finds there are all the demons he has brought with him. You the viewer shall experience the same thing, for Solaris is an inviting and questioning but never manipulative film. What you'll get out of it depends on what you bring with you.Solaris is often accused of being slow. This is a common misinterpretation: Solaris makes you anxious, and willingly so. Too many segments are like mirrors that invite your mind to venture off into many uncomfortable a place (the traffic scene comes to mind: an allegory for the space voyage but also for fading life and powerlessness). Solaris also makes you fear, with a sense that something isn't quite right and as with the best horror films, what you dread often isn't even on screen. Solaris makes you heart ache on several occasions as well. It makes you miss loved ones and it makes you feel homesick. every additional minute that separates you from the gorgeous opening shots of nature makes you long for Earth.Solaris is many things but above all it is simply more than entertainment: it is a voyage for the senses, like a favorite song that binds countless disconnected feelings and thoughts. It is a poem.",Solaris
69,GeorgeRoots,"Love In Space Is A Bitch, But Boy Does It Know Something About Longevity.",10,17 March 2015,"(Vague spoilers ahead that will not ruin the whole movie. I will be putting information from other references and interpretations into the review, everyone will be named should you wish to read into these authors interpretations).""Solaris"", stands as one of the great philosophical movies ever made. There is no grand spectacle to behold, no blaster rifles or even sparkling utopia's etc. Just a wild ambition to pit the terms ""Science"" and ""Fiction"" against each other. The production began as Director. Andrei Tarkovsky, wished to bring more emotion and intelligence to the genre, which he found lacking in Western Cinema. Upon seeing Stanley Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (1968), he describes the experience as ""Cold and sterile"", being too enamoured with polish and looking like a museum of futuristic gadgets. An admirer of Polish writer Stainslaw Lem, Tarkovsky began work on an adaptation of Lem's novel ""Solaris"" (1961), a narrative dealing with themes on the nature of human memory, experience and the ultimate inadequacy of communication between human and non-human species.Psychologist Kris Kelvin (Donatas Banionis), spends his last day on earth preoccupied by the lakes and nature around his childhood home with his elderly father. He is about to set off to a space station orbiting a planet named Solaris, a sentient planet whose surface is entirely made up of water and after decades of studying no progress has been made. The crew on board have been sending back erratic messages of emotional crisis, and people arrive to debrief Kelvin who will help determine if the project should continue. After discussing his thoughts with his father, their departure is particularly bittersweet.Kris travels to the Solaris space station to evaluate the situation, to see the halls ravaged and the electrics destroyed. Only a few scientists are there and seem very hostile towards each other. Puzzled at what has befallen them, only to then encounter the same mysterious phenomena as the others. Solaris begins to send ""manifestations"" of Kelvin's dead wife Hari (Natalya Bondarchuk), who committed suicide some years before. Originally shocked as he tries to dispose of her (It), he eventually begins to accept her (Its) presence, leading to debate amongst all those around them as the planet's surface begins acting very peculiar.Adapting roughly 80% of the novel, ""Solaris"" has been adapted three times in Cinema (1968, 1972 and in 2002, starring George Clooney). Stainslaw Lem (Who passed in 2006), had expressed that none of them really got to the heart and message of ""Solaris"" itself, stating that no adaptation decided to question the planet's motivations and man's encounter of the unknown. Stating that his ambitions were to exceed what could be reduced to human concepts and emotion, hence why he never named the novel: ""Love in Outer Space"". It was reported that while Tarkovsky and Lem had a close friendship writing the script, Lem was furious when production company ""Mosfilm"" had it drastically changed. Tarkovsky was adamant to have his space station in ruin, various scenes would allude to Rembrandt whilst rooms of recreation would contain iconic art such as ""The Hunters in the Snow"" (1565), by Pieter Bruegel the Elder (Giving Hari an idea of how humans act).It is by discussing Kelvin's Wife Hari, do we get to the heart of this adaptation. Slovenian Marxist philosopher Slavoj Zizek, points out importantly that she is only a manifestation of Kelvin's memories and not her own, a man's dream or guilt realised. Film enthusiast ""Kogonada"", has also noted that the dialogue is keen at tackling ""Science"" against ""Fiction"" (With Kelvin stating ""You mean more to me than any scientific truth"" to the erratic Hari). It was a role that had much difficulty getting casted, and Natalya Bondarchuk had finally won it even though she was initially turned down. Her performance could easily be one of the greatest in all of Science Fiction, her tears are genuine and her naturalism blends into the story effortlessly (An example of life imitating art, Bondarchuk revealed in 2010 that she fell in love with Tarkovsky during the filming of Solaris and, after their relationship ended became suicidal).The dialogue I feel particularly stands out as extremely well structured and layered, an element Tarkovsky would later state as his biggest regret saying that in having to explain all the technicality it removed a lot of artistic choices that would feature prominently in his later work. Continuing to re-incorporate classical works, ""Ich ruf' zu dir, Herr Jesu Christ (BWV 639)"", by Johann Sebastian Bach was incorporated as the main theme, plus and a haunting electronic score by Eduard Artemyev. Tarkovsky's long takes and Vadim Yusov's cinematography is as gorgeous as ever. Elemental things from earth such as lakes and plants, to waters and flower pots aboard the station constantly occupy Kelvin's mind, and whereas I feel this deliberate slow pacing will be a turn off for some people, I implore you that there is a deep well of thought here worth your time. The last thing to mention is that all this was made with the equivalent of $829,000 (Given the repressive times the company couldn't afford to put more money into it, no movie should possibly be this good).Final Verdict: There's a beautiful quote I love attached to this film, ""We don't need other worlds. We need a mirror"". Whereas I personally wish we continue to explore space to its fullest, It's the little things like that in movies like this that can be dissected and interpreted endlessly. I've brought a lot of outsider quotes and trivia into this review, but ""Solaris"" to me is one of those few films that lead to endless analysis and enjoyable discussion among newcomers and cinephiles alike. It's about love, it's about regrets, ""Andrei Rublev"" could be Tarkovsky's masterpiece, but this is my favourite among his works and a crucial statement on what it means to be human. 10/10.",Solaris
70,bix171,The Best Possible Medium For Tarkovsky?,3,9 January 2003,"Though it's obvious you're in the presence of genius, Andrei Tarkovsky's film of ideas is excruciatingly slow, so slow that you have to wonder why he has chosen film as a medium when print or opera may be a more effective communication method. There's no question that this film (based on a novel by Polish author Stanislaw Lem, unread by this reviewer) about a mysterious planet supplying life forms to occupants of a Soviet space station that replicate individuals from their past is handsomely (if a little cheesily) mounted and Tarkovsky's sharp camera and slow tracking shots are beautiful. But there's so much discourse, particularly in the film's early sections, and so little happens over the course of nearly three hours (just under five full minutes are dedicated to the view from a car windshield) that you begin to wonder why you're watching it and to feel that the whole thing was conceived in a stifling university lecture hall. Though it barely works as a narrative film and seems so rooted in the classics that it's difficult to be considered avant-garde, it does have some compelling themes, particularly the notions that the most identifiable human communication tools are that of guilt and regret and that happiness can only be felt when not dwelling over basic questions of existence. But the rigorous, idiosyncratic vision that Tarkovsky possesses to illustrate his philosophies makes it all seem so ponderous that there's little for the viewer to do but admire.",Solaris
71,Eternality,"Tarkovsky's most well-known film, Solaris is without a doubt a first-rate endeavor by one of Russia's greatest directors.",9,19 December 2010,"Tarkovsky's most well-known film, Solaris is without a doubt a first-rate endeavor by one of Russia's greatest directors. Despite making only seven films in his short-lived career, Tarkovsky remains to be a master of his own craft, developing a unique visual style that employs long takes with a slow but deliberate camera-work that draws the truth out of his complex characters. In Solaris, he attempts a science-fiction film based on Stanislaw Lem's novel of the same name. And like all great films of this genre, Solaris is both provocative and philosophical.Tarkovsky's film tells the story of one man, Kris Kelvin (Donatas Banionis), a space psychologist who is tasked to travel to a space station in Solaris (an isolated celestial body faraway in space with the potential to unlock clues to Man's existence) to investigate the mysterious happenings that have caused a few unexplained deaths to the people working there. In true sci-fi tradition, we learn that Solaris' oceans are sentient and can recreate loved ones who have passed away from the memories of those who stay there. Kris meets two delusional scientists, and discovers a video made by a dead person that forewarns him of the madness to come.Solaris' relative lack of music that accompanies the film allows Tarkovsky to fully rely on his camera to evoke suspense, unease, and emotional tension. For some odd reason, the film feels like Kubrick's The Shining (1980) in the exploration of what a place can do to someone's mind. Hallucinations occur, ghostly figures of sorts that walk about the station. They are neither specters nor are they organic. However, they keep returning even if one banishes them out to space, as Kris finds out for himself. You see, his dead wife Hari (Natalya Bondarchuk) returns and ""haunts"" him, but not for reasons that are evil.The struggle for identity and the desire to feel loved are core themes of Solaris, just as they are for Spielberg's Artificial Intelligence (2001) three decades later. When a sentient human-like creation wants to feel loved, could a real human ever be accommodating enough to offer ""it"" that love? Kris eventually succumbs to the prospect of infinite love with a being that could very well be a figment of his imagination, irking the scientists on board to the extent that they are considering realizing their destructive thoughts. Now who's delusional, they are entitled to ask.The Kris-Hari relationship forms the narrative core of Solaris' second-half. Particularly, Bondarchuk delivers an exacting performance that allows the injection of emotional warmth so absent in these kinds of films. In a way, Tarkovsky's film is the anti-2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), described by the Russian director as ""sterile"", which he saw only years after completing Solaris. Ironically, Solaris could be seen as an extension of Kubrick's sci-fi masterpiece, both thematically and visually; there are far more elements in common in both films than not.There is a very special sequence in the first-quarter of the film prior to Kris' departure to space that shows the point-of-view of a vehicle traveling along a long stretch of road with cars passing by. It is an extended long take that could be read as a metaphor – that of an endless journey into the unknown about to be taken by Kris. Along the way, the vehicle goes into a multitude of tunnels – perhaps a foreshadowing of the darkness to come? Solaris is beautifully photographed by Vadim Yusof (Ivan's Childhood, 1962; Andrei Rublev, 1966), and ends with a satisfying twist that provides the film with its most chilling, skin-crawling moment.GRADE: A (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved.",Solaris

74,noahgibbobaker,Overfocus leaves blind spots...,9,19 June 2021,"Overfocus leaves blind spots, that's where the issues with 'Solaris' arise. Tarkovsky isn't about specifics; he provokes and knows precisely how to do so, he created an artifice around him where his films aren't about any one thing ('Solaris' is closest to being an exception), but to each individual they are. His movies end up being about what the audience members think he thinks. This is especially clear with 'Solaris', a film where trauma is pulled from normal people's pasts to confront, like audiences forced to project to ""understand"" Tarkovsky. The issue I allude to is his desperate need to be thought provoking, often distracting from details and fluid storytelling.In saying that 'Solaris' tells a hugely detailed story of a Tarkovsky everyman dealing with trauma at different points of his life - different stages represented by each character. We all struggle, things like trauma and existentialism can be impossible to overcome; ignorance is bliss, it's best to stick to the lakes you believe you know, rather than the vast erratic ocean you don't.

76,antagonist117,A story that understands the strengths of science fiction,9,5 August 2013,"One of the strengths of science fiction as a genre is that it frees storytellers to deal with fundamental questions that would feel out of place in more ""realistic"" settings. In real life in the early 21st century, only neurotic philosophers and unfashionable authors spend their days and nights thinking about what makes a human a human, whether our species is fragile or nearly immortal, and whether reality is a subjective product of our flawed memories and perceptions. Most people think about these things only occasionally, since our everyday experience does not demand that we address them, but they are recurring problems of our species and it is rewarding to examine them at length in an artistic way. By setting a story in an indeterminate near future when humanity has mastered long-term space missions, and by placing characters in orbit around a planet that can make human thoughts manifest, the storyteller gives the audience a narrative justification for suspending disbelief, and can raise big, basic questions that in the world of the story are of immediate import instead of mere conjecture. The characters in the story, because they inhabit a time and place that are alien to us but normal to them, are able to behave as normal people would in extraordinary circumstances, and we can imagine that we might behave in similar ways. ""Solaris"" is the product of good science fiction storytelling on the part of novelist Stanislaw Lem and director Andrei Tarkovsky. Its meaning is not always as plain as one might wish, but filling in the gaps with one's own speculations has always been part of the fun of this genre.",Solaris
77,TheVictoriousV,In which I hope I know Tarkovsky,9,4 June 2020,"Andrei Tarkovsky takes his sweet time, allowing his exigent metaphysical musings to properly sink in. His 1979 film Stalker made us question if it is truly possible to know oneself (one character mentions a man who entered a sort of wish-granting room to try to revive his dead brother; he was instead given a bunch of money and other material joys). With Solaris, the Soviet legend also questions what it means to know anyone at all - as usual, this is communicated through original, delightfully otherworldly science fiction.Also par for the course is the slow-paced cinematography, which uses cuts sparingly. Remember how Picasso said that art is a lie that tells the truth? I saw someone claim that film editing may be an example of such a lie, even if the rest of what we see in the frame is real (we don't have editing in the real world, ya see). Tarkovsky, I gather, always wanted to use film (by rarely cutting it) to be more honest with how it captures linear time - a feature unique to the art form. That being said, Solaris has a great deal more cuts than, say, Nostalghia and Stalker.When Tarkovsky made this movie, he reportedly wanted to shift the focus of science fiction back to the exploration of human consciousness and perception. Recall that possibly the biggest sci-fi movie of this era, 2001: A Space Oddysey, looked toward the stars and the potential ""next step"" for life itself in a decidedly unearthly, mind-bending way. To paraphrase Ebert: Tarkovsky looks inward.He always seemed to be upset, even as he lived in the pre-smartphone era, that our obsession with technology made us ""less human"" (which tied into his disdain toward 2001 and its fascination with life beyond ourselves). As I understand it, he seems to think that being human necessarily entails being spiritual and by extension, since faith generally says this is the lifestyle that will be rewarded, being altruistic - see the aforementioned man whose inner desires, despite his conviction to the contrary, involved selfish gain. Must we be spiritual to know ourselves and to know that our souls have been tainted by egoism?Of course, I'm persuaded by the Randian view of things; that egoism can be rational and that individualism, rather than the emotional reward and unproven afterlife promised by unconditional altruism, is more likely to result in happiness on your part (that is, tangibly; nevermind any sort of higher existence, ""accessed"" only through lifelong faith or, on the more hedonistic side of not accepting reality, surrendering one's mind to psychedelics). No matter. Best if I leave that can of worms sealed for the time being.I wouldn't say Tarkovsky's disillusionment is on display in Solaris the same way it arguably was in Stalker (not to mention The Sacrifice, which I read as being about how futile, if not destructive, human faith also can be, even as the movie's final note is hopeful). This one, focusing on a sentient ocean that revives the dead but only as the cosmonauts aboard the orbiting space station remembers them (their ""idea"" of them), is truly humbling, helping us understand how little we know of those around us. For some, this shall inspire kindness and disincentivize judgmental thinking.Once again, Tarkovsky seems certain spirituality will help us connect and know each other - one scholar read the film as being about the limits of simple ""rationalism"" (they may have meant ""empiricism"", as I've come to comprehend the terms, since rationalism is also about filling in the blanks of reality in ways that might disregard evidence or lack thereof, disincentivizing the pursuit of actual answers). As you know if you know me, or at least the version of me electronic symbols can convey to your mind, I might not wholeheartedly agree with his solution. All the same, I very much admire his films.The movie doesn't care if you're entertained. It's not something to put on when you wanna ""watch some movies"" with someone, the way that several unsuspecting viewers have doubtless done with the remake. ""Oh look, a George Clooney space movie!

78,Gresh854,Admirable,10,9 September 2018,"Solaris is practically Stalker in space. Well...Solaris technically was released/made before Stalker, so in a sense, Stalker is Solaris on Earth. My conjectures are rather similar to how I feel about Stalker; it's absolutely mind-boggling to see the cinematic achievement Tarkovsky was able to knack despite the sore pacing. They are both, like mentioned before, quite uniform. The movie even has its own ""Zone""-AKA-planet ""Solaris"" which features altered hallucination aspects and what not. Sound familiar? Now, enough with these comparisons, cause in hindsight this movie was a real science-fiction treat. Inserting the prospects of revival upon loved ones who aren't truly their authentic character that are able to linger onto your lust and memory, was a motif that carried the majority of this film to a prosperous victory. It appears that human nature would presumably choose to live in reach of a fictional setting as long as it reminds you of a previous reality-based facet in which, factored within a major fondness hidden inside your legacy. If nothing that I just said makes any sense to you'll, you either might have to give Solaris a chance, or excuse my militant writing techniques.The snug, masterful Tarkovsky script-which features impeccable dialogue that raises questions about humanity's own vital existence-and enduring visual aesthetics make Solaris stand out.

But stay patient and things will get interesting slowly. The story is about a situation when mankind has discovered something beyond their potential and now it is up to them to continue their research or abandon it in the name of humanity.PROS: Though in the starting it was not clear what the film is suggesting, but it had a vague feeling that the plot is promising. How would you react when you have discovered something which is beyond your understanding and you need to decide how to approach further? There was confusion even until the half time but even then this curiosity to know the end, keeps you seated.

After the mysterious demise of one of the three scientists on the base, the main character is sent out to replace him. He finds the station run-down and the two remaining scientists cold and hiding something from him. When he also encounters his wife who has been dead for ten years, he begins to appreciate the baffling nature of the alien intelligence.Based on a novel, Solyaris is a deeply profound art movie by Andrei Tarkovsky in a sci-fi setting. Even though its quite good, it took me three tries to finish this almost three hour long movie. Its extremely slow paced in the first half, not necessarily boring, but some of it is; like the utterly pointless five minute scenes of an old car going through several tunnels, flyovers and looking at skyscrapers which signify a 'futuristic city' but really seems ridiculous even for a 1979 movie. The movie gets a lot better after Kelvin gets aboard the space station and also gets quite confusing. There's minimal special effects and it rides on the strength of its absorbing storyline and actors who all do a good job (Kelvin bothered me a bit. He was too artsy just for the sake of it), the standout being the lead actress, Hari. It showcases a compelling study of human nature, consciousness, existentialism and alien nature. The ending is frankly terrific without the movie ever deviating from its meditative pace.I re-watched parts of it and it makes me appreciate the movie so much more. What I interpreted from Tarkovsky's version is that life began in the ocean of Solaris and from the deep depths there emerged a consciousness. It didn't know where or what it was, where it was coming or what its purpose was. Then the scientists landed on the planet which represents an enigma to the consciousness. The real enigma is the human psyche and existential crisis of us human beings. That this came out of the Soviet Union at a time of communist rule is nothing short of remarkable. Apparently, Tarkovsky himself doesn't hold this movie in high regard. Though it is flawed, this is the kind of sci-fi we should be getting instead of generic good vs evil cgi warfare. Its mysterious, frightening and intensely self-ruminating. 8/10",Solaris

Enormously challenging.,8,5 October 2004,"Extra-terrestrial encounters, mysterious deaths & resurrections, psychological battles of will... and a planet with a brain for its sea-like surface! Who said the sci-fi genre only needed drooling aliens and space gadgets to be this good and absorbing? This is my favorite alternative, and invariably a kindred spirit comrade to Kubrick's ""2001""!Tarkovsky greatly juxtaposes between the story's futuristic setting and theater-stage, dream-like thematics and manages to create a unique, haunting atmosphere. Long and slow-paced, surely, with sometimes strangely unjustified footage, but intellectually challenging and absolutely fascinating. Many will call this pretentious art-garbage - but stick with it, sci-fi fans with a brain - and I think a big screen is demanded to fully absorb it; it has its rightly deserved position up there among any top movie in the genre! 8 out of 10 from Ozjeppe",Solaris
83,Artimidor,"The self, the unknown and a step beyond",9,16 July 2012,"Outstanding movies should point to something that lies beyond, wherever that may be. To a horizon, clearly right in front of you, but which you cannot grasp, not even try to. Or beyond your own self, to something trusted, something so deep inside that it fails all description, eludes you, yet teases to understand it - after all, it has always been there. Few movies manage to point at both, like ""Solaris"". This is a picture that operates on the borderline between the self and the unknown, between what is alien and what makes us what we are, and even more so: ""Solaris'"" theme is in fact about understanding: ourselves, the unknown, the bridge between these extremes... all wrapped in one of the most powerful science fiction stories of the 20th century, written by Stanislaw Lem.Lem's book focuses on the futile communication attempts between entirely different beings, humans on the one hand and an intelligent ocean-like form of existence on the other, a life-form which covers a whole planet while producing fascinating phenomena to the visitors from afar. The ocean communicates by materializing physical human imitations, persons created from the memory of the humans - blessing or curse, attack or welcome gesture, who can know? According to Lem mankind thus has to understand that it is merely a ""speck of dust"" and irrelevant in the general order or chaos of things, however Tarkovsky subverts this view in his own interpretation and intentionally digs deeper into the human psyche. His adaptation adds its very own spiritual twist to the source material and puts man himself back on center stage. Admittedly he opens up more doors than he gives concrete answers in the process, but in doing so he addresses profound philosophical issues in the scope they deserve. After all, it's man's perspective through which we see the universe, and while we undoubtedly fail to see the bigger picture, we learn more about us in every confrontation, especially when they're as profound as in ""Solaris"". Don't look for special effects or action here, be prepared for an extremely slow trance-like experience that sucks you in and will stay with you.Soderbergh by the way remade ""Solaris"" in 2002. It is a Hollywood product, has George Clooney, is more accessible and basically a bland sci-fi romance, devoid of Tarkovsky's depth. Take your pick.",Solaris

He finds out that the planet is in fact a living inteligence that interferes with the mind and reason of the human being creating images of pleasure, but, sometimes, images of fear and dispair.

Just as all the tarkovskij movies, this is slow. Yet intriguing, scary in certain moments, giving a terrified feeling without expressively showing horroristic events.I think most of sci-fi fans will like this, little sceptical about others.The reason of the rating not being 10/10 is mainly the absence of some things from the book, like Kelvin actually landing on Solaris, and the slightly retro design of the escape pods.",Solaris

Based on the case I was expecting something along the line of typical American sci-fi. Needless to say I was wrong.I watched Solyaris twice in two days, because the first time I saw it I knew that I hadn't processed even a quarter of what I knew was there. I was taken completely aback. The second viewing was extremely rewarding.It was unusual for me, raised as I was on the sledgehammer moralizing and we'll make our point so obvious that there's no way you can miss it because we have no respect for your intelligence way of American film. I'm a huge literature buff, and this was one of the very few films I've confronted that is thoughtful and has so many things to say yet does it in a literary or poetic fashion.You will get out of this film what you bring to it. I've been to so many movies where the audience is not actually participating, it's being attacked. But true art is not domineering; it woos you.So to sum up, I greatly appreciated Tarkovsky's unwillingness to manipulate the viewer. It showed that he had respect for me as a thinking soul, and it is this love and respect for humanity which makes this a truly great film.",Solaris
88,pontifikator,"The long, Soviet version of Lem's novel is enigmatic and, well, long.",6,13 March 2010,"The long, Soviet version of Lem's novel is enigmatic and, well, long. It has long scenes.Among the movie's enigmas are why the directer bounced back and forth between color and black and white. In ""Memento"" we can figure it out. Here in Solaris, I have no clue. But that enigma pales in comparison with what the heck is going on. The Soviet version follows the novel more closely than Soderbergh's 2002 version, but the novel itself is a dense, thick book which has as its thesis that we will never be able to understand alien life forms, no matter how hard we try to communicate. I'll suggest that this is a metaphor for alienation in the Soviet Union under communist rule: we can never know what other humans are telling us because we can't tell if they're hiding their true feelings, trying to trap us into making criminal admissions, trying to avoid making criminal statements, or whatever. Further, there's the plain inability to communicate effectively which is shared by all humans, whether under tyrannical rule or not.We see Kelvin with his father, mother, and aunt at their dacha shortly before Kelvin leaves for Solaris. Kelvin burns most of his papers; apparently his trip will take decades in earth time, and neither Kelvin nor his father expects the father to be alive when Kelvin returns. There is a cloudburst, and Kelvin remains out in it, letting it drench him.SPOILERS--------------Kelvin arrives on the space station un-aged, and we see the bewildering circumstances which the shipmates (Snaut and Sartorius) fail or refuse to explain to Kelvin. After Kelvin sleeps, his dead wife is in his room with him. It seems all the other crew members have had what they term ""visitors,"" too. One crewmember, Gibarian, has killed himself. He had a visitor, but no one knows why he committed suicide. Kelvin puts his wife in a rocket and sends her off, but the next time he wakes up, she's with him again - another visitor.The problem with the movie is that Tarkovsky can't show us the problem effectively. Lem's point of view (as I understand it, and I may be wrong) is that we won't even recognize communication from an alien - it will be totally alien to us, unrecognizable as communications. The issue isn't as simple as translating the languages; it's the problem of determining that what's going on is an attempt to talk. The alien in this version of Solaris (and in the novel) is the ""ocean"" on the planet. It can move and change its shape. It appears to be reading people's memories as they sleep, then it sends a visitor to each person based on the memories. The visitors however, are all defective in some way, and Kelvin and his revived wife (Hari in this film) can't figure out whether her defect (she keeps committing suicide but returning to life) is the result of Kelvin's memory (his overriding memory is that she killed herself but he could have prevented it if he'd paid more attention to what was going on) or some defect in how Solaris is creating Hari.Ultimately for Hari, the cause of her defect is irrelevant, and she is desperately unhappy. Sartorius figures out a way to annihilate her so that she doesn't return to life, and she leaves Kelvin with only her note. Kelvin somehow beams his encephalogram to the ocean, and the visitors stop. Apparently Snaut and Sartorius decide to depart for earth. We get a scene of Kelvin back on earth walking around the pond near his dacha, but the water is solid. He goes to the dacha, and his father is inside, where it is pouring rain, drenching him. Kelvin's father sees Kelvin, comes outside, Kelvin falls to his knees, and embraces his father. The camera pulls back further and further, and we see that the land around the dacha is an island formed by the ocean, so this scene is being played out on the planet. (This is why the water is solid and it rains indoors - the creation is always defective.)I have no clue from the movie whether Kelvin stayed, going down to the surface and this is him we see; or whether this is a memory created by Solaris from the encephalogram, and this Kelvin is a visitor, as is the father. If this is the real Kelvin, we get a feeling of Kelvin returning home (albeit in his memory) and receiving his father's forgiveness, but for what I do not know. The reconciliation of father and son has some meaning, even if I can't figure out what the separation was; there's a communication between the two by touch and presumably by emotional feelings. This might be seen as a hopeful ending.If Kelvin went home and this entire scene is a creation by Solaris, then I'm guessing Solaris has intuited that humans communicate by sharing emotions. If Solaris is utterly silent, then this would be a sensible guess on Solaris's part - it has no knowledge of sound and speech, so it would miss that entirely. It may be then, that after everyone left, Solaris has a key to how to begin communication. If this is the case, then the ending is bleak. The experiment in communicating with Solaris was years long and failed.Perhaps ironically, I'm in the same boat with Kelvin, Snaut, and Sartorius: I have no clue what Tarkovsky is trying to tell me. I have too little information to make a guess I'm comfortable with. I could watch the movie again, but it's two hours and forty minutes, and I'm not willing to invest that much time again - ironically perhaps, like the crew leaving when Solaris finally found a key to communicating. C'est la vie.",Solaris
89,calspers,Philosophically dense and beautiful sci-fi grief drama from a master of the art form,9,22 January 2020,"""Solyaris"" (1972) is based on the novel by Stanislaw Lem and written for the screen by Fridrikh Gorenshteyn and co-written for the screen and directed by Andrei Tarkovsky is Tarkovsky's third feature film, and what a difference from the first two visually, as it shot in color.Derived from a great and philosophically rich script, the film touches upon some of the most existential aspects I have ever witnessed within science fiction - afterall, this is Tarkovsky. He simply creates a universe of his own - a vessel for the viewer. Symbolically, however, I didn't find ""Solyaris"" to be as densely packed as some of his other works like for example ""Ivan's Childhood"" (1962) or ""Andrei Rublev"" (1966).The first ten minutes of the film feels like being taken on an exhibition of an art gallery - it is simply staggeringly beautiful.The rest of the film follows this once again, thanks to Tarkovsky putting on hos usual display of power when it comes to visual storytelling ability. He had an impeccable talent and vision for cinematography, lead by director of photography Vadim Yusov. It is truly breathtakingly beautiful - again with brilliant tracking shots, impressive frames, and elaborate use of long takes allowing for the demonstration of the beauty of the images displayed.The film has obvious connections with Kubrick's ""2001..."", but where 2001 according to Tarkovsky was a bit of a cynical tale, he chose to drench ""Solyaris"" with emotional engagement and drama. This works beautifully and I think creates a very touching story within the plot.Fascinating and ground-breaking cinema and strongly recommended.",Solaris

Chances are, you won't get to the secrets hidden in this film... as this masterpiece explores the origins of life, existence, mankind, love and our species itself.It took me quite some time to digest this film after watching it the first time. I recommend also reading SOLARIS by Stanislaw Lem, too... not necessarily before you watch the film. For me, personally, the approach to the content of the story is quite different. Where Lem uses dialogue and constructs of thought to explore the problem (or magic?) of existence, TARKOWSKI does it in visual form, sometimes without words. It's two different paths that accent the same hill. But I don't promise you that you'll reach the top by digesting them. It is a long way.Some sequences of the film are very long, which forces the viewer to comprehend and brood on his own thoughts while being flooded with amazing, otherworldy images. TARKOWSKI is a master in guiding the camera and using sometimes long (very! long!) shots to unveil a certain idea, thought, character trait, situation, ... - his movies are highly constructed and filled to the brim with metaphors, codes, allegories and still - some space to fill for your own thoughts.For me, this is for SURE a science fiction classic, because it approaches philosophical and ethical matters without mind-burning action, fireworks and awful alien species. It is the heart of what I believe true science fiction to be: a quest to understand the origin and whereabouts of mankind, existence and the place of science, technology and man-made inventions to explore the great unknown. Who are we? What are we made of?The film does not answer you these questions.

91,steven-222,Failed Adaptation of a Great Novel,3,13 August 2006,"I first saw this moldering museum-piece of Soviet cinema back in the 70s; even then it seemed clunky, ponderous, and naive. (The ""futuristic"" city has freeways and tall buildingswow!) Rewatching the movie on DVD (an excellent transfer), I see now what I didn't see then: how slavishly it tries to mimic Kubrick's 2001 (the theme of first contact, the deliberate pacing, the overloaded soundtrack, the attempt to evoke a sense of wonderment and to probe high concepts); but Tarkovsky lacked the resources, technical skills, and artistic vision of Kubrick, and the result is very flat.Tarkovsky did not lack for great source materialthe remarkable novel by Polish author Stanislaw Lembut he couldn't summon the special effects know-how to reproduce the phenomena of the planet Solaris, or the writing skill to transfer Lem's mind-blowing ideas to the screen. There's a lot of pretentious dialogue, with characters namedropping Dostoyevsky and Tolstoy; if only the director had been as respectful of Lem!The later Soderbergh version of SOLARIS is essentially a remake of this movie, not a fresh interpretation of the novel (probably Soderbergh didn't even read the book). Soderbergh's movie is more successful then this one, but still falls woefully short of giving us Stanislaw Lem on the screen. The best Lem adaptation is still THE SILENT STAR from 1960. Lem later disowned his early novel (THE ASTRONAUTS) on which that East German film was based, because of its outmoded socialist optimism, but despite its naïveté and dated special effects, THE SILENT STAR nevertheless has moments that capture the genuine sense of awe that Lem could evoke so strikingly in his unique novels.",Solaris
92,jazzest,"Adaptation of Lem's Classic Sci-Fi Novel, but Dated",5,19 July 2004,"(Spoilers Included)In 1961, Polish sci-fi author Stanislaw Lem created a planet called Solaris, which communicates with the Earthlings via physically presented figures who appear in a space station. The figures have appearances and identities of persons who are significant to the target astronauts and scientists, and don't know they are created and sent by the planet. The novel suggests the fragility of human existence in a setting of space exploration; one line from the adapted film says, ""Man doesn't want to conquer space. They just want a mirror.""This Andrei Tarkovsky's adaptation must have had a huge impact back in the 70s, but unfortunately, it looks fatally dated. The primal reason may be the shift of the world structure since the time the film was made; the all Russian space exploration was only realistic as the ""future"" from the 70s Russia's POV. The other reason may be acting, which is too sarcastic and dramatic to portray scientists. European ""avant-garde"" electronic/noise compositions back in the era increase the sense of obsolescence. Several scenes are unnecessarily stretched out, most namely, the scene of the protagonist's meditative contemplation while cruising Tokyo in a cab.Notable artistic merits include occasional long takes that are extremely well-choreographed, and editing that cuts clips immediately after new information appears in the frame--this keeps the viewers busy to reflect the info they just saw, while increasing uneasiness.",Solaris
93,Ziglet_mir,"The Extreme Outside Setting, Looking In",10,23 April 2018,"My first written review of Tarkovsky, and my third film of his I have seen (behind Stalker and Andrei Rublev). So far this is Tarkovsky's most accessible film. Obviously 'more accessible' does not mean worse, because as my movie-watching experience goes it has affected me profoundly--more than Andrei Rublev, and possibly more than Stalker. Solaris is one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen. Like all of Tarkovsky's visual poems, there are stunning moments of nature; a gurgling stream, rustling leaves upon a branch or marsh weeds falling victim to the eloquent movement of water, and while what we are seeing is simple, Tarkovsky captures it like no other. Solaris' opening shots present these marsh weeds moving; flowing, and I can do nothing but watch. Tarkovsky certainly had a talent, and he may very well be at the top of the list for making film pure poetry.The actual plot of Solaris is intriguing and fresh. We are introduced to the crew of a space mission to the planet Solaris by video--our main character Kris Kelvin, a psychologist, is eventually enlisted to investigate why the crew has gone insane. We learn that the atmosphere of the planet has an ability to reach into our memories and provide us with a manifestation of someone who represents that past the most, and Kelvin is caught up in Solaris' powers when he discovers his dead wife on the space station--alive and well. She is not her real self of course, but the amalgamation of particles the planet's atmosphere can manifest into when it reaches into our memories. Slowly, does Kelvin get dragged into the past as he falls in love again, tragically--knowing very well she is not his real wife. What the film gives us is a masterful introspection of love and life and what it means to be human, at a time when the characters are no where near Earth. Solaris is certainly unique because most sci-fi films give you the feeling you're in space and in ways also feel claustrophobic, but this does the opposite. We know we are in space and near a planet that is incredibly far from Earth, but it doesn't ever feel sterile or cold like space should be (2001: A Space Odyssey). The conversations between Kris and his surrogate-wife are heart-wrenching, and pushes further the question, 'what does it mean to be human?'I may be at loss for some of the thematics in this film, but I took away what made sense to me, and it is beautiful.",Solaris

But if you have the patience for such a film, you will be rewarded with a solid sci-fi film. It's main theme has been seen in later films, but I'd venture to say none have covered it better. I haven't seen Soderbergh's 2002 remake yet, so the comparison will have to wait. I'm sure the 99 minute run time will appeal to the more modern audience, but I'm sure it won't have the same feeling.

However, Tarkovsky in the film admits through a character to being more of a Dostoevskian storyteller, of the unconscious and base, the noble and the delusionary--how the heart is always fighting for supremacy over the intellect and even the soul, which it must follow.      ""Solaris"" is indeed about love and attachment and the eternal need to be close to another human being, and about letting it all go, in dreams and in death.  The ending is as brilliant as ""2001""s but instead of another leap in evolution, the individual soul labors on toward redemption, understanding, and liberation.

98,CinefanR,How can we understand the universe if we don't know ourselves?,9,20 January 2012,"The Russian ""Solaris"" presents an ultra slow, meditative take on space exploration and human nature. Although not as gripping, atmospheric and visually impressive as ""Stalker"", ""Solaris"" deals with alienation in a typical Tarkovsky fashion. Other themes include the ethics of science, virtual reality, identity, inter-species communication, and the inherent human limitations and paradoxes.Stanislaw Lem once said that our ability to adapt, and therefore to accept everything was one of our greatest dangers. But is our destiny something that we accept or do we fight against it? How far do we go and to what result? Is there such thing as ""destiny"" in the first place? What choices do we have and what do we choose when given a second chance? The film raises more questions than it answers, and that's a hallmark of good science fiction.More personal and self-admittedly lacking the scope and grandeur of the other ""proverbially good sci-fi movie"", '2001- A Space Odyssey', 'Solaris' is actually opposing Kubrik's film - in tone, message and style. What they share is only a philosophical dimension that finally redeemed the sci-fi genre, showing it for what it is: an evaluation of the human condition. Devoid of special effects (except a few representations of the alien ocean), Solaris focuses on psychology.One major impediment for the viewer is probably the length of the movie. It is clear that the loneliness, isolation and despair surrounding the characters requires such an approach, but I didn't find 'Solaris' to be overall as engaging and intriguing as other lengthy movies of the same director. My first impression was that the space station looked like an old TV studio and Donatas Banionis didn't seem particularly good for this role (Natalya Bondarchuk however, gives an impressive performance). Despite these issues, Solaris was still a rewarding experience. If there was ever an argument against space exploration, this must be the most convincing one. The human psyche is a dark and still uncharted universe, more enigmatic and dangerous than the infinite outer space.",Solaris

The flawless acting and plot should only be revealed when one is immersed in the cinematic experience. It is certainly a deep story with many undertones, but one in particular that stuck with me is the reality of perception.Solaris is impactful on many levels, but on at least one, it questions what is meant to be real and what is not. People disregard ""insane"" stories as simple hallucinations or lies until further proof is given. At a certain point, though, what constitutes real proof is impossible to even fathom and thus define. When in an unknown territory and everything appears foreign, making connections to what you know is true is the rational thing to do. To piece together things at its fundamental level and try to work from there. This works in most ordinary cases. But this movie isn't ordinary.After watching Solaris, I am as excited as I am disturbed. Excited because, in my own eyes, I feel immortal; yet disturbed also because I feel immortal. Not in the classical sense that I can live forever, but from the perspective that I do not know how long I live nor where exactly it is that I live and to where I go.

Since these happened on a different planet, they then send a psychologist there to evaluate the situation.The rest of the movie is about the circumstances that slowly 'forces' the psychologist to ask difficult questions regarding life.In the East, you hear such questions being asked and discussed since you are a child, so its natural and easy to ask it when life goes awry. In the West, only when someone is older and experiences huge pain that they tend to ask such questions and by then you are so prejudiced that its a struggle, so this is like a big deal. I guess that's why this movie is highly regarded. But to emphasize this point they have made this movie too serious and this I think degrades our receptibility. There are so many fantastic movies on the IMDb top 250 which bring about this point, and they all do it in a way that touches your heart (because the way inside is through our heart), but here it was dry and cold.But do check out this movie, you may appreciate/enjoy it, but even if you don't it won't be a waste of time.",Solaris

At times it seems like Tarkovsky is remaking 2001: A Space Odyssey into a love story, but while the atmosphere of space as boring tedium is captured (too well), the story is not nearly as engrossing. Several scenes just hang, and hang, and hang, and then goes a little longer just to get the point across. Ponderous close-ups of ears, rustling grass, candles--a never ending drive through Soviet rush hour traffic--it seems the director was shooting for a visual masterpiece, and decided to write the story in around it.

104,tripperM,a once banned russian film comes out in full...,10,21 March 2001,"the very first sci-fi film i ever saw was kubrick's awsome 2001. i was 4, my parents went to vegas for new years w/ my 10 year old sister and i and didn't quite know what to do with us in the late hours while they gambled and rang in the new year. at ceaser's palace or sahara (i can't remember which, for a while i thought we lived in both...)there was a cinema, well... a viewing room accually. it held about 50 people and the screen was a standard 50 mm screen. my parents gave my sister the key and told us to go back upstairs after the film. we had no idea what we were getting into or what had started right then and there as a life long love. my sister fell asleep before the first rotation of the space station, and i was mesmerised!i had not heard about solaris until my teens when there was an announcement that the local art-house theatre (the same one that showed classic films and midnight theatre) was to show the first american showing of the complete version of the ""russian 2001"". with b/w cut ins from once lost reels, this 2 1/2 hour film would send me back in time. once again i was engrossed. the cinematography was exemplary for it's time and orgin, the story line was deep and intellectual, and the development of character and insight into the psychie of humanism was wonderful. clark told our side of the development of the cold war and it's underlying effects on our american egos, lem showed us the effects it was having on our russian brothers. he showed us not only the instability of russian futurism, but the declining individualism that eventually brought down the wall.i hear that soderbergh and cameron plan to remake solaris. well, kudos to them if they can do this and still keep the very important russian ""flavour"" (i don't know what else to call it)that makes this beautiful film what it is - the best damn russian sci-fi EVER.",Solaris
105,moviefansme,Russian 2001 and Interstellar,7,29 August 2021,"I recommend Solaris (1972) for fans of 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) and Interstellar (2014). The movies are as different as their directors, but they're all fine directors and their movies explore many of the same themes in similar settings. I also see the influences on Melancholia (2011), another great film with some similar themes. It even echos ""Shore Leave"" (S1E15) of Star Trek (1966).While Solaris is a great film, I also have to say: It's long, it's boring, every scene drags on forever. It has very little action, mostly just dialog, very little occurs, mostly it's described by the characters, and all the more difficult to follow because the dialogue is Russian with English subtitles. It strained my attention span, and I really had to pay attention to follow what was going on. The film has a lot to say, but be prepared to pay close attention.",Solaris
106,lumieretrain,Solaris (1972) by Andrei Tarkovsky,9,27 October 2021,"Exploring a science fiction story, where the main characters express their psychological emotions in their journey are some of the most complex as well as some of the most interesting stories, to explore in the novels, graphic novels, poets, movies, television series and video games; especially to see at which direction their actions will take, when they choose some paths in their roads. Some stories would end with their death, to see how they finish with they had to deal with, while other stories would end with them still alive and moving forward with they are looking for. The auteur filmmaker Andrei Tarkovsky seems interested so explore this complex topic, as later on he went to the production to work his third feature movie, which is an adaption of the novel Solaris by Stanislaw Lem, which has fascinated him a lot. After a long time of work, in 1972 came out Solaris by Andrei Tarkovsky with Donatas Banionis, Natalya Bondarchuk, Jüri Järvet and Vladislav Dvorzhetsky. The movie's plot: The psychologist Kris Kelvin (Donatas Banionis) travels to the space station which orbits the planet Solaris, to see which is the reason there have been only few crew members left alive in the space station; once Kris Kelvin arrives in the space station to meet the the last crew members, he will try to understand which has been the reason of them to have emotional crisis, until he will soon have similar emotional issues like the crew members. The movie seems to have captured attention of the audience and the critics, especially to see at which direction Andrei Tarkovsky will go with his third feature movie; as usually when a filmmaker makes a new feature movie, it can be risky to see if the filmmaker has accomplished either a surprisingly worthy movie, or to be instead a movie which did not work at all with the themes and the topics, that the story wanted to explore about. The third feature movie by Andrei Tarkovsky has instead surprised a lot the audience and the critics, for being a unique story which explores complex themes in the psychological way, to see how the main character and the supporting ones will take actions to confront with what they are facing to; by making the movie more unique, it uses poetic scenes which make the emotions of the story visually captivating, with profound reflections of the way the characters are trying to see their emotions and ask themselves important questions to answer their conflicts. The production designer Mikhail Romadin elaborated the settings which make clear, the direction of the story and the way the characters express their emotions through specific details of the space station as well as the specific objects which surround them and the Solaris planet's ocean. The costume designer Nelli Fomina has created costumes which fit with the shape and the colors of the characters, to see how their emotions will change from the beginning to the end and far their dramatic choices will take. The cinematographer Vadim Yusov has captured some of the most essential shots, in every single camera movements as well as in every single angle shots, to create poetic frames on the screen; especially when those scenes are helped by the lightnings and by the the shadows which create much captivating images to be unforgettably poetic. The editor Lyudmila Feiginova has elaborated the narration's rhythm, to be clear how the story will be told from the beginning to the end, without rushing it to ruin the story, but to instead give enough time to let audience feel the poetic images of the movie and the emotions of the characters to be expressed. The score by Eduard Artemev has been particularly elaborated to create emotions of the story by focusing on the expressions of the characters, which uses different times the choral prelude of ""Ich ruf' zu dir, Herr Jesu Christ, BWV 639"" by Johann Sebastian Bach. Donatas Banionis did an extraordinary performance as Kris Kelvin, the psychologist who has been sent to the Space Station to see which is the reason that only few crew members have been left alive and which is the reason of their emotional crisis; until he will soon have the same emotional crisis, to get memories which affects him psychologically. Natalya Bondarchuk did an excellent performance as Hari Kelvin, the wife of Kris Kelvin who died years ago and she will appear after his arrival of the space station, in a specific way; as the more time she will spend with him, the more the situation will become complicated. Jüri Järvet did an excellent performance as Doctor Snaut, one of the last survivors of the space station who explains Kris Kelvin what happened, at the same time he expresses his emotions mixed with paranoia as well as disillusion and the way he tries to have the feeling to be in Earth again. Anatoliy Solonitsyn did an excellent performance as Doctor Sartorius, another last survivor of the space station who is much harder than Doctor Snaut, as he also expresses his emotions of paranoia and disillusion to have lost sensibility. Vladislav Dvorzhetsky did an extraordinary performance as Anri Burton, a retired pilot who has been in once in the Space Station and as he tried to explain how much the emotional crisis has effected him during the mission, unfortunately no one believed him to have been accused to have had hallucinations. Nikolai Grinko did a well done performance as Nik Kelvin, the father of Kris Kelvin who lives in a normal life where he sees things in a simple way; before Kris Kelvin goes to the space station, Nik tries to convince his son to not cause problems to his friend Anri Burton, as Kris does not initially believe in what Burton saw. Olga Barnet did an excellent performance as Kris' Mother, who will be seen in the flashbacks in some of the most essential moments of the story, to see how the emotions of Kris Kelvin have been affected during his time in the space station. Solaris is one of the greatest masterpieces ever made, one of the best masterpieces by Andrei Tarkovsky and one of the best movies of 1972.",Solaris

110,antoinebachmann,Very contemplative,8,13 March 2003,"Altogether a very nice film to watch with a number of powerful, contemplative scenes. Very nice and brutal contrasts mark the pace. Given the contemplative nature, and the length of the film, I believe it is better to have red Lem's book, Solaris, before watching the film Tarkowsky made from it. Just as, with 2001 A Space Odyssey, it is better to have read Clarke's book to get a better enjoyment of the last part, which is also very contemplative - only with Tarkowsky's Solaris, the contemplative ""part"" is about 90 percent of the film. The few action scenes are quite powerful, stunning even.Interestingly the underlying philosophy in Lem's book is that space and the different things / lifeforms to be found in space are always interesting and always potentially good, if vastly different, because they force Man to find real mental balance, real Harmony, or else he may not be able to withstand what the Universe has to offer. But Tarkowsy basically dismisses all this and his underlying conclusion seems to be that space is bad and we are better off in a cabin somewhere in the Russian countryside.Anyway, overall and though certainly not suited to today's mostly uneducated, and impatient, sci-fi audiences, Tarkowsky's Solaris is probably a masterpiece.Antoine",Solaris
111,mark-rojinsky,The Soviet Union's answer to Kubrick's 2001,7,13 September 2021,"Adapted by Andrey Tarkovsky in 1972 from Lemberg-born Polish-Jewish writer Stanislaw Lem's 1961 novel, 'Solaris' is often seen as the Soviet Union's answer to Kubrick's '2001' (1968), but is far removed from the 'fun' aspects of Hollywood-style movies. Indeed, if you can stand its slow often turgid pace it is a quite heady intellectual experience as it explores such profound universal aspects as 'beauty', 'spirituality' and 'self' and is more of an inner adventure of the mind than an outer one. Stocky Lithuanian actor, Donatas Banionis plays psychologist Kris Kelvin who is sent to the planet Solaris.- a glutinous miasmic sphere which is beyond empirical analysis. It conjures figures from Kelvin's past including his young wife who had committed suicide. Whether these figures are simulations or 'karmic effects' is another matter. In his book 'Sculpting in Time' (198?), Tarkovsky said that he was interested in Buddhist principles. Some of the imagery is quite amazing and the use of compelling Bach organ fugues is evocative. The tall bespectacled longhaired figure, Dr Sartorius (Anatoliy Solonytsyn) looks the part as a Russian intellectual. NME's Chris Bohn quoted one of his colleagues who remarked that '(Tarkovsky) has a way with colour unequalled by any other director western or otherwise', while another '80s NME writer, Andy Gill said that with Tarkovsky '...art pours out of every orifice...' The early-'70s were pioneering years and 1972 featured many intelligent and serious films including Couffer's 'The Darwin Adventure', Rosenberg's 'Pocket Money', Bolt's 'Lady Caroline Lamb' and Charlton Heston's 'Antony & Cleopatra'.",Solaris

Having said that even this music sounds like it's played on the weirdest sounding organ you've ever heard. I think this film strives too hard to portray every nuance of the character's psychology.I wonder how many takes were shot before he achieved the acceptable expression of uncomprehending angst on his lead's face.Then there's the old characters on the station.Had they started as young men?I know how they feel because when i started watching this I,too, was young.",Solaris

There's no suspense - you know the characters aren't becoming insane, because that would make the film pointless. When Kelvin, the lead, sees a woman walking in the station which supposedly only had 3 men in it, you immediately see the resemblance to his dead ex-wife. Like other people have said, seconds turn into minutes, and the ending, just as the beginning were drawn out affairs. I don't think it's beautiful. If the scene appeared for a few seconds, I'd probably admire it, but it stays on screen so damn long that you just want it to go away. I watched this film becausemany people rank it above the new American release, and I thought originals would be better. But I now hope the 2002 version have a different ending, because if it's faithful to the original, I'd be damned for ruining my own viewing pleasure by watching a really bad Russian film.",Solaris

Why did we have to spend ten minutes watching the protagonist drive down a highway?",7,21 June 2014,"The idea behind this original film adaptation of Stanislaw Lem's classic science-fiction novel ""Solaris"" is sound: the idea that humanity finds at the furthest end of its exploration of space... a mirror, so that people are forced to see themselves and stop avoiding the things they'd rather forget.Once the viewer (my wife and I watched it together as we both speak Russian) gets past the tedium which the screenwriters inject into the plot to make it LESS interesting (what I meant by an ""anti-adaptation"" of the original novel), then yes, that point is made, and made very powerfully.Nothing's wrong with Solaris that cutting thirty to fifty minutes of very boring footage couldn't fix. In that respect, it far outshines George Clooney's Hollywood remake of Solaris, which actually put me to sleep - something the Mosfilm original didn't do. A fine example of what ought to have been cut from the movie is the drive back from the dacha into town over what was probably intended to be a futuristic highway. I thought that concrete, elevated highways were super cool the first time I saw them, too, but as an adult I can say that the whole scene adds NOTHING to the movie - it's just tedium for tedium's own sake.Just ignore scenes like that and hang around for the good stuff, when the psychologist actually lands on Solaris.

However underneath it as an introspective film about relationships and humanity. In that respect there is also an obvious correlation between this film and Kubrick's 2001. Amalgamate the 2 films and I believe a synergistic masterpiece would be in the making. On their own however I regard both as butt-breakers that would try the patience of a replicant.Pros - Excellent premise that is reworked from Lem's novel.

Here is one of those exceptional cases where the film adaptation of the book is better than the book itself. Unfortunately, this, in my memory, only happened with science-fiction. This is not in the best way characterizes the artistic merits of Sci-Fi, but on the other hand, allows you to appreciate the value of the method of fantastic assumptions, which makes it possible to focus on some real problem, comprehend it through the work of art. Tarkovsky in his interpretation of Solaris shows the problem of morality, the ability to ""remain human in inhuman conditions"".

117,cmcastl,Sci-fi romance at its very best,10,21 December 2016,"If I could rate Solaris (not the 2002 American one!) on my own scale I would give it 1000 out of ten!It is the doomed sci-fi romance which gets to me and frankly makes my lip quiver. Solaris, the sentient ocean, sends Kris a simulacrum of his dead wife Hari but the longer she and her subsequent copies companion him the closer she gets to being his former wife resurrected. There is this poignant scene where they have this conversation about how he has got on after his wife's suicide, almost as if they were having the normal conversation of couples but, in this case, in the most strangest and tragic of contexts. What is now almost perfectly his dead wife is asking her husband how he has got on after she killed herself. But this is no ghost. What started out as an alien experiment to contact mankind is turning into one man's formerly dead but now living wife with whom he has begun to fall in love all over again. The most moving, magical and surreal romanticism is at work.It took Andrei Tarkovskiy to achieve this. Americans, or in the case of Stanley Kubrick, Canadians, can produce sci-films of epic production qualities but they are often schmaltsy or with Kubrick clinical. Natascha McElphone was severely beautiful in the American version but could not begin to project the soulfulness of the glorious Slavic (actually Ukrainian) beauty Natalya Bondarchuk. Donatis Banionis (Lithuanian) wears a marvellous dead-pan existential angst throughout the film. This film, although based on the novel of Polish sci-fi writer Stanislaw Lem, sports almost how Leo Tolstoy would have written a sci-fi screenplay. This is an absolutely classic sci-fi film with a beating human/alien heart. As far as I am concerned the American 2002 Solaris is stuck on the launchpad while the Russian version soared into the infinite.",Solaris
118,auberus,If a Soul has been given to us then maybe our existence only make sense in retrieving it.,8,10 August 2007,"Some films are intellectually challenging. Some films need to be thought about afterward. Some films deserve to be re-watched. Solyaris might be among those films as it is in the same time challenging, intriguing and scary. Countless reviews have been written on Solyaris; needless to say lots of them present a feasible explanation for the film. I am proposing my explanation of Solyaris. Not in the details but in the principle. I don't pretend to understand Mr. Tarkovsky better than others I just think this movie deserves to be understood and I hope my view of this film if not exact will help others understand it and why not appreciate it. Often and wrongly presented as Mr. Tarkovsky answer to 2001 A Space Odyssey, Solyaris was undeniably an answer from at the time the USRR to the western World and his cinema emissary Mr. Stanley Kubrick. Even if Mr. Tarkovsky was in awe at the technical achievement that ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" represented in 1968 he was nonetheless in disagreement with Mr. Kubrick's view of Mankind quest for Truth integrating too much Technology and not enough Humanity. As a result Solyaris might very well be the most humanist science fiction story ever put on film. Stanislaw Lem's novel provided Mr. Tarkovsky with an opportunity to propose his view on this universal and infinite quest for Truth. Mr. Tarkovsky's goal was also to transcend the genre of science fiction as per him a director can not limit himself to a genre. This is one of the many reasons why Solyaris is a difficult film as the audience's references to the sci fi genre are drastically shaken. Right from the beginning we understand that the story is not going to be an easy one to grasp: the cosmonaut Kris Kelvin receives the mission to reach the space station orbiting the intriguing Solyaris, an ocean like planet. His prerogative is to investigate strange events occurring on the orbital station from where the remaining scientists are observing this ocean. One of them Dr. Gibarian has committed suicide and the other two remaining (Dr. Snouth and Sartorius) are haunting by visions coming straight from their respective past. Soon Kelvin understands that the planet is an intelligent being and is materializing these memories. But when he is confronting with the recreation of his deceased wife Hari, his belief and certitude start to be shaken and never will be recoveredthe problem is, ours too As Professor Messenger said in the first chapter the protagonists of the films ""are probing the very frontier of human knowledge"" but is it proper to artificially establish a knowledge frontier? ""By thinking it we are limiting our concept of infinity of Man's knowledge"" and therefore we forbid ourselves to comprehend events beyond that frontier. In that perspective the risk is not technological failure but the failure of our mind. The consequence is a profoundly childish but nonetheless human reaction: an attempt to destroy that which we aren't capable of understanding in short, the planet Solyaris. The appearance of the guest Hari created by the Solyaris Ocean reflects on the overall dynamic. Since Kris Kelvin does not understand the reason and the possibility of Hari's presence on the station, he wants to get rid of her by sending her away in a rocket. But when a recreated Hari reappears during the following evening provoking Kelvin's introspection, she by her very presence forces Kelvin to face Truth about himself. However in the same time she allows Redemption. Often left aside, the notion of True Love as a medium for Redemption of the Soul is a theme very much anchored in Solyaris. ""Guest"" Hari is clearly not Kris Kelvin wife rather a subconscious projection of his own needs of her. Dr. Sartorius's experiment has proved that appearing ""Guests"" on the station are made of neutrinos elements stabilized by Solyaris force field. However as Hary developed memories, she appears as the most human being among the crew. The cybernetic expert, Dr. Snouth is trapped in his incomprehension of Solyaris, the astrobiologist Sartorius is obsessed by his quest for Knowledge not understanding that pursuing knowledge for the sake of knowledge is indeed vain. The physiologist Gibarian can't reconcile grief and false resurrection. As per Kelvin he seems to be in denial eventually considering Hary as an opportunity to heal his soul. Stripped of Memories and understanding the impact on the crew and their so called ""Human Soul"" also because of her genuine Love for Kelvin, Hari chooses to commit suicide as if fatality was inherent to human Destiny. By this very act of sacrifice and ultimate Love, she gives birth to her soul. At the end of the movie and through one of the most enigmatic ""zoom in"" in history of cinema we understand that an island has formed on the surface of Solyaris. We see Kelvin reconciling with his Past as if the Planet will allow him a second chance, a chance to be Human With the film Solyaris Tarkovsky seems to whisper in our ears that Humanity is not bound to a place but to an act. The planet Solyaris creates from dreams and memories and is strangely echoing Men's creations process (eg. Kelvin father's Will of rebuilding his childhood house as per his memory). The film embarks us in the Search for Ultimate Truth but if this Truth is beyond our comprehension it might be because we are searching in the wrong place. Maybe Truth is hidden inside our very self. If so then finding it is confronting our very Soul. So in essence if a Soul has been given to us then maybe our existence only make sense in retrieving it. In ""Voyage in Time"" (an autobiographical documentary) Andrei Tarkovsky said he viewed Solyaris as unsuccessful. Allow me to disagree.",Solaris
119,arkif1,What do we need the unknown for?,10,2 June 2007,"Lem wrote a book about this question, Tarkowski made a film. And unlike stated by Lem about Tarkowski, Tarkowski did not demonise the unknown, but brought forth Lem's own opinion in Lem's own words, that the unknown is of very little use for a creature as preconditioned as the human being is.I almost heard Immanuel Kant behind it. But what surprise? The main character of this film is an ocean on a planet called Solaris, about which we have reason to believe that it owns some sort of intelligence, which then makes itself apparent to us by apparitions. Yes... what exactly said Kant about God? An idea we cling to, because that is our duty, to examine the world as if it were created by an intelligent and benevolent being. Where the world is the medium through which our existence becomes filled and thus becoming able to develop itself. Any similarities with this film and Lem's novel are of course completely... coincidental? I don't think so, no. But the originality of the concept is of no importance anyway. Who understood Kant? And who understands this film? The naivety and clarity of view that Tarkowski proves here are what make this film an unparalleled masterpiece, a one of a kind. I cannot say how much I enjoyed it.Besides, there's more than a conceptual link to Kant, there are two Baltic Actors involved (playing Kelvin and Snaut) and Tarkowski has the same love for nature that Kant had, so, things just match.",Solaris
120,YellowManReanimated,A Beautiful Meditation on Memory and Loss,10,17 August 2021,"Tarkovsky's cinematic vision was, in some ways, deeper and more ambitious than any one else's. His work attempts to bridge the philosophical with the poetic in order to reach the transcendent and he achieves this in a number of his films. Never more directly or more poignantly, however, than with this film. It tells the story of Kris Kelvin, a psychologist who is sent to space in order to investigate the veracity and properties of a newly discovered planet. It is claimed that, through the presence of a unique energy field, the planet can give physical form to subconscious thoughts. The planet's capacity is seen as miraculous by some who treat it with a religious reverance; Kelvin is tasked with approaching his studies as a scientist, however, and it will be his job to dispassionately discern the facts surrounding this strange planet and to ultimately recommend whether it is worthy of further investigation or whether it should be ignored in favour of more practical avenues of study. Nonetheless, it is not long before this planet becomes known to him in a deeply intimate way as it resurrects his wife from his memory and forces him to face the tragedy of his past.The film juxtaposes rational calculation with emotional yearning, it shows how beyond our dispassionate exterior lies a vulnerable humanity which is apt to be consumed by the world we attempt in vain to hold at a distance. As with all of Tarkovsky's films, it is beautiful to look at, Vadim Yusov provides the cinematography including mesmeric shots of the broiling foreign planet and there is a particularly beautiful scene of weightlessness scored with haunting music from Bach. This is a study in love, regret and the futilty of the attempt for objectivity. Just as on our own planet, each person's experience of Solyaris is profoundly personal and, above all else, the film suggests that it is our connection to the personal which provides life's meaning.",Solaris

The acting was good, but I just don't care how Solaris ended or what it was about.A lot of people compare it to 2001:A Space Odyssey, but there is absolutely no resemblance between the two films. I found 2001 riveting when it first came out, when I was 12, and I still find it so today. Solaris is just plain boring, and certainly not ""spell-binding"" or ""amazing"" or any of the other superlative adjectives I've seen used to describe it. It's just cheap and slow and mundane.

123,EnoVarma,Solaris: a Russian space odyssey,9,14 February 2018,"It is the view of many, that Solaris needs to be seen at least twice. The same is, by the way, true with every Tarkovski film. I've seen Solaris several times, also on film, and it has always puzzled me to a degree. The first time I hardly understood the story and I didn't get the ending at all, which seems stupid to me, now. And yet, Solaris is very much a straight-forward, chronological film.It just ""connects the dots"" in a highly evolved way. For example, there is a sequence about 30 minutes in, that has nothing to do with the plot and doesn't really deepen any of the characters. This sequence lasts a full five minutes, has no dialogue whatsoever and is a series of shots from a car driving forward on a highway in urban Tokyo. Couple of times we're shown a secondary character with his son. Audio track is ultra-modern, atonal and expressive. This seemingly inconsequential scene is my favourite in the whole film. Through pure cinema Tarkovski is able to tell the viewer a lot about the nature of the Earth depicted here. We understand better our desire to expand our limits into the spave. Plus, the sequence is utterly hypnotic, enhanced by a sudden cut to an incredibly gorgeous black-and-white shot of a pond with trees hovering over it.And that is the startegy of Tarkovski. He avoids anything familiar and tries to tell and show us something we DON'T know.After repeated viewings, I still feel that with Solaris Tarkovski was only almost completely successful in his pursuits. I have no main criticism to offer, just minor ones.See, there must be a reason why I still feel that the first 45 minutes SPECIFICALLY of Solaris are among the most beautifully realised in Tarkovski's career. This first part largely takes place in a beautiful countryside cottage. Tarkovski is a great depictor of nature (perhaps the greatest), and there is a slight sense of underwhelm during the rest of the film which takes place in a space station, in interiors. In comparison, Stalker, which takes place mostly in exteriors, is also philosophically a richer piece.Interestingly, Solaris, set on a space station, shows practically none of the surrounding space. Again, Tarkovski works against conventions. This and other practices make Solaris an anti-thesis to Kubrick's 2001. Another example: there are few special effects, most of them of the planet Solaris. On the other hand, they are exceptionally beautiful.About the actors: I love them, but this is not a view shared by all. Understandably. Banionis especially is so understated that it's up to you to decide whether he is lacking something. On the other hand, he makes a great pair to Natalya Bondarchuk's more expressive performance.Solaris is a film by a master film maker with only a handful of equals in history. The result is still unique in the realm of science-fiction.",Solaris
124,teodorodontosaurus,Exploding emotions,10,25 April 2018,"Andrey Tarkovskiy must be using the slowest filming techniques in the history of filmmaking... and that's something good actually; this way there is so much room for emotions that is being left. The movie clearly promotes profound human emotions.
""Solaris"" is actually more fast-paced than ""Stalker"", and both are outside of the boredom spectrum; most of the scenes are overwhelmingly eerie and beautiful, even if there's no dialogue.
The philosophy here is outstanding! It gives a whole new purpose of the human existence on Earth. Everything is based on dialogues and symbolic imagery (typical Tarkovskiy concepts) and everything about this movie is a continuum revelation. Even after the end, the movie continues to echo into your mind.
Artistic and soulful movie.
An interesting observation: someone from the movie says something like this: ""Don't transform this marvelous scientific phenomena into a cheap love story."" Well, that's exactly what the American version is!",Solaris
125,alafolle,Intriguing and beautifully filmed,8,8 September 2000,"""Solaris"" is not for those with short attention spans. It is quite long and very slowly paced. But the cinematography is so captivating--drawing sharp contrasts between natural beauty and technological ugliness with its dazzling visual imagery--that its length is justified.Surprisingly free-thinking for a Soviet film (and based on the brilliant novel by Polish author Stanislaw Lem) ""Solaris"" raises deep questions about science and the nature of human consciousness, and lets the viewer draw his own conclusions. Tarkovsky's special effects are possibly the finest ever produced on a shoestring budget, and all the more impressive for being made before the advent of computer graphics. While the acting is occasionally weak, the lovely Natalya Bondarchuk delivers a haunting performance as the mysterious Khari.This is definitely not for everyone, but it is one of the finest and most intelligent science fiction movies ever made, and a very beautiful and moving film.",Solaris
126,christophermoverton,An amazing science fiction gem,9,21 June 2019,"While conventionally the opening plot seems as much a product of influential science fiction pieces like 2001, the movie takes a different course. I think here of the Ancient Greek word mnemosyne in connection to the film's literal psychic manifestations. Technically this word bore a literalism to memory and more often in such times were references to apparitions. This forms the basis of the plot. This thought provoking science fiction is highly recommended!",Solaris
127,Turin_Horse,Symmetriads,10,23 January 2014,"Are we ready to accept that our vision of cosmos and life may be just an illusion of our minds and that other forms of consciousness may take forms absolutely alien and incomprehensible to us?. Stanislaw Lem posed this question several times throughout his many works, reaching with Solaris the pinnacle of his career. Tarkovski adapts Lem's novel focusing the attention mainly in intimate aspects of the personages more than in the technical SciFi stuff. The story line follows the relationship of the protagonist, Kelvin, with his former wife, Harey (who is dead after having committed suicide some time ago)... or more precisely the being that planet Solaris physically recreates extracting from Kelvin's brain the physical and personality features of Harey. The film does not pay much attention to the scientific and philosophic aspects that permeates the whole Lem's novel. This might seem a setback for the film, nevertheless it contains enough values itself to be considered a masterpiece of science fiction, and of cinema in general. Lem's and Tarkovski's visions complement each other extraordinarily, even though Lem did not like and disapproved of Tarkovski's adaptation of his work.But the film absolutely succeeds in creating a dense, haunting atmosphere that traps us from the beginning to the very end. The decaying aspect and environment of the space station orbiting the planet, along with the psychological wearing out of the scientists working there, perfectly represents the despair and powerlessness of humans to understand, let alone communicate with, the vast mass of apparently conscious matter that is the planet ocean, which seems to be able to read even the deepest corners of our very minds, revealing aspects we were unaware of, yet doing it in a sort of unconscious, or naive way... Is it (the planet) just playing? sometimes it seems as if it were learning to imitate others, the way human children do... Excellent performances by Donatas Banionys (Kelvin), and specially Nathalie Bondarchouk (Harey), in a very dramatic role, yet with subtle, delightful points of humor. The film and the novel complement each other, and, unlike so many other cases, both are equally worth to be read and watched.The final scene (and here the film truly overcomes the novel) is among the best ends in cinema history. The ocean recreates a whole scene, not just a personage, in which the protagonist is wholly absorbed, but again, it does it with some carelessness, on earth rain occurs outside houses, not inside them... is it just another stage in the planet apprenticeship process?, or maybe Solaris is also trying to communicate with humans in its own way? we might never know.",Solaris
128,gracie28,Lofty but it really drags...,4,1 December 2002,"Some memorable photography, an etherial quality to some forest scenes, and a strangely furnished space station.  The film has its moments, but not only was it obviously low budget with no special effects to speak of, it really dragged. There is one scene that must last 5 minutes where they are basically driving through city traffic with no dialogue at all.  We watched the whole thing, but had to work at it.  A great example of cinema produced under the communist regime.",Solaris
129,rickytrapp,Solaris: A Film To Be Seen,10,18 April 2011,"Psychiatrist Kris Kelvin is called to a space station orbiting Solaris, a strangle planet-like object. Once aboard, strange occurrences begin and Kelvin is joined by his long dead wife Hari. Through disbelief and love, Kris begins to connect with the replicant of Hari.Solaris is a film to be seen. It's a beautifully crafted, sci-fi masterpiece that owes much of it's brilliance to it's director. Andrei Tarkovsky is a wonderful filmmaker and he has made none better than Solaris. Excellent camera-work, with shots that admittedly go on a bit too long and slow pacing, because Tarkovsky takes time to tell his story. I also love how color plays a major part in this film. The colors are wonderfully light, yet textured. Solaris is a marvelous film to look at.At the center of this film, though, is an understated turn from Donatas Banionis as Kelvin, a unhappy, middle-aged who initially struggles with, but soon accepts through disbelief, redemption and ultimately love, his new version of reality and his regained relationship with Hari. It's a very strong turn from Banionis.Other than that of Natalya Bondarchuk, the other performances in this film are superfluous. The film is full of big ideas and is open to interpretation, but works best as an often tense, sci-fi love story. Highly recommended.",Solaris
130,biker45,A letdown after a long wait,3,20 April 2002,"After reading about ""SOLYARIS"" for years, I finally got an opportunity to view it in it's full length recently. I have to say that it did not live up to expectations and the reputation I had read about. I did not glean any deep philosophical meaning from the film, and the highly-touted surprise ending was easy to anticipate.Comparisons to ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" do not seem justified. 2001 carries a pro-science, pro-technology viewpoint throughout, and SOLYARIS struck me as just the opposite. There seemed to be a strong anti-science (perhaps even an anti-progress) sentiment running through the film.Since I do not speak Russian, and therefore was forced to read the subtitles, perhaps I missed some key plot elements. The subtitles were obviously not a complete translation of the dialogue. I believe that enough of the plot filtered through so that I was able to grasp the major story line.It is a very long film, and there are vast stretches that seem pointless to me. Many elements are introduced and then never explained or alluded to again as the story progresses. Overall, I was very disappointed in the film after having high hopes for it.",Solaris
131,MrsRainbow,had to watch it twice,9,19 January 1999,"I'm just starting out into the vast world of foreign film and having seen this film on many a video store shelf, and knowing that it was considered a sci-fi classic, I thought it would be a good way to spend an evening. Based on the case I was expecting something along the line of typical American sci-fi. Needless to say I was wrong.I watched Solyaris twice in two days, because the first time I saw it I knew that I hadn't processed even a quarter of what I knew was there. I was taken completely aback. The second viewing was extremely rewarding.It was unusual for me, raised as I was on the sledgehammer moralizing and we'll make our point so obvious that there's no way you can miss it because we have no respect for your intelligence way of American film. I'm a huge literature buff, and this was one of the very few films I've confronted that is thoughtful and has so many things to say yet does it in a literary or poetic fashion.You will get out of this film what you bring to it. I've been to so many movies where the audience is not actually participating, it's being attacked. But true art is not domineering; it woos you.So to sum up, I greatly appreciated Tarkovsky's unwillingness to manipulate the viewer. It showed that he had respect for me as a thinking soul, and it is this love and respect for humanity which makes this a truly great film.",Solaris
132,Cyniphile,Beautiful Meditative Observation,9,28 November 2012,"At different points it is beautiful, insane, chilling, but ubiquitously deeply pensive. Yet throughout this lumbering psychological odyssey we are surprised to find the ideas constantly relevant, though they are not overly familiarized in this esoteric setting. It is the opposite; we are skillfully enveloped into this world-view. This movie is very long for good reason. Forgetting reality outside the film for a few hours we understand the strange dilemmas which are presented and exit with a mind evoked both visually and philosophically.Cinematic technique is outstanding. Simple and subtle cuts and motions combined with tinting and lighting constantly direct our emotions accurately and powerfully. Special effects are rather poor (as might be expected from a Soviet film) but sets are well designed. Acting is stellar especially from lead female, though also a bit difficult to judge while viewing in Russian with subtitles.",Solaris

Still a good film, though. I would probably see it again.",Solaris
135,mario-rad,just another crowning achievement from cinema´s greatest director,10,28 March 2003,"There is no argue about the fact that Stanislaw Lem´s ""Solaris"" is probably the most important and original science fiction book of all times. And there is no argue about the fact that best director in the world for filming this is Andrei Tarkovsky. But then again, maybe you can argue about that, ´cause some other director would probably stick more to the book. But not Tarkovsky. What he did here is maybe even better than the original, and represents one of the greatest moments in history of moving pictures. Tarkovsky´s ""Solaris"" is more poetic, philosophical, meta-physical and pure than Lem´s ""Solaris"". Every time I watch it, there is something new to find out, some new message to take, some new brilliance to see. This is as important as any literature master piece of 20th century.",Solaris
136,BSHBen,An Engrossing Masterpiece,10,2 December 2006,"Andrei Tarkovsky's Solaris (or Solyaris) begins with the introduction of the film's principal character, Kris, at his house in rural Russia. From that moment, Solaris continuously intrigues the viewer with its captivating premise (adapted from a novel) and its distinct visuals. The plot concerns a mission undertaken by Kris to reach a remote space station orbiting the planet Solaris. Soon after arriving, Kris's dead wife appears, apparently having been created by the planet from his memories.The scientific storyline serves only as a backdrop for complex reflections about human emotion. The main question posed by the film seems to be about whether the beings created by the planet are real people, or at least whether they should be treated as real people. At first, Kris treats his wife, Hari, with apprehension and distrust, but eventually he grows to love her.In Solaris, Tarkovsky includes many long scenes that, to a typical modern-day viewer, will seem to be overlong at best and simply boring at worst. However, this is not a weakness; Tarkovsky just refuses to spoon-feed everything that the audience needs to know right to them. Many brilliant moments, such as a beautiful scene where Kris and Hari are floating in zero gravity for (a very long) 30 seconds and the perfect, creepy, and fascinating ending are not given an explanation. Rather, Tarkovsky allows the viewer to come to his/her own conclusions about characters, story lines, and motivations.Solaris isn't a film for every one. It's perfectly understandable for someone to find Solaris' long shots and running time to be revolting and tedious. Still, anybody interested in a surreal, captivating, and unique Sci-Fi film should be sure to see Solaris.Steven Soderbourgh made an excellent remake in 2002. The remake's great visuals, cast, and soundtrack made up for its short running time. However, I recommend Tarkovsky's original Solaris for its atmosphere and intelligence.",Solaris
137,bazarov24,Russians in Space A Science-Fiction Parable on the Nature of Mankind,10,6 September 2006,"A nation's image of outer space reflects itself. Jules Verne's moon train was a small wagon-lit. American science-fiction movies stress the gleaming pipes and dials, a kind of hi-fi waterworks. Andrei Tarkovsky's ""Solaris,"" gives us Russian outer space. I say Russian rather than Soviet because this complex and sometimes very beautiful film is about humanity but hardly at all about politics. In any case, the space station on the planet Solaris has an absent-minded neglect about it that could have come straight out of Dostoyevsky's study. There is a suspicion of rust on the pipes, and the furniture would look at home in the Omsk railroad station. One has the feeling that wrappers of half-eaten sausage are lying just out of sight and that a samovar is at work. Outer space is shabbiness, lots of tea and urgent philosophical discussions that leave no time for shaving. Nothing that's visible matters very muchexcept for nature: shots of a pond of water weeds of a running horseand life's surface are quite unimportant. Because of it, the blockish camera work, the egg-like colors and the general visual poverty are almost irrelevant. What matters is the conversations, the problems they raise, the faces that reflect them, seen blurrily as if at the end of an all-night session. Mr. Tarkovsky, who is known here for a truncated version of ""Andrei Rublev,"" made ""Solaris"" from the novel by the Polish writer Stanislaw Lem. It is science-fiction in the formal sense of the word; in substance, it is a parable about the nature of mankind. Set in some future time, it is about the voyage of Chris Kelvin to the space station on the planet Solaris. The Academy of Sciences has found no profit in the long studies made of the planet. Chris's mission is to talk with the three scientists at the station and to report on closing it down. The surface of Solaris is something like a sea, a great pulsating mass. A previous scientist, Burton, has come back in severe nervous shock; he believes that it may not be a sea but a superior order of consciousness, a great brain, in fact. Chris, a haunted but practical man, a missioner of human progress, is prepared to order a final experiment: a massive infusion of radiation into the ""sea."" Burton, now older, is horrified. ""You must not destroy what you don't understand,"" he says. Chris's father, a solitary, severe man, is also appalled. ""Space is too fragile for your kind,"" he says. The whole long, strange trip develops the theme. Mankind, with its aggressive expansionism  intellectual as well as materialdestroys more than it finds. Chris is the practical man who, by the film's end, will be converted. He finds that the space station, that summit of technology, is a heart of darkness. All three scientists there have been shattered by encountering the mystery of the planet. Solaris is, in fact, a great consciousness. Thought is made reality there, including the deepest thoughts of its visitors. One has killed himself, leaving behind an obscure message on videotape for Chris. As he explores the decrepit space stationalmost visibly rusted by the presence of a greater realityChris finds the other two. Sartorius, who will not accept what he can't understand, barricades himself in his laboratory surrounded by dwarfshis thoughts made substance. Snouth, more innocent and hopeful, drinks a lot, but his visitors are children. Chris has arrived with the suicide of his wife, Hari, on his conscience. Hari begins, nevertheless, to visit him. She is not an apparition; she is a yearning that the Solarian sea has given substance and builtthe other scientists explainof neutrinos. But she becomes more and more human until, in an act of abnegation, she asks to be destroyed so Chris can return to earth.Put in summary, the plot may seem ludicrous. ""Solaris"" has its problems. Its rhythm is slow, and sometimes is extinguished altogether. The narrative can be difficult to grasp. Finally, as the film draws into conclusion, the parable seems to unclothe; the sense of wonder that Mr. Tarkovsky has created yields to a certain didacticism. All of these drawbacks must be cited provisionally. ""Solaris,"" whose mystical, totally nonmaterialistic character has won it no other favor in the Soviet Union than the permission to exist, is on DVD in a severely truncated form. The original was reportedly four hours long; a second version, shown in Cannes and elsewhere at the time of its release, was 2 hours and 47 minutes. The version we are seeing is down to 2 hours and 12 minutes and the distributors, who received it that way, say they don't know whether Mr. Tarkovsky supervised the cuts before his death. Obviously it is impossible to judge the pace, the rhythms and the clarity of a film that is cut nearly in half. It is like a fresco partly eaten away by rising damp. The result must be viewed actively and with some effort. But if it is, the result is extraordinary enough to compensate. The film's great metaphorsthe faces of Donatis Banionis as Chris, Natalya Bondarchuk as Hari and Yuri Jarvet as Snouthinvolve us totally in the difficult mysteries. Like his Solarian sea, Mr. Tarkovsky has made ideas walk, breathe and move us.",Solaris
138,ryancarroll88,An exquisitely crafted space and mind exploration,9,23 February 2013,"2001: A Space Odyssey may have invented the slow, meditative sci-fi art-piece, but Solaris followed it in its tracks with its own suit and mind. Because of similarities in their style and method, the two films have been pinned together as rival sister movies ever since their releases and have been compared and compressed time over time by film geeks and scholars alike. That Tarkovsky and Kubrick were both such meticulous (and successful) visionaries in their art direction and scene construction connects the two films more than anything. The main difference is that where 2001: A Space Odyssey is an external peer into the unknown unattainable answers of existence, as spacious and cerebral as it is, Solaris is an internal drama at its core and the connection it builds us with its characters drives the mystery it presents.The film begins with Kris, a researcher/psychologist spending his last day on Earth before embarking on an interstellar mission to the distant and foreign planet Solaris, wandering through the wilderness deep in thought. His troubled mind is reminded of the news that all scientists and personnel who have attempted to examine the planet Solaris have succumbed to psychotic episodes and hallucinations. A friend and former exploratory pilot visits Kris to convince him that his hallucinations were real, and were product or creation of the planet. All this does is further compel Kris to his mission: to assess the current scientists aboard the Solaris space station and determine whether it is reasonable or even possible to continue research. After burning his possessions and keepsakes and having an intimate conversation with his father, Kris closes his life on Earth and departs for space.Upon arrival at the space station, Kris enters to find that one of the scientists, his liaison and friend, has committed suicide and the remaining two scientists are shadowed by apparitions of people from their former lives (coyly referred to as ""guests""). The message left to Kris from his deceased friend is that the planet can read minds and would copy and deliver people out of personal memories to those who were near to it. Soon enough Kris is met with his own guest, a replicate of his dead wife, Hari, who appears and acts like Hari but has no knowledge or memory of what she is; with no other anchors, she is attaches herself to Kris.Up to this point and through to the end, what little the film is able to cast in its philosophical glare it exceeds with in environment and internal struggle. The contrast between the settings of Earth and the spaceship are frightening in their scope. Shots of Earth show a flowing, natural beauty of familiar comfort: reeds flowing through a river, rain dripping through the trees and wind rustling through the fields, a cozy lived-in home, animals. The ship is like a cold, aesthetic Soviet version of a Jetsons prison with sparse, anarchic hallways and either empty or cluttered rooms. In one scene a remaining crewman shows Kris that he can cut a piece of paper into strips and put it over an air vent so that it can mimic the sound of rustling leaves. A loose, dripping pipe is the closest substitute to rain. Kurosawa, after a private screening with Tarkovsky, turned to him and said ""It's very good. It's a frightening movie."" I can see where he is coming from with the movie's presentation of space life in and of itself.Aboard this bleak, exotic space station, Kris must come to terms with his guest, the closest substitute to his wife he can perceive, a product of his mind that cannot leave him and cannot die. If he allows her existence become a reality, what becomes of the memory of his dead wife and how, with this reality, can he differentiate a copied fabrication of someone from who they are truly representing? These are burdensome questions that story cannot answer but the characters continually meditate on. The film's final scene gives an even greater prescience to these questions and meditations.Tarkovsky's restraint in probing the film's preternatural centerpiece gives the movie a lofty, cerebral air, but holding back its mystery was also likely a necessity to pass the Soviet censors. After the back and forth censoring disputes of Tarkovsky's previous film, Andrei Rublev, causing the film to be suppressed nationally and internationally for years, Soviets footed that Tarkovsky ""remove the concept of God"" from Solaris entirely. Considering the stakes of a gargantuan production budget it's a wonder that Tarkovsky was even able to pen the script at all without the censor flaring their noses. With careful writing, Tarkovsky avoids the question of creation and being of these strange, familiar human apparitions and instead uses their existence to probe the mind and condition of them and their hosts. In the film we see Kris evolve a relationship with this strange being who for all disbelieving is his wife Hari, and in turn we see Hari, who has no connection to who Kris's wife is, only that she must be her, face the limits of her own identity.Near the beginning of the movie we see the former exploratory pilot ruminating in the back of his private car on a freeway after showing Kris the hearing of his Solaris experience. There is no dialogue, only abstract, minimal sound effects of streets noises and footage of highway to accompany his stark, searching eyes. The scene is approximately 7 minutes long. If you find yourself considering and pondering the positions of these characters and the consequences of their situations, the movie's space is rich and spiritual; however if you find nothing to ruminate on, it's likely that you will find Solaris a lengthy, tedious streak of long shots and sparse dialogue with very little payoff. Luckily the film gives us plenty of nourishment to ruminate on.",Solaris
139,maryolalov,A real science fiction,9,10 March 2017,"Today we see many movies which are defined as science fiction. But what does science fiction actually mean? Does adding space ships and special effects to a regular action movie make this movie science fiction? My answer is no. The real science fiction isn't just a story that takes place in the future, it's something more. The real science fiction has a dramatic character and almost no action in it.Solaris is one of the movies we can define as science fiction. The movie's special effects are bad because of the time the movie was made. But even though the bad effects, Tarkovsky managed to make this movie awesome. Some people say that the movie is boring because it's slow. But it's slow because you need time to feel the atmosphere of the movie. And this atmosphere is the most important part because if you can't feel the movie's atmosphere then you can't see the pain shown in this movie. The pain of a man who receives the chance to see his wife again after her death but is forced to lose her once more. Solaris is a sad movie and its dramatic character is the thing that makes it so awesome and unique.",Solaris
140,kostasxrysogelos,"Here's to you, Mr. Tarkovsky...",10,11 March 2007,"This is simply one of the greatest movies ever made.Many people shall disagree with that statement: For them, ""Solaris"" is a slow, boring and meaningless movie. If you, dear reader, find yourself among this group of people, please read my arguments against this theory.First of all, the cinematography is simply sublime. I hope no-one argues with that point. The visual beauty of this film was surely ground-breaking for its time -in on some aspects, it still is. Secondly, the actors are amazing. All of them.Thirdly -and here lies the crucial question: does the movie has anything to say?- the movie has indeed a lot to say. But what is it? And how does it show it? OK, I think we need to get some things straight: In an art movie, there are two things one should notice: What does it say, and, much more than this,how does it say it? Art doesn't intend to actually say something. Her role is to show. If there is a message, it exists in 1,000,000 different forms -one for each spectator. Therefore, in my opinion, the famous 'car scene' (and every black-and-white scene in the movie), in my viewing aspect, shows the following: every time one feels lonely or has too much on his mind, the screen becomes colorless. Is there a message? In my opinion: Let loose of your subconscious, your dreams, your consciousness. These are the things no-one can steal from you.Is this the best movie ever made? Probably... but there's also ""Stalker""...",Solaris
141,Spider-52,"A film to be savoured slowly, but one that is ultimately rewarding.",9,12 August 1999,"I really didn't know what to expect when I popped ""Solaris"" into my VCR. I thought perhaps the movie would be an eerie psychological thriller, as that was what the back of the box had promised.  This film is somewhat different from that description; this is one of the most haunting films in recent memory, but not in the way you would expect.For me, the best part of ""Solaris"" was the visual texture of the film. Sure, the special effects aren't flashy (it was made in 1972, after all) but the space station on which the majority of the film takes place is so meticulously crafted that I would say that I prefer the effects over the computer generated ones of films today.  I relished the tiny details, even down to the scraps of litter that were scattered around the floor of the halls.Don't get me wrong, ""Solaris"" really isn't about its effects.  The story behind the film is a very enticing one, and--if you allow yourself to fall under it's spell--a very engrossing one. Try to find yourself 3 hours where you will have no distractions and no breaks from the film (except to change tapes, of course).I have heard comments about the film being too slow and overlong.  I do think some of the early scenes in the film could have been cut slightly. For example, the (over)long tracking shot from the perspective of a car on the highway really doesn't serve much of a purpose, and could have been cut down without losing any effect.I think in the case of ""Solaris"", the movie benefits from moving slowly. I believe Tarkovsky did this purposely so that the viewer could savour all of the details without being rushed off to the next scene.  Overall, ""Solaris"" is not a movie for everyone.  However, if you are willing to watch it with an open mind, I think you will find that ""Solaris"" is a very rewarding experience.",Solaris
142,Ricc0,A man needs a mirror and not new worlds to discover.,10,29 September 2016,"The film talks about a scientist ""Kris"" who joins an expedition to discover ""Solaris""; an oceanic planet with artificial intelligence that is able to create. Upon arriving to the circular station where the expedition is set, our hero Kris meets a materialized memory of his dead wife. (The expedition to discover his inner self starts).The film as most of you know is Tarkovsky's reply to Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", a film that Tarkovsky found cold and sterile and focusing on ""the outside"" (the wrong side) instead of the inside.Tarkovsky's masterpiece starts with memorable scenes from the main character's parents' lake house. The beautiful images and dreamlike pace pull the viewer immediately to a mood that is closer to a meditation stance. Kris then is seen watching a tape of an earlier expedition set to discover the ocean (cerebral system) of ""Solaris"".. the scientist that survived the mission is being mocked by the investigators for shooting a scene of the ocean's surface and the rest of the scenes he shot were of clouds (since the film is more of a discovery to the inner self it is likely that the director is trying to show through these images how mysterious it is to explore one's true being and how shallow our knowledge is).. also the sight is covered by fog (resembling the distractions of life from the meaningful truth that the person should aim for). Yes the ocean of planet Solaris is a metaphor of the ultimate truth that we exist through.. and Kris was going on that ""expedition"". After that we see a long and slow shot of a car going through a tunnel surrounded by many buildings, cars...etc. (Some interpreted this scenery as a way to show how long and confusing Kris's next journey is going to be.. While maybe the director is just trying to show us how distracting life is from exploring ourselves). The allegories in the film are not only consistent with the main subject but they are also well made and beautifully executed.Kris arrives at the station.. a scientist is dead and the other two are confused. The ocean immediately starts ""materializing his memory of his dead wife"". She (the guest - resembling his wife) is ""as real as his wife was"".. the sentence used in the film is in fact meant to question our humanistic relations and whether we really get in touch with others or only with the conscience of us knowing them (has he really known his wife? did he really love her? or did he love what his mind sorted about her?). The guest knows little or nothing about the dead wife she depicts (her limited knowledge is only a reflection to Kris's own limitations).. ""And you? Who the hell are you?"", one of the scientists (Snaut) asks Kris when the latter is confronting him with questions about ""the guests"" (you ask about others but do you ask about yourself?). Yet, at least he (Kris) still has the ability to get involved emotionally with his memory (implying that there is hope - Kris has the ability ""to feel"").The ocean, that I believe resembles the simple truth, means also it is a mirror (simple truth reflects in everything as does everything reflects it).. and now Kris needs to go into the mysteries of death and love to preserve the truth. He talks with Snaut about Tolstoy and how he suffered while trying to love everyone and everything and not one thing specifically. Now Kris thinks the scientist before him died because of shame.. the shame of not being able to love truly.. to know.. to see clearly.. ""A man simply needs a mirror and not new worlds to discover"" (here Tarkovsky clearly states everything about the film). In another scene (considered by some ""the peak of the film""), gravity reaches a stage of zero, Kris and the guest (that resembles his wife) are floating in the air and for that moment they are in touch with the ""simple meanings and feelings"".. and floating with them is a candle! ""In his endless search for the truth, man is condemned to knowledge"" (Kris only needs to surrender and not resist - there he could find his inner being).The growing plant seen nearly at the end of the film aboard Solaris is considered one of the most interesting shots in the film (carrying a lot of interpretations to Kris's special journey).. the earth then and Solaris with what it resembles are interrelated. Kris now is seen again beside the lake house where it all began. Kris though will never return to what he has been his entire life, he will see things for what they really are (this is implied in the scene where he looks inside the house and it is raining from the inside!).. he kneels to his father (as he did with the guest of his wife).. the camera zooms out and the lake house is seen in the middle of ""the ocean"".Tarkovsky may be considered one of the few directors if not the only one (among the famous directors at least) to create with no regard to the different tastes and box office success. He did it for the art itself, for the truth in it.. he did it to meditate on the human nature and existence. He did what was truly unique and great, and people with such a great taste admire him for it.",Solaris

Or did that take place already one hour into the movie?After that, I didn't dare to continue for a week. When I finally managed to convince myself that this movie was CLASSIC and a must for every movie lover out there, I picked up where I left off and man, this one was a fight! A fight to stay awake. But I did it! Unfortunately, as all my efforts were spent trying to stay awake during the whole ordeal, I understood almost nothing of the movie itself, its meaning or finale.Tarkovsky should have gotten the Nobel prize for inventing the ultimate cure for sleeplessness. And I'm off to find some information on what actually happened in ""Solaris"".",Solaris
144,olethrosdc,"Very good, minor technical problems",8,9 September 2004,"So, I have finally managed to watch the original Solaris. This was after I had seen the 2002 US version and read Lem's novel. I found this to be better than the US version, for a number of reasons. I'll break down this review into sections, where occasionally I make comparisons with the novel and the US version.Plot: (This section contains spoilers) The plot is almost identical to that of the novel, with a couple of exceptions. Firstly, Tarkovsky cleverly decides to place the background of the movie in a form of a message from Burton and a visit to Kris father's house. Secondly, the ending is altered - it is similar to the one in the US version, but in my opinion is much better presented and leaves the possibility of Kris being a visitor or himself open-ended. The movie also leaves out some of the distrust between Kris and the other two crew members and his distrust of his visitor. However, there is no easy way this could have been conveyed properly.Dialogue: Most of the dialogue is lifted directly from the novel. This makes it not quite so natural and the actors seem to have a hard time with the lines. The dialogue here touches mostly philosophical points of man's purpose, the purpose of science, the question of man's identity. A major theme in the movie and novel is the reason why man seeks contact with alien forms. What does he expect to find? How does he expect to communicate? The subject is touched upon during some of the dialogues, but it is mostly something that Tarkovsky, with his slow pacing, expects the audience to think about, rather than explicitly having a character proclaim these thoughts.As far as I can remember the US version does not mention these subjects - it opts instead to explore the nature of personal relationships.(minor spoiler) Some of the conversion of the background to dialogue did not work so well. Burton's testimony, which in the novel is something that you anticipate because of prior build up arouses curiosity to the extreme. However, in the movie you soon get tired - while in the novel I was feeling angst for the committee's refusal to listen to Burton, the movie did not manage to convey me this feeling. The characters do act well, however too many things are said too fast - there is an apparent haste, which does not let the ramifications of everything that is being said to set in.Cinematography and pacing: Tarkovsky's likes to let the camera linger, which is not a bad thing. However I found that in occasion the things that he focuses do not convey much to the viewer. An example is the 'river weeds' frame. While it is nice to have images like that, it struck me that this particular one was not very interesting. Most of the other images though, in the flashbacks of Kris, are very well delivered.The change in the relationship between Kris and visitor is depicted relatively well - the route that the visitor follows when near its breakdown is not very clearly depicted, however.Technical: There are some bad cuts, which detract from the slow, deliberate pacing. The Ocean imagery seemed to have three states: Water, Lava and Bacterial Growth. The transitions between the three were a bit abrupt. Maybe Tarkovsky should have used only one, or alternatively used overlaying with clouds to soften the transitions. Not bad, but distracting.Music: The music was excellent. A particularly nice touch was the electronic water drops sound that played a little tune after the rain.Overall: Very good movie, if you have time for it. If you invite friends to watch, make sure they will not ruin the pacing by excessive comments and that they also have the time and patience for it.",Solaris

147,jakkiih,It makes you think,10,19 June 2006,"Andrei Tarkovsky's greatest masterpiece cannot be commented without comparing it to Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. They're very alike in some ways. If you can't concentrate on 2001, you probably can't make it here, and likewise. Tarkovsky's movies have long sequences with not really anything going on in them, and often when there's something going on, you may not have a clue what it is.I believe fans of Tarkovsky will definitely love this one. Compared to, let's say Stalker, this may be easier to watch and a better one to start with, if you're interested in Tarkovsky's films. All the films he's directed has all these weird scenes with no actual meaning, but you're not able to get them out of your head. But what ever you do, never try to watch a Tarkovsky, if you're tired or cannot be fully concentrated on it.Solyaris may be the greatest science fiction film ever made. It's remade by Steven Sodenberg, but you can never achieve the same Tarkovsky did. The movie is based on Stanislaw Lem's Solaris. But the movie can be watched also as a series of beautiful images and fascinating cinematography, but it has pretty much more going on, that everybody may not understand the same way.I think the film has some same themes as Ridley Scott's Blade Runner, which is a great science fiction movie too, in more traditional way than Solyaris. The movie makes you think and it doesn't leave you alone in some while after you've seen it",Solaris
148,davidgoesboating,Almost Perfect,10,29 October 2006,"I had the tremendous privilege of seeing Solaris on the big screen as part of the Russian Film Festival a few weeks ago. I had seen it on video, but seeing it on the big screen only emphasised how good the film was.A common complaint about this film is that it is too slow. This is somewhat understandable - the notorious 'freeway scene' near the beginning of the film lasts a good 5 minutes, at least, and Tarkovsky has always been one for long shots.Solaris is far from boring, however. One is filled with amazement at the immense beauty displayed through so many sequences in the film, and so many images stick with you long after - the lake at the beginning of the film, for example. Or the temporary absence of gravity on the spaceship. The painting with the hunters and the village. The blinding light as Kelvin starts to experience his fever. Or, even, simply, the beautiful Natalya Bondarchuk.I'm somewhat interested that this film is referred to as the 'Russian answer to 2001'. While both are filled with amazing shots, this film bears little resemblance to Kubrick's masterpiece, and yet is its equal, at the very least.It is when watching the film's final shot, one that ranks among the best in cinematic history, that it finally dawns on you completely. You have just seen a masterpiece.",Solaris
149,oldmovieman,Groundbreaking Thoughtful Sci-fi,8,16 September 2005,"Watching this movie in 2005, after years of sci-fi stories involving mind-controlling aliens, holodecks, Matrixes, and the like, the notion of an artificial reality created by an alien intelligence seems a bit old hat. BUT ... In 1972, Solaris was groundbreaking, thoughtful sci-fi of a sort rarely seen on the big screen. Yes, Kubrick's ""2001"" was cerebral and had some similar elements (think of the aged astronaut in the bleached-out white room near the end) and the Star Trek TV series had some mind-control episodes (e.g., the reworked pilot that had the crippled Captain Pike choosing to remain on Talos IV where the alien illusionists could make him believe he was whole and in the company of his beautiful lover), but as a general rule the theme of Solaris had been rarely explored. A few observations: 1) This is a very long movie that, at times, is needlessly tedious (though it's absorbing and engaging most of the time) so try to watch it on a Saturday afternoon when you can stretch out and savor it; 2) This is a film worth watching twice. Tarkovsky loads his scenes with imagery that flow from scene to scene and its hard to catch it all at once. Actually, if you get this on DVD, watch it a third time on 150%. You'll still get the subtitles and the story will seem to make more sense. There are a number of plot holes in the story but, ultimately, they don't lessen your enjoyment because Solaris is not so much about plot as it is about theme and imagery; 3) Some of the stranger elements in the film are explained by production limitations -- some scenes are in brilliant color, others in subdued color and some in black and white. Tarkovsky's artistic intent was shaped by the mundane fact that he had barely enough film to shoot the movie and what he had was a mix of black and white, some mediocre Soviet color film and a little high quality Kodak stock; 4) Finally, Tarkovsky watched 2001 before shooting Solaris and expressly said he intended to make his movie look different, but see if you agree with me that many of the lighting elements, scene compositions, and tracking shots are very 2001-esque.",Solaris
150,ethanj-41027,"Tarkovsky's ""Artistic Failure""",8,17 April 2020,"Solaris (1972) - [8/10]I am disappointed. This film could have been so much better than what it was - it had so much potential. Solaris (1972) was Andrei Tarkovsky's least favorite film that he made, and I agree. I gave this film an 8/10 but in reality I gave it a 78% (I just round up or down when converting the percentage into my ?/10 ratings). My reasoning for that rating is the fact that it lacked emotion that was needed, style, personal-ness, and (most importantly) art that Tarkovsky religiously includes in his films. It was very entertaining, thoughtful, and overall quite great, but it wasn't a ""Tarkovsky"" film (for the record all Tarkovsky films are really, really good. Some are simply more amazing than the rest, and some are just less amazing. Regardless, they're all considered to be spectacular works of cinema and I highly recommend watching at least one in your lifetime.) Solaris (1972) was the film that put Andrei Tarkovsky on the map, and this saddens me. If only Andrei Rublev (1966) hadn't gone through so many issues in being showcased globally (as well as throughout the Soviet Union in most places). That could have been the first film that introduced the world to Andrei Tarkovsky, but it wasn't. I consider Andrei Rublev (1966) to be a perfect masterpiece, and I think it's probably one of my favorite films ever made, so to see this film and put myself in the place of someone who had never seen a Tarkovsky film, let alone even heard his name, makes me upset. They would have gotten a completely different definition of who Andrei Tarkovsky was than if the world could have been introduced to him from Andrei Rublev (1966). Solaris (1972) wasn't made for the right reasons. Andrei Rublev (1966) had cost so much time, money, and stress for Tarkovsky because it hadn't made back any of it's budget - because it hadn't gotten a wide release (!!!!). To add insult to injury, the film Tarkovsky wanted to make at that time (and the screenplay he had written) was rejected - he would later make that film as The Mirror (1975). This placed Tarkovsky in a tough spot. He couldn't make the film he wanted to make, and the film he spent years making hadn't made a dime (it was later released globally in 1973). So, he had to make a choice: adapt the highly successful novel, Solaris (1961), that guaranteed commercial success or to not make a film for a very long time - and obviously he chose the former. I don't blame him at all for choosing to make Solaris (1972). He set out to bring emotional depth to the science-fiction genre (of which he really didn't like in the first place) with this film. It was received exceptionally well, and it makes sense. On one side of the spectrum, there was Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) and then there was Andrei Tarkovsky's Solaris (1972). Tarkovsky did not see Kubrick's film until after this comparison was made. He felt that 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) was too lifeless and sterile. Both films are made quite well and tell different stories about space. Kubrick tells a story of humanity (and the loss of it) through space travel, and Tarkovsky tells a story of love (and the loss of it) through space. There are certain aspects about both films that I prefer over the other (and some that are even similar to each other), but I think to compare them is impossible. Solaris (1972) has excellent cinematography (from Vadim Yusov of course), a very complex story, and some good performances. But overall something doesn't sit well with me. (I'm sorry I haven't really talked about the film too much, and if this review doesn't really help in explaining whether or not you should see it, definitely do. It's a slow burn, but totally worth it. If you're into Sci-Fi, it's a must see. Picture The Shining's (1980) hallucination scenes in space.) I think the best way to describe how I feel about this film (and I think how Tarkovsky felt filming this) is one particular scene. Kris Kelvin (Donatas Banionis) tries to wrap his head around what is truly happening to himself and fellow crew mates, as a result of the planet Solaris. We cut to him standing against a shelf, his entire body shifted towards an none other than an Andrei Rublev icon. He stares at this icon with an expression difficult to describe. An expression of sadness, but with a sense of regret, longing, and despair. A ""What have I done?"" look. Given all the circumstances around this film, Tarkovsky is clearly trying to tell us something. He's pained with the fact that his masterpiece, Andrei Rublev (1966), hasn't been released to a greater audience and is saddened by the fact that he has to make the very film he dislikes (Sci-Fi films) to make The Mirror (1975). He included this scene because he regrets choosing to film Solaris (1972), an ""artistic failure"" (his words not mine), and not being able to film The Mirror (1975). (Even the quote I chose can be compared to my claim that Tarkovsky did not like this film. He writes that ""We need a mirror."" to be held up to the human race, not to look to other worlds.) I think the biggest issue Tarkovsky had was that all of his iconic shot techniques were taken away with the setting of space. Typically Tarkovsky includes metaphors of nature and Earth in his films, but how are you able to do that in space? How are you able to capture the beauty of nature in a place devoid of that very thing? His poetic cinema style was forced to be replaced with techniques that did not ""transcend its genre"". Andrei Rublev (1966) is able to balance entertainment and art, creating an incredibly involved epic as well as an incredibly artistic film. Solaris (1972) is very entertaining (at times I was on the edge of my seat), but it sacrificed art for entertainment. Solaris (1972) is a science-fiction classic that captures a unique story of love and mystery, but fails to produce the same artistic style, emotion, personal-ness , and mastery that Tarkovsky is known for.",Solaris

154,mligorio,We Are God,8,19 January 2012,"Solaris is an extraterrestrial intelligence. As remote as imaginable from humanity, it is nevertheless the very essence of human nature which, paradoxically, is an alien. Or, rather, our inability to understand our own nature alienates us from ourselves and others. Solaris is the mysterious workings of the human psyche. All the desolation and chaos therein stem from our efforts to either destroy or abandon what we can neither understand nor control.Kris Kelvin is able to communicate with it by probing his own mind. Essentially, his private thoughts, memories and dreams are reproduced in a physical form that he can actually speak to and reason with. Unfortunately, this physical manifestation of his imagination, Hari, is all too human in that it has no knowledge of what created it. To go beyond this limitation and truly understand our own origins, it is necessary to become one with Solaris. But, possessed by an almost paranoid fear of the unknown, Kris is reluctant to surrender himself unconditionally. That is, until he finally realizes that in order to grow as an individual, he needs to share his experiences with others. In effect, Kris needs love.For all our great knowledge, the origin of life has remained a mystery. And, if we do not even know what life is to begin with, how can we ever expect to find it elsewhere in the cosmos? To fulfill our own destiny, we must journey not through space, but rather through the timeless void that is our own subconscious. Life, after all, is a physical manifestation of thought, and with the power of our imagination we will forever preserver, and ever be capable of raising ourselves to ever still higher levels of conscious.",Solaris
155,seventh_samurai54,A stunning achievement.,10,2 January 2003,"Andrei Tarkovsky's Solaris is in a very small group of the greatest film ever made. Going into this movie, I didn't know what to expect. I had heard it was ""Russia's answer to Kubrick's 2001"". Well, in certain ways it's better. Based on Stanislaw Lem's novel of the same name, Solaris is a science-fiction film like no other. It concerns a psychologist named Kris Kelvin (brilliantly played by Donatas Baninois), who is sent to a space station which is orbiting the water planet of Solaris. Kelvin is sent there because they've lost contact with the crew. What follows is pure cinematic beauty. The cinematography is brilliant (Vadim Yusov). Tarkovsky sets the mood so well, with subtle camera movements. He lets the viewer absorb the scene, instead of using a lot of needless editing.

Tarkowski found an end which still brings a shiver to my back. Although I ""know"" that we cannot make the earth as big as the space or find the immortality somewhere outside.Somehow it feels like Philip Glass knew the Music of Eduard Artemev. And Natalya Bondarchuk is so very beautiful... one of the few in cinema, this essentially belongs to my personal review. This special beauty I saw again only in Jodie Fosters play of Eleanor Arroway in ""Contact"" by Robert Zemeckis.Remember: it was the time mankind looked for evidences for the last fundamental force of nature, the weak force; the only force that violates parity-symmetry, and it was found one year after Solyaris.1997 the father of Ellie Arroway - materialized from her memories - said, that the only thing to stand this emptiness is 'each other' Andreji Tarkowski left us with a very important issue: it's not possible to distinguish between reality and memory without each other, and that this is the key to find a way how to learn to love the whole manhood - after discovering the basics of nature.He found a way to say this in the middle of the cold war.

Exceptional job done by Andrei Tarkovsky, screenplay and the direction as he has never failed to impress, though some of his trademarks were missing from the frame, didn't get to see much of his long takes and dipping water sounds and close-ups of debris moreover I was hoping to see more of Mr. Arseniy Tarkovsky's pleasant poetry and heartwarming quotes but Solaris is more of a self-explanatory picture than words (like a talking photograph) whereas Stalker (1979) and Zerkalo (1975) are vice versa.To me Tarkovsky's idea of a perfect movie completely differs than the thoughts of a perfectionist, Tarkovsky has never used the same idea again in his work. Stalker was about hope (true or false your choice) Zerkalo was about life and Solaris is about choices.For sensible audience this movie has to be the best movie ever made and if anyone finds this movie boring or to slow-paced, tedious then I guess they can never understand what art-cinema is all about.PS: The only reason why I didn't give any Stanislaw Lem's reference is because after completion Lem thought that Tarkovsky didn't do a good job matter fact Lem thought that Tarkovsky has blown his novels whole idea.Two thumbs up ""A solid 10/10""",Solaris

Visually it is a thing of beauty, and it is a rare thing - a film which requires input from the viewer. This movie requires you to think for yourself...and some people find that difficult.I enjoy a rip-snorting entertaining action movie as much as most people, but rare films like Solaris leave me feeling so much more fulfilled. There are ambiguities, not so much loose ends untied as dots which the viewer is required to connect for himself.Try Solaris.

It can be violent to your mind, without showing a single violent image (by the way, I often see this movie as a counterpart to Clockwork Orange, even more than to 2001). It can stun you, with ten or twenty minutes of incomprehensible silence. It can deprive you of any certainty in the laws of nature - such as, people only die once - and thus leave you vulnerable and naked.I know that many friends to whom I've shown this move did not understand it.

Solyaris is hardly a movie in anything but the technical sense. It is a series of episodes that fit together in a story about a single man's journey in both figurative and literal senses. Whoever watches this film will be gambling that the emotional rewards will outweigh the three hour investment and many viewers will lose. Those who don't will experience some of the most poignant moments ever committed to film- pain, joy, hope, and despair.It is a cheaply made film with numerous continuity, plot, and photography shortfalls. The film is black and white for a few short sequences and, supposedly, the reason is quite simple- there wasn't enough colour film stock. There are also significant variations amid the different colour film stocks used for the film. While artistry may have been used to make the most of these changes, the changes were due to the same economic constraints that kept the sets simple, rough, and, at times, hardly futuristic. This lack of polish actually suits the subjects of the film- which is human emotion and perception. The ""science fiction"" aspects of the story are merely vehicles for studying human emotion and perception- it allows the hypothetical to become actual. In this case, the main character is able to experience rather than merely imagine being reunited with his long-dead wife while, yet, still knowing that the experience is not real. Or is it real? Or, at least, is it real in the ways that matter? The viewer decides along with the main character. This contemplation of what is real and important to an particular person is one of the central issue of the film.The movie lends itself quite well to being watched in parts and nobody should be the least bit ashamed for not watching it in one sitting- such is more than most people can do.

I do not believe that these scenes conveyed any more meaning or cause for thought than if they had been half as long. Many mention the long car ride scene.

181,andrewoliver-04063,Highly thought provoking film,10,24 February 2019,"I first saw this film years ago when Alex Cox showed it on tv one night and its caught my imagination ever since then. From the start of the haunting main theme to the first scenes of nature I could tell that this was going to be a lot different to other sci-fi I had seen before it. The film explores how a sentient ocean probes the minds of the scientists and manifests visitors of the individual minds in perhaps a way to communicate with them. Of course wether we see this a blessing,curse or something to be feared is another matter as that's not something that's answered only by the individuals concerned as the film shows. Perhaps in order to ever hoping ever to understand any alien lifeform maybe we have to look and understand our species as a whole and we haven't done that yet. As sci-fi and a love story works perfectly on both levels and the slow pacing gives you the time to think of whats said or visually seen, its certainly got much thought in the making of this.
Frankly so much better than the 2002 remake with George Clooney in it and the original Russian tv film is ok but a bit stagey as the film needs time to explore the storyline better. I like the use of the color and b&w scenes reminescint of A Matter of Life and Death and reminds me of color for the real World b&w for the surreal one. This film is often compared to Kubricks 2001 only in the sense of thought provoking and you need to make up your own answers however the storylines are totally different this makes you care more for the characters for a start and explores humanity far more and perhaps why love plays such an important part in our lives no matter what the context and why it means so much to us.

183,alexcornas,"Tarkovsky's only failure, his weakest film but still a good one",7,26 February 2019,"Solaris, adapted from the science-fiction novel by Polish writer Stanislaw Lem, is Tarkovsky weakest film and, in his own words, his only failure. The story is simple, it is a science-fiction story set in a near future where Human kind has started its exploration of the Galaxy. Within their exploration, they've stumbled upon Solaris, a planet who seems alive. For decades, scientists have been trying to study the planet. As the researchs have all been inconclusive and costly, Kelvin, a psychologue, is sent to the Human station on Solaris to report on the last 3 scientists studying the planet, and, ultimately, decide whether or not research on Solaris must be abandoned.Upon stepping on the station, he learns that the only scientist he knew, Gibarian, has committed suicide. He died because of shame. What shame? The shame of the Human presumption to be willing to learn about other alien intelligence when we do not understand the human soul ourselves. Kelvin quickly realises that it isn't men who are studying Solaris, but Solaris who is studying Human kind.The movie mainly fails because of the lack of material. Tarkovsky's cinema is based on emotions that can be transmitted without words to the viewers. However, it proved impossible for the viewer to antagonise with the 2nd main character of the movie, Solaris impersonation of Kelvin's wife, simply because we know very early on that she is not human nor alive.Tarkovsky will learn from his mistake in choosing the wrong material with his next and perhaps greatest film: Mirror. Mirror is the anti-Solaris, it is the response the movie had been seeking for, it is about the human soul, in this film, the world is Tarkovsky's oyster and, spurred on by the contraints of Solaris weak material, he makes the most of it.Solaris is Tarkovsky's only failure because it fails to live up to the artist's principles. Tarkovsky's cinema is based about created material to spur the viewer's emotion, intelligence and interpretation. In Solaris, we feel no emotion, some intelligence, but we are left with only one straight forward interpretation.This is why it is Tarkosky's weakest entry. Anyone really interested in the great director should probably start by Nostalgia or The Sacrifice which are accessible movies and bear everything of the essence of Tarkovsky as an artist, perhaps the greatest artist of the last Century.",Solaris

186,rasmushelms,A Masterpiece of Art-house Cinema,10,28 May 2014,"""Solaris"" is a stunning film in every sense of the word. Although perhaps more plot- oriented than anything else he ever made, ""Solaris"" is still unmistakably a Tarkovsky film. The dreamlike way in which the camera moves, the long takes, and the wonderful imagery is all there. So is the symbolism and deeply philosophical dialogue, which asks so many questions to the audience that the film needs multiple viewings to be fully appreciated.The film, based on the novel by Stanislaw Lem, follows psychologist Kris Kelvin (Donatas Banionis) who is sent to a space station orbiting the planet Solaris to evaluate the mental state of the remaining crew members after mysterious occurrences have caused some members to go insane, in order to determine whether the operation should continue. It's an interesting premise, and makes for a fascinating character study as the planet's recreation of Kris' dead ex-wife, Hari (Natalya Bondarchuk), leads him to question what he wants from his life: to live in a dream with the planet's fabrication of Hari, or to return to his real life on Earth. As important as the story is the way the film is crafted. Andrei Tarkovsky is the master of creating visual poetry, and from the first frame this is clear. The gorgeous shots of nature and running water establish the importance the concept of nature will have in the film, and juxtaposes the mysterious, foreign ocean of Solaris. The film is drenched in mood, eliciting feelings of melancholy and nostalgia, as Kris re-encounters Hari in Solaris. Also crucial to creating the film's atmosphere is the music. A chorale prelude by Johann Sebastian Bach is featured multiple times throughout the film and mirrors the inner feelings of Kris Kelvin. Meanwhile, the score by Eduard Artemev helps craft the unsettling aura that the mysterious ocean of Solaris emits. The excellent performances by the actors, especially Natalya Bondarchuk, are also crucial to the film's emotional scope.Ultimately, the virtuosity of Tarkovsky's direction makes ""Solaris"" a beautiful, spiritual film that resonates in the soul. The film builds up wonderfully towards its haunting conclusion, and lingers on in the mind for days. Its a phenomenal artistic achievement, although the slow pace and philosophical nature of the film means that it definitely will not appeal to the mainstream audience. However, for fans of art-house cinema, ""Solaris"" takes the viewer on an epic, emotional experience. Its a masterpiece, and one of my favorite films of all time.",Solaris

This is one of the few films I have ever seen that I am still thinking about 10 years after first seeing it. I will not go into the depths of the storyline because anyone willing to go on this journey for the first time deserves to see it without spoilers. Needless to say, as many other people have said before, this film speaks to the heart of what it means to be a conscious sentient being and asks you to think about what reality is to you and what you are willing to accept it is. If you like this you may like Tarkovsky's other work but none can touch the majesty of this piece which should be on the national curriculum. Oh, and there is a dodgy scene with a dwarf.",Solaris
188,liersenic,http://tgtbtw.blogspot.com/,10,13 January 2012,"Another work of art by the genius Tarkovsky, Solaris. There since has been an American remake with the very famous George Clooney, although I find Tarkovsky's to be in a whole other league of films. Like many of his films, Solaris without ever saying to much, can really make you think and dive deep into the story. It is extremely easy to get lost into the story and I found myself many times trying to answer the questions that are brought up in this film.I have heard many describe Solaris as a close relative to Kubricks 2001: A Space Odyssey, but in the Criterion version of Solaris, Akira Kurosawa states that Tarkovsky found 2001 to be ""cold and sterile."" Even though 2001 is a wonderful film, Solaris is filled with so much more human emotion, grief, love, hate, etc, where as for me, 2001 concentrated more on the hard science aspect of the film. I wonder if this could be the reason Tarkovsky wanted to make Solaris, because he wanted to do a science fiction film correct in his eyes? Regardless of why he did it, Tarkovsky himself ended up not enjoying it, and became his least favorite film to make.Much like Stalker (1979), this film is not filled with much hope. From the moment the film begins in the prologue, we see that our protagonist, Kris Kelvin, is upset and filled with grief. It seems as if his trip to the Solaris station is more of an escape rather than a mission for his work. Kris wanting to leave earth is the main reason why some of the scenes in the opening of the film might feel like they drag on, but that was done for a reason. It is Kris' final day on earth, and this could very possibly be his last. Tarkovsky was showing off nature to the viewers as if it was our last day here. He was wanting us to take in every leaf blown in the wind, every cloud in the sky, and even when Kris arrives at the Solaris station, the other Solaris' most missed possession is the wind.As the film progresses Kris begins to learn that the reason he was sent here is not so far fetched after all. The planet they are orbiting is known to harbor some sort of intelligent life, whether it be physical or just biological. The intelligent life somehow can understand what is in your deepest part of your conscious and actually reveal that to you. The intelligent life teaches us that the reason Kris is filled with so much grief is because the loss of his wife. So of course the second day that Kris is on the Solaris station, the intelligent life brings to him his wife. To some this may seem like a miracle, but as Kris slowly finds out, it is only going to bring him more grief. Kris' wife, Hari, still remembers everything, including her suicide. She wrestles with the idea that she is not the real Hari, but a duplicate created by Kris' imagination.Solaris has one of the most conflict filled love stories, and is told so well through the experiences that each of the characters go through while on the Solaris station. Kris has to constantly struggle whether to leave the station forever and never see Hari again, or to forever stay there and live with the ""phenomenon"" Hari, because the moment they live the orbit of that planet the scientific phenomenon vanishes. My favorite line from this movie, and one of my favorite quotes of all time is said by Dr. Snaut on the station when talking about what is actually going on in the planets space ocean.""We don't know what to do with other worlds. We don't need other worlds. We need a mirror. We struggle to make contact, but we'll never achieve it. We are in a ridiculous predicament of man pursuing a goal that he fears and that he really does not need. Man needs man!"" Dr. Snaut is trying to tell Kris, that even though there is something mysterious and powerful going on in this planet, we do not need it. We were put here on earth to discover other humans, to get to know our fellow species better. We do not need clones of the ones we used to love to make us happy, that is why we have memories. Dr. Snaut is telling Kris to go back to earth, back to his family, and try and get to know new people, that is what will relieve Kris of his grief.For those who have not seen this film, you must. If films like 2001 bore you, than I guess watch the remake because it is a much shorter film, but there is a reason for that. It leaves out a lot of really great scenes between Kris and Hari, and from what I recall the ending is nowhere near the same. The ending to Tarkovsky's Solaris is one of my favorite endings, it stunned me the first time I saw it. I honestly don't think I have ever been disappointed by a Tarkovsky film, but Solaris is my favorite from him.",Solaris
189,sophiavladimirovna,"Brilliant, deeply symbolic sci-fi",10,15 March 2009,"I usually take books far more seriously than the films based on them, especially books as deep and poetic as 'Solaris'. But for me, this film is a complete exception to the rule.This film is an intriguing odyssey into the depths of the human soul - the isolation aboard a space station orbiting a mysterious planet with a single jelly-like organism covering it, is a metaphor for places within ourselves where we do not dare to tread; our deepest, darkest secrets and desires. Throughout the film, we watch characters searching for a purpose in their lives, then settling for an illusionary one should they find none. The subtleness of the story means that it may take multiple viewings to understand, but in the end creates a haunting, deeply unsettling masterpiece.Haters of this film have pointed out that it has a very slow pace, and I must say that this is true. But the quiet scenes have a remarkable beauty and symbolism - perhaps the ten-minute scene of a car on a highway represents a loss of purpose and meaning in life? In this age where whole worlds can be created and destroyed via computers, the effects are also slightly less than stunning. So, not to sound patronising or judgemental, but if you like action and effects, go watch Star Wars or Speed Racer and stay away from this film.

Forget all other masterpieces, this tops them all. Each and every performance is of such depth that repeated viewings cannot begin to reveal the details of each frame and moment of Solaris. It is not a difficult movie at all, not by a long shot. It is simple, direct and completely hypnotic. The mystery involved is titillating, the looks on the characters faces priceless, the story as wide open as eternity itself. I have yet to see the re-make, and fear greatly that it will be nothing more than a laughable revisit of an already totally perfect film that asks more questions than it answers while asking of the viewer nothing more than to sit back and swim along with this poetic adventure-a visual delight that takes you from the earth and into space and through the end of your mind.

I don't even understand who it could go out in theatres.I must say this is an unusual Sci-Fi way different then the ones from the US. The actors/actresses look like actors, not playing their role (my favourite is Snaut who looks more like an alcoholic than a Scientist Doctor), what could be a result as they got selected instead of applied and got the job. It made me feel it a bit untrustworthy, but the USSR wasn't the number 1 film producer in the 70's.The story makes absolutely sense. During the cold war both sides spent insane lot of money exploring the space, looking for new planet with live on it, so they created this film showing it to us. And as their looking was unsuccessful, they had to call it Sci-Fi. You watch it, all goes as expected, and when you think it finished you see the last scenes, and you don't understand anymore. Or at least me.The last scene really made me confused and I should watch it again (as many other people recommended), but I didn't find it interesting enough so I just get along and live without the full understanding of one of the greatest Sci-Fis.

It's a romance, yet, it isn't really a romance at all; more of an `artificial' romance. If that doesn't sound strange enough, watch the film. Both Solaris and 2001: a space odyssey share one thing aside from their science fiction roots; they explore mankind in a psychological way.2001 expresses its point visually, taking us on a trip without explaining much. Solaris, at times is very talky, which takes it into a much different direction than the aforementioned film. It leaves much more to the imagination than you might expect. Yes, there are shots of the planet itself, but the conflicts and mystery play out mostly in your head. I like how Tarkovsky is able to make you believe something is happening, when it isn't physically happening. This is a big plus, and makes it all the more remarkable, because you can tell this was done on a small budget, but makes the best of it. Like 2001, it sets up a mystery, past its lengthy exposition, regarding the planet Solaris. The mystery is setup but never solved, and we are still wondering, `what is it?' But that is not the only mystery that drives the film; the other involves the main character, Chris Kelvin, and how he struggles to understand himself, and his love for the woman he lost many years before. And who has been resurrected by some power or ability the planet posesses. There is a great irony in this. Kelvin, a psychologist, is sent to the planet Solaris to do a report on the scientists who are working on a station to see whether the project should be terminated or not. Yet, he himself is the one eventually subjected to being studied.
The scientists are sent to study the planet, but the reason that they haven't, and cannot find a logical explanation to the problem laid down in front of them is that they do not understand themselves. It even occurs at one point in the film where the wisest among the scientists, Snauth, doesn't have all the answers, and he's right. Even in the end, they are still in a state of confusion, but we somehow understand that state of confusion. I don't think Stainslaw Lem, or even Tarkovsky for that matter, set out to answer questions the about humanity, but merely brought the questions and ideas forth to present them in a way that we might understand that not everything can be explained. We are limited as human beings. The final shot demonstrates that, as it pulls slowly away to reveal an image that I will never forget.Tarkovsky brings the film both hauntingly and beautifully together. Not only does he do that, but his camerawork is slow and contemplative. It baffles me how someone like him can be that patient. He was one of a kind; a visual poet, a master at bringing art to the screen, yet his filmography only spans 7 films. I read that he considered this to be the weakest of all his films, but that isn't saying much. It draws you in by your curiosity, and never releases its grip til the end. It is one of the greatest among science fiction films; complex, mindbending, beautiful, and haunting. A great film.****1/2 or (9/10)",Solaris
197,Gerionas,"""When film is not a document, it is dream. That is why Tarkovsky is the greatest of them all.""",9,31 May 2011,"There are only two film directors in the world whose every movie haunts me and causes insomnia every time I watch it. One of them is A. Tarkovsky – a true auteur and genius who made 7 films that are considered to be masterpieces (another is the author of the reviews title). Among these films brightly shines a science fiction mystery Solaris. It is a breathtaking story about a man's journey to cosmos to seek knowledge about an alien intelligence and more importantly to understand himself and the nature of the humankind. The main stars of the movie are Lithuanian D. Banionis, Estonian J. Järvet and Russians A. Solonitsyn and N. Bondarchuk.Solaris is known for its slow and gradual prelude. Prelude lasts for 40 minutes and takes place on Earth. During it, we are introduced to the main character – psychologist Kris Kelvin (Donatas Banionis) who is shown as a profound person tormented by his own thoughts. He agrees to go on a mission to a base established near a planet that appears to have some kind of intelligence on it. At first Kelvin seems to be skeptical about it but his approach radically changes when he comes on the base and meets members of the crew Dr. Snaut (Juri Jarvet), Dr. Sartorius (Anatoli Solonitsyn) and Dr. Gibarian (Sos Sargsyan). They are acting very bizarre and soon Kelvin finds out the reason of this strange behavior. He realizes that the planet is able to materialize people's thoughts. Kelvin tries to understand what does the planet wants from them, what makes human a human and many others scientific, moral and philosophical problems.A. Tarkovsky's masterpiece has to be watched more than just one time because of its complex themes and problems. Solaris complexity is the reason why this movie stands out of all science fiction movies and is timeless. It tries to make viewers think about the human kind and invites to an open debate about the deepest feelings and fears of humans. Film also deals with the theme of remorse and the problem of not being capable to escape from your own thoughts. Quotes of L. Tolstoy are citied on more than one occasion and there are some references to Don Quixote written by M. Cervantes. Moreover, the whole story can be seen as an attempt of humankind to understand and to be understood by the higher intelligence (or even God if you want to name it).Another thing that makes this movie so special is its visual beauty and eerie mood. No matter where the action is taking place or if it is filmed in color of B/W it is still stunning. A. Tarkovsky manages to show the beauty of countryside (prelude), city (ride on streets of the future Moscow) and science fiction features (from the design of the base to the magnificent ocean of the planet) in the same movie. Even though the film is visually beautiful, the viewer is not always able to relax and admire it. This is because A. Tarkovsky attains so paranoid and eerie mood that it makes some parts of the movie look like scenes from a horror movie. He achieves it with the help of haunting composition of J. S. Bach (""Ich ruf' zu dir, Herr Jesu Christ"") which becomes the movie score.To sum up, Solaris is a thought provoking masterpiece that has an overwhelming visuals and a haunting score. It is not designed for a regular viewer and Tarkovsky expects a lot of wisdom from his viewer. However, I consider Solaris to be one of the best science fiction movies ever made and I believe that it should be viewed by every self-respected movie buff at least twice.2011-05-31",Solaris
198,jasonford1987,Definitely in my top three.,10,25 December 2009,"I'm a big science fiction fan. I very much enjoy the cerebral involvement that comes with the genre - or SHOULD, at least. I enjoy it even more when it has an emotional context. Good science fiction is still largely confined to the library in my opinion, but there are some good films. Solyaris is among the best.I've only seen it once. Last night it was on Netflix and it looked good so I watched it. I'm VERY glad I was able to stumble upon this movie. For me science fiction is mostly about the concept. I want my mind to be challenged. The story is very important definitely, but I appreciate an imaginative, creative, and intelligent concept above all else, and this movie delivers.I think a lot of people miss an important detail about this movie, one which is central to my interpretation of it. The guests are NOT hallucinations or ghosts, or anything abstract. They are matter, and they're really there - just like you and I. Sure they are explained to be made of neutrinos and not true flesh and bone, but it's really all the same at it's core. Wouldn't Kris agree? To me the most substantial conclusion to be drawn from this film is it's existential dealings, specifically with our human perception of life. We are organized matter convulsing and reacting to chemicals. That is the scientific view. There is nothing abstract in the makeup of who we are. So really are we only imitating ""life?"" What was Hari's reproduction? Organized matter imitating life. Not as aptly as a human, because it wasn't human - but was that the only true difference between her and the ""real"" Hari? Kris felt love for the reproduction very strongly. But wouldn't that be a natural thing to occur since after all, love is only a chemical - matter reacting to matter? At the end we see Kris back on Earth, returning to his home. However he is actually on a large scale reproduction which is one of the islands formed by the Ocean. But how could Kris ever know the difference? Your loved ones, your home, your emotions, your memories and this world are made up of matter that can be reproduced. Physical material... does it end there?",Solaris
199,WanaxOdysseus,Russia's 2001,10,26 June 2012,"I think this film is a serious competitor to the title ""best science fiction movie ever"". At the very least, it could be seen as Russian cinema's equivalent to 2001. Is it slow? Yes. But the pay off at the end is immense. Those who can summon the patience to sit through the film will know why. Those who can't should learn the patience needed, because to not see this to miss out on one of the most iconic moments in cinematic history, I should think.When I say science-fiction, by the way, do not expect lots of lasers and fancy special effects. 2001 is much more science fictiony than this one in that respect. Even so, the plot and the climax can leave no doubt about the films science fiction credentials.",Solaris
200,918,Just A SciFi film like Forbiden Planet,3,16 April 2009,"Solaris was my first Tarkovsky movie. I got the Criterion Edition, and read the companion booklet first. And I was very sure I was going to like this film. I read reviews here and again was reassured I was going to like it. Some of my most favorite films are slow thinking movies, I love Michaelangelo Antonioni's movies, Bergman's movies, Godard's films, and I love 2001 space odyssey. I enjoy the more symbolic expressions of cinema in general. For instance the way Coppola cuts together the sacrifice of the bull with the murder of Kurtz in apocalypse now.So i was very excited and sure that Solaris was going to be great. I watched it and I thought it was terrible. And I am someone who will acknowledge or give respect to a film even if I don't personally ""enjoy"" it or am ""entertained"" by it but I thought this was bad.1.) Color to black and white: Later on in the movie the film stock changes to black and white to better illustrate dream sequences... but Tarkovsky is not consistent with this approach because earlier on in the film it changes to black and white for no reason. Am I missing something here? 2.) Cheap production: their is countless flaws in many different aspects, for instance the terrible zoom shots, and panning shots look very amateurish. The sound was terrible as well many times there would be no sound effects for obvious things like a car's engine. This film was made after 2001 and its FX aren't even close to being on the same level.3.) Too long with too few ideas: Being long alone doesn't mean anything really. Tarkovsky gives you plenty of time to understand what the main characters problem is. The character is told for nearly two hours that his wife isn't real, and I understand that the drama of the film is created out of the tension of knowing that the relationship doesn't exist, and that the main character only wants it to but for two hours! This isn't a mind bending concept that calls for such obsession. I think that the audience understands the problem within a half an hour.4.) Bad ending: to make matters worse the problem or conflict that arises for two hours of the film is resolved in a very anti climactic way. After he has came to terms with his loss she simply isn't seen again.5.) Tarkovsky's failure I don't see any evidence of metaphysical Pudovkin editing techniques. or Igmar Bergman symbolism, or even any sort of response to 2001.The few discussions about philosophy and life are pretty stock discussions and aren't really that interesting or in relevance with the plot.The levitation sequence isn't anywhere near as effective as it seems in Tarkovsky's sacrifice.6.) Solaris is a SciFi movie... nothing more: In comparison to 2001 Tarkovsky's Solaris dwells more in human emotion... that's true but so does Forbidden Planet which I found more similar to Solaris than 2001.I may have been expecting too much, or expecting the wrong thing from this film but I was severely disappointed. The ""surprise"" ending was not much of a surprise, and not very thought provoking. It seemed almost like an ending found on the Twilight Zone.Solaris involves some thought, there is a few interesting ideas, but its not groundbreaking or a masterpiece, and the idea that this film is even considered to be linked to 2001 is silly.7.) A few good points: having said that i don't mean to bash the entire film. I found the first hour very interesting and engaging. I didn't mind the nature shots. The car scene, I thought, was one of the best sequences shot, edited and scored pieces of the movie though I have no idea what it had to do with the plot. One review on the board suggested that it shows how the astronaut has nowhere to go... okay... so what though? What does it matter? In contrast the nature shots seem to serve importance because Nature will be severely missed by the astronauts. but an astronaut/2ndary character driving around in a car because he has nowhere to go? 8.) In conclusion: The cinematography was cheap, the pacing of the film was completely silly. Not once in 2001 is Kubric being slow just for the sake of being slow. there are 3 or 4 minute shots of nothing but spaceships spinning but the FX and cinematography are breathtaking.Solaris is tediously slow and the few ideas and themes that are brought up are spelled out just as clearly as most Kate Winslet movies. And the film is cheap. Tarkovsky obviously didn't have enough money. The movie goes from color to black and white for no reason, the sound design is terrible. The acting is pretty shaky, and the FX are terrible. There are no real twists or turns in plot, the film just doesn't ever take off.Like I said this was my first Tarkovsky film. But I considered it extremely overrated. i read other comments before posting to see if maybe I missed something. one person included clues for viewing Solaris the algae, the car, the ending, all of which I understood pretty matter-of-factually after the first viewing.Please if I'm missing something here i would like to know just what everyone likes about this film so I can at least respect it.",Solaris
201,thomaseastmand,Truth in Nature,9,29 July 2019,"Tarkovsky has a way of capturing nature that is unparalleled. Every depiction feels expansive yet reserved. Silence is emphasized because the beauty of every frame speaks volumes. The length of each shot provides a feeling of calm catharsis, not unlike that of a Pre-Ralphaelite painting, in the sense that there is fundamental and poetic truth to be found in nature. In this film, Tarkovsky puts this to question by thrusting viewers into a world in which nature is void of truth; serving as an existential contrast to his other works.",Solaris
202,rexillusivii,Tarkovsky's Solaris is a twin of Kubrick's 2001: slow but thoughtful,8,23 June 2005,"ATTENTION IMDb EDITORS: I have tried not reveal or spoil the end of the movie for those who did not watch it, but if you think I have spoilt it, keep the ""spoiler"" warning. =======================================Why is it so good? You must watch and see the end of the movie to understand why is Andrei Tarkovsky's vision of the Stanislaw Lem's novel truly amazing in several aspects. First: It takes some time to comprehend what really happens in the novel, written by a scientist deeply convinced that humans will never find another intelligence in the Universe, although Lem did his best to prove otherwise. Second: Tarkovsky did not focus so much on strangeness of the Solaris as much he did on human psychology. As not seen in either of the two Solaris screen versions, but was beautifully described in the novel, the planet is an emotional child trying to fulfil wishes of its visitors, who are themselves emotionally adult but have serious fears and regrets of their past deeds (only to expressively shown through Hari character). Third: Andrei Tarkovsky has had a very specific visual language: he used colour as an expression of emotions (Watched ""Andrei Rublyov""? It's full-length B/W until the very end when colours speak or should we say scream from the screen). Then, the atmosphere at the habitat is skillfully blended into the movie: loneliness, lack of communication, silence, boredom, day-dreaming, philosophical questioning of everybody and everything. The only true special effect scene in the movie is the passage through low gravity, when Kris and another reproduced ""Hari"" stay together. One important element of the Lem's story was blissfully ignored both by Tarkovsky and Steven Soderbergh (2002 version): Solaris came to be intelligent ocean because its two suns (a red giant and a blue dwarf) have prevented formation of any other form of life. Four: to tell an introspection story in attractive way was hard even for Soderbergh who had much advanced technology 30 years on. Five: the very ending scene in the 1972 movie reveals how unfathomable is the world of Solaris: Kris decides to go home, but will he reach his destination any time soon?",Solaris
203,toshikk,A few comments on how to watch it,10,23 March 2003,"One of the users in his/her comment to the 2002 adaptation of Lem's novel said that this types of movies should be given a new rating, BRBV (or Brain Required Before Viewing).Unfortunately, I have not seen the Sodebergh's version of ""Solaris"" (I'm pretty sure it can't beat this one, but, given what other people think about it, I can tell that it's worth seeing), but I can assure you that the same can be applied to this movie too.Guys, it's not boring; it is SLOW. There's a huge difference between the two. Boring movies (Daredevil and Attack of the Clones, for instance) make you fall asleep, good slow movies make you think. If you are a kind of person that comes to movie theater just to see some blood and guts on the screen while chewing on buttery popcorn (popcorn eaters are, probably, my biggest pet peeve when it comes to going to the movies here, in the US - there's always some guy sitting right next to you, eating it so loud that you can't hear a darn thing...), this is not a movie for you. And as for those of you who don't fall into that category - well, you also have to be in the right mood for it. If you are constantly thinking about something important that you have to do or if there is a lot of people making a lot of noise around you - don't watch it; you're still going to like it, but you'll lose a lot. You have to concentrate on the movie, it should be the only thing on your mind. Just sit back and... no, not enjoy. Think. Then you'll enjoy it.I am not going to restate the entire plot of the movie, for a lot of people have already done it. Instead, I'm going to try to give you a few clues about some confusing moments in the movie. (Yes, SPOILERS, if that's what you want to call them).1) Oh, that ""boring, boring, boring"" car ride scene. Attention, popcorn lovers - this is not 21st century Moscow (in fact, it's never mentioned, where the ""Earth"" part of the movie takes place - it can be Japan as well...). This is not supposed to give you the insight of what the future is like. It is there for one simple reason - to show you that the astronaut in the car, as well as all other characters in the movie, has got nowhere to go. It's all just an endless road.2) Seaweed - it just stands for nature, Earth, as the characters know it. It's there for a reason too, not just to bore the hell out of you.3)The final scene - Kris is not on Earth. He's on Solaris. He himself is a part of the planet's giant ""thinking"" Ocean now, just like Harey was.
Once again - forget about this movie if you like action the most. Go watch Daredevil or wait till the new Matrix comes out. For all others - watch it, it's a sure 10/10.",Solaris

It may or may not happen :-P) The scenes that particularly stay in my head is the opening scene of the first part, the space station and particularly the birthday celebration in the library.Overall it holds as much relevance now as it held 40 years back, and would keep holding for probably as much time from now.",Solaris

I didn't like it, my wife didn't like it and I don't think many in the audience liked it.It may have meanings on many levels, but on the level of entertainment, it does not show us the goods. It is SLOOOOOOOOOOW. How about 10 minutes of film devoted to characters driving on the freeways of Moscow (which actually was a Japanese freeway because you can see billboards in Japanese--guess Moscow in 1971 did not look modern enough). 10 minutes that has nothing to do with the movie. The movie starts with the film showing reeds under water flowing with the current. Even this scene, which should last a minute or two lasted almost 10 minutes of no dialog, and you don't have a clue what is going on. I may be dull or dense, but I need some stimulation in the opening of a movie to get me interested. This director is not interested in getting you hooked on the film. He obviously had no constraints on how much film he could expose, edit, or show on the big screen.The LA Times review compared this space film with the effects of 2001. On a scale of 1 to 100 (where 2001 was a hundred (for its time)), Solaris would rate a 10. There is a very simple space scene, a very simple rocket take off, and that is about it for special effects. There is a view of the Solaris Ocean, but looks more like water spiraling down a drain.There may be lots of subliminal stories going on here, but this movie is sure not compelling or interesting to me (could you guess by this time?). My wife felt like she was watching a David Lynch film as there were unexplained dwarfs, incomplete and poorly executed plot, and just not a lot of story making sense.

207,alpi_wan_kenobi,More than an usual science fiction,10,12 May 2006,"Andrei Tarkovsky had told that Solyaris was the least favorite film of me. But in this movie he could pass the border of a science fiction. He would told the souls of human beings never been lost. And Hari's mood and thoughts would be successfully told. Tarkovsky told a lot of things about the Solaris planet, life, death but never gave in front of us. In fact, he chose to ask. I think the relationships between two characters would be told nicely. Especially, Kris' mother and Hari are professionally draw ed.I think when you watch this movie first, you may have a lot of question marks in your brain but naturally this is the trademark of Tarkovsky.

209,555piero,Powerful and claustrophobic,10,3 December 2001,"This is a fine, fine film.  Beautiful camera work and stark acting are the hallmarks of Russian cinema though nowhere is this formula used to such effect as it is here.  Lingering, haunting scenes evoke powerfully the stuff of memories, contrasting with sudden and frightening shots of the surreal events that occur onboard the space station. It certainly isn't an easy film to watch: you'll need persistence to understand what is happening and something lighter afterwards to cut through the claustrophobic atmosphere that is left at the ending.  Rarely is a film so affecting and so rewarding and the current fashion for movies with a 'twist' at the end finds a prototype here in what must be one of the most moving examples of an unexpected conclusion in cinema history.",Solaris
210,honuman32,Powerful exploration into the nature of consciousness....long and poetic,10,26 September 2008,"This movie was not made with the contemporary attention span in mind. Tarkovsky seemed hell bent on staying true to a vision of exploring ideas of human relationships and consciousness. To communicate deeper multi-layered philosophies, Tarkovsky takes his time setting a pace that is as slow and deliberate as is the payoff for sticking with this film to the end. The ideas Tarkovsky is working with would seem to be better suited to a book format (and amazingly enough, in my opinion, the movie is better than the book the film is based on) yet he uses the medium of film successfully. I was profoundly affected after watching it for the first time and it has been a film I've gone back to regularly over the years. This is by no means a movie to sit down and expect to be entertained. If you don't engage it and consider what is being presented you will most likely not enjoy the poetic and philosophical elements that elevate this film to high art.

212,jaegar12345,Over focus not focus,9,19 November 2021,"Overfocus leaves blind spots, that's where the issues with 'Solaris' arise. Tarkovsky isn't about specifics; he provokes and knows precisely how to do so, he created an artifice around him where his films aren't about any one thing ('Solaris' is closest to being an exception), but to each individual they are. His movies end up being about what the audience members think he thinks. This is especially clear with 'Solaris', a film where trauma is pulled from normal people's pasts to confront, like audiences forced to project to ""understand"" Tarkovsky. The issue I allude to is his desperate need to be thought provoking, often distracting from details and fluid storytelling.In saying that 'Solaris' tells a hugely detailed story of a Tarkovsky everyman dealing with trauma at different points of his life - different stages represented by each character. We all struggle, things like trauma and existentialism can be impossible to overcome; ignorance is bliss, it's best to stick to the lakes you believe you know, rather than the vast erratic ocean you don't.

He still managed to keep me fascinated despite the lengthy and slowly paced trail to reach his conclusion of the human psyche.I would say i definitely felt emotion as the movie was supposed to lead me, so i would suggest Tarkovsky was successful in his endeavours despite the lack of jaw dropping awe i have felt with those very few films i would fit into the category of ""masterpiece"".And once again, it is much closer to ""masterpiece"" that 2001 in my book",Solaris

Unfortunately many directors in the 1970s were still experimenting and just didn't have their techniques perfected - with their films having long slow scenes which go nowhere.  If people have only seen crap movies then this might be a breath of fresh air, but sadly there are too many good movies to watch to put up with this snooze-a-thon.  Yes, I fell asleep too and bitterly resented my time wasted when I saw it at the local Film Society.Interestingly, the local student radio station allowed listeners to vote for a movie to watch on DVD at the local large-screen cinema and bewilderingly this turkey won.

This movie and 2001: A Space Odissey are the best sci-fi movies ever.First of all it is a Soviet movie. So is more for an art movie than an American blockbuster. The pace is slow, the dialogues are like daydreams. But even with this characteristics, it is the most palatable Tarkovsky movie. If you want to get into Tarkovsky cinematography start with this one.It is important remember the book (Solaris - Stanislaw Lem), which originates this movie. Both are different in some aspects. The book is more focused in the science of the Solaristic while the movie is more human focused. This difference is not a problem, actually is the strongest quality of the movie. The director shows us what really matter in any good science fiction, the human beings. The movie is not based on visual effects. Only with a perfect setting and dialogues the director show us the limits of our nature. The philosophical thoughts about what is a human being and the discussions about the limits of science can drive us to reflections about what is really important in our life.We want to understand the cosmos but we can't even understand ourselves.",Solaris

A warning to the impatient public, used to Bruce Willis:  this movie is not about aliens that will eat human brains.  Don't expect action.  This is purely a philosophical, slow-paced thoughtful approach to the essence of a human being.  The best things about this movie are subtle and require careful watching.  It helps a great deal if you understand Russian very well, because English subtitles don't do justice to the connotations of the script.  This movie is largely built on the Iceberg Principle.  Look beneath the surface.I would also recommend watching ""Stalker"", ""Mirror"", ""Thirty three"", and ""Kin-dza-dza"".  They all have overtones of the soviet social analysis/criticism.",Solaris

Tarkovsky deals with the big questions in life in an ambitious but extremely satisfying way.,10,21 September 2002,"Some people consider this film to be 'too slow' or 'very boring', and therefore write the whole thing off as a bad film. If this happened to you, I really think you should give it another try when you're 'in the right mood'. Never have I seen a film deal with the big questions of love and life in the way that ""Solaris"" does. Tarkovsky doesn't give you the answers, but I found myself crying watching some of the most memorable scenes in the film. The symbolism and depth is unbelievable. This film is capable of changing or at least strengthening your views on the human race and your own life. I give it 10/10 and place it on top of my list of all time favourite films!",Solaris

I personally prefer movie. Tarkovsky is going beyond the limits described by Lem. It is not only the problem of Solaris planet and the relationship between main heroes. Tarkovsky reminds everybody that the origin of our problem is us. And all kind of the most important life keys you can find inside yourselves. The great Swedish director Ingemar Bergman said, that Tarkovsky is in the ""room"" where I just started to knock. You should see this movie if you want to know what is real you and what you really want. The movie is not the answer, but it is the step to your new understanding of your life.",Solaris

226,trangolin,Valuable reference,7,8 March 2014,"As with Kubrick's ""2001"", Solaris is a valuable reference to all the rest, tens and hundreds of imitations, not only in the sci-fi space, but in the general cultural space. While Lem's book is superb and predates Tarkovky's movie by more then a decade, the 1972 Solaris is a bit long for watching and not as satisfying after reading the book. the truth is Lem was a genius. Tarkovsky is a poet of the cinema, ready to take on the challenge of putting on screen major philosophical questions about humanity, its options and its destiny as viewed by Lem. I found the acting and the dialog a bit lacking in value, as if they were either trying to follow the script as ordered by the director or a bit too rigid. Russian language does not help either and I supposed the subtitles either. Donatas Banionis is lacking a wider range of expressions to make this role memorable, reminds me of the more recent failures like Johnny Depp. Natalya Bondarchuck is barely age of consent and a total rookie, except being the daughter of the big shot of Soviet cinema that Tarkovsky probably needed to get the project off the ground. This was 10 years before he decided to stay in Italy and defect from the KGB state of Andropov and nowadays Putin.all in all a memorable piece - a must see before you go the movies again or watch any other imitation.",Solaris
227,tjlange1,So why was this remade?,8,12 September 2005,"I would have to rate this as one of the best science fiction movies that I have seen. After sitting through the awful Solaris (2002), I wasn't sure what to expect from this picture. But after the first scene of this movie, I knew that this was going to be a completely different experience. This is definitely a movie where you want to block out 3 hours without distraction and just soak it in. I loved the deliberate pacing and the moods conveyed by scenes throughout the movie. This is without a doubt not your modern fx bonanza that uses special effects as a crutch to prop up a thin story. This movie has depth and the lack of effects and over the top aliens is what makes this picture special. A must see.",Solaris
228,fivelements,"A meditation on consciousness, humanity and our relationships with mother earth",10,2 February 2015,"So this isn't the science fiction movie to watch aliens and humans blowing the snot out of each other with whiz bang special effects. This movie, to me, has always been a high art film and one that requires you to approach it that way. If you like philosophy and are interested in metaphysics then (hopefully) you'll enjoy it. Last thing I'll say about this as a caveat, I'd been told that Tarkovsky made this film as a response to Kubrick's 2001 because he felt Kubrick was too vague in his vision and used special effects and imagery to impress viewers rather than use good storytelling.I think this movie has so many depths to it that its almost required to watch it several times. The parts of the movie that most people will either find too long or boring, IMO are there for specific reasons and have more resonance if you consider them seriously. For example, in the beginning, Kris Kelvin the cosmonaut is at his farm home in nature. We see extensive shots of a stream, plants, trees, etc. While you could make an easy judgment about the point of these shots as something Tarkovsky is doing to impart the importance of nature, he seems to want to get the audience to get past making quick points and move into a more contemplative place. What I get from these opening scenes is something much more once the movie ended. In this opening, Tarkovsky I think is trying to immerse the audience in the same natural environment as his protagonist. The emphasis on natural rhythms and life on the planet in general is important to soak in when you see how the main character ends up; both in his mind with memories of earth life but also the ramifications on the human psyche when not immediately connected to the earth. Another example of a scene that people find unrelentingly dull and unnecessary is the drive from the farm to the space flight center that will take Kris into space. It's a long drive with scenes of nature giving way to the cement and buildings of city life. I think it's an important transition sequence not just so the viewer can consider the idea that Kris is leaving nature and slowly being absorbed by human made environments which culminates to the space station and then even further, the consciousness of a higher intelligence of the planet Solaris, but the drive sequence shows how we are moving collectively there by paving over and controlling nature. Devaluing it and dismissing any spiritual/psychological value it has for us. This also continues Tarkovsky's immersion process for the audience to go from all nature to more human made environments. It seems to me that he wants us to feel the contrast more fully than a simple metaphorical set of images and in some ways is a very thoughtful F-U to one of Kubrick's most famous transitions of the bone turned to spacecraft. Kubrick's is a quick and dramatic transition. Tarkovsky's languid and less obvious transition refuses to give the viewer any easy way to process it. It makes it a lot more rewarding IMO but I still am a 2001 fan. The love story, such as it is, is one that is both emotional and very metaphysical is one of the most unusual in film history and presented as an honest and real relationship which makes it a powerful one to process. I never saw the remake but the advertisements made it seem like the love story was the centerpiece and to me, it's just a vehicle to pull Kelvin into Solaris' consciousness/intelligence reality. By the time the ending of the movie comes, the questions about the other scientists and Kris's love life get superseded by questions involving what happens when humanity comes into contact with higher intelligence that doesn't come in a form we recognize or in a way we understand. The implications of leaving life on earth to explore the universe may lead us to discover the existence of realities of consciousness that don't fall into established ideas and paradigms we're comfortable with or understand. Solaris offers an example of this possibility and it's very compelling.",Solaris
229,smtimagine,An introspective sci-fi movie,8,19 August 2016,"Solaris's main focus, in my opinion, is on what makes humans human. What defines a person? Is it memories? Is it the body? Is it emotions? How would you react if you met an entity indistinguishable from a person in almost every aspect? These and other interrogatives are examined on the movie, which asks also some philosophical questions. For example: what is our purpose being alive? This is the first Tarkovsky's movie I have watched. Many frames of the movie look like paintings. How not to mention the first opening minutes. Vibrant colors characterize nature on earth, while cold colors are reserved for the space station. It needs to be noted that instead of the customary dark, white light enters from the windows, because of Solaris ocean, like the name implies. Tarkovsky doesn't show us a optimistic vision of the future. We have a rundown space station, with only three people on it, on the verge of madness. There seems to be no way to make contact with the ocean of Solaris and throughout the whole movie there's a strong atmosphere of in;communicability. It is a very introspective movie, despite being set in space most of the time. A moment of dramatic tension is when the ""guest"" (as they decided to call them) becomes aware of the uniqueness of her existence. Especially as this realization comes together with a decreasing difference with respect to any human being. By the time the movie is close to the end, she's indistinguishable from one. So the question is.. is she a ""real"" person? What defines a person? How does she feel about her condition? What about her feelings or thoughts? Are those really hers? The movie can be a little hard to watch as some scenes are a little too drawn out but on closer examination they set the necessary pauses to ponder about the points the movie is trying to make. It also serves to set a contrast between scenes similar in purpose: for example we have a man driving through the highway for five minutes (almost) while the trip to the space station is much faster. Notable also the use of some black and white scenes in contrast to color ones, to set apart the past, dreams, memories.. although there are some changes and I will probably need to watch the movie again to be sure. The conclusion some characters reach is the necessity of looking inward and the impossibility to understand that which is greater than us. It is in this setting our protagonist experiences deep conflict and has to make a final choice.",Solaris

Related by ancestry to Bladerunner, premise of which:  women are aliens.  Solaris, however, stands to Bladerunner as Bach cantatas to Salvation Army hymns:  a profound meditation on what it might mean to be a man.  Bladerunner takes the women-as-alien premise and makes a romance; Solaris uses it as a wedge to open up more interesting things:  consciousness, desire, endurance, fidelity -- y'know, love:  man and wife, father and son, boy and dog, comrade and comrade. what maybe makes the whole business worthwhile....Transcendantly humane.Gotta be careful, because two cuts exist. One is a totally  butchered 90-minute thing with scrambled reels, partly dubbed, occasional subtitles -- a senseless botch, somebody's idea about a low-grade cheapo sci-fi movie in 1973.

Soon his dead girlfriend appears on the station, and he starts to question his own sanity and the awesome, puzzling nature of Solaris. Honestly this science-fiction film is like no other.

I guess that it is in that conflict that Tarkovsky scores because I found the journey through this story emotional, ( who knows maybe my ancestors were Russian?)All in all as a fan of the book i expected this to be a let down but was really shocked to almost find yet another translation.So even though this film is in my personal top twenty I really do not know if I can recommend it to others, possibly because one of its issues is that Humanity wants mirrors not aliens, but if you want an alien experience then I can recommend this.",Solaris

This movie parallels 2001 A Space Odyssey in the search for meaning. While the plot takes a while to unfold, it grabs you and holds you for the duration. A Must See for any movie fan.

It is immaculately crafted, but that may be its principle problem: it feels labored, strenuous, and overbearing in its near-3-hour running time, so much so that it seems to lack genuine force or momentum. While certain sequences certainly are fascinating, and the unique production design (bringing to mind A Clockwork Orange, and other early-70s avant-garde pieces) is at times startling, the entire film feels bogged down in its sci-fi pretensions, rather than being driven by them. Tarkovsky really, really loved exploring the realism vs. fantasy aspect in this outing, and his curiosities sometimes gets the better of him: some of the long takes are 8 or 9 minutes long! That being said, Solaris' uniqueness  and limitless imagination demands that you at least give it a chance; it also boasts one of the most unforgettable closing shots in film history.

The movie begins with Kelvin, a psychologist, traveling to a space station on some planet.  He views a tape of a previous scientist that has died.  This scientist, Gibaryan, warns him about what has happened to him, and emphasized that what he saw was not ""madness"".  While Gibaryan is talking, a young girl walks behind him.  The film ends, and Kelvin is bewildered.  Soon, Kelvin awakens and finds a woman in his room.  She turns out to be his deceased wife Hari.  Was Kelvin's wife imagined or an alien? If she was brought to life by his imagination, did this occur because of the solitude of deep space, an alien force from the ""Ocean"", or some other evil force?  When Hari initially appears, Kelvin tries to eliminate her (thinking she was his imagination or an alien) by shooting her off in a rocket.  Of course, she reappears unscathed.  The other scientists (Snouth and Sartorius) warn Kelvin that they themselves have also had ""guests"", and that things would inevitably ""end badly"".  Interestingly, Hari is a real entity, and communicates with the other scientists as well. The movie is really an example of psychic torment; even the space station is dilapidated and strewn with equipment, etc. and the scientists wander aimlessly, having to deal with their thoughts.

For example Dr. Snaut says ""you love some thing only if you can loose it"". This statement is slightly confusing. To think about it one may loose any thing and every thing that one has inclusive of oneself. Is there any thing that we will not ever loose so that we can consider hating it? Is this the context to understand? Or is the context like in - one being very nice to friends because you know you may loose him or her but taking a spouse for granted because there is certain level of tolerance in the relationship and may be less volatile.

Despite I'd like to comment on some other viewers comments with humble purpose to help those who couldn't make it through the movie...Well.. It is a hard task... First thing is the car ride, which seems to be a break point for most of people. It is NOT a boring scene, with nothing in it. In some sense it is not a scene at all. It is not meant to explain something or to tell you something or anything else like that. This is what one has to keep in mind watching it. Then what it is? Well let's get back to what you've already seen before the car drive... an intro, which prepares you that you gonna have questions with no direct answers given... While modern cinematograph drives your mind with an average of one-two points to ponder, i.e. who is bad? who is good? who has killed? etc. in the beginning of the movie, Tarkovsky gives you a whole situation to think about. Several people-what are the connection between them? what happened in the past? what's gonna happen in the future? The characters are deep and very ambiguios ... just like real people are. You feel like someone who tries to understand the lifelines of complete strangers, who are still close to you or to somebody you know - because this characters are REAL people... Well, where is ENTERTAINMENT here? Why would this be interesting for you??Where is Si-Fi here??? The answer is obvious: In an intro you need to get into movie and became Chris Kelvin - it is not an ENTERTAINMENT although...:) If you ever thought about your own life here you have a chance to think about somebody's life like your own... If you managed to do that you have a ticket to the rest of the movie, which is gonna take you into a very unusual and weird situation- into a REAL ALL CAPITAL LETTERS SI-FI!!!  Now, what the hell is the car ride has to do with ALL THAT??? The answer is now close... just wait:)   By now you dear viewer performed (hopefully) a very hard thing during 45 min - you've at least partially, became somebody else! But before moving you into intense mind action of the rest of the movie Tarkovsky gives you some time to prepare your new personality by HYPNOTIZING you in a car - it is a HYPNOSIS on the screen!!!-did you see anything like that anywhere else???:)- watch it and let your thoughts be open and slowly moving around... use this 8 min in a car!!! It is a very short time!!! Because eventually this is going to be switched suddenly to a green grass and to you-not sitting on the couch in your room, but being in movie... thinking.. feeling... your last minutes on Earth before going to the weird somewhere... the palce where everything which is called YOU, your whole personality will be blown by the circumstances which you never met before. And YOU are the one who is going to deal with that for more then two hours! If you like to be somewhere in your dreams, where you actually have no chance to be in your whole life - this is your CHANCE to travel there! This is your movie!Well, after watching it over fifty times, I can say that there is a lot more in it. And it is quite impossible to say all the things which I could think about this movie...Just to encourage you- I also like movies with Shwarzeneger:):), it is OK if you too. It doesn't mean you are not able to experience that ultimate pleasure being on Solaris, experiencing all this events... looks and sounds. It is just a very different thing from a usual Hollywood movie, because it is NOT a SHOW!

This is the second movie of Tarkovsky I've seen, and I think his films are slow intentionally, to leave time for you to think throughout the movie. This is not an action movie, people... What I love about Tarkovsky's movies is that while they carry an idea, you still have a lot to think about besides that idea. I am thinking about the idea of darkness/light: driving down the long tunnel with occasional short breakouts of daylight and darkness/daylight while on the Solaris.

252,filipecarapeto,Watch at least once but...,5,13 February 2021,"I'm not a big fan of comparing two movies to each other but since even Tarkovsky said that this movie was, in a way, an attempt to improve 2001 Space Odyssey, I have to address that comparison.The two movies might share some similarities but while 2001 Space Odyssey is one of the genre's best movies, and one of my favorites ever, Solyaris is a couple of notches below.I'm not going to comment on the outdated effects, which were never an issue for me with 2001 Space Odyssey, or the pace but the acting and plot really bored me to death.The plot for me, even considering this is sci-fi, bordered on non-sensical.As for the characters, I don't know how people in 70's Russia behaved but they seem too melodramatic and, while the acting is not bad, they act in ways that don't seem natural to me.Also the music was mostly old-fashioned (usually baroque) which didn't help with the sci-fi atmosphere.Overall, even taking into consideration the time when they were made, Space Odyssey always looks to me as a step forward while Solyaris seems not like a step back but like meh.",Solaris
253,proudest_monkey,for the masochist in you - slow misery that is well worth it,8,16 June 2010,"This film is slow like molasses in winter, but the pace forces you to set aside your common expectations and surrender to the meditative style of Tarkovsky's storytelling.It took me a minor inner struggle (like consciously slowing your breathing) but was worth it in the end.Beautifully, desperately sad. The contrast of long silence and brief violent motion is simple and effective.Don't know what it's like in English - might be worse.I don't believe that to enjoy this movie you have to do extensive research into the director's personal history or motives, or the underlying philosophy and psychology principles illustrated, or the political situation in Russia when it was made. The film is accessible on a purely visceral level, regardless of the intellectual stimuli it may offer.On a personal note, it made me miss Russia something fierce.",Solaris

This movie makes you think about it for about 3 days after you watch. Makes you wonder how can a movie be such a wonderful. This review contains a lot of compliment first of all.After i watch this movie i told myself 'Wake up!'.Andrei Tarkovsky was a human who had used his brain for good things. Good things like this movie. He was so imaginary and at the same time realistic. Actors and actresses were played like so realistic. Not fancy gestures, only realistic.This movie touched me so deeply. I couldn't come to myself for about 3 days after this materpiece. And i can tell this for sure, this movie teach me how to distinguish movies that good or bad.I can surely recommend this masterpiece to you. But i can not assure you to understand this deep and extraordinary movie.",Solaris
255,HubertusDerksen,Bach 's music lift's also Tarkovsky's Solayris,8,15 September 2005,"In this Russian's art-house quality-product science-fiction, the genius of Tarkovski uses the music by Bach in an impressive way. The movie is a slow, tragically poetic story of people who are (forced) to life on a strange planet, which is as enormous organism can plot, detect and materialize the subconsciousness of people. Is it unfair to say that this movie is in a way a symbolic portrait of the Soviet-Union of the seventies of the Twentieth Century? A super state, in which a complete inert society has to cope with the remnants of the long term effects of Stalinism, and the problems of organizing an untrue country and the continuing of an society in which freedom of thoughts is defined as a close and permanent danger to the prosperity of the state. Most impressive is the music from the Orgelbüchlein (Ich ruf' zu dir, Herr Jesu Christ from Chorale Preludes I (Das Orgelbüchlein, BWV 639) by Bach used in Solaris. The sober and almost as gently as possible performed Koralvorspiel is in minor and that gives this movie it's utmost apotheoses. I a way I want to think that this music is a prayer by Tarkovski to get strength to hold on in this schizophrenic USSR.",Solaris

258,john-1909,Not exactly science fiction - watch it again.,8,22 February 2005,"As a piece of Soviet cinema, Solyaris tells us about the culture from which it came - and so that is very interesting to contemplate, even despite our frustrated expectation of the 'science fiction' genre to provide visual effects or to fully recreate the world as it is with one that might be. But Solaris' great achievement is its internal representations, which are stirred by poetic imagery, long panning scenes, & surprising interchanges between characters.When the film does try to evoke a portrait of ""future world"" by the use of a long driving sequence that takes Burton from his country visit with the Kelvins to the ultra-modern city, we are particularly disappointed (or amused) to note what paucity of reference we are given to ""flesh out"" the contemporary situation. We see, for example, that in the future people do not steer their own cars. On the other hand cars must be scarce, because there's not much traffic around & it's apparent that the same decades-old (?) models are still on the road in lieu of newer ones. Asian language characters appearing on road markers along the highway may surprise us, but compared to, say, Ridley Scott's new Asian Los Angeles, it is a subtle devise indeed. The technological future, after all, must serve as a contrast to Kris Kelvin's nostalgia that will come to haunt him in space, as well as to the timeless, natural world of the simple country dacha, children at play, horses, rain. So the absence of a convincing science fiction ""future world"" is troubling to the thematic proposition of this otherwise almost perfect film.As to the slowness, I imagine it would not be in the heart of its contemporary Soviet audience to complain about a slow, prolonged cinema experience if what awaited upon leaving the movie house were more of the same drudgery & hopelessness that was life and work behind the ""iron curtain"". But, I suspect the director was not merely wishing to opiate the audience. Just as a billows fills with air as you pull at its handles, so do these moments, many of them, fill out & expand even as they are suspended almost beyond reason. I would say that if you watched Solyaris once & found it boring, that you only need to watch it again. Then, if you still found it boring, watch it two more times. Still bored, review it four times again. Eventually, repeating this doubling until you do nothing else, you, too, will find just what it is that makes Solyaris a singular piece of film-making.",Solaris
259,imdb-6205,"Disappointing, poorly cut and very very slow",2,12 April 2005,"What a let-down this film was. I can appreciate the atmosphere the director was trying to achieve, but frankly he failed. The film is ludicrously slow moving, interspersed with long, excruciating abstract scenes such as ten minutes of Tokyo traffic with howling, mechanical noises that seemed irrelevant to the film. The acting is stilted, overwrought, humourless and unemotional. The film is scruffy and poorly cut, fluctuating between colour and b/w apparently at random. Special effects, where attempted, were dire. Similar in ambition to Kubrick's 2001, this lacked the artistic beauty, quality of sound and atmosphere and the plot, while interesting, unfolded so painfully slowly it gave me a headache.I'm not going to give away the ending -- because I'm sad to say that after two hours I walked out, a very rare thing. Don't waste your time with this film.",Solaris
260,michaelrichtol,Tarkovsky's masterpiece,10,2 March 2014,"This is one of the top five best movies I have ever seen. I don't think its on the AFI 100 list, which is completely criminal. Even though the special effects are obviously dated, it in no way detracts from the overall aesthetic & emotional beauty of Tarkovsky's brilliant masterpiece.The storyline and the gut-wrenching emotion of this movie are deeply moving. You don't have to be a science-fiction fan to glean the universal message that this movie so brilliantly conveys.After seeing this, I watched Tarkovsky's other films and was disappointed. They weren't bad movies, but they did not compare to Solaris. Maybe that is an unfair comparison, since there simply is no movie in the history of cinema that is like Solaris.",Solaris
261,juergent,One of the best 'realistic' films ever,10,5 June 2005,"I've read the book. I've seen this movie so many times and it is still one of the most fascinating movies ever shot on this planet. This has to do with my preference to watch movies that are very close to reality. No noise in space like in the Star Wars movies. No unnatural cuts that tries to 'speed up' this film. Of course, this takes patience and some of the comments I've read about this movie are mentioning how 'slow' this movie is. Well, reality is not exactly fast moving. Just going from A to B takes time. So, the sequence showing the world outside a car windshield is just right. And the nature scenes are awesome and makes you hungry to see more of nature's wonders. The music is to die for, the classical opening from Bach opens your mind to a different world. The story is complex and you need to pay attention. I bought recently the original Russian version with subtitles to get a better feeling how the language sounds in its original. It is all fantastic good. The German translation I like best, maybe because that is my mother language. In my opinion, the only other film that seems a little ahead of this movie is 2001: A Space Odyssee. But this is another story. Juergen",Solaris
262,carlrmcq,Psychologist is sent to space station to determine if the mission over Solaris will continue,6,15 June 2005,"This film is so typically Russian. It is incredibly slow paced and frankly, when seen thirty years after its creation I found that I felt I was in the middle of a narrative for which I knew no back story. The film is clearly laden with symbolism pitting nature against technology as well as dozens of other vague allusions to immortality, loss, grief, love and desire.All of this is presented, however, in a cloudy, non-literal way. As much is unsaid and murkily implied in the film as is said. Details are either not specified or missing completely and much is totally not explained at all.I left the theatre and made a list of over twenty questions the film never even attempted to answer. Frankly, it was a little frustrating.Kelvin, the main character, for example, just seems to take it all sweatily in stride when encounters his wife who has been dead for ten years and falls in love with her, or the her this duplicate has become. We never actually see the other two scientists ""Guests"" for any more than a passing shot which is unfortunate. Other details are completely not provided either, such as to exactly why the third remaining scientist has killed himself.Overall, the film is very ""Fellini"" in its oddness and if you are looking for clear-cut answers, watch another film. In an era of fast-paced action films, this one stands out for its slow approach and leaden pacing. It is watchable though and I am glad I saw it in counterpoint to the remake of a few years ago, which was much more Hollywood. The interesting thing is, when seen together, they complete the story much more perfectly than either do individually. It made me want to read the 1961 book upon which the movie is based.",Solaris
263,ifly-94041,hmm hate this,1,12 May 2015,"I don't know I don't like it I feel like something missingUnhappy with Kubrick's 2001, celebrated Russian director Andrei Tarkovsky concocted his own sci-fi think piece, Solyaris. Involving an alien intelligence that is able to read minds and project (physically?) the thoughts of those who are visiting the planet on which it resides, Solyaris is deep, long (and I mean long), and devilishly confusing (and more reminiscent of THX 1138 than 2001). Primarily seen through the eyes of one scientist who finds his long- deceased wife suddenly alive on Solaryis's planet, if one Kubrick work comes to mind it's actually The Shining. (In later years, the appallingly bad Sphere is an obvious take-off on this film, only the alien is underwater instead of in space.) Occasionally brilliant, Solyaris speaks to the depth of meaning in men's souls. Some of its visuals are incredible, though many are dull, and at nearly three hours in length, there's too much fodder to make the movie even approaching of a masterpiece (Tarkovsky has stated this is his least favorite film, too). But most to the point: Did I understand it? No. Is it nonetheless a must-see of any sci-fi obsessive? Absolutely. Never mind the subtitles.",Solaris
264,moosenb,One of the top Science-Fiction films of all,10,6 September 2005,"I feel badly for those that were bored by this film. Society has become too interested in the quick fix, blow-it-up films like The Transporter 2 and Sahara. While there is a place for mindless entertainment, there is also a place for the thinking-man's film as well. Solayris clearly fits the bill.Yes, it is slow. Yes, the car scene is tedious. So what? The film hits home on an emotional level. That won't happen with The Transporter or Sahara, will it? It forces you to ask questions about the very make-up of human life.Solayris is, simply put, one of the top Science-Fiction films of all time.

265,delacroix2827,Solyaris,10,7 March 2006,"Tarkovsky's Solaris has been a profound and inspirational film for me and I have really appreciated reading the novel as well as watching the Criterion edition of the film. I specially appreciate the use of Bach's organ Choral prelude throughout the film, particularly during a scene where Kelvin and Hari (Rheya) are reminiscing. The picture and sound quality of the Criterion edition are remarkable and make the film a treat to watch. Donatis Banionis' and and Natalya Bondarchuk's performances were exceptional and this film has left lasting impressions on my mind. Bergman's 'Persona' and Kurasawa's 'Dreams' inspired me similarly and I look forward to watching Tarkovsky's 'Andrei Rublev'.",Solaris
266,l_deaking-36814,"It's an experience, but not a piece of entertainment",7,24 August 2017,"Before you watch Solaris, make sure you know what you're getting yourself into. I did not find this film particularly entertaining. It wasn't fun to watch. It's more like a moving painting than a normal science-fiction film. Don't expect to be excited and dazzled by great special effects. Don't expect to be sitting on the edge of your seat at any point during this film. If you're looking for a bit of joyful escapism, you'll definitely do well to give this a miss. Forget about Star Wars.Frankly, there are long stretches of this film that are rather boring. I also found much of the acting to be unimpressive. The main character seems to have exactly the same facial expression throughout. It is very hard to actually engage with the characters. I realised towards the end that I simply didn't care about how things were going to turn out for them. I was utterly indifferent to their fate.Despite these drawbacks, there is something strangely captivating and hypnotic about Solaris. It deals with some very interesting philosophical themes such as the nature of love, consciousness, personal identity, and memory. The meaning of life itself is explored. Some of the cinematography is stunning. If you're into that kind of thing, I think this film certainly would benefit from repeated viewings. It stayed in my mind for a long time afterwards, which is always a sign of a good film.This is obviously an example of a film that many people think they 'ought' to watch and enjoy. Just put all of that baggage out of your mind and give it a go. Treat it like an exercise in meditation and contemplation. It will slow you down and put you in a different frame of mind. Don't beat yourself up if you just find it dull. We all have different tastes!",Solaris

268,mu-kau,The magic of not knowing where we're going....,10,22 March 2006,"Like the majority of reviewers here, I rate this film as one of the most profound viewing experiences I can remember. While the IMDb guidelines recommend avoiding reference to specific reviews of Solaris within this section, I strongly believe that there is much to be learnt about this movie by evaluating those reviews as a whole.This is clearly either a love or a hate movie. Those who love it describe in detail its effect on them, the feelings it evokes, its significance and the depth of its philosophical enquiry. Those who hate it largely describe it as too slow-paced; boring.What matters to me about this film which I first watched as mesmerised 15 year old is that it is almost entirely the antithesis of Classical Hollywood cinema. It came from behind the Iron Curtain (that dark place whose strange and hidden 'otherness' has, like the plot of any modern movie, now also been laid wide open by capitalist 'democracy'). Its actors were unknown - more like real people than the celebrities the West populates its movies with. Its pace was slow, mesmeric, hypnotic and atmospheric. It was completely free of the kind of 'good triumphs over evil' motif that riddles Hollywood film-making, where 'good' is white-ness, wealth, youth, Westernness and so on.The pleasure of Solaris was that I didn't know what I was watching. I didn't know who I was watching. I didn't know the culture it reflected and - most importantly - I didn't know what was going to happen. Perhaps its only in re-watching the 1971 Solaris that it becomes apparent to me that somewhere along the way we have been stripped of the right to not know; robbed of the true narrative thrill of being led into the dark, magical forest of the unknown.",Solaris
