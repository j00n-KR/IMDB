0,MartinHafer,"Haunting and clever...but not exactly ""sci-fi""",9,3 January 2009,"This is a very well written film that is fascinating throughout, but I can't understand IMDb listing it as sci-fi--though there are very strong fantasy elements. What I liked best about the film is that it was made with an apparently minuscule budget and most of it took place in a single room (like TWELVE ANGRY MEN)--showing you don't need explosions, boobs or action to have an excellent film.THE MAN FROM EARTH begins with a professor packing up to leave. With little notice, he's decided to drop everything and leave--and he's told no one where he's headed. His colleagues are baffled--he is a good friend and yet none of this makes sense. Not only is his exit a surprise, but he's leaving a good job and they see no reason for this. Then, on a lark, he tells them that he's actually a 15000 year-old immortal--that he ALWAYS disappears every 10 years--otherwise people would wonder why he never seems to age.While this is an exciting premise, the film is highly philosophical in nature with very strong religious overtones. In fact, these religious elements are bound to offend many people. My advice is just to remember that it's all a story--it's not true and it's just a clever way to explain various religious dogmas. You can still be a good religious person and see this film! The film gets super-high marks for writing--with a story that grabs your attention and won't let go. It also gets very high marks as well for a great ensemble cast. While some of the character actors are quite familiar, it's likely you don't know any of their names. The film has no ""big name"" actors and actually benefited from this--heightening the sense of realism. Plus, the cast did such a great job, I can't imagine others doing better.The only reservation I have is that I can't imagine super hyperactive or many teenagers enjoying this film--you really need to sit still and pay attention and be willing to accept a film that is very ""talky"" and subdued. For these folks, try looking elsewhere.",The Man from Earth
1,SnoopyStyle,My Dinner with Harry,6,9 September 2018,"Professor John Oldman has invited several colleagues in varying disciplines. He's leaving and suggests that he's some 14,000 years old. He tells them that he picks up and leaves every ten years or so just as people get suspicious of him not aging. The colleagues argue from their differing expertise. They dismiss it. They interrogate John. They start to believe. It turns religious. Then he claims that it's all a hoax.This feels like a sci-fi writing exercise all be it a very good assignment. I simply don't understand John's motivation in gathering this group. In fact, they ask him and he says he doesn't know. It seems like a cry for help which would only work if he commits suicide after telling them his whole story. As it stands, I rather have him do a My Dinner with Andre... My Dinner with Harry. I'm uncertain about the religious turn. It feels manufactured. The most intriguing route for the character is for him to be a nobody. He's a loner living a nomadic existence. Overall, I really appreciate the idea to dig into the long-lived man concept. I would just do it differently.",The Man from Earth
2,gavin6942,A Glorious Story Committed to Camera,8,7 January 2013,"An impromptu goodbye party for Professor John Oldman (David Lee Smith) becomes a mysterious interrogation after the retiring scholar reveals to his colleagues he has a longer and stranger past than they can imagine.First of all, thank you for casting Tony Todd. Allegedly he was the first person cast, and I am glad he was. While he may be best known for horror films and especially ""Candyman"", this is a man who is a trained actor and knows his craft -- let him do it. Here, he does it.This is very much a film with two great strengths. We have a powerful set of actors, with Smith leading the way. Cult icons William Katt and Richard Riehle are here. ""Star Trek: Enterprise"" fans will surely recognize John Billingsley. And even more so, an incredible dialogue-rich script from Jerome Bixby that covers a range of history, science, geography, art and religion. The very concept is brilliant, and the execution is flawless. That Bixby is not better known, despite his massive influence on the genre, is a real shame.This would make a great stage play (which is how it first appeared, I believe) or perhaps an even better radio drama -- it comes across as sort of pointless as a film. Not to say it is a bad film -- it is excellent -- but without there being any action or more than one setting, it seems almost silly to have a visual aspect at all.",The Man from Earth
3,paul_haakonsen,This movie is definitely one not to miss out on...,8,8 September 2014,"""The Man from Earth"" really surprised me, and this is the kind of movie that will stick with you for a long, long time once you have watched it.The story is about John Oldman (played by David Lee Smith) who is about to leave town and saying good bye to his friends, when he is coaxed into unveiling a very surprising and somewhat disturbing story about his life to his friends.Don't expect much to actually happen physically in this movie. Let me be straight with you, all that happens in this movie is basically a group of people sitting in a living room and talk. Yeah, that is literally all that is going on. But it is done with such finesse and skill that the movie turned out to be interesting and compelling. Director Richard Schenkman really managed to pull this movie off so nicely on many levels.""The Man from Earth"" is the type of movie that gives the audience something to think about, and all throughout the entire movie you are sort of kept in the dark, but constantly being fed bits and pieces of information, letting the audience themselves make up whether or not what is being told is a tale or actual fact.The cast was great, and they had managed to put together a good ensemble of acting talent for this particular movie. And everyone delivered nicely, especially given the fact that everyone was basically just sitting around listening to a story being told and questioning the storyteller.I stumbled upon ""The Man from Earth"" by sheer luck, and it turned out to be one of the more memorable movie experiences I have had in a long, long time.""The Man from Earth"" scores a solid 8 out of 10 stars from me without a doubt. This Sci-Fi drama is guaranteed to set your mind into motion.",The Man from Earth
4,LeonLouisRicci,Overrated and Dull Religious Rap,1,11 January 2013,"This is the kind of movie that gives thoughtful skepticism about Deity and Religion a bad rap. The rap here is nothing new or even refreshing. It is a rather ""old"" and tired rumination about Religious faith and doctored Holy documents.This one never elevates itself above sophomoric and the players seem to struggle and it all seems stilted and ready to come to a halt but unfortunately it musters enough forced energy to keep going. The philosophy is not thought-provoking and there is not one ah-ha moment. The other problem besides the script is the total lack of charisma that is needed for the main character to carry the film. It is he, after all, that after 14,000 years never developed a personality of any charm. The telling of the tale is so dull and distant that it seems even he does not believe it.This script is not worthy of off-Broadway theater and the monologues and ideas presented here as insightful and new would not pass scrutiny in a Village coffee shop in the 1950's. Inadequate, insulting, and incredibly overrated.",The Man from Earth
5,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Smart,10,19 April 2010,"This isn't for everyone. It is not a very visual(with that said, the framing is well-done and the editing is tight) film, it's rather simply done(not in a bad way) and there are no FX in it. This is driven entirely by story-telling and dialog. If you are open to having your perceptions challenged and to hear compelling ideas and arguments presented well, this will provide a ton of food for thought. There are ""twists"" to the plot, but it's really not the focus. I will not give away any of the concepts, though I will say that there are those that will find this offensive. The characters are credible and the acting is spot-on. This has a great cast, everyone is well-chosen. Todd is magnificent as always, in one of his least aggressive roles. This is the first time I've seen Katt in, well, not a B-movie, and his performance is impressive. The sense of humor is very good, and the amount is fitting. This has a very well-written and developed script. Unsurprising, as it's from a man who used to do Star Trek: The Original Series and Twilight Zone. The score is appropriate. Sound stood out to me a little, I can't quite place why; not in a negative way. This is largely scientifically and psychologically accurate, though it doesn't hold up to close scrutiny. The ambiguity is nice. There is a little mild language in this. The DVD comes with two fun and interesting commentary tracks(that have infrequent swearing), one with director and Billingsley and one with Emerson(Jerome's son) Bixby and sci-fi scholar Gary Westfahl, as well as four well-done, informative featurettes, coming to 11,5 minutes total. I recommend this to fans of the genre and everyone who enjoys intellectual pictures. 10/10",The Man from Earth
6,view_and_review,My Question was Never Asked or Answered,5,5 April 2021,"Eight people sit in a cabin in the woods--no they weren't brutally murdered, though I think I may have preferred that. They sat spitfiring questions at a man who claims he was Jesus.""The Man from Earth"" is about a man who claims to be 14,000 years old. What began as an interesting chat about the scientific possibilities of a person being 14,000 years old turned into a lecture on the origin of religion (Christianity more specifically). John (David Lee Smith) somberly spoke about his life of 14,000 years and how he was Jesus--not Jesus as has been ""fictionalized,"" but Jesus as a guy who learned some things from Buddha and brought them to the West.Christian or not, I'm sure many people didn't want to settle into a lesson about the fallacies of religion. The entire platform of this movie was to poke holes in religion, which it did with great alacrity. I found it distasteful, but that wasn't my biggest exception taken with the premise of this movie.HOW in the wide wide world of sports did a man survive 14,000 years without being killed either by an accident, an adversary, or a fatal illness? He claimed he doesn't scar, but did he both avoid death and serious injury or maiming? The pseudo-science explaining his not aging was digestible enough, but not freezing to death, not drowning, not being devoured by a predator, killed by an enemy, or any number of a million things is more unbelievable than anything else. The statistical impossibility of surviving 14,000 years cannot be overlooked, yet not one of the brainiacs there broached that subject because they were so fixated on him being Jesus.In the end it was talking, talking, and more talking. Not that I was looking for ""Fast and Furious"" or anything, I was just looking for a break from the monotony and a simple answer to HOW.",The Man from Earth
7,bombersflyup,"Edith: He's everywhere. We just can't see him. Harry: Pfft. If this was the best I could do, I'd be hiding, too.",10,11 October 2018,"The Man From Earth is a perfect film and perhaps the greatest story ever told.Must be, because nothing much else happens. Taking place in one setting and having only discussion, yet wonderful and thought-provoking. Smith and Todd superb, in this low budget masterpiece. I'm a little surprised by the glowing reviews, as no-one usually loves the films I do. I found it less believable that when John was told to end the ruse, that they believed him. Because he couldn't of possibly of made all that up and had an answer for everything and I love Sandy's reason for knowing otherwise. There are things I wish I had kept from a long time ago, but as you move on, you're only thinking about the next thing and don't realize you will one day cherish what you once had.Dan's reaction to hearing it was a ruse, captures the essence of the film perfectly, in that we're all on this journey together and this where his journey ends. The song playing during the credits, also very fitting.",The Man from Earth
8,sddavis63,"A Good Story, But It Does Become Very Heavy As It Goes On",6,21 September 2018,"I really liked the basic premise of this movie. John Oldman (played by David Lee Smith) is a respected university professor who's on the verge of getting tenure when he suddenly decides to pack up and leave it all behind. He gathers a group of friends and colleagues to say good bye. They're confused about why he's leaving when everything seems to be going so well; they're confused because he won't really tell them anything about where he's going. As they question him about these things he decides to share a secret with them - he's really 14000 years old. He never ages (well, he must have aged for a few decades to get where he was, but not since) and he never dies - but every ten years or so he has to pack up and move on because people start to get suspicious about why he never ages. And he unfolds a story about his life and experiences in response to their doubts and questions.Basically I liked this. It's based on a story by the well known science fiction writer Jerome Bixby. He wrote this in the 1960's. Although many would say this is the first time it's been put on film, actually Bixby wrote the original Star Trek episode ""Requiem For Methusaleh"" which was a very similar story about a man who didn't age and didn't die. The story is very philosophical in tone (it's certainly not a thriller or an action movie or even a more typical sci-fi movie) and in that sense it raises as many questions as it answers. It struck me as ""believable"" - in the sense of how this group might respond to being confronted with this story, as they move from thinking it's the basis for a story John wants to write, to thinking it's a joke, to thinking John is insane and, in a couple of cases, to believing him. I thought it became unnecessarily heavy mind you once the rather overt religious angle was introduced (or, you might say, the anti-religious angle.) In that vein, I thought that Edith (the requisite religious character, since this angle was going to be introduced) was a very contradictory character - identified as a biblical literalist who then says she doesn't believe in the virgin birth, the visit of the magi, etc. How could she be a biblical literalist without believing those things. Anyway that part of the story made this movie heavy. It didn't offend me - it just made it less enjoyable and seemed to detract from the philosophical exploration that had been rather compelling.John's history was a bit problematic to me. He knew some great historical figures - from Van Gogh to Buddha to Jesus' apostles - and he claimed to be at least one major historical figure (I won't give that away.) I suppose over 14000 years you'd get to know a few such people, but it just seemed too convenient as a plot device. There was a bit of a shocker revelation at the end which was - again - interesting, but I thought this did end rather too abruptly. It's a simple movie, shot almost entirely within John's cabin, and it's a good composite cast with a lot of familiar faces. It doesn't disappoint, but I did think the veer into controversial religious territory seemed too contrived and unnecessary. (6/10)",The Man from Earth
9,FeastMode,my notes,6,25 June 2019,Pretty good. very interesting. but the entire movie was a group talking in a cabin with low budget actors. still kept me intrigued. Made me think and took the idea to unexpected places (1 viewing),The Man from Earth
10,Cineanalyst,New Age Nonsense,5,5 April 2019,"There's something amusing about people taking seriously something so patently ridiculous. Not the basic fantasy premise of immortality, which like others I find intriguing, nor mostly the meager production values, which could easily be overlooked if the narrative was more mentally engaging, but the pretensions of ""The Man from Earth"" to academia and intellectualism are sophomoric. It's an hour-and-a-half of a 14,000-year-old man demonstrating an inability to impart any wisdom beyond vague misapprehensions regarding Buddhist spirituality and hints to the benefits of Eastern medicine and a Paleolithic diet. He's a history professor who continues to purport the myth that Columbus set out to prove that the world is round. He tells his life story to a supposed group of fellow professors, and their discussion still derails into a silly argument over religion, which is the reason, I suppose, that there's also a sensitive Christian zealot in the room. Perhaps, the only believable character here is the college student, because she may be the only one credibly young and naive enough to consider this absurdity enlightening.Such a concept would probably have seemed more clever in the format of a ""Star Trek"" or ""The Twilight Zone"" TV episode, for which the author of this movie, Jerome Bixby, previously honed his sci-fi talk-fest chops. Indeed, ""The Man from Earth"" is similar to an entry in ""The Twilight Zone"" entitled ""Long Live Walter Jameson,"" which is also about an immortal history professor confronted by a fellow academic, although, from there, the story's lesson is considerably different. Drawn out as a feature-length film, updated with some New-Age hooey, it becomes quite stupid. I do like, however, that characters within the movie refer to the situation as a potential screenplay and that one of them specifically references ""Star Trek."" Yet, even overlooking the poor production values (especially the lousy sound and score--telltale signs of a low budget), this is essentially a filmed play--even more so than ""The Twilight Zone"" episode--and a badly directed one at that. The furniture movers, in particular, are a conspicuous bit of business employed as an excuse for blocking, and the gun stuff is even worse. Earnestness may be silly, though, and bad can turn good, or at least unintentionally humorous.",The Man from Earth

12,851222,Interesting,8,16 November 2014,"Greetings from Lithuania.""The Man from Earth"" (2007) is not your typical Sci-Fi drama. Set in one place, using only words, it lets the story as big as life. Should you believe this story or not, it's up to you, nevertheless it a very interesting tale. Performances are OK, clearly this low budget movie was made for TV, but the screenplay - that what makes this movie hardly forgettable.Overall, ""The Man from Earth"" (2007)ia a good way to spend 87 min. if you already tired from all Marvel Sci-Fi stuff, it's a very low budget drama, with average performances but brilliant idea and script, you will hardly forget this picture after seeing it.",The Man from Earth
13,sol-,The Man Who Was There,8,10 March 2017,"Pressured by work colleagues into revealing why he is abruptly moving away, a university professor asks his friends to consider the possibility that he is an immortal who has survived from the stone age to modernity in this highly unusual sci-fi drama. Unlike most contemporary science fiction films, there are no special effects, no cool technology and all the action takes place in a single location with tension, mystery and suspense derived from dialogue exchanges alone. Some have complained that the film is not very cinematic, and it does feel like a stage play at times, but this daringness to be different mostly works in the film's favour with nothing to distract from the offbeat premise. It is a fascinating notion too -- being able to live through history unaware of the significance of certain events at the time -- but even more interesting than the central idea is the way his colleagues react. At first there is a lot of scoffing and shaking of heads, but as he continues to tell his tale in deadpan seriousness, his friends grow increasingly intrigued, especially given that there is ""no way to disprove"" what he is saying. It even reaches the point at which it seems like all of them believe him, asking prodding questions about what it is like to live throughout the ages. The ending - which forgoes all ambiguity as to whether or not he is making it all up - may be a misstep, but even with a clear answer plastered at the end, this is still a captivating look at how easy it is to become swayed from sheer disbelief to genuine questioning when one listens to a story for long enough.",The Man from Earth
14,merklekranz,"A hoax......like the ""Cardiff Giant""........the gullible will believe ...",6,12 December 2008,"Intriguing premise for a hoax, squarely aimed at a very gullible group of intellectuals. A hoax can only be successful if people want to believe in it. Unfortunately the audience will be shaking their heads as the professors are meekly lead down the path by the hoaxer. There are obvious questions that would expose the entire story as nonsense, but they are never asked. If you don't have a working knowledge of the Bible, the second half of ""The Man From Earth"", might leave you in the dark. The story is original, the acting is top notch, but unless you look upon this as a finely tuned hoax on the professors, you, the audience, will become bewildered. - MERK",The Man from Earth

The twilight zone's well known episode, it's a good life with Billy Mumy as a little boy with supernatural powers was a 1961 script based on Mr. Bixby's short story.

16,ebiros2,Similar to an episode of Star Trek TOS,5,3 July 2012,"Not a main stream movie by any means. The topic may be relevant to Christians and Westerners, but to those who have no religious back ground in Christianity, the story is - well, just another story.The movie is entirely constructed out of dialogs. It's also done in only one room. There're no scenery changes except at the very end. That should tell you something about the unusual premise of this movie. So the movie is somewhat small scale, and maybe better fit as a TV movie. If this movie was an episode of Star Trek, and Flint was the name of the main character, reprising his role from another episode of Star Trek TOS, it would have been sensational.In a way, this movie is another version of that Star Trek episode which Jerome Bixby wrote the script.Jerome Bixby saved this story for the very end. Perhaps the subject of immortal man playing major figures in history was a concept that intrigued him deeply.",The Man from Earth
17,ackstasis,A science-fiction film built on ideas,8,13 January 2008,"It's a sad truth that the vast proportion of modern science-fiction films exist solely as visual-effects showcases, discarding any notions of intelligence in favour of the latest CGI technology. However, necessity is also the mother of invention, and, given a minuscule budget with which to produce a film, some filmmakers uncover enough talent to compensate for their monetary shortcomings, relying on good writing to make their film great. A film that emerged from nowhere {thanks primarily to illegal BitTorrent downloading, according to producer Eric D. Wilkinson}, Richard Schenkman's 'The Man from Earth (2007)' is one of the most intelligent, thought-provoking science-fiction films I've seen in a very long time. Overflowing with fascinating scenarios and revolutionary possibilities, it is a sci-fi film built entirely on ideas. The excellent screenplay was written by Jerome Bixby, a notable science-fiction author, who also penned the monster flick 'It! The Terror from Beyond Space (1958).' The concept behind this particular film was first envisioned in the 1960s, though it wasn't until 1998 that Bixby completed the story.It seems like a scenario that might have been snatched from the pages of a science-fiction novel: imagine that an unaging Cro-Magnon cave-man has survived for the last 14000 years, enduring millennia of dramatically-changing lifestyles and landscapes. This man has seen the rise and fall of leaders, empires and religions; the transition from nomadic clans to villages to towering metropolises. As the human race understood more and more about the world around him, so, too, did this survivor continue to learn. Now imagine that a fellow co-worker, whom you have known for the past ten years, suddenly declares himself to be such a man! On the eve of his departure from a college, John Oldman (David Lee Smith) hosts an impromptu farewell party at his vacated residence. To the surprise of his colleagues, given his reputation as an honest and sensible man, John begins to make these controversial assertions about his identity, raising countless irresistible scientific, philosophical and theological questions.Stylistically, 'The Man from Earth' most closely resembles Sidney Lumet's '12 Angry Men (1957),' in that both films take place, with a few minutes' exception, in the one room, and rely heavily on dialogue to propel the plot. The performers here are, of course, light-years away from the likes of Henry Fonda and Jack Warden, but, in a picture dominated by words over actions, each actor brings an interesting personality to the table. I was particularly impressed with David Lee Smith, who gives to the leading character a mixture of confidence, mystery and sincerity that is perfect for the role. The other actors, including John Billingsley, Ellen Crawford, William Katt, Richard Riehle, Annika Peterson and Tony Todd, do well at representing their given professions, evaluating John's outlandish claims using specialist knowledge of their respective fields. The weakest performance comes from Alexis Thorpe as student Linda Murphy, who is really given very little to do, and would have served the film better if she had been removed entirely.Though Jerome Bixby's screenplay is undoubtedly intelligently-written, I found myself dissatisfied with the conclusion to the story - John's relationship with Sandy (Annika Peterson) was too hackneyed to be taken seriously, and the final twist involving Dr. Will Gruber (Richard Riehle) was much too contrived. In my view, the film should have ended with John ""admitting"" to everyone that the story was merely a playful fabrication, leaving both the characters and the audience with a niggling sensation of uncertainty: was John telling the truth, after all? As it is, the current ending leaves us is no doubt that John is, indeed, a Cro-Magnon from 14000 years ago, but there are some things that we shouldn't need to be told with complete certainty. A more ambiguous ending would most definitely provoke intense further discussion, which is, I think, the most that any science-fiction film could ever strive to do.",The Man from Earth
18,drqshadow-reviews,"High Concept, Low Production Standards",8,1 May 2012,"An extremely low-budget, imagination-dependent work of ambitious science fiction, this is a textbook example of substance over style. Set at the farewell after-party for a beloved college professor, it picks up just as the departing prof announces to a small gathering of colleagues that he's been alive since the dawn of humanity. What follows is an uncut, stream-of-consciousness conversation between the confident subject and his bewildered, skeptical friends as they try to punch holes in his story and decide if he's spouting truth or fiction. The screenplay is a work of art, slowly gathering steam as the speaker's claims grow larger and wilder. At every step along the way, his audience analyzes the latest revelations from a variety of angles, working through their own misgivings and gradually convincing both themselves and the viewers that there might just be some fire beneath all the smoke. Sadly, the brilliant plot deserved a better production; bland, redundant camera angles capture a dozen performances on par with bad community theater. It's horribly overacted, with a clunky cast of misfits and journeymen that couldn't find chemistry in a high school textbook. Still, I can't help but wonder how much of the simplicity that fuels this project would have been lost in the hands of a large, glitzier production.

This is easily the best screenplay from 2007, regardless of the other big films. In fact, it is probably the best screenplay of the 21st century. Make no mistake; this is the writer's film. The story of a professor moving away from his friends turns out to be an epiphany. Any group of actors directed by any director would have had the same result. ""We believe what we want to believe"".

21,I_Ailurophile,"Fascinating and refreshing, if imperfect",8,2 July 2021,"'The man from Earth' is science fiction fantasy in concept, not in presentation. It is consciously, inescapably low-key - subdued, restrained, laid-back. The narrative consists wholly of dialogue - recounting history, personal and global; philosophizing, hypothesizing amidst friends and colleagues. There are no active flashbacks, no action scenes, not even a change of scenery beyond the interior or exterior of the abode where the characters are gathered.And it's both endearing and engrossing.The production is staggering in its simplicity, yet weirdly impressive in its craft. Just look at the cast: Richard Riehle, Tony Todd, John Billingsley. Uncomplicated and direct as the performances are, all involved here are great. I'm personally less familiar with Ellen Crawford, William Katt, but the same goes for them.Writer Jerome Bixby, having died several long years before 'The man from Earth' was made, had some very notable credits to his name, and still this screenplay may well be his very greatest achievement. The same goes for director Richard Schenkman, whose list of past works rather seems to culminate with this. His camerawork here is plain and unremarkable, but he pointedly fixes his eye on each actor as the screenplay demands. As much as the film consciously eschews any sense of dynamics, the final emotional beat of the story is told as well with the pen as it is conveyed by the camera, and is a superb capstone.The end result is a bewitching exploration of an idea, presented as realistically and as plausibly as I think is possible: What if an individual, by genetic quirk, did not age? What if a man living in contemporary times were, in fact, thousands of years old?Tantalizing and excellent as the film is, 'The man from Earth' is not perfect. I personally feel that Mark Hinton Stewart's score, fine as it may be, is altogether unnecessary in its use as background musical accompaniment. Between Schenkman's direction and Neil Grieve's editing, the film is paced much too quickly for my preferences. Ideally this should have been a fair bit longer than 90 minutes: A more patient vision would have allowed more time for crucial story beats, lines of dialogue, and character interactions to manifest, breathe, and digest. As it is, the conversation moves along so quickly that I found myself doubling back multiple times to catch something I missed the first time around. In a feature where the dialogue is paramount, that's inexcusable.Even with these flaws in its realization, though, the screenplay is a treasure, and the greatest contributor to the movie's success. It would be so easy for a tale like this to be needlessly inflated with fiery bombast - an active investigation by police or reporters, chases, suspense, throwing of objects and emotional outbursts. That 'The man from Earth' deliberately dispenses with all such notions is a further credit to Bixby's legacy. The substance of the film is in the discussion and analysis, and anything beyond would have been superfluous.There's not much more to say. This is a film appropriate for all audiences, though of course anyone who's not receptive to a picture centered exclusively on dialogue may be put out.

Great script and the acting was adequate to the tale. I really recommend this movie to any fan of sci-fi and good movies. It sometime lacked more punch in the story-telling and some of the actors misqueued deliveries, but ultimately a big success for the director.I have some minor issues with the script which could use a bit more polish, but it's still impressive. C'mon? They talk for 87 minutes of the movie, there is no action, but still your totally fixated on what is going on in the movie.

A $200,000.00 production that has all the feel of a stage play, with three set pieces. Reactions have been from ""bored"" to ""brilliant"". It was so wordy that I fell asleep but, then, upon waking, I watched what I had missed (I don't review things I haven't completed). I'm going to take the middle road. It has the feel of a writers' room, spitballing on a movie premise. It pulls from a speculative understanding of both science and religion, and, depending on which you worship, it will eventually offend devotees of either. It gets knocked for poor acting but I disagree. The actors were faithful to their characters and the tone of the piece.

28,ElijahCSkuggs,"Fun, Story Driven Film Flawed by Cliché Characters and Average Acting",8,12 November 2007,"I'm kind of surprised by all the love this movie is getting. Not to say I didn't like it, I enjoyed it quite a bit actually. But I see people giving it perfect scores and all that jazz. A perfect ten? That's overdoing it a little bit.The Man From Earth is about a man who tells his group of friends, who all happen to be professors or wannabe intellectuals, that every ten years he has to pack up and move. Why? Because he doesn't age and he doesn't want his secret to be discovered. Huh? Because he's a caveman, who's lived over 14,000 years due to a perfect working human body. The movie is simply this man, John, answering question after question and telling stories about his long, event filled life due to the his friends not believing him. You'd think this would be a boring mess, but it's really a fun film. You have a plethora of characters, from the ""Cool"" professor type, the all knowing psychologist, a geeky wise-cracking biology professor, a black level-headed professor, a strict Christian, the girl friend, and a beautiful young student who is possibly banging the ""Cool"" professor. You may see this wide variety of characters a unique touch, which for this type of movie it kinda is. But it's also incredibly clichéd, and it feels that way quite often. They deliver and act how that specific character is supposed to act. The Strict Christian had the Motherly/Homemade sweater look, the ""Cool Professor"" had the leather jacket and facial hair and so on for each character. I'm guessing it was a safety measure. But even though this ""problem"" exists (I put it in quotations because it's not really a problem if I'm the only it really bugs) the characters do their jobs right, and it moves the picture at a quick pace. I have only one other problem with the film. And that's the acting. As soon as the film starts, if you know anything about acting, you'll know that it's average at best. Especially the opening scene to the film. But as the movie goes on, the actors get in a groove and some actually do deliver good performances, especially Candyman. The one who is the weakest unfortunately is John, who plays the supposed Caveman. He's delivers his lines in a soft spoken way the entire time, with no emotion, and only a handful of expression/mannerisms. Well, I'm a slight stickler for acting, you may not be and may be more a story driven person. And for you, this movie was made.The film as I said before moves at a fast pace, since huge issues of friendship, religion, and humanity arise. It's nonstop talking but it's filled with a smart script (sometimes too smart with the vocabulary) and led by an intriguing story. Some say it's a SciFi film, it is, but I'd rather say it's a Drama with a SciFi theme. Anyways, The Man From Earth was a nice surprise and I'm happy I took the chance to see this movie. 7.5 outta 10.",The Man from Earth
29,ODDBear,Interesting,7,13 March 2010,"Entirely spoiler driven review.""Well Jesus was a man, who traveled through the land. A hard working man and brave"" wrote Woody Guthrie in his folk song simply entitled ""Jesus Christ"". But was Jesus really a caveman who simply wouldn't die and just kept on living. Well, if so, even that Woody Guthrie song wouldn't be wrong.As John Oldman (Smith) gets ready to leave yet another place his friends and colleagues don't want him to leave without a proper goodbye. Touched by their gesture, and somewhat itching to reveal himself, Oldman discloses the reason why he continually keeps moving on every 10 years or so and never settles down; he's in fact a Cro-Magnum caveman who's 14.000 years old. Along the way he's met some famous people (Van Gough among them) and, oh yes, he was also that biblical guy we know as Jesus Christ.Naturally this doesn't go all that well with his friends and colleagues who fear John may have gone off the deep end. The entire movie takes place in John's cabin where he explains his life and slowly convinces the troupe of it's truth. Is this man in fact a 14.000 year old caveman or simply a terrific liar? Well, you'll never know. You either believe him or you don't. Like faith itself, it's not very logical but anything's possible, right? In fact, the film goes on for about 3 minutes too long with a needles revelation that sort of undermines the undeniably excellent dialog and solid performances that leave the viewer in deep thought.""The Man From Earth"" is a very simple and an entirely dialog driven movie and that's what gives it it's charm. The low-key approach, solid performances and interesting discussions make it a thought provoking little sleeper hit that deserves even more recognition.

30,fwomp,Treatist On Human-Kind,8,19 April 2008,"John Oldman (David Lee Smith) has been a history professor for ten years and is now preparing to move away from the school he's dedicated a decade to. The reasons are initially his own until a group of his fellow friends and professors come by to say goodbye and he drops a bombshell on them; he claims to be a caveman who's lived eons and eons, witnessing historical events and even being part of that history that we thought we knew.The group of professors that come by to send him off are a complex group: a religious studies professor, another that's an English prof, a psych prof, and a few others that round out a pretty decent world view.Initially all of John's fellow colleagues challenge him, but his arguments are solid and disturbing. But is John for real? Or does he need psychotropic medications? The thing about THE MAN FROM EARTH is that it's a stage-play put into film form. The entire movie is pure character exposition and dialogue with no action, flashbacks, or other techniques most movie-goers have become accustomed to. And this is both a strength and a weakness. The strength comes from the strong scripting of the dialogue that keeps the viewer interested and wondering how it will all pan out. The weakness is that it makes for incredibly slow pacing. Thankfully the The Man From Earth is only 87 minutes long, not stretching out its length and thus causing great yawns from the watchers.The other strength within the movie is the acting. All of the characters were believable and the actors and actresses played their parts very well (being frustrated or angry or sad or scared, etc.). But the filming was tough to watch. Too many times the shots looked grainy or underexposed, giving it a B-movie feel; that was unfortunate.Even so, this is an interesting treatise on humanity and how we might deal with the unexplainable should a friend thrust a near impossible quandary upon us.",The Man from Earth

The results have been mixed; sometimes quite good. But I usually feel I can see the seams; you can detect the smell of a creative production line. Although it took its cues from a simple core concept, The Man from Earth doesn't feel like it. It feels organic and whole and genuine. This is true drama; and it's got a killer concept at its heart--one to have thoughtful viewers pondering for years to come.If you like great drama and fantastic dialog, watch it.",The Man from Earth

The dialog is just that well-written - it's not high drama, no, but it's high concept, and even if it's hard to believe in any of the characters, the debate itself is fascinating enough to be enjoyed throughout. The downside is that the acting, directing and especially god awful music still feel like a mediocre play.

34,jrarichards,Make your best effort not to give up on this,9,8 August 2018,"There are several points in Richard Schenkman's ""The Man from Earth"" in which differently-motivated watchers may feel inclined to reach for the ""off"" switch. The first time will be about 10-15 minutes in, and the motivation will relate either to the basic sci fi premise (no spoilers, but it's bound to be an instant turnoff for some), or to a query from many a typical filmgoer as to how interesting 5 or 6 University types questioning their close, about-to-leave, colleague John Oldman (David Lee Smith) in a remote cottage somewhere can really get! On the latter score the makers do as much as they can, as the ""solid front"" of clone-like colleagues rapidly disperses into displays from each of different emotions, different attitudes. Aggression, disbelief, mockery, cynicism, acceptance are all released, but above them all is the spirit of eager scientific inquiry and open-mindedness that OUGHT TO BE present in every academic. We of science do our jobs by hypothesis-testing and taking nothing for granted, nothing at face value. And here a cerebral script allows the most to be made of that desirable truth about academics.Nevertheless, Ellen Crawford serves increasingly well as the uptight religious one (notwithstanding her academic side), while John Billingsley is there in his typical kindly+witty avuncular role. Then there is the coolly sarcastic hip one and his beautiful young girlfriend/student who represents the openness of youth, and then there is that ever-welcome player Tony Todd as the kindly, accepting, philsophical one. That leaves Richard Riehle as the psychiatrist who wants to help - but is also ultimately the most aggressive responder to the situation.Together, this crew throw themselves at John from as many different angles as you can easily think of - not only scientific; and as the time passes this interaction gets richer and richer. Furthermore, it's not all between each individually and John, but also via a web of connections across the group, which makes things interesting. A few other plot twists creep in to further diversify the format.The Ellen Crawford character wants to ""switch off"" at one key point, and there are many in the audience who will likely find themselves tempted to do likewise. I surprised myself by being in this group, thinking a step too far had been taken. But I plucked up the courage to come back to it, and don't regret it, as the film's best work is done after this point, and some worthwhile (if definitely somewhat uncomfortable) questions about religion are raised, in a very clever way.Indeed, the film starts off looking stilted and rather faux-intellectual but definitely ends up looking like the real thing. Did the actors get into what they were doing? Or is it an adjustment from the audience? Either way, it's fascinating how it happens. Wherever you look in this film you will see the name Bixby, mostly - though not solely - Jerome Bixby. He's behind a shockingly unforgettable piece of sci fi from 1953 called ""It's a Good Life"", which sets an ENTIRELY different tone from ""The Man from Earth"". On the other hand, the idea used here got its first outing when Bixby wrote the ""Requiem for Methusaleh"" episode of the original ""Star Trek"", so anybody who's a fan of ""ST:TOS"" will recognise elements of this.And sweetly, ST is referred to in the film, several of whose actors have also appeared in different manifestations of ""Trek"", so that's a pleasing side-effect for those in the know.Main message: this is ultimately a far better quality film than you can imagine at the outset, so do stick with it...",The Man from Earth

The initial premise is fantastic... one that will surely be remade by some BigTime producer on a 150 million dollar budget that wants to make an epic movie. Here....we have the skeleton of what could become a great movie. The message never comes across here. What we have is a great idea that put a filmmaker WAY WAY over his head.

36,RJBurke1942,Where the mystery of aging is perhaps not so mysterious,9,3 December 2014,"Who has not fantasized about living forever? Could we even hack it? This movie is intellectually stimulating, philosophically fascinating and medically interesting; and, it's quietly entertaining to boot. While watching, it occurred to me the mise en scène - where a group of eight people meet to bid farewell to one of them, with 95% of the 'action' in one room - reminded me of 12 Angry Men (1957), My dinner with Andre (1981), The Sunset Limited (2011) and a few others.The stand-out feature is the script: written by the late Jerome Bixby (writer of Star Trek episodes and others), he explores the possibility of living for thousands of years and perhaps - theoretically - forever. This is not complete nonsense: other animals on this earth live for many hundreds of years, while flat worms and a type of jellyfish are in fact virtually immortal (according to scientific articles I researched).So, how would you react when one in your group announces he's been walking the earth for 14,000 years? How would you begin to tackle the truth of that claim? Could you prove the claim false? Would you - mortal, vulnerable, with limited years - feel angry, cheated, or thwarted? Would you even lash out to the point of wanting to kill?The actors do an adequate job of presenting that scenario as their reactions play through all of those emotions, and more. All the while, John Oldman (David Lee Smith) maintains his cool, calm exterior, adroitly fielding all the questions, accusations and admonitions. Hence, the script, as constructed, hangs together quite well. Towards the end, though, the discussion gets into the most sensitive areas of the human psyche - religion and spirituality - and presents a situation that will definitely offend many believers. And, if that's not enough to swallow, Bixby then adds an incisive twist which, given the scenario, is entirely logical, psychologically harrowing and cleverly convincing.Oldman, at one stage, says he's not a ""superman"". Yet, to live forever, or even a mere 14,000 years, would require a ""superman"" intellect and perfect body. Well, the first is already possible, obviously, when considering history. It only remains to be seen whether science will eventually solve the mystery of aging. I think science will.Given the subject matter and the presentation, this is a nine out ten movie for me. See if you agree. Recommended for all.December 4th, 2014",The Man from Earth

Jerome Bixby wrote such beautiful stories for Star Trek and the Twilight Zone. But this script was clearly unfinished when he died, very rough and unrealized with no sense of living characters. I really don't know what his son was thinking of, whether it was really just a cheap way to turn a fast buck or honoring his father's legacy.The science fiction ""hook"" is exactly that of ""Requiem for Methusaleh"" which Jerome Bixby wrote more than fifty years ago. This is the same concept, without a suspenseful plot, a sense of adventure, or likeable characters to root for as the man talks and talks and talks about his many past lives. It's really sad how a given concept can be haunting and enchanting in two minutes and crushingly dull in two hours.And by the way, sexism of the old Star Trek series is still present, even under all the mummified science fiction stuff. There are two attractive young women who serve as eye candy for two hours, while the one mature woman is allowed to do nothing but scold like a wet hen and burst into tears every time she's proven wrong . . .

A guy lives 14,000 years and has no deeper thoughts than those expressed in this film? I took the time to watch this based on the reviews and found myself terribly disappointed. As is frequently stated throughout the movie, ""All of this could have come out of books!"" (And how surprising, since they are all academics.) The film is not as anti-Christian as some reviewers would have you believe, unless you are a terribly sensitive Christian. Not recommended for people who are interested in an intellectual challenge. (BTW, I have both graduate and undergraduate degrees in anthropology, so I have a tiny bit of experience in related fields.)Added note: After reading many other reviews, I felt that I simply had to come back and add a final comment. If you are one of those reviewers gushing about how ""original"" or ""startling"" the premise of this movie is, then you have missed a great many short stories, novels, television shows, plays, and movies that address precisely the same subjects and have similar plots. I mean, Mel Brooks was doing it as a comedy routine 40 years ago.

We don't get to see the protagonist interact with the world. Have you ever heard the phrase ""show, don't tell""? It's a writer's maxim that it's better to be direct rather than indirect with your plot line.Eight people sitting in a house talking is too much ""tell"". The story could easily just be two people talking, as in K-PAX, which is far better.The dialogue is awful (I thought it was the acting originally but that was wrong). There's no story arc (nothing is at stake). This would be boring even as a theatre production (where having a single location is more accepted).It's not enough for a story to be intellectually interesting. It has also be a story. The Man From Earth is not. It is all premise and very much reflects the goofy overly simplistic Sci-Fi days of the 1960s. And guess what, that's where the film's writer Jerome Bixby comes from.

42,phenomynouss,neat little thing,7,19 June 2020,"Little?This is a neat little film, done almost entirely in a cabin, consisting largely of a man telling a group of people a story. They are all university professors and one of them, John Oldman, is retiring and leaving, and decides he wants to tell this batch of friends his secret; he is a primal man born roughly 14,000 years ago who inexplicably is immortal.
Somehow he has avoided being killed all this time, and has sustained himself by essentially leaving his niche community every 10 years or so before people notice he does not age.
The storytelling he does is indeed compelling, although it's a bit frustrating, almost intentionally so. The man is very learned and all his friends cover subjects that would be necessary for him to tell a story like this; anthropology, history, archaeology, language, psychology, etcetera.The vast majority of what he regales them with is essentially common knowledge for an academic with easy access to dense textbooks and primary sources throughout history. His stories are almost ridiculously convenient, paling around with van Gogh, Buddha, always famous people right at the height of their fame. (This is even referenced in the sequel, ""(they) always claim to be Napoleon, Alexander, Cleopatra, never Cleopatra's maid or the guy who cleaned her chamber pot."")
The film treats this as an asset, as we are not directly told or invited to immediately accept this guy's story as factual. He has convenient excuses for any lapses in his story (he forgot stuff, only tends to remember that which was really significant to him personally), and has conveniently avoided collecting artifacts along his life, and also refuses to go to a medical facility to test his blood or anything of that sort.
This sort of tale is really compelling, and the film as a whole relies entirely upon it. The only downside, in my opinion, is that John Oldman's reasoning for leaving out facts, or for avoiding certain direct questions comes across as specious or even just flat-out arrogant. He comes up with excuses on the spot that only frustrate his audience (and us). It starts to feel at some point like he is regretting his decision to come out to his friends and is thus padding down his story to give plausible deniability to it. This would have been a neat decision if the film leaves itself ambiguous. Unfortunately it doesn't.
My other minor problem was that some of the other professors' dialogue was cliché or otherwise repetitive.",The Man from Earth

The actual execution is a sub-par TV flick with adequate acting. The pace is slow, since the obvious intention has been to stretch the script to the 87 minutes.I'm still not sure who the target audience would be.

Strong script, decent performance, and a good deal of drama all played out in one small living room. Excellent historical and speculative knowledge, everything feels real and makes sense.

A little history about this film: Jerome Bixby, who was one of the writers for ""The Twilight Zone"", conceived the screenplay in the early 1960s, but did not complete until his death bed in 1998. The film gained recognition in part for being widely distributed through Internet peer- to-peer networks; its producer publicly thanked users of these networks for this. The film was later adapted by director Richard Schenkman into a stage play of the same name. In fact, I remember thinking what a great play this movie would make since the whole thing is dialogue that basically takes place in one setting.The plot focuses on John Oldman (David Lee Smith), a departing university professor, who claims to be a Cro-Magnon (or Magdalenian caveman) that has somehow survived for more than 14,000 years. The entire film is set in and around Oldman's house during his farewell party and is composed almost entirely of dialogue. The plot advances through intellectual arguments between Oldman and his fellow faculty members.*Possible SPOILER* If you are of a religious background, you will probably have some major problems with where the story ultimately treads, just to be warned. I see that IGN (Imagine Games Network) referred to this movie as ""Intellectual Sci-fi"" and THAT is a brilliant way of looking at this... The cast is mostly made up of non-household names, but nevertheless a group of people you will probably recognize from various things here and there- besides Smith (who I remember from a few episodes of TV's ""CSI: Miami""), John Billingsley, William Katt, Richard Riehle, Alexis Thorpe, Ellen Crawford and Tony Todd.",The Man from Earth

Too bad as this has all the makings for a great series otherwise.

Being said, the film, from a technical stand point, is a mess. Editing is rather poor, typical of low-micro budget films. The quality is very low in the acting as well. And I mean, the actors put effort, but it was horrible. The interpretation was even worse(due the film being wordier, I suppose) and there were some unintentionally ridiculous moments, which, again, I suppose wasn't worked better because of the budget.But yeah, the script has great potential. With top production values, this film has a chance of being a possible '12 Angry Men' of our times. Because the screenplay is THAT good.

The plot lies in the dialogue and there are no twists and turns, just a constant barrage of questions and answers that beg more questions and just overwhelm you with a raw sense of how tiny and vain human life is in contrast to how grand the universe is. If you need a fresh break from mindless violence and useless comedy, this is one of the most intellectual movies you can watch.",The Man from Earth
49,flingebunt,A movie for the pseudo intellectual,4,19 December 2016,"So the story starts with the going away party for John Oldman who decides to tell his friends the ""story"" of his life, which turns out starts in the cro magnon period of humanity. Basically John claims to be immortal and has lived for 14,000 years. Okay, so the whole thing is, we are like his friends, do we believe his story or not? What is history, how can we know what has happened in the past, and so on.It is a movie of talking heads, which might be interesting if there was a little more to the story, like actually understanding of history or human nature. In the end he isn't telling this story for any particular reason, nothing is solved as nothing is really challenged. What is worse, rather than leaving us guessing, which should have been the point, they decide to resolve it for us. An interesting film, but basically wasted and disappointing. For people who like to talk about stuff that doesn't matter.",The Man from Earth
50,jose-cruz53,One of the best talkies around,8,5 December 2012,"This film is very different from other films in that it doesn't have anything besides talk. Yes, it is just a bunch of people talking to each other for two hours inside a house. That's it. The most audio-visual experience one has in the film is when they play the second movement from Beethoven's 7th symphony (a movement that has been called the greatest song ever made by some classical composers and critics).It is a very interesting smart film but it is not smart in the sense of an art-house film but more in the sense of a philosophical novel. This is really the reproduction of a dialog driven novel on screen rather than something that could be said to be appropriate to the film medium. It is not a bad film but it is also not a masterpiece of cinema by any means.",The Man from Earth
51,Miles-10,"Writer goes beyond what he knows, in this talky movie",3,10 April 2020,"The premise of ""The Man from Earth"" is that a college professor, about to leave town forever, tries to prove to his colleagues that he is 14,000 years old, as they try to poke holes in his story. Is John Oldman telling the truth or is he putting them on? (The professor's name BTW is John Oldman, and in case you don't get the pun, one of the characters points it out near the end.)This premise raises many questions, starting with: Why the imprecise title? Aren't all the men in the movie from earth? And the women, too, for that matter? The script is by Jerome Bixby, a sci-fi and fantasy writer who touched on a somewhat similar theme in one of his old ""Star Trek"" scripts (""Methuselah"", from 1969). Bixby died almost a decade before this movie's release, but, without information to the contrary, I will hold him largely responsible for the film's great shortcomings as well as its meager virtues.Although the movie's premise is an intriguing one - as Bixby, speaking through several of his characters, keeps telling us - it seems to be written by someone who does not have the requisite knowledge of scientific and historical subjects to make John's story plausible, even if we are willing to entertain the possibility that someone might have lived for 14,000 years. I am not spoiling whether John is telling his friends the truth or a hypothetical story, which he allows for from the outset. For the movie to be credible, though, his audience - representing supposed scholars in fields including history, anthropology, and biology - should not be less able than the audience to poke holes in his story.This movie would have been better if Bixby had known more about intellectual history (When does Bixby think humans figured out that the earth isn't flat, for example?) or things like the difference between a psychiatrist and psychologist. Then the repartee might have left me appreciative rather than rolling my eyes. Instead, Bixby exceeds what he knows enough to talk about, and does so in an awfully talky movie. Everything depends on audience involvement in the ideas being discussed, and once they fall flat, the whole movie does, too.There are so many flaws in the understanding of both scientific and historical issues here that I find myself wishing that someone like the late Michael Crichton had tackled this premise instead of Bixby and director Richard Shenkman, who obviously did not know enough to correct Bixby's errors.One problem that comes up right away is that John claims that he stopped aging when he was 35 years old. His story generally accounts for the fact that, back then, he had no way of knowing much about his historical context since history had not been written yet. By the same token, though, he could never have been sure of his own exact age when he stopped aging. He should have allowed that he only knew his apparent age approximately based on comparison with other people. Then, too, 14,000 years ago, 35 would have been considered old at a time when most people never reached 40 - John also looks as if he must have discovered skincare products early on.Eventually, John tells his captivated audience what he knows, first-hand, about the origins of Christianity, and he makes everything he says needlessly complicated not to say fanciful. (It's a version of the dubious Jesus-survived-the-cross story.)John's friends become frustrated and even hostile as they find they cannot disprove his account, and while I confess to being glad for the drama, their suspicion and distrust seem overblown. At a couple of points, one or another of his colleagues accuses him of being a psychic vampire. What John is claiming to be is an immortal (as in the movie ""Highlander"") as well as engaging in a serious version of Mel Brooks and Carl Reiner's ""2000 Year Old Man"" routines.In middle of all this, movers arrive to take John's furniture (he is, after all, leaving town and his cottage, never to return), but nobody misses a beat. The movers must wonder: What are these people talking about? Yet they say nothing. (In a real situation, I would admire their professionalism, but in this film, their obliviousness seems unnerving.)The acting is very good if not great. You might see familiar faces in the cast without being able to place which bit parts you have previously seen these actors in. The cast includes Tony Todd of ""Candyman"", ""The Crow"", Chuck"", and ""The Young and the Restless""; John Billingsley of ""True Blood"", ""24"", and ""Star Trek: Enterprise""; Ellen Crawford of ""ER"", ""Boston Legal"", and many more; William Katt of ""The Greatest American Hero"" and ""Carrie""; and Richard Riehle of ""Casino"", ""Office Space"", ""Star Trek: Enterprise"", ""The Young and the Restless"", ""NCIS"", ""Grounded for Life"", ""The West Wing"", ""Ally McBeal"", and ""Deuce Bigelow: Male Gigolo"".)There is a sequel to this movie, and although it promises a more dynamic plot (rather than everybody sitting around John's living room), I am not going to see it because the original is so disappointing.",The Man from Earth

The actors seem uncomfortable, the staging desperate and uninspired and the filming & editing apparently left to a novice.. Story wise, there is nothing to observe here worth mentioning.

58,Rabh17,Thoughtful play,8,15 March 2009,"I often hear the phrase Sci-Fi used alongside this movie, which put me off when I realized that there was none of the usual special FX hi-jinks and action I would come to expect from something billed as Sci-Fi. It would be similar to watching an episode of Star Trek only to see all the actors sitting in a cabin and drinking wine and talking and the viewer feeling gypped of his time and money. Reading the other reviews here helped me decide to actually watch it-- but I had to wait a day or two to be in the right mood to watch without prejudice.Don't think of this movie not as Sci-Fi, but as a Play.A Man admits to his friends and colleagues that he is nearly immortal and has lived throughout human History. Now what would their reactions be? There isn't anything wildly Sci-Fi about the concept. All it would theoretically take is a genetic mutation, a DNA fluke. No superpowers. No lightning bolts from the fingers. Just the ability of the body to continue to repair itself-- endlessly. What would such a person be like? Or would it be just as shocking to hear that he or she is as normal as You & me? What would YOUR reaction, and those of your close friends be, if one of your own friends stood up at a quiet party and announced the same thing? And he was serious? What would you believe? What would you think afterward? What questions would you ask? What proofs would you demand? Would it matter?That's what this movie is about. Friendship, Belief and Disbelief. Intelligence and dialogue and questions taking place in a very ordinary house with everyone sitting around in the livingroom, wrestling with their own innate disbelief.The movie had a very ordinary pace-- like a discussion over a dinner table during a late afternoon with friends. Different. Mature.",The Man from Earth
59,huh_oh_i_c,"No plot holes, but ... ""what's my motivation?""",8,2 December 2007,"This is a wonderful ""what if""-drama. Intelligent script, with no plot holes.But, it somewhat fails on the characters: To quote the classics: ""What's my motivation?!!"" I thought the anger of the Motorcycle Professor and the religious Professor was strange and a tat unconvincing. Why would they be MAD at him? Why soooo mad? Remember, this was before he said he was Jesus. Irritated, yes, but so mad? In other words: ""What was their motivation?"" Odd. If a good friend, whose behaviour always has been perfectly nice and normal, suddenly starts making preposterous but otherwise harmless claims, the proper reaction isn't anger, but mere wonderment, worry and maybe irritation. But this anger? That was exaggerated. Maybe it's more convincing in the book, I do hope so.Another thing seemingly 'wrong' with it could have been the lack of curiosity in the group in general, but on second thought Bixby actually covered that nicely. Question remains, whether John could not have foreseen that revealing himself to his son, would cause a heart attack? Or was that a mercy killing?Of course, this is called Sci-Fi for lack of a better and handier label upon which to sell this film. It isn't really Sci-Fi, not even by the broadest definition. It's Fantasy, maybe even science fantasy, or Science Speculation. Or Futuristic Drama, although, with it's focus on the past, that seems a wrong label too. It's definitely of the same ilk as K-Pax, and it's in line with the old philosophical idea of: How would you know if you were talking to a person or a super intelligent computer, if you could never see the one you were talking to? Or with the notion that nothing can be proved for certain, only with a great amount of likelihood.It's rather sad, but also a support of of sorts, to notice that the ALL the negative-hater comments obsess about one of the following two things, or both: [1] The so called bad SOUNDtrack (yes, I'm serious!) I mean, WHAT DA F... is that, right?[2] The films' perceived attack on religion.It doesn't actually attack religion, but American Christianity is so insecure these days, that even the slightest remarks will be perceived as an all out, conspiratorial attack on religion!! ;)This extremely shallow level of criticism is yet another indication that this is a quality film.",The Man from Earth

If the trailer has not one interesting moment in it I think I can assure you the whole film won't be any better. A bunch of no-name actors, a lot of talking and some bad action in a living room. The music is cheesy, the concept is boring and the lighting and direction are way below par. I am not a big fan of low budget, and when I say that I don't mean the amount of money spent, some really great films were done on the cheap, but this is just not one of them. I need to give this a really bad rating to counter act the obvious friend of the director posts calling this the ""must see"" and greatest of all time and giving it ten stars? Really? Ten stars?

The film had multiple interesting ideas, and the script executed these ideas brilliantly.The real issues with this film are its technical aspects. First of all, the cast is close to abysmal, as is the camera-work and quality of the imaging. As the cherry on top, the score sounded like a cheap soap opera.In spite of all of these technical shortcomings, the screenplay by itself adjusts for these. As such, ""The Man from Earth"" to me stands as an example that a film can be great in spite of a low budget and even bad actors - as long as the screenplay is interesting and believable.Highly recommended.",The Man from Earth

It will make all you avid coast-to-coast AM fans feel intelligent and erudite. A clever idea turned into an ideological monstrosity on film. It gives you such a wonderful feeling to redefine and reinterpret everything according to your own crackpot fantasies about human origins, the big religious cover-up of who Jesus ""really"" was (funny how these ""enlightened"" versions always end up making Jesus irrelevant to reality and one among many religious fantasy options for those who need a crutch to get through life), validating the writer/director's own religious preferences (in this case Buddhism), and caricaturing anyone who holds views consistent with recorded history as a narrow-minded, reactionary old poop.

68,bgaiv,Should have taken the professors' advice,6,8 July 2020,"It's remarkably gripping for what's practically a filmed play. And rarely do you see this sort of brainy type conversation. Plus, as a long Trekker, I loved all the Star Trek actors, and it was nice to see William Katt as well.But, this stumbles so badly if you know anything about what they're discussing. These are college professors, and several times they say they want to proofread John's (supposed) sci-fi story so they could catch errors in their speciality that he was bound to make.If only the film production had followed this advice.1) Columbus didn't set sail to prove the Earth was spherical, he was trying to find a shorter route to India. It's been known since far before Columbus's time the Earth is a spheroid.2) Edith is supposed to be a Christian professor, yet she can't offer any defense other than that they're hurting her feelings. I'm not a believer, but I could have done an infinitely better job than her.3) None of the other professors seem to be able to critique this either. Billingsley's character explicitly says he was brought up on the Torah, yet he can offer nothing insightful along these lines.4) And related to that, John's assertion that Christianity is a distorted form of Buddhism is ridiculous. There's quite a massive difference between the two. This doesn't necessarily disprove John was lying and that his teachings (as Jesus) were twisted, but SOMEBODY should have raised this objection.It's frustrating because it started out so well (except the early flat Earth thing) but gets really goofy when they get into religion. I would say Mr Bixby didn't understand much about the religions he was writing about, and it shows. And it all could have been avoided by having experts look at it.Obviously we're meant to believe John is telling the truth, but he gets so much so badly wrong, the correct assumption is he made most of this up and that it is indeed an elaborate joke!From a broader movie standpoint, I think literally making John Jesus was a misstep. It's goes against most of what he was saying earlier, that he's just one small guy. Also, while this is sci-fi, the claims that he slowed down his metabolism to appear dead for the crucifixion just seemed so very different from his other claims. It made it seem to shift into a different genre, very late in the movie.Also, if he has the ability to slow his metabolism such that he appears dead, then why doesn't he demonstrate that?The acting was great! William Katt was especially great, as were Billingsley and Todd, and it was very nice seeing them out of makeup, especially Todd.",The Man from Earth
69,widescreenguy,all the elements of great science fiction,8,15 September 2009,"movie watchers today for some reason go for special effects and explosions and razzle dazzle. followed by advertising budgets more than other films production. all of which can easily mask a rehashed same-old same-old with lots of technology. not so this story. the tension builds gradually at first, in an innocuous enough manner, and then the lead characters drops the bombshell. I look for realism in a story, even sci-fi like this. It is my opinion that the explanations and statements made by the characters are the kind of exchange that would happen in this situation. that he has only vague recollection of his becoming aware he was special, and historic events, and the fact it is impossible for him to ever 'catch up' to all the knowledge of the contemporary times. inevitably the film paints itself into a corner a little bit here and there, but it's called 'suspension of disbelief', considering the subject of the film. so if you can get past that you are in for a remarkable and unique and most entertaining story. the high marks on IMDb are well earned.",The Man from Earth

The story is told my a Man who claims to be 14000 yrs old since the age of cavemen (cro mag-nun). The discussion come from his friends on the day of his leaving, all are friends from his place of work, a local college. As he reveals more the scholars question him and get perfect answers in reply. This is the premise of the film. The premise is a good one but lacking great film making skills. The characters are stereotypical of there field of speciality. The psychologist looks like a smoke piping psychologist e.t.c. This i believe would be to detract the viewer from doing anything other than follow the narrative and discussion. The problem is i found myself paying too much attention to the fact that they were so wooden and stereotypical. They each could only talk about there particular stereotype. i.e the historian mainly discussed the historical facts. The acting therefore became a bit wooden. The exception being the storyteller who expressed subtly the pain of living and leaving and therefore always being alone. The music was not great either and that could have made it a more emotional event. The feeling of time was lacking also, You felt as though the film was in real time but i am sure it was over a course of 5 or 6 hours due to the events around the film but the narrative did not show this to be true. A bigger budget and a better director would have maybe dealt with these issues. Having said that for the budget and resources it was a good effort. Its the story and concept that makes the film good although i think i would have preferred to read it in book form. I don't believe it makes a great film, maybe it could with a bit of tweaking, maybe not !!!!!",The Man from Earth

And for some, that will be a deal breaker, from the really bad sound stage to the hammy acting, the sudden script change, and the odd repeat in dialog.For others like myself hopelessly in love with the concept of 'entirely shot in a single room' and low-fi fantasy, this movie will be a godsend.After rewatching it thought, it became clear this wasn't a 9 or a 10 .

These are just thoughts right after seeing the movie.But the ultimate insult is it didnt seem believable. Not for a second. And it was presented a nice premise with no real scientific scrutiny.Lastly, this is a theme that has been done over and over.

A lot of the dialogue is terribly corny and over-the-top, and there are so many holes in the basic premise that it is frustrating to watch. How come no time in the last hundred years had he investigated the biological condition that makes him immortal? Surely sometime in the last 14000 years he would have been in a freak accident that would have left him permanently injured or killed (the odds of being stepped on by a mammoth for example must surely add up over the centuries). Why does nobody ask about the biological side of things - one of these guys is even a biologist but he doesn't seem particularly concerned about any of that. If he can not scar, then surely this provides an easy mechanism for them to test his story - just cut his arm and see how it looks in a few weeks - similarly he could have tested this out with the other immortal person he claimed to have met. Perhaps the worst mistake of all is making the psychologist fellow his son. (I'm not sure if this is actually what was implied but I'm sure as hell not going back to double check). The psychologist would have surely recognised his father from photographs, why would John talk about his previous identity so casually knowing that he might overhear - and why, despite his experience and knowledge is he unable to save him from the heart attack.

He's an immortal! But he doesn't look a day over thirty-five. Should we believe him? It's a dilemma. So, just pull up a chair, pour a glass of your favorite spirit and enjoy some good conversation. This film had me engrossed from the start. I watched it between 4:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m.--and there was no chance of me falling off into a deep slumber. The movie touches on all the hot button subjects of the day: religion, science, life, death, politics, an entire raft of radioactive issues for your contemplation. I can see how some people of faith may find this to be offensive and an awful exercise in movie-making. Others among us may find it slow and lacking in action. I didn't. The action is in John's words. His story is all one should need to sustain interest. And for me, anyway, I was enthralled by his answers to the others' probing questions. Nothing was pat. You may not like what he has to say, but, unlike many modern films, he is given the freedom and the time to say them. If you have an open mind for such material then this is the film for you.

The other 10% is standing in the parking area talking. The group discussion is interesting but after 45 minutes I started to get bored. This movie is above average but, if you are looking for excitement, this is not the flick. I suppose it is somewhat intellectually stimulating to think of a guy that lived for 15,000 years, but only for a brief party charade. Someone needs to explain to me why this is a ""thinking person's sci-fi movie."" I just didn't see anything particularly profound or thought-provoking in the content of this movie. The story is enough to carry the movie for about 45 minutes but after that it becomes tiresome. The end is anti-climatic.

It had a lot going for it and what it lacked in commercial qualities was more then made up for with a thoughtful story and good characters. This is what thinking scifi should be like and not concentrate on blowing things up, but then again this isn't that kind of film..From the moment ""John"" posed his question to the last scene I was wrapped, so much that I watched the film in one sitting.Now I did mention a spoiler so here you are so be warned.* * * *I did find one character's reaction in the film surprising. The lady Edith seemed to get quite enraged when ""John"" mentions that he could have been Jesus, and while it's understandable and it seems at one point her head is going to explode. Wonderful acting on the part of the lady that played her..What surprised me was both her intolerance to this idea and at the same time her ease at letting it all go when ""John"" capitulated having seen that his story had gone too far and was upsetting all in the room. When he finally does call it quits everyone feels both relieved and frustrated and as they were all leaving Edith forgives him and that was the second bit of her role that surprised me..I won't say any more because to do so would spoil the film more then I have already but I think you should go out and see this for yourself and make up your own mind.

Man From Earth deserves far more than that. The movie is one of the most deep and unbiased analyzes ever made deconstructing religion and human myths in less than 90 minutes. Simple, objective, real, and humane, the film touches an universal subject with profound respect and subtlety.The greatest catch is understanding all historical facts and relate them as simply as possible to the fall of all previous myths and empires worldwide. The connection is Jesus Cron-Magnum. A mortal man who's been alive for 140 centuries and is getting older, 35 years in his life time today. The possibilities are groundbreaking as far as explaining ourselves to ourselves.Personally, I can't see a better definition for agnostic: a person who believes in all mysteries but realizes truth is one also. A moving, intellectual, and bonding experience that could be compared with some of the greatest films of all times, Bergman's Seventh Seal, Tarkovski's Stalker, Kieslovski's Decalogue, and Kurosawa's Rashomon or Derzu Uzala. Man from Earth, perhaps, is one of the most important films ever made and should create positive instigative discussions among people of good faith from all backgrounds.",The Man from Earth

You would think that a 14,000-yo man would at least present some convincing evidence for his claims : how many languages would you learn in that time span ? How many mathematical equations would you have solved ? How accurate would you be in so many ways ? What kind of mastery of your body would you have obtained with the teachings of the Buddha ? Being a historical witness of Sumerian maths, how great would it be for you to help scientists understand it ?Well, the writers inevitably had to avoid these questions, because they would have made the whole movie nonsensical. And yet it turned out to be nonsensical anyway. I think the movie would have made sense if the writers had clung to the fact that the protagonist had bad memory and was clumsy, because the Buddha/Jesus/genius-graduate twist just made that idea nonsensical.",The Man from Earth
94,idonotexist,The man from what did i just watch,1,17 July 2009,"This is not an action movie, true. The acting is borderline terrible, which is also tolerable since technically the cast is supposed to take it all as a joke.However what is not tolerable is the rambling about nothing for the entire duration of the film. This isn't historically interesting, neither is it factual, neither is it literally digestible. This is nothing more than your average Monday morning coffee house chat altar boys (it's on the same level - junior high at most) have about what they have just heard over the weekend in Sunday school.I was utterly disappointed to discover this movie was a mascaraded Jesus movie executed in a bad fashion. It has nothing beyond the tag line (which is never developed mind you) to keep your attention and it is clearly made for a specific audience, but advertised to all in the hopes that people will not realize what a pile of crook it is an still watch it. One needs no more than 3 minutes to realize this caters only to confused religious people who are so wrapped up in their way they grasp at every strand of non bible verse to look outside the box.To everybody else, this is an insult. The script is an insult to logic, to history, to facts, to science, and certainly to religion itself really. The ONLY niche that will be impressed (as can be seen by the scores and volumes of forum posts) is that little confused religious group that isn't quite sure if their religion is real or not. Well folks, let me save you the time; you won't find the answer here. The man from earth should take heed to its name and be buried in the cinematic graveyard where it belongs.It will pose no questions past the high school level, offer no answers and leave your totally hanging asking ""i want my 40000 years back"".

It is a perfect one in every aspects. usually, I don't like movies that are almost fully filmed in one location but this one is an exception. Immediately after the initial introducing of the characters the story moves to the ""edge of the seat"" level which is completely unusual for a movie without any action scenes (usually this kind of movies are slow). More importantly, it keeps it that way until the very end.The story is a belief challenging mystery-drama. Regardless of being categorized as science fiction, I disagree with any emphasis on this classification. The story is mainly about human believes and associated fragile bases of them in the mind. Regardless if you are a faith person or not, I guarantee you will enjoy this one. This is in fact its most strong characteristic. Acting is brilliant where people are well fitted in their character. There are also several plot twists in the movie which makes it even more interesting.I Recommend this movie to everyone. It will make a very unique experience.",The Man from Earth

Tony Toddan actor who normally couldn't out-act William Shatnerwas fantastic, as was David Lee Smith, an actor whom I'm barely aware of. As I said, it's filmed as a yak, yak stage play, with no profanity, no gore, no horror, yet it plays as the most entertaining movie I've seen sincemaybe all year!The story was so engaging that I was completely enthralled by the tale. I will give no spoilers at all, except to say it's the story of a manhe claims to be 14000 years old, told to a group his academic peers.

Ann Rice's Interview with a vampire and the Swedish movie and book ""Let the right one in."" Both excellent films. Even Highlander falls into this category. Yet films approaches the story in an semi unique way (its a little similar to Ann Rice's original book). The differences are great enough to make this movie its own. In positive ways.This movie see's a Stamford professor, moving from his job, to parts unknown. His life appears to be perfect where he lives, that the people around him really want to know why is he leaving? What could be pulling him away from a good life. So he decides, to tell everyone his story and its a fascinating one. These kinds of movies can really be hit or miss. Which I find to be very true of the genre. The tone was so calm, everyone so collective. I felt I was sitting around listening to the story alongside the other caste.Ofcourse with films like this sometimes it's easy to be dissapointed not to see flashbacks or hear more detail. But alas how much of 12,000 years can you fit into 90 mins. Not much. This movie created 90s mins of gold. I'm going to give this film a 10/10 because it done so well at portraying an excellent story in a difficult centre. Also the actors and actresses need to be commeneded. Their work was very good.

I did care if the other characters thought it was true, but the answer was pretty obvious from the beginning. Not much thought was put into the characters and I never really got to know them.The worst thing about this movie is the acting. It's all completely emotionless and it looks like they're reading everything off a teleprompter or citing the lines in there heads. On a side-note, I don't know if this was just a problem with the DVD but the voices sounded like voice-overs. Like the sounds weren't really coming out of their mouths in real-time.Lastly, it was WAY too serious. I love movies like this, people discussing something in one simple room.

The movie went out in 2007 yet everything feels old and dated. The clothes, the image quality, it feels like an 80's movie. I think they could have chosen a better place to shoot it than this awful small house, something more conducive to the mood. I know the story itself was written a while back and maybe it's an homage to have such antiquated decor, but I don't think it's a good thing.Also, some twists feel a bit too out of place. The Jesus thing I can accept it, it's not perfectly set up, but it leads to interesting debate. However the very end with his ""son"" I could have lived without. It's a bit too much, but I guess they didn't want to mess with Jerome Bixby's story.So all in all it's a nice intellectual exercise, but I'm not sure it deserves the ""cult sci-fi movie"" tag everybody seems to apply to it.

Ancient Greeks had actually calculated, with surprising accuracy, the circumference of the earth According to historian Jeffrey Burton Russell, ""no educated person in the history of Western Civilization from the third century B.C. onward believed that the Earth was flat.""2) The body does not renew/replace all its cells every 7 years. That is a myth and a misconception. Although its true that the lining of the stomach is renewed every few days, other parts can take a decade or more to renew and some parts stay with us from birth to death.3) There are not different versions of the Bible. This is another misconception. There are, however, many different translations, which is different. For example, if you ask two experts to translate a Greek passage (without conferring with one another) you'll get two unique translations, but they'll both mirror the original Greek passage.This could have been an interesting film, but early on I could not suspend my disbelief and the only way to view this film is from the perspective that it takes place in an alternate universe where our knowledge and facts don't exist.

I gave it a very low rating because it insulted my intelligence.Sad that in this day and age a movie can be written that is so offensive to those who seek truth and knowledge and yet pleases the ignorant masses.
Sometimes I feel we are living in the dark ages.The story is of a man who says he's thousands of years old, yet he doesn't seem to recall any wives or children over all this time and his account of history is so totally distorted that it's laughable.He admits at the end that he lied, but we're left to wonder when he implies he's one of the men's grandfather. That could have been believable in a Twilight Zone type of mentality, but the rest is such nonsense.I won't go into the Biblical inaccuracies, but none of his recollection of that era is accurate with Roman records or any other historical books on the subject.I was intrigued at first because it seemed like an updated copy of a Twilight Zone episode ""Long Live Walter Jameson."" Sadly it pales in comparison. At least the writers for that show made the character believable. This movie puts the idea to shame.As I said, I was intrigued at first, but later on it got so silly that I could barely contain my laughter.

There are no special effects, there is no pacing, no plot points, and very little of the emotional development you find in most modern movies.This is classic sci fi in the sense it is the type of stuff that was written back in the days when any book with a rocket ship on the cover would sell 10,000 copies. I grew up reading this stuff. And I would guess that the 11,000 rating votes this movie has garnered so far (with an amazing 8.3 star average) were from people who grew up reading this stuff, too.Its biases are deep, but subtle. It appears to have explored every corner of human existence, and to be open, skeptical and forthrightly honest – to an almost ferocious degree – about the human condition.But this kind of thinking never explores the corner itself, or the walls, or the context of the human situation. It never says, What am I? in a profound, ontological way. What I am, what you are, to these 1950's classicists, is a rational, autonomous individual with certain wants and needs. Oh, sweet mystery of life – there is none. What is given is rationality, is want, is need, and nothing beyond that. You're a 1950's agnostic and you've lived 14,000 years and you're still an agnostic, still cramped within this bittersweet ache of the apparent meaninglessness of life.I love the old-time sci fi writers, Asimov, Bradbury, Sterling, et al; they were my spiritual and intellectual fathers. But they only go so far down the path. And they have curious blind spots. I mean, really, 14,000 years, and you're still in the 1950's?",The Man from Earth
113,mronrox45,Your idological atheist college professors will love it,1,19 October 2011,"I gave this film two out of ten because the first 45 minutes were compelling. However, when he claims to be Jesus from teachings of Buddha it really stating turning me off. Although Im a Christian I do appreciate a good debate about historical facts but this movie had none! Hollywood seems to go through phases where certain genres are popular and different subjects are frowned upon but the Christian bashing has just gotten tired. Its to the point where I don't think its a genre anymore, but rather an ideology. From the proclamation of being Jesus this became a ritual in proving He was no more than a simple everyday man who said a few things that the Church later turned into a religion. It eerily reminded me of ""The Da Vinci code"" in that everything is a conspiracy to make us all feel like pawns in the Church/Governments worldwide control, another tired genre. What really bothered me is how much this movie comes off like a documentary, when its nothing more than a fantasy, filled with as many ""theories"" about how the real Jesus was not real. Not to mention the only ""villian"" (if there could be one) is the Christian lady. Whos only fault is thinking this guys story could not be true and he could not be Jesus....what a nut! Like I said in the memo, this movie is an ideological atheist college teachers favorite movie. I wont name them (Georgia Tech), but I guarantee they are the bulk of the ""8 out of 10"" stars this movie got in IMDb. Know-it-all teenagers and adult children who live in the basement and probably the rest are at the ""occupy wall street"" movement will get a kick out of this movie.

After seeing the film, I'd liken it a bit to the ""What the bleep do we know"" films, as it covers similar ground, albeit from a different perspective. The actors did a pretty good job and the music set the tone quite well. Not sure where the previous commenter got the millions of dollars to produce figure, as it was all shot in a single location, or room for the matter, and there wasn't anything that would have cost near that figure within the film.Anyway, if you want a thought provoking film that you can enjoy, see again at a later date and still enjoy it, check it out.

In my opinion this movie is not just something for people who have the rationality to hear other perspectives. I actually hope especially people who are fixed on their strong belief to take a look on this movie, because it also teaches us the true meaning of how we should ""believe"". Jerome Bixby did a very good job in executing his idea. The story began with curiosity and it lead to even more curiosity. Usually I expect the visuals to tell the story. But in this movie the visual storytelling didn't have that much of a relevance with the exception of the details. The movie was still captivating the spectator with the very realistic and pleasant dialogues. Also the simple characters make it possible for everyone to watch the movie. And these roles were filled with delightful performances, especially David Lee Smith and Tony Todd made it so easy to understand the characters. I hope those who still didn't watch the movie will give it a try. Because of the simple execution and because of less visuals as well it may be not the type of movie for everybody.

Just like the characters in the movie who listen to 1 guy telling a story about his life and how he wandered around earth thru the last 14 millennia. The intellectual conversations throughout the movies are a bit shallow and lack substance and to some extend plausibility but it's compensated by a clear train of thought from point a to b always embedded in the ambiguity whether the characters believe him or not. Some interesting concepts and ideas around religion and scientific methods are used as motifs. Also they found a neat way to make sure that the characters could neither proof or disprove the story, which kept this superposition of truth and lie going shortly before the ending.Spoilers ahead ------------ And with the ending I would see the biggest problem with the movie - unfortunately they chose to go for one that tries to tie up some loose ends instead of keeping everybody guessing. Oldman could have walked away and leave it up to everybody else what they take away from it. The fact that one of the other characters turns out to be his son was an absolutely unnecessary twist and to a degree, invalidated the bottom line of the movie, which could have been that everybody chooses by himself what to believe.",The Man from Earth
121,World-viewer,Admit it.. you find the premise intriguing!,10,18 April 2020,"This is what movie making is all about. A simple premise, yet one with deep ramifications and implications for all involved, if not society in general. This is not exactly a spoiler, since if you are reading this review and have read its summary blurb, you pretty know that the movie is about a professor who reveals he is, well, quite old. Very old.Let's not kid ourselves. We've all been there. Imagining how things must have been before the advent of the video camera, or even regular cameras. Reading history books and visualizing the stories, the battles, the discussions in our heads. You would not be normal if you did not wonder how things actually were so many years ago. And more profoundly, how did we, as relatives of cave-dwelling pre-historic hominids, go from there to living in concrete jungles, typing up reviews on things called computers. If a person could shed some light on that, some first hand light, would you not find that interesting?The basic premise of the movie is quite simple. A man who does not age. No matter what you think we know about the human body, most of the body's functions remain a mystery. Read the information pamphlet that comes with Tylenol, and after a hash about technical formulas of the compound, other esoteric chemical and medical details and disclaimers about use, you get a small blurb ""The exact mechanism of action of acetaminophen is not known"". Wow. So much for that. We are just at the tip of our knowledge of genetics and medicine in general. This is what gives the premise of the movie a somewhat rational plausibility, and as a consequence, if you think about it, moves you to a jolting realization. If such a person, one among a billions, were plausible, having the ability to heal and not age, what would it mean for mankind?The movie is set as a discussion among a few characters. It is not an action, relationship, romance kind of movie. It exists to slap your preconceived biases in the face, sit you down, and then sets out to answer some of the aforementioned questions in a very intellectual and rational way, tackling issues of faith, spirituality and other core aspects about our very nature.it is a highly rewarding journey into areas we don't think about often, heightening our self-awareness, but also exposing our vulnerabilities, both individual and societal, and our dependency on beliefs and structure. In short, it is a movie to really make you think.If you enjoy debating new ideas, thinking about the world, I can think of very few movies you are going to enjoy more, especially with friends, a bottle of scotch and with a nice fire going, that this one. Hate it, or love it, an invigorating discussion will likely follow and you will come out of the whole experience a wiser person.Highly recommend this movie. And it's sequel.",The Man from Earth
122,jeffpk,"An interesting ""Small movie""",8,24 December 2010,"With about a half dozen actors/actresses and all shot inside and outside a little cottage, this is an interesting and thoughtful movie.If ""science fiction"" to you means spaceship dogfights and laser-swords (which is more properly ""science fantasy"") then you won't get this film. This is a film about ideas, one main one, and the impact that discovering something that breaks all your deepest held beliefs has on people. We the audience, just like the characters in the film, are caught in the grip of a tale that seems too challenging to be true.. and too wonderful to *not* be real.The writing and acting is top notch and makes this movie, which could have easily been a stage play, gripping throughout. It has a small twist to its ending... just enough to surprise and delight the viewer and put a nice ""cap"" on this very thoughtful musing.I should add that this film was well researched, including many current historical theories and melding them together into one compelling narrative. If you get bored in movies without fast cuts and things blowing up, again, this movie isn't for you. But if you like to play with ideas and are a student of human behavior, don't miss a chance to see it.Afterword: In an ironic twist to a movie about what happens when people's cherished or well held belies are challenged, reading many of the negative reviews here will show you exactly what the movie is exploring in real life.",The Man from Earth
123,Saw-it-on-Tubi,"One shocking twist too many, pick one",3,1 March 2019,"The film begins with several college professors from different departments, and for reasons I am still not sure of, a young coed, gathering to say goodbye to an old colleague who is abruptly moving away. The action of this film takes place inside one room of a man's house. Within 20 minutes, I thought this would make a great stage adaptation and was somewhat surprised to learn that it wasn't originally. The isolated location practically screams for the stage in the style of 12 Angry Men, but sadly this is the only comparison that can be made between the two films.To avoid spoilers, I will be intentionally vague for the remainder of this review. About halfway to two-thirds into the production, the conversation goes into a really weird direction that is obviously designed to be polarizing. I tend to be of the opinion that if you have to shock an audience in that way, your story is not holding its weight. What I am sure is meant to be an emotional philosophical discussion ends up sounding like every pseudo-intellectual conversation I have heard at a college professor's gathering, which frankly makes sense given the setting.But what makes that detour all the more upsetting is another reveal in the last few moments of the film. In my view, this last revelation had the potential to be the more satisfying, heartbreaking, and impactful of the film's story points, but it feels tacked onto the end and gets overshadowed by the earlier detour. It had the potential to explore the idea of the human condition and touch on loss, attachment, and time, but it goes for the earlier polarizing twist. In the end, the character the last reveal impacts is almost not needed, simply put in place to confirm the presented story. Indeed, you may leave this experience think, what is the point?",The Man from Earth
124,collings500,Filmmakers Beware,3,25 July 2021,"The problem with this movie is not just the endless, ho-hum, high school level philosophical chit-chat - this is the entire move, actually - it's the fact that none of the supporting players ever react in a normal, believable manner to the main character's whacko revelations. Their comments run the gamut from nervous joking, to cautious disbelief, to serious inquiry - all in a painfully squeezed time-frame. (The ""action"" is confined to one location and takes place in a single talk-talk-talk evening.) If this isn't phony enough, we get to see the reaction shots in lots of ""filler"" close-ups and every image looks painfully contrived and B-movie fake. Imagine your own reaction if one of your friends - who looks like a stock player from a TV soap opera - told you at a party that he was really some 14,000 year old immortal (or whatever) who had survived all the historical diseases (including the Black Plague), travelled worldwide for hundreds of years with no apparent means of support (or means of travel, for that matter), studied with the Buddha, known Van Gogh (he still has the painting), and - oh yeah - also happened to be Jesus...Note to aspiring filmmakers everywhere: no matter how earnest your vision may be, your audience still has to WATCH it.",The Man from Earth

Almost entirely shot in one setting, this film about a conversation is better, in my opinion, than My Dinner With Andre (one of my favorites).I love how Bixby (the writer) makes you think. He gives us a superb ""What If"" and thrusts us into John Oldman's lifelong enigma, a burden he has carried for a very, very long time. How would you handle his problem? This delightful conversation sucks the viewer in and won't let go until you see how the protagonist resolves his problem. This is a film that makes you think and wonder about other possibilities. For that, I remain deeply grateful to Bixby for taking on the challenge. For my fellow Christians, I only hope they have the patience and bravery to consider that there may be things even they don't know for certain. After all, both scientists and the faithful need to remain humble to the Truth, whatever that truth turns out to be.And today, I just saw the sequel. I gave the original 10 stars; the sequel only 2.

When I watched it I wasn't aware that it cane from the pen of a Star Trek and Twilight Zone writer, but it's quite obvious. This could be a stage play; certainly a radio play. There are no special effects! None! Yet we are transported across millennia - simply by conversation, and a believable cast of characters. While these people are sketches, that's all they need to be: the tale is the thing that they serve. I thought this was great: it reminded me of K-Pax a bit.

128,delibebek,"Good premise, mediocre execution",6,20 August 2010,"This movie is worth watching for the way it demonstrates what effort it takes to make a truly good screen play. The idea here is intriguing and even the sparse setting is workable, but the scripting is a series of leaps in thought - contrivances of conversation serving the screenwriter in his attempt to bring out certain points within his idea.John Oldman claims to have been alive for about 14,000 years, a fact which he has pieced together in part thanks to modern findings which help him date his origins. He reveals this to his friends on the day they are helping him move out of his home, in his usual pattern of leaving town before people realize he never ages. The idea has such potential, but it seems thrown into a movie and not thought very well in terms of the actual script.Firstly, John's stammering reveal of his situation doesn't show any of the experience of someone who has been moving on every 10 years for over a dozen millennia. He knows why he is moving on, and yet he isn't prepared to cover it with a simple believable story. With his experience, he shouldn't even have to cover it. He should have developed ways to move from one town to another without the slightest suspicion about his leaving. But this is the idea that winds through the whole script.Secondly, none of the reactions were handled credibly, not in the words of the characters and not in the portrayals by the actors. When someone begins to tell you that he's been alive for 14,000 years, it will take more than an afternoon of chatting about it to convince an educated person, which all of these characters are, knowing each other through their professorships at a local university.When it comes to the reveal inside this tale, it's a wonder anyone is still taking him seriously, and yet they do. It's clear this was an attempt by the writer to get the viewer to take the tale seriously as well, but it doesn't carry. We're left thinking the professors are a bunch of idiots.Overall, the characters are too constructed, and the script too perfunctory for such a novel idea. The concept is worth a rework.",The Man from Earth

131,reid-hawk,Flawed movie that could have been a masterpiece.,6,5 April 2016,"Oh what an attempt ""The Man from Earth"" makes at being a low budget deep thinker hit. This movie is solid, there's no doubt about that. The premise of characters sitting around and talking about more interesting events for the better part of an hour and a half might sound boring, but on screen it is beautiful. The score perfectly matches the theme and tone of each section of our famous traveler's increasingly strange tale without ever coming across as cheesy or unnecessary. When discussion and arguments between characters breaks out, the score goes away and lets the actors take over on screen; and for the most part, the actors do a pretty good job. Sometimes dialogue comes off as cringe worthy or cheesy, but that seems to be more of a result of a flawed script than a issue with the actors themselves. But overall this movie and the story it weaves is original and thought provoking, so much so that it feels like it has the depth of a full length novel compacted into over an hour of screen time.So where do the problems begin? Well for me they're immediate. I understand that this is a lowest of low budget kind of movie, and its more about what is being told by the characters rather than shown on screen, but the lighting and camera quality are terrible. Every close up shot looks grainy, and the obviousness of the studio lighting is annoying. Another issue comes from an early factual error. Not spoiling anything, but our characters tell of how Columbus showed everyone that the world isn't flat. Yeah, that's not true... at all. I mean there was a reason in Greek mythology why the titan Atlas was holding up a spherical world rather than a flat map... I mean out of your whole movie about life from the beginning how do you screw up the one story that is most famous and well-known? Oh and lets not forget melodrama, cause we can't make a movie without a character at least once pulling out a gun to threaten someone and then to threaten their own suicide. Like really, was this necessary? Cause after it happens the whole situation is pretty much discarded and never really addressed. It was basically pointless drama for the sake of drama. Here's my biggest nitpick I have (less of a full fledged issue and more of a personal annoyance): why is the Christian lady portrayed as the most stereotypical Christian alive? Seriously that's pretty weak. Out of all your characters why did you have to cop out and make the religious woman the most whiny, easily irritated character who throws out the terms ""blasphemous"" and ""sacrilege"" like a pedophile throws out candy? It's just weak and basic way to write a character in a story filled with complex characters. Overall this movie is: unique, original, somewhat flawed, and definitely above average (I consider a 6 average BTW because I'm bad at rating on a number scale. Just a little fun fact about Reid Hawkins that you can discuss in your fan club meetings) so this movie gets a 7.5/10.",The Man from Earth
132,michael@piston.net,"Talky, tedious, implausible, uninteresting",2,4 January 2008,"For a movie that is virtually nothing but talk, the Man From Earth has remarkably little to say of novelty and intelligence. What it does say has been said many times before, much better, and certainly without the hokey premise. The movie begins with a handsome middle aged professor mysteriously announcing that he is leaving his university for points unknown. When pressed, he announces that the reason is because he is 14,000 years old and never ages. Therefore he must uproot himself every 10 years to avoid detection. The rest of the movie involves his friends pressing him for details of his life, which grow more juvenilishly implausible as time goes by. It is one thing to accept the possibility that an individual exists who has lived 14,000 years without aging. It is quite another to accept that he just ""happened"" to meet, and become friends with, every historical celebrity any of his friends mention in their questioning, from well-known figures in their time as Buddha and Hammurabi, to the completely unknown (in his lifetime) Vincent Van Gogh, who just happened to be his neighbor in 19th century Europe. Right. Nor is it plausible that a person who learned to speak English as an adult would now speak perfect unaccented American English, or that he not only appears, but acts no different than any of his peers. Certainly all of us are aware that people who are older do not only look different, but also act different, with mannerisms, clothing and speech patterns that are noticeably distinguishable from persons just 2 decades younger. How likely is that a 14,000 year old man will look and sound just like a contemporary middle aged man? In short, it is absurd to believe that any intelligent person would have thought that the protagonist's tall tale was anything more than a not particularly clever hoax, which is why I couldn't care less when he finally made his absurd claims regarding his real identity, and offered as revelation the same hackneyed ideas about Judeo-Christianity that are routinely posted by precocious 12 year olds on internet forums.",The Man from Earth

There is so much to praise it's hard to put it into words, so I will suffice to saying the screenplay was one of the best and most thought on I have ever seen (one could see why it took thirty-eight years to finish).Now, on to the criticism. I honestly couldn't cope with the religious parts. If we accept this movie as a work science fiction all is well. But if Jerome Bixby expects people to change their religious views while watching this, then we have a serious problem. Seeing how Bixby is a skilled writer (this movie alone is proof enough of this) he has invented a new effective way of conveying one's idea, no matter how absurd, to others.
Below is a possible 'conversation' that went on in the writer's head.""Ok. So how do I elevate Buddha in the minds of those who see this movie while slamming Christianity and denying God without giving any actual reasons and support to these claims? Got it! I'll make a fictional immortal man who has lived 14000 years. Then I'll elevate him in the mind of my viewers and make them trust him throughout the movie. Thus whatever he says will be immediately taken for granted because coming from the tongue of such a person anything I choose to express, no matter how unauthentic, will be a memory, not a claim!
So first I'll have him say how amazing a person Buddha was and how much he learned from him. Then I'll make him say that Moses was merely a myth, without giving any reasons and proof. After that I'll make him Jesus and undermine Christianity by making him mention that all he originally intended was to revive Buddha's teachings! Of course this is my personal opinion and I have no defense for it, but because of the context in which I present it, my viewers will accept it. And just to be sure I'll make Jesus an atheist!! And in case that isn't enough I'll also add a character who is a devoted Christian and show her as a weak, thoughtless person from the start. So when my immortal starts destroying Christianity she can cry by the side, showing the utter weakness of religious people and their inability to defend their beliefs!""Just for the record by rewriting this story and adding and subtracting a few lines of dialogue one can completely alter history to their own will in a way people will be inclined to accept.

It brings up some interesting points among them the fact that just because he's been alive that long wouldn't make him more intelligent or advanced than most people. It touches on the question of if he's immortal and can't die or just hasn't aged, all the while his friends and the viewers are left to wonder if he's serious, playing a joke or perhaps mentally ill.Quickly though the movie really goes awry, even someone who has lived 14,000 years wouldn't necessarily have met any famous people who have lived in that time much less as many as he has met and once he claimed he was the man we now refer to as Jesus it just got so bogged down, pretentious and ridiculous.

So although I was initially intrigued by the unfolding of events in this movie, I eventually felt only disgust when I realized the multi-faceted implications of what they were stupidly suggesting...not merely smearing the ancestral origins of Jesus but venturing way beyond that to attack His teachings. Whereas modern Christianity has shifted the emphasis from the religion OF Jesus to a religion ABOUT Jesus, that is still not the same thing as a denial of His identity or a rejection of His words. Upon first hearing the erroneous accusation that Jesus used the term ""Master"" but not ""Father"", the first thing that came to mind was the first two words of The Lord's Prayer that Jesus authored: ""OUR FATHER"". The character of John Oldman never really offers any contemporary evidence that he was who he claimed to be. In my final take on the film, I realized that the author leaves enough room for personal interpretation (despite some of the unexpected revelations near the end pertaining to John's alleged family connection to Dr. Will Gruber that could have been loosely based on data-mining research) to at least allow a serious consideration of the distinct possibility that John Oldman is indeed certifiably crazy and as a deeply pathological liar, has convinced both himself and his professional associates that these grandiose delusions of divinity-flavored lunacy that have faithfully blossomed with the passing of time in the forever-fragrant garden of his psychotically-fertilized mind are indeed just as verifiably true as a caveman's encounter with pain when he sets his toes on fire to keep them warm.",The Man from Earth
140,vikramsamal,Most Intelligently written movie..,10,28 February 2008,Well this is the best piece of writing in terms of sorry but not as in screenplay that i have come across in a long long time.. The way John tells his story and layers and layers are added to his story just makes up for brilliant watch..Forget all those gadgetry and gimmicky sci-fi movies and watch a movie simply because of his sheer intelligence and thought provocavity.. Well its bound to evoke some anti-Christian thoughts but the people thinking on those lines should appreciate cinema for its liberty of expression and moreover this is a depiction of fiction and should be taken in the same spirit.. And many people will fell it to be boring or not interesting and I can simply put that to their low IQs for to understand and truly appreciate a movie as The Man From Earth you got to be intelligent enough yourself coz a film is as good as its audience...,The Man from Earth
141,Turin_Horse,ALERT! the rate of this film is a SCAM.,1,12 November 2020,"I am pretty sure the 7.9 rate of this film is a scam, there is no other explanation for the abysmal discrepancy between the actual quality of the film and the absurd high rate it holds. The fact that most good reviews rate the film ""10"" is very revealing. Usually you have reasonable proportions of 10, 9, 8, 7... in films that are highly valued by viewers, to get a final score of 7.5 - 8.5. Here we have a suspicious proportion of 10s that strongly suggests something is going on...About the film itself I do not want to waste time on commenting it. Suffice is to say that it is among the 10 worst films I have ever watched. Laughable and ridiculous story and script, executed in the most amateurish way (a bunch of friends rehearsing for half an hour and filming their conversation on a Sunday afternoon would have done much better) and with zero production values to speak of. Even the famous (infamous...) Tommy Wiseau's ""The Room"" is above ""The man from Earth"" in several of the aforementioned points.Who devised and implemented this scam and what for I do not know. Many of the rate 10 comments are actually long and detailed, which points to the whole project in itself being an elaborate scam from the beginning. Hey!, let's film this and make hundreds of good reviews (ravishing most of them) at IMDB, and let's monitor what happens: how many people watch the film, how viewers who do not participate in the scam react and rate the film, etc.So, if you want to participate in the scam watch the film and judge by yourself. You will waste one hour and a half of your life, but then you can come here and give us your opinion.",The Man from Earth
142,geminate7,So Very Boring,5,16 December 2007,"Anyone who actually has graduated college with a serious degree or two would agree that this is one of the most tired and boring films ever made. Remember these are actors, and from what I experienced they probably have a collective IQ of 100. Garbage in garbage out, it is purely a very tall and poor tale of nonsense, based in nothingness. The acting was terrible, we're stuck in a room full of ignorant, arrogant blow-hards for most of the torture. The ending is so bad that it actually killed someone in the film. I sure wished it was I after enduring this astonishingly bad fare. If you have a brain and a higher education please, for your own sake, never see this movie. I swear you will lose major brain cells and walk out losing a substantial amount of intellect, which may never return. If you are an idiot, which must be the majority of those who actually recommend this movie, then do yourself a favor and read a couple thousand books to gain an education so as to be able to know trash from gold.",The Man from Earth
143,hindsiteman,Its like watching someone reading a book,1,20 April 2010,"This is not a movie in my opinion. Movies have plots, and twists. Here the twist is that the old retired professor is in fact Jesus Christ!!! And on top of that, he's been walking side by side with dino's and cavemen!? What is this fecal matter they're trying to sell me? How could you people give this such high grades. It is NOT OUT OF THE BOX! It's just out there, and all over the place, and just like a fertilizer, smells. This movie felt like defecating on everything humans built during entire World history. One major twist in entire movie is...the protagonist, never contemplated about committing suicide, like every other immortal that suffers from seeing his loved ones die from old age. The lack of emotions is so appalling here, it makes you cry! How can you make this movie and not include other emotions than just religious spite?",The Man from Earth
144,pippolomeo,High rates clearly come from not-so-open-minded people..,4,25 June 2020,"Scientology is mentioned once in this movie, and people who rate this movie high (the vast majority, actually) remind me of people with that belief, in some way.I like the idea of making a sci-fi movie only based on dialog; some of the best Star Trek episodes (of which Birxby is actually author) are like this, but this movie is so terribly acted, full of one-liners and random changes, logically shacky and ridicolous at times that if you rate it 10 then you must have some bias about it.The idea of Jesus being basically a philosopher who tried to lead buddhism into western society is not new at all. I am sorry for those who consider the author of this script a genius, but he just reported already existing theories about Jesus.There are many aspects of this movie which are fascinating (probably the best one is that the author revealed the end of the script to his son just before he himself died), but it is so awfully made that it seems more a bad joke that a ""thought-provoking movie for open-minded people"". It's more like a dull movie for people who consider themselves open-minded but they like only stories which tell them what they want to be told, which is in some way exactly what religion is..I can also clearly see links with Star Trek here: sci-fi as a way to provoke the audience which most of times result in a awkward theatre script full of logical holes which make the movie ridicolous at non-Trekkers eyes. At the end of the dialogue with myself I have made in this review, i have probably found the religion followed by people rating this movie high: Star Trek.",The Man from Earth
145,johndoemofo,"An Atheist Wet Dream, Pure Garbage For Those With Half A Brain",1,20 January 2018,"I admit I like a good storytelling, and it started off decent even though some of the acting was bad, but once the main character said he was 14,000 and started talking about historical facts I sat in disbelief at how moronic and historically inaccurate it got.He said he sailed with Columbus, who was scared he'd fall off the earth, being that is was considered flat. Any kid can easily debunk that nonsense. The 'flat earth' and Columbus was a work of science fiction by a famous American writer named Washington Irving.
That quickly escalated into the rest of the film revolving around him claiming the Bible was fake, made up from other religions he knew of beforehand, and that he was Jesus the Christ. Everybody created a myth around him, he was just a simple man trying to teach others what he learned from Buddha...Again anybody doing simple research will know Buddha wasn't born until hundreds of years after Jesus.All of this is the same stupid nonsense atheist talk about, since they never bother to study and just regurgitate stories that fit their ideology.All the 10 stars and rave reviews are probably from one or a small group of militant atheist.Pure and Utter Garbage.

146,AbhiSh4ke,Artform,10,30 November 2020,Straight off the bat many people won't appreciate this movie and that's okay.

I will cherish this movie for a long time. Please watch this.,The Man from Earth
147,snncy2000,Mind provocative or...,6,20 February 2009,"I can easily understand why some people find this amazing. I deeply sorry to see a lot of people who don't give enough thought on religion and live a life wrapped around daily pleasures.These people, let's call them skeptic's, just don't know what to believe but they are also too lazy to find it out. So, they live in sort of ""pagan"" life, don't really care about tough questions like ""where we came from"" or ""what happens after death""..So for those people this movie is like a charm. All the answers they'd love...But if you give it a second thought you'll see many holes in the script and even it'll look silly.The movie suggests Buddhism over Christianity. It quietly passes Islam and Judaism. If they never existed, if billions of people not believe in those religions and ""if"" many many books, schools, scholars have not created tons of knowledge about them.It just takes the matter so simple, this is not wise..",The Man from Earth
148,mrjdarcher,Just don't get the other reviews. 1/100,1,1 February 2021,I am well connected with the Christian community. Unfortunately most of their film are terrible due to budget script and trying to be deep and thought provoking. But to be honest if a terrible film was made and just the fact it is supposedly Christian would get thousands of fake or overly generous reviews.,The Man from Earth
149,sioenroux,A great couple hours of talking,9,22 January 2010,"If you can't handle people talking, you probably don't want to watch this film. On the other hand, if you're brain isn't so damaged or dysfunctional that you require constant car crashes, explosions, chase scenes or gunfights in order to stay awake and alert, then you might really like this movie.I preface my brief review that way because as interesting, complex, smart, funny, tense and intriguing as this movie is... it also is nothing more than a roomful of people talking the whole time. There are no convenient flashbacks or cutaways to illustrate some of the issues they discuss. You get to use your -- wait for it, wait... -- imagination for that part. Plus, it's necessary to the plot for you to remain in uncertainty.This is a great piece of science fiction, and a fun ride through a thought-experiment-made-real for this character's group of friends. Give it a try, if you're capable.",The Man from Earth
150,azcoppen,A brilliant high-brow film for the open-minded,8,18 January 2009,"This film was recommended to me by a friend and i probably wouldn't have seen it otherwise. So i checked IMDb to see what it was about and was shocked to see such a high rating for a relatively unknown flick, as well as the glowing reviews about its originality and simplicity.The beginning flustered me slightly as the acting seemed a little off and i got the impression it was one of those low-budget indie movies that had a great idea but a sucky production. But soon enough, things kicked in and i was knocked backwards. Don't be fooled or misled by a relaxed opening as its definitely needed as a setup to the much more intense hour ahead.Wow.Make no mistake, this is a film about religion. It's a profound idea. I couldn't believe how intelligent the script was, and how they managed to cram so much high-brow material into such a small amount of time. It won't appeal to everyone and i suspect that it will leave a lot of Christians very defensive and unassured. I'm quite versed in the historicity of the Jesus Myth theory so it didn't phase me, although i was a little put out that the issue was covered dominantly from one side.The most incredible thing to take back from watching this movie is that it is about challenging your beliefs and opening your mind. You find yourself as one of the people in the room, questioning what you know just as they do. The realism of the character's reactions is strong and distinct, just as it should be. But good sci-fi is all about stretching your mind. I was completely drawn in by the discussion with the characters themselves. The science of ageing is fascinating in itself. It's a very brave type of film to make when the current trend is for SFX and event-based storytelling. All based just on - an idea.Compulsory viewing for every thinker, student and movie-lover.",The Man from Earth
151,nysalesman100-1,"Had potential, but disappointing",2,17 November 2007,"As a scientist I was quite intrigued by this concept and thought the movie started out on a strong note. As a Christian I found it disappointing that such lengths were taken to discredit Christ. However, my religion is not the reason why I thought this movie petered out when jumping the chasm from science to religion.Instead of pondering how statistically unlikely it is that a single immortal would live for so long and survive being maimed, killed in war, travel, accidents, or murder this movie chose to end by pushing an anti-religious agenda. It sought to give credibility to the favorite theory of agnostics that Judaism and Christianity is a retelling of pagan folk-lore. It did this by having what appeared to be very learned people push a single side of this debate; without any of these scholars(even the one that believes in the Bible) discussing the other side, or the fact that many of these theories have been disproved. Furthermore, between the unlikely events of sailing with Columbus and being Jesus, I found the main character quickly lost credibility.In the end, I found this to be a poorly made movie instead of the intriguing and entertaining scientific masterpiece it could have been if the writers did their research and chose to perhaps have John know a religious figure (like one of the Profits, or Apostles) rather than be Jesus himself.",The Man from Earth
152,MashedA,It could only be made worse if Mark Wahlberg starred in it!,1,30 August 2009,"I'm sorry but this film is just not that good! Yes the premise behind the film was an interesting one, however it is badly actualised. The actors were so wooden that a carpenter would be embarrassed (when you have seen the film you will realise the pun).This would have been better suited to theatre, as a film it just can't keep you entertained simply because the dialogue is dreadful the backdrop dreary and uninspiring.For goodness sake, if you have no money you might want to ask your parents for a bit of pocket money. At least you could spend more than the price of a parking ticket on the whole movie! This film felt like a student had made this as a first project at college, there simply wasn't any direction, these guys just sat on their backside throughout the film.

153,Attila_the_gorilla,A very silly movie that somehow still works,8,2 August 2010,"Te overall premise of this film is very stupid to say the least, but they still managed to make a gripping movie out of it that attracts the viewer's attention. It's probably simply because there is conversation between intelligent adults, mostly about history. The acting is virtually non-existent, it's just one guy talking while others are reacting and asking questions. This lecture style really aids you to just go along with the story. Not much new is said in those conversations, but a pleasant insight into history, religion and such engaging topics.Said silly premise is that a young university teacher claims to be 14 thousand years old, when saying goodbye to some of his colleagues at a farewell gathering.Again, don't be put off by the silliness of the basic idea, it's an entertaining movie for those who enjoy mental stimuli.",The Man from Earth

The writer quickly revealed his personal lack of knowledge of history and then went on to commit all the usual mistakes that result from his particular world-view - a common one which has been done to death but never grows old. To mention more about it would reveal spoilers and if you watch this, you should go in unbiased.You will also either be sheltered enough to be ""amazed"" by this film, or you will see the same-old, same-old that has been going back and forth for centuries.What a wasted opportunity to do more - even a film like ""He Never Died"" (2015) makes this look clumsy and empty, and is a masterpiece in comparison.

160,Dccra1,Over-reaching pseudo-intellectual drivel,1,11 December 2016,"I confess that the initial premise was intriguing. What's not to like about a 14,000-year-old caveman who never ages and (with exception to his ""original"" Van Gogh) wasn't fond of worldly possessions, who gets the sudden impulse to share his secret with his friends? Not to mention, when would there be another chance for me to see an IMDb rating of ""8"" on a movie with the dude from ""Greatest American Hero"" in it? But it didn't take long for me to agree with another reviewer who said, ""Curse you IMDb for tricking me into watching this film!"" The 8 rating from those who drooled over this schmutz created the false ASSumption that it's one of the greatest movies of ALL time, but I soon learned that The Man From Earth is no more than over-reaching pseudo-intellectual drivel. Nonetheless, I watched as these has-been TV actors (and The Candyman) weaved this absurd tale with stereotypical caricatures who couldn't debate their way out of a wet paper bag. What started as a hypothetical game quickly turned into a loony who claimed he studied under THE Buduh for years... but then the little suspension of disbelief I had left went completely out the window after the caveman claimed to be Jesus Himself. I immediately said, ""Ah ha! Now I know why this has an 8 rating!"" Because it primarily catered to a demographic who relished seeing the mean (weak) ""Christian"" lady cry, squirm and lose her Faith. It angered me that it took almost an hour of my life before this disingenuous POS of a movie admitted it was politically charged. IMHO, I believe its sole purpose was (f)aith (believing the words of a kook who refused to provide physical evidence to back his claim) vs.Faith. If I'm wrong, with the bad acting, unrealistic interactions (no one tries to acquire evidence, a hair, fingerprint, something), and bad writing (the old man with the gun coincidentally being his son-in-law and dying of a heart attack), God only knows why anyone would swoon over this dreck.",The Man from Earth
161,runner-15,Takes a turn in the wrong direction.,3,16 November 2007,"MAJOR Spoiler, You have been warned!This movie starts off well enough and immediately grabbed my interest, and as others have said begins to seem like a sci-fi version of ""Twelve angry men"" but near the middle of the movie takes a left turn that will cost it many viewers. Although I did complete the movie and found the idea of a thousands of years old man living among us to be a very thought provoking concept, the fact that he claimed to be Jesus Christ is far too offensive to many potential viewers. What the makers of this movie have failed to account for is that there are many Christians in the world today that like a good science fiction yarn as much as the next guy. The makers also failed to consider that there are many characters in the Bible that John could have claimed to have been without being offensive, yet who would have still provoked thought and discussion. Several characters that come to mind are; Enoch, who disappeared without explanation. Methuselah, who was the oldest man who ever lived. Elijah, who disappeared in a whirlwind. Lazarus, Who Jesus raised from the dead. Heck, he could have even claimed to have been John the Baptist. And many people such as myself, I believe, would have found the idea that John could have been one of these people thought provoking. But instead, John claims to have studied under Buddha and then that it was he, who while bringing Buddha's teachings to the Middle East started the myth of Jesus Christ. This is far too offensive for many people to overlook. Why? Christian belief teaches that Jesus Christ was more than a man by being the incarnate son of God, born of a virgin who, lived a sinless life and was crucified, DIED and then rose from the dead. John tries to tell the viewer that Jesus is just a cave-man who happened to live forever, who studied UNDER Buddha, and lied about himself and faked his own death. In essence what Iam saying is that John didn't have to be Jesus to make a thought provoking statement.I did find the reactions by his friends to be very believable. And I found the on screen performances by everyone to be very good. I hadn't seen William Katt in good role for a while and also really enjoyed all the connections to Star Trek by the actors. But in the end what could have been a great movie was rendered impotent by the writers decision to attack the personal beliefs of over two thirds of the people in America.",The Man from Earth

A little bit of history mixed in with the idea that someone could live for 14000 years.The way his friends take in his story is so unrealistic.I'm really surprised by the high rating on here, I've seen movies with a rating of 5 stars that were not as bad as this.

I watched it because it's in the top 50 sci-fi films - it's my favourite genre and I was looking for something new.. The whole thing is over before it starts. The idea is laid out within the first 10 minutes and then you are left watching a group of awful stereotypes sitting and recited misplaced facts in the same room for two hours. This can be amazing (12 Angry Men etc) but the film is so poorly visualized it only bores you to tears. I am not one for big budget block busters but this is nothing more than made for TV crap - the direction and writing are dreadful, the throwaway music is annoying, and the acting wooden.

They are all here. Especially the acting. I'm glad they could afford those actors. Kudos on the acquisition. But one element of this gem, that I hold above all, is the ""story/concept"".One of the things that eludes me as a writer, how do you tell a story in one location? I've been trying to come up with a story that doesn't involve epic locations and special visual effects. I have a few ideas for movies that involve the subject matter of this movie, but, since I am a low-to-no budget filmmaker, I am concerned with how to express certain topics so frugally. I realize that it has to do with the dialogue and presentation of the story. This movie shows how one can tell a ""grand"" story with only one location.The subject matter is controversial. Some will hate this movie. Some will love it. But it is all based on verifiable sources. May be true... may not. However, it is good food for the mind (if one is open minded, that is).It's hard to write a comment about such a movie of this genre that doesn't give it away and still expresses how much this movie has enthralled me! One of the main premises of the movie is ""What would you believe?"". If a friend of yours came to you with information that unfolded your reality, would you stick with dogma, or have an open mind with what that ""friend"" of yours was saying? Could you let go of dis-belief, based on scientific ""fact"", enough to consider what your friend said ""might"" be true? I am definitely adding this to my collection.",The Man from Earth
167,Vlad_the_Reviewer,Low budget bulk acting,2,3 August 2012,"It's a complete mystery to me why this movie is rated this high. Looking at the reviews the high raters don't tell much about the movie quality but instead mention vague things like ""concept"" and ""idea"" and ""big questions"" and ""originality"". Guess they're up for a treat if they're impressed by this movie.The quality of acting is comparable with bulk acting you encounter in series like ""The Outer Limits"" for example; A bunch of expendable actors reading their script and emoting according to their script. Each of them is a baby-booming old type. Actually they're not all old. They dress like old people. It's the directors attempt to handle wardrobe due to the low budget I guess. More on that later.The scene is set in a single room in the house of the protagonist. A bunch of people listen to the ramblings of their friend they thought they knew. And then they say stuff which clearly comes off a script. And they forcibly act like they are supposed to. Whilst typing this review I'm also watching the movie once again just to make sure. I mean it, it looks like the actors never had acting lessons. Is it their fault? Often it's the director who doesn't know how to make good use of the actors. But one way or the other, it looks like stage acting by amateurs in a play meant for forgiving friends only.It's about a guy trying to come clean with new friends he made by revealing the truth (before leaving to some other place forever): he's not aging, he is 14000 years old already! Yep, he's seen it all, done it all, been everywhere. Cro Magnums and Columbus, no biggie. So he tells all this and his friends are like: ""Shall we believe him? Science doesn't know everything you know. Are you a lunatic or a caveman?"" (Yeah really, those questions were actually uttered as if it's a normal reaction to a friends insane ramblings)Don't expect anything special about effects or music. No effects and the music is standard bulk piano-play when we need sympathy for our main man. Like mentioned before, almost the entire scene is set in a single small(ish) living room with too many people. There were old people, professors and young pretty people and a wise calm Negro. No Asians or Arabs tho. It almost was a political correct movie. The cast just made me wanna puke because of it's lack of realism. It was too easy to notice how the cast was artificially assembled - that's the gist I'm trying to bring across here.Also like mentioned earlier, the wardrobe is horrible. The clothes were bought at a second hand store. Or maybe it was lying around in the basement of Wallmart. The director should have told the actors to bring their weekend clothing. That would have crated a much more realistic effect. Now it looks just silly. More like: oh I can see you're an actor. Gosh that leather jacket and those 20 Jeans, you're the non-complex working class cool guy right? Right. And gosh, you have a sweater without sleeves over a dull beige blouse. The sweater has every color of the rainbow in it but the colors are all pale, like you washed it too often the past 20 years. I guess you're the old lady. What other hints do I have? Your grey hair and wrinkles? How stereotype. Keep wearing that.The reality is that this movie is cheap and a cop out. A topic was created, and the rest of the movie tries (too hard) to build a story around that. In the beginning the friends of the protagonist are gullible and at the end they become more than skeptical. Exactly what the movie needs. Something to drag the movie on and something to end the movie. That's why I gave the movie 2 stars: it ends at one point.",The Man from Earth

However if you are a fan of story driven, intellectual films, like Donnie Darko for example, it may be right up your alley. It actually reminded me a lot of Twelve Angry Men, the entire film takes place basically in one room and you have one person trying to convince a group of others of a story, gradually they begin turning to his side. While this may not be an exciting thriller and the acting / filming leaves something to be desired, it does tell an interesting story and even includes a plot twist. The film does bring up some religious issues that may bother some viewers, however if you look at it with an open mind I think this can still be interesting to those people.",The Man from Earth

Could you?,10,7 December 2007,"I bought a big flat screen TV recently to enjoy one of my favourite things to do; Watch a story unfold and see the world in another perspective. Poëms, lyrics, novels or movies, they all serve the purpose of killing excess time in a comfortable way. This morning i decided, though really pressed for time, to see if my download (my bad) played at all. So i sat with my cig in the kitchen at my computer and double clicked. What can one expect from a movie called ""the man from earth""? Aren't we all from earth? Did this title give away a lack of creativity, or was there some intricate deeper meaning to it? Interesting... The clock is 3 feet to my right, but not a moment i could get myself to look at it. This movie grabbed me and still doesn't let go...Now who said you need many millions to make a great movie? This one proves them wrong. The story is simple, yet brilliant. The actors are not the best known, yet superb. The setting is so cheap, they even take out the furniture while the movie is being shot. Its almost funny even, though you forget to laugh because it keeps you constantly on the edge of your seat, trying to make sure you don't miss a sentence, a tear, or a grin.""What if?"" is the pre-acting question of our curiosity that drives our intellect and therefor always a great concept to use in any form of art. Now combine this with a second great concept of creating art; moving, or displacing and you have the story that is worth telling. This movie follows these principles and hits you right between the eyes. No need for car chases or big explosions, it could have been shot anywhere, with anything, and with basically anyone who can remember his lines and feels them.Now i praise this movie, but try not to expect anything. Just sit and let it take you as if it were just some friends that come over and someone tells a boring story, that in the end turned out...If you like Desperate Housewives Flying High this is not your type of movie. If you like science, possibility and are genuinely open minded this will blow you away.The only thing i regret about this movie is that i didn't watch it on my big flat screen TV...",The Man from Earth
170,yakikorosu,"Very weak attempt at a ""think"" sci-fi piece",5,15 September 2012,"First off, I am a huge fan of ""think"" sci-fi pieces, from Arthur Clarke to Fred Pohl to my personal favorite, Philip K. Dick, and have always thought the genre woefully underrepresented in films. So when I found out about this film and saw the high IMDb score (it was an 8.0 at the time) I eagerly bought it, only to be extremely disappointed. The biggest culprit here is the acting, which ranges from ""B"" quality at best to ""Z"" quality most of the time. It's particularly bad in the first 20 minutes of the film, and the only actor who gets into any kind of groove as it goes on is Tony Todd. The story is also rather uninteresting--Jerome Bixby just took the story to the Star Trek episode ""Requiem for Methuselah,"" which was a mediocre episode to begin with, and remade it at 2x the length. Unless you are thrilled at the idea of hearing lengthy discussions about the geographical layout of the Earth in the cro-magnon period, the first half of the movie is a complete waste. The film tries to regroup later on with a rather ambitious religious angle, and rides that to a few interesting scenes, but it lacks the insight to really explore the nuances of the subject matter, preferring an attack on religious conventions with the subtlety of a photon torpedo. To top it all off, there's a ridiculous, unnecessary, surprise ending that is worthy of M. Night Shyamalan (in case you're not sure, this is NOT a compliment). In the end, this is just a really overlong mediocre Twilight Zone episode, except with worse acting than they typically had on that show. Perhaps it has such an inflated rating on this site because 90% of its votes came from non-US users, who maybe saw this film dubbed or with subtitles, masking the poor acting.",The Man from Earth

But, this film brings up questions that I've never heard before and discusses possible answers in a medium that normally chooses to titillate rather than stimulate.Kudos to Jenkins and the team for bringing the book to life on the screen. Although shot on a small budget in virtually one location, it is of no import. The story and the way all the actors immersed into the story was the big sell.I heard about the movie on some site, somewhere and was fascinated by the story and the method of distribution. Turns out that pirates made the this movie popular; popular enough to bring some money around to make a second.

He goes on for hours dispelling several myths of history with his own personal testimony. When they're convinced he's telling the truth, he, predictably, confesses he was Jesus, and that the whole Bible is a crock. When I was awake, I heard lots of pop concepts and country club ""smartest guy in the room"" theories, none of which reflect any serious scholarship.Eventually, the humanist, non-religious progressives are proved right by the caveman's recollections, while the narrow Christians go away whimpering, but not before demanding he retract his entire story! (closing their eyes to the truth, you see). If there was ever a more clichéd portrayal of Christianity or religion in general, I haven't seen it. Moreover, I'm astonished at how many rate this movie so high when I wouldn't even call it a movie. It's more like a Saturday afternoon PBS special. And that they're so satisfied by lazy science baffles me.As a movie, there is no action, no climax, no palpable conflict that you can sink your teeth into, and no character development. It's a seminar on how liberal science and humanities department faculty see the world, and it's zenith, make no mistake, is that they were right all along, and religion is a phony invention of the weak.

It's speculative science fiction - but strictly without special effects . The tension comes from the dialogue.There are no fights. No chase scenes. There are no bad guys to hate. No monsters, no beams of light from the heavens.It's a movie about ideas centering around what some may choose to see as the telling of a Tall Tale.The action takes place almost entirely in one room and consists almost entirely of people's facial expressions. Like sitting around a campfire with a group of good friends listening to strange and impossible stories. Quite intimate - and in its way, intense.But those who enjoy nitpicking and taking movies apart will certainly find some fodder. So too will those who are easily bored.Those who are very faithful to their various religions will also find much to dislike here. The movie is quite humanistic, though not dismissive of religious belief.I have watched this movie several times, and have enjoyed it each time. I feel myself drawn in every time.

The story failed to deliver the right concepts and depictions of Bible characters.Questioning the myth about the prophet Moses is questioning the Old Testament itself and God itself afterwards, which is very vulnerable for young souls with unstable faith in God.The same threat comes with Jesus Christ. To deny his spiritual choice, enlightenment and following resurrection is downscaling a power of a human being as a spiritual being, which gives space for brutality, degradation of the human consciousness and the distraction of atheism.",The Man from Earth

I like the one set films (open water, carnage, phone booth to name a few). The dialogue was awesome because it had a genuine sense of regular conversation; very important with these types of movies and it was done well. Felt like a window to a real situation.To those who critique harshly: taking into account b-movies and older films from 1920's up until today; which I view they equal footing to one another as an art piece. Why critique harshly the production and acting?... a story meant to be read (the book/dialogue is more important), it would stir one's thought and emotions up the way it was meant to be... without visual distractions. I thank this film for leading me towards a potentially very good book.",The Man from Earth
179,symbolt,a deep story and a taste of what good SF can be like,7,12 December 2007,"I was delighted to watch this movie. I have always been a fan of science fiction literature, as well as sci fi cinema. Sadly, sci fi cinema usually presents us with VERY simplistic stories, and if we are lucky, some good entertainment. Very rarely are we treated to anything spiritually enriching. This movie has a lot of what good literary science fiction has to offer - a story with a simple science-fiction gimmick with good potential, developed in such a way that without any CGI and car chases, we get to experience something exciting and certainly worth our time. Like I said, the basic idea, of a character having lived through thousands of years, is not that original, but as both an avid sci fi cinema and story fan I can tell you that I can't think of a single story or movie which developed the idea so intelligently and coherently.This movie gives us insightful perspectives on knowledge, memory and identity, and the impact of one's actions on the perceptions of others, and how those perceptions can be forged into reality, either through time (history) or categorization (as sane, insane, credible etc). Although the movie is mostly dialog, and at the beginning I was preparing myself to be bored by the format, what is being said is so interesting that it will certainly hold your attention, especially that we get to see strong performances from the main characters/talkers (all are good enough). Also, the movie is not too long, and has very nice pacing for what it is (not an action movie). Strong science fiction stories found their way onto the screen before, but they were usually simplified or censored (think Twilight Zone) or watered down to fit into a simpler, action-oriented frame (like most adaptations of Philip K. Dick and Isaac Asimov), and there have been many examples of original screen science fiction, but the story in this movie is the work of someone with a great deal of insight on what people are, it is spiritually enriching without being moralizing at all, and is portrayed in a very nice peaceful movie too. So give yourself a treat and buy the DVD - I hear this is independent cinema, so they will need all the support you can give. Skip a box-office hit and use the ticket money to give yourself the pleasure of seeing something truly original. I really recommend this.",The Man from Earth

Whether you elect to call this movie a drama, science fiction or even science fiction drama, it knocks your socks off. The including of certain elements in the plot (you will know if you have seen it what I mean) was really a breath of fresh air and I really enjoyed the explanations there.The dialog and acting in this movie was surprisingly good. It has a good, strong cast that really deliver their subtle and at times not-so-subtle emotions. I especially loved Tony Todd, Richard Riehle and Ellen Crawford driving the plot forward. These are three excellent actors we have seen in the past, never at the top of the charts, but still made themselves deservedly noticed.This movie is actually a textbook example of what the SCIENCE in science fiction means. This is a true science fiction movie, acted out as a drama. And the combination works extremely well.

181,wikipediacabal,The poster cost more than the movie,3,18 November 2013,"I have never seen an IMDb rating that made me as suspicious as this film's has. I believe someone like the film's owner created tens of thousands of fake 10-rating votes. It's the most economical explanation for the large number of votes that this straight to video, genre effort has collected, and the very high average of those votes, especially considering how much lower is the average of the votes accompanied by written reviews. If you're thinking of paying to see this because of the high rating, please be very suspicious.The movie is just awful. It's really bad SF on a really low budget but it does meet some basic standards of competence. Some people do go for any SF and they are welcome to enjoy it. It looks like a soap opera or an infomercial, shot on old video equipment. There's just one set, with just one big key light in each scene for quick camera setups without needing to relight. There's almost no sound engineering or music.I can only suggest that anyone who appreciates this film should try reading some good SF instead. It's a better vehicle than a low budget film for an author to explore an idea.The script is toilet paper in my opinion. The philosophical ideas are painfully simple. The religious ideas are idiotic, on the level of Erich Von Däniken, Dan Brown or other New Age heretical nonsense. I'm an atheist myself but I can at least listen thoughtfully to some serious thinkers in the Catholic, Unitarian, Episcopalian or Reconstructionist Jewish traditions. I have a special lack of respect for people like L. Ron Hubbard who cook up their own synthetic invention and present it as revealed truth.

182,duanekimball,Total letdown and too little story,3,2 December 2007,"First, this ""movie"" looks like a play put to the big screen. I looks like it should be in a theater. It does not translate well.Second, the story just has too many holes and not enough answers. The guy has 14,000 years to finally tell the ""truth"" to his friends and this is the best he can do? He has very few details and the story goes too far to explain why the author couldn't provide those details by saying that it's too hard to remember details.He provides no proof, which, like believing in a god, would be a clincher. Waiting for him to provide this proof, I guess I was asking too much. How hard would it be to show a 100 year old picture of yourself?He studied with Buddha and was Jesus...ugh. I think the writer must have evolved the whole story around that. (i.e. No childhood of Jesus and appeared around 35 y/o, and survived a crucifixion)The ending was SOOOOO weak. He ""accidently"" blurbs out the he use to be some guy who happened to be the father of one of his friends, who happens to die from the shock. Hey, that's convenient. Why bother telling your girlfriend, when you can tell your son?Acting: I think the main lead guy did a good job with what he had. The director must have told everyone else to overact by acting ""intelligently angry"" the whole movie.Science Fiction is a generous genre to put this into. I think the poster art is cool and obviously was hoping for more.My wife walked out 1/2 way thru and I had to tell her the rest of the story, which took 4 seconds of my time.",The Man from Earth

It is not a movie for anyone looking for special effects or violence. Nobody shoots anybody and there are no aliens. And the space travel is all inside of the collective Western mind. The whole movie was shot in a small, average house - with a shot or two outside where two or three cars are parked. All at night. No pretty scenery or shrubs. It is basically a conversation, so there are a number or characters - well played and well directed. There will be no Oscars for acting, it is not that sort of movie. But there is no inadequacies either. All is very well and neatly done. And that is how it should be, because the action and the utter fascination is all in the story that unfolds. It starts slow. Then it at some point you think you can see where it is going, and it is cheap and disappointing now, you think - then it goes there (!) and lifts off and transcends many things, among them was my jaded expectation of where it will go (and sort of went)!

187,Vergilya,Get ready for brain food,8,2 January 2008,"This is the kind of movie that grabs you at your intellectual level and challenges you to come face to face with what you know as the truth. The story could not be any simpler and straightforward than this. With only one location, eight characters and a very intense and profound conversation the good old story telling method is back.It looks more like a stage play than a commercially embellished feature film. John, a colleague among the other lecturers who consists of a Christian literalist, anthropologist, archaeologist, psychologist and biologist, is given a farewell get-together on his last day in his home. They were all curious as to why he is leaving without saying goodbye and without a credible reason.After urging him to tell them why he was packing up to go he reveals a secret far greater than they could accept. From an amiable confabulation among friends it gradually disconcerted everyone with the stories of his past and turned the gathering into a debatable contention.There are no sidetracking to this movie but a wholesome erudition of ideas and theories within the confines of a room. This could have been one of the Star Trek or Twilight Zone episodes where thought provocation is the basis of good story telling.Although it looks like a low budget movie with mostly unknown stars this is one of the better movies I have seen in a long time.

With a premise like this you would expect to be fed Highlander style flashbacks, but they spared us that trope, thank you! It's exactly as big as it needs to be.The dialog and plot is tight, with very little padding. The relationship between the characters is established well. It's not that they believe John, it's that they love him as a person and trust him.

190,walleye-42537,"This movie is one of those little known about, hidden gems",9,18 January 2018,"Ok, for those of you that have read my comments on movies in the past, you know I rarely have given a movie a rating of over 8. Especially a movie that might have a smaller budget (most of them I have seen just aren't that good). This one however, IS THAT GOOD.It has a very interesting concept and story line as well as some Actors you will have seen from MANY other projects, especially guest starring on TV shows, heavy on sci-fi. The Lead is David Lee Smith who has been in a few things but popped up as Lt. Stetler on CSI:Miami towards the end of it's run. He is easily a ""Go To"" lead in my opinion. Tony Todd whom I saw for the first time in the remake of ""Night of the Living Dead"" and who I think has been on nearly every Sci-Fi and Horror Show since the 90's and is a very solid actor is also on board. John Billingsley, another actor in this movie that has a ton of work on his resume but I think is best known as Dr. Phlox on Star Trek:Enterprise. Ellen Crawford who has been acting since I was a Senior in High School and is best known as Nurse Wright on ER. Richard Riehle who is another one you will recognize instantly and probably has been on nearly every TV show ever made since the 70's lol. A few other relative unknown actors who are surprisingly good and then of course....... A personal favorite of mine as a youngster, ""The Greatest American Hero"" himself, MR. William Theodore Katt. 
I remember back in the mid 80's he saved me from being forced to watch what I thought was going to be a complete disaster of a movie on a first date with a young girl who I was VERY smitten with and I thought that the date would be equally disastrous as I really liked her but I didn't think the feeling was mutual. 
Then to find out she dragged me to a movie called, ""Baby: Secret of the Lost Legend"" at a theater with nasty popcorn, well, I was simply contemplating going to the bathroom for the 1 1/2 hours of the movie lol.
As I was looking for the closest exit, Lo and Behold, I was in for several surprises that evening, first off, the Popcorn was still nasty, but I saw William Katt appear on the screen and with his quirky acting ability, he did not disappoint. 
And then the biggest surprise of them all, after about 5 minutes into the movie, the girl turned and looked at me and said, ""Thank you very much for taking me to this movie, I really wanted to see it but none of my friends or family wanted to"". Then she proceeded to lightly grab my chin, pulled my face to hers and gave me ""THE KISS"". You know, ""the kiss"" that made everything in your body, mind, and soul come alive and you just knew she was ""The One"".Anyways, back to The Man from Earth. 
The movie was shot at basically one location which kills more movies than it helps. At that point, in order for a movie to ""Make it"", it needs to have a Strong Story, Acting, and Dialogue. Most movies like this fail miserably, but not this one. The story by Jeremy Bixby was SOLID. He had a small resume of some sci-fi show writing like Star Trek and others, but I believe this was his first ever stand alone ""Book"". Well, Mr. Bixby NAILED IT. Sadly he passed away in 1998 and never got to see his Book turned into this WONDERFUL movie. The Directing is also pretty important and Richard Schenkman who had about a dozen Directorial projects under his belt when he took the helm of this project did a Bang Up job with it. The Acting was Solid and what you would expect out of a mostly very experienced cast and the Dialogue was pretty decent with more High Points than low ones.I don't know what the Budget was on this movie, I can't believe it was very much with most of it probably going to Cast and Crew, but when I see a movie like this, it shows that even a lower budget movie can have the look and feel of a Big Name Studio Flick with a Larger Budget.I have seen this movie over 9 times during the course of the last 10 years and I am entertained every time. They recently came out with a Sequel to it, ""The Man from Earth, Halocene"" which I just watched and they are planning on hopefully a 3rd installment or better yet, making it into a series. There is so much and so many directions sequels and/or a series can explore with the Main Character, John Oldman. I have no doubt this franchise would end up becoming something many people would watch and become vested in. At the very least, it would end up with a large Cult following for sure.I gave this movie a 9, something I rarely do. While it may not be as strong as some of the other movies I gave 9's to, it is just more than an 8. While not perfect (very few movies are), it has MANY more good things about it than bad and it is a movie that really makes you think ""What If?""Do yourself a favor, track this movie down and watch it. Then, watch it a second, third, and fourth time and you will really grow to love it.",The Man from Earth
191,sinefilcinephile,Make sure you watch this movie!,10,17 March 2021,"I have seen this movie umpteen times. It is my all time favorite along with Back to the Future. Never seen a more thought-provoking script in my life so far. You cannot disprove John's claims. It is like a history book mixed with solid claims in the centre of religion. The film takes place in only one setting, but the dialogues wrap you tightly and make you think that John Oldman's claims are really plausible.

He had everyone convinced, then admits it was all a story. As the group leaves, John confides in the one remaining woman that in fact it was all true. In providing her with some of the names and recent places, the story is over heard by an old man, a psychologist, who it is revealed is in fact John's son. The story was all true and was being told as the young man moved on, as he had to do when people began to notice his age. The old man dies of heart failure in his sons arms, and it transpires John has never seen one of his children die in 14,000 years.All through the movie, I wanted to believe him but thought I would be let down in the end by the usual American ending. In fact this is one of the best scripts in years. I saw the movie makers comments on RLSLOG. If only I had been able to see if on the big screen.As we say in Australia, it was a real Beaut! Utterly amazing. How on earth do people think these things up?",The Man from Earth
193,Lord Onim,Landmark Science Fiction - Not To Be Missed,8,17 December 2007,"Just finished watching The Man from Earth a few minutes ago. My first impression was just WOW. Early on in this film though, the acting felt a bit poor, as in not very convincing. However, that soon changed as the film progressed, and I started to realise what a clever movie this really is. Only after a few minutes the excitement started to build up. At this point TMFE really ""owns"" you, and just won't let go until the end. It's clever because it never really lets you in on all the secrets, there's always a little shadow of doubt.I believe the movie could be put into comparison with a magic night which you never want to end. Exactly that is how I felt towards this movie. It was captivating, from beginning to end.Moreover, this motion picture felt a bit short. Maybe John could have been developed further, maybe it could have gone deeper. I also thought it ended a little bit too soon and I was not entirely satisfied, despite the ending being plausible. Although I guess it had to follow Jerome Bixby's screenplay? That said, I must underline that the excitement that engulfed 99% of this movie outweighs the limited runtime. Overall this is an excellent movie that discusses important topics and really gets your mind working. I will certainly watch it again many times to come. Kudos to the makers of this film. It was about time a science fiction movie of this type was made! I'm also thankful that you demonstrated that science fiction can be so much more than space ships and ray guns to the general public. I might even get some of my friends who are die hard non-SF fans to watch this. It is probably the best science fiction story since The Matrix. Very well done. 8/10",The Man from Earth

It started kind of awkward and then once it picked up speed on thoughts and comments, I had to try hard to follow. I have almost read most of the history, religion and Eastern philosophy and could not appreciate better that someone can make this type of movie. Movie has its own style to lead you into a concept and then give you various perspectives. Someone became Atheist after watching this movie, I will not say it goes to that extent but yes if you are very religious you have to think again after seeing the movie from another perspective. I recommended to one of my friend and she liked it a lot, though she had to rewind couple of times to get it.",The Man from Earth
195,adamapp,The best sci-fi film you've never seen,9,5 January 2008,"This film, a low budget science fiction film, may very well be one of the best science fiction films of the past 10 years. This film is intense. It provokes thought in such a way and belongs up there will films such as 2001; A Space Odyssey, The Quiet Man, and any series, including Star Trek.Considering the writer of the script wrote some of Star Trek:OS most memorable episodes, it's little wonder that the movie manages to resonate so much.The story focuses on a professor who, at his going away party, reveals himself to be a cro-magnon over 14,000 years old. The score is understated, which is fine, because the material doesn't require a musical cue to tell you when to feel or think something. The material already has you.Combine great script writing with epic performances by John Billingsley, David Lee Smith and Tony Todd and you have one of the most riveting pieces of science fiction made in a long time.",The Man from Earth
196,bk-87668,I am glad people still have imagination,8,18 April 2008,"Originally, I wanted to say this movie probably gained more momentum from the whole Internets torrent thing than from the actual movie. However, after thinking about the movie for a few months (how many movies make you do that?) I am glad I didn't say that in the first place.I am also very glad people still have imagination. I'm not talking about the people involved in making the movie or the writer of the original story. I mean the people who watched the movie and thought it was good. The movie is basically a series of tracking shots of people talking and talking in one little room, yet I almost remember the movie as a big budget movie with scenes depicting John's life.Another thing I'd like to point out that John is surprisingly fresh as a character. You get a sense that he's grown past the trendy cynical attitude characters like him usually are. Even the inevitable (or even cliché or naive) connections these kinds of stories have do not feel very forced. You already are in the mode for accepting that kind of stuff when they are revealed.The whole movie could be an episode of The Twilight Zone (one of the episodes written by Mr. Serling, of course) but it works surprisingly well as a feature-length movie. I guess some of the acting is a bit uneven and some other director would have done something a bit differently but all that just adds to the charm of this movie. I have to say David Lee Smith was very good as John.In all, the movie is well worth downloading, watching and then buying. It shows a great amount of honesty for the makers to acknowledge the ""illegal"" downloading as a viable way to promote your product - of course, as long as the product is good. I guess the character of John also could be described as honest - there's this weird aura of honesty around the movie.",The Man from Earth
197,zahmed_1970,Atheist Agenda in full Swing,1,11 August 2017,"I saw this due to ratings, was interesting first 30 mins or so after that the Atheist kicked-in in Full Force. The main character claims that he was in The Bible and later that he was Jesus Son of Mary himself and then refute all the claims ... The writer was a known Atheist, discredited and refuted Moses PUBH but did not came close to Islam and mentioned anything about it ... This movie is pure blasphemy, As a Muslim, in Koran, in Surrah Baqarah (The Cow):285 Say that ""we believe in His Angels, His Books and all his Messengers/Prophets and we do not Differentiate amongst them"" So disrespecting Moses, Jesus Son of Mary PUBH and ridiculing the Faiths (Judaisms and Christianity even though they are mot my faiths) in this piece of garbage was disappointing.

I love thoughtful, deep, well crafted and scripted movies.So I plugged it in and I'm sorry to say but the reviews of this movie have to be rigged. The acting in this movie is beyond terrible. Go watch the trailer on youtube and decide for yourself if it looks appealing. The trailer acting is actually 10 times better than the acting in the movie itself. On a positive note the concept of the movie is actually somewhat intriguing. Unfortunately, the plot feel very contrived. If you ended up on this page because you are a sci-fi fan like me and were looking for good sci-fi movies to enjoy my advice would be do a little more research on the film before committing to watching it.",The Man from Earth
201,LipjamUK,Poor acting poor directing poor cinematography Just Poor,1,7 June 2015,Reading some of the highly listed reviews I though I was about to watch an overlooked gem. I was sadly mistaken. I am a fan of Sci-Fi and the lack of CGI didn't put me off. The opening scene made it apparent this was a low budget straight to TV release but I was still prepared to watch this movie for the promise of something special. I was deeply disappointed. This movie is so bad it doesn't even warrant a one. The story line is so shambolic it could only have come from a seriously deranged mental patient. The characters are so annoyingly stereotypical that painting a 2 dimensional picture of them would give them depth. The look and feel of the movie screams cheap so loud it would bring the birds from the trees.This is just a very poor movie on so many levels that to see it get an 8 is just amazing. Probably the only amazing thing about this movie. Save your time and money.,The Man from Earth
202,Gabriel_Kuntze,Like a Longer Twilight Zone Episode,7,23 December 2020,"This movie felt like a longer TWILIGHT ZONE episode, but unlike this amazing show, it lacked a proper and surprising finale. Instead, it abruptely ended and left me empty, instead of wanting to know more about the protagonist, or think about the ramifications of his condition.
The premise is simple. A young professor is retiring and his partners throw him a goodbye party, in which he decides, for no real reason, to reveal them a huge secret: he's 14.000 years old. At first it's really engaging, and like the characters, you want to keep up with John. But as soon I realized that this guy seems to be always in the exact moment of history, managing not only to meet famous figures but also becoming one himself, I stopped believing the whole ordeal, and therefore, giving a damn about it.
I mean, not only he had the most incredibly luck ever, surviving thousands of years without getting into a fatal accident, disaster, or war, but he also stood right alongside unique people from history, just because of it - and don't even make me go to the ""twist"". Suspension of disbelief can only be strechted so far.The story reminded me a lot to K-PAX (a good one, but sadly a ripoff of an argentinian movie called HOMBRE MIRANDO AL SUDESTE), but unlike that one, you don't end wondering if the story is true or not. Here, you're 100% sure: the guy is, in fact, 14.000 years old, which personally I felt it was a dumb move. I think it would've been much better if we didn't knew for sure if he was telling the truth.Still, it's a good movie. I liked the low budget feel, the grainy look, and the acting is pretty good, even when the characters are so cliched and ridiculous (what's up with the middle aged guy carrying a student in his motorcycle btw?).

204,megagurka,"Interesting idea, flawed movie",5,9 November 2011,"OK, first let me say that I agree that the basic idea of the movie is interesting and thought provoking. But the main question is: does it work as a movie? No, not really. The big problem is that when after the man's initial confession there's not much story to keep the movie going for 90 minutes. And the big ""surprise"" half way through the movie is not that intriguing unless you're a religious person (which I'm not). The ending is totally unsurprising and bland.The whole movie basically takes place inside one room with the same bunch of people, which obviously makes it hard to keep up the viewer interest for the entire movie. If Spielberg or Cameron was directing this I'm sure it would be lots of historical look-backs spiced up with fancy computer effects, which at least would make the movie more entertaining. The production, acting, dialog, sound editing etc. is so bad it feels you're watching an episode of Twilight Zone rather than a feature film. You can really tell that this is very low budget.So, in conclusion, interesting idea, but much more is needed to make a good movie.P.S.

In truth I was amazed to find out that the film was created in 2007, and in truth only the Audi being driven in the final stages really convinced me.This film was breath taking. I just read on wikipedia that the author of the screenplay passed away, which I was extremely disappointed to see. The litany of people that Jerome Bixby influenced is only a hint of how great this film is.Situated in what appears to be a remotish cabin on a hill-face 5 people catch a youngish man 35-40 packing a pickup, obviously preparing for a journey; boxes packed and bin liners filled. The film is sly even from the outset, the hints are malevolently obvious, yet exquisitely seductive. This film tells a story that is a master-piece to behold and the director, cast and simple production (Not many films have the limitation of being situated in one room - but this just makes the film more timeless) as a whole will allow this movie to stand apart in time.Well worth a watch once....

206,jkling-1,Good concept. Mediocre execution,5,25 March 2012,"Being a big fan of science fiction, I can understand how some will feel that this movie is ""so innovative"". Conceptually, it is but how they actually carried out the movie just makes it ""so so"" at best. I wanted to like this move, I really did. But I just can't.Basically the movie is one giant wanna-be mental circle jerk, with a bunch of folks sitting around in a living room. The constant light music background score was annoying. It would have been much better if they had purely stuck to using real music, being played in the background, as they did at one point. After all - it's a going away party for the guy, right? So why not have music playing ...One piece that particularly killed any hope of suspension of disbelief is the director's idiotic decision to take the out of shape and older Harry - the actor is 55 and isn't exactly well preserved, and have him make a mock attack and then claim that he's a 2nd degree black belt. Oh yeah ... black belt in buffet lines and lying on his couch .... maybe. Ridiculous.I could go on, but as it is watching the movie is something like ""90 minutes of my life that I won't get back"". So I'm not going to compound this by writing up anymore.Bottom line is that this is high concept and poor execution. It's just that simple.",The Man from Earth

The corny music should have been a little less prominent--actually threatened to drown out the dialogue in places (later, the Beethoven on the little boom box was even worse, cornier than the old bible broad was ugly). It's worth a watch to the end. Liked the old Buddha /Jesus Syrian/Moses business, but better was the idea to leave people to their own devices, no matter how repugnant. Was a lot more fun as a drawing room play than as a lot of volcanoes and swelling oceans (those long ago times) with the swelling music of another film maker.

The first 10 minutes were slow to start off and I was wondering if it was going anywhere - then it did.I sat mesmerized as the story unraveled and right up to the very end, I was entertained; entranced and enjoying this movie.To say too much about the content could potentially spoil the enjoyment for new viewers, so I'll just say ""watch it"".For once, ""Holywood"" has released a thinking persons movie - it's not one of the en-masse pulp that's being released for general consumption - and, I believe it's not a movie that you'll regret spending time and/or money watching.",The Man from Earth

It's that short story that you wake up at 4AM and finish. It's that story that just turns your whole way of thinking upside-down. It's the story that changes how you think about the world around you, what it is, what it was, and most importantly, what it *could be* in the future.And it did it all with a great story, great characters, and almost no special effects. In one room.I could look at this story in retrospect and talk about the plot, about the ""coincidence"" of having a Religious Nut, a Psychiatrist, a Biologist, and an Anthropologist all in one room together, but I never thought about this for a moment during the movie. It was smooth. The characters were believable, and awkward at times. The conversations were rapid-fire, and then stilted. The story was all the better for it.This movie deserves all the ratings it's getting here, and more. I am afraid most closed-minded religious sorts are going to give this movie 1 out of 10.

This movie doesn't belong to any of the extremes. It definitely doesn't deserve the lowest rating, since the idea and the theater like execution keeps you awake and also the discussions between the characters throughout the movie is sort of entertaining. But it also doesn't belong to the TOP. Current 8/10 rating is a bit overrated. Especially the cheesy and kind of rash ending ruined the whole movie for me.

216,russell100uk,The power of a good script...,9,25 December 2008,"Very rarely do I feel the need to write a comment about a film on IMDb, there's usually little point as the film is already highly acclaimed or a decent, thought not mind-blowing movie experience. However tonight I watched this small, minimally produced one room drama unfold and felt compelled by its conclusion to write something about what a throughly refreshing and stimulating experience it was.There are no car chases, gun fights, steamy sex scenes or overblown fight sequences on offer here. The story is confined to a small cabin in the middle of nowhere where a handful of people debate matters of science, religion, theology and physics. In short then, 9/10's of the population will be bored stupid by this movie.But that's okay, because this movie will never be a blockbuster best-seller, will never have (nor ever aim for) mass appeal. Instead it is a low-budget science fiction drama which shall find a niche among the cult crowd, a flick that is often talked about but rarely actually witnessed first hand, much like Primer from a few years back.The movie unfolds at a tremendous pace, not in it's rapidity, but in it's perfect balance between recollection and debate. As the story of our central character, John Oldman, a history professor who claims, to the bemusement of a handful of gathered colleagues, to have lived for 14,000 years, the film shifts gears and delivers several fantastic twists and moments which endeavour to confuse and even anger the gathered few. What starts of as little more than a perceived hypothetical scenario slowly unravels to become a heated debate, by the end of which, will leave the viewer just as exasperated as his esteemed colleagues he has chosen to share his closely guarded secret with.People have compared this movie to Kevin Spacey's K-PAX, but they are nothing alike. John Oldman is not a being from outer space nor a mentally deranged lunatic, he is simply a man who has experienced far more than the average human and is at a loss to truly explain how, or why for that matter, he is different. As his story unfolds he bats away many of the more inane objections with his own analogous comparisons, particularly focusing on the human perception of time in relation to his own extraordinary life cycle. The Man From Earth asks many questions and answers many more, and by the end you too will be uttering the sentiments much repeated throughout the movie: Anything is possible.",The Man from Earth

Man claims to be Jesus but says he only repeated what Sidharta Gautama told him,3,18 August 2020,"There was a good premise here in 'what if a person never died; would they be super intelligent?' I liked the philosophical discussion around that premise, hence the 3 stars, but there is nothing ""Sci-Fi"" about this story which unfolds entirely in the man's living room. This movie exposes the myopic world view of Darwinists in their limited understanding of the greater picture; i.e. the purpose of life. Darwinists are ready and willing to destroy the typical religionist view that the purpose of life is 'to die and go to heaven' and rightly so since that view is just as myopic as their own.Suffice to say that there is a much bigger picture which both Darwinists and religionists are missing. Sadly, this flick touches on none of that. It merely bashes religionism in a passive/aggressive manner. This flick ponders the question of ""what if there had been a man who lived through the 'hunter-gatherer' age up until the modern age. What would he be like and what would he feel is his purpose? Sadly, the culmination of all the philosophical posturing is as bleak as a Darwinist's future. The position of the flick is one-sided. Never do they ponder the question of 'what if the Creator of the universe actually sent a representative to show mankind how they should think and act?'

222,ryan-1237,A Gem In Need Of A Little More Work,6,26 December 2008,"I enjoyed this movie. I appreciated that the entire film was solely based on dialog and that there were no fancy flashback scenes. And I also enjoyed the intellectual challenge posed by the film.I think though that this film could have been so much better. For this film to work it really needs to be a lot more thought-provoking and ground breaking intellectually.As a historian I loved the idea and was thrilled to see it being played out. However I was disappointed that the story revolved around Western Civ 101.The story of the birth of Christianity as told by the main character is an old and favorite of amateur historians mostly told at cocktail parties to impress and create controversy.I was really hoping and expecting something new, exciting and thought-provoking. Instead the story is based on trivia and historical generalities (e.g. pig farmer friend of Van Gogh, student of the first Buddha, etc...).The idea of a man living from the dawn of human history is a vast literary treasure trove. And yet all this movie focuses on is the roots of Christianity. David Lee Smith's character, John Oldman, lived 40,000 years and yet the only details of that incredible story he re-tells are of being Jesus and his convenient friendship with Van Gogh which he never describes.This film could've been a beautiful and amazing insight into human history and into the human condition and all it turns out to be is an agnostic vehicle.I rated the film 7/10 as the idea is wonderful, the dialog is decent and the simple presentation is daring and well-done.Where the film fails is in the poor cinematography and lighting. Its almost as if the director was directing a play vs a film. The characters are all boring stereotypical professors with the addition of their attractive female devotees/flunkies--Alexis Thorpe and Annika Peterson.Furthermore the film's inability to tap into the wonderful richness of the human story keeps it grounded in mediocrity.",The Man from Earth
223,jameszxcvbn,I love smart movies,1,4 February 2016,"I am a huge fan of movies that makes me critically think about the resolution and the point; also the ending. Movies such as Usual suspect or the Memento are one of my all time favourites. Sure I stumbled onto this movie because of the rating it was given, and as a simple man I like watching movies that are rated high. But upon reading the synopsis was when I really wanted to watch this movie because I could sense that the movie would deliver me some mind- puzzling session throughout the runtime.To speak my point, I was very captured by this movie throughout the end but I decided to give 1. The topic of the shift of time from one man's perspective and the respective audience (John's friends) giving their own insights into the topic was all too mind bottling and I was anxious to hear what would happen in the end because a rating this high would not have a blunt ending when the introduction is so anticipating. Hence I waited and when John decides to speak about how he was Jesus and how he was friends with the Buddha and how Christianity was really a hoax of what people wanted to believe deeply offended me. Now, don't take this the wrong way because I am not a Christian nor a Buddhist. I am deeply offended at the idea of how a simple movie created by a simple direction could touch on such a sensitive topic such as a religion into something so simple and offending. I found it hugely blasphemous at this movie even when I don't have a religion. I guess I just felt it for the rest of the Christians out there.A director or the writer could throw in a little scene with 'let's make the main character Jesus since the character we have given him is deemed immortal and lived over a 14000 years, so might as well fit it in as well' and it would seem intelligent because the protagonist have built up his knowledgeable depiction throughout the first hour of the film from discussing all the truthfully spoke history before he touched on the fact that he was Jesus. This is offending because it would have changed a vast majority of the people's viewpoint on religion... why?It's just my point of view on this movie.",The Man from Earth

The caveman turns out to be Jesus. Why movie? There were so many great directions to go and you choose to crap on religion. If that wasn't enough they make the Christian woman look like a hysterical simpleton. If that wasn't enough the rest of the cast attacks her for her beliefs. The movie is still worth the watch but the twist seriously reduces my score. It's a 6/10 that could've easily been a 9/10.",The Man from Earth
225,prohibited-name-2256,big disappointment (see the movie first then read this),3,7 October 2008,"You got to give some credit to the script, as the concept is very original and it could have been a great movie, but there are so many holes in The Man from Earth that it's very hard to ignore. This is why I'm so surprised, considering all the 10s and 9s and all the wonderful reviews here.First of all, the concept is great but the script is sooooo naive. We get to hear incredible story from the main character, which at first keeps the expectations very high, but with time we see more and more of a lack of attention to detail. I could accept Buddha and Jesus story, although it's not easy, but Columbus and Van Gogh? The man had to have one heck of a talent when it comes to finding the most important people in the history of mankind, not to mention how charming he must've been to find a way to get near them. It would be nice to see at least some shadow of that charm, but instead we see an introspective shy man with a character of a person that just spent 30 years with his mom in the mountains. Smart men get smarter with time, so I'd expect a little bit more overall level of comfort, harmony and positive attitude from someone who was enlightened by Buddha and changed the mentality of mankind forever as Jesus due to his extraordinary teachings.The actor really didn't put much to his role, or maybe he just doesn't have the skills, but during the movie he failed many times to express his emotions with style. Character is shallow and boring. But his girlfriend is worse.As for a girl finding out that her boyfriend is 14.000 years old, she acts like it was nothing. Either the character is addicted to heroine (which would explain her non-acting during most of the movie), or the actress is a) friend of producer/director, or b) not much of an actress.The old doctor mr. Smarty and all just lost his wife day ago, yet comes to a social meeting like he just had the best sex of his life and has to spread that joy around. It takes a lunatic who claims that he's Jesus to remind him (in a very twisted and we-just-couldn't-think-of-anything-better way) that the guy's wife died recently.Add to this the ""I'm your father/grandfather (don't remember) and I know your dog's name"" and you have an amazingly disappointing finish line. It really doesn't take much to create a better way to show people that he really is THE MAN. They say in the movie that Jesus and Buddha must be turning in their graves if they know what people have transformed their teachings into. Well if they really existed and they have graves, I hope nobody dares to throw into them iPods with this movie on hard disk, because they would spin 3 times the previous speed! I could go on and on with this, and I realize how many people will hate me because this comment, as this movie seems to have a lot of fans, but it's been a long time since I have seen a movie which tries to be so deep and moving, and which at the same time is so shallow and unsatisfying. 3 for the concept, 0 for the rest.",The Man from Earth

229,Vantec,Clever but deeply flawed,6,10 February 2008,"'The Man from Earth' is one of those occasional films which generates far more controversy than anything on screen justifies. It won't impress the well read, the ideas are nowhere near as brilliant or learned as many claim. Fair warning: for many this movie will be the first blush with concepts millennia old. In the excitement they'll take affront to any criticism. When reading these reviews recall many considered the conceptual adaptation of Plato's Cave in 'The Matrix' profound too. History professor John Oldman is dismayed when his plan to skip out on a prized tenureship for a new life is temporarily sidetracked by a handful of close colleagues who arrive at his home for an impromptu send off. A bottle of Johnnie Walker Green, a comforting fire and the prodding of concerned friends eventually convince him to open up and reveal what drives him to abandon a brilliant and rewarding future without goodbye. The rest of the film is a living room discussion of and challenge to his explanation, John's claim to have been born in pre-history and moving every ten years before it becomes apparent he never ages.Whatever interest the film creates in examining that claim rides almost entirely on its attention to the small details of educated discourse and David Lee Smith's convincing portrayal of Oldman. He hits just the right balance of compassion, detachment and weariness to convince without revealing if the tale is true. Tony Todd also lends much needed support as his skeptical scientific friend excited at the prospect. (It's great to see him in a role that doesn't involve malevolent spirits or serial killers.) Unfortunately, even with well over five hundred shared IMDb Filmography entries the remaining cast give surprisingly uneven and over-the-top performances. That, along with overwrought direction and an unconvincing script, consign this movie to also-ran status. After a promising start focused on the nature of history and evidence it appears the writers lose confidence in the concept of a fourteen thousand year old man holding your interest. A love story gets folded in. From humble beginnings as a plains hunter John claims increasingly improbable and extraordinary experiences, including contact with pivotal figures of art and history, presence at pivotal events in history, and finally culminating with a claim of being perhaps the most pivotal figure of history. Things quickly go off the rails. From detached skepticism and concern for his sanity his erudite audience grows increasingly irrational and emotional in reverse proportion to the probability of John's claims. As the evening progresses Oldman's tale becomes more convincing than their reactions. Eventually one breaks down in tears over a claim regarding their religion, another pulls a gun for no coherent reason. The penultimate scene in which the film reveals the true nature of Oldman's birth hinges on a final unnecessary improbability of staggering proportions. Little past the midpoint rings probable or likely, it ends in a shambles. Still, for an indie movie that's essentially ninety minutes of living room banter something clicks in spite of the generally flawed acting and unbelievable script. It won't change your life any more than 'The Matrix' did, but it's worth a rent if you're the religiously tolerant kind in the mood for something different.",The Man from Earth

They sit in a room for the entire duration of the movie (87 minutes). They are all teachers. and their approach on that 1 guy's story is that of a mediocre 16 year old kid. They are all dull and so is the room. Their acting is also dull, and so is the technical aspect of the ""movie"" - dull image, dull camera moves, dull lighting, dull sound, dull costumes, etc. There was no directing that i noticed.This ""movie"" is so badly made from start to finish.

236,jamesnicolay,Thought-provoking!,10,18 April 2008,"At his farewell dinner, history professor John Oldman asked a ridiculous question to his colleagues in the university: is it possible for a cave man to still exist in the world today? Being intellectuals, of course, they disagreed while keeping an open mind and telling him that nothing is really impossible. But when he mentioned that what if he were to tell them that he had been rubbing elbows with Christopher Columbus, Van Gogh, and even the Buddha himself and that he had stopped aging when he was 35 and that he had been in this world for 14,000 years, every single one of them embarked on an philosophical/psychological/religious/intellectual journey that shook the very foundations of everything they had believed in.Written by one of the best writers of ""Twilight Zone"" and ""Star Trek,"" Emerson Bixby's script of The Man from Earth could not have fallen into better hands than independent or non- Hollywood filmmakers. This sci-fi movie does not have any special effects, audio or visual, no computer-generated animations, but it does nurture the very core of a brilliant science fiction: a resounding and masterly constructed what-if story. The story moves through the discussions among these so-called experts in the university as they question or try to refute the possibility of a self-confessed cavemen who has survived hundreds of millennia. Evoking their reactions, from utter disgust to awe and wonder to emotional outburst, Professor John Oldman's character tells his story with a brick face, casually expressing his past and his thoughts and reflections on history. He tells them truths that rocked the very core of their lives.The movie triumphs in its witty dialogue and very impressive cross-cultural juxtaposition of various moments of history and religion. Anyone who loves intellectual conversations will definitely be drawn to the arguments presented in the film. At the same time, it is probably inevitable that many will also be offended, particularly those who have rigid and firm religious beliefs and those who take everything too seriously and literally. I have always been drawn to films filled with conversations on strange ideas, most especially if the films pose a threat to the social construct or to what the general public assumes as acceptable and irrevocable. I find it amazing how a trifle such as a movie can change how one sees the world. This film is definitely one of these films: a simple story to be reckoned with.",The Man from Earth

The Man From Earth pretty much plays out in the main room of Dr John Oldman's house (and just outside) as he prepares to move on. Unable to fully or satisfactorily tell his friends why he is going or where, he decides to explain himself and he does so by telling them a story that initially seems preposterous to everyone, but gradually at the very least, brings their mind-sets into question. I was engrossed in this film from the moment the story began, as it is of a concept that raises so many questions, most of which are touched upon. Ingeniously, the validity of John Oldman's story is never really clear; we think it is and then something happens to open the question yet again. On that point, for me, it parallels the movie K-Pax in which Kevin Spacey's brilliant portrayal of an alien called Prot, is supposedly proved to be a delusion... but then something happens right at the end to leave it an open question. Was he telling the truth or not? We are left to decide for ourselves. Sheer genius; and both films are definitely on my favourites list.",The Man from Earth

244,dreaujyc,The game of mind,10,14 December 2007,"I ran into this film when I was boring. Tips said we shouldn't expect any popular scene as we usually saw on the film. I just wondered why this kind of movie was filed into science fiction.It is all about a story, which has enormous anthropological，biological and archaeological knowledge. Under most circumstance this kind of movie won't be attractive at all.Like <12 angry men>, most of the movie was set in a house, conversations happened near a fireplace。 If I were the director, I would desperately do my best on the lines，because I couldn't offer any other things to keep audience in the couch. What I didn't expect was that Prof. ""Oldman"" posed such an amazing question: what would happen if you could live for ten thousand years. I asked some of my friends about this question, some were confused, and others just doubted that if I was mentally disordered. So it was really a tough job to analyze this topic, after an impossible assumption. We could really do a lot of things to make us happy or regretted, for we had endless of time. But we could also do nothing for we had endless of time, why hurry? We delayed things tomorrow and nothing bad would happen, in all ,we can wait, just let time do it.This film might have religious points of view which I am not familiar with, and someone may disagree with those things, but using the imagination as we are watching the movie over the assumption of immortality can bring us lots of fun. Just suppose if I could once work with Confucius or any greatest emperor of China or Rome or any other countries, I would be part of history. My people would remember me as an hero although they didn't realize that I was just around. One can look further if he could stand higher, some man who lives forever might develop the truth or natural philosophy which everybody believes.The limit of life may do the only good thing to us that time pushes us forward, we can't wait until tomorrow. The threat of death generates vast number of changes, some are good, and some are the worst. The man from the earth gives us so many surprises; even some imagination can drive people crazy.

245,TerrificTom,Not Science Fiction. A Fantasy Tale,4,14 May 2018,"I was intrigued by the bare synopsis and the reviews here. So I watched it and overall I was disappointed in it.First off, it's not science fiction. There was no science in it at all. It had a fantastical premise we are asked to believe just because it might be possible biological gobbledy gook, blah, blah, liver, cells regenerate, yada yada yada. ""Blah, blah"" and ""gobbledy gook"" do not science fiction make. The premise of the story was fantasy.But that's fine. Nothing wrong with fantasy. But the story lost me when it began talking about somethings I do know a lot about, and that's Religion, the Bible, Jesus, and Christianity. Suddenly this isn't just a story about a guy claiming to be 14,000 years old. Now this is a movie about a guy claiming to be perhaps the most important figure in all of recorded human history. And guess what? Everything people think they know and believe about him is wrong and the most pivotal figure in the history of Western civilization is only pivotal and important because, Oops! everybody around him got it all wrong! And here you sit with him as he's telling his friends how badly history screwed up his story and how he never intended anyone to start a world religion.What frustrated me the most is, any first year student of apologetics could easily dismantle everything he was saying but this movie didn't give anyone that chance. The only person who was personally affected by his alleged ""revelation"" could not offer even one rational, historical, or philosophical reply to the truly outrageous claims he was making. THAT was frustrating.Anyway, I don't want to get into all the minutia of apologetics while reviewing a movie. This is a review after all.

Rather, these themes are to be deduced as 'questionable' rather than 'fictional'.For many viewers, the difference between what is certainly possible and what is probably not will be very distinguished. In addition, you may also feel that this film almost renders itself as an intermediate of your own conceivable reality - you just never knew how to express it. For these sort of viewers, such as myself, this film is a delight to watch. It is captivating, expressive, thought-provoking, and will have the same tears you shed in brief sadness become tears of joy before you are able to wipe them away.The Man From Earth has a very basic and stoic plot that is remarkably powerful due to the gravity of the themes that are addressed. At its core, this film simple and organic, but that hardly means it will be perceived as such. Just as anything in life, this movie will be subject to each of our own 'filters' as our minds find their own ways of dealing with it.The Man from Earth is a replica of its own conjurations. And whether the creators intended such irony or not, it is without a doubt what makes it so poetic.",The Man from Earth

With the theatrical setting and good dialog, it took its time to burn its quiet significance into my mind. This film is a cultural achievement, if not necessary for syfy genre, then rather for crossing between philosophy and theology, both being the belief systems. A movie for non-believers, believers, fervent believers, agnostics, atheists, know-it-betters, know-it-all-ers. What would you want , as a human, out of the entirety of human experience?

Considering the ""hated"" reviews, it is acceptable that it may be too harsh since it mostly criticize the concepts which many people take granted for and believe in. And yes, since it is not a ""paper"" or a ""thesis"" on social sciences, it may not project the absolute ""historical"" facts. But, the gist is always there and the transfer to the audience is well managed . And the film is really courageous considering that the audience may be anyone.

You might laugh but it will be at it certainly not with.Maybe somewhere at some point there was a mildly interesting point or idea here but it gets lost within a script which would work well as a school play but no more.

This is a classical science-fiction film which all happened in a living room, and that should thanks for the wonderfully talented script.Like I said, this is a science-fiction film, but you won't find any computer animation or any other science fiction related scenes in it, because all they do is nothing but talking and debating in a regular living room throughout the movie, yet it can still make you feel like watching a pure science-fiction film, and how's that? Everyone should watch the movie and find out for yourself.Of course some people might disagree with me, and regard the movie as a religious film. I believe that is another way to describe the film. Nonetheless, I sure appreciate the enthusiasm and tension that this film brought me, which let me believe that, with a great story, you won't need any special effects to make a film successful at all.",The Man from Earth

That's the start premise, and it's OK, we just wait for the logical consequences. The whole movie consists of a long session of questions by his friends, all of them scientists. My two questions to the writer. First: How could he get an academic degree? Since the Paleolithic he is too old for a formal education. Second: He's not immortal, so he could die in accidents, wars or plagues. 14.000 years is a lot of time, you have to be very cautious to not to suffer any visible misfortune.

I'd rather hear other things from someone who lived for so long than religion and Jesus. The premise is extremely weak not to mention implausible that I had to roll my eyes more than a couple of times. The fact that anyone would believe this guy without proof was beyond annoying.I found so many contradictions and things that didn't make sense that I am surprised it wasn't listed in the goof section on this site. No surprise because apparently this movie could do no wrong.For one Jesus was born, a man didn't just come around and said I am 'Jesus' he was a baby than he grew up. As for Buddha this didn't make sense at all because they kept a lot of records about Buddha and no where have I read that he taught some white man named Jesus. I guess the western nation doesn't realize or chooses to ignore this fact but this was so teeth grindingly annoying that I had to stop watching it.Was so bad that I couldn't even finish the film.",The Man from Earth

Great actors, although they only have to talk with there mouths and body. Just body talk and standard talk were enough to make this movie become supernatural. It's amazing that this story without special effects, without breathtaking stunts, car chases, special fights etc can make people ""glued"" to the screen. I must say I like special effects. But nowadays aren't we looking for just this type of stories. We are overdone with stunning special effects.... it's standard now. The characters were all played well, also the unbelief of the woman that he also was Jezus (in this story). Each character was different, but they all are (were) friends...

257,dsntxst,A divisive but thought-provoking sci-fi drama,7,5 March 2014,"As with other reviewers I was suckered into seeking out this film by the high praise and intriguing premise. By the end I wasn't sure if I could say I enjoyed it - but it did make me think for a long time afterwards and for that it certainly warrants praise.Yes, the film wears its low budget on its sleeve with its single setting, questionable set dressing (I know the main character lived in a cabin and was supposed to be moving away but still...) and hideous wardrobe. Yes, the characters are grossly stereotyped and the acting is quite stilted at times. And yes, the vast majority of the film consists of people (even worse, ""intellectual"" people) sitting in a room talking and the most vigorous piece of action is when the removalists take the furniture away (or when the psychologist goes into cardiac arrest, take your pick).But damnit... I couldn't help but be drawn into the story that unfolded over the course of the film's runtime. It was preposterous, fantastical, cringe-worthy, wonderful, woeful, thoughtful and clumsy all at the same time. It stuck in my head for a few days afterwards... and (damnit again) it made me think! I can't honestly say I got ""enjoyment"" from watching this film - but it tickled something in the recesses of my brain that didn't go away. If only more films could be so affecting.Thoughtful sci-fi should make you reflect on the outrageous situation/s it presents and how this may apply to our modern day lives, for better or worse. Forgive this film its technical limitations and I am certain you will get something similar out of it.",The Man from Earth

I will not mark this a spoiler, because there simply is nothing to spoil. Nothing happens. People sit around in a room and talk about a silly idea. And while this could also describe one extremely good movie with intense inter-character dynamics like ""Carnage"", this one is exactly on the opposite end of the spectrum.

This movie is no exception for that thumb rule. Most of the casts are just perfect to their portions. And this should be really mentioned here that none of them have overdone their part. That is the most important thing in this type of movie with lots of argument and conversation.I never thought a film can be captured in a single house without boring like this.

262,garythemessage,Science Fiction? Not at All. Just Fiction.,4,25 November 2007,"Man, after the first 20 minutes I had a hundred stumpers to ask this guy, and I'm to believe that all these college professors couldn't come up with anything? I barely passed high school, and I certainly don't have any degrees, but I could have easily produced some trickier responses to the nutcase in the film. Oh, and at no time did I feel like this guy was 14,000 years old. And the acting was poor all the way around - with no exceptions for anyone. Here's a sample of questions the ""professors"" could have asked:""Do you have dentures?"" Teeth do not regenerate, so a 14,000 year old man wouldn't have a single trace of a tooth left. They would have rotted, or at least worn away. If this guy has any of his own teeth - he's a fake. It would have been one of my first questions.*******SPOILER******** *******SPOILER******** *******SPOILER******** If this dude was Jesus, speak me some Aramaic. Hell, give me 4 or 5 idioms in Aramaic. Those goobers didn't ask him to speak any languages, they weren't even curious. He would have known dozens of dead languages, and known them intimately. So, give me 4 or 5 idioms in 4 or 5 dead languages. Hell, language should have kept them bastards busy for hours and days. They could have stumped that faker a million times. But, no, they let him off the hook for some reason.Oh, and the biggest question to ask, ""Did you learn a language in your first few years of life?"" Science has long known that the part of the brain that controls speech must be developed very early in childhood. The study of feral children has proved repeatedly that they are unable to learn language beyond a handful of words, certainly not enough to form complex sentences or to get multiple degrees and teach college. By ascertaining if this cavedude learned a complex language in the beginning or not, well, everything would hinge on that. If his caveman language was only a system of grunts and not complex sentences, his brain would never be able to learn Latin or Greek, or any other language.See? Them be some real ""science"" questions, and the director totally avoided all traces of science. Indeed, throughout the entire movie everyone admitted that they stuck to the history books. History books are not science, thus this movie is not science fiction. It is something a child would have come up with, but only a child who hadn't given it much thought.There's tons of other things that could have made this charlatan ""cave"" in. I felt his constant excuses were very flimsy - he simply couldn't remember much of anything. Except being Jesus, of course. And that's what this movie ultimately ends being about. It's simply a jab at Christianity. Whoopty doo. I don't find jabbing a particular religion sufficient to make a movie worth watching. It certainly didn't cover up the poor research and amateur acting.Watch this if you're a boring person who doesn't think for himself/herself, and especially if you want to see Christianity debunked via a poorly worked bit of fiction.",The Man from Earth

I didn't really know what to expect from this movie, and didn't have any expectations. If you have not seen it, know that you are getting yourself into something very intellectual that is closer to a book than a movie. The reason I give this movie 6 out of 10 is because of the direction the movie took. I thought it to be very interesting, but at the same time very out there and slightly insulting. I do not have a problem with movies that question religion, but I do have a problem when movies make Christians out to be the uneducated, close-minded, and ""faith-only"" kind of people.

265,michalgill,The best movie judging by the price-quality ratio,10,20 August 2013,"To me this is probably the best movie there is and let me tell you why: For those of you who know me (mostly probably from my reviews on Czecho- Slovak alternative to IMDb) it is long time known that the most important thing on every movie or TV show are not the actors, directors, crew and lots of money pumped into the set, but always number one on my list is script, close second is script again and third would be the book by which the script is written (if there is any). This film simply have the best script there is thanks to great work of late Jerome Bixby. It is so short, so simple, written just for handful of actors and yet it's so brilliant in it's originality, complexity and ability to chain one to the screen from start straight to the end, that no other movie can be even compared to it. Not to sound like I underestimate the work of the rest of crew and cast, let me just say that all of these people did a really great job of putting late Mr. Bixby's lines on the silver screen, it surely could have been even better, but there is no eleventh star on IMDb. The casting is simply great, no superstars, but very well known faces that any cinema-geek knows quite well, great director Richard Schenkman and judging by his blog also great crew.

269,Sparse,A Single Conversation with Countless Ideas,9,9 June 2017,"The Man from Earth is based on a screenplay conceived by Jerome Bixby and completed shortly before his passing. About a decade later, the film went into production. This movie is for anyone who loves sci-fi, or just thought-provoking texts in general.This sci-fi fantasy is one of my favorite films, but is really more of a conversation than a film. It explores various topics and ideas, and will keep you engaged and interested. As a film however (from a production standpoint), it's far from perfect.The cinematography and direction are fine. The video and audio quality are just OK. The acting is a little shaky, sometimes distractingly. The music is serviceable, though isn't necessarily anything special. Overall, it's not very impressive from a technical angle. Considering the layers of inquiry central to the film, there's a lot more that could have been done from a directorial standpoint. To the director's credit though, the film holds up well considering the low budget and the fact that it takes place almost entirely in a single room. To most people that would seem pretty boring, but The Man from Earth manages to be both interesting and engaging, with no small amount of help from the screenplay. It's the writing that I love it for (in fact, it's actually been adapted into a play, which seems more fitting).The Man from Earth was written by Jerome Bixby, who worked as a writer on both Star Trek and The Twilight Zone (two of the most influential sci-fi works in history), and what made those shows compelling is just as present in The Man from Earth. This film explores multiple ideas, but this time through a single conversation: what if a man could survive from the prehistoric era to modern day?At first, that seems like kind of a silly question. It's actually where the ""fantasy"" in ""sci- fi fantasy"" comes in, but they take this concept a long way. This conversation is an introspective reflection on history—an exploration of perception itself. As we listen to the main character speak, we get a sense of how the time and space around him not only affect what he perceives, but how he perceives it. It's basically saying that our circumstances are not only what we perceive, but our circumstances shape how we perceive it. It's very cyclical, and endlessly fascinating—not unlike principles of language. It's the exploration of these subjects that help The Man from Earth classify not only sci-fi, but propel it to among the best the genre has to offer.There are also some rather fascinating deconstructions on religion. This includes new how religions borrow from past religions, and successive denial of borrowing at all. It also explores how someone's view of religion would be shaped after seeing so many religions come and go. Between the themes of living (essentially) forever and coping with death, the thoughts over religion fit right in.There's a subplot or two that feels unnecessary, but overall it's a very interesting movie, with a handful of quotable lines even. The Man from Earth: Holocene is coming up very soon, and though I'm VERY skeptical that this sequel is necessary (or could even be good), I'll give it a chance. (Also it's got Michael Dorn so whoooo!) I recommend this film to anyone who is a science-fiction fan, or just likes movies that make you think.Score: 9/10",The Man from Earth

Astonishingly, it appears to have been made on somebody's pocket change. With the decent cast and screenplay, it shows that SF as idea and concept can be mesmerizing. As opposed to what we usually get when a well thought-through SF story is translated to the screen: an 'A' budget thrown at what is rendered as a grade 'Z' story.

Dealing in absolutes is equally silly in both directions. Bottom line, this film is absurd, illogical, horribly written, terribly acted and ultimately, sinfully arrogant. Militant liberals will love it of course, hence the ""rave"" reviews in contrast to my otherwise humble, perhaps more centered and calm observation. I too hate annoying CGI as well as any nonsensical dramatization atop what might otherwise be a good flick by written merit alone, but here, I would have taken shaky-cam + computer generated dinosaurs fighting with 8-legged aliens in middle-earth over this. It's that bad, just in the opposing direction on the scale of extremities. Those who might find this entertaining have failed to understand which books in life are a must read, although they have certainly read many of the nonsensical ones. I'm, sure! Simple as that. Details? No spoilers here, but imagine you and a small group of friends get REALLY stoned, and then gather in a room to discuss what might be the groundbreaking answer to why your mouth makes noises when you move your lips and push air between them, and such that others are able to then understand said noises and reply in kind, in the end, the entire group reaching a consensus that they have discovered the answer to human communication and the means by which to bridge all obstacles of such.

I liked that The Man from Earth was pretty much shot entirely in one room because I think that can be effective if the story is really strong, but unfortunately this story went a bit wrong.I actually liked the premise of the film - combined with the setting and sparse cast it definitely did have a Twilight Zone vibe but then it simply got too silly with all the daft historical name dropping. And the 'twist' at the end could of been played out so much better.But, on a positive note, the gallop through the last 14,000 years was pretty cool and I did like John's monologues about his life. I liked the low budget, no CGI, no action vibe. And I can't have hated it that much cos I do quite want to watch the sequel (which looks like its got loads of action sequences).",The Man from Earth
281,daytamod-38118,"Intellectual, engrossing, captivating",10,30 January 2018,"When you've seen a movie an untold number of times you know you're hooked. I am hooked on this movie for so many reasons. I've never really come across anything like it. Eight actors, in one location talking about whether or not a man is 14,000 years old. The way it grabs you in from a very early stage and intrigues you with the very thought of it.The actors for me do a superb job of keeping your interest in the subject. Some parts feel a little wooden but I liked the line-up chosen for the movie and I think they worked well together to keep you intrigued. You can relate to the reactions of any one of them, or you are enticed to draw your own conclusion on how you would react, but you are encouraged to make your decisions on the topics and revelations that arise.As well as the wonderful acting, the enticing storyline by Jerome Bixby, I love the music arrangement from Mark Hinton Stewart. The music for me supports the scenes beautifully.All in all, a great sci-fi movie, and without one hint of CGI anywhere. This is one I will continue to watch for a very long time. Love it.",The Man from Earth
282,Cris_Drg,Not So Great,4,12 September 2009,"The premise is very promising, and so are the chosen characters. The problem may have been the limited imagination and intelligence of the writers who could only do so much.The story development is simple-minded and lacks depth. The acting is bad, and the lack of character-depth doesn't help either. It's hard to accept that a bunch of university professors have such a limited understanding of life; any complex issues are 'clerverly' avoided. Like mentioning Buddha in one phrase as 'the wisest man I've met"" and then moving on fast. It seems a big deal, when in fact it's just smoke.While the lack of emotional content may be somehow explainable for the man who's lived 14000 years, the lack of emotional content of the whole film can only be explained by the fact that the writers are merely browsing. They could not decide what's important and what's not.This premise deserves better treatment - it deserves better, smarter writers. I can only imagine what it could become.This film - is not worth it. This is all you need to know: ""what if a man would live for 14,000 years? what would he be like?""",The Man from Earth

The only way you could find ""Man from Earth"" intellectual is if you consider any movie intellectual that stretches half an idea over 90 minutes but does not have any explosions in it.Seriously: This must have been the most absurdly over-rated movie that I have ever watched. The point of the movie is clear from the beginning and it does noting more than tell a campfire story, without even having the decency of leaving out the actual campfire.The acting is wooden, to say the least. I wouldn't remember the last movie where I saw an actor illustrate a heart attack with such a ridiculous pose. And that's only one example.I have a horrible suspicion: Could it be that the fact, that ""Jesus"" is being depicted in this movie, switches a little flick in some viewers' brains, eradicating any possibility to not like this movie?

The movies which leave you thinking are the best ones and it is one of them.
I really loved the plot, script ,direction everything was perfect except the acting , i think casting could have been better. The way the movie starts with a slow pace and gradually takes the shape of a fast thriller ,amused me.
The way everything was explained so expertly and smoothly was great.

288,kozansahin,Don't get fooled by the high rating. Let me explain:,5,24 May 2012,"IMDb ratings are useful but OF COURSE, if you know how to read them!First of all, viewers who allow their time to sign up and rate the movies must be considered as above average viewer. Therefore ratings on IMDb have a certain value. But still, the population of IMDb includes a dispersion and you should understand how people tend to rate based on this fact.1) Big productions with an original script (or a revolutionary technique as SC cam as in Avatar) and a topnotch cast would go up to IMDb's Top list and they would probably deserve it. Look at that list and in general you'll see the master pieces of the cinema history.2) Big productions with a well-crafted script and a good cast would definitely have a rating above 7 from numerous users like 50000 people or something like that. According to your taste of genre, you won't be disappointed by these films most of the time. 3) An indie film with a low budget, a good or an original (or as it seems that way at the first look) script and an unknown cast would have a rating above 7 from a comparatively lower number of users like 20000 or so. This 3rd case is the tricky one. If your time is valuable, you should take some time to read some reviews and make up your mind. Because in cases like these (like The Man From Earth here) when average educated people with an average intelligence see this kind of film THEY THINK that they're so intellectual and special and THEY FEEL like they're above the rest of the human kind and THEY ARE the first and the only ones who understand the false concept of things like religion and stuff, THEY GIVE a 9 or 10 to a poorly made movie with a poorly written script and awful acting!!!Be aware!For this movie my rating is 5. And that is for the nice effort on a low budget and the success on reaching so many people. I should give 1 to compensate the over-raters though!",The Man from Earth

So a few teachers get together to bid farewell to one of the colleague and in the spare time while he is packing they start chit chat and the movie takes off from there. The actors, their expression, little science input here and there all of them were truly brilliant. This movie left me with awe and I have been trying to find a similar movie since then but have failed to do so cause its a one of a kind movie.This is by far the best movie I have watched and if you have watched it and liked it (obviously !!) then spread the word and let your friends and family watch cause you don't want them to miss out on this.",The Man from Earth

But still it will keep you wandering more than some of the costlier and more famous movies of this genre .The acting could have been better .

Lucky for me, I was able to comprehend the movie even with English subtitles. I didn't expect much, but ended up having one of the greatest movie experiences of my entire life.David Lee Smith plays a man who claims to be quite a bit older than you might expect. So much in fact that he has lived on Earth for a whopping 10 000 years. The main focus of the movie is: how do we relate to unexpected and surprising information that conflicts with our present understanding of the world and humanity? How tight are we locked inside that box of ours? Without giving away the story, I'd like to point out that only one of the guests was able to bypass his personal egoistic evaluations and asses the situation in itself: not blindly believing what was told, but not dismissing the information either before carefully evaluating the situation.An open mind with an open heart. A great example for other to follow during these times when the internet has polarized everyone's opinions. This, accompanied with wonderful acting, captive drama, and sympathetic characters, is what makes this movie great. In the end you don't even care whether its true or not what has been told: the main focus is the drama, the reactions, and the philosophical and epistemological question of how much do we really even know of what is possible and what is not.Best movie of the century so far. 10/10.",The Man from Earth

This is not a film you watch with a group of friends and a six pack.It demands your complete attention,it pulls you into the room with the assembled cast so you are sitting there with them,open mouthed at this most incredible story.I have seen at least ten multi million dollar blockbuster movies this year that have left me literally angry with disappointment.Yet here is a low budget,practically no budget film, with only eight people in it, set almost entirely in one small room,and it was one of the most satisfying and gripping films I have seen for several years.A picture is worth a thousand words,but several hundred words strung together in an intelligent and articulate way are worth a million CGI effects.Pour yourself a glass of your favourite drink,open your mind,and be taken on a mind trip of epic proportions.I really can not get this film out of my head at the moment.Just amazing.",The Man from Earth

I could write about this movie for hours and still not say enough, but I will leave it at this: If you even REMOTELY enjoyed any of the above, you absolutely HAVE GOT TO SEE THIS FILM. Even though I downloaded it (a technique I use to weed out the myriad of fodder films to find the true masterpieces), I will be buying it the moment I can afford to, and will doubtless pass the word on to many, MANY more people from here on out.Even though I wasn't even remotely excited about burning this to DVD and then putting it on to watch during a random solo movie session, I am now full of hope after having seen it, and am extremely overjoyed that I was lucky enough to have found this.

299,atlasredux,Nice story ... yet ....,8,18 November 2008,"I find the movie a tad overrated. Yes, it brings up philosophical issues, but nothing else that hasn't been brung up before or discussed almost every year by your friends. Immortality, religion, morales, imagination ... it's just done with a different twist. Immortality is already proved, it is our own genes that are killing us with our own gene-codes to prevent overpopulation and endorse evolution. We just haven't found the key to make it work yet. But HERE the movie takes a good issue : the morality of immortality. Too sad there was way too little on that matter. The rest is mainly old conversations / ideas we all have thought through at one point or another, unless you've never read a book. However, it was beautifully told and I really promote any movie that is entirely about philosophy and does it well, despite some of the ideas has been done to death, just with a twist. All in all ... with some minor changes, I would have given the story a 10 ... 2 points off for too many clichès and not ENDING the movie philosophically! Should have left it open ...

302,dnavin-2,Tell a lie enough times and people will start to believe it,1,20 September 2008,"'Tell a lie enough times and people will start to believe it' The Anti-Christian brigade seems to follow this mantra of the Nazis. First Da Vinci and now this?It seems to be in fashion these days to abuse a religion. Outside Hollywood it's Islam and in Hollywood it's Christianity. While am not against a healthy debate, it's time for Hollywood script writers to think outside the box. Perhaps that's what the writer of this movie is doing right now in heaven(or hell perhaps).The film is an insult esp. to the Christians in Asia & Middle East whose faith in Jesus hasn't moved despite the large scale prosecution in recent times. Indian Christians themselves are facing the worst ever anti-Christian riots by the Hindus.Some people here say only fundamentalist will oppose this movie but then what's the need to make a quick buck by abusing the sentiments of thousands('cause thankfully only that many people must have seen this movie.) The film itself is quite engrossing and hence i'd given it a 7 but I was totally turned off by the protagonist claiming to be Jesus and reduced it to 1.It's also an strange coincidence that the protagonist was always present at all the imp. historical times. I had to say 'aww...come on' & laugh when he claimed to meet Buddha but then he drops this bomb that he's Jesus.

303,nevdelap,Very good. Probably not what you're expecting.,9,31 January 2014,"I think a lot of the reviewers who have rated this movie lowly have done so for a few of principle reasons. 1/ they see a ""Sci-Fi"" movie with an 8 rating and a lot of 10 reviews and think it will be something to rival Avatar, 2/ they aren't expecting something that is more like a stage play than an feature film, and 3/ a lot of religious people will think it is offensive for the usual ""looking for a reason to be offended"" reasons.The Man from Earth is almost entirely set in a single room, and is a conversation among a group of people. Some of the acting, mainly at the beginning is weak, though in a ""they should have re-shot it"" sense, because for most of the movie it is much better, but like you'd see in a theater production, rather than a high production values block buster. The subject matter is intelligent, touches on many aspects of philosophy, theology, science, and history. It is thoughtful and well written, and I don't know why it has the label ""Sci-Fi"" attached to it at all.It's not a Shawshank Redemption by any means, but it is very good, if you don't go into it expecting it to be something it isn't.

Its almost unbearable. If you watch the movie put yourself into any of the listening character's place, imagine what you would feel in their place and you can see how silly their responses are. Just think, people. It's silly. Granted, the idea for the story is good. A man who doesn't age and can give his unique perspective on history as he knew it, that's a neat idea, but the people in this movie just don't act like real people. Here's how real people act: my friend says he is 14,000 years old, I say he's silly, he explains stuff, I listen, I think he's silly or I believe him. The end.

However, as a New Testament scholar, I had to laugh at a lot of ignorant and outdated arguments. Same as Peter Joseph's Zeitgeist, this was a rehearsal of the 18th & 19th century theologians' ideas that hardly any serious NT scholar, atheist or theist, has retained in the second half of the 20th century.

Until the last minute, I was not sure what to make of it. But then, when the final credits came up, I could just - laugh.I am a bit surprised that most comments take this movie for a serious Sci-Fi movie. Admittedly: the plot is not that bad, the dialogues are entertaining (even though they are trying a bit too hard to be intellectual and witty), and it seems to make sense somehow - but then the story gets so exaggerated that it just draws the whole film down to ridiculous.There are (at least) two points which deprive the movie of all its credibility, so you just can't take it seriously any more: the role the protagonist claims to have played in the bible age, and the role of the psychiatrist. Until this point, you can still follow the line, enjoying the discussion of the characters involved; but then - the whole plot gets blown into pieces by that absolutely absurd and ridiculous statement, which is too nonsense to make you actually think and too cheap to actually make you laugh.I can, for the life of me, not see in what respect this movie could be considered intellectual. It is based on one interesting idea, but doesn't make much of it and leaves you wondering why you just spent your precious time on a half-baked fantasy story.

It is not everyday that a movie can give you the same experience of the theater and the self- visualization of reading a novel. The movie introduces colorful characters with various beliefs and insights portrayed by some fresh, classic acting skills. David Lee was the right choice to play John Oldman, who is definitely a character of intrigue. He conveys the wisdom of a man alive for over a millennium, but still gives the performance of a man who is giving a performance of a man alive for over a millennium.Being a Christian man, I was taken aback by the reference to Christ. But not being an ignorant fool and with my appreciation for art, I got over it.

Just people having one of the most interesting conversation of all. This movie is so fascinating because, you can't as pointed out in the film, not say if it's true or not. You can't prove, nor disapprove it. I don't know what to believe, and I think that is the point of the movie, leaving the audience torn apart. The movie got me hypnotized and not once was I distracted. Not by my phone, not by being bored. Just simple attention for straight 85 minutes. That is indeed, fantastic.It is very much worth a watch, and I hope everyone enjoys it as much as I did and still do. I can't believe this film has been overseen, I mean it is a hard movie to get. It's not sold many places. Good thing we can stream (rent) films, now a days. I am completely blown away by the level of intelligence this movie is on.

I did not shed tears, nor was the message a revelation of some sorts due to my background in studies of different religions as well as interest in neuroscience. What moved me was both the story itself as well as the acting and direction. This film has no action, no plot, it relies on dialog and the connection between the characters. John Oldman reveals to his colleagues that he is by some unknown miracle 14000 years old. Is John playing a hoax? Is he for real? His friends and colleagues try to presume neither, but approach it critically, analytical and objective. However there is just so much objectivity one can manage before one's personal feelings get in the way.The Man From Earth is not a film about religion, nor science, nor the possibility of a correlation between them. It does not take a stance for either. It is a film about humanity, about people. It is a true humanistic film at its core; humanistic ethics, stripped down to the bare simple truths about life right here, right now. It is not a film in the high standards of Tarkovsky, Bergman, Kurosawa to receive a top rating, yet I am still giving it a 10. The pacing was fantastic, all the characters displayed warmth and were equally sympathetic, the direction and photography while not original and extraordinary was perfect for telling this story. There are no hidden mysteries that are revealed, you won't find from it the meaning of life. But perhaps it will inspire you to find your personal meaning of life.",The Man from Earth

From the moment I turned it on, I was enthralled with this complex film.It's not special effects or action that enthralled me. The script in this film is phenomenal, the characters diverse and real. It challenges the viewer and the characters and the beliefs they hold dear, and I've never had a science fiction film actually make me wonder if it could be real. I'm not sure of the validity of the science, but it certainly was strong enough to make me ask questions. The Man from Earth questions humanity's core beliefs; religion and our concept of mortality and the supernatural.I was amazed to find even my 13 year old brother enjoyed this film.

It is VERY noticeable that this is a budget movie. Bad casting, bad acting, crappy background props/environment, bad soundtrack - just like The Stand.But the story is AMAZING, and unlike The Stand's post-apocalypse setting, should apply to everyone.

It's a VERY dialogue heavy movie, which is not for everyone, but if you loved movies like 12 Angry Men, My Dinner with Andre, Glengarry Glenross, The Breakfast Club, The King's Speech, or others similar, then you'll appreciate this movie a lot. I can't believe so few people know about it. It's filmed on a shoestring budget, so probably didn't have much distribution or marketing, but it blew away my expectations.",The Man from Earth
315,MadMax-47,No sense of story at all,3,26 July 2015,"This film is the perfect expression of old school science fiction.There are a lot of knowledgeable people, who spend the movie talking and debating. Remember, when you were in High School, how you'd sit around and wonder about things like ""What would have happened if you invented a time machine, went back in time, and your parents had never met?"" This is the same kind of stuff. There's precious little human interaction and motivation, just a scientific exploration of an interesting concept that's never developed as human experience.I'm not saying I have to have Independence Day, but just some changes of scenery for the pretentious dialog would have been an improvement.",The Man from Earth

The acting is just awful. Reminded me of a bunch of amateurs at some rinkydink theater and I actually felt uncomfortable and embarrassed for them!

317,Brimm62,Very Inteligent and Athmospheric,10,7 May 2019,Extremely enjoyable! After ten minutes it sucks you in and keeps you entertained. The movie was made for people that appreciate intelligence over special effects. Very satisfying ending. I wish it was longer.,The Man from Earth
318,lukas8,Disappointing,4,4 January 2008,"Good science fiction is supposed to entertain a fantastic notion in order to stimulate new perspectives and ideas about humanity and reality. If you are looking for that, then consider a different movie.I watched this movie because of the reviews and ratings here on IMDb. This site doesn't usually let me down, but I have to say that there is no greater discrepancy here between rating and actual quality than there is with The Man from Earth.Have you ever had a professor who obviously considered himself a genius, and also considered himself funny, even though he was plainly the opposite in both cases? Prepare for dejavu if you watch this movie. The humor tries to be intellectual, but I would say it is more like Full House meets The New Yorker. The characters are all so unrealistic and, well, downright unlikable. The acting is awful, just completely bad. It feels like it was made by an atheist who considered himself enlightened, yet the message gets lost in the abysmal story.I won't spoil anything, as if there was some way that could make the movie even worse, but the ending will either make you laugh derisively or shake your head in disbelief over how poorly done it was.The review I read said the movie was for people who are not afraid to think, yet the ideas expressed in between the cheesy one-liners were no more profound than an AOL chatroom discussion about who is greater, pirates or ninjas. Nothing new was said, no ideas reinvented, no original thinking in the whole blathering mess.",The Man from Earth
319,Mindtech,VERY well told story!,9,30 December 2007,"Yes! This movie's got it: A great story. And thank you for not making this a cheesy Hollywood production with the usual cast, mysteriously just out of the hair parlor.The research has been done, a fellow archaeologist and student of the ancient Middle East will know this. The talk is smooth and with plenty logic vs. feel. The believer, the fanatic, the frantic analyst, the disbeliever is present, it's an all-round affair, everyone chips in. I was caught in the middle.I think you need something particular in you to fully enjoy this movie. Some doubt, some faith... a feeling that all in the world is not what it appears to be, and that truth is individual.What does it matter who this guy claims to be? How can you be upset? If something about this movie strikes you, look to yourself - something has been struck! But what? If you're angry, your beliefs have not made it across that river.A few glitches in the polish here and there, and a slight piece of (I feel unjust) self-authority towards the end made this a 9 instead of a 10.

You might or might not like the story. Everyone has a different point of view and angle to approach things and this movie certainly made that very well. I think the story was well told and engaging.

A good primer of the recent history of man.What gets irritating and pretentious are the dialogues. Some of them are plain daft (leave aside the incredulity of the situation.) And OK, i give it to the film- makers for a difficult plot but could have been crafted better. Also, apart from proving/disproving hypothesis of a 14000 year old man, there was no other alluring sign that something more was at play in the situation.Should have actually been a play.

323,smoothtooth,Better than most indie films out there,7,7 November 2007,"Although I had the luxury of skipping over a few minutes of the movie, here and there, I was left feeling this was a grade above the average independent venture we are so used to getting. First of all, the acting was above-par for the obviously tiny budget this project was put together with. I was impressed with a few pro-like pans and close-ups by the cinematographer, and the scene transitions were also quite smooth for the most part. The dialog didn't appear too forced and at times transparently natural. It was enjoyable to watch and I found myself wanting to see it through to the end. This is much more than I can say for a lot of other low-budget flicks out there.On the flip-side, however, was the soundtrack. Other than a small classical interlude played by one of the characters, the viewers must endure a very amateurish performance by whoever that is playing their synthesizer in front of their computer with cheap software. I know these guys don't have the cash to afford the top names in composition, but the music was too often distracting. I found myself focusing on the cheap soft-synths when I should be listening to the excellent banter between the actors.I hate to be so picky when the producers had so little resources, but for the average viewer this might be not the favorite rental DVD. I would recommend it to anyone who is tired of cliché science-fiction and is looking for a stimulating mind-probe. However, don't expect to have your world-view shaken as some other reviewers seem to have experienced.",The Man from Earth
324,natarajanganesan,A brilliant screenplay wasted on a weak plot.,7,4 February 2008,"The movie is essentially a one room act/drama revolving around set of academics that gradually spins out of control over an astounding claim made by one of the academics - that he has been a Cro-magnon human surviving for the past many centuries and that can never die. Greeted with sneers and jeers, the discussion hits the rooftop when he claims his participation in key historic events of mankind. This leads to animated discussions surrounding those events and the viewer is led to a demystification of them by the professor narrating the experience. On one hand the script manages to hold the viewers attention to the last word, while on the other movie suffers from quite a few liberties and under-the-carpet push-over explanations to drive home the main theme. Overall the movie is worth a one time watch and post movie argument on the movie contents.7 for the efforts at screenplay and script and that its an independent movie production.",The Man from Earth

Why? Because they're so bloody insecure in their atheist stupidity that they cant feel good unless everyone else believes the bull that they do.Atheist reviewer ""ian"" even dares tells everyone not to bring religion into the reviews, yet he spends like an hour writing his own patented total ignoramus views on religion himself. Poser.Oh, poor boy, like you would know anything at all about the truth anyway. You even mention Russell's fallacious teapot argument. Amazing.Go suck up to that other atheist drone ignoramus Dawkins - count his stupid & ignorant ""friends"" on that too.. Your atheist high priests of fallacious logic, ridiculously poor historical knowledge, outright fraud and inane drone theories are not required in your own movie ""reviews"".""The atheist risk everything for the present and the future, on the basis of a belief that we are uncaused by any intelligent being. We just happen to be here. That one is willing to live and die in that belief is a very high price to pay for conjecture."" - Ravi Zacharias""To be an atheist requires an indefinitely greater measure of faith than to receive all the great truths which atheism would deny."" - Joseph Addison,The Spectator, Mar. 8, 1711""The habit of arguing in support of atheism, whether it be done from conviction or in pretense, is a wicked and impious practice."" - Marcus Tullius Cicero 106–43 B.C.atheists are for the most part imprudent and misguided scholars who reason badly who, not being able to understand the Creation, the origin of evil, and other difficulties, have recourse to the hypothesis the eternity of things and of inevitability....."" - VoltaireStill, even the most admirable of atheists is nothing more than a moral parasite, living his life based on borrowed ethics. This is why, when pressed, the atheist will often attempt to hide his lack of conviction in his own beliefs behind some poorly formulated utilitarianism, or argue that he acts out of altruistic self-interest. But this is only post-facto rationalization, not reason or rational behavior. -Vox DayA disbelief in God does not result in a belief in nothing; disbelief in God usually results in a belief in anything.""My argument against God was that the universe seemed so cruel and unjust. But how had I got this idea of just and unjust? A man does not call a line crooked unless he has some idea of a straight line. What was I comparing this universe with when I called it unjust? If the whole show was bad and senseless from A to Z, so to speak, why did I, who was supposed to be part of the show, find myself in such violent reaction against it? A man feels wet when he falls into water, because man is not a water animal: a fish would not feel wet. Of course, I could have given up my idea of justice by saying that it was nothing but a private idea of my own. But if I did that, then my argument against God collapsed too -for the argument depended on saying that the world was really unjust, not simply that it did not happen to please my private fancies. Thus in the very act of trying to prove that God did not exist -another words, that the whole of reality was senseless -I found I was forced to assume that one part of reality--namely my idea of justice--was full of sense. Consequently atheism turns out to be too simple. If the whole universe has no meaning, we should never have found out that it has no meaning: just as, if there were no light in the universe and therefore no creatures with eyes, we should never know it was dark. Dark would be without meaning."" - C.S. Lewis =======================Keep your religious slime to yourself Ian or get lost.",The Man from Earth
326,toygun_999,"What apply to others shouldn't apply to us, Think NOT!",5,20 June 2011,"First, let me clarify some of the factual and logical errors occurred in this movie,-John Oldman (the protagonist) mentioned something like he always called himself ""John"" from his youth, i.e. since his prehistoric days in Europe, but that is absurd. The name 'John' is an ancient Middle Eastern name, not European. In Aramaic and Arabic ""John"" is Yeh'ya.-The Christian Bible was written in Aramaic, not Hebrew, as many dull ignorants (religious freaks) think.-Why someone, who lived through a LOT, suddenly wanted to 'dish it out' to people who are not so interesting, or significant after all- from his point of view. I mean the protagonist met far more interesting and influential people in his 14,000 years life time whom might believed him much more readily than these 'intelectuals'; why trying to convince people who may seem just shades of by passers in his near eternal journey. He should know better than anyone on this Earth; he's supper- experienced. What is the point?In addition, the movie is obviously made with some 'anti-religious' flavour, and I noticed many uptight religious freaks (ignorants) can't stand this and there was even one who suggest that had the religion been switched (i.e. Islam) it would have been worth it!As if these ignorants live on a different planet and don't realise that Hollywood, plus outside its domain, had made thousands of movies, documentaries and TV programs bashing other religions (e.g. Islam) and mostly ended in an utter failure and equally absurd conclusion, far more so than this movie did, well these people, of all, should realise how it feels when ones' belief is 'insulted'- it's a b*ch, ain't?'What apply to others shouldn't apply to us', yeah, well that is very ""Christian"" of you.

327,manuelwinchester,"A science fiction offering an alternative, and a hymn to philosophy.",9,2 September 2018,"That was sensational in a few words; a proper science fiction debate instilled in philosophy and critical thinking, and, a thoughtful masterpiece which puts the audience to think about and doubt any principle. ""The Man from Earth"" represents the most profound Q&A game by revisioning the history itself and humanity's passage. A film you can imagine a fervent Skeptic has composed it, only to counteract our genuine beliefs via science fiction scenarios. An echoing ""what if"" it continually emerges in the film as something like Rene Descartes' thought experiment with the evil demon. Jerome Bixby's idea, the film's writer, is not just different and pioneering, but also a revolutionary one. How many times have we involved ourselves in an endless debate about essential and existential matters? I dare to say several. By participating in such debates we discover and recreate our views, constantly moulding our personalities. And that is the biggest success of this extraordinary film. I expected nothing else from a movie shot in only one place, because, movies directed likewise becoming critically acclaimed. And that's the case with ""The Man from Earth"" and the director Richards Schenkman who stages a bunch of particularly representative characters sophisticated enough to sustain a relentless, thoughtful debate. Each one serves a domain, for example, biology, psychology and religion; but all of them are absorbed in a discussion that will make them reconsider their firmest beliefs. ""The Man from Earth"" creates a unique interaction which enforces the audience to experience every question and get even more surprised with the accompanied answer which renders it definitely interesting at first, and exceptional after watching it.",The Man from Earth

At best it held my attention until the end.It's very much average and mediocre - it will end up being the sort of thing people will reference in speculative conversations with their friends to help them feel smarter.

348,marjoriejackson1955,"poetic and intelligent, brilliant in its simplicity",10,28 December 2007,"Like all fans of classic science-fiction, I was familiar with Jerome Bixby's writing long before seeing this film. Like Asimov, Roddenberry, and Arthur C. Clarke, Mr. Bixby stands among the best of 20th century sci-fi visionaries. The Man From Earth, however, rises further perhaps than any science-fiction film has dared or even attempted since Clarke's 2001, challenging the viewer with an intellectual and historical road map of part-fact and part ""what if"", and accurately presenting much of what most people believe -- Christianity -- as hearsay and rumor and gossip, revised countless times by the churches who stand to profit from our very faith.I, for one, am a Christian. I believe in God and I believe in Jesus Christ. Having said that, I believe a good percentage of what I have been taught from childhood to be false. Not God's word, but rather man's attempt to express God's word, distorting it over and over again throughout the past few thousand years. As stated in this film; the history of Jesus Christ parallels the life of Hercules, from mythical Pagan folklore. The similarities to their two lives are remarkable, so much so that had Johnnie Cochran been alive and well and practicing law so many thousand years ago, whoever wrote the first tails of Hercules would have had a dead bang case of plagiarism against whoever published the first Bible, with regard to the life and times of Jesus Christ.But The Man From Earth is not about God-bashing, as some on this message board have claimed. It is about thinking, about ideas, about stretching not only the imagination, but looking beyond the furthest horizon and asking what if? Fundimentally, it's just a movie, intended to entertain us, the viewer. I personally doubt there are any 14,000 year old cavemen teaching History at Stanford. But unlike so many movies, The Man From Earth challenges the viewer to think. It has been nearly a month since my sister and I first watched it, and still we cannot stop debating and arguing. My husband has declared Friday to be Man From Earth Day, and the past two weeks we have had friends and family over for dinner and then we all watch the movie, and then we all talk about it, sometimes pretty loudly. Last Friday, we argued almost as much as the people in the movie, one couple didn't leave until two in the morning! Tonight my Father In-Law is coming over for dinner and a movie, and I am apprehensive to say the least, as he is a devout fundamentalist.My highest praise to Mr. Bixby, and to everyone else responsible for making this wonderful wonderful film. I cannot remember the last time I wished to have been in the shoes of a character, to participate in the story I was watching. The Man From Earth certainly is not for everyone, as there are no special effects, no car chases, no explosions, no nudity and no big name stars, and considering the mentality of religion, people across the globe still killing each other to this day in the name of their Gods, The Man From Earth is not for self-righteous intolerant individuals too trapped by their own self-importance to simply open their minds and ask a question or two. I still pray, I still believe. But not quite so blindly.",The Man from Earth
349,alexgmcm,I am honestly confused as to why this movie is so popular.,1,29 April 2010,"I really didn't like this movie. It is very poorly made which partly owes to its low budget but then Primer had a low budget and managed to seem much more professional than this.SPOILERS AHEAD!The scientific basis of the movie is inherently flawed as it says that his genes have happened to evolve such that they no longer have flaws when copying(mutations). But this is like saying that if you built a car perfectly you could reduce its chance of having an accident to zero when in fact the probability of the car having an accident is not a function solely of the car, it also depends upon the environment. In the same way, the chance of mutation is dependent upon the environment such as ionising radiation and mutagens and thus the mutations could not be entirely stopped by his genome.However, many sci-fi films have shaky scientific basis so we may excuse this. Then there is the fact that he doesn't scar, which would have to be unrelated to the previous genome modification but again we can excuse this as it isn't a major issue.The part that really irritated me was when it continued to peddle such misconceptions like that people still thought the Earth was flat at the time of Columbus even though that hadn't been a serious viewpoint since at least the days of Eratosthenes some one thousand years before. At one point he also attributes his fortuitous luck in not succumbing to disease to the idea that the 'Water and food were so much purer back then' (meaning neolithic times) when this is just patently false and plays to the prejudices of the New Age pseudo-intellectuals that seem to worship this film. We are much better off today in the age of quality control and water treatment than we were then even if there is the occasional gripe about HFCS or food intolerances.The final straw that proved just how crappy the film really is came when he reveals that he is in fact Jesus and spent time with the Buddha etc. by which point I was seriously wondering whether all the positive reviews of this movie were in fact the work of a Moriarty of trolls.In conclusion, the movie had some promise but was wrecked by poor acting and a host of basic scientific and historical mistakes. The movie seems to be popular only because it plays on New Age notions of the 'pure' neolithic times and the apparent simplicity of religion. If you want a good, cerebral experience then read a book, there must be dozens of sci-fi stories which explore similar themes but in greater depth and without the patronising attitude. Even some non-fiction works touch on similar themes, I would strongly recommend those by Carl Sagan for example.",The Man from Earth
350,feldmannu,This ain't Star Trek,10,18 January 2021,"Since I watched this film a couple of times I can say I love it.
It's not about the setting or the acting, which may be below average (despite David Lee Smith), but the story is one a kind. It always makes me think and it stays in my mind.

351,profligate,If Duncan McLeod were an academic...,3,9 February 2010,"I will temper the many rave reviews with another perspective so you can decide if you think this movie would be for you or not.The title is prefaced with Jerome Bixby's name. This explains the high rankings it gets: People who watch it already know and care who Jerome Bixby is and are most likely fans. Those who already know they don't like Jerome Bixby's work will give the movie a miss. I never heard of Bixby and I'm not a particular sci-fi fan although I'm not completely ignorant of it. Who will like this script: (1) People who think Star Trek is deep and profound. (2) People who think Bertrand Russell is a great thinker. If you are neither of those, my guess is you are likely to think this script is sophomoric and tedious.I read that Bixby wrote this on his death bed, his last work. Seems obvious he needed a vehicle to make clear his views on religion before he passed on. What disappointed me was that after a life time of creative work this script supposedly represents the greatest depths of his thinking. The whole time I watched this I was thinking, ""You're kidding. That's the best you can come up with?""It's nicely filmed and nicely acted. Good atmosphere. A couple of nice touches here and there. These are all due to the director and cinematographer. Sorry, but I just can't get passed the puerile philosophizing that supposedly represents the culmination of the writer's intellectual insight.",The Man from Earth

But this is the one film that compelled me to leave a statement here at IMDb.I have a habit of checking the IMDb rating before watching a movie. I would read a few summaries about the film before actually getting them, so I would know what to expect to say the least. But this movie just blew me off. I believe the high praises here are would still not do enough justice to such a superb movie. It is just too unique and extraordinary and even these words are mild to describe the movie.To me, this movie is the pinnacle of intellectual and thought provoking films. The setting of the film is very simple, everything just happens in a small living room. All the suspense and drama; the entire plot is made up of a few talking professors in that room. The entire cast was just so perfect that it kept me glued to screen the entire duration of the movie. The premise of the movie is about a professor who is actually an immortal who have roamed around Earth for 14 000 years. This movie delves into topic such as religion, human emotions, human behaviour, history and art. The ending of it also consist a rather welcomed twist that made the movie a whole great perfect package.I really didn't think it was possible to make such a superb movie, with just such a simple background. Yet, the depth offered by this movie is so great. I just can't think of any other more words to describe this masterpiece; it is definitely a must watch movie for this decade!

361,TheAtomicPunk,A great movie for open minded intellectuals,10,3 March 2008,"I'm sure most of the negative comments about this film break down into two groups: easily offended Christians and condescending science fiction fans. The first group is too close-minded to see that this movie wasn't an attack on anyone's values or customs, but rather a fantasy meant to explore the human condition. The second group takes so much pride in their superior knowledge that they're too arrogant too see that this movie wasn't really science fiction, it just uses a little sci-fi to suspend disbelief enough to explore an emotional topic.If you are a member of either of these two groups I wouldn't recommend watching this movie, I really don't think you'll get much from it. However if you have any curiosity in you about the origin of man and are open minded enough to explore some of the tougher questions, this movie might be interesting.There's really only one scifi plot element in the movie; the one that's mentioned in the tag line. It's the catalyst for so many great and puzzling questions. What if a man lived, not just through all of the history of civilization, but even through prehistory before the end of the last ice age? Archeologists and anthropologists agree that our species, in its current form, has existed for some 30 or 40 thousand years on this world, and in only the last quarter of that time have we lived in civilizations. What if someone could have lived through all the major phases of man's existence; through the exodus from the ice, through the establishment of the first cities, through all the known religions and customs? How would he survive? What would he remember? What would his life be like compared to one of ours? Would he have some great wisdom or superior knowledge of the world? Would he have had the chance to participate in any of our more notable historical events? How would people regard him if they knew his secret? In two hours this movie touches on a number of those questions, some which are obvious and others that are remarkably insightful. There are even a few surprises mixed in for good measure. It uses the characters to act out the various viewpoints and opinions we might have if we had to struggle to comprehend such an astonishing finding.By the end I was left with a good feeling because I felt as through its message was at my level emotionally. I even decided to go through the special features and commentary on the DVD and found Actor John Billingsley and Director Richard Schenkman's audio commentary hilarious.The participants in this film have a lot of ties with Star Trek, even though I really doubt that your average Star Trek fan would find it interesting. It was reportedly low budget but it's not noticeable. It's an intellectual film which can hold its own even with pure dialog. Some flashbacks to the life and times of the main character would have been amusing, but ultimately eye candy that would just accentuate the already pithy storyline.I give it a 10 out of 10.",The Man from Earth

368,banapaulo,Give this a read before watching...,7,23 June 2009,"I generally like to know as little as I can about a movie before watching it. I don't read blurbs or watch trailers. And so with this, The Man From Earth, I had only in my head ""Sci-Fi Drama, mostly dialogue, rated highly on IMDb"". However, having watched it I think there are a couple of things people should be wary of before watching so as to approach it at the right level.1. This looks and feels very much like an American TV-Movie. Now, my issue here is not budget or special effects - I knew it had none. But for other non-Americans like me you need to be aware that the format, direction, cinematography and especially acting is very much of that style. It's somewhat... stylised and cringe-worthy. It's just something you have to get accustomed to.2. If you're a sensitive Christian, be wary. The film doesn't particularly hide it's scepticism of the religion. It takes quite a long, hard pop at it. I'm not saying it's malicious, but it isn't subtle, and it dominates the second half of the movie.As for the film... I actively spend my spare time searching for thought-provoking science fiction movies. I like minimal effects and interesting ideas that make you go ""what if?"". And as such, I admire this film for trying to sweep you along on the strength of a fairly unique premise. It is an engrossing watch. However, this isn't exactly what one would call 'hard sci-fi'. It's ideas don't go a lot further than the premise, and ultimately they do reveal themselves to have a definite agenda, which is sad and probably the source of such a high IMDb rating.The more you think about it, the less daring and intelligent it seems, but I would cautiously recommend it for people looking for a film of ideas.",The Man from Earth

370,satishnaidu2000003,A film that reminds me of Stalker,10,3 December 2007,"In Tarkovsky's Stalker, the Room is a place where only the innermost wishes are fulfilled, wishes you might not even fully realize you had. The world that Tarkovsky portrays in that film is bleak and glum, but I believe that man, even in those grim circumstances, would wish for humanity's strongest desire, immortality. I have often wondered if the stalker is actually immortal, and if the Room is nothing but a scientific instrument to provide immortality, the stalker being an obvious product of that. John Oldman is a history professor, leaving his job and his friends of 10 years, to move over to a new place. It is a time for a final goodbye. As it turns out, its time for a shocking revelation  Oldman is a caveman who has survived the past 14,000 years. And as events follow, the scholars around him consisting of fellow academics who seem to have pretty much arrived at 'final conclusions' as far as their respective fields are concerned, have their thoughts truly provoked like never before. There's a clever observation the film makes early in the film. Dan, an archaeologist, asks John that the seemingly authentic burin in his home is one of those artifacts he has kept with and for himself as a well, memento. Dan replies that it is indeed from a thrift shop. Our primary instinct as audience is that he's obviously lying. Yet, seldom is it do we keep mementoes of our present. If we go back in time, we might treasure it then via mementoes and relics, for we're living in a time frame significantly different than us. But, if we're living in the present, all the time, it is a whole different ballgame. Put in front of an immortal, we would shoot questions that would primarily have to do with a lot of historical events. And, even for a man living in those times, he never would know everything about it. We seldom learn and know the present; most usually, and this is a solemn truth of humanity, we tend to learn about the present by realizing about it once it is past. Most often we experience that realization by means of books and art when the brilliant elite of humanity show us the way.It is this knack of consistently keeping us engaged in the discussion after having captured our imagination that makes TMFE as riveting a drama as it is a thriller. Often we find ourselves part of the discussion when one of the characters raises our questions, and often we revel in the journey the scholastic discussion is taking us through. Courtesy the script an equally adept direction and most importantly good performances, we know these characters, we realize their biases, we realize how their arguments are a result of their inner selves and the shock their intellect has received. Brilliantly blending conventional editing under a tent that is essentially an extended sequence, the film, in many ways, plays out like an extended sequence in an adapted for mainstream Tarkovsky film. I was reminded of the brilliant third act of Stalker, its ability to keep us intellectually alert without keeping the human aspects of it at an arm's length. As a minimalist science fiction it is gripping, but as an intellectual discussion it is that rare film that is stimulating. The color of the film is essentially brown, even the under-lit sequences having a brownish tinge to the proceedings. Amongst the woods, the film manages a nice little setting, enacting the kind of settings our protagonist usually likes. Or would like, since I guess brown is nature's most common color after green. The visual flair reminded me, yet again, of the serenity of Stalker. By means of close intense shots and its low-key lighting, the film grippingly creates a cozy environment of thought provoking discussion we feel home at. It reminded me of those nights in college, few friends wrapped under blankets, as we discussed the mysteries of life and world. There were a few arbitrary grainy shots, but I guess working on such a low budget is bound to have its effects. Or was it my copy? Part of the brilliance of the script, and it is one of the most stimulating of recent times, is its conviction in what it stands for. TMFE is essentially a film whose intellect thrives on issues of faith. To my great relief, this one believes in its stand, often taking strength from its protagonist's assured belief. It is a film that through a scenario of immortality, which we would like to exist, tries to disturb long-standing beliefs. It is never what the film believes that matters, it all boils down to how much of it we can believe and how much of it we can, well, consider as mere ""interesting discussion"". Why did John feel the need to reveal his secret? It is a question as puzzling. He claims a lot, some of it feels like the bragging part of a very true claim. He could be a man in the laboratory of time, a product of an aberration of time like the one suggested in Stephen Baxter's Time's Eye. Does his psychology work the same way as us? There're few films  Solaris, 2001, Stalker  that I felt should never end. This film made me feel that. That it has achieved it without a single special effect is all the more wondrous. It is very interesting for what could be a greater achievement for a film on immortality than making us want to run it forever, and ever. I wonder what made them name the film TMFE. I guess they see him as a prospect to explore outer space. Man from earth would be just about perfect for those species to address him. And if the species by an outside chance happen to know English, John Oldman wouldn't be bad either. Probably they'll appreciate the sense of humor.",The Man from Earth

The religious discussion was fascinating too - in that it brought out just a few of the things about ancient mythology, and how it relates to Biblical texts, that the vast majority of people are blissfully unaware of. As such, the movie can be a bit disturbing to any Christian fundamentalist, but then again, some ideologies need a little shaking up.I very much recommend this for anyone with a taste for philosophical speculation, or just plain old rich imagination in need of nourishment.",The Man from Earth

Like when I was a kid and I knew that He-Man really could run at near the speed of light because of all those muscles.We are hit like a Mack truck with the dumbest scene of the movie a mere three minutes in: we see him tossing a $10,000,000 Van Gogh into the back of his truck like it's a trash bag of clothes being donated to Goodwill. Logically, we'd assume that he ages normally, but at a very slow rate, so that 400 yrs to us would only be one yr to him. He'd be an infant for like 500 yrs. This isn't what happened, tho. We are told he ages normally to the age of 42 then, inexplicably, he just stops aging. Why? Because of the delicious water, nutritious food, and sweet mountain air. Ummm...I always thought that prehistoric man drank swamp water, scavenged for food, and burned everything in sight for warmth. Not exactly holistic living. Then, like the last car in a pile up, we discover that he is indeed still fertile after all these yrs and has produced a child, who just so happens to be in this very room. We are then treated to the corniest scene in cinematic history: upon learning that this man is his father he clutches at his chest and dies (because this is how heart attacks work, you die instantaneously). Why did he believe him so assuredly? Because like every TV show from my childhood, the simplest way to test somebody's authenticity is to query them on the name of your family dog.I actually thought the whole Jesus thing was an interesting concept, it was the reaction of the ppl around him that was stupid. If had just discovered I had been banging Cleopatra I wouldn't stop grinning for a week. His gf, tho? Apparently she has stage 10 autism because she has what amounts to a total non-reaction. The drama between them is that he has broken up with her. The movie closes with Oldman and his detached gf driving off into the darkness. Are these two love birds going to make it work? Or, is he just giving her a lift to the nearest bus stop?Thought provoking indeed.",The Man from Earth
374,dementedstud,a gripping movie experience,8,17 May 2008,"This was a short 80 minute film that couldn't have been done better than it is right now. Completely surviving on the story line, the movie was highly entertaining and quite thrilling during many moments. Though i found it hard to catch up with some of the history and geography of the subject in discussion, i was completely engrossed in the movie.The best part with ""man from earth"" is it transforms every viewer into one of the people in that room. With our own questions to ask and be startled by the answers, i found it quite fascinating. Gave it an 8 on 10 for its sheer strength in story and concept.The movie though had its weak points when the discussion went a little too far reaching the realms of film absurdity(though one would debate the whole movie as absurd). Discussion on Jesus and Buddha were a little annoying. The ending though was not too surprising but nonetheless the best that could have been done with the story.I watched it once and felt like i had noticed errors in the logic of the discussion but soon fumbled and lost them by the end of the movie. The director succeeds in keeping the viewer glued to the screen for the whole 80 minutes and in all, i feel its a very good movie with an amazing script.",The Man from Earth
375,jessicaadamsa,"Great Story, But Includes Subtle Bigotry",7,14 July 2021,"Its a great story, filled with wonder. But let's be honest. The movie embraces subtle bigotry towards Christians. Note that the Buddha is treated as real in the story, but Jesus is not. The teachings of Buddhism are never questioned... I greatly respect Buddhism, as I do Judaism and Christianity, but the belief in reincarnation is no less unscientific than the belief in Jesus being the son of God. Why is it that the movie criticizes Christian beliefs only?To an impartial observer, the movie is obviously used as a tool to discredit Christianity...to explain away all possibility that Jesus was real. The movie even goes out of the way to claim that all Christian beliefs and the bible itself are simply ideas stolen from other religions. This is not accurate. Its akin to saying the Mayan pyramids were ideas stolen from the Egyptians, when clearly the ideas were developed independently. Note that the story could have been made just as interesting by making John one of the apostles. Doing so would have avoided the ridiculous assertion that John the caveman somehow survived being crucified, played dead, and then emerged from the burial vault.Its also notable that the movie makers didn't have the courage to call into question that Islam is not real as well. Was that out of fear of violence? It would have easily been incorporated...",The Man from Earth

The idea, the treatment and presentation are so different from conventional commercial cinema that its amazing and unbelievable that something can be put up so simply and still be so thrilling. The movie is not sensationalised like Da-Vinci Code or even promoted like it and thats a pity as avid movie goers would find it more than entertaining, may be even food for thought. It must be one of the best sci-fi's (if u consider it that) and the makers have proved that no CGI or elaborate settings can ever take place of a great idea.

379,brislev,Seemingly low budget surprise,8,22 December 2007,"At first glance, I was thinking Foxtel(Australia) Friday night midnight porn production!! But how wrong was I? This movie really made me think. It was confronting, profound and more. I admit, the ending didn't satisfy, which I thought about a fair bit throughout(How it would end that is), but what an original, refreshing piece of work. The acting was pretty good(Especially 'Candy Man'), and the main character was most convincing. For a low budget movie that I had heard of from word of mouth, I was highly impressed, not my usual cup of tea. I would say, give it a go, to anyone with an open mind. You will not be disappointed with this quirky challenging production",The Man from Earth
380,ferahl,Disappointed,1,23 April 2008,"I'm disappointed with the film, do ""intellectuals"" feel they need to rate this title well because it supposedly addresses them? It reminds me of some contemporary art..The acting is wooden from most of the cast, but I don't really blame them because the dialogue is unnatural and lacking in fluidity.There was no meaningful insight into humanity or our history from the 14,000 year old man without any charisma. The history lesson was basic and boring, and nothing that we didn't already know, which leads me nicely on to the point of the film.A film is supposed to inform, inspire emotion, or entertain in my opinion - unfortunately this film just doesn't do it.But nice try, I like the premise.",The Man from Earth
381,jeven,Not all atheists are bad people,10,24 January 2012,"Although I hate the word ""athiest"" because of it's erroneous negative connotations, I must admit that I do NOT believe in God. I do however consider myself to be a good person, husband of 40 years (to the same wonderful woman), good father, etc. I think this film presents religion for what it really is... the continuation of ancient myths and stories handed down from time immemorial. As we are taught as children to believe in, as George Carlin said, ""an invisible man who lives in the sky"" it becomes so deeply embedded in our psyche that we cannot shake the belief. Even now, in my 60's, I get that little ""twinge"" when I say I don't believe in God. This film presents religion and history in a rational alternative to what we have all been taught. Why can't IT be true and the ""truth"" be wrong?",The Man from Earth
382,the_rb-1,Meh,3,22 June 2009,"The reason I watched this movie was because I was a huge fan of the Highlander series on TV as a kid, and I've always thought that the series was great at utilizing flashbacks to show how certain events and experiences can shape a person's life. So when I saw that 'The Man From Earth' was about a 14,000 year old immortal, I was interested to see if Bixby would do something similar.The movie went in another direction however, and focused not so much on individual growth but the growth of societies and their views on history, religion, etc. This is done without much visual aid: the entire movie is a long, poorly written discussion.I like to think of this movie as sort of a preamble to an introduction to an intellectual movie. Any views this movie challenges happen on a very low level. These include: ""Some religions may be wrong"", and ""Man's view of history often gets skewed over a period of time."" And I'd like to make sure you all know that it's not because the movie was just a discussion that it failed. Stalker, by Tarkovsky, is a film which is 90% discussion. THAT is an intellectual film, which challenges views on many different levels. The Man From Earth is a movie that is only slightly interesting but pretends to be much more.If you want a good story about an 'immortal', go watch Highlander. If you want an intellectual movie, watch a Tarkovsky film. Don't waste your time with this movie!",The Man from Earth

This movie takes place for near enough its entirety in one room.. its not so much a movie as more a discussion between intellectuals. I'll assume everyone knows the basic premise of the film so I wont go into the plot.I really enjoyed this, i think its one of those things you watch and may discard, however over the course of time you might look back at it and think that was unique and different and you may appreciate it more than when you immediately viewed it.When i sat down to watch it i thought this would be the most boring 90 minutes or so of my life however, i think it was a well written script with believable characters, and a man telling a story that you really want to hear!",The Man from Earth

With no special effects, or any action scenes at all. However it does contain excellent dialogue, acting, and emotion and thought provoking scenes.It is in my opinion, the one film you must simply watch, It is a privilege to sit back back and let the story, and characters massage your soul.There is a TV series of a similar nature as this film, called New Amsterdam, if you're wanting more after seeing this. It doesn't star the same characters, nor have the exact same plot, and focuses a lot on finding true love, rather than the (long) life story this film focuses on.

Not a lot to show or had any actions in it but it was the film for me. I like these kind of movies with conversations and dialogues that has a different point of view than i do. This movie is basically for the open minded people that will hear the opinions of others, because it will definitely change the way you think. I advice this movie for everyone to watch.

387,rasto_novak,One of best low-budget movies I've ever encountered,10,6 December 2012,"I didn't know what to expect when I ran this flick. Nevertheless, when the discussion started with their topic I was entirely dragged into it. I did not mind at all the missing special effects to underline the points or facts that they were talking about, even if it is a sci-fi movie. The arguments were so strong that I didn't want to reach the end of the movie. It was so good to listen and to think about the facts they said, that I had to watch it twice more and still finding new interesting details. The scene with Jesus coming into the subject of questions is brilliant, same applies for the last scene. Low-budget, only a few actors, ingenious screenplay, and absolutely mind-blowing result ....I just love when a movie lets me think about it for several days.",The Man from Earth

The actors didn't know if they were acting in a play or in a film.The story takes place in one house and this guy tries to convince his colleagues that he's been a live since the dawn of man, he doesn't age. He's moving to another city since he's afraid people may notice he's not aging. They are all college professors and they are listening to him trying to be open minded but the stuff that's coming out his mouth is just ridiculous and it only gets worse.I love bad movies sometimes but it has to be enjoyable.

I think that explains the large split in ratings. It is a 5-6 for the most part with brief spikes to 8-9, but it is never really a 7. So if you can tolerate the B movie looks and the roller coaster quality it is quite enjoyable, maybe even charming. Also: Be ready for a drama, not an action film.",The Man from Earth

During the Movie you get the feeling of actually being there and experience a sort of sensation of -is this real or is this a lie?. You enter a stage where you almost would like to ask the main character things you would want to know.The location is warming and relaxed but gets its climaxes from now and then.The movie resolves into an ending you spend your 90 minutes waiting for.With a good twist. i recommend this movie highly to audiences who like to think about the movie even days after watching.Its very entertaining and well shot too.So don't miss this one its a pleasure to watch.",The Man from Earth

Despite zero action and it being set in only one location, this movie delivers better than most science fiction movies. The script/dialogue of the main character takes you through the life of a man who by a fluke of genetics, hasn't aged past 30. The main character tells the story of his personal perspective of history; his personal experiences, relationships, philosophical insight and even his important significance as a historical figure. All in all, a really good movie, filmed on a low budget, written by a science fiction guru, that should be on every sci-fi lovers watch list.",The Man from Earth
393,jd1338,Average at best and not nearly as philosophical and intelligent as most people claim,4,2 April 2020,"I don't get it. Why are so many people loving this movie so much? It's predictable, overacted and the character development is implausible. I felt like I watched a strange mix of the X-Files and CSI Miami.The idea is good. But it's not THAT innovative. Problem is that the execution is just bad. And I'm not talking about the low-bugdet feeling of the movie. It's just pseudo-intellectual.I mean, why is the archeologist so personally offended at first and changes his mind in like 10 minutes. Why doesn't the religious woman don't believe him at all but is crying when he tells that he was Jesus. Oh my god, is she in doubt? So philosophical! And why is the psychiatrist so interested at first and then points a gun on the caveman guy. Yeah, because his wife died yesterday, right. Then he drives around for an hour and comes back. Who wouldn't? Oh, and he is caveman's son. What the heck?And the music... Oh my gosh. ""Let's use this cheap sample to let everyone know that something strange is happening. Also, there will be a punch-line in 10 seconds!""Everything about this movie is 90s while it was shot in 2007. That is not bad per se.

Well, 13.7 to be precise. The point is, the idea that a human might live for fourteen thousand years should provoke awe inspiring questions, and instead we get a film which ignores them in favor of a focus on religion, and not a very interesting focus either. The script is condescending, and none of the actors are believable as professors in their respective fields. The contrivance of the script is transparent, but that's to be expected- after all who wants to do much homework for a movie script? How is it that a man lives through 140 centuries and only knows English? He is a male of prime fighting age, but he was never pressed into military service? Ever? He was never shot at or stabbed? We are to believe that his special survival abilities extend solely to cancer and infectious diseases, but not trauma?

395,Furious_is,DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE!,3,13 February 2018,"Maybe that statement is a little facetious, but I feel it is true. I read AMAZING reviews for this film. I went in with high hopes, expecting a well acted, thoughtful, existential and quiet science fiction film. Instead I saw a film so poor I wondered what's the scam here? How could this film possibly have a score in the high 7s.The premise is solid at first glance, but as the film moves along it delves deeper and deeper in to melodrama, and then eventually patronising and insulting trash. I am agnostic, but I found the religion bashing heavy handed and unnecessary. Most of the actors were doing the best they could with the script, but everything comes across flat and lifeless. None of the characters rang true. None of the dialogue sounded like how real people actually talk. If you want to make a science fiction film that shies away from special effects, and instead relies on realism and storytelling, you had better make the dialogue realistic, and the storytelling compelling. Sadly neither are found here.The look of the film, I get that it is a low budget film made on a single location, but the quality of the film stock! It may seem petty, but I could not get over the thought that I have seen better looking lifetime films. Honestly I have seen better looking daytime soaps from the 80s.Basically I don't get why anyone would call this film good, let alone a masterpiece. I have read rave reviews, 10/10 reviews, gushing about how thought provoking and challenging this film was. My thoughts were ones of disdain. My challenge was to finish this abysmal film. Many of the reviews seem to fixate on the fact that the writer of this wrote for the original Star Trek series. That to me is not a good enough reason to rate this film highly. I honestly felt ripped off by this film. I've been told I didn't get it, but sadly I did. I understood every scene, I understood the implications, I understood the moral dilemmas and deeper meaning of what was being said. It's just that the deeper meaning was shallow and unconvincing. I've been told maybe I should have watched Transformers instead. Just for the record, I was looking forward to a slow, intelligent film minus explosions. Instead I got, this.3/10, avoid unless you have already drunk the kool-aid and are pre-conditioned to love the film because the writer worked on Star Trek.",The Man from Earth

The narrative flows forth very subtly and gradually, which goes well with the unreal story and the ethereal soundtrack.That being said, the story is the only thing that this movie has got going for itself. The picture quality is horrid, with severe grain, color inconsistency and poor light. Aesthetically, the scenes are bland and the camera work is dull, even boring. The movie takes place pretty much on a single location, which is admirable in a sense, but also fairly dull. Most notably, the acting is somewhere between average and terrible, and although the characters are cast fairly well, the lines are delivered unenthusiastically and monotonously. A serious problem for a movie which is driven entirely by dialogue!By all the rules, this movie should be a disaster. And yet it isn't. It's fascinating and seductive in it's simple premise.

It's rare that you can stumble upon a thinking person's movie nowadays.What if you are as old as humanity itself, what if you have stood witness the evolution of mankind from its birth to the present day, what would you have done, which chapters in mankind's history would you have written.The concept of immortality is as old as mankind itself, but never before have I seen this concept explored with such, thoughtfulness and philosophy.One minor thing I did not like about the movie is the prolonged overly dramatic outright hostility towards John's confession.

The acting was a little wooden but the story-line was fast enough (after a slightly slow start) to save dwelling on this. A sci-fi film with absolutely no special effects, relying solely on the story and a room-full of actors.A highly recommended film that needs some concentration and thought to fully appreciate, and that might even cause a tear if you become fully immersed.

I saw this movie back in 2007 and it still stays with me and is a constant reminder that wonderful cinema will always be more than CGI.I came here to finally leave a review on this movie after leaving my frustrated negative review on another movie.

So I rated it as a film for a mature audience.Personally though, I absolutely feel that children would be the best audience for this film. I can imagine that it might be quite thought-provoking to a child. I would, though, have thought that most adults would find the whole thing too flat and simple to really captivate. The characters often act and react in contrived and incoherent ways, taking away from the credibility of the story and the immersion of the viewer.For those who remember the ""The Twilight Zone"", to me this movie felt a bit like an episode of that (if better and a bit more intelligent) - exciting for children, but not very captivating for mature viewers.

I do not have a problem with atheists, but make an effort to understand what you are saying (theologically and historically) about what you perceive as your enemy. This movie had potential, but they failed miserably. However, I am sure they succeeded at converting some of the general masses to atheism - purely through rhetoric and false intellectualism, but void of substance.Do not get me wrong, I love this genre of movies and science fiction in general, but without any action or good acting the movie was relying 100% on the plot and writing, which turned into historical and theological comedy.",The Man from Earth
410,StarTrekLIVES,Wow!,10,19 November 2007,"Leave it to a Star Trek writer to make the best sci-fi movie in years. A retiring history professor reveals his true identity to his close friends; that he was born a caveman 14,000 years ago, and never died. At first they think he's joking or maybe crazy, then they begin to wonder if it might really be true.Man from Earth was written by Jerome Bixby, and is similar to his TOS episode Requiem for Methuselah, (an immortal who has ""been"" people from Earth history, including several historical figures) and it works on many levels; philosophical, emotional, dramatic, even moral. Is it right to live forever, watching helplessly while everyone you know dies? If you're immortal, is it your responsibility to make the world a better place? I never heard of this movie until a few days ago, and now it's all my friends and I can talk about. I love most sci-fi movies, but how many really make you think? I personally didn't walk out of E.T. thinking about morality or human history. This movie makes you think, it wakes you up to new ideas. It's like a non-boring history lesson on things you never knew, or even imagined.Some people won't like Man from Earth because it challenges their beliefs,their very faith. Hopefully they'll walk away better people. If not reconsidering their faith, at least looking at it from a more logical point of view.

No fancy effects, no false heroism, no huge explosions, just mesmerizing story. I specially liked disappearing of furniture in background, which reduced set to actors, fireplace and cosy couch only.

You have to make your audience like the players enough to listen to them yap for an hour and a half. And it helps to have philosophy a tad deeper than a comic book.

413,franjo_frlic,8.1 ?!! Have you people seen the same movie as I?,3,16 July 2009,"Lets start with ridiculous casting, horrible acting, poor editing and non existing scenography. It is much easier to list what this movie has that is done good (but i cant think of anything right now) then all the things this ""film"" is lacking. It is worst then many TV movies so that is enough said about that. The premise of the movie is very good band will keep you watching just to see what will the protagonist say next. The producer of this movie must have seen ""The Da Vinci code"", and said to him self ""Ill make a film with a religiously insulting theme, maybe ill make me some money"". He made the same thing Dan Brown & company did; played with few facts unknown to the person of average education and combined them in a nice low budget movie story. There is a few things that easily dismiss this movies premise as comical; firstly being a biology teacher i am quite convinced that no self respecting biologist would take seriously that a man can live 14000 years like that poorly portrayed biologist in the film, let alone try to explain it with cellular regeneration. Secondly we should have in mind that science does not know almost anything about prehistoric man that is not on a theoretical level. It is very strange that John recalls almost everything just in the manner that modern science explains it. For example some scientist question the very existence of an ice age. Thirdly the ""Jesus years"". A white guy cruising around Asia hanging out with Buddha?? Then he comes to his former home that is Rome as an ex Etruscan to find it corrupt and so on..Just a few things, Etruscans and Romans did not liked each other much, Romes true history started when they got rid of Etruscan kings, so why would an Etruscan call Rome home? If John was so disappointed and wanted to make Rome better why did he stay in afar away province of Judea and preached there? A white guy looking like a Roman cruising around Judea preaching to the Jews??? All John had to do to stop Christianity was to talk to Saint Paul without who's efforts Christianity would probably disappear and Saint Peter would not go to Rome to ""teach fishing"" and found the Church who's ceremonies are not just a series of weird rituals so much as a sign of remembrance and respect for the Man who brought us the Light, and it wasn't a 14000 years old Cro-Magnon named John.",The Man from Earth

Because it is an intelligent made movie and it forces you to use your own brain - qualities only a few movies have. The discussion (here at IMDb) goes about the criticism of Christianity. I think this is not the point of the movie. This movie is only criticising people who literally believe in the words of the fairy tales written in the Bible. Not the idea behind. People who _behave_ like Christians, not just go to church on Sunday, can enjoy the movie because it doesn't change a thing to them. They will still care about social coexistence, still be nice to others and still always try to do the right thing. I suggest to take some time, turn on your brain, and watch this movie with friends or family. Maybe you can get a new point of view, a new perspective.

416,emily_contact,Interesting concept-gone totally awry.,1,23 February 2015,"I watched this movie as I saw it on a list of great movies to watch which no one has ever heard of. Reading the summary I was pretty excited as it sounded like a creative concept. But then the moment the movie started, the editing, directing, acting, cinematography...everything was really low quality and poorly done. I honestly could not believe this was released in 2007! I'll be blunt-the movie starts out pretty bad, then gets interesting (but it feels more like a documentary with several scholars discussing an idea like from the discovery channel of 'how it might be possible'), but then it got weird.There were many historical inaccuracies of his accounts of things which anyone who's studied those topics knows weren't the way things happened, but perhaps a filmmaker doesn't realize it. Overall, his stories were quite unrealistic. And yes, I do realize the whole premise is unrealistic, but at least they should have been a little more creative than having the protagonist meet every single famous person from history (including him turning out to be Jesus). Then the movie gets weirder. The one thing I will give the movie though is it shows how easily humans are skeptical, and equally, how suggestible we are once we have decided to believe in something (as depicted when he pretends at the end that the whole story is false, and everyone is more upset at him than in the beginning as they had started to finally believe him). I really wish that the previous people hadn't given this movie an 8 star rating, as it was so poorly executed, and overall just incredibly underdeveloped in terms of script, plot and characters.

419,jeremy-915-532321,"Good, but doesn't live up to the hype",5,19 August 2011,"Firstly, let me say that I really wanted to enjoy this film. It sounded right up my street after all the glowing reviews. However, I have come away disappointed, and must admit I am a bit bemused by the raving about it.This film has a ""made for TV"" air about it. Whether it is the dodgy acting in places, or the slightly forced script I'm not sure, but it feels amateurish, especially at the start where I was cringing at points. However I stuck with it and the last 30 mins were a lot more watchable. The whole air made me think of the 12 Angry Men remake, although I enjoyed that a lot more.I don't think I'm giving anything away by saying that the protagonist claims to be 14,000 years old to a group of intellectual friends. The entire film is a conversation in his lounge that results from this revelation.The film is played ""straight"". There are no magic effects or weird powers. Just a normal guy who says he has lived for a long time. Whilst this sounds like a fascinating premise I found it very flat in practice. The film turns into a potted rapid fire history lesson which doesn't suddenly become interesting just because a guy says ""I was there"". As the characters constantly point out, this is stuff you can read in any history text book. The point of the film seems to be to put history into reality by the context of one man experiencing it, but this is nothing revolutionary. If you can imagine yourself living from the stone age you've pretty much got the film right there. The script keeps correcting the erroneous assumptions of the friends, and by extension the watcher, but to me these corrections were self evident and in no way clever.Later the film leans toward religious history and debate, but while superficially interesting, again it's nothing any watcher of reasonable intellect will have not known. In these days of constant religious debate / argument on the Net, everything has been covered in far greater depth.I came within a hair's breadth of giving up on the film half way through, but stuck with it just to see the outcome. As I said, I found the latter end of the film more interesting for some reason. The acting didn't seem so wooden, and people got personal rather than reciting history. The ending was reasonable.I suspect a lot of the high marks given to this film are purely because it's refreshing to have a film that is actually intelligent and thoughtful rather than dumbed down action. I agree that such films are rare and should be lauded, but much as I want to I cannot give this film the accolades that everyone else seems to.Anyone who wants dumb action is going to hate this film without a doubt.

The dialogue is also a little forced, but this may have something to do with the editing. I had the feeling that if the actors would have worked for a percentage of the profits, I probably could have shot this movie myself using an old home video camera in 2 days, for about 10 dollars.If however I was to rate this movie on the concept I would have to give it an 8 (or 9) out of 10.

Although the movie isn't action paced like most of sci-fis, this one is masterfully crafted when it comes to characters dialogues. I caught myself wondering and questioning my very beliefs while being amazed by the movie's excellent plot.

A group of his colleagues drop by unexpectedly to say goodbye, and John regales them with a story that he allegedly has never shared in his long, most peculiar life. I would normally find this kind of single-scene movie quite laborious, I found myself quite engaged in the story and the characters. At the end, I felt a little let down because I wanted to know more about John, I wanted the story-telling to go on. It felt almost like a prologue to a much larger and more epic story.

This movie stands out of a big crowd today's big budget Hollywood blockbusters by being a piece of art and philosophy. It has no special effects, no beautiful scenery, just a few aging scholars debating in one room for 90 minutes about a man who is possibly 14 thousand years old. What I liked the most about it is that it is aimed at proving complete nonsense statement as truth. In this way it is similar to another very well accomplished movie, sci-fi documentary ""Dragons: A Fantasy Made Real"". It is a philosophical discussion about perception and believes which shape up our biased truth even today. Movie has very low pace requiring a lot of patience from viewer but it prepares and rewards you with some great discoveries and emotional moments. However, movie has a few strong flaws. Argumentation is often naive and flat which does not evoke discussion of educated men. Movie lacks details. Also, camera work seems to be week, sometimes annoying.",The Man from Earth

This is the forward and bold thinking we need if we really want to evolve - technological progress is not enough. The concept of an argument-supported discussion among intelligent and educated people gives it proper credibility. It is a great approach to shed new light on already accepted (but likely invented and imagined) stories imposed by years of religious dogma. It was also greatly paced with a final snap, saying it was all a story, allowing only the most persistent to find out the truth. Nevertheless, I was disappointed in the acting. I am aware that no celebrity would accept such a bold role, especially now when most of us are still not ready or not willing to peek beyond. Hopefully, in a few years of so, it will be properly remade with A-list casting (not mainstream) to have a greater impact. 10 for the idea and boldness, but only 5 for the acting.

It is a film that has forced me to ask myself this question ------ why aren't more such movies made? It is a great example of how great scriptwriting and great performances alone can make a fascinating movie. Jerome Bixby, the brain behind great television shows like Star Trek and Twilight Zone wrote the script for this movie on his death bed in the April of 1998, making it his last project.It is astounding to know that director Richard Schenkman roamed around for eight years with Bixby's script, looking for a producer. Finally, he decided to produce the movie himself and made it at a very modest budget of $200,000 US.

The acting is more or less solid, but all very television-y. Indeed, as the screenplay was written by someone best known for his scripts for Twilight Zone and Outer Limits, this probably would work better as a television movie, a trifle that HBO, Showtime or Lifetime would offer to fill out the programming day.

434,machined,I can't believe this poor excuse for a film has such a high rating,1,3 September 2013,"I am amazed at the rating this movie gets on here, and the number of people who give it positive reviews who I assume are avid film lovers. This is simply not a good movie, and you should all be ashamed of yourselves for confusing it with one.First, let's talk a little about what a film should have in order to be considered watchable. WritingThis is not a well written movie. Yes, there are lines of dialog, and yes those are written in a grammatically correct fashion, and yes we understand why people are saying what they're saying, but that doesn't make it well written. None of the dialog serves any purpose other than to allow our main character to spin his tale, and the reactions they have to it are hardly realistic and only there to serve the furthering of this story. Not the story in the film, because the film has no story, but the story that the main character is telling about himself. That's essentially all there is, which might be fine in a lecture hall, but that alone does not a film make.CharactersThese characters are what I think most people would consider ""paper thin"". In a normal movie, you get some basic understanding of who people are beyond their job description and how they're dressed. Not here though, as there's very little to go upon besides some vague caricatures of ""professors"" who we're supposed to believe are working professionals with degrees and such (except for one caricature of a student) but we're not given any evidence that they actually have anything more than a cursory knowledge of any subject they talk about. Instead we have a couple half-assed attempts at giving them personality traits that don't lend anything to the movie and no real reason to care about any of the characters or why they're there. That goes for the main character too. We don't care about him except for knowing the fundamental premise of the movie, which is supposed to make his character interesting, but really doesn't. His character only exists to spit out this story, which save for a few interactions with the other people in the room all of which fail to convince me that he's actually known these people for 10 years, is exactly what he does. ActingMaybe it's the fault of the writing, but the acting didn't even come off as all that good. I know you can't do much when you'e given stereotypical characters delivering ham-handed dialog, but I didn't see anything noteworthy from any of the actors or actresses involved. It actually reminded me at times of a group of real professors with no acting experience trying to act, although no academic would ever be caught dead reading this stuff out loud, and I doubt the actual actors were trying to act like they weren't acting.DirectionThe direction is basically nonexistent. It's not because it all takes place in one room. It's not because there's a lot of talking. It's because there was seemingly no interest in doing anything interesting with the camera. That's okay because there's nothing interesting done with the music, or with the cinematography, or anything production wise really, so at least it's consistent. ConceptHere we get down to brass tacks, because everyone who loves this movie presumably does so because of the fairly original concept of one man living through all the ages of human civilizations. On the surface I have no problem with this idea as I've never seen it played out before, but as this movie progressed it became clear how very self serving this concept is. My wife calls this an ""ultimate white male fantasy"" second only to the ""one of the last men on earth and needing to rebuild civilization"" trope of dystopian fiction. In this case, not only do you get to be a part of every major era in human history, and in one case being THE most important figure in history (taught by another very important figure in history), but you get to stay 35 forever, be more knowledgeable than your peers, and then you get to EXPLAIN IT ALL to them, even thought they don't end up believing you but that's okay because you know the truth and they don't (exasperated sigh). Don't even get me started on the ""twist ending"" as it wasn't really unexpected or mind blowing, and didn't even seem to be all that important to the main characters as the movie comes to a close, which if I actually cared for the movie would have infuriated me. I am giving this film 1 star, not because I disliked the movie, but because it fails on all levels as a movie. Film is supposed to be an art form. Art is not simply telling your audience to think about something and expecting them to think about it. Instead it's supposed to use every creative tool it can to get people to respond to it and think about it the way you want them to. Was this movie supposed to be only shown in first year History of World Cultures classes and used for discussion purposes?

If you just sit and watch the film, don't expect fabulous sets or glamorous costumes, big action scenes or shakespearian dialogue, I'm pretty sure you will enjoy it
It makes you think a little, question some things (as do some of the characters in the km) but mostly it's just a simple film to watch but brilliantly written
The sequel..... Well..... Watchable but not really needed
This is a great film which is very individual in its style and content
Masterpiece? Maybe not.......
A waste of time? Personally I think its great and am looking forward to watching it again.....
It's in your hands",The Man from Earth
436,sammehta,A creative triumph and a must watch for sci-fi buffs!,9,18 February 2020,"After the approximate hour and a half of the film's runtime, I sat still in my bedroom, wondering ""Wow! That was indeed one hell of a movie"".Very rarely do Hollywood, or for that matter any ""'wood"" comes up with a movie based on just dialogues, and makes your brain question and work out the plot! The Man from Earth is not just a movie which you watch with your eyes and ears. It is a movie which forces you to run your brains, to derive conclusions based on the dialogues. And biggest of all- whether you believe it is real or just a tell-tale!I am sure if a hundred movie-goers watch the movie, atleast half of them would bash the movie for being unrealistic and hurting religious sentiments blah blah! But these are the people who have never used, and thus sadly don't know how to use their brain for inference and debate.A story of a Cro-Magnon, living until the present time is not something you'd ) come across even once in a decade or two! As one of Professor Dan's (Tony Todd) dialogues in the film, ""How often do we get to meet someone who says he is a Stone Age man?"" All the arguments and rebuttals in this sci-fi flick are accurately based and make complete sense if given a proper thinking to! The only character I hated and wished she weren't in the movie was Edith (Ellen Crawford). Edith is just a blind follower of Christianity who although accepts that Bible(or for that matter any so called ""holy book"") has undergone a lot of changes, yet she has this unshakable belief in God. Good for her! But she has absolutely zero logic to her arguments and she is more often than not, irritating and a liability in the living room.The end of the movie, I won't spoil it for those reading this review, is really satisfying to the whole story.Go ahead and surely watch this movie. This isn't a kind of movie which you can binge watch on a night after a tiring day or just to take your mind off things. You actually need to think throughout the movie and make sense of everything being said! But be rest assured, it is completely sensible and logical.",The Man from Earth

We have to give it some credit for that in a time when our screens are polluted with plot less stories like ""The day the earth stood still"" or ""I am legend"".I was a bit annoyed by the fact that the story is somewhat offensive to Christianity. Don't take me as a fanatic, I'm not like the blond woman in the movie. I did find the comparison of the teachings of Buddha and Jesus interesting and worth a debate. But I do wonder why is it that all movies tend to take it to Christianity. It is very rare to find a movie that is offensive to Judaism (I can only recall The Passion), Islam, Buddhism, or any other religion. But you do see movies offensive to Christianity all over the place. They could have said the guy was one of the apostles and tell more or less the same story about Jesus and it would have been more tasteful and would have added more subtleties. You can say it wouldn't make such a strong impact in the viewers, buy hey! this movie is intended to be subtle, if you want to see a movie that readily makes an impact on the viewer you can watch any blockbuster sci-fi.I think the movie fell short on the whole bunch of stuff he could have said.

It seemed stilted and unnatural (not that I could do better!). Unlike other reviewers I don't think that it improved as the movie progressed - you just get used to it.The movie has an interesting premise which it explores in detail off and on for about two thirds of its length - if you encountered a man who claimed to have lived for 14k years, what could he tell you to prove it? The other third is typical Hollywood Christian bashing. It follows the usual template. First you introduce characters purported to be highly intelligent professors and scientists. This gives their sophomoric pontifications credibility with the audience. Then you throw in a hysterical ""Christian literalist"" to show what anti-intellectual idiots Christians really are. Sci-Fi books often follow the same tedious template. If they wanted to do something original they should have tried bashing a different religion for a change, like Islam. That would have been bold!

Also, I thought the ending was very satisfying. The story just got better and better as it moved along. It even had a couple of big surprises. I have rarely seen a movie of this type that was so fascinating and deeply satisfying. Unfortunately, people with strong religious beliefs might find this story offensive because it makes strong statements about the accuracy of the bible. I have read some reviews that believe the whole purpose of the story was to attack the bible. The part about the bible is a small part of the whole story and fits in perfectly with the story's premise.

The only proof offered is him explaining what he saw in those 14 thousand years and everyone deep thinking his comments and actually saying ""well that would make sense"". What actually would happen is that those professors would have said ""well it's been quite a night I really must be going now"". I would much rather see a movie like K-Pak where he illustrates to disbelieving scientist's where his planet resides in the cosmos and actually draws a diagram that proves out and even explains a missing piece that the same scientists need to complete a theory they had.

449,Mush_Man29,The Best Movie I Have Ever Seen,10,1 January 2008,"I heard about this movie after reading an article about the director Robert Schenkman thanking internet video pirates for sharing this film over the internet.Thank John Oldman that they did.This film is without a doubt, the most riveting, most intense film I have ever seen. All without a single shot being fired, no multi-million dollar explosions and not a shred of cheesy lines. Actually, it's 1:27 hours of 6 or so people sitting around a fire.The Man From Earth was indeed, an intellectual film, with the greatest of insight. There was a scene which stuck in my mind about the discussion of Christianity and its links to Buddhism: I've spoken to a Buddhist monk AND a Christian priest prior to watching this film, and both believe that what is mentioned in the film may very well have been a staunch reality.This film doesn't throw anything down your throat. The Da Vinci Code, for example, gave you a story to follow - The Man From Earth gives you a person. There are experiences which he won't remember, experiences that are a bit hazy - far from a blockbuster script where the ""hero"" will remember every detail and glorify himself.The acting is first class, the director makes you feel as though you're part of the discussion. The first 8 minutes, for me, felt like a wait. From the 9th minute onwards, I had closed the door to my room, turned the volume up and sat hanging off every word.THIS, is what science fiction is all about. Not futuristic spacecraft, but of something which may very well be a reality, something which you can actually believe is real. The suspense the viewer is left in, right up until the final moments, is simply fantastic.I feel compelled to thank both the Director, Richard Schenkman, and the Writer, Jerome Brixby for what really deserves to belong very highly in IMDb.com's Top 250.For someone who is only 18 years old, I truly believe that I won't ever see another film as fantastic as this in my life time. It simply cannot be described, I only hope that you manage to find a copy, even if it be on the internet, and watch this film.I, for one, will be ordering the DVD next week.",The Man from Earth

Sure, there has been a few movies in between that had a similar scenario, but somehow, they always end up compromising themselves in the end - adding some twist or ""shock"" value to reward the audience's patience; to give them a closure. But in both MDWA and TMFE, the premises were laid out in the beginning to suggest that there's no hidden surprises, and it gives you a choice to leave or stay for what comes ahead. Any emotions provoked come from the words of the protagonist, no embellishments whatsoever.

Not with spaceships and effects, but with intelligent characters and exceptional dialogue, and that it left me with a sense of true wonder and joy, long after the credits ended. If the movie had been two hours longer I still would not have been bored, even though most of the film takes place in one small room. It's like watching a ninety minute Twilight Zone, with a perfect surprise ending. John Billingsly stands out, as does David Lee Smith, who may or may not be a caveman. The rest of the cast is good, but the script is the true star. And to anyone claiming this film is boring because we never leave the one room; Some of the very best Twilight Zones were just that. Good actors, good scripts, one or two locations.

It's entertaining, slightly thought-inducing when it takes on a few deep topics, in particular relating to religion.The acting is average, the storyline below average and the production value way below average. But because it takes on religion, it so far received incredible ratings (higher than most iconic scifi flicks in fact) from a specific group of American viewers who perhaps feel oppressed by the lack of separation between church and states in their own country.For people outside this demographic, this movie comes across as very bland and unimaginative. Even the so called 'groundbreaking' ideas it touches have been re-hashed over and over again, no only in theological cycles but also on the Internet and in other movies.The only shocking discovery this movie brought me is how small minded and angry some reviewers are on this site. 10/10 just because the movie's main character poo-pooed the religious dogma you hated so much as a child?

The truth, when you come up with a good idea, get someone to write a script the will do justice to it, bring it to life and entertain, mystify.

I found the background score of this movie very haunting and appropriate for association with the ambiance required for the movie.The movie is a complete entertainer, there is thrill and suspense, in the movie, the sort that I have not experienced in years in any movie. It compels you to think, defy the idea, dismiss the incredible and stupid sounding theory and you search for explanation in the quest for which you start admiring how beautifully the idea is defended. This is the kind of movie that takes you to another dimension and question the myths, the realities and faith.I always rated movies secondary to books, in terms of how they can present an idea and can be intellectually challenging.

But, as well as this is written AND ITS WRITTEN VERY WELL the central character is, in the end, simply uncompelling. He seems blank at the most intense emotional moments and, again, I understand that choice but it renders the impact of the story tepidly. One finds ones-self unable to feel great empathy for John (the lead) and without that, the conflict seems contrived.The supporting cast is simply stellar and each thoughtfully and perceptively fills their position within the conflict in a truly inspiring way. Even the quieter roles make up for it in a moment of insight or impact. I don't see how it could be much better.To the lead actor - I wish I knew your choices had been determined by a Director.

I don't want to sound too negative, so I have to admit that, if you look very closely, you can even find some plot around the holes.

Don't get me wrong; I loved the idea and approach of this movie, very refreshing. I also thought it had some very good dialogue here and there and had its moments - but as a movie overall? Sorry, no thanks; ultimately it was underwhelming and often I thought just clumsily executed. For one, there was for me a lack of believability, and I don't mean about the premise of the main character. I didn't generally find the characters very likable or even believable within themselves - eg the clichéd, wise-cracking Harry. And why were Art and Linda even there? They added precious little to the story. Further, it was at times hard to believe these people were friends at all, let alone good ones. They (and so the movie) just didn't have a ""chemistry"" to me; it had a sort of disjointed feeling. I also think it was in part a thinly veiled excuse to rip on Christianity; gee there's something new (for the record I am agnostic). I couldn't help rolling my eyes and going ""oh brother"" when that part emerged. In short, I loved what this movie tried to do, but felt that too often it was clumsy, even amateurish, in its execution and ultimately just didn't work. Frankly I think this is the kind of movie that some people embrace or overrate because of its attempted ""intellectual nature,"" ie as a way to go ""see, it's intellectual and I like it, so I'm intellectual."" The fact that the author was a popular sci fi writer and this was his last work (completed on his deathbed) might not have hurt either. In short, it's easy to see why this would be trendy to like.

Without giving away any plot points, I'll just say it presents a fascinating premise explored from all angles with interesting characters. It plays a bit like a low budget TV movie, but again, this movie isn't about polished showiness, it's about ideas. Not all movies about people sitting in a room and talking can hold one's attention.

As one hapless character states, ""It was a beautiful idea"", but the end result is very disappointing. While the device of the 14,000 year-old man is an interesting one, the central character, John Oldman, comes across as tiresome and humourless, and his supporting characters, who serve only to tease out the rather trite philosophical ideas discussed in the film, are lifeless caricatures. The dialogue is both predictable and unrealistic; I've never met people who are so uninterested in themselves they'll spend an entire afternoon at a party without ever talking about their own lives, but this bunch obediently behave as an attentive, if critical, audience for Oldman's story. The film is shot essentially like a stage play; most of the action is confined to one room and the actors struggle with the unidimensional roles they've been given, particularly the women, who seem primarily to act as supports for Oldman-as-prophet's rather flaccid and unconvincing claim to virility. The whole narrative unfolds like the scene in an Agatha Christie novel where Poirot gathers the suspects together and reveals the murderer, only without the suspense.I have no doubt that this movie will appeal to some -- fans of Dan Brown and Carlos Castenada -- but viewers who want to see a movie that grapples with the real complexity of human experience, or at least entertains, be warned; this is not the movie for you.",The Man from Earth

This is the first time I've ever written a movie review, even though I am a movie buff, I have never felt compelled to do so; but this does it! How can such a poor movie get an 8/10 rating on IMDb with over 120,000 votes. There must be a glitch in the system, something must be wrong. The acting was absolutely below par, I only continued watching because of the 8 rating thinking something amazing is about to happen. But nothing happened except I lost 90 minutes of my life and another 5 writing this damn review. However, if you enjoyed watching Sondra Locke act then you will definitely enjoy this movie.

Most of the Religious people will criticize that also that something about No faith etc etc. Alos a Little less Comand over Budha, As the character John refers him the best of all his 14000 years Lifetime, he would have been having more referring of his work during his talks.

He also travelled east ""towards the sun"" over the centuries coming to the mediterranean sea and later arriving in India which seems to have moved since those times.His aces in the hole are that he likes to have a fire nearby because it is comforting and keeps danger away, and he can smell rain coming.

480,dazzledvulture,A Response to The Man from Earth,8,20 October 2019,"The Man from Earth is like a guidebook for amateur filmmakers who wants to shoot a movie that tooks place just in one location. No high budget, no Oscar level cinematography but one good plot. Despite the movie is shot in 2007, The Man from Earth looks like a 80's ""B Movie"" and this look is quite the right for a movie that wants the audience to be a part of it.Even from the first scene, The Man from Earth wants us to be a part of it, wants us to think while the characters think, ask questions as characters do, and grabs our attention as the story deepens... The movie is built upon an unfalsiable claim; ""Whether is John telling the truth about himself or not?"" and leaves the decision to us. Some of us will deny it like Art, some of us will belie it like Sandy and some of us will just enjoy the conversation and seize the moment like Dan. Although it may seem that the last scene made it clear the answer to that question, it isn't. There is not an answer to that question, movie leaves the decision to our faith, lets us shape the ending, truly become one of the persons in the room.The Man from Earth has an unique taste that will go on even after the movie ends. It isn't quite like current Hollywood blockbusters, it is nothing like a blockbuster actually, the movie takes it's audience serious. It, in a way, places us as John; some memories we love and look back to it with a smile, we carry for our lives even after living for 14.000 years and some we won't even find it really that important to recall.

481,cparis444,"Poor pacing, direction overshadow great idea",5,26 February 2012,"This film gets a bit more credit than it deserves, as it is not nearly as smart as it would like, nor as many of its viewers claim. The script is fine, and thought provoking, but still not very deep. Occasional bursts of history and science are peppered throughout to give it a sense of reality, but it's as if the writer kept his Wikipedia nearby, not having been armed with any real research or interesting connections of historical events. (This includes the big ""Biblical reveal"" near the end, which one can see coming a mile away, and which lands with a dull thud.) But eventually bad directorial choices get in the way of something that could have been much better. Soundtrack music blares in at inappropriate times, and the pacing is a mess. People walk off camera and are barely out of range before the others start talking about them as if they'd been gone for 30 minutes. At least twice, major characters have very large changes of heart in the span of just seconds, even though the dialog implies they did some long thinking in between. One character pops offstage only to reappear, awkwardly again later. It's as if the script was written for a 2-hour stage play, but the director was under the gun to get the running time to under 90 minutes, or he was running out of shooting days. Everything is rushed. Performances are middling, with John Billingsley's portrayal comic relief character a uncomfortable disaster. It's a character study with thin, undeveloped characters, shoved into a rushed production of what could have been a very original idea.",The Man from Earth
482,begeegs,"Conceptually Good, Poorly written and acted.",3,3 March 2013,"I felt the need to get involved with this film as well. I watched this because I love Sci-Fi and this was rated so highly, but I really have no idea why.The central idea is that a university professor is really a 14,000 cave man who has evolved and lived on. He doesn't scar (convenient), doesn't keep mementos (again very convenient, but awfully explained away in the beginning), and offers no details other than some crude outlines of what happened at that time. Let's not even begin to think that the odds of him not being killed by something other than nature is probably very likely to happen over the course of the ages that he lived through. Oh, and he happened to be around and close to some very historical figures and was also Jesus Christ. So for someone who doesn't really keep a low profile enough to be in contact with some of these people and yet still manage to not be killed from any act other than nature beggars belief.The idea was actually decent, but the lack of prying from these so-called university professors bordered on the ridiculous. The explanations that were offered up were not really thought through enough either. Surely, one would keep mementos when you meet and are close to some serious historical figures - he happened to have a rock from his days as a cave-man and a painting from Van Gogh, but nothing else. That is just poor writing. No photos offered. No other languages spoken. In essence, there seemed to be so much time to get through that everything was literally waxed over and badly.Also, that this cave man was merely just a university professor was a source of irritation as well. You'd think that he would be so wealthy that he could actually hide himself away from having to move every 10 years or actually established a method for the least amount of upheaval. Nope - for a 14,000 year old man, he must have been a complete dunce. Let's also overlook the fact that these teachings that he got from Buddha seemed to be of no consequence to his consciousness. That was also overlooked.So the result is a very stereotypical movie which the central thrust is that Christ was merely a man whose story has been deified and lost in translation that it is now more or less a fairy tale.Now we get to the acting which is probably the most laughable portion of the film. Every character (bar the professor who represents the pro-Christian view) was poorly acted. At times, the main character is talking so lowly that the awful soundtrack is in danger of upstaging him. The other characters are just as bad. Tony Todd has to always have something else that he is doing in scenes, like examining the inside of a cupboard (like you do in someone else's home), or constantly punctuating his lines by slinging a yo-yo (I absolutely hated that. He even did it just as his character made his exit. The last scene of him driving a car, I half expected him to do it). The old man's heart attack was acted terribly as well. It seemed that a 7 year old instructed him on what should be done. Not to mention that earlier, he pulls a pipe allegedly stuffed full of tobacco out of his pocket (his pockets must be full of tobacco).The film is worth a watch, but is this film even approaching as high a score as it is claimed here? Not a chance. It is probably no better than a 5.",The Man from Earth

490,jeremiah-39,"Mediocre philosophy, packaged in a mediocre film with a lackluster ending",3,9 March 2012,"First off, let me say that, after watching this movie, I am fairly surprised to see that it has an 8 out of 10 rating here on IMDb. It started out slowly and was had to follow at times. Shortly after the beginning, once the plot and characters were fairly established, the film was somewhat interesting to me. There were some interesting intellectual points made in the dialog between the characters; certainly not things that I think about or talk about in the average day--and I suspect I am not alone in that--and so watching this movie was somewhat thought-provoking and interesting for me at times. I got the idea about a third of the way through the movie that the writer was interested in promoting an atheistic/agnostic viewpoint, at least as a subtext of the film. Then, about two-thirds in, the 14,000 year old main character drops the bomb: he is/was Jesus Christ. In the film, the character resists sharing that information, and only does so when pressed. But, it is clear that the writer of the film is/was at the time of writing a non-believer (or why would he have written this film?) and is interested in proclaiming that belief through this work of fiction. Just now, as I type this review, it strikes me that even the title of the film, ""The Man from Earth"", is clearly, after watching the movie, anti-Christian; that is, the title clearly implies that Jesus Christ was only a ""Man from Earth"", not God from heaven. I'm not sure why the writer didn't title the film, ""The man from Earth"", (lower case 'm') for a bit of pseudo-clever subtle emphasis of the apparent main thrust of his writing. From the point at which the title character revealed that he was allegedly the one called Jesus Christ during that part of his 14,000 year life, I kind of tuned out, but I didn't turn it off, because I thought the ending must be somehow particularly good for the movie to receive such high reviews here. Well, I was wrong. The movie puttered out slowly, just like it began. As I mentioned above, there is some dialog here and there that many would find interesting. And, if you dislike Christianity or Christians or you have an atheistic/agnostic world view, then you may well find this film overall somewhat enjoyable. However, I feel that this film was mediocre at best, and your time would be much better spent--whether your aim is entertainment or intellectual stimulation--on some activity other than watching this movie.",The Man from Earth

499,duggam,A minimalist sci-fi drama.,8,15 August 2007,"I saw this movie when it premiered at the Rhode Island International film festival. It was the main attraction of a sci-fi block that I went to without any knowledge of what the file was about, save the IMDb plot summary. What I saw was much different than what I expected, and I must say that I was pleasantly surprised.The film starts very simply with the main character John packing his truck, and then joined by colleagues of his who have come to wish him farewell. His colleagues, however, cannot help but express how puzzled they are about him leaving, since he has established himself very well as a professor and is well liked. Each time he is asked, John either avoids the question or gives an evasive answer. He eventually responds to them by posing a hypothetical question to the group (which by now have been established as Ph.D.s in fields including anthropology, biology, and history) about what a man would be like if he had lived since prehistoric times and had the appearance of the same age for sixteen-thousand years. This question starts an innocent discussion, but changes in tone as John implies more and more that the situation is not hypothetical. The group all have diverse reactions that become more intense as they pose questions to John regarding the story he has put forth.One of the producers who was in attendance described the film as a science fiction Twelve Angry Men, and I found that statement to be very apropos. The focus of the story was the interaction of the people in the situation, rather than the situation itself. You will find that as an audience member you are put in a similar position as John's colleagues in thinking about the logistical aspects of living for such a long time and what you would say if a friend came to you with the same story. The writer, the late Jerome Bixby, did this well by presenting people that could analyze the finer points of the hypothetical situation by being experts in many relevant fields. I highly recommend this film if you enjoy the more human side of science fiction, or if you like pondering what-ifs.",The Man from Earth

Kept me interested the whole time.",The Man from Earth
505,bentauer,A psychological journey into anthropology - A modern casual Interview With the Vampire,8,31 January 2021,"This movie is an amazing experience. To me it has the same feel as interview with the vampire, a story of history and experiences over the ages. But the story is told amongst college professors parting ways. If you are interested in anthropology, history, literature, then you will enjoy the experience. Its just one of those movies that takes you for the ride you've been looking for. A fantasy we all imagine.This is an independent project so don't expect it to be a blockbuster. It doesn't have special effects it doesn't have a top rated music score. You will know the actors, several of them are very popular but again they are not blockbuster actors.
What it has is an excellent story taking you down the rabbit hole. A moment between friends suddenly realizing something absolutely incredible that right in front of them. If I can sum it up in one sentence, its a B movie with an A movie story idea",The Man from Earth
506,cloudsformiles,Quite well done and suprising,8,3 February 2021,"Really enjoyed this film and the unique story of the main character. I have to admit that it took me by surprise at first as I thought it might go in a different direction but the acting and the small setting of the film, with the professor and a few friends gathered together really helped land the film for me. A larger setting might have actually hurt the film and made it seem much more fantastical.The acting of the main character was superb as well.Would highly recommend this film to fans of indie dramas and intelligent sci-fi films.",The Man from Earth
507,Hikarist,Wonderful film!,10,28 February 2009,"Wow.. I was left quite stunned by this film.. the story was absolutely fantastic. The field professionals added a lovely twist, trying to figure out the validity of John's story..Very much an intellectual film, but if you love a good story, you'll love this movie.. each of the actors got their characters just right, so that I was rather sucked into the film, and held willingly captive until the very end. It managed to sneak into my top 5 favorites less than an hour into the film, if that says anything. Beautiful writing, and wonderful acting. Overall a BRILLIANT film.. it's the best I've seen in quite a while.. well done!",The Man from Earth

Found some free time today and well, why not, I watched it. Boy was I in for a surprise.This is the type of movie that you walk away with something you didn't have before you watched it. Can't qualify that, it's just a feeling you get. I caught myself at various times talking back to the characters and trying to participate in the movie. It's that engaging.Like some other people have said, once you start, you watch it till the end and goes by in a minute, it soaks you up and spits you out with a very thin boundary on your beliefs.I recommend it for anyone who wants a movie to make you think, engaging, something substantial. Two thumbs up!",The Man from Earth

510,kvenak,Original but still slow-motion dumb,2,12 May 2013,"This must be how this film happened. Someone was reviewing a time-travel sort of movie and The DaVinci Code at the same time. The scripts get dropped, put together again and sent on to the next reviewer who confuses them for one work. In the end we have 10 stars for originality but this movie is still painful to watch. The acting isn't bad and the story has some promise. But for starters the movie drags constantly with pointless repetition and too much empty space. Slow, slow, slo-o-w-w-w. The real problem however, is that it is completely agenda-driven. The entire movie is simply a vehicle for preaching an unexamined atheistic (and in particular anti-Bible) agenda, legitimized by a veneer of intelligence via a cast of academics. Unfortunately the simplistic pseudo-history, philosophical presuppositions and outright errors in biblical criticism move this film well beyond boring and deep into insulting. Think the intellectual equivalent of steam engines on the USS Enterprise, or again, The DaVinci Code. Even if one can stomach the shallow philosophical nonsense (and there is no other reason for this movie), the execution is too tedious for words. This movie is a profound waste of time.",The Man from Earth

Low budget Sci Fi is not a place you usually find films worth your ever precious time. So then, Man from Earth is a diamond in that rough!The film revolves around a central theme, which is how do we disprove or prove anything. Sounds easy right? This film my well challenge that idea.I won't give away any plot details, but just watch the film with an open mind. If you like it, then make sure you buy a copy. The makers of this film deserve support!

512,alleylights,A theatrical play turned feature film? Needs revision.,6,1 June 2008,"It was one of those movies that made me cringe right off the bat for poorly written dialog, development of characters, and cliché directing choices...but I couldn't stop watching it.My background is theatre, and I just kept thinking it sounded like a read-through of a 2nd draft script. The ideas are there, and carefully thought through and developed, but the dialog is weak and often forced. The writer tries to bring us into this world fast, but the emotions that he is trying to have us accept are not well planned or timed.I don't blame the actors, although I thought some delivery was poor...but the writing should have aided them more with that. And I blame the director too, the shots of John looking off into the distance while people talked around him or at him were cheesy.As a fan of movies like Gattaca, Children of Men, and what i consider a somewhat similar movie Last Night(although i don't know why i think that), I can't understand the 8.3 rating...except that I think it's given based on the ideas and not the actual movie. It was poorly executed, and the dialog needed revision. Don't use the excuse of lack of budget, it didn't need one. I would be happy sitting in that room or in a theater watching this exchange of ideas unfold on a living room couch, but it needed an editor. This is a real world, with educated people sitting in a room talking? I just didn't buy it.I'd love to see this worked on again and revisited, on film, a stage, or in a book...it is a neat concept. Enjoy it the way I did, thinking about it as a cold read in some guys house in the woods.",The Man from Earth

It's THE movie which will make you keep on thinking about it again and again for the rest of your life. The environment set to perfection Story building at the finest pace Acting as real as it gets (except a few reactions) Dialogues are thrown at bullseye and the story unfolds a lot of knowledge about almost all the aspects of Life JUST BEAUTIFUL.

514,zenplace4,"I dare you to watch this, only once!",7,19 November 2008,"This is a rare and captivating film that relies on good old-fashioned story telling, intrigue, strong character development, unique and unpredictable plot, and intelligent dialogue. Not a special effect within 14,000 years (I mean miles) of this movie, and if CGI bunnies with M16s were attacking the White House (they didn't), I couldn't have been any more riveted to the screen than I already was. The Man from Earth defines the term ""sleeper""(ie. great film hidden from the public eye) and is a big winner. If you have an open mind and inquisitive brain, or would like a reminder that you own one, watch this film.What fills the frame during this quiet, unassuming movie are endless paths down a story-line that made my head spin as fast as those worn by the professors in the scenes--all attempting to keep their pseudo-suave acts together, but instead falling deeper into puddles of their own melting academic stoicism, intellectual superiority and rationalized disbelief. I was prepared to rip some of the questionable performances in the film until I realized that the actors actually captured accurately, the flawed and self-aggrandizing personalities of the academic characters whom they portrayed. Were it not for the uneven sound recording, often grainy lighting, and occasional continuity glitch, I would have given The Man from Earth a nine.In the best possible way, this movie's concepts will haunt me for the rest of my life.

What an utterly engaging, thought provoking and intelligent film. One that absolutely deserved the reviews and plaudits it's received. When it first started I wasn't quite sure, but before I knew it I was completely absorbed in the storytelling and the characters, and it's very unique approach to religion and belief was very clever. I can't recommend this film highly enough. But please, don't watch its 2017 sequel.

In an atmosphere where the foundation of the plot is based solely on the actors, their relations, and stories, it rises to become the unimaginable, and stays at that level, to the very end, giving a magical feeling, like you witnessed something that no one else has.One room, with 8 people, where every character is essential, everybody is playing their roles to the fullest, always one step ahead, or behind, just delivering the question that was dwelling in your mind. The only film, that I have seen, that has a similar background is the masterpiece from 1957. - 12 Angry Men.I strongly recommend this film to all.

However, given the content of the film, I feel that the actors did the best they could with the emotions and reactions they had set out to portray. This movie is an EXTREME look into faith, philosophy, technology, the way we learn, the way we think, and they way we perceive things should be based upon our known logic to date. I haven't read the book but absolutely plan to, if only to hear more arguments in the round-table discussion. I was very hesitant to see this movie, and only did because I had nothing better to do. After a few minutes into the film I was hooked and couldn't step away for even a moment. Another reviewer had commented that the movie sometimes made you want to be right alongside the characters asking your own questions to the main character, and they were right. This movie has no action sequences, love scenes, or violence that we know and sometimes love in cinema. All that is here is simply this: a story. A story that questions a great deal of what you thought you knew. I doubt that this movie will ""open your eyes"" to a new way of thinking or spark a revolution in your own mind but I can guarantee that even if you hate this film, you will still be talking about it when it is done, especially if you watch it with someone else.",The Man from Earth

The only way someone could watch this and not be put off by the weak attack on Christianity is if they were looking for an attack on Christianity. I suspect all the praise for this tired theme is from those who were drawn to this movie knowing it was anti-Christian.This is worse than the Davinci Code which at least had some historical references to play with. Once this movie went into Christianity, the plot became so thin, it was invisible.The caricature of the ""professors"" was embarrassing.

I am a huge fan of Asimov, and this could be compared, in a way, with the ""Bicentenial Man"" (sorry for the spelling), but in a much more philosophical way. It makes the viewer wonder: what if someone like John Oldman does really exist? What if there was a man who had seen everything that this world has been trough for the last 14,000 years with his own eyes? Furthermore, i would like to say that, even though there are no visual effects whatsoever, the movie should win an Academy Award for the best script. I hope i have the chance of experiencing this with all of my friends, to see how they react. I definitely recommend the movie to anyone who can think outside the box. However, there is a downside to it: the ending. It leaves to much on the viewer's imagination.

I believe this film only appeals to SciFi fans completely and totally involved in SciFi-ness. I love SciFi but I love good film, more. The film should really not have even been filmed, it might be an alright play, a good book, who knows. The acting is mediocre, script is terribly dry and matter-a-fact, which I think is why SciFi-ers love it. It falls short because it's like a book narration, almost like a text book narration, ha, truly. This film doesn't deserve this much of a high rating for the simple fact that it's not a good FILM. This all said, it did suck me in in certain parts but it was mostly when I laid another window over the window I was downloading the movie on.

Particular sequences added music which alluded to a flashback that never occurred on-screen. This gap allowed for me to visualize the details, a value in story-telling. Anyone who enjoys the genre will be able to appreciate this film. The Star Trek connection allows for a degree of leniency as far as production is concerned (they could've if the wanted to). Being a person enthralled by ideas, possibilities, this film overcomes the independent film shadow, by applying a good storyline, rather than awesome special effects. It is my personal belief that a valuable SF reader/viewer engages himself/herself in context rather than imaging. Do you agree?",The Man from Earth

526,mac519,Is everyone giving this a pass of being terrible for a good premise?,2,23 October 2021,"First off, did nobody fact check this? This movie is about professors who have a dialogue each related to their own subjects. Almost immediately in their first ""intellectual"" conversation there is an extended reference to Christopher Columbus being a visionary and hero for believing in and proving that the world wasn't round...Wut.Eratosthenes first calculated the circumference of the Earth in the 200s BC and was extremely close to perfectly accurate. So not only has civilization believed the earth was round for thousands of years but we've even known the circumference for well over 1000 years before Columbus. Also Columbus never sailed around the globe. In this movie one of his crewman says he was worried they'd fall off the edge of the earth...The science explaining this premise shows shocking little amount of knowledge. In fact all of the science in this movie's discussions is blatantly among the worst I've ever seen a screenwriter have awareness of. Pretty much all of these topics are incredibly hard to watch if you like using your brain. The worst intellectual conversation was that this movie suggests that a certain Jewish man in the first century AD who died on a cross in Jerusalem was in fact a white buddhist... That's not a joke. This is presented seriously.But besides the terrible knowledge of each subject, it's an objectively terribly made movie. There's no way anyone can argue. Watch a youtube clip. It's a 90s public access quality movie. Why are people just ignoring that? I feel like this is crazy land. First time someone opened their mouth I thought, ""wait what?"" The acting is a student short film level acting. Dialogue is just there. It just exists to serve its purpose.

529,hierarki,Say WHAT?,2,8 January 2008,"*SPOILER* Good GOD this was awful! If someone has missed the basic point: it is about a man who's lived 14.000 years, and who is now about to move on. This he does every ten years, so that people won't notice that he's not aging. This time around, having worked as a college professor, he decides to explain his background to his former colleagues. The result is horrible, just horrible.The premise itself is like something out of a sci-fi short-story written by a fourteen year old (it IS based on a sci-fi story of whatever length, but apparently written by a grown and quite appreciated writer during like thirty years or whatever), so that's just unbelievably terrible already. The fact that this 14.000 year old person turns out to be Jesus, having been taught breathing techniques by the Buddha, makes you want to destroy the medium you're watching this on. Of course us being taught a valuable lesson about how we always ""hate what is different"" doesn't exactly heighten the feeling of originality and ingenuity you get while trying to force yourself to watch this.That the ACTING is on school-play level, and the style of lines being delivered can only remind you of playing Dungeons & Dragons in high school does not make it better. Even worse is the retarded ""philosophical"" comments being made time after time, making ""The Matrix"" seem just like the deep, existential masterpiece dumb people think it is - ""so, you're not talking about reincarnation, you're talking about living one life.... Quite a life"" (this being said while they are discussing the HYPOTHETICAL question of eternal or extremely long life, as if this concept were completely new to a room full of high-level academics). This is bad in so many ways, and the popularity of this film reflects poorly on our entire species. I suppose one of the reasons people like it is that it takes place almost entirely in a cabin, and is based only on theatre-like interaction between a set of characters (in itself not a bad idea, something which could probably be done more often). The fact that this is somewhat more visually ""unattractive"" than many other Hollywood productions should however NOT fool us into believing that it is good. Because it is not. It really, really is not.",The Man from Earth
530,woanerges,"Is there a ""Z movie"" category?",1,11 September 2014,"The budget for this film was SO low they had to return all the rented furniture in the middle of the movie. And what's with the color correction, if there was any? I remember, when I was 12, I tried to shoot a movie with my classmates, on a cheap VHS camera - it had the same quality of the picture. The main hero claims to be a Jesus, but why the heck would they pick a B-rated porn actor for this role? I have no idea. I like the music in the picture, however. You know why? Because there was no music. Thank God for that because it would probably be as cheap and ugly as the people who thought that making this abomination would be a good idea.The main plot of the film is simple - a guy brings a bunch of people he worked with for 10 years to tell them that he leaves, and that they're all gonna die soon, while he will continue on living forever. Moreover, this shmack, doesn't feel too much satisfied with the results, so he adds a stunning fact that he's also Jesus, the Christ. What a plot twist! Someone, please, give the writers an award, award for the lamest movie scenario. Is there such an award? Well, I hope there is because otherwise this movie will not get any at all.Obviously, offended, and p*ssed off co-workers call him crazy, and some even start crying, so bad he made them feel, but he doesn't care. He just wanted to tell the truth to someone for once. He doesn't stop pouring everyone in the room with historically inaccurate bullsh*t until the very end, and this is when he finally realizes that he's going to end up in a mental house and the end of this day, so he suddenly ""reveals"" that it was all just a funny joke. So, you guys can laugh now. Of course, no one laughs. In fact, this makes everyone feel angry to the point where they decide to leave.Speaking about accuracy. Have you ever heard about an ocean named ""Mediterranean""? Personally, I didn't. Well, the movie, and all the scientists in the movie believe it does.This movie starts bad, boring, uninviting, and it continues being bad up to the very end. Even the ending itself is bad. One of the characters dies from a heart attack. Makes me think that on his place could've easily be me, along with my poor computer. I'm sorry, my computer, I'm sorry my brain. I promise, I will never ever let you experience such pain again.And what's with the title itself? Even the title is confusing, and in general is just not right for the movie. Man From Earth? Okay? Where is the man from Mars, or from other planets? There will be none. Why is it called Man from Earth? Is it because all the characters are Plutonians, and the movie was shot on Pluto? Nope. It was shot on Earth. The will be no Plutonians here, only few unlikable, boring, very boring characters from 50's. What is the point of this title? Man from Earth, And?... So what? It's like making a film about a guy driving his truck for 87 minutes, watching the road, whistling something to himself, sometimes picking up hookers, drinking coffee, and calling the movie ""A Truck From Earth"".

532,rounaque-saxena,Beware; this movie may turn you into an Atheist,8,8 June 2010,"What do I say about the movie, I have never seen something so short and simple (and not documentary) and yet so wide is its view that one can visualize the whole world with its past, present, and future. I bet you won't stop thinking for about a day after you have seen the movie.The movie kicks off with the sudden moving of John Oldman (David Lee Smith) and the gathering of his closest friends to bid him farewell. But one question is stuck on their minds -- Why was John moving even though he was well established there. After minutes of reluctance, when John answers them, it creates an outburst among people present there leading to a debate among PhDs in anthropology, biology, psychology, archeology etc.John's answer was another question as he asked them if they could imagine a person from Stone Age living 14000 years and still alive, how much he could tell them about the changing world. So the debate begins for everyone is assuming this to be a topic just to be discussed as something fictional. But the visitors are shocked to hear that John is the man they are talking about and that he has lived for 14000 years. His friends, not believing him though, ask him to continue with his ""fictional story"" which later unravels the mystery of him meeting the Buddha and later becoming Jesus.To the archaeologist's astonishment (Dan) played by Tony Todd, John had correct answers to each of his questions. The character of Dan has been played extremely well especially the sudden changes of expression from doubt to astonishment. Ellen Crawford who plays the part of Edith , a devout Christian, does beautifully the part where she is disturbed when she gets to know that Jesus was just another ordinary man who currently is her friend. There were times in between the discussion when people felt that John was actually trying to take away other people's lives and has so far lived for 14000 years giving evidence that his listeners had started believing him. His psychologist friend, Dr. Will, was even annoyed by his story as he was already depressed of his wife's death the previous day.Finally when the topic was going over the line John told them it was just a joke and a healthy discussion and not to be taken seriously. But while talking to one of his colleagues Sandy (who loved John and believed him) he mentioned being John T. Partee in Boston during 1940s who actually was Dr. Will's father which accidentally was heard by Will and he could not take this information finally dying of a heart attack.Direction wise the movie was awesome. Director Richard Schenkman has even looked into day to day details like phone calls, drinks etc. even though a serious topic was being discussed. Also, the movie brings out the important part of misconceptions from past saying that supernatural actions of Jesus were not actually real because he never had done such deeds.Generally, taking everything into account, the movie is greatly directed and David Lee Smith has done excellent acting to complement Richard. However I feel that the movie could have been a little more grasping to distinguish it more from a documentary and also the death of Will could have been directed showing a bit of more seriousness into that scene and hurriedly end it. For me the movie was 9/10.",The Man from Earth

There is NO, and I mean NOT ONE, excuse for producing such a bad movie. Was it due to the low budget? I clearly doubt it. Take Christopher Nolan's ""Following"" for example and you see what you can get out of 70 minutes and almost ""no-budget"".The story was predictable from the first moment he said that he was 14000 years old. I was kidding with a friend of mine and honestly telling him like ""Yeah, wait up, in the end he's Jesus himself"". I fell of my chair, when he really said that. The Characters are completely thoughtless and pseudo-intellectual. I am myself a student of psychology - and yes: there are some major dorks in that field who still believe in father-complexes and childhood dramas as reason for just EVERYTHING - but Dr. Will Gruber is just a bad sketch of a psychologist. The same goes for every other character of this movie - one more stereotypical than the others. On top of that is the crazy Christian conservative - how could it be different - symbolized by an old mean woman. The biologist, archaeologist and Tony Todd are also just poorly sketched ""intellectuals"" and at times I wondered, if Bixby has ever seen a professor in his real life because the character traits are completely stereotypical and made out of thin air.My favorite character is Alexis Thorpe as ""Linda"", student, hot and obviously crazy in love with her professor - who is just as nuts as everyone else with one exception: he drives a bike and looks like a real rocker! yeaaaaah! how awesome is he? At one time, at the end, when they leave the place you can see Lindas blank ass when she gets up. My favorite moment of the movie.As for the great dialogues and memorable lines from this movie:Dan: ""I would kill anyone""Edith (after Dr. Gruber showed his gun): ""Where did he get that?"" (This Movie takes place in the USA an Edith was not so surprised about the giant crossbow in John's cabin... what the heck?)I really do not want to waste too much time on this piece of crap, but a few things need to be said.The plot is too transparent. The scientific ""facts"" are clearly out of a book and are used out of any context. The pseudo-intellectual conversations just seem way too posed. The ending is hilarious. As it turns out he is not only Jesus, no, he is also the father of the psychologist, whoms wife died just yesterday, and who has an obvious father-complex (see my irony please) and therefore dies too. There are some very uncommon gap fillers, containing actions and reactions I have never ever observed at any point in my life from anyone. Another pain in the ass is, that the acting is so bad, that they really have to speak out every single feeling, emotion, whatsoever. Good acting makes the vocalization obsolete.In my opinion Bixby made everything wrong that one could possibly be wrong. And i DO NOT hate it just because of all the reasons the people who rate this film high are referring to, namely shortness, lack of ""action"", lack of location variety or ""intellectual demand"", because there are many many movies that i love who fulfill these characteristics.You want a low budget film that is great: watch ""Following""! You want a one location movie with intellectual demand: watch ""Hard Candy"" You want a brilliant movie without any ""action"": watch ""Coffee and Cigarettes""To all of you who are easily impressed by scientific talk, that you may or may not understand: watch the film again. keep in mind the stereotypical scientist. think one more time what these people are talking about and if in any rational way a conversation like this could be possible. if you still think: yeah, it is possible, than i truly grief for America's university-elite.",The Man from Earth
534,rickdt74,wtf?,1,12 January 2010,"I'm sorry, this was like watching a horrible community theater production. The acting was melodramatic and ""stagey"" and the dialogue was atrocious. There was no chemistry or connection between the actors and they all seemed like they were desperate to ""act"" rather than live truthfully in the given circumstances. Acting 101 was not observed. It's possible that it was due to bad direction. I could almost hear the director saying,""You should be really angry here.""... ""Ok, that take was good but can you be angrier?"". Really bad stuff.

The film has some really excellent mainstream actors in it and yet it's not a big budget movie. Half way through I was on the edge of my seat and towards the end my jaw was dropping.

The use of voice over is blatant. There is no character development so i am not invested in any of the characters. basically the only reason i give it a 4 out of 10 is for originality. They could have done so much more with this film, use some different angles with you camera, add something more to the characters interactions between each other. I do give props to the filmmakers for making a scifi film with only dialogue, but the writing needed to be more fluent. It almost sounds like each character is talking with the same voice.Like I said in the summary, Great Idea, Bad Execution.",The Man from Earth
537,venuvedam,A Thought Provoking Attempt - Excellent Result,10,9 August 2010,"Jerome Bixby's ""The Man from Earth"" is an astonishing tale about a man purportedly 14000 years old. I was blown away by the script. (Jerome Bixby is the writer) There are no heroes in this movie. It is the script that captivates you. And that's sad because, this amazing movie though extremely popular, has not made any money. In fact last heard, it is yet to recover the costs.The producers of this movie, Richard Schenkman (Also the director) and Eric D Wilkinson, made a passionate appeal on the torrents site – encouraging people to go ahead and download this movie. If you watch it and like it, you are requested to make a donation however small it may be. I parted with ten dollars immediately after I finished watching the movie. Such attempts should be encouraged.Let me forewarn you. It is a science fiction movie only in the strictest sense of the phrase science-fiction. The entire movie takes place inside a room and there is no movement other than people shifting from one lazy boy recliner to another. It is actually a dialogue – kind of a group discussion where the ""14000 year old man"" is subjected to a long, strenuous and sometimes scary cross examination by his friends. The dialogue is the soul of the movie.I will stop at this point as any more disclosures will adversely affect your experience of watching this movie. It is not without its shortcomings though. In a crucial juncture towards the end, you find certain complex schools of thought reduced to oversimplified notions and if you are deeply religious, there are chances you would want to declare a holy war on the makers of this movie. However, it makes you think and it entertains you completely. The objective of this movie, if I am not mistaken, is to captivate the viewer and from that point of view alone – it merits a full five stars.My recommendation: Catch hold of this movie. If you like it, donate as much as you can. Let more such thoughtful movies delight us.",The Man from Earth
538,arn-tanguy,"Wonderful scenario, capable of conveying great ideas, and not afraid of going against beliefs.",8,9 May 2011,"I have to say, I usually enjoy looking at fantasy movies, sci-fi movies, that rely on special effects. It is always enjoyable to see space fights, nice action such as in matrix, with some interesting ideas guiding the scenario.I was rather skeptical when I started seeing the movie. To tell the truth, I didn't think it possible for me to really like a movie, in which the whole stories lies in one room. I can't spoil anything, because that would rob you of most of the pleasure of this film. Though, I can say, this is an incredible movie, relying only on a conversation between persons of very different beliefs, and fields of expertise, psychologist, biologist... It really makes you think, and I think it would be a very good thing if extremists (no matter the religion) had a really good critical look at it. It might really well put there beliefs in trial, and some good might come of it.A really wonderful piece of scenario, more than worth seeing.",The Man from Earth
539,alienseekernews,"Beyond Sci-Fi, A movie about the way we perceive reality and possibilities!",10,26 August 2010,"This is not a movie review in the sense of what you would consider a movie review to be, but a review into the way one person's perception was after watching this movie. It is a little insight into preparing you to see the movie in a different way than the way you may have seen it without first reading this. I try to look deeper and get something more from a movie then an average viewer would. I try to see what the script writer envisioned within his/her creative endeavor other then it just being a mere science fiction story. This gives me more appreciation to the immense talent of the writer and for those actors who could see beyond the script as more than just a science fiction story, but instead a story of classic human denials, acceptance, understandings and a real view into how scholars might view reality.This movie will focus your attention to a deeper level and give you insight into a few different pathways of thought. These are the type of movies that I have always enjoyed. Movies that focus your attention into the way we think and the way others will struggle to maintain a certain way of thinking no matter what evidence is set before them. A way of thinking that has been nurtured into them by society and the mainstream educational system. A teaching that most of us are familiar with that does not allow for expanding the mind outside the box of the so called norm. When we are confronted with something that challenges our intellectual premises, (which are the reality of the way we perceive it through our taught learning's), we then find ourselves struggling within our own minds to face something that we were never prepared for and had no prior data ready to deal with. This in turn turns our whole academic world upside-down, which then in turn threatens our intellectual beings that took us years to learn. It is like data fed into a computer program. The computer makes no sense of it without further established data to properly do its calculation and make sense of it all. So the computer rejects the data as do our own computers (our minds), with neither finding a logical place for it. It will try and go through its thousands of calculations, but in the end it will always reject it until more data is fed in to help create a pattern of norm that starts making sense to the prior programming. Our minds are no different with people trying to make sense of something that they never before gave any possibility that such an equation could exist. So our minds have no prior information to draw from (no prior stored data) and it is left with overwhelming confusion and self-denial. This can even lead to a self breakdown to the intellectual being of reasoning.What is logical to our minds is based on what we already know. So nothing can be logical because we really don't know anything. What we think we know becomes obsolete at some point in the future when we learn something that overrides, with further data, what we once thought provided the correct answers. We are always evolving and revising what we thought we knew in the past to new data which now becomes the standard, but we continue to arrogantly think we have all the answers. Science has a hard time acknowledging that nothing is set in stone and everything we thing we know will change and the answers will once again become new. So why can't science learn from their own history that we are in a continual state of learning and the answers we think we have answered and don't need to answer again will only be challenged as we absorb more data and the amounts of data out there will always be more then what we will ever fully comprehend. We evolve and learn based on prior knowledge, so the more new knowledge we learn will always conflict with what we thought we knew to only end up replacing it. In the end some of us realize that we really don't know anything. We are the observers within time and space who will continue to evolve by only keeping our minds open to all things being possible and what we learn today will require we rethink what we learned yesterday. However, without thinking outside the box we will be hindered in what we are capable of learning.When these people are placed within such a situation they have a much harder time dealing with accepting a possible reality then those who have always held open minds to all things being possible. When one has no prior data to draw from to reach a logical conclusion, then the brain will merely reach a conclusion of the situation as being illogical. Not that the brain accepts that it can't be real, that is only an assumption we make through our conscience minds, but only because it has not been given the proper data to arrive at any conclusions other then something being illogical due to the lack of data we have provided it. This movie, while still a Science Fiction movie, is a study into how highly academic people on an individual level struggle with denial and acceptance into a step beyond their world of perceived reality. The movie puts a face on us all too just how acceptant we are to all things being possible or how we limit our realities to a confined area within the box that we are told to never venture out of.",The Man from Earth

Be ready for an emotional roller coaster on some amazing revelations in the movie. It will make you keep thinking about many delusional beliefs todays society holds. The movie is in fact very informative on geography, history and science. It is like seeing the TIMELINE of human beings in a movie. Something other film industries should learn from.

Some pointed out it would be of interest to Sci-Fan's of (which i am)- It is not. It is hugely predictable. Acting is atrocious. Maybe the book is good and it was just poorly adapted.I like an intelligent film and the fact it was set in one room appealed to me. It does not deserve this kind of rating though.He says he's old, they don't believe him. He says he's Jesus. Characters are so stereotypical its not even funny.For a good film of this type...

The entire story is set is one room and is the main character telling his story about how he is actually 14,000 years old and is a very well known religious figure (won't spoil it). That is the whole story with a small twist at the end.Visually it feels much older than it is which is strange, it looks more like Little House on the Prairie than a 2007 movie.

544,Gladzet,Brilliant writing,9,9 August 2015,"I went into this film with no expectations or knowledge of what was going to happen. The title ""The Man from Earth"" vaguely suggested some intergalactic travels or perhaps a story about robots (?) thus you can imagine I felt a bit misled when minutes in I realized that it was a ""talking"" film with no action in sight. However, that did not dissuade me. I really enjoyed having a break from intensely visually stimulating movies. What really makes this film work is this gorgeously written story full of insightful ideas about religion, psychology and most obviously - history (hats of to Jerome Bixby for all that). Some of these concepts are highly sensitive though so I would not recommend this films to any type of hardcore fanatics concerning topics mentioned. All in all, this is a spectacular movie for those not dying for action or those looking for food for thought.",The Man from Earth

Being a gamer, I'm comparing this a bit to Assassin's Creed, for dabbling in history and modifying accepted facts (on another scale, of course) while still keeping it somewhat believable. You will enjoy this movie if you like to question things, reflect on life in general. The narrative line is easy to follow, and you don't need to be a rocket scientist to understand the used terms.

There are some interesting ideas, but the wooden acting and glacial pacing make it hard to watch. I guess if you haven't seen either of the previous, superior shows, than you might think that this was something special. As it is, it's pretty sophomoric.

If you are open minded you will find lots of food for your brain hidden away in the dialogue here.As some have noted this is not flashy, or even particularly well shot, or acted.

A series of sharp dialogues comes mixed with some very emotionally charged responses. This feels like a natural result of an absorbing semi-academic discussion of the principles behind the topics of religion, modern ethics, biology and the matter of the value of human life. ""The Man from Earth"" offers a surprisingly broad and yet deep and very stimulating insight to all those topics and manages to leave the viewer with feeling deep satisfied with the dynamic and rich story in a movie where action does not leave the room.",The Man from Earth

I have seen about a 1000's of movies and believe me I would rate this one to the Peak when it comes to intense discussions. I tried to my level best not to blink my eyes as I did not want to miss a single second of such heightened profound intellectual exchange of historical ageless ideas. Believe me I am sort of an atheist. But after watching the movie I got up, stood in front of the mirror and asked myself ""I look back and now i see i was in your hands the whole time, My Lord.""

551,mcshoe,Definitely an over-rated movie,1,20 April 2012,"I was hoping for something intellectually stimulating. I do enjoy having my beliefs challenged, however this movie was totally disappointing. Tons of ignorant, tired out lines filled up most of it. One of the most important points of the film was that they were all college educated colleagues. However, the poor acting and middle school level pseudo- intellectual arguments used left me totally unconvinced. The relationships were also poorly developed which made it seem unrealistic that in the 14,000 years he had been on Earth he would want to say goodbye, as himself, to this one particular group of people. We are supposed to believe he wants to say goodbye but he doesn't care if he sees his girlfriend or not? It was hard to tell they meant anything to each other at all. Throwing in random famous people from the past to spice up the story got old quickly. I agree with others that the film was an unapologetic work of anti-organized religion propaganda. Which I would not even mind if the plot had better developed and if some new material had been used. Overall, the movie came off like something a smart-aleck fifteen year old would have made with a few of his friends. I mean really, people knew the world wasn't flat! I was seriously offended only by its stupidity. We were also supposed to believe that he was Jesus, but didn't want to be made King of the Jews. So we are supposed to buy into the whole ""I'm just an unassuming guy, the real Jesus was a simple man, Christianity is a bunch of hullabaloo, I didn't want the attention...."". So they drop in a Disney movie level misunderstanding and at no time in between teaching someone to ""fish a little better"" and being crucified does he realize the following he's created and try fix it?

I've seen the actors in this film deliver much more convincing performances elsewhere, so maybe it is the writing. But regardless, here every line of dialog, and every movement felt contrived and forced. Whenever a character would get up and move around, I could almost feel the blocking written in the script oozing through the screen.Look, the concept and discussion of the characters is interesting. I don't have a problem with the overall story. But you could take this conversation to a group of real people that mirror the backgrounds of the characters of this film (aside from the main character of course) and record it for a podcast, and it would be a thousand times more interesting and easier to listen to.Slow films with no action aren't inherently boring.

564,mkveksas,The epic voyage exploring the boundaries of a truly open mind,10,14 January 2008,"Indeed it was like sitting ""on the floor listening to Beethoven""... the music that still keeps playing after the last note.I am still seeing myself ironically smiling after watching just several minutes. This is what happens if you allow for what then seemed the unreasonably high expectations to kick in from the very beginning. Fortunately, as it is with most roller-coaster rides, you can't jump out when it is already climbing the hill. Gosh, I am glad I did not take the risk. At start it was a little bit unpromising, slightly shaky, lacking confident direction for a few negligible moments, but what then followed was a full-speed flight drowning in adrenaline, excitement, and the whole pile of positive emotions.The story is involving to such a degree that as the credits begin you want to buy John another Green Label so that he would continue his story for at least another hour. It does not cease to amaze me how easy it is to relate people we meet each day to John's audience in that small room.""The Man from Earth"" left me full of whirling thoughts which still need to subside but if I was to summarize it in one short message -- the real beauty lies in understanding the complexity beyond perception of reality.Anything is possible...",The Man from Earth
565,halekbotond,The best script I have ever came across with,9,4 October 2019,"Hi, this is my very first review, and I'm just a casual film enthusiast, so this will not be a professional opinion.About how I came to watch it: my brother recommended this film to me, but he did not say much about it, only that a few people are talking in a room. This, plus the title wasn't convincing enough for me to watch it anytime soon, so i only watched it like a year later, but now I'm telling myself never judge something by the title and a little knowledge of the film. After watching it I suggested it to 2 of my friends and they were also delighted by it.This is the only film I have seen that has such a thoughtful and well written script that it would make it's way even as a podcast.When the film started I felt like this is an '80s moovie not a 2007 one, because the cinematography is a bit old compared to that.
I'm not a film critic, but I could tell that the acting was not worth an Oscar nomination for anyone, but I think it was entirely fine considering that it took place in just a house and as I said it would even go as a podcast for me.As we get more into the story of our caveman the film pulls you in and keeps you there with its historic facts and the interesting stories. I must admit, when John said that he is in the Bible, I said to myself ""just don't be Jesus, just don't be Jesus"", and when they find out that he is actually Jesus, I was like ooh not like this. But if you listen closely and give it a thought after the film it makes sense somehow, he lived thousands of years before it, and he could learn quite some healing skills during all that time. Plus we all know how rumors go around, when he healed people, the next country could hear it as he resurrected some poeple. Like when in high school someone said that Monday first lesson will not be kept, the person across the classroom go it as no school on Monday.In the end he left the other people in consideration, whether he was telling the truth or not, which was a great pull from the film I think.Other than the cinematography I only had one problem, I'd say that it was expected that someone would be the child of John from the group and it was a cheap move from the film. But at least they dealt with it in a moving way and Will, his son died from heart attack. The only person left who really knew John was telling the truth is the woman he really likes.I'd rate the film 9,5/10 but since you can't give half points on IMDb I rounded it up to 10. I highly recommend The Man From Earth to anyone who likes to immerse in a film, and has an open mind.",The Man from Earth

567,tom-trabue,Intriguing premise undercut by sophomoric philosophy,6,11 June 2020,"I had picked up The Man from Earth about four years ago, but only watched about 20 minutes before getting bored. After coming across it again I decided to humor the film and watch it all the way until the end. While I enjoyed some of the ideas put forth and the questions asked, many of those questions were provided with asinine answers that were then accepted without debate by presumably educated university professors. At times the film exudes freshman-level materialist philosophy that is so thickly laid on you can see it hanging in the air. Some may see this emerge from a desire to make the film accessible to the widest possible audience, but this is not a typical Hollywood style movie. It brands itself as something akin to educational material, ""a thinking man's movie,"" and it's a shame to see what many believe is one the decade's most thought-provoking films turn out to be little more than a Philosophy 101 study group discussion at one of America's many criminally overpriced institutes of higher learning. Then there's the blatantly ahistorical statements about the Middle Ages in regard to hygiene, scientific stagnation, and the church, all of which are made, of course, without providing any supporting evidence. Such idiocy I cannot defend in any context. Perhaps you may take away something from this film that you had never previously considered. I, for one, did not. If you are the type of person who enjoys a good old fashioned philosophical brainstorming session then I sincerely believe that you can do better than The Man from Earth. Watch Primer instead. Even better, why not read a book? If you get even one solid book on philosophy under your belt, then you will be officially more qualified to speak about mankind's origins than this film.",The Man from Earth

In the movie, the main character, John tells about his experience of 14000 years to some friends coming to see him off. It's really adventurous to see him answers all their curious questions and doubts.Characters are fit according to the movie. They are serious, funny and intellectual.

576,recon_element,Was Almost Great (Spoiler),4,8 March 2010,"Despite the cheesy dialog at the beginning of the meeting of John's friends and colleagues, the premise of the film becomes more believable. I would personally dislike very much to share a ""going away party"" with a bunch of melodramatic dramaqueen characters outraged at John's choice to move away. William Katt plays a very convincing jerkoff who dates his middle-aged students and threatens to have his friend or colleague committed after hearing John's life story. From his first line, you want to slap him. To his student girlfriend after pulling up on his badass- cycle: ""So, do I get an A for Awesome?""Some might object or find John's claim being Jesus as ridiculous, but assuming that he's telling the truth, it seems self-serving. The part that ruined the movie for me was the ending. John is portrayed as a caring character, both before and after he ""reveals"" himself as Jesus, telling the psychologist to ""come back inside"" and apologizing for upsetting him, yet at the end of the movie, the psychologist overhears (either accidentally, or as part of John's plan) the past names John's used, one of which was the psychologist's father's. John's consolation after being accused of abandoning his family by his now elderly son? ""Yeah, I'm sorry, I had to go."" That's it?! You reveal to a bunch of your colleagues that you're 14,000 years old, with an in- depth discussion on history and other subjects, and all you can say to your son (one of many, apparently) is a brief and impersonal ""sorry""?This is either: a) A weakly tacked-on plot detail, or b) A personality flaw of an arrogant and self-righteous character that actually ISN'T at all as caring as his earlier statements paint himself to be. The psychologist dies of a heart attack, and John leaves, seemingly unphased. If the psychologist had lived, I'm sure he would have regretting not killing John when he had the chance.Although John might have left the family when the psychologist was a small child, I don't believe the psychologist wouldn't have recognized his own father, unless there were absolutely no photos of him taken. It's a ridiculous and insulting premise in my opinion, both to the audience and to the psychologist's character.The movie would have been perfectly acceptable without this plot detail at the very end, after the audience has made a decision to accept or reject the character's persona. With it included, I can say this movie is a genuine piece of crap.",The Man from Earth

This is the kind of movie that you get you ask your friends to watch without telling them about the story and after it is done, they have one more reason to call you a friend.The characters are extremely believable, and the conversations were very thought provoking. There are warnings I have seen for people to avoid this movie if they do not like their beliefs being questioned. the movie seems to be a study between belief and disbelief, when we watch the ""harry potters"" or the ""Oceans"" series, we suspend our belief system and take things on face value. I challenge you to do the same when watching this movie then challenge you to not be entertained.As I type this comment I am letting the movie play behind my browser screen. the movie works even without the visuals. it is a condensed ball of goodness, a refreshing take on movie-making, minimalist yet has the potential to make you think as much as any other movie possibly could.",The Man from Earth

Yes, that bad; mixed up time periods and names, selective data to fit the story premise with the apparent hope no-one would point out the many factual omissions that would contradict the script. Perhaps if the script had stayed at innuendo, the story might have worked but as soon as factual names started appearing, the research faltered.

The film begins with an interesting idea: what if a man was 14000 years old? But then it never evolves an inch beyond that point. The philosophical discussions drag on without depth, repeat well known ideas without offering any new perspective, never scratch beyond the surface of what the premise proposes.
In the end (spoiler alert), he conveniently becomes Jesus and repeats some tired liberal soft religious ideas. All of the characters remain without depth, which is quite an achievement when one has a 14000 year old in their middle.

It is one of the most intensely engaging dramas that I have had the pleasure to see. Excellent ensemble performances created believably real characters, each with his or her own fallibilities, personal credo, and enthusiasms.The movie is basically a conversation amongst college professors.

589,mcp2012,Immortal CroMagnon's Revelations,10,5 June 2008,"This is a truly superb film: Script, acting, direction, production values (on a shoestring budget no less). The cast is spot-on, and David Lee Smith in the title role is a superb young actor who enthralls the audience and gets to spread his acting wings (so to speak) much better than the somewhat limited opportunities for him to do so on *CSI: Miami*. Smith plays John Oldman who, at a final farewell gathering with his closest friends/colleagues chooses for the first time in his (rather long) life to reveal a secret: He was born approx. 14,000 years ago, in the Upper Paleolithic, aged to approx. 35 years, and then ceased to age, which is to say that he is not vulnerable to the syndrome we call aging, or senescence. That is, he is, for all practical purposes, *immortal*. He's lived and loved for many, many, *many* human lifetimes, has experienced, and, indeed, of course, been a part of, the rise and fall of various civilizations. And there is one more secret, which I shan't spoilingly reveal here, and which the character John Oldman himself only very reluctantly reveals/discusses, that is a further tribute to the genius of Jerome Bixby, further establishing him (posthumously), as if there could really be any doubt, as one of the greatest ""speculative fiction"" writers of all time, along with his cohorts Richard Matheson and Phil Dick, to name just two other illustrative luminaries of the genre that come to mind.What WOULD it be like to be such an immortal---originating from the Upper Paleolithic no less? To remember what it was like to be, not just pre-industrial, but, indeed, to be pre-""civilization"", to be prehistoric, to have hunted Mammoth, giant ground sloths, etc., to have feared sabertooth cats, to have domesticated canines...etc....etc. To have experienced Hellenistic times, the Roman Empire, the Dark Ages...to have had the opportunity to sail with Columbus...to witness the Black Death, or the French Revolution and The Terror...? Don't just rent it---buy it for your collection. You'll want to return to it every once in while. To savor the plot, the ideas, the script, the superb acting and direction (as well as cinematography)---all on a minimalist $200K budget! It is, as other reviewers, at Amazon for example, have pointed out, a filmed stage play which takes place (at least for the most part) in a cabin's living room, and in this regard is somewhat reminiscent of Hitchcock's *Rope*. And what a cast: In addition to Smith we have Tony Todd, John Billingsley, Annika Peterson, William Katt, Ellen Crawford, Richard Riehle and Alexis Thorpe---each and all at the top of their game, and one can tell that they were enamored of the project, even though they probably weren't paid much (if any) more than ""scale""; they are devoted to their characters, and they do indeed come to life: You are there in that cabin with them as the story unfolds. (And, again, a tip of the hat---and thanks---to producer/director Richard Schenkman, who is, in my judgment, right on up there with Phillip Noyce, Ang Lee and Antoine Fuqua, to name just three of my favorite contemporary directors.) Not to knock the Coen Bros., whose work I very definitely like and appreciate very much, but this film beats *No Country for Old Men* (no pun here intended, btw) by a country mile! This film is simply a GEM, and sails through to its climax and conclusion in a sparse 87 mins. This is a film to be savored like fine wine.",The Man from Earth

This film assumes that all that is written about the Buddha is known while all that is known about J'shua (Jesus) is anecdotal. In reality the opposite is true...we really have little record of what Siddartha actually said nor do the followers of Buddhism really care whereas there is more historical evidence for the life of Jesus and His teachings than any other figure besides say, Julius Cesar. Another problem is that Buddhism and Christianity have conflicting beliefs at their core. Buddha never was interested in heaven or hell or God. His sole mission was to break the karmic wheel of death and rebirth whereas Jesus and all those who knew Him (and even those who hated Him) reported that He claimed to be the unique Son of God solely capable of redeeming mankind back to God. Another problem I see is that whole "" after I was beaten and flogged with 40 lashes and after my side was ruptured by a huge lance and I died, I slowed my metabolism down and while no one was watching I rolled away a huge stone that was covering my tomb and then took out a battalion of Roman guards.

None of the movies listed above could get me drawn for such a following.Regarding the movie, the story is awesome and out of this world like Matrix original movie. But unlike Matrix which relied heavily on action and CGI for success, this movie relies on direction and realism.The way this movie starts in late afternoon and the way time passes and the room darkens and atmosphere becomes more and more sombre is just too good.Acting is nothing exceptional, but absolutely to the point.For the entire duration of the movie you feel as if you are actually in the room and experiencing what everyone is going through. I have till date never felt like this ever while watching any other movie.Ending is just great; almost on par with the ending in Titanic but much more realistic and down to earth.In fact the entire movie is so good that I actually had to give it a special place in my movie rankings.I still say top 3 movies are Avatar, Titanic and Braveheart in that order; but this one is so good that it deserves I always recommend it to be watched with a special instruction to watch it twice on two consecutive days.Hope you all enjoyed watching it as much as I do every few months.Cheers and stay safe.",The Man from Earth

Viewers must engage in the film and follow the story line, which lures viewers in to something definitely more cerebral than much of the pap that's passed off as ""entertainment"" these days. I'd strongly encourage a great glass of wine in hand, with more on reserve. Savor this like a fine musical performance, in the comfort of your favorite chair or sofa, with someone special nestled against you.This is WELL worth viewing, and is probably the best film we've watched from this perspective in the past year.

A bunch of colleagues, scholars, sitting around a room discussing things of a globally important as i'm sure we imagine they do. Only this time, their discussion is earth shatteringly important. What happens if a man is immortal...more importantly, what happens if he is standing right in front of you?For a movie to stand 100% on dialogue these days is tough, audiences don't want that, the general population wants special effects and explosions and sex. There is none of that here. There is, however, wit and sarcasm, anger and sadness, raw emotion brought out in a way that rarely happens in modern cinema. Listen, you already know about this movie. You may have stumbled upon it or heard all the hype about it. Ignore the hype and judge for yourself. It's a great film and to quote another reviewer on a different site, for some it will be a good way to spend an hour and a half.

613,marco-cortese,"Excellent film, important subject matter",10,31 January 2010,"I would go as far as calling it an important film, for its educational value. I have rarely come across a piece of media that manages to tackle the most basic argument that effectively disproves all religions (but not spirituality) in such a logical and methodical way, while at the same time being entertaining.In my opinion, this film should be shown to all first year University students undertaking a phylosophy or even religious studies degree. It's the perfect film for getting students, or any young person, to start thinking about what drives belief and how time twists these into belief structures.As I heard it said recently ""There are five major world religions ... four of them are wrong"". This film will show you that the fifth one is no more valid than the others.The script is enganging and gently starts the viewer down this philosophical road (don't worry, no spoilers here!). It's no surprise that Jerome Bixby used to write for Star Trek as there is a premise the audience is asked to accept which borders on science fiction (besides, Star Trek was notoriously secular in its approach), however, whether this premise is believed by the viewer or not is irrelevant for the appreciation of the story and its message.I can't recommend this film highly enough, especially for bible-belt Americans who don't mind having their beliefs analysed and debated.",The Man from Earth

It's not a 1 either because, flaws aside, it's quite engaging and it makes you think - if only about what it would be like to be in that position.I thought that some of the plot points were a little improbable and some of the characters dialogue had them over-reacting, but some of the reactions to what they were hearing were well observed and intelligent.

It works more or less like this: A guy tells his friends that he's 14.000 years old and then they spend the rest of the movie asking him questions and he tells them stories about his life. That's hardly a stroke of genius.However what makes this movie unique and worth watching is the atmosphere the movie develops around these stories. The movie is not on the screen, it's in your head, drawing pictures of far distant pasts. On this level the movie is an unrivaled stroke of genius and I personally haven't yet seen anything quite like it.This is the kind of movie that works so well because you're completely new to the concept and I am going to add it in my short list of pictures that every person should have seen at least once in their life.",The Man from Earth

Even after all these years the protagonist hasn't got a meaning to his life nor a purpose, he just lives on and is shown to have fears and desires of an average man. Even after so much experience he appears to be naive when addressing audience and placing his ideas across.I wasn't very impressed with the idea of a person who is 14000 years old wandering aimlessly, hopping places and concealing identity to make basic living. I would expect much more from disciple of Buddha, sailor of Columbus or some religious prophet as he claimed to be.Movie is heavily dependent on dialogues yet the conversation lacks wit. Ageing is depicted as a material concept ignoring the growth of human psyche with age.The lead character was far from appealing inclining more towards the unsuccessful grade.

618,vickybamiatzi,Superb! A movie for endless discussions and deep thinking,10,9 November 2007,"It's been a really long time since I saw a movie that captured me, mind and soul, that much. Even since the very beginning, when the whole concept of the movie (a 14,000 old man?) seems too fictional, you can sense the difference in the atmosphere, the escalating emotions, and the question keeps pop into your mind: ""could it be actually true?"" And the fact that everything is taking place in a small living room in front of a fire place among a small group of people -like in the theatre- makes it even more special. It is certainly one of the movies that will provoke endless discussions. Some may hate it due to the controversial issues that it is dealing with, but if you watch it with an open mind, you cannot but admit that ""everything is possible"". After all what is history and religion other than our current knowledge of what happened thousand of years ago and how it was captured through the eyes and hands of other people. Even the science that we know today is just a way to interpret the natural phenomena with the knowledge that we currently hold, knowing pretty well that if the situations change or new discoveries will be made then we will have to discard the old knowledge and adopt the new one. Overall I believe the movie is truly ingenious and mind challenging and I strongly recommend it to those who keep seeking alternative answers to long standing questions that are dealing with history, religion, science!",The Man from Earth
619,elpitiuso,About storytelling...,9,4 April 2011,"9/10 first of all, sorry for my mediocre English. this my first review.When the idea behind a story is this simple and effective, there's no need for great cinematography. The movie reminds me a bit of this Jewish tradition where students gather to argumentate (argue? discuss?) the writings. Or more humbly the conversations we used to have younger, sometimes after smoking funny looking cigarettes. Of course, there are flaws. But doesn't every story, no matter how great, contain flaws? Keep in mind that our whole intellectual evolution has been based on what if's, sometimes for the worst, sometimes for the best. The movie is more about storytelling than it is about dialectic and reasoning. about the creation of myths.So, don't take it too seriously, it's just a mind-challenging and entertaining story, quiet well executed.Its main flaw in my opinion is that it could have been longer and richer in historical references.BTW, the concept is as old as Christianity as it is very similar to the biblical myth of the errant (wandering) jew.I hope you enjoy it as I did =)",The Man from Earth
620,jallakake,Promising content - somewhat lacking execution.,7,10 November 2007,"First of all, I would like to say that I enjoyed this movie. It was a nice break from the mainstream action and thrillers, as it actually encourages thought in its viewers. However, it's clear to me that the movie would've benefited greatly from a larger budget.The movie focuses on the discussion that occurs when a professor makes a claim to be a 14000 year old man from before the bronze period. The others, also professors and experts in various fields, start to discuss the possibilities, the reasoning and the philosophical aspects of the seemingly impossible claim.While it focuses mostly on the dialog and interaction between the various personalities, it doesn't loose it's pace, and it has a strange captivating power that keeps your interested and makes it a movie to actually remember years later.It's drive, I think, can be traced back to the movies span of characters, and their intriguing interaction and mysterious past. When introduced to them, you want to know each one's background and personalities. They are somewhat stereotyped, but this is due to the lack of time to flesh them out - I could see hints to deeper things beneath the surface.The actors do what they can with the script, but I'm only half-way convinced anyway. Some may say that the editing and camera-angles can be partially blamed, and I can agree to that as well, but still I think the actors could've acted more multi-faceted - their acting comes though as somewhat one-dimensional.Now, I have to take on the script as well. The interaction between the characters is, as I said, one of the things that makes up the movies drive, but it's also got it's flaws. The reactions and actions of the characters often seems crude. In that, I mean that they do things that don't seem very logical at their timing. My brows furrowed more than once in disbelief of their reactions.I think the crude reactions can be traced back to the movie failing to give the impression of more time passing than the dialog gives. The movie seems to be in real-time throughout, and thus, the complete movie, to the audience, takes place in the same time-space - about one and a half hours.The story itself could also, in my eyes, been better. It has some detail, but the details could've been less straight forward, the theories and philosophical angles not as deep or meaningful as I would like.Finally, the sound was decent, with exception of the music that was distracting sometimes, at one point drowning out the dialog to the point I was expecting a frame-shift that never happened. The set, editing and camera-movement all show lack of proper professional equipment, but it's not worse than mediocre.The movie has an intriguing base, but it's budget hamstrings it. With a big budget, I can imagine that this movie could be a big box-office success, but this is sadly only wishful thinking. The somewhat crude script and simple theories that can, mostly, be found in elementary-school, makes me want to recommend this movie to teenagers more than the older guard. Still, it's a movie I found enjoyable, if only because of the personalities and its nature.PS. The movie includes a single swear-word as far I could tell. A little strange, and I reacted when I heard it.. why they chose to include it, I cannot tell.",The Man from Earth

The project is very well designed and invested, and I refer to psychology, arts and history research rather than money. It is a joyful journey for an intellectual and a mind-boggling ""what if"" game for any person.

Now while I'm not considered an expert or hold any certificate's when it comes to giving reviews on movies.. I do consider myself worthy of a comment or review... and at the end of the day, it is just my opinion... What I can say is this.. Since I have been a child, and I am now to date of 2009, 37 years of age... I have seen literally hundreds of thousands of movies, and from all different genres... So after seeing that many movies, you kind of see a lot of movies that even tho they are different titles and of different genre's, most movies have the same sort of story lines or plots.. and that's fine, because it's all part of entertainment, and helps to get us away from reality for that couple of hours... But over the years there have been a select few that stand on it's own, and have it's own merit of uniqueness.. and I find 'The Man From Earth' as one of the select few that come to mind from the hundreds of thousands of movies I have seen... so that has to say something of this movie, if it can hold that sort of worthiness after all the movies I have seen... While yes, there has been other movies over the years that have touched on the origin of man or religious views... I must say there has not been one that has covered all aspects like this movie did... And to think we live in a day and age of special effects and big budget movies, and I must say I am a big fan of those.. This movie managed to capture my whole attention and then some, on such a small budget and simple location.. as much of the movie spends it's time in just one house or room... So for one movie to command such attention with such a simple budget and location, it has to be special and outstanding... This movie does get you to think out of the square, and out of what we are usually programmed to believe in culture, religion or about life... And the story line even included these sort of people that we come along in life, and consider experts on the fields of subjects that are raised in this movie... and while it is only a movie, it does prove, no matter how wise or educated we are... really how little we do know... and that is something to think about and pull us back to reality... and make us firmly grounded.. I could talk for days about this movie, but unfortunately this column doesn't allow such time or space... so my last comment or opinion would be this.. don't just rent the movie.... buy it...!!!",The Man from Earth

627,frgough,Intriguing premise that gives into the desire to bash Christianity - Contains Spoilers,5,27 March 2019,"The initial premise and execution of the film was intriguing, and the beginnings well thought out as an excellent examination of what it would be like to be an immortal cro-magnon man, and how that news would be received. But as the story progresses, Bixby couldn't help himself and fell into the worn out and tired cliche that all these ""I'm immortal"" movies fall into: I knew gobs of famous people, and was actually Jesus Christ, who actually is just the mythification of a wise teacher.The story completely falls apart at this point on several levels:1. It completely invalidates the ""I was just an everyman, like all of you"" narrative that story established as its foundation.2. How our hero fell into the role of Jesus: He was an eastern mystic who wanted to bring enlightenment to the horribly corrupt Roman Empire. Except that to our Cro-Magnon man, the Roman Empire would have been a near utopian society compared to what he had experienced up to that point in his life. This is doubly insulting to our intelligence because another foundation of the story prior is that our hero viewed the world from the perspective of his time, and not ours, and so, looking back, he could see and understand things now that he couldn't then. In that mindset, Rome was one of the most enlightened places on the planet; our hero would see no need at all to reform it.3. It is Jesus that our hero claims to be the mythified person of, and not Mohammad, even though, historically, given the reasons for Mohammad's visions (the wickedness and idolatry and brutality of Mecca), it would make much more sense for our hero to be that person than Jesus.4. The Christian woman is superficial in her development, dialog and analysis, in contrast to all the secularists who are deep and profound in their questioning.In conclusion, Bixby had a great premise, and developed it well in the beginning, but his desire to score points against Christianity ruined the potential of the film.",The Man from Earth

But, there is nothing wrong with simplicity.I'm glad to see a movie that proves that one mustn't have a large budget to grasp an audience, as this one must have been modest. However, the acting, which was quite mediocre, isn't what does it, it's the peripheral events within the story... which is sort of stupid. That's what's so great, because regardless of how the movie was shot, acted out or even scripted, fundamental questions and primary reactions arose and were described that I find to be the epitome of man's inability to take in new concepts that will change his world regardless of his imbecility or scholarly stature.This movie is different yet too predictable at major turning points, hence my rating.

632,eidolon_au,the man from earth,10,1 October 2008,"Rarely does a film hold the attention when on one small location. Six degrees of Separation comes to mind... and a few others. What needs to propel such a choice is dialogue - both the integrity, and the interest component. The Man from EArth has both, and more. A gentle, exploration of a very big subject. Having been aware of Jerome Bixby's work from Star Trek, I was pleased to see him expand on the episode of Requiem for Methuselah.All the characters act as archetypes for the eternal questions posed about the possibility of a human living an immortal life. All characters act in a realistic manner, and react in what I felt to be an authentic way.It's a cracking good story, told well, and held with great integrity by his son to carry Mr Bixby's immortality through his writing. I hope this film gets the accolades it deserves. I work in the Australian Film Industry where our budgets are generally the catering component of most American films. It is so refreshing to see American filmmakers do what the rest of the world does - making great films without spending the national debt of a third world country making them. Congratulations to all involved. Watch it folks !!!!!",The Man from Earth
633,viddihelga,Triumph,10,8 November 2007,"This is a brilliant tale and a writers triumph over the thirst of hearing a good story! At first i was not sure of what a was to expect from the movie but like the characters i was drawn into the story. As the film goes on it shorter to the end, i don't under stand why it is necessary to write ten lines about the film, i just wanted to say a few words about it. I don't think it will do very well in the cinema because most people don't appreciate a good story for just that. They want to see some action in the film, but this film does not have much of that in the physical sense,but maybe in the intellectual :) grate movie....",The Man from Earth
634,scifiguy-8,The epitome of good science fiction,10,9 November 2007,"Jerome Bixby's ""The Man from Earth"" stands proudly among the best science fiction films ever made. However, unlike ""2001"", ""CE3K"" and ""Blade Runner,"" this little movie relies not on outstanding set design and mind-blowing visual effects, but rather on ideas; the very foundation of science fiction.I've been a fan of Mr. Bixby's ever since ""Star Trek"", and I must say this equals if not surpasses ""Mirror, ""Mirror"". I agree that some of the acting was stilted, and the music partially drowned out dialogue in one scene, but my family and I were mesmerized throughout. As to my personal beliefs regarding God and faith; ""Man from Earth"" in no way offended me, but rather challenged me. Challenged me with historical facts (several of which I've since checked online, and thus far, all of which appear 100% accurate.) This is a chess game of a film, forcing the viewer not only to listen and to think, but to understand.I highly recommend ""Man from Earth"" to any and all who love intelligent science fiction. A friend downloaded the film, illegally no doubt. I've watched it three times thus far, and I'll be the first in line to buy the DVD (legally =) this coming Tuesday.",The Man from Earth
635,Zorro_Blades,An intellectual roller-coaster,10,29 June 2010,"Not only should everyone who ever wanted to make a movie watch ""The Man From Earth"" as an example of just how much one can accomplish with little money and a lot of imagination, but studio heads should make a point of watching this brilliant movie as well, not only to feel ashamed for the garbage their studios often dish out, but as an example and as a reminder that good movies begin with good scripts.""The Man From Earth"" is about a Cromagnon caveman who never died, who has survived physically unchanged for thousands of years, while his intellect and wisdom have grown. Although the characters never leave the confines of an isolated cabin in the desert, this is one of the fastest-paced movies you'll ever see. There are no dinosaurs here, no fight scenes, no action at all, just an original and dramatic movie with some of the best dialogue to come out of Hollywood in years.My only regret with ""The Man From Earth"" is that it was not longer. I could have sat and listened for hours to the questions that were asked and to the historical responses given. A lot of today's audience won't get it. They'll be bored because there's no CGI, no naked girls, no car chases, and they'll go play X Box.Perhaps it's fate that ""The Man From Earth"" was released just as the writers were going on strike. Jerome Bixby, who also wrote for Star Trek and The Twilight Zone, did this as his last script, and he went out with a bang. He probably won't get any Oscar nomination because this is such a small movie, but anyone who has seen ""The Man From Earth"" would surely agree it's the Best Screenplay of 2007.",The Man from Earth
636,mayaadore,"Interesting subject, boring platitudes and bad acting",5,11 November 2007,"I must admit I watched the movie with interest. The topic was fascinating, but I think the writer could have come up with more original ideas. He did nothing but repeated what we already know from our text books. The acting was - without exceptions - really bad. There was no chemistry between the characters. The dialog between the lovers was unconvincing. The end was forced and not quite clear. The protagonist looked like he had swallowed a frog. I guess he was trying to look dignified or inspiring.. Anyway, it didn't work. The whole thing was more like a speech or a dialog, rather than a story.It reminded me of the Da Vinci code. Both movies are based on (mis)interpreting the Bible. The positive aspect of it is the thought provoking nature of it. Judging by the reviews people are hungry for new ideas, and that is great!",The Man from Earth

Minute by minute my eyes were going closer and closer to the screen. The idea of the film is..unique! Actually i still can't realize what is this what i like most about this film. I really can't realize. That's because it is magic! The story is getting revealed slowly, time by time, but in a very mysterious and spectacular way. The actors are well selected. The acting is interesting and sometimes surprising. You should really watch it! It's 100% guaranteed that you are going to fall with this film. Especially, for those who liked ""K-Pax"", they have just found its replacement!! I hope i could watch so good films more often. In any case, Don't Miss It!!!!!",The Man from Earth
638,AsWeSleep,The best science fiction film of 2007,10,18 November 2007,"They simply don't make films like this anymore. Dramatic, thoughtful, insightful, an intellectual mind trip with a non-Hollywoodized killer of a surprise ending.Some people are describing Man from Earth as a ""book,"" not a movie, because there is nothing but conversation. If so, it is certainly in good company. 12 Angry Men, The Breakfast Club, Glengary GlenRoss, The Verdict, and so forth. Man from Earth reminds us that good entertainment need not require explosions nor car chases nor violence. Good stories are just that -- stories. This is a campfire story, as was long before ipods and television and radio, when people would sit around the fire and someone would speak, and others would simply listen. Also, these characters are intelligent. Their dialogue isn't dumbed down, as so often is the case in films these days, so the Knocked Up crowd can understand it.A shame so many religious fanatics are bashing this film based not on it's artistic merits but rather on their beliefs. For the record, atheists can enjoy Ben Hur for what it is, brilliant film-making, without childish whining about Dawrwin and how there was no real Christ. To the nice people in the Bible Belt; learn some tolerance. Calling a brilliant film like is ""the WORST movie ever made"" does nothing but parade your ignorance.Judging from the majority of the comments, there is obviously a large audience out there starved for good science fiction. I recommend Man From Earth as the one movie you do not want to miss. Be it science fiction or simply good drama, Man from Earth will not disappoint.",The Man from Earth

I used to live in Hemet and i have seen lots of movies at his theater , Hemet Historical Theater. Sad to say, I missed the premiere in Hemet. His father wrote this story in the late 1960's He completed the screenplay just before his death in April of 1998I love Sci-Fi and Indi films and this movie was no exception. Written by Jerome Bixby, who wrote Fantastic Voyage, four classic Star Trek episodes and one unforgettable Twilight Zone episode (""It's a Good Life"", )The Man from Earth's plot concerns a goodbye party for a college professor who reveals that he is an immortal who is more than 14,000 years old.It is a brainy film, without all the million dollay effects you see today to drive the film leaving it up to the story and actors, like the good old days.It's one of the best Indi films i have seen in a while.

640,gray_matter,The history of mankind...,10,14 November 2007,"seen through the eyes of an immortal caveman, throughout the ages. Man from Earth brilliantly challenges logic and religion and science, all from the confines of one room. In the hands of a lesser writer this premise might have made for a good Twilight Zone, but Jerome Bixby has examined every emotion, every question, every insight, and through the simple art of conversation has given us a feature length history lesson for the ages. We leave the experience knowing there are no real cavemen still walking about, yet we are left with numerous historical details that they just don't teach in school. Not unlike William Peter Blatty's The Ninth Configuration, this film demands utter attention from the viewer, and should be watched three or four times so as not to miss any of the rapid-fire dialogue. Fundamentalist Christians may not appreciate some of the historical truths in this film. Not John Oldman's former identity, but verifiable facts ranging from the origin of Moses to the inspiration of Jesus.Godfather and Jaws and Touch of Evil are still my favorite three movies, but Man from Earth is now in the top twenty.",The Man from Earth

I will definitely be suggesting this excellent film to peers. The story is great, the acting near perfect, the character depth is astounding, the music is up to par and the concept brilliant!

All I remember at that time was my grandfather sitting in his room all day everyday. He was so creative. When he and my father (Emerson Bixby)would talk about It, I could see A glow in both their eyes and knew something special was coming. This movie represents the true art of science fiction and I believe It will surprise allot of people on how many different ways entertainment can form itself. It Is well put together and scripted. Great cast...(GREAT) cast. Directer was great and most off all.

Very few movies can move along on dialog alone but this one does and does it well.From the start of a hypothetical scenario the plot unravels into discussions about the very nature of humanity and faith. Even though it falls into the science fiction category it isn't bound by the traditional genre elements of futurism and altered sci/tech with big budge action sequences. Rather a simple idea discussed in a rational and thought provoking manner makes it a more plausible movie.I thoroughly enjoyed this movie even as it left me wanting to know more about ""The Man from Earth.""",The Man from Earth

Just another dumb science fiction movie that gives stupid ideas which aren't even that interesting if I might say. There could have been a potential to this movie, but sitting in a cabin for an hour and a half,discussing about total bulls**t kinda blows this potential. I mean, if your'e gonna bring up false assumptions at least make it exciting enough, put some mystery in it, make the viewer get anxious to see what happens next. In stead of that, all of sudden this guy starts blabbering about what happened 14000 years ago in such boredom that it seems as if he himself got bored from the script.

Once more film makers showed us what multi-million budget isn't everything. Great story, almost perfect acting fitted perfectly with nice music(although in few places music was to loud and I couldn't hear the dialog). I will recommend this movie to my friends. I will also buy DVD on nearest occasion. This one definitely deserves this and more. ""The Man from Earth"" reminded me a little bit ""K-Pax"". Both movies research human believes and cognition system. It's difficult to tell anything more about this film and not to reveal any plot information. If you are that kind of person who is prepared to think while watching the movie - you probably will like it. Deep, involving story, good screenplay and comparably good acting - this makes ""The Man from Earth"" probably the best movie of this year. Just don't expect any special effects.

Their are no special effects, the budget would have been minimal but it left such an impression on me. John Oldman reveals to his friends that he has been alive for 14000 years. He tells them with such conviction and nonchalance (that may be an oxymoron but its as accurate as I can get without revealing spoilers!) that their struggle is actually with themselves for believing him, or not. look out for the big revelation in the middle and watch with an open mind. another big revelation at the end to finish on...I shall reveal no more.

This piece of exquisite art is worth more than 100 other of the so called ""movies"". This is a mind boggling idea presented in a location that pushes you to focus on the idea not the surroundings including the actors themselves. Do not get me wrong, the whole cast is superb, but the shining star of this movie is its idea.The more general knowledge you have, the more you will be impacted by this movie, because you will recognize instantaneously the authenticity of the information that are going around between its characters. This will overcome the normal tendency of dismissing the information as unconfirmed, which may distract you from the essence of the movie. Add logical capacity to the general knowledge, and you will be stunned by every word and dialogue in this movie.To keep a long story short, Watch this movie no matter what type of audience you are, if you have some of the gray matter this movie will find a chord there to hit.",The Man from Earth

Now, with a very small exception, and just like in the case of ""The Fountain"", I wouldn't exactly classify this movie as Science Fiction, but here's what I have to say.Although the background story line has been pretty much laid out before both in writing and in film, there is something inescapably attractive in the way the director chooses to play the simplicity hand in shooting this movie. It really felt like a breath of fresh air from the Hollywood routine.As a story, I enjoyed the premises and loved the mind game it generated. I appreciated the inquisitive characters, as well as the faulty ones - all of them standing for the faces of humanity. I sensed the point that hurt the most and, if personally I don't fully agree with the take on it, I found it worth exploring.As for acting, what can I say: I don't have the training of a movie critic, but I've got nothing to complain of, nothing to distract me from the important side of the movie, except probably the uncanny resemblance of David Lee Smith with Robert De Niro. Man, that was much too much! :) In conclusion, I'll definitely leave Mr. Schenkman a positive message on IMDb's board, and as soon as the DVD is available in my country I'll make sure to have one copy for myself; plus I can already think of a couple to offer as gifts.",The Man from Earth

The editing and cinematography was equally abysmal, as was the music. God - the music!!

I won't go into depth as to the plot, as I cannot find anything positive to say, although, the subject matter intrigued me. I was intrigued by the IMDb plot-line and that was as far as it went.A movie for TV, SciFi? Low budget, stereotypical, are all the thoughts that went into my mind during the first 5 minutes. Unfortunately this continued all the way through the film. The acting is not of a high quality, the characters are your usual US / TV movie stereotypes (Professors / Teachers etc, the young blond girlfriend).One aspect of the film did stay with me, only due to the fact it's a pet hate of mine. Why, Oh Why! Do people from the US feel the need to call Vincent Van Gogh, 'Van Go!', do they pronounce 'Cough - Co'? or 'Rough - Ro'? I'm sorry but that is the only one thing this film left me with.I know a previous reviewer thoroughly enjoyed this film but I sadly found it too much on the side of cheap rubbish.

655,quintilian-1,A film to provoke thought,8,22 December 2007,"A really, really great film! After watching it I spent a lot of time reading the reviews and could not understand some of the negative ones.Just to qualify what I mean by not being able to understand these negative reviews: these reviewers have no sense of what is meant by suspension of disbelief. Further, I just do not understand reviewers who open their reviews claiming to be 'scientists' and 'academics', followed by critiquing this film for it's engagement and open approach to Christianity and it attempts to spark philosophical ideas and debates in it's viewers.Almost all of the scholarly references to Christianity made in the film are nearly bang on with regards to their accuracy to debates amongst practising theologians and philosopherseven the Buddhist connotations and influences have been picked upon by scholars many times before.Other's who make comment that this 'sci-fi' film has no 'action', well you are going to have to look elsewhere for entertainment of this kind. This film never claimed to be that sort of movie and I find criticisms of this type, hard to justify and maintain.However, if you are the type of person that likes to have thoughts provoked inside of you and prefers a film to engage you on an intellectual level, then this film is definitely for you.That said, such a recommendation comes with the proviso that you are not overly familiar with some of the themes touched upon in this movie; as sometimes familiarity can be mistaken and lead to a film such as this, being experienced as an exercise in 'dumbing down'.",The Man from Earth

There are no special effects to lure the ""Fast and Furious"" crowd. There are no big name stars to sell the picture; instead, there is a compelling plot and a great story.Through it's compelling dialog, TMFE asks the impossible question, ""what if every thing we knew about western civilization was wrong?""

But tonight i just decided to watch it after all and man was I engrossed. The movie just pulled me in after a slow beginning.The movie is just a conversation between college professors during a farewell get together. And that conversation is the story itself.

What is truth? It is something that matches our belief system? Did the teachings of Jesus really have an element of Buddhism? Is the 'conflict' between science and religion? or is it between the scientists and the priests? or is it the conflict of beliefs? why do we hold beliefs so dear to us?

660,khal-2,"Thought-Proking , Wonderful",9,30 December 2007,"Thanks for making such a sincere and interesting film. I wish there were more like this one.From an analysis of modern man staged 14,000 years ago, ""The Man from Earth"" is a conversation that sheds more light on the viewer's own existence than more standard fair. Utilitarian in that the movie, like ""My Dinner with Andre,"" so many years ago, is nothing more than a conversation among scholars and friends. John claims he is 14,000 years old, and the narrative starts there with an excellent cast.It's kind of like ""The Big Chill,"" without the gymnastic carnal flexing and catchy sound track (perhaps knowingly so as the director finally opts for Beethoven.) ;)Jerome Bixby is a favourite of 20th Century sci-fi canon, from Star Trek episodes, to the Twilight Zone classic ""It's a _Good Life,"" that existed in pulp before it's triple views (the boy who put _them in the cornfield), also incarnated as ""Charlie-X"" for Star Trek. He was a master of the deft concept, and that skill is certainly on show here.Without giving anything away, perhaps it is more telling that a love of science and analysis that stems from humanist compassion still relies on _some_ absolute and ""supernatural"" truths despite the thorough treatment given under Richard Schenkman's direction, so I don't give it a 10, but rather a solid 9.The movie is provoking some meritorious discussion and some without, so just remember (to the finger-pointers down there) neither did Christ pick up stones and toss them. The movie is an allegory, so be kind to one another and try to learn something, please. :) Khal Shariff",The Man from Earth

With a great story, comes great opportunity! And yet, for some reason, most films in the Sci-Fi genre, either fail to satisfy or promise to satisfy and let you down in the last few minutes.In the case of The Man from Earth (2007), you have a fascinating story that pretty much takes place within one location and throughout the film you are intrigued and caressed into wanting more and more. And for me in particular, who has a weak spot for Sci-Fi and will often accept the dribble and last minute anti-climaxes of this genre, I was thoroughly entertained and particularly curious of where the film would end up.Well done to the production team of The Man from Earth and for movie making hopefuls out there, this is a film to study.

At least 80% of the quality of a movie is due to its writing, and the premise of the story as told through its dialog is thought-provoking, to say the least. So much so that it's the only movie I've specifically shared with my friends in a private screening, followed by serious discussion of the issues presented. A word of warning: if you're easily offended by contrarian views on religion, especially Christianity, this movie is not for you.",The Man from Earth
665,davidlingard,I applaud the writer and the director firstly and justly,10,8 January 2008,"I watched this film last night on a recommendation from my brother, i was told that ""its the kind of film that i would like"" being a huge mystery/sci-fi lover, so i decided to watch it. The film is set in (basically) one room only, with a man telling of his story - that he has never died, and doesn't age..he is the fountain of youth. His story is told to a group of scientists, paleontologists, psychiatrist, devout Christian and biologist. All who cannot prove that he is not 100% truthful and so just sit back and listen. The film reminded me of a similar storyline from ""K-Pax"" but at a different angle... i applaud the writer for this story as it is the answer to a question that has plagued man for an age, ""can we live forever?"". The main character claims to be over 14000 years old, claims to have painted with Van Gogh, sailed with Columbus, studied with the Buddha even maybe, just maybe he is not such an unknown character from our own Christian religious beliefs. Take the film as it comes in whatever way you see fit, but there is no denying that in directing the film, there were a million and one ways to play it out, but a simple link between writer, director and actors showed that a film with such a small surround can span the imagination, the world and our hearts.

One could film this movie in his own garage with his home camera... This is the lowest-budget movie that I have ever seen! First - there are even no proves to the story. Second - there are so many illogical elements in that movie... And why exactly a so old man happened to know all the famous people in the word instead of being just a normal 'unknown' man? I think the author was searching for just a sensation. And I also think that there is no Science and no Fiction in this movie. This is rather a low-quality drama than a SciFi film. And the worst scene - that was the final - I will not gonna tell the story, but the end is just cruel and awful, and also unexpectedly sudden.",The Man from Earth

For those who view the movie, believe it or not. But this is too close to the reality. Those who have open mind shouldn't consider this just a movie. Let your brains work hard.Those who didn't watch, this is not an animation magic. Just a dialog between bunch of scientists. The only gun in this movie doesn't have any ammo inside.

It's not everyday that I see movies like these.I recommend this movie for anyone who enjoys philosophical conversations. It's one of the VERY few movies where plot overshadows visuals. It illustrates various belief systems without imposing. I really loved how it never told anyone to believe, but rather suggests endless possibilities.90% of the movie is set in one living room, but I'd only noticed this towards the end. It's fascinating to realise how so much could come from such a seemingly simple production.Sit back, relax, keep your mind open, and enjoy the film!",The Man from Earth

Some of the actors are terrible, and the soundtrack is sometimes interestingly unfitting.Still, the main characters and the the screenplay kept me intrigued, and as the story continued I didn't want it to end, as I never do with interesting movies.This movie is a little gem that deserves more respect than the blockbuster that have state of the art effects and overpaid actors. The story is extremely compelling and I wonder how huge this movie could have been with a little more money to back it up in the first place.It would not surprise me if it became something of a cult movie, and after searching the web a little, I found out that in Norway it has already made quite an impression on some people who recommend it on a lot of sites.Highly recommended for people who appreciate a good story and doesn't have the ""A.D.D movie syndrome"" where an explosion every five minutes and state of the art special effects is a must to enjoy a good sci-fi flick.A little gem that I hope makes an impression on the bigger names in Hollywood",The Man from Earth

Every 10 minutes or so, we'd have to stop the DVD player so we could talk about whether we thought Oldman was a convincing 14,000 year old. We talked about everything from historic weather patterns, to epistemology. The movie addresses historiography, comparative religion, and almost every social science and humanities topic out there. We even got into a 30 minute discussion of quantum immortality. This movie is so deep with philosophical, psychological, and sociological implications that, much like a Shakespeare play, there are seemingly indefinite ways to look at it. This is one of the best scripts for any movie I've ever seen.The only major problem is the acting, which is really mediocre. I've seen unwilling students in a high school drama class act more convincingly. With the exception of Todd and Smith, the actors really hindered this script by being really stiff and unnatural in all their reactions.",The Man from Earth

Although set mainly inside a small house (a living room) the ideas and discussion are thoroughly thought provoking and slightly controversial, depending on where you live. Its a great movie to watch if you are into philosophy or anthropology. After watching the God Delusion with Richard Dawkins recently I like the presentation of ideas in this film. They are a great way to look at the way religion and history are developed by the perspectives of the people who are involved and then how those perspectives are skewed in the interpretation of present time. The characters took me a while to get on side with but once it got rolling it was gripping, like a book you don't want to put down. I really liked the way it ended too ;)",The Man from Earth

It feels like an elementary school ""must-see"" some mad governmental project funded. The acting, screenplay and overall visual appeal defies any logic. The acting is very unbelievable, awkward, the dialogue seems to be based around some ""educational"" messages, there could not be any mention of a plot, story or individual characters in a common sense of fiction. Anything would appear ingenious in comparison with this film's screenplay or casts' performance.I find it very hard to believe almost 30 000 people have voted for this movie with it ending at 8.1.

I would not recommend this movie to what I would term ""overly"" religious.

The first thing that i loved about it was the fact that even though the scenes, acts, and all the moments described in the movie were not shown visually, the characters narration was almost like a novel, it just sparks your imagination.Another fact about it, that impressed me, was that, as i said in the beginning the set is rather simple, and the scenes very easy to follow, and that contradicts with the heart-breaking(for some), hard, deep, open minded and beautiful storyline of the film.I would give it a 100 if it were possible!",The Man from Earth

Fast forward through it, and it's little more than a group of people talking all night. Watch it, and be drawn in, caught off guard and magically transported into an amazing and profound tapestry, a surprising synthesis of some of the biggest questions and deepest mysteries of the human race, of human history, of religion, philosophy, science, of life and existence. The dramatic premise is familiar and enticing - how do we react when confronted with the impossible, the unbelievable - and this is an evening with a very astute group of scholars and professors, nobody's fools. Yet that is just the beginning. To the pantheon of Verne, Wells and Clarke we should add Bixby, from whose genius imagination came It's a Good Life, Fantastic Voyage and the inspiration for Alien; but there's no aliens here, and no need...an absolutely incredible tour-de-force, masterfully wrought.A must-see for all who think, learn, and wonder.",The Man from Earth

679,michaelcrosato,*spoilers* This was a discussion not a movie...,4,10 November 2007,"This was a discussion not a movie. I would summarize the movies as a look at religion from the perspective of a man who has lived 1400 centuries. In doing this the main character of the movie explains how religion started, evolved, was used to control and his reasoning as to why he is not religious.The fact that this was made into a movie really doesn't do anything it couldn't of done as a podcast drama. The movie was interesting but I wouldn't say entertaining or at least the way I expect a movie to entertain. If I was entertained it would be the same type of entertainment I get from listening to a lecture in classroom or seminar.The movie was intellectually stimulating, but that doesn't mean this is a good movie. A movie has many components to it and being interesting the only one. What little acting was required in the movie was passable. The visuals and sound was what it was, people talked in a room, not too hard to do.The movie never really climax's and beyond the hook that start the discussion that is the movie there is really nothing else to it.

It won't win any Oscars, and not many people are ever going to know it existed. But somehow, this movie earned my respect. The way it is scripted and the way the dialogue is delivered, it allowed me to really get attached to the scene in a way I have not experienced in quite some time with movies. I was expecting an interesting but borderline boring movie, but what I got was a 90 minute thought experiment that was both thought-provoking and suspenseful. I didn't give the movie 10 out of 10 because I felt there was some untapped potential that could have taken the movie to the next level, but it was a pleasure to watch nonetheless.",The Man from Earth

I've shared this movie with many friends, but have told them each to watch it alone. Watch it alone, and absorb it for what it is. Ten out of ten stars. This movie will draw you in with thought provoking theories, and keep you in with religious debates and many ""Hmmm"" moments. I found myself just sitting there after the movie. Thinking.

I'm more of a Matrix, Highlander, Terminator, Start Trek, SG2 kind of guy. I was pleased to see one of my favorite Star Trek characters out of makeup. Really makes you think, in a fun way. I liked how it brought in elements from different science fields, from biology, anthropology, psychiatry. There were interesting thoughts on religion and philosophy that I enjoyed.

Do we need to rethink about it? Is we crossed that point? A man lived for 14,000 year is just a representation of our one concept and from that point the writer looking in to others reaction when they know what happened really. As GOD concept is the one main social issue the writer take it in the last moment and stop there.

I asked if there were flashback scenes or any action and he said no....I couldn't believe this was a good movie with a bunch of talking. So, of course I had to watch it. It was fantastic!

After some hesitation, John proposes a story about the possibility of a caveman who have lived up to the present. He then reveals that he is the said caveman.The Man From Earth is a very unusual movie. It isn't about crime, suspense, adventure or action. It doesn't involve car chases or explosions. It involves a group of academians being asked to believe the story of their fellow professor that he is a caveman. What follows is a film that tries to convince the audience that it is indeed true. What I like about this movie is the fact that it makes you think and proposes life questions and possibilities that you haven't heard of.

Did some one ask him that? Did someone tell him to speak all those languages from all those places? Aramaic at least he would know, isn't it?! Well, this was a difficult story to tell.

I always liked movies with lots of discussions and considering the extensive discussion involved in this movie I should have given it at least 9 from my personal account. But some how I just could not connect myself with the movie and thats what disappointed me, it starts with a good discussion it goes on well, it takes you with itself and then suddenly you feel like left alone and getting a verdict with out your consent. May be its just me who felt like deceived or taking too many things for granted but i must admit that I am more amazed than disappointed by the selection of topic.In brief, the direction is flawless, acting is good, character depiction is good, arguments and connections are fabulously amazing.

688,livingmummy,A wonderful movie for people who enjoy thinking about life as a whole,9,25 June 2008,"After seeing this movie, my brain was on overdrive so to speak. I kept going about the general plot in the movie, and it really got me thinking.The movie offers a new 'somewhat unrealistic' perspective on science as we know it. Any man or woman should see this movie. The movie revolves around a story told of a man with an extraordinary past. The setting for the story is perfect, and the right atmosphere is used to create a brilliant movie.I sat on the peak of my chair for the entire movie, and before I knew it, almost 2 hours past. the movie built up rather quick to a point where your brain was about to implode from an overload of mystery, and dull moments were nowhere to be found. The casting was great, and the various roles played by the actors again added to an atmosphere that worked perfectly in the story setting.I saw the movie a few days ago, and I am still captured by it's story and controverse. Even though the story is somewhat 'unrealistic'. Then again, which part of Die-hard ever showed any realism.I am someone studying chemistry myselve, and have always wondered about science, and have had an open mind to all things that revolve around science. The movie catapulted me into a world where mystery reigned supreme, yet in a way that you don't loose interest. Too much mystery and you loose interest, too little and it gets dull. But this movie was just on the right level in my opinion.I am not the type to like the 'Hollywood-oh-so-often-braindead action movies', and enjoy the storyline movies, or just movies that capture you. This was by far one of my favourites. Only the greatest of movies can rival this one.Like I said before, and cannot say again. The setting was simple, the story even more, but there was a perfect harmony between both, the camera angles simple, but yet again in perfect harmony with the story. Little music was involved, but the constant telling of the story around which the movie revolved maked up for it by far.I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to watch a movie about something as serious as life and science as we know it, and has the rest of his evening left to wonder about what he just saw, trying to grasp it.",The Man from Earth

No crime, no sex, the film is still an attractive one, deadly attractive. You can feel that living alone for thousands of years carved John a little bit sorrow, tired, but still with desire.I kept the DVD and watched it over and over again. Actually this is my first taste of Scifi type, and it's sweet. It tells you that the only thing matters is your mind, special effect, crime is not a must. After watching it over and over again, you may find Dan is a little bit annoying. I guess his role was to lead the audience and explain some idea. A little bit not nature, or just because I saw it too many times. Many characters will inspire you and encourage you to think about yourself. Is the old lady living in her own dream and afraid to wake up? Is it right to wake her up or leave her alone? Where will the relationship between hero and heroine, will they be happy until facing the fatal departure? What's the difference from your status?

I do not say the storyline is uninteresting, but this project would have been better off as a radio theater or a book. The problem is that the picture does not gives the movie any extra dimension at all. I will as a matter of fact say it limit the experience. I am pretty sure your imagination and ability to make pictures in the head is to be preferred instead of what the makers of this movie have achieved.If you expect something else then dialog, avoid it!

As to how special he turns out to be , that one can judge by seeing the film . The man from earth is a story told by the protagonist for his co actors and retold simultaneously in camera for the audience .Its in such a way as to show that a good film can be made without special effects or scenic locales or maybe the director was plain broke . The way the ordinariness of oneself is perceived as a greatness for others stands out as the story unfolds . The film plays with the state of suspended disbelief of the viewer , deftly presenting both sides of a happening in such an exquisite manner that belief and disbelief remains neatly balanced until almost the end. The refusal of the human mind to accept and recognise a miracle when it happens and to remain content with fantasising about one and continuing to lead an ordinary life is a paradox that crucified Christ .

697,aadalia-1,A Great SF Movie,10,3 November 2008,"I've recently seen two movies that really impressed me. I subscribe to Stephen Hunt's British science fiction/fantasy e-zine: www.SFcrowsnest.com. In a movie review (http://www.sfcrowsnest.com/features/arc/2008/nz13093.php) one of their reviewers raved about ""The Man From Earth,"" writing that ""The Man From Earth very probably will be one of the best science fiction films of this decade."" Well, I couldn't help but adding it to my Netflix list. With no special effects and set mostly in a professor's living room, I must agree this is a most amazing movie. It is a movie of ideas not action, so don't expect anything remotely similar to Hollywood. But the ideas and the way they are expressed kept me glued to the story and at times finding my jaw dangling.The screenplay writer was Jerome Bixby who contributed stories to both The Twilight Zone and Star Trek. The Star Trek connection is continued here with some of the actors having appeared in the TV series. I don't want to say any more as not to give away what's going on here.

The truth is truth, but there is always a room for some interesting add-on. We don't worship the god we worship these add-on stuff that fantasize us. he is as simple as truth, whether u accept or not.The movie, is an intelligent imagination, an attempt to make us see the reality which we have digressed from. Man who survived 14000 years has seen all the beliefs being developed from nothing. This actually brings him close to god actually.... oh... i cant sleep tonight...love this movie",The Man from Earth
699,buticone,Low-budget masterpiece,10,8 November 2008,"Jerome Bixby was a science fiction writer in the early days of American T.V. who wrote for some of television's pioneering sci-fi programs. Among his credits are the screenplays for ""Mirror, Mirror"", the episode of Star Trek in that alternate universe where everyone is an evil alternate version of themselves and Spock has a beard, and ""It's a good life"", the Twilight Zone episode where the little boy has absolute power and everyone is terrorized by him. When Jerome Bixby was literally on his deathbed he wrote a story called ""The Man From Earth"" which is the basis for the movie I will now copiously laud.The film version of The Man From Earth is a super low budget indie film starring a cast of actors who reside in that realm of semi-stardom where most people would recognize at least some of their faces, but only a handful of true cinemaphiles would know them by name. With no superstars, complicated sets or special effects to overshadow the story, the narrative is driven forward solely by the performances of the actors and the marvelously written dialog. In that regard, as well as with respect to the quality of the story itself, I do not think it an overstatement to call this film the 12 Angry Men of science fiction.OK, so what's it about? The Man From Earth is the story of John Oldman, a college professor who, after ten years of teaching history at an unnamed college, quits his job and prepares to leave his entire life behind with virtually no advance warning. Beloved by his colleagues, they meet him at his cabin in the woods for an impromptu goodbye party. He explains that his sudden departure is not some sign of trouble, but merely a desire to move on, but after some arm-twisting and expressions of sincere concern he reveals to them that he is, in fact, a 14,000 year old Cro-Magnon man who has, for unknown reasons, never aged beyond his current appearance. He explains that he moves on every ten years or so, when people begin to notice that he doesn't seem to age.The remainder of the film consists of Oldman recounting the details of his remarkable life while his friends, themselves highly knowledgeable academics, try to poke holes in his story in an attempt to determine if their friend is insane, playing a strange and tasteless joke, or if, against all logic and common sense, he truly is what he claims to be. At times this intellectual exercise resembles a dance, at others, a heated dispute. At all times it is fascinating to watch. More than once I found myself wishing I could have been present for the conversation so that I could have added my two cents. It is a testament to the brilliance of the writing and the skill of the acting to keep viewers enraptured for 90 minutes with little more than dialog.The Man From Earth is truly a thinking person's science fiction film, a picture that entertains by spurring the imagination and stimulating the intellect rather than dazzling the eye with elaborate special effects and testosterone amped action sequences. In an age when the major Hollywood studios turn out so much dreck, it sometimes falls to independent filmmakers to produce something truly unique and beautiful. For this I believe that the makers of this film deserve to be rewarded. I would not tell someone to buy a film without first seeing it, since that is something I almost never do, myself. But if you can find a copy at Blockbuster, rent it. If it's available on Netflix, put it on your queue. If you are the adventurous sort who buys movies you haven't seen it's only a small risk at $10 on Amazon.",The Man from Earth
700,joseph-368,"Fossilize this, deep in the Earth",1,2 December 2008,"I had read the summary: A college professor reveals that he is really a 14,000 year old cave man. Outlandish premise, but we are told that as this movie unfolds, we may find it is so thought provoking that it may even seem plausible. Sounds like good film-making to me.Well, I knew within 5 minutes that this movie was in trouble. In the first scene, Cave Man's colleague offhandedly notices a signed Van Gogh painting stuffed between some boxes in the back of his truck. How convenient that he just happened to travel in the same circles as a famous historic figure. Okay, I can suspend my disbelief, surely a 14,000 year old would have had some opportunities to meet some well known characters.You really begin to feel where this movie is heading when Cave Man's decision to reveal himself happens on the spur of the moment. One minute he's about to head out the door and the next he's telling them his secret. How do his friends react? After a few chuckles most of them become angry, even enraged. Odd, why don't they just laugh it off and leave? Apparently they're already so transfixed by his story, which he's been telling for all of two minutes, that they're almost convinced of its truth and are hoping for him to just say it ain't so and release them from this new upside-down reality! Personally, I would feel some sadness that a guy I'd known for years had come to believe in this delusion and I don't know many people that would feel different.But the story progresses and he begins to reveal more absurdities. Not only did he know Van Gogh, he was on a first name basis with Hamurrabi. He travels to India and hey, guess who he ran into? The Buddha, whom he spends years studying under. It's so dumb you almost couldn't make this up. The more he tells the more upset his friends become, to the point where one of them even calls a psychiatrist friend in the hopes of having him committed. As if you could commit someone simply because they believed in a wild tale, not having made any threat whatsoever to themselves or others. They ask him one question after another, always trying to hit him from some new angle, demanding some shred of proof, and rather providing answers, he always counters with some ""can you really prove anything?"" philosophy. Deep, deep stuff here.The big revelation towards the end is so insufferably stupid that it warrants only a pity laugh. This is not even entertaining in a B movie fashion. His explanation of how he learned, under the Buddha, to slow his metabolism to near the point of death just made me want to groan. These people sitting in the room with him, they try so hard not to believe him. These poor college professors don't need much in the way of proofs. But we're not quite done. There's still one more surprise, and it's so shocking it causes one of the characters to keel over with a heart attack. Sigh.. I wish that old cliché would die of a heart attack once and for all.This movie is not ""so bad it's good"". No, it's just so bad. I truly am astonished by the high ratings given to it and I had to create an account just to write this comment. I can't help but think that anyone who finds this to be intellectual fodder is simply lacking an imagination.",The Man from Earth
701,ergin-kesgin,Perfect for humans,10,26 August 2010,"Well, I have been a sci-fi follower--if not a geek--for about 15 years. That is, I started trying to read any good sci-fi available only after three years from the time I had learned how to read. I humbly happen to claim that when I see a literary intelligence in a work, I cannot help noticing--and admiring--it.If that literary intelligence broadens to such an extent that it makes one revalue his/her own vulnerabilities against (and endless questions about) the incurable temporariness of humankind, as this tiny in shape yet vast in value movie does, the result is nothing but a masterpiece.It's no shame that this was Bixby's final piece of work, because every writer would love/have loved to say such a genuine farewell in my opinion. This fact (and only this fact, not the box office hit counters) should have this particular movie labelled as Bixby's magnum opus.To say the least, the movie is: Good for all-time students, who are keen to learn on.Better for cinema students for it's minimality in making great use of little to none setting diversity and keeping it's focus on the story rather than mind-dazzling effects to keep the audience on the edge of their unbreakable seats.Great for linguists, Bible scholars, psychologists, anthropologists, archaeologists... (and more.) Amazing for sci-fi devotees who are looking for a good story rather than a laser gun in the first place.Perfect for humans.",The Man from Earth
702,DreaconD,Great Story Idea poor execution,6,2 January 2009,"I watched this based on the rating here and because the plot sounded interesting. The story idea is a great one, and the dialogue at times is thought provoking in certain instances. Unfortunately with the budget they set aside for this movie that is about all that is great with it(Acting like a low budget lifetime movie, 99% of the scenes done in one room). It is excruciatingly boring, like watching paint dry which I think some of the people on here were sniffing as they were watching it to give it a 10?) In other words save this movie for a rainy day where you have watched every other decent movie out there and there is nothing left that you have an interest in seeing.",The Man from Earth
703,tomas-224,A must see.,9,20 October 2013,"This is proper sci-fi. No CGI, no big spectacles. Just great imagination and a profound story about the human condition, about life itself. It explores philosophical and theological questions in a way only fiction can.Clearly a tiny budget. There is no post production polish on this, sometimes the sound is not great (otherwise I'd give it a 10/10). They did no promotion either, that's why you've probably never heard of it. But it's clearly a labour of love. The screenplay was developed over a period of forty years by Jerome Bixby who has an impressive list of great sci-fi writing including four episodes of the original Star Trek. The acting is top class- I guess that's where the budget went. Good decision.A must see.",The Man from Earth
704,gregorio_soria,What a deception!,2,15 March 2009,"I rented this movie based on the rating that was displayed on IMDb. Normally it works quite well... not this time! Rarely have I seen worse acting, worse photography, worse directing and worse adapted script to the screen. The main character almost didn't change the tone of his voice during the whole movie, maintaining a sanctified-poker-face across all of it even when pointed at with a revolver. But the rest of the actors were just as bad with maybe one exception, John Billingsley was fine, doing the best he could with a cardboard ""adaption"" of a script that might be well read in a book but not on a film. But the problem was not only the acting, to start with, I don't know what hardware these guys have used, but the image definition was very poor (or the editing ruined it). Not only that, lighting looked like the one used in cheap Mexican soap operas, with strong sideways light burning the faces of the characters, even when, supposedly, the sun was setting down. Like these, there are several details that make this movie look amateurish to say the least. So why does it have more than 8 points on IMDb? I can only think that there is a strong presence of the geeky-intellectualoid type of readers here. Anything that looks like a well built historical-sci-fi script will rate well, even if the movie is just a piece of crap. I gave the movie two stars, one for Billingsley and another one for the book.",The Man from Earth
705,davidsimonlevy,My 1 is really a 10 on the ironic enjoyment scale,1,28 February 2011,"If you saw this movie and consider it controversial or offensive, stop reading this now because I could care less about the laughable ""controversy"" and instead am wholly focused on this movie as a grand artistic failure.This came as a Netflix recommendation, which in retrospect has me seriously considering that their recommendations formula takes ironic enjoyment into account.Plot intro and formal panning: John Oldman tells his professor buddies that he's leaving, not coming back, and isn't sure where he's going. They ask why, and he doesn't produce a good reason. After them just asking a bit more(ie without creating an urgent motivation to answer or calling to mind any sort of motivating feeling that the audience that the audience is privy to) he tells them that he has never told the following to anyone, ever: that he was originally a Cro-Magnon, and is about 14,000 years old. Think about that. 14,000 years went by and he never once told anyone that he can't die? And assuming that that is true, he now divulges his secret just because a few people(who don't seem all that close with him) gently prod?Now you could say, ""well, maybe he just had enough of being secretive."" Bullshit. The movie doesn't give us any inkling of him trying to hold back. It's just ""Honey, we're out of milk. Oh, and I've never told anyone this ever, but I'm 14,000 years old. Do you want me to pick up cat food?"" Response? ""Fancy Feast."" That's essentially it.I won't even go into the shockers, but trust me when I say that they're absolutely adorable. Oh, and did I mention that the movie about the 14,000 year old man contains no flashbacks? Moving furniture is as high as the action gets.How did this movie attain an 8.0 with close to 40,000 votes? I'm no conspiracy theorist, but I'm inclined to believe that there's some vote rigging going on. I kind of doubt that 40,000 people have even seen it. The sad thing is, I would probably have given this a 7 just out of the sheer enjoyment I got from it, however ironic it was, but my urge to right a wrong is stronger than giving a sincere 7 star recommendation for ironic enjoyment.On a side note, see the trailer, whether or not you've seen the movie. It's really well done.",The Man from Earth

707,wilsondouglas1111,Phenomenal story...,10,8 March 2009,"I'm not a comic-con guy. I'm just a lover of science fiction since I was a young child, writing stories and letters to NASA astronauts. Science has always been my first love in study.Of course when I saw this in a set of videos, I was unfamiliar with the author Bixby, and I didn't recognize the names of any of the actors. Still, the story was intriguing and I picked it up, ecstatic to see the 8.1 rating here because these are few and far between and it was the first of three movies I rented this night.I was so happy to have this story as part of my repertoire of watched movies and actually re-signed up to IMDb to make this comment, because my old personna, x111b3825, well, I couldn't remember the password or what e-mail I used last I typed here and I just had to recommend this.This is not typical sci-fi. It is a dialog driven drama, purely and beautifully woven from the lead character's experience and his defense of his first time revealed story to his current band of friends.There are no laser fights, no space ships, no battles for the human race, just the simple story of a what if...what if I were born in cave-dwelling times and survived until now at this apparent age and experienced thousands of lifetimes in just this one. What if? It's a great idea and like Philip K. Dick who gave us some really awesome stories over his years, I hope to see some more come out of Bixby and family.This one was definitely two big thumbs up and really deserved some better marketing even though the original budget I saw somewhere was only $200,000 dollars.In the extras, Bixby's son and the director told how they wanted to keep this low budget, but there are a lot of us geeks out here, who love sci-fi on so many levels, this movie probably made some money, but with a broad release, wow, no one could say it was not deservedly so...Watch and I think you'll agree.

I will be watching for more releases from these people, because I think they were worth the $10.00 that I sent in by Paypal.This work was similar to a good surveillance tape at a mall.

When I was watching the movie I searched multiple times in Wikipedia for historical references.It's adjusted incredibly. All I can say, This is one of best movie I have ever seen. In psychological, theological, biological and scientific aspect, It's neither believable not unbelievable. But You can't disprove any of it. Genius Jerome Bixby ensured it. and I am quite impressed.

It contains so many elements that labeling it as solely science fiction would be degrading. I am truly surprised that this was not a book before it became a movie. It will take you on a journey of history with 100% factual information, through the eyes of one man. While one might categorize it as blasphemy to religion; I see it as a wake-up call to the hopelessly blind, seeing the world as a fairy-tale story. I see it as an accurate, rational portrayal of the world, as it was, as it is now, and the doubt we all have about our origins as a species (which will never end). There are no amazing CGI effects, $20 million dollar actors, nude scenes nor gore. There is only the story, using your mind's imagination to paint the canvas, living the life of a spectacular person, as your own life.Buy the DVD and open your eyes to history!",The Man from Earth
713,marketmama,Superb!,9,16 January 2010,"When you see the first shot, you do question whether this is a movie worth watching. The first shot reminds you of a B-movie, done under $5000 and maybe based on a good idea but very badly executed. Wait for fifteen more seconds and you will think differently!From the moment they enter the house, you realise there is something waiting to happen. Something which has waited long long enough to happen and has decided that was the moment beyond which it cannot wait. John starts his story. The rest happens in successive exclamations. And as John's story gets more bizarre and impossible, it becomes more and more believable, truthful.Superb acting, fantastic script and very tight yet simple direction has made this movie astoundingly beautiful. Made on a very tight budget, you feel you have missed out on nothing. All the treats are in the dialogues, all the action is in the silence, all the humour is in the crackling fire and all the despair in Beethoven's 7th.A movie which makes you wonder about life, universe and you.

But what it does have is a brilliant story, which is quite rare for its genre.

Looking at the resumes of most of the cast and crew you could be forgiven for writing this film off before even viewing it, but don't - these actors perform at the highest level and seem to have a natural on-screen chemistry. The director was right to avoid flashy effects, car chases and Reality TV-age Smugness. The only science fiction film I can think of that attained the same level of excellence throughout is probably 1997's big budget Contact, written by the late, great Carl Sagan.

I loved the movie that I could watch it more.But the best part was the ending! Not going to spoil anything, the movie rocked that's all.I would love to see a sequel or even a prequel. The prequel could be something about John Oldman telling this to other persons, but this time we get some pictures etc, from his life then.

I highly recommend this movie. Like every unique film i don't remember when or the circumstances that first introduced me to it. Was it from a friend? Certainly not on television. I don't know. All i remember of my first viewing was being drawn in, and like an intellectual roller coaster it swept me up. While watching this movie I am in the room with them. I'm curious, I want to know more. Their questions are my questions, and his answers enthrall me too. This film is a wonderful journey. It's simple and complex at the same time.

Even with the aforementioned qualities lacking somewhat, this movie makes up for it with pure intellectualism and intriguing dialog.

730,ttdog_00,Just...perfect.,10,11 September 2016,"There are infinite mixtures of elements that can make a great movie. Great story-telling happens to be an ingredient in each of those mixtures. The story in this movie is curious and addicting (up until the credits roll), and the method of story-telling is simple and literal. Just as an FYI - I've used IMDb for close to 20 years, and I probably watch 10 movies a week, but I've never taken the time to write a review here. I've only watched The Man from Earth twice, but I had the same emotional reaction after both viewings. You truly are taken for a ride, as are the characters in the movie. The dialogue is realistically over-the-top when appropriate, and it slows down just as you yourself feel like you need a moment to stop and think. The movie could have been made with $10, so don't expect action, special effects, exotic locations, pictures of $20 bills, or anything else that would take more than $10 to film. This is just a great story that rewards you for listening until the end. I'm a fan of good dialogue, so a ""slow"" movie is not an automatic deal-breaker for me. If you don't like dialogue-heavy films, this may be too slow for you. I feel like I can't really mention anything about the movie without spoiling something.

I went back to read the reviews and realized what was going on. 10/10 scores one-time reviewers... how shameful.I hope IMDb and many other ""review"" sites tighten up their scoring, reviewing, and weighting algorithms.

Despite of my messing with subtitles and dictionary I was really impressed with this film and it's dissimilarity to the mainstream movies.

Even though the environment shown in this film is totally static, I was on the edge of my seat the whole time through. The film presents a man who has quite a story to tell and with every passing minute you can observe its impact on every other character of the movie. Filled with immaculate acting and tension-building music, The Man from Earth will keep you interested for its entirety. The striking thing about this picture is the fact that it's about a group of people sitting in one room, talking.

I was absolutely and completely in the moment with the film.I had one complaint about the film and it's a pretty major flaw. Oldman claimed to have been Jesus. What a complete let down. It wasn't offensive and it didn't ""challenge"" any of my Christian beliefs, but it ruined the credibility of the theme of the movie. At most he might have claimed to have been a Secretary of State in Fillmore's cabinet or the first mate to Coronado, but Jesus, the most pivotal historical figure in all of human history?

I must admit that the scenario, the realization and the actors' game are really impressive ! I am also very impressed by the producer's trust in this project. In conclusion, I consider The Man from Earth like one of the best movies I have ever seen. However, I don't think I will need to watch it again very soon, because I will always have it in mind.

738,scarypezsanta,Pretty good despite poor acting,7,3 June 2010,"The poor acting was a bit distracting, especially that of John Billingsley. However I have watched the film a few times now and like it more each time. It is surprising how low key the film remains throughout without becoming monotonous.My biggest complaint is when John Oldman mentions that he felt he might fall off the edge of the earth with Columbus. The idea that people believed in in a flat world that you could fall off of is a modern myth. Every source I can find on the time period and every history professor I have asked says that no one believed the Earth was flat. Columbus had a rough time getting support for his exploration because people knew that his estimate of the radius of the Earth was very poor and it would take much longer than he claimed to sail all the way around the globe.Columbus had a reputation for being a poor scholar, which I suppose is what caused him to assume, despite all evidence to the contrary, that one island he landed on was Japan and another was India.",The Man from Earth
739,vishal_tripathi,The Man from Earth : A Spark of Brilliance,9,22 August 2010,"The Man from Earth is an 87 minutes sci-fi drama that beautifully carries forward the legacy of Jerome Bixby, the creator of Star Trek. The movie throughout deals with questions relating to life, death, history, religion, philosophy and most importantly with the skepticism of immortality. The entire movie is set in the compound of John Oldman (David Lee Smith), a professor of history who is packing his things and leaving the town forever. He is unexpectedly joined by his fellow colleagues who are there to give him an improvised farewell and to demand answers to some of their questions. Oldman's audience consisting of Dan (Tony Todd), Harry (John Billingsley), Art (William Katt), Linda (Alexis Thorpe), Edith (Ellen Crawford) , Sandy (Annika Petersonn) and Gruber(Richard Riehlee) belongs to sundry professions covering various fields like anthropology, biology, archaeology and psychology. The stage is perfectly set for a grueling debate on the most ambiguous and unexplored topics ever contemplated by the human mind.The scene kicks off with one basic hypothetical question put forward by John that 'what if a man from the Stone Age was able to survive for thousands of years and lived to the present?'. Soon the discussion takes a course as everyone assumes that John's working on a fictional story and decide to go on with it in search of some loopholes in the tale. But everyone is left bewildered and confused when John reveals that was a Cro-Magnon from the Paleolithic era who has lived for an amazing 14,000 years and has had the honour and opportunity of interacting with Columbus, Vincent van Gough and Buddha. Then begins the sequence of questions and more questions from the group of intellectuals who try to test John in every field of knowledge in order to prove his astounding revelation false and absurd.It is this phase of the movie that tickles the imagination of the viewer and engages him/her into the paradigm of events which is complimented by both, excellent script and class acting from the entire crew. The subtle manner in which David Lee Smith (as John) answers the queries of his colleagues is a class act. There are timely breaks in the discussion like ringing of John's phone and the interruption of charity group to take away John's furniture. These lapses in continuity give the intellectuals in the room and the viewers to assimilate the events so far and have a point of view of their own.Things get heated up and emotions run high when the debate swiftly shifts to religious affairs. John is questioned whether he was a biblical figure in those times. Although John tries to evade the question but eventually knuckles under pressure and makes some startling revelations that deeply hurts the sentiments of Edith, a devout Christian. But John had an answer for each of their questions and even if they wanted not to believe him, they couldn't as they could not a find a reason to do so. The story has a very peculiar end with everyone departing with a confused mind and shaken conscience. The climax of the story is towards the very end which leaves no doubt in the minds of the viewers regarding the validity of John's story.Overall an exciting and engaging sci-fi drama that will surely leave you with many unanswered questions. Although its an extremely low budget film, its the marvelous script, superb acting and the intensity of discussions that constitutes the real essence of the movie. For me its an 9/10 and definitely worth watching.",The Man from Earth

The whole boring thing pretends to be very intellectual but in fact it is only childish and ridiculous. The acting is just terrible, the dialogs are infantile and actors are apparently suffer from that during the whole film (ok, they were paid to do it, but obviously they didn't enjoy a single second of it, and that tells a lot). And then the whole story culminates in revealing Jesus was just one of us, and he started out as a caveman like 14.000 years ago. And fathered, among others, some of the guys on set. Fantastic. This is atheism on tranquilizers, and it looks dumber than a cult about UFO priests. I guess even religious bigots would fall asleep before they could even attempt to protest this nonsense.

745,fucatshard,Disappointing....,4,19 October 2010,"This movie had a promising premise , and it's what got me interested in it in the first place. But in spite of a good premise the execution was poor.The movie is about John , a professor. He is leaving the town for good because he has a secret. He is in fact a 14000 year old Cromagnon , one who has survived till today. At his leaving party he decides to tell his academic friends his secret , and a dialogue which lasts throughout the film starts.Contains bits of spoilers (marked) The intellectuals , the academics of this movie was not convincing at ALL. They are a collection of Hollywood stereotypes ( glasses, elbow patches , geeky, dry humor , student-professor relationship), one that I've to encounter after 2 years of college , and they appear to not know more than (or even less) than an average high schooler. Let me explain SPOILER : The biologist says that if the human body has perfect protection vs the toxins that damages cells and eventually mutates cells/DNA , they can live for ever. Seeing as he is a biology professor you'd think he would mention that cells have an expiration date and the hayflick limit ( it limits the number of times cells can replicate ). Now this isn't anything advanced , I learned it in biology in high school. Also no matter how protected you are against ""toxins"" , radiation and particle bombarding from space will destroy or hurt cells and cause mutation ( this I consider a lil nit picky). I guess you could say this is where the movie lost me. SPOILER ENDThe other ""intellectuals"" aren't as ignorant as this guy though , but they seem to know nothing more than a high schooler either.. Another thing is how easily baffled they are by John's story. And how anything John says can be found in very basic history books (which he admits himself at some point) + some fallacies SPOILER --- ( like Columbus sailing to prove the earth is round..wtf )---- SPOILER END . This is sloppy research guys.SPOILER Another silly thing that kills this movie is how many important figures John met. He met Budda and learned from him , he was Jesus , he knew Van Gogh etc. It's clichéd and unimaginative. SPOILER ENDLike I said, movie had a good premise but poor execution.

But his friends, of course, have trouble to believe the tale, unbelievable as it is, and some protest him telling the story.

749,ian_schuessele,Religious Bible Thumpers Go Away // First part is a review,10,12 February 2011,"The film is intellectual, ingenious, I would say original, but thats only because its the first film of its type i've seen. It most certainly is my favourite movie ever. To look at it, you would not think it was that great, the entire film is set in one scene, the house of Jon Oldman, a group of people sitting in a room talking, there is no CGI, no action, no sex scene's, there is pretty much nothing noteworthy, but is there. There is depth, many interesting and intellectual plot lines, it is one big narrative, its a novel in all senses of the term but played out in a movie. The ingenious is that your imagination can run wild while watching as the incredible performance from the cast makes you feel as your in the room with them as they bounce idea's round the room. You might nearly find yourself shouting out an answer, forgetting your actually on your sofa enjoying a mug of hot tea.I will not speak of the storyline, it is something better experienced for yourself, all you need do, is imagine the possibilities.I know the plot lines off by heart, I know everything thats going to happen, I have watched this movie several times, and not once did I not enjoy watching it, not once was I not fixed and pulled in by the story even though I had heard it before.It may not be everyones cup of tea, there is no flying cars or magical dragons or space ships. It is simple, and yet it is deep. If you like having your brain massaged by thought provoking and interesting story telling, then this is definitely worth a watch. I would recommend everyone at least watch it once......................................................................**May Contain Spoilers** This movie is not anti-Christian, the fact that you bible-thumping cromagnums are ""obhored"" by the ""attack"" on your sensibilities is ridiculous. God is not real, it's as fantasmagorical as Dragons or believing there's been a Teapot orbiting around Saturn since its creation. However this is besides the point, if you wish to delude yourself that fairies or orc's or other fantasies exist that is your right, its called role playing, go nuts. However, you can't go and write reviews about how The Lord Of The Rings is wrongly portraying your beloved orc's. Its a fantasy and both sides are as correct as the other because both are fictional.*Spoiler* ""He was black, he was Asian, he was a blue eyed arian with a golden beard, he was a blue eyed alien, he never existed at all, now he's a cave man."" /end spoiler.Jesus, the bible, and all other religious rigmarole, its all fiction, there may be some basis in facts, there may very well of once been a man named Noah who built a boat and survived a flood. But anyone who has played a game of Chinese whispers knows, stories spread and told generation to generation down the ages can very often change. Perhaps there never was a man named Noah, perhaps he first came into existence in the mind of a mother or father telling his children a bed time story. The bible is indeed real, there have been many version's, and many similar books, records of beliefs written for many religions. It can't be known if any of the books stories have any truth in them, but the stories themselves serve their purpose to inspire or to control, depending on the wielder of the book.My point, don't bring your fictional points of view into the reviewing of a film, it doesn't attack you or your religion, it is merely an entertaining story about a man who has lived 14,000 years. As someone in the film says, ""what a chance to learn"". The story is not about trying to convert people to atheism, anyone with a logical mind can see it is merely fiction designed to control or to inspire, to ease minds (everyone will go to paradise after they die) or to control with fear (unless your bad in which case you go to hell). If anything Atheism is the scariest ""belief"" system (I use that term loosely) that exists, nothingness, after death there is nothing, when I was a kid this is how I perceived death, ""No more power rangers, forever"" The thought of dying has given me a sunken feeling in my gut ever since. Although now Power Rangers is not my consuming thought. Would it be comforting If I believed in Heaven, and after death my life would go on, of course, and in fact I often fantasise about being immortal, it is very comforting, but that doesn't change the fact that with no imperical evidence to the contrary believing that Death is not final, that this life isn't the only one we will ever live, is completely illogical and you certainly shouldn't give worldly possessions or your time to Churches to ""deliver your soul to the afterlife"" because they can do no such thing, if anything, people should sue them for false advertising.Keep the reviewing of the film to the actual film and don't go on about your views on religions like I just did, take the second part of this review as a ""how not to write a review""..................",The Man from Earth

I've probably seen this movie about 4 times now and every time it leaves me thinking for hours. In my opinion this is one of the best films i have ever seen. It doesn't reflect to my taste since i like almost all genre's but still what this movie does to me is question all modern day science,religion and nature even. What i believe the writers of this movie wanted to create was just that. To make you question everything around you. Around 50 percent into the film i started believing him even though i know it's just a movie. I will add that i am not religious myself but like the character Harry says i believe in live and let live.I gave this film a 10 because that's what i think it deserves. It's not a reflection of the general public's opinion. It's just mine. My advice is to see this movie and give your own opinion about it.",The Man from Earth
754,tribio,Mind blowing,10,25 January 2014,"Do allow me to mention first that this is my first review ever.. The reason why I decided to write one? This movie..My first glances at the screen were of disappointment, seeing not that great image quality and some dodgy acting (the first 15-20 minutes, that is). However, it becomes very clear that the graphics will not take the lead in this movie and that the actors weren't cast for their fluent acting but rather for their perfect place in this intellectual and mind blowing adventure that you are about to embark on, once the story kicks in..The concept sounds simple sci-fi: Dude claiming to be very old, living for 14,000 years, and sharing this with some close (former) colleagues.. Those colleagues are, how convenient, all experts in some specific branch: an anthropologist, a biologist, a bible expert, ... So the questions raised (and answered by our 'old man') come from a wide array of the current understanding that humanity has..You don't need to be a sci-fi fan to enjoy this movie actually.. I love science rather and have a natural interest in the way things work and humans/animals think. All you need to have, is the ability to set an open mind and enjoy the intellectual roller-coaster this movie takes you on..There are absolutely no special effects in this movie, the setting is a room with some people in it (with the occasional shot at the front of the house), and that's it. And yet this is the best movie I have ever seen..Said it before: It's such an awesome movie, it made me even write a review here..",The Man from Earth
755,fabian_assarson,A good idea poorly executed.,5,12 March 2011,"As this being the first review for me on IMDb and furthermore, the first review I have ever written in a foreign language - I sincerely apologize for any assault I might to do it. ""The man from Earth"" did intrigue me, I must say. I read the synopsis (which in short words are a man revealing himself to be somewhat 14.000 years old and then arguing for his cause in a room filled with different specialists in different fields), some reviews (without spoilers) and decided to get my hands on the movie. At first, I was thoroughly impressed with the dialog and the effort the author, director and actors seems to have made in the name of authenticity; the film plunges the viewer in to a deep puddle of what is the vast sea of science. We are exposed to theories of ""perfect generation"", religious misconceptions and so on and so forth. And in that stance, the movies offers me a great deal of entertainment and critical thinking. I do believe though, and this is - for me - a VERY important part in order for the magic to work, that the movie fails in a utmost important point. On several occasions, the concept of ""learning over time"" is brought up and discussed, and the question of languages is at the table. Of course, if a man where to indeed live 14.000 years, he must know at least ONE language outside the English one. When he is asked this ridiculously profound question, his answer is ""yes."" And NO ONE in the ENTIRE films challenges that answer. He never proves himself to own any knowledge of any other language, and they just accept it. Supposedly brilliant minds just going ""yeah okay, well.. that's fine by me.""For me, that single episode ruined a, in other instances, fantastic SCI-FI movie. It lost all its credibility, and the film was ruined for me.Good dialog, decent acting but a big gap in character credibility.",The Man from Earth

When I finally sat down to watch it though I was hooked. Yes it does seem boring at first glance; it has no action and is just a long conversation; but the topics covered are so thought provoking. I've never been a religious person, always trying to believe in the simple goodness of man. I have researched Buddhism and found it to be the closest I have come to actually declaring a religion for myself. After watching this movie and hearing the main characters' explanation of the origins of Christianity I find myself wishing that it really had happened that way. Whatever may have come of it, he made it sound like he was just trying to do the best thing. And unfortunately no matter what century or age he would have made the attempt in, I believe the end result would have come out the same.

Though the movie has unusual stories which is highly justified over the movie but I feel that the movie lacks the charm where a viewer would be attracted. I felt like i was in a classroom listening to the lectures. Boring but really makes thoughtful. I feel that the movie wanted to follow the path of 12 Angry Men on bringing all the characters together and undergoing a discussion. I find some scenes in the movie highly non-relevant and useless. If you fall for the title of the movie (The man from earth) and expect really amazing story then I would like to warn you that it can be really a boring experience.

Center it around religion, but ignore the elephant in the room,that humans are nothing more than killer apes with weapons; did he ever kill anyone.....how could he not and survive so long, especially the periods that he talks about. How did he avoid it if he didn't fight to survive? He's been here all that time, and still has all his fingers and I assume toes.

I mean a good enough idea and all but how do you expect people to keep listening to inane questions that group of nerds ask a supernatural immortal about his life.

765,jabbagr,A travel through time and history in 87 minutes.,9,19 July 2016,"What if you were a man that lived for 14,000 years? What if you could witness the living history of the planet? What if..? This is the central idea of Jerome Bixby's highly under-appreciated gem called The Man from Earth. A film that takes place in a single room and is essentially a series of discussions between college professors from various fields. A film so mysterious that will have you glued to the screen the whole time. A film that deserves to be reviewed.""I've done this before"". One of the first things our protagonist says, is actually one of the key elements in the story. We begin following John Oldman (get it?) who after 10 years has decided to leave his position as a history professor at a local university and move. His colleagues however decide to send him off with a party. And this is when our story begins. John decides to do something he has never done before...to tell the truth about himself. So he explains that he is a man that never ages, a man that has lived for 140 centuries. Upon this revelation a cat and mouse game begins between the host and his guests. John narrates his life while the others try to disprove his sayings. Through this back and forth we travel through the history of mankind over the past few millennia, from the Cro-Magnon to the modern era. A journey that takes you through science, art, history, anthropology and religion.At first, the film seems to go around the same topic: ""Is John lying?"". If you focus on this though, you have missed the point. The main message coming across is the sense of uncertainty that is present throughout the discussions. How can any of us be certain about anything? How can we function unless we take certain things for granted? More importantly, what happens when the things we have taken for granted are questioned? The guests' reactions to John's story, cover a wide range of emotions throughout the film. Indulging, disbelief, concern, curiosity, mockery and anger are all present and expressed in different ways.During the discussions you are presented with various historical facts combined with the fact that knowledge of these facts does not constitute an answer to the ultimate question. The structure of the film prepares you from the very start for the possibility that you might not even get one. Yet in the end we see that even for a man who has allegedly lived this long there are still things he hasn't done before. In an effort to keep this review as spoiler-free as possible I will not go into lengths about what is being discussed, and I will only say that it is a chance to see an alternate interpretation of history. After all, as it is continuously repeated by the participants of this academic discussion, ""Anything is possible"".The film does not feature a well known cast and performances are the obvious flaw one could find in it. With one exception; David Lee Smith as John Oldman. The silent and humble portrayal of Smith seems to be extremely fitting to the character and all he represents. He is a man that has known and experienced more than one could imagine and that has given him an inner peace that can be seen by his reactions during the conversation. He is, however, still a human and so when Dr. Gruber corners and directly attacks him, you can see the doubt and fear he has about his own nature come to the surface.There is not much to say about the direction, but the score is very subtle and only present at times where it sets the mood without hindering the conversation. It augments the sense of mystery and always ties in very well with the topic at hand.Bixby's excellent writing lights the fuse that can lead to endless possibilities for discussion after the end of the film. A man who spend his life writing cheap science fiction, finally managed on his deathbed to complete a screenplay that he first conceived in the 60s. The materialization of his idea about the true nature of man, that is the perfect mixture of open-mindedness and cynicism.",The Man from Earth
766,loonislogghe,"Paper-thin plot, executed listlessly",1,10 August 2012,"People hoping for an intellectually challenging movie, good science fiction, or even a mildly enjoyable movie should not watch 'The Man from Earth'.The central concept surrounding the main character does not succeed in becoming more than a gimmick. The writer mistakenly presumed this feature could stand by itself. It fails to spark a sense of mystery, which is aggravated by becoming apparent to even a mildly genre savvy viewer within two minutes. The obviousness of the concept makes the constant incredulous reactions of the other characters very annoying. Some reviewers have pointed out the strength of the concept is its ambiguity, but when one sees the amount of effort made by the writer to uneasily force this uncertainty unto the story, this argument can be quickly discarded.The characters portrayed are caricatures, which is an insurmountable obstacle in a movie in which eight persons are constantly in one room. From the rock and roll professor to the prudish zealot, not one character is realistic enough to be identified with. This is made worse by college professors discussing like 18-year-olds, with a failed attempt to use one student (behaving like a 14-year-old) as a foil. Very annoying is the lack of research. The film tries to attain an intellectual level by name-dropping and reciting well-known quotes, never digging deeper to any meaning in the progress. Some references break every belief in the setting, such as a professor in archeology citing the outdated (by a century) notion of voluntary sedentarisation.Lastly, the lackluster acting of the cast (of which some have shown that they can do better) is painful to watch, a pain which is only surpassed by the ridiculous choice and timing of the music. Together, these failures remove every possibility to take this movie seriously, rendering it nothing more than a (bad) effort.It escapes sense that 'The Man from Earth' is currently rated 8 out of 10. My advice: do not waste your time on this.",The Man from Earth
767,gamerroc,Pretentious platitude filled pile of poo,1,10 October 2011,"****SPOILERS AHEAD**** Lets get the good stuff out of the way shall we: The characters made me smile and the man's story was cute. Despite the fact it was silly, I had no problem suspending disbelief.Now to the bad: The filmmaker's attempt to create intellectuals was laughable. He should have stuck them in a library wearing jackets with patches, smoking pipes. I felt bad for real professors the world over. The character development spirals into the realm of the absurd when one of them pulls a gun. It boggles my mind how anyone can take this movie seriously after that.The ideas put forth are old but feel very preachy. It was like a child getting a new toy and telling everyone, with enthusiasm, to ""look at this!"" Organic living, and especially religion seemed to be focal points, but without actually adding a substantive argument. Just a story. Which is fine if you don't read too much into it. If you do, you might feel intellectually insulted.Being an avid sci-fi fan, I search through various sites from time to time to find new movies, books and shows. After finding this page I was really hopeful about this film. I felt trolled as the credits rolled, and if the same thing happened to you, I feel your pain. I won't speculate on those that were profoundly impacted by this movie. If you want original ideas, try the twilight zone or classic sci-fi novels. If you seek philosophy, there are deeper concepts on the front page of youtube.If you're lucky enough to make it through the first few pages of 10 star reviews, you will find better reviews than this that go into detail on the failures of this film.

768,woodgod23,An excellent film that makes you think.,10,11 October 2011,"This movie really made me think. I have seen this movie several times now on netflix and every time the discussion seems to get deeper and more magical, with a few twists here and there. I recognized some of the actors, John Billingsly I recognized automatically, Even though it's not necessarily a fast paced movie it draws you in. The basic plot is a ""What If"" question, that slowly builds and builds. There are no explosive special effects, fights or other hokum that are traditionally associated with science fiction. When John speaks you can sense an eerie depth to his voice that makes you want to listen, his voice and story draw you in.When I am listening to John I can kind of imagine my self in his shoes, which is one of the most powerful aspects of this film. When he talks of being a pariah among his original people is moving and well acted, as well as well researched.The fact that the other professors are sitting there listening, and debating the points makes it seem genuine, and reminds me of some of my philosophy courses from college.The professors seem genuine, kind of swaying between is he crazy, or is he sane. Some are willing to take that leap of faith, while others are mired in academia, religion and logic. The ending blew me away because of how well thought out it was and how it kind of came out of left field. The movie answers many questions in the end but one question still lingers in my mind ""What happened to John after this event?""If you want a thought provoking movie this is the one to watch.

Good comments about it must be written by the actors of the movie themselves. This movie tries to impress you by the quotes from famous writers but it fails. Tries to tell you something about atheism but fails. Tries to tell you something about Christianity and Jesus but fails. Tries to touch your heart and feelings, but certainly fails. In comments it's said that there is a surprising twist of the story at the end, and it fails. This is the worst film i have seen this year by far. I can understand a few good comments.

789,gxovpgxl,Christians might be offended. This post may offend some.,6,29 April 2012,"***Spoiler Alert*** The acting was well done and it was nice to see some familiar faces. About 45 minutes into the film, it changes from a discussion of a man whose lived for 14,000 years and his experiences into philosophy. John tells his audience that the Buddha was his friend. When asked if he ever met Biblical figures, he told his friends that he didn't want to talk about it. When pressed, he confessed that he was Jesus. Not that he was the Son of God but that Jesus really isn't a God and that he played a roll like many of the others that he has done. From a movie perspective, John doesn't really give the Philosopher-esq feeling that one would expect from a 14,000 year old man who walked with the Buddha and claimed to be the all wise Jesus. I would expect that some really wise dialogue would have taken place at this point. From a suspension of belief, it doesn't quite work. He's not like the Buddha; and he's not the wise Jesus of the Bible. He's just a guy. He's nothing special. Now if you were a young Christian, this might be tough to watch. Some of the standard arguments against the divinity of Jesus are used. Unfortunately, the move comes across as anti-Christian. I get where the author is coming from. Belief systems are based on many things and develop many ways. He might believe that Christianity isn't true. I have no problem with that. There's no material evidence that any belief system is true, that's why faith is important. (Here's where some may get offended.) While it may be easy from a philosophical perspective to say that the Bible was a bunch of stories that where made up, that argument falls apart when if you believe the Book of Mormon to be true. The Book of Mormon testifies that the Jesus of the Bible is the Son of God. For me, the writers argument falls apart because while it could be true that the New Testament was crafted and isn't really true, the Book of Mormon makes that pretty much unlikely. If someone wanted to destroy the belief that Jesus was the Son of God, they could attempt to do a decent job arguing against the New Testament. But the Book of Mormon also testifies of Christ. That person would have to argue against both books. I would have preferred that the writer stick to something other than going against Christianity. It would have made the suspension of disbelief easier.",The Man from Earth
790,dblk2,Excellent Film But Misses Some Key Facts,7,20 January 2008,"A strong film, very thought-provoking. Great discussion of the selectivity and murkiness of memory. Still there are weaknesses in the Bible portion. Jesus was a Jew and lived a Jewish life, worshiped Jewish festivals, observed dietary rules and Sabbath, went regularly to the Temple, wore fringed garments (talit) that Jews wore, and was punished as a Jewish trouble-maker. The film's portrayal of Jesus falls into an old supersessionist stereotype that is centuries-old: stripping Jesus of his Jewishness and criticizing the ""Old Testament"" as promoting guilt.

The most compelling thing about the narrative or the argument amongst the main character and his intellectual brethren is really ""simple"". It is something that can be followed by everyone but neither disproved or proved at the same time. The only reason that there is a certain amount of resistance to the film is when preconceived notions are brought into the picture. The film from the start asks one to leave all notions behind as the only way one can adhere to new ideas.The final verdict- it is one of those films that will force u to think whether u like it or not. The makers have done excellent research and also compiling of that knowledge to the script is done exceptionally well. U just need to have an open mind and remember it is fiction and not reality. so be a little kind.",The Man from Earth
794,danilonsn,"A must, if you like to use your brain. If you just want effects, find something else.",9,9 August 2012,"I must say this is the first time I do write a review. I am not a professional reviewer, but I do enjoy watching good movies.I do realize people seek different things in a movie: acting, plot, the cast, action, landscapes, good music, special effects, and, sometimes, provocative ideas that make them think.It's not inappropriate to say different movies may have different objectives. Some are made to be blockbusters (like Men in Black, let's say), but you don't actually watch MIB expecting to see a romance like Casablanca, a plot like Man on The Ledge. It's just FX, comedy, a good time in deed. You know you have your expectations in place just when you buy the ticket for it. If you enter the theater expecting to see Startrek-like sci-fi, you well certainly be frustrated.I know the best movies manage to score fairly good in all the criteria mentioned above,as much is relevant for the objective they were made for. Again, MIB was not created to show you a window to a different world, as Matrix did and Blade Runner surely did, and that's why these movies are awesome sci-fi thrillers.Well, I do have to say acting in The Man from Earth is not it's strength, that's quite obvious. The cast is not Hollywoods creme d la creme, but you won't feel like watching high school plays either. As a matter of fact, I am incline to like them very much, because most of them were in sci-fi series I've watched during the last decades. The FX are non existent at all, no question about it. Romance, well, it depends of your definition of it Landscapes are nonexistent too, at least explicit ones, but the one the dialogs suggested I've managed to construct in my mind, like I would have to do if reading a book, and, I have to say, I don't mind constructing it in my mind at all What about the plot? Twists? Surprises, suspense? Well, in my reading, I DO found them all, lots of it, actually. I don't need someone running and million dollar explosions to recognize action, and turnovers.The upside of this movie is not how it starts or how it ends, but how it develops itself trough the dialogs, arguments, facts and possibilities. All important ingredients to stimulate my mind , so I can picture a new world, different from what I know, opening my mind to something else. And that's precisely why it's brilliant Overall score do not have to be the average of all criteria. If the objective of the movie is to be mind opening and provocative, AND I DO WATCH THE MOVIE WITH THAT IN MY MIND, I don't see why I have to criticize it for not having FX, or whatever According to the objective, mission accomplished! Period! I don't feel like pseudo-intellectual (as someone pointed out about the lovers of The Man From Earth) because I feel stimulated by sci-fi stories. I do like reading about technological , philosofical, sociological, religious and biological/evolutionary material, but no one is gonna tell me sci-fi is mediocre because there is no laser and visual eye-candy obvious stuff, or even anticipates I'm note lectured because I do enjoy an unconventional fiction story Seriously, I suspect people saying so had a hard time understanding what the movie was about Adjust your expectations,knowing what the movie is about, and you will enjoy it deeply. And if you are not into it, use your time to something else, but don't complain about something not fitting what you wanted it to be Well,overall, it's a must watch, if you do want a provocative time. If you don't, you can always sync with the Warner Channel.",The Man from Earth

They would have probably lynched him. Acting was very iffy at times, by that I mean it was cheesy looking but suited the low budget film that this is.

There are no men (or women) from earth that should consider watching this based on the IMDb rating....Like some others here I had to create an IMDb account just to rate this film because I felt THAT strongly about it. The acting was pretty bad, the story was ridiculous really and there was nothing really to redeem the film save that you were wondering what was going to happen, and in the end nothing of interest did happen. I found myself bored most of the time as the ideas which were being discussed (which apparently others feel were quite deep) were really, in my opinion, just plain silly and in no way believable even if you accept the basic premise that this man has lived such a long life.

Out of arguments, they mostly react angry, burst out in emotions, by the way, awfully acted. It's a movie in a closed environment, and you expect witty conversations. None of that. You expect professional knowledge of historic facts. None of that. You expect surprising, but understandable changes in the relations or behavior of the characters, none of that. Oh, how shocking : he's Jesus, not the son of God, the foundation of my life shattered, that's the climax? Well no, he's the father of the old professor psychiatrist, who then dies of an heart-attack. Ridiculous. What can you expect from the author of StarTrek series. And for 1.000 of years, it never came to the main character to keep souvenirs of the people he lost, of things he was attached to? Right, superficial all over! There is only one good phrase at the end of the movie : ""It's a beautiful idea, so rich, so full of possibilities."" But the idea of an everliving Caveman is awfully wasted.

806,Goodgollyollie,Thought provoking,6,20 January 2013,"Spoiler alert.The concept of this film is very good. A man living for thousands of years and deciding to reveal himself to close friends who happen to be teachers in various areas who can ask him questions is very intriguing. However most of the questions are very basic and the answers are somewhat vague. The problem is when you intersect real events with the fiction, for example he has a painting that is recognized to be a never before seen Van Gogh. This is fine but when it starts to add that he has also met Buddha and then finally that he was actually Jesus. It was at this point that the film went off the rails and I felt like I was being sold atheist propaganda. That said, the idea of an immortal man who may have been Jesus isn't particularly objectionable to me in itself. It probably would make for another fascinating movie. The problem is, it doesn't fit with this movie because we start off with an interesting concept of a 14,000 year old man and a psychological script that decides halfway through the movie that it wants to now become a statement on all religion being false feels like having a bait and switch done on the viewer. It would have been far better for the writer to have just focused on this man's life through the ages rather than claim he was a specific figure and that figure is a fake. The reason this doesn't entirely work is because the movie is now making a specific claim about a figure in history and making a judgment on that figure that it cannot possibly know to be true.Had he claimed to be someone like George Washington, for example, and cited specific things that happened it would work. But take that figure and have the fictional character say that George Washington was not a real person and a myth was built around him places fiction on top of more fiction. The writer obviously believes that all religion is mythical and seems to use this film as a vehicle to make us question faith in general and uses Christianity as its focus. It could have chosen many other religious characters but focused on the one that would likely be the most offensive in order to shock viewers. In a sense, it could be looked at as an interesting twist in the story because first it questions what you believe. Could you believe a man if he told you he was an individual who lived 14,000 years and could not be proved. And then the twist is that it makes you question your own faith in things you believe. But I personally don't think the intent here was to be thought provoking but more of an atheistic message which is why I feel the movie pulled a bait and switch. I feel like the writer tried to pull a fast one on the viewers.In any event I appreciate most of the film and its concept. I can accept it was low budget and there were a couple of good actors. I even enjoyed seeing William Katt from greatest American hero again. In the end, I think it has merit as thought provoking and an insight on basic psychology and makes you question what you believe but they definitely went off the rails in the main character making the claim he was a specific character from history and then trying to claim he was something other than what we know from writings. It just didn't fit with the rest of the concept. I feel like someone tried to trick me with an atheistic message with a story wrapped around it. Kinda like you feel when you are offered something for free like a timeshare only to find out you have to sit through a long presentation for something you will never buy.",The Man from Earth

That's right, any ""action"" happens hundreds if not thousands of years in the past and the only reason we know about it is because we are told so -- no flashbacks or any of the other traditional methods for moving a story forward are employed.

812,leonardo-allegri,Decent sci-fi but lacking some of the common sense many good reviews invoke,6,10 September 2015,"Considering the fact that this is clearly a low budget movie, I think that the acting and the idea behind the narration are quite good. The movie is enjoyable and can keep your attention up if you became interested in the plot.This leading to a decent overall evaluation of the movie from my point of view. However in my personal experience the interest was mainly directed to the hope that some of the brilliant professors would eventually point out a few, clearly problematic, points in the narration of our ""oldman"". What I'm about to write is mainly thought for those who have seen the movie already, and may be considered a ""spoiler"". Now, if I would encounter a person claiming the same things as the main character of this movie I would say that there are only a few possibilities. We must consider the fact that the man claims to be unable to age and to have any kind of scar, however he is not immortal and he can suffer from wounds, diseases and eventually even die. At a certain point of the movie someone almost point out this fact and conclude that he must have been ""really lucky"". We could even consider that in a lifetime it is possible to avoid deadly diseases or serious accidents, but I'm sure that everyone of us knows at least a few people that, unfortunately, died or got mutilated for one of the reasons given above. If we multiply our lifetime for about two hundred (the lives he is supposed to have gone through) the chances of not experiencing any deadly or mutilating event are really, really, really, low. Even the chance of being hit by a lightning should be taken into consideration at that point. Hence, that ""really lucky"" should turn into an ""almost impossibly lucky"". Another option would of course be the possibility that he is truly blessed by some God that protects him in virtue of some kind of message to give or mission to accomplish. However, since I do not believe in any God, i consider this option as unlikely as the previous one. Even considering this, for him to prove not to be a liar would still be quite easy, although in the movie they seem to consider any demonstration impossible. He could just show them a video, a photo or even a painting of him from the last two hundred years. Obviously there was absolutely no need for me to demonstrate the impossibility of such a case as the one in the movie, I would just have loved some of the professors to raise this questions and make the whole thing more credible.",The Man from Earth

Poorly casting, invalid arguments from historical and geographical point of view, acting was horrible in the case of some characters. In the first 30 min of the movie i was still waiting for that ""something"", that mysterious ""something"" this kind of movies have. Right until the last 20-30 min. of the movie it gave the impression of a under- medium movie. Everything looked very low-budget. Some characters pushed-it too hard, but the drop that filled the glass was when the main character admits to be Jesus, and that he learned everything from Budha.

814,katym-177,Fantastic but floored with a fatal flaw..,7,22 July 2013,A fascinating film centred around philosophical big questions in a single setting much as 'Twelve Good Men' from the archives which lingers in your memory f you're after a thought proving rather than an action movie. The direction keeps the pace moving in spite of this with instant focus on the revelations of David Lee Smith whose character John Oldman is very convincing in his played down approach. This is apparent throughout the movie and if the topic wasn't so compelling it would have been fairly dull to not include 'flashbacks' or other sets apart from the one chilly living room they spend the majority of the film in. The one fatal flaw I found in the arguments skillfully presented was David Lee Smith's character comments on lack of spiritual elements responsible for Life which - scriptwriters please! - is a contradiction in terms to the concept of 'eternity' given his age! Well crafted and recommended watching if you want to stimulate your ideas.,The Man from Earth

And what is really worse is a propaganda film. It's a next step from ""davinci code"" and other documentary of that kind. It's more like a kitchen show, not a movie. And is a kitsch from beginning to end, illogic screenplay, it's like a poor TV movie , insult a minimum of intelligence. If you want one an half hour from a gross manipulation, it's your choice, but this film is a laboratory made movie and my advice is to avoid this film. Why propaganda ?Propaganda because this fantasy have a clear and a subtile dangerous target - to think that movie may be true....",The Man from Earth

I had never heard of this film so I went online to the IMDb site and read some of the reviews.Most of the reviews were positive so I thought I would give this movie a try. I logged into my NetFlix account and started streaming The Man from Earth.The story develops around the following summary: An impromptu goodbye party for Professor John Oldman becomes a mysterious interrogation after the retiring scholar reveals to his colleagues he never ages and has walked the earth for 14,000 years.Right-off-the-bat I notice several things about this film – it was low budget, the characters were poorly cast and the story seem pretty predictable. However, I thought I would allow the movie to play-out so I continued to watch it.About half way through the film the story turned into a ""how to discredit Christianity"" commercial. The writer of the story attempts to use debunked theories to prove Christianity is all a sham. The one alleged Christian character is portrayed as narrow-minded, backward nescient who clings to superstitions no matter how much evidence is thrown at her.The movie is boring, drawn-out and predictable. You can do much better than this.",The Man from Earth

We like true classic like Blade Runner, Star Wars and have had issues with the quality of recent productions. John Billingsley is among my all time favorite actors, and I was looking forward to seeing a new productions with him. The other members of the cast were quite unknown to me, even though I had seen Davis Lee Smith in Mysterious Skin, and Alexis Thorpe in American wedding. This movie has overcome our expectations. It is a true gem, excellent writing, superb acting, and the twist at the end is well... surprising. We had to watch it again to understand some parts. Truly superb movie...",The Man from Earth
818,agoel5920,worth a shot,9,6 January 2014,This is my first review. I was kind of compelled by this movie to write. I cannot claim it the best movie i have seen so far but if at all you are willing to spend 90 min watching movie then believe me you cannot find a better option. This movie is a brilliant piece of thought provoking conversations. It deserves to be in top 250 being such a masterpiece. This is second movie so far i have seen that ends in a room the first being 12 angry men. It is a shame that this movie was not released otherwise it would have made a great hit. Once the conversation between the folks starts i really wished it not to stop. This is such a beautiful movie that i have made many of my friends to watch this who on the other hand prefer Rom-com.,The Man from Earth

820,chrisconnorscrusader,See it to not believe it,1,2 October 2014,"I'm a movie buff,so don't mind suspending my disbelief to live a story but this movie requires along with it,suspension of ur intelligence and ur common sense.I mean u'd have to be incredibly lucky that u not only live for 14000 years but also live in some of the best known moments in history like our very own very oldman john in this movie did by being a sumerian,a babylonian,living under hammurabi,meeting buddha,sailing with columbus,being friends with van gogh and obviously being Jesus himself,LOL.What i find incredible is the lack of any serious thought given in developing the central character,like john obviously realised he was special very early and humans started recording history a long time ago,so why didn't he record his life,in a diary or something.Humans,normals ones,like all of us who know we'll face certain death in 70-80 years,even we always seek a purpose,sometimes higher than our own selves to live by but john here supposedly Jesus himself,lived for almost a 1000 years watching people in europe being burned at the stake by the church for heresy in his name and did absolutely nothing about it,i mean he could have at least tried to form a new religion to undo the damage he unintentionally did the first time around but here he is professor and all,moving on every ten years like a ghost.Initially i thought at least the concept was interesting but the ending was just awful and it morphed into this left wing Christianity bashing,buddhism advertising ugly exercise and i say that even though i'm not a Christian,the poor attempt to hide the lack of story by resorting to Christianity bashing in this movie is just pathetic.",The Man from Earth

Plays out in sort of the way 12 angry men does, in that all of the action is talking and everything seems to take place on one set. Very realistic and dramatic, would definitely recommend.I know it's a little thing, but the part at the end where John called Will ""chilly willy"" really struck a chord with me. Sure parents have nicknames for their children, that's no surprise, but I haven't really seen that sort of thing portrayed in the media. It really gave the moment the spice of realism.I also liked the fact that John's rock knife thing was actually from a thrift store. That was funny.",The Man from Earth
822,myc_spitta,"Would have made a good book, not a movie",4,7 March 2014,"I'm about as atheist as they come, and love a deep philosophical movie, but this was just painful to watch.The content and idea behind it was great. It would have made a great book; in fact, to really play out this idea would have NEEDED a book, not a 90 min movie. But the fact is, this movie just had far too many holes and was wrapped up with some of the worst acting I've ever seen in my life.OK, this was low budget, so I'll put the bad acting thing to the side right from the start. And sure, I understand we are not looking at special effects here; just a bunch of people in 1 room. That's not even an issue for me - one of my favorite genres is ""people trapped in 1 room"" But the story and dialog was just so unbelievable.OK, first; he hung out with BUDDHA, not to mention countless other iconic and powerful figures, either mentioned, or implied for someone who would have lived for 14K years; not to mention unfathomable numbers of ""significant others"" who he must have loved to varying degrees – and never revealed his secret. Yet all it takes is single swig of JW Greens and he's spilling his life story to bunch of mid-tier academics who just happen to inhabit one iota of his thus-far immeasurable lifespan.At first, they predictably call BS on his story. Yet after a few facts spouted out of 6th grade textbooks they are now swaying to the on the side of believing him. There are some interesting philosophical points made about ""how could you tell who is lying?"", but as far as the viewer's story goes, we still haven't been presented with anything that makes us believe.He says he can't remember most of his life. Understandable, who can? But he quickly starts describing walking through tundra, forest, deserts, etc. Obviously he would have retrospectively learnt what these things are, given he had no scale of geography at the time he was there. But without that knowledge as a reference, how would his memory have been able to assign meaning to ""forest"", ""desert"", ""tundra""? I mean, we aren't talking about a Sunday walk here – this is over a period of thousands of year's migration. When does tundra become a forest to someone who has no concept of either, and is passing through them over a period of 2000+ years? He said it himself; only events of extreme importance leave an imprint on the memory.Then the old psychiatrist turns up. He's missed the previous 30mins of story, yet he's able to jump straight in and, in a comrade-like fashion, start asking deeper questions about Oldman's inner beliefs on life and death. No background convincing about the validity of Oldmans's story needed herehe's a believer, right of the bat. But wait, then the psychiatrist inexplicably becomes hostile and threatens ""Either admit this is all a lie, or I'll put you in an asylum"". Well, considering Oldman has kept this thing a secret for 14K years, this presents a real dilemma – either stick to his guns to convince these worthless blips in his life of a tale no-one could ever prove or disprove or just say ""BAAAHAHHHHH, I gotcha!"" Unsurprisingly, he chooses the latter.His friends again have no trouble switching beliefs again – back to disbelief. Phew, what a relief! After a few perfunctory ""WTF dude!"", everyone is matey-matey again, like it never happened.But like I said, the movie had some great philosophical content. Primarily, what indeed would a ""caveman"" be like if given 14K years to live? It's true to an extent, he could never know more than the current progress made at the time. But all that back history, whether he absorbed even only 1% of it, would make him unbelievably knowledgeable. And if he put his mind into active learning, as we assume he did, he would be THE most knowledgeable man of the planet.Therefore, he potentially could be unbelievably rich and powerful. Play the stock market for 200 years? Damn, even just flipping burgers, he would have accumulated immense wealth. ""Oh, but he has to give it all up every 10 years""; OK, even then, anonymous Swiss bank accounts – hell, even burying gold bars in the dirt – have been around long enough in modern history that he would have been the richest man in history without even blinking an eyelid.This movie feels like it was a book. If it wasn't, it should be. If it was, it should have stayed that way.",The Man from Earth

And now, even this movie added to that list. The movie is an outcome of a beautiful and creative mind. It compels you to think beyond your traditional belief about the world and the laws of nature. It will make you believe that even nature laws have their exception. The movie is actually a discussion of group of professors,all experts in their fields about their view points on a rare nature's law exception.

How much can your senses filter the truth? At the end of the day most of our actions are dictated by necessity and if it fits a cause it can be made into an act of God or an act of Evil. Man from Earth does a pretty good job in pointing the obvious stated above. The thing that interests me the most is that at the end of the day one doesn't need to have immortality to gain insights about human culture. It's all here and can be traced down by a free spirit. That's why I was reminded of Agantuk (http://imdb.com/title/tt0101279/). I don't want to talk about the movie because I believe that defeats the purpose of the movie as it intends to initiate a discussion among the viewers about our current beliefs and validity of the norms in society.

Evidently the filmmakers and production company recruited hordes of shills to post bogus reviews in order to salvage an extraordinarily bad film.Proof of point: Most of these phony reviews have similar content and patterns. Some common themes you see in these fake reviews: 1. Making the point that this film doesn't bother with all the overwrought special effects common to big production Hollywood sci-fis. 2. The film is a deep philosophical discussion of ""theology"", ""biology"", ""psychology"". Yes, look for these exact terms and their variants. It's quite amazing all three of these appear simultaneously in so many reviews. 3. Overzealous description of how amazing the film is without explaining specifically why. Generic and broad stroke statements about how ingenious the movie is.I won't bother to describe all the ways this movie is terrible because it's already been done so well by many of the other reviews on here, and I concur.One funny note: The one redeeming quality is accidental.

There's no redeeming quality to this glorified film student project. The characters are caricatures and one-dimensional, the acting is over-emotive and forced, the script is poorly constructed, and above all the plot makes absolutely no sense.Case in point: 1. Why does the main character decide after thousands of years to reveal his secret to this particular group? 2. What's the purpose of revealing his story? He already knows it's implausible and unconsumable.3. Not a shred of evidence? Really? Main character offers up half-assed reasons as to why his story can neither be proved or disproved. Really? You don't have anything to show that's dated at a MINUMUM of 100 years? All you have to do is go back as far as that to at least hook the bait. He conveniently carries nothing through life.

The psychiatrist's wife died just the day before. Nevertheless he rushes over when called on the phone, engages in discussion casually with no hint of being distraught over his recent emotional trauma, pulls a gun at one point (why did he bring a gun?) which happens to be empty (why did he bring an EMPTY gun?), quickly does an about-face with the credibility of the story at the end when he hears his father's name.Don't waste your life with this overwrought misrepresentation of a ""deep philosophical thriller"".",The Man from Earth

It is hands down one of the best Sci-fi films of our generation. It is not your typical eye candy big budget blockbuster illuminated with a star cast. You may not recognize anyone from the cast. The fact that almost all the movie is shot around a single room may not be appealing at first. But 10 minutes into the movie, and all these objections disappear into insignificance as the main story unfolds and draws you into it like a black hole.The movie begins with Professor John Oldman who is about to shift to a new location after 10 yrs. What starts as a simple interrogation from his colleagues on to why he is moving, unfolds into an a brilliant, intense and engrossing discussion as John reluctantly decides to disclose his inconceivable secret in the form of an intellectual game. As his colleagues, professors from various departments use their expertise in their respective fields to counter or support his claims, he gradually ascends from hypothetical assumptions and begins answering the questions in a first person perspective. His calm,impromptu and logically on spot answers to everything baffles his friends as they find the foundation of their beliefs and assumptions rocked. The gripping conversation that follows is simply aesthetic to the brain, as we realize how meaningless are our assumptions and beliefs about life which we haven't even seen and if we can be really sure about something. The script never loses its focus for a moment and the portrayal of the characters by the actors is so genuine that you almost feel as if you are there in the cabin with the characters. The movie projects you onto a philosophical and imaginative backdrop. It is a brilliant story, which is made better by the setting. It is like reading a really good book, your imagination takes over to fill the gaps and you are left pondering over the meaning of life, the authenticity of your beliefs, and if what we assume to be real is in fact real. The movie really makes the most out of its microscopic budget of 0.2 million dollars, and the fact that Jerome Brixby wrote the screenplay for around 35 years shows how much effort has been put into the story. For all of you out there, who appreciate a little cerebral activity once in a while, this is a must. We have become so addicted to the striking visuals and the exploits of the advanced photography and computers, that a certain very important section of cinema has almost disappeared into a dark corner.

This makes way for an interesting conversation between them revealing aspects of John's life that are too hard to believe. The movie ends with a small twist which keeps you thinking for quite a while.The 89 minute long movie takes place only around one house. It is heavy on dialogue but it is precise and well written. Though there is not much scope for acting, all the actors have done justice to their roles. But the real hero of this movie is the writer Jerome Bixby. He has done an excellent job in materializing his ideas. It may hurt the religious sentiments of some sections but that is completely dependent on the viewer. All in all, ""The Man from Earth"" is a must watch for all thinkers out there. Watch it with an open mind and you will never regret.",The Man from Earth

I never really came to, until last night.I recommend you before you watch this incredible movie: do not read the instructions or the short summary on the back of the DVD. I also recommend you, to watch this movie at night, before you go to sleep, it just helps you think about what just happened. Not like other movies, this movie does not care about special effects, fancy locations or other things. It's just about the story, as it should be in every movie. Sadly it's not always the case, but that's another story.",The Man from Earth

They request John to tell the reason for taking this unexpected decision. John shares his reason for moving out by revealing his past, which results in an interesting debate between these intellects. This small film challenges mainstream belief and provokes deep thought and is not recommended for those who don't want their beliefs to be challenged. The complete movie happens in a single house and there are no mind blowing visual effects nor action is involved. The acting of the cast is good but the complete credit goes for the idea behind this movie. The background music is good and perfectly matches the scenes. I would recommend this movie to anyone who is open to new ideas or ways to look at the world.",The Man from Earth

All the good reviews on IMDb and on Amazon are reviews by friends, family and people the film makers have paid off so that idiots like me will see the 8/10 rating and buy it! It's worse than anything I did at college - the acting, dialogue, storyline, set, absolutely everything is beyond laughable. It looks and feels like an amateur ""straight to TV"" movie. I didn't even get to the end of the film because I didn't want to waste any more of my time! If you don't believe me then stop and check out the cast, they're all nobodies who have never and will never do anything good in Hollywood ever! Something needs to be done to stop these fake reviews, having looked into it this is not the only film it's happened with and it's making a mockery of the review system on sites like this. Do yourself a favour and DO NOT BUY THIS! Why didn't they spend the extra budget on making the film rather than paying people to do reviews?!?!? Still don't believe me?

I was expecting an alien like movie or such because of the title and cover, i did not even read any review or seen the trailer, just plain random renting and i am glad i pick this one.The Setting was slow, and stale dialog at the beginning, but the strange thing is it never felt boring, and its getting better and better by the minute. The dialog was very engaging, although the acting could have been better.I wont spill the beans with spoilers or anything, but i will tell you that the idea of the film is brilliant, great script, good (enough) cast, and great impact on how i feel about the world when the film ends, and that's a very strong point.Controversy aside i recommend this to everyone, Score: 9 out of 10",The Man from Earth

The background score and acting is excellent. It is definitely one of the best movies I have watched. A gem. It remains close to your heart and makes you question everything. One of the rare movies which makes you think every second while you are watching it. Anybody who likes to exercise their brains s should watch it.

Pshychology, and any other themes you can imagine. And this movie pressed more of my buttons in more different fields than any movie I have ever seen, without even thinking to myself ""duuuh! That's wrong!"" even a single time. And they even manage to keep the conversations interesting and intriguing all along the way.If you have not seen this movie, but are reading these reviews to determine if you should put it on or not, I simply got this to say: ""Press play.

852,diggerthedirtyhorse,Amazing film. Really got me thinking.,10,8 January 2008,"OK, so this is my first film review/comment so I don't have much experience in the reviewing department, however I do have experience in watching films! (Doesn't everybody? haha) To be honest, when I first heard of this movie my expectations weren't that high. I simply thought 'Oh, another independent film. Probably low budget, meaning a lame script, screen play and surely the selection of cast can't be that fantastic', however when I sat down to watch this movie, I was pleasantly surprised.Not only did it really get me thinking about life and what it means, but in a way it gave me a different perspective on history, and what people 'could have' been like in that time (I know this film is not a history text book, but as a visual person it gave me an insight into the possibility of what life was like back then).This movie practically had me sitting at the edge of my seat, just waiting for the next line of dialogue that would meet my ears. To me, it almost felt like I was sitting there on the chair with that group, becoming transfixed with John Oldman's story.I rate this movie a 10 out of 10, simply because not many movies get me thinking like this one did - And it also has a level of educational value in there that I found rather interesting (being a history student and all). To anyone that finds Earth's history curious, intriguing and interesting, I recommend this movie to you.Sci-Fi fans will love this! As did I! And Dear Director, thankyou for making this movie. You have made me a very happy person.",The Man from Earth

I was trying to identify the middle ground between Reason and Faith. The movie pokes into that. Wonderfully written, the words make you think. The plot grips you. It's amazing to see how intense dialogs can override the need for outdoor shots, fancy locations and other production hassles. The Man from Earth does not preach a particular idea. It does not influence any ideas upon you. It just puts forth a question. How do you find that middle ground? Brilliant acting, epic dialogs and the constant probe into personal belief makes the movie a must watch!",The Man from Earth

Its a story makes you wandering, makes you eager to hear more and at some point you feel the thrill where this story takes you, breaks all you have known and show you a new reality, that could be true. It shows how a good script is well enough to hold the audience glued to the screen. Please, make a time and watch this movie.",The Man from Earth
855,mtschladetzky,"Better than the negative reviews, maybe not so good as the positive.",8,10 June 2015,"This movie was a wonderful trip down the rabbit hole labeled ""eternal youth"". I let this movie take me on a wandering journey through ""what-ifs"" and ""I wonders"" and was thoroughly pleased with the experience. I fully acknowledge that there are historical inaccuracies, but for most of us 'common folk' the 'facts' given are what we know and are what we were taught. This movie is good because of the idea explored, and the portrayal of the people's reactions to it. I don't think this is a movie about a 14.000 year old man. This is a movie about people's reactions to an absolutely unbelievable concept. This isn't a man on the street coming up to you and claiming that he is a 14.000 year old caveman. This is your best friend that you went k- 12 with suddenly saying that. His credibility lies in the fact that these people have known him for 10 years. They sit and talk to him and believe him because they have every reason to believe that he is serious. I know that if I was trying get a friend to explain why he was leaving and he finally, and reluctantly, told me this tale in perfect seriousness, I would at least listen to the whole thing. I don't find their reactions at all unbelievable.One of the two big story complaints I have seen is the name dropping of historical figures like Hammurabi, Buddha, van Gogh, and other famous figures. Yes, it is absolutely absurd that one man would happen to run into these figures (though I want to point out that he only said that he lived under Hammurabi, not that he knew him) but ask yourself this, would it be interesting if he didn't? If his entire history was, I spent some time in Switzerland with Zarko the dairy farmer, studied with Chi Ling the rice cooker, and was happily fishing in Japan around the time of Jesus, would that be nearly as interesting? Maybe it could be quite interesting in a full on book to explain his watching of the rise and fall of empires from the view of other nations, but I don't see it making a good movie.Since I just mentioned Jesus, let's talk about the other big complaint. There is definitely and atheistic slant to this film. I'm not going to deny that. Some find this to be quite offensive, but it isn't really saying that this is absolutely the truth of Jesus, not as I'm viewing it anyway. This was a purely hypothetical, ""What if a man survived through all of human history? What if in his lifetime he tried to teach all of the philosophy he learned?"" If the dominant faith in the U.S. was Islam, he would have been Mohammad. This didn't say to me, ""This is what happened"" but ""This could have happened, in some fashion.""Finally, I want to add my two cents about the character John. I very much identify with this character in his gentle nature, and somewhat passive behaviour. This man is a born scholar and in his own words, ""not adventurous."" This isn't the man who romped through history, rocking it with Alexander the Great and Attila the Hun. This is a guy who would have been attracted to colleges, schools, and other low confrontation areas. I honestly would have had trouble with him being 14.000 years old if he were anybody but a passive introvert. Were he braver, bolder, or even just more emotional, I would be sure that he would have gotten someone seriously riled up and gotten shot or stabbed somewhere even he couldn't heal. The only time he did put himself out there, he very narrowly avoided death because he had learned some nifty (and narratively convenient) tricks.In summary, I would say that this is an unconventional, but good movie with an intriguing idea and a gripping narrative. It is slow, it is a bit far-fetched, and definitely a bit cornball, but it is worth your time if you can just let go and flow with it. It is especially fun if you are the type to bullshit philosophy with your mates every chance you get. 8/10",The Man from Earth

857,crf-09153,Astounding... and my first review,10,13 November 2019,"I have been using for the better part of 10 years and have never felt so compelled to leave a review in my life. This has been my favorite movie of all time since it came out, and for good reason. The thoughtfulness of this movie cannot be overstated. Is it the smartest film of all time? Of course not. But if you have an open mind it will keep you on edge and thinking about the world for weeks on end, which is more than most films ask. This is a film for people who like to think, nothing fancy in the mix. The bad reviews are what spurred me to make this review in the first place. The film does not intend to replace religion or even debate it, rather to open the mind to all possibilities and open discussion and the mind to the idea of alternatives and relative history. Does he claim to be Jesus? Kind of yes and no. When i first watched this movie, halfway through i thought it was a load of crock, until i started to think. The idea of a man preaching of togetherness, love, and brotherhood brought to the western culture would have been quickly deified and cemented as an unwilling martyr as our character claims to be. Could it be true? Probably not. Does it make you thing of possible alternate routes our religion and reality might have taken? This is the point of the movie. Not to force politics, but to make you think about how you believe. This movie is thought provoking, incredibly well made,",The Man from Earth
858,neiljohnjackson,An honest review,1,16 October 2016,"Not sure what is going on with this title on IMDb. I am not the only person who has decided to submit a review purely based on the fact that the rating of this title is biased. I am not sure how this is achieved?, but trust me - this title cannot ever be rated as 8.0. I watch films not based on IMDb rating but based on what I feel like on the menu. A bit like how I eat. Sometimes I want something fancy, sometimes a nice sandwich is perfect and the odd time I just want a glass of water. Basically what I am saying is that I am open to anything. However I do object when I decide to order a nice salad and I get served rotten leaves from the rubbish bin. Please take this as an honest review when I say that this film is no where near a rating of 8.0 and I have rated it 1.0 in an attempt to somehow balance out the universe that is IMDb. I can only hope another 100,000 honest reviewers do the same. Of course you may be tempted to give it a go like I did and regret it afterwards. If you do - please join the campaign and leave an honest rating and review to warn others. Thanks.",The Man from Earth

It's very easy to tell what kind of people are writing these reviews....Some are people that can only be entertained by watching a film with big explosions,or car chases or shootouts,or boobs and fart jokes,or beautiful people and shiny things. Then,there are the deeply religious that are offended if your God is different than theirs(or you don't worship anything)-HERETICS! THEN there are those that can watch a movie and can judge if its an entertaining film regardless of a low budget or questionable lighting or editing or music or the occasional out of focus shots, and USE INTELLECT to tell others what the movie made them feel.This movie made me THINK - a rarity for a movie these days!I've watched Man from Earth with many friends and twice-TWICE-seen friends stand up and shout at the t.v.- in an embarrassing,bad way! I swear! That alone should tell you Man from Earth is different...I know that I didn't give you a good review of this movie,but what I am giving you is this advice - watch with an open mind and if you find yourself shaking your fist at the television and screaming at it,leave immediately,go to your place of worship,and beg your God to brainwash you some more till the awful thoughts in your head are all gone.",The Man from Earth

And do not write my opinion off as wanting a certain thing from a film, like big budgets or action sequences or sex or anything else. I watched this film because it was on the 'People who liked' for 'Coherence', which was amazing, despite being low budget and lo-fi. Man From Earth, on the other hand, is just bad writing that is then acted badly and filmed on some kind of rig from the '70s. Seriously, natural light etc. is great, but not if you actually can't see anything and the whole thing just looks like a straight to video production. So what do people see in this? you may ask. Well, I don't want to give spoilers, so I won't, but it basically promotes a really popular (but wrong) world view about some pieces of history, that, I shall reiterate, are totally wrong and not believed by any historians anywhere.

Don't waste your time.The whole film (or at least what I was able to stand watching) takes place in a living room, focusing on a conversation between professors. Films like this can be great (cf. 12 Angry Men), but they absolutely need solid writing and acting. Unfortunately, it seems this movie was written by the angstiest of the internet atheism crowd, and while no actors could make a script this bad shine, these actors do especially poorly.I was told to go into this film being willing to have my beliefs challenged, and I understand why I was told that.

What makes it different is that one of the professors is actually a 14,000 year old man. John played by David Lee Smith, reveals this long-held secret to the group of curious professors. The way John pacifies their baffled minds, with answers so unexpected. Studded with logical explanations the movie is a must watch for those with a taste for deeper understanding.Unlike other movies from the science fiction genre, this movie has its base rooted deeply in ideas. One shouldn't expect a lot on the acting part for its only the story that counts for this one.

I assumed that one of the friends faked a heart attack so he could escape this pointless conversation. One of the characters said something about a shooting. Perhaps he shot himself to escape?

I find this to be so lovely though because it really makes the audience appreciate all of the work put into it even better. This is one of those movies that the script had to be absolutely flawless for in the writing room, and the director somehow managed to make it shine even more visually when bringing it to picture. One must have a high attention span while watching this, but it's not a challenge to do so after you're already 10 minutes in.

877,kazbrekkerdev,The coziest movies I've ever seen. ^^,9,10 January 2017,"I should start saying that I never write reviews, to be honest I never have written a review until now. So, you must be wondering ""why are you writing this review for that particular movie?"", my answer is simple. The Man from Earth isn't the best movie I ever seen,though is the kind of movie that really makes you think. The most powerful weapon present in this movies is its storytelling, which flows in such a way that one can't avert their gaze. I don't know about you, but this movie made me curious about a lot of things, things which I'm definitely going to check out, and that is the best thing I could get from a work of fiction.",The Man from Earth
878,nsonno,Good thinking but not outstanding!,3,21 January 2008,"First of all we make clarify what is ten point movie? If the answer e.g ""Blade Runner"", then this movie deserves just 2 or 3 points. Why? 'cos this looks like a documentary rather than a movie. Yeah, let's say I'm atheist and I've searched lots of religions (just two of them), science and mythology from a certain point of view and I developed a theory, oops I inspired then I wrote it... Let's accept that in terms of cinematography, acting, dramatic structure this movie is not worth to discuss about it. Please don't get me wrong, I am not against the idea of very low budget kinda technique... In fact I love it e.g Linklater's Tape. That's a brilliant work not this one. For that reason ""the man from earth"" has one thing to talk about that is the ""caveman"" theory. Yeah it's a interesting theory but not new! The idea and the twist (Jesus Christ!) weren't surprising for me 'cos I'm kinda used to it. In my country we have a specialist academician (M. Ilmiye Cıg) about how ancient cultures did invent and influence religions and lots of things related (and I'm sure every country has...). For that reason for me, this movie's topic is so familiar 'cos I've eye-witnessed to this sort of topic in a discussion at many times. Cinema is an art and art requires creativity. This is just a reporting documentary. By the way, at the finale if john wouldn't decipher himself as Jesus, dramatic structure'd be better but again not brilliant.",The Man from Earth

880,hthite,Thought-provoking; highly recommended!,8,9 January 2010,"The Man from Earth is a thought provoking movie. It is different from your everyday dramas and thrillers, since there's not much action - it all happens in the conversation.The premise of the movie is in a man living for 14000 years, his mental makeup, references, memory juxtaposed over a group of otherwise ordinary ""professors"", all experts in their own domains. He tries to bid adieu to them, in his true form, but they refuse to believe him, thinking he's taking a tale too far. He accepts this, only to get to the marvelous ending: The psychology professor is his own son; worse, our ""caveman"" has to see him die, as the professor is unable to bear the emotional pain! Despite this, the female lead decides to follow him on, brings out that perspective in human nature - I'll take my satisfaction now, and suffer the consequences later. Brilliantly done!The movie is otherwise minimalistic, and that probably is it's charm. It will be releasing on BlueRay on 2nd February, 2010. Highly recommended!",The Man from Earth

But ""Primer"" is a much better example of that. Because ""The Man From Earth"" is all premise and no film.It's a fantastic, thought-provoking idea. No argument there. But they didn't build anything resembling a film around it. Yes, you can make a great film out of pure conversation, but you have to be careful to construct real, convincing, engaging drama. This film does not. The dialog varies from acceptable to outrageously phony (a good example: one character howling out in a heated moment ""I reject this!"" Who talks like that?) The character's reactions are inconsistent and swing wildly from confusing to unbelievable. Every twist is predictable. The final revelation is poorly set up as a crazy coincidence, overheard by accident.If the film gets by, it's only because the premise is so fascinating.

The author of this video is untalented as he is ideologically motivated, like all leftists today are. Notice how the only negative things said in the whole movie were about the church and Christianity. So, out of 14 000 years of human civilization, only church was negative?

Sure I enjoy the occasional action movie and a comedy, but when a film like this comes along, you feel that there is some creativity left in the cinema world.After watching this film I realised that it jut takes a room full of scholars and some powerful dialog is all that takes to keep a person hooked to the screen such that I couldn't even pause the movie to keep my dinner plate back in the sink.The only thing that sucks is that after the movie has ended, you have to face reality.

There are blockbusters which are absolutely worthless, and there are ""cheap"" movies, made with such a tiny budget you could have shot them as a highschool project. Well, The Man from Earth is one of the latter.The lack of budget is visible, through the whole movie. One house, people chatting inside, that's about it. So, what's so great about this ? What is great is, by merely chatting, the characters manage to hook you, the viewer, into wanting to hear more. Into wanting to know more. That sure worked for me.So, yeah, the plot could be summarized as ""they talk, and discuss whether they should believe him, or not"". But the genius of it, even though the scenario is quite simple, even though the means are ridiculously cheap, is to have made it WORK. I started viewing, and thought the guy's claim was interesting. And then, I watched the whole movie to know whether that claim was true, or not. No stunts, no special effects, nothing, just people talking.

899,farfolomew,Solid 6/10 movie (in a good way!),6,20 January 2016,"A fun movie to watch, and keeps you interested because of its unique story. It's a very simple movie with one setting. It feels very much like a play. If you like philosophical discussions, this one's for you! Read further for my analysis of its score (which, for this movie, I think is quite good!)I gave it a solid 6/10, after initially giving it a 7. It's probably closer to a 7, as in my book a 7 is a ""good movie"" and a 6 is ""average"". Usually my 6s are reserved for big-budget Hollywood movies that I didn't particularly like but at the same time I can't rate lower because of production value, effects, editing, acting, etc. If you have to rate every movie ever made on the same scale of 1-10 very few should be 10s and even less 1s--mostly because you'd have to seek out the worst of the worst to find a 1. As far as this movie goes, it's production value, directing, editing, etc are all clearly B-movie quality. The acting is actually pretty good, and the actors are all capable. It's the directing and the script that makes the actors seem poor at times. The story is absolutely a great and unique one, which is ultimately what elevated this movie from a 4 or 5. But then again, the big plot holes prevent it from reaching that 7/10 mark indicating I thought it was solidly a good movie. It's tough, because I can't say it was bad either. This movie's a good example of having great elements and bad elements, combining to give it an average score!",The Man from Earth

904,simonshareef,A movie to make one think,10,16 October 2009,"It is seldom that movie is able to intrigue me in such a way as to wish it all to be true. The Man from Earth had me glued, unblinking, to the end. And at the end I was thoroughly satisfied, almost gleefully happy and childishly excited.Here is a movie that asks a rather interesting question, one that would keep your imagination going wild and hungry and your coffee table discussions going long into the night. The Man from Earth asks the question, ""What if a man from upper-paleolithic survived until the present day?""And thus with that question I was taken in on a roller-coaster ride of fantastical imaginative proportions as 14,000 years of Earth's history, with rolling landscapes, thousands of languages, millions and millions of people being born and dying, great swathes of time creating and erasing cultures and the arrival of magic and supernatural and religions, were compressed into my mind in just 1 and half hours.But there are no super CG effects. No flashbacks or illustrations. Not even sketches. In fact, there was nothing but storytelling and dialog and that was all I (and the characters in the movie itself) had going, or indeed, had needed. The Man from Earth's story reminded me of some of the tales from the Sandman series of graphic novels by Neil Gaiman. A man living 14,000 years can meet many interesting people. Or even deliberately choose to meet them knowing that he shall outlive them and survive to tell the story.The premise for the plot of the movie took me almost by surprise. How could it be so simple and yet so profound - simple, yet astoundingly intriguing at a deeply intellectual level. Perhaps it is because, given our limited lifespan, we yearn to live the millenniums to see what the passage of time would reveal. It would indeed be something to meet a 14,000 year old living man. That's for sure.It would definitely make it easy to predict our behaviour as a species. Would the current religions die away a thousand years from now as did other belief systems before? Would there be another ice-age? Or even a nuclear holocaust that would send humanity to the brink of extinction? Will we leave our planet and start a migratory journey into space?To bear witness to the millenniums must be like being God.I highly recommend this one.",The Man from Earth

However a good film goes the distance, it thinks outside the box and it shows you an idea... A concept regardless of the cost (be it financial or visual).'The man from Earth' didn't have Explosions, it didn't have aliens coming down raining fire, it didn't have cities collapsing and it certainly didn't have a massive budget. But it was A fantastic movie. I cannot stress enough how good the film was. I myself have watched the film countless times and not once does my interest weaver.It is one of those films that will leave you thinking for a good long time and it will DEFINITELY leave you satisfied (if not mind-blown).In my honest opinion, ""The man from Earth"" is a Perfect example that even a film with a low budget and no fancy explosions can surpass even the biggest blockbusters around... My only fear is that films like this do not get enough credit, and that in future they will not be made...The world needs more films like this.",The Man from Earth
906,rickbeavers,Interesing Premise Took Wrong Turn,3,22 April 2018,"Intrigued by the premise, I stuck with it until the end, though my opinion of it went way downhill when the character claimed to be a well-known historical figure (spoiler alert: read no further if you don't want to know who).The writer's ignorance of archeology, history, close-knit cultures (specifically, Jewish culture) and the Bible are displayed by the university professors' inability to successfully challenge the claim.I am not a university professor or a Biblical scholar, but I could have poked his claim to have been Jesus of Nazareth full of holes. For example, how did this Gentile insert himself into an orthodox Jewish community and family? No way! How did he become an expert in Jewish Torah to the extent he could silence the Pharisees and Saducees of the day, who dedicated their lives to studying Torah? It would have required a Jewish Rabbi to teach him, and he would have had to be an exceptional student, all secretly, of course, or he would never have been accepted as the expected Messiah, since that would require tracing his lineage through King David. So he would have had to become that expert as a Gentile (not something Jewish Rabbis did), then disaapeared and reappeared as a Jew. Not just any Jew, but a verifiable descendant of King David. Jewish people were extremely careful about tracing lineage, since ancient times, so, again, no way!And what happened to the baby born in Bethlehem? The child grew up and traveled to Jerusalem with Mary, Joseph,their other children, and extended family annually. He taught in the Temple at age 13. How did this guy pull that off? No way!Did he step in and replace the real Jesus at some later date? No way! The family of Jesus would have known the deception immediately. When questioned about incidents in the Gospels, he basically says they are wrong. The professors jump on that and help him out by saying the Bible has been changed over the years. Archeological finds (Dead Sea scrolls) confirm that modern translations of the Bible are almost identical to ancient manuscripts of 2000 years ago. So, these learned professors just decide his story is more believable than the multiple eyewitness accounts recorded in the New Testament. Even the ""Christian literalist"" reluctantly buys in. She obviously isn't a born-again, spirit-filled Christian, or she would know Christians have an on-going relationship with their living God, Jesus Christ. So she is duped.Soooo many ways to shoot his story down, but the writer sets up a weak straw man argument, and then tears it down, losing anyone who knows anything about the real Jesus Christ.Never mind the serious contrast between the character and teachings of Jesus and this guy who seems to regularly father children then abandon wife & child after 10 years to start over. What an immoral, selfish, irresponsible, low-life! Sadly, this interesting premise took a wrong turn to push a lame, humanistic philosophy, making university professors look like idiots in the process.",The Man from Earth

John Billingsley (Harry) had come to a Star Trek convention, and he brought a clip. The whole idea was that it was intended to be filmed as a low budget movie.

The acting and editing is soap opera worthy and very cringe inducing at times. The dialogue is just as bland and uninteresting as everything else in this movie.

Are these seriously what we are calling new and shocking ideas? To how many of you did it not previously occur, perhaps during your adolescence, to think, ""Well, what if Jesus's teachings were distorted? What if he is looking at the world today upset at its mistakes? What if Jesus was just Some Guy?"" Could this idea not have been approached with some intellectual integrity? Especially in the nonsense academic setting in which the story is placed, perhaps some academic research and thought would have been appropriate. The story, written as it is, might have been better placed around a table at which were seated a religious zealot, jokester, and pseudo-philosopher who didn't happen to have degrees.Acting is terrible too. Everything altogether feels like a high school play. Tony Todd's weird mumbling, high-school pseudo-philosophy ramblings sound like he is about to lose in a poetry slam, Harry's awkward joke-telling is consistently unnatural, and John himself is odious and wooden, creaking through his stiff dialogue.I watched this movie based on IMDb's ratings, which have at times failed me, but never before have I found popular opinion on this site to be so bizarre. I can't remember ever having said this before, but I honestly think that this movie had few, perhaps even no redeeming features!
