0,nogodnomasters,You're stronger than the others,6,5 November 2019,Eli (Charlie Shotwell) is another Bubble Boy allergic to everything. Dr. Horn (Lili Taylor) claims to have a cure which she administers from her large sealed home. Things are not going well for Eli who claims he sees ghosts of former patients. Dr. Horn claims it is just a side effect of the medicine.This is not the Bubble Boy story I was expecting. It lacked the subtle opening clues for what was to come. Decent acting.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity,Eli
1,kosmasp,Say my name,7,21 February 2020,"Actually don't and the music reference does not say anything about the movie either. Though I'm pretty sure they didn't just roll the dice on that one, but had some thoughts on it (biblical and all that). The name aside this movie is quite nicely structured and if you don't mind jump scares, you will have quite an entertaining ride.There are certain twists that I did not see coming and others that I think were quite obvious. Whatever the case may be (or rings true for you), the movie will work for people who do like horror movies in general - do not let the flaws take the fun away from you. Good actors too btw",Eli
2,Sleepin_Dragon,"Very watchable, just don't expect scares.",6,21 November 2019,"It's not exactly a horror as such, I would class Eli perhaps more in the psychological thriller genre, with some horror undertones. In the beginning it's full of suspense, and does offer up somemo e ts of horror, towards the end it changes up, and takes you to a place you won't be expecting to end up. It's somewhat unusual, but it's not without its merits.Points for originality, effects and acting, on the debit side, the twist may be a bit too extreme for some, plus it was billed as a horror, and didn't really offer many scares.Young Charlie Shotwell is the standout, and he's in some great company, mainly Kelly Reilly, although the young actor steals it.Definitely better then some of the reviews would have you believe. 6/10",Eli
3,michaelRokeefe,Things are just not what they seem,6,19 September 2020,"A young boy named Eli (Charlie Shotwell) undergoes a last-ditch effort to be cured of a very rare autoimmune disorder. The house in which he lives is no safer than the institute he enters to seek normalcy. Be ready of a few horror movie scare jumps in spite of not being an actual scary movie. Some graphic scenes with blood, gore and depictions of demonic imagery. Fear is more atmospheric than visual.Cast also features: Lili Taylor, Kelly Reilly, Max Martini and Sadie Slink.",Eli
4,trashgang,all elements are there,6,23 October 2020,"When a boy can't breath in open space he has to go to a special house for a cure. But the cure doesn't look what it should be.More I can't say, otherwise I'm spoiling. Excellent performance by the boy (Charlie Shotwell) and smart to add Sadie Sink from Stranger Things to this flick. It's not scary at all but it do has some jumpscene's. Further the effects are above mediocre and the ending has a twist you can't see coming.Filed under horror but even as all elements are there it's also low on horror. It wasn't that bad but not for the lovers of the genre.
Gore 0,5/5
Nudity 0/5
Effects 2,5/5
Story 2/5
Comedy 0/5",Eli
5,deloudelouvain,Better than I thought it would be after reading negative reviews.,7,17 November 2019,"Horror movies are the easiest movies to review, most of the time you either like it or you don't. It's a genre where almost everything possible has been done before so to come up with an original story isn't the easiest thing to do. Eli is innovative I thought, it's entertaining from beginning till the end, and that mostly due to the constant mystery that hovers over the movie. There is a good portion of suspense, the cast is good, all actors did a good job creating that special dark ambiance. There are some nice twists so it's not that you will figure out the whole story immediately. As for the horror it might be mild for the hardcore horror fans but still it is entertaining. My wife is easily scared and so was she with Eli.",Eli
6,sddavis63,Given The Ending It's Kind Of Embarrassing That I Enjoyed This For So Long,3,25 October 2019,"The most truly embarrassing thing about watching ""Eli"" is that I actually enjoyed it for about three quarters of its runtime. It held my attention. It was a decent horror/thriller kind of movie with a strange doctor and supernatural twist that seemed to be building to something pretty interesting. Rose and Paul are the parents of Eli. Eli has some type of strange disease that prevents him from going into the outside world unless he's wearing a suit to shield every inch of his body from the environment. They take him to Dr. Horn, who has developed some sort of a treatment for Eli's condition. But Dr. Horn doesn't seem to be exactly what she portrays herself as. Horn and the house in which she provides her ""treatments"" become the centre of the mystery, as Eli starts seeing strange, ghostly figures (real or hallucinations?) and the treatments seem to make him worse rather than better.It was all adding up to a good and interesting thriller with some decent enough shocks thrown in - and then came the last quarter of the movie or so, when this simply took on completely unexpected (not to mention silly, ridiculous, and foolish) religious angle that turned it into little more than yet another ho-hum ""spawn of Satan"" movie. I suppose in some ways it deserves credit for not telegraphing that right from the start, but I just felt kind of let down when the story took such a weird and unexpected turn.I'd have to say that the performances also were a bit of a letdown. Not horrible, but no one's performance really stood out to me either, and I'd have to say that aside from Lili Taylor (who played Dr. Horn) I really didn't recognize any of the lead actors in this. All in all, this turned out to be a big disappointment. (3/10)",Eli
7,thesar-2,The Movie of Eli,8,7 October 2020,"Who knows the story of the Real Bubble Boy?It must Burn this Bright kid to never leave his bubble. Poor, young Eli. Allergic to well, everything, he spends his days in isolation and have seen numerous doctors. But, he might have met his cure with Dr. Lili Taylor! Or...has he?This is a very well-made movie with a fairly well-written and evolving script - one of my favorite kinds. It got a bit choppy close to the finale with revelations, but never lost me. Not to mention, I love these kinds of endings. Perfect for these kinds of super creepy body-horror thrillers.***Final thoughts: Proud to say I did guess one of the several twists, but super happy I did NOT catch the main one. Very nice. And don't worry about catching anything. Well, anything that won't put you in your own Bubble.",Eli
8,Edvis-1997,5,5,17 April 2020,I saw it like 2-3 months ago it wasn't scary or horror lol. The action was very slow it was pretty boring only in last 5-10minutes something happened. Wouldn't recommend to watch it for horror movies fans.,Eli
9,ops-52535,surprised,9,18 October 2019,"Its no wonder really, its halloween coming up soon, and why dont let yourself into this devilish mindgame, i did and got some nica jolt s in return. its really a spectacular film about supernaturality and a claustrophobic , superstitious nighmareish stay at the private nundriven catholic hospital.the childacting in this film are just marvelous, and should be seen because of that. the grumpy old man awards it with a 9. well done",Eli
10,cruise01,Lacking the scares with its slow direction but has a intense third act.,6,24 October 2019,"3 out of 5 stars.Eli is a horror film that is slow building with a concept about an auto immune disorder which the boy has to stay inside a house that is sanitized and hoping the doctors there can cure him. While there is something supernatural lurking in the mansion. The horror movie is slow and boring throughout but there is a twist that you will not see coming which leaves for a brutal third act.The plot follows Eli (Charlie Shotwell) who was diagnosed with an auto immune disorder which he gets a bad reaction to everything. He spends years living in a sanitized plastic covered room. When he travels he is in a hazmat suit cause the outside will cause him to react. His parents Rose (Kelly Reilly) and Paul (Max Martini) are taking him to a specialists who does treatments in a isolated estate. The specialist Dr. Horn (Lili Taylor) will try three treatments to Eli, hoping it can cure him from the disorder. As they stay in the estate, there is something lurking in the mansion which Eli is not sure if it is in his mind or there is something more going on behind Dr. Horn.The plot is dull and slow moving with its direction. The second act was slow and boring. Eli lurking around the corridors and seeing something supernatural. The film tries for some cheap scares with something popping out which was predictable. Eli meets a strange girl outside the house which they communicate through the backdoor window who is Haley (Sadie Sink). Which she says there is something wrong with the doctors there.The film is not really scary or horrifying at all. Which was kind of a disappointment. The cast were decent with their roles. The twist is something that you will not see coming. It was definitely a wtf moment when the third act comes around. Without giving away any spoilers. The third act connects what the plot really is about and the direction story changes into a different turn of events. Can not name other movies similar without giving away a major plot point. It answers the parents secret. The doctors motives. And Eli's discovery about the supernatural in the house. The third act does get a little brutal and violent. Which may leave you rolling your eyes or shocked and creeped out.Overall, Eli is a fair horror film. It may lack the scares. It is kind of boring throughout the movie with its dull plot. The performances are decent. The third act does save the movie with its shocking twist in direction.",Eli
11,Fella_shibby,Eli managed to hold my attention n the revelation is truly sinister but it can be compared with other films n if I take the names then it may b spoiling the twist.,5,21 October 2019,"Ciarán Foy's first film Citadel is spooky n downright surrealistic, his second film Sinister 2 was a bit letdown.
His third film Eli managed to hold my attention n the revelation is truly sinister but it can be compared with other films n if I take the names then it may b spoiling the twist.The other reason which made me bear this film is Kelly Reilly, an attractive babe, especially her smokey eyes.This film doesnt have any gore or demonic possessions n the kills r only in the end.
It has same old jump scares, via mirror, curtains n corridors.But it does have some questionable stuff:
A young kid is able to unlock a drawer without keys with just two pins.
A shower is on n a family is having a reunion while the water from the shower keeps flowing n by the way that water is more purer than bottled water.Some stuff is unbearable regarding kids:
A child undergoing treatment, specially with a bone punch, needles n syringes, etc. is a bit upsetting.
Drilling a kid's skull ain't good man.",Eli
12,gwnightscream,"Different, But Not Bad",5,23 October 2019,"This 2019 horror film features a young boy, Eli (Charlie Shotwell) who is taken to a mansion by his parents where a doctor performs treatment for his rare condition. Soon, Eli starts to suspect something when his body reacts strangely to the medications and he starts seeing ghosts. This is different, but not bad. It shares similar aspects of ""The Boy in the Plastic Bubble,"" ""Rosemary's Baby,"" ""13 Ghosts"" & ""Brightburn."" There's some suspenseful, dramatic and eerie moments and Lili Taylor (The Haunting) & Sadie Sink (Stranger Things) are also featured. Horror fans could give this a try at least once.",Eli
13,wandernn1-81-683274,Let's Go!!!,5,20 August 2020,"Okay so this movie keeps coming up for me as 'recommended' on several platforms so here we go.Start off with goofy looking kid running, begins to cough and then he's burning. Obviously a dream and he wakes up. Ahh he's a bubble boy. Ginger Mom loves him. Pills pills pills. Oh wow. Plastic suit and tape over clothes.Omg really. The motel owner tries to charge dude for an extra night for staying 3 minutes over?? I'd beat the living S$#% out of that motel dude for even suggesting such a thing.-1 Star already for that stupidity. That kind of thing really GRINDS MY GEARS.And as they are leaving the motel some trailer asshats outside throw firecrackers at the kid??? What part of the country are they in??? Surely that part of the country you can just shoot people that behave like that.Okay..moving on to road trip to see a doctor with family and bubble boy. They arrive and this high tech hospital and bubble boy enters first and has to go through some air lock chemical washing system. Ahh cool it's whats her name from Six Feet Under. Dr. Horn in this.

During which he falls asleep. When he wakes up he's restrained. He says he's burning!!! And of course he wakes up again from a dream.Eli, meets some girl at the wall / door to the outside of the hospital. Eli asks her to come inside the hospital The girl says she gets the creeps from the place and Dr. Horn doesn't like her. That's just odd.Eli then proceeds to explore with a flashlight. He finds an odd room with furniture covered in sheets. He starts seeing ghostly figures! Dad shows up just in time. But Eli is convinced that he really saw something!!!Dr. Horn meets with Eli's parents. She tells them that Eli is going to get worse before he gets better. This next treatment, they drill into Eli's skull. Dr. Horn explains that he's had an allergic reaction and that his body is going to have to get used to the new cells they are putting into him. Eli tells his parents that Dr. Horn is making him sicker. Dad puts it down plain. You wanna leave here and be sick forever or do you want to stay and get better??? Eli elects to stay.Eli tells the girl he met outside the walls that he thinks the place is haunted. This seems to be true when he starts getting dragged around by an invisible force. He is rescued by Dr. Horn. Oh he tells Dr. Horn he knows about Perry, the red haired girl told him about Perry , Dr. Horns former patient. Ruh Roh Dr. Horn looked pretty shocked that Eli knows about Perry!!!Eli figures out that the ghosts are giving him the message 317. Not LIE . Eli goes and enters the Code on a locked door! He finds another hallway full of rooms with other locked doors!! He finds one unlocked!!! wow he found Dr. Horn's bedroom!! He leaves and finds another room, a lab. He finds Dr. Horns office and starts going thru files!!! My my he's very informed / inquisitive for what? 11? 12? 13??Back to parents talking about what Dr. Horn told the Dad. Apparently Dr. Horn told the Dad there's a chance that he won't survive the next treatment! The Dad Starts yelling and wakes Dr. Horn! Eli is scared he might be discovered but that doesn't stop him from shining his flashlight all over!!! But Dr. Horn doesnt come for the office. Eli finds his own FILE! He also finds Perry's file And other files!!!! In the files, Treatment 3 kills every single former patient! Eli runs to tell mom and Dad, but mom and dad are not there in their room!!!Mom is outside and she wants to leave. Dr. Horn talks with her. But they are going to take Eli to treatment! Eli has seen the files!!! No one believes him!!! Dad , Mom, Dr. Horn, all are chasing him!! He barricades himself in a room! Oh dear! Did he just find a passage leading down into darkness???!! Oh nevermind there's all kinds of lights down there. And some sort of altar. Dr. Horn , Mom and Dad come down there and shut him in that altar room!!! What is going on here???Lol, Eli plays dead when his mom comes to talk to him and she comes in there and he clocks her in the face and escapes into the House again. His Dad is chasing him Okay the girl is outside again. Obviously she's some sort of ghost or something. Dr Horn sees her tho when they break in and snatch Eli.Mom wakes up in the altar room and discovers bodies buried in the covered well. She goes upstairs and tries to stop Dr. Horn! But what this is, they are trying to exorcise ELI . Dr. Horn and the nurses start praying over Eli!! Holy water is thrown on him, burning him. When Dr. Horn finally tries to stab him with the holy dagger, Eli starts displaying powers!!! Telekinetic powers!! LOL , I love what he does with the nurses...+1 Star for floating nurses!!!!So what did mom just confess?? Eli is the Son of the Devil? He walks out of the House trailng fire behind him. His Mom follows him out of the House. Turns out girl outside the wall is a child of the same Dad. Satan??And then they all leave and the house is burning so everyone else inside is dead. Damn he killed his Fake Dad too?? Mean.Okay really this was a pretty slow , boring movie with very little payoff at the end. Not very interesting dialogue at all. Acting was good and it was well filmed but other than that, nah. 5/10",Eli
14,jtindahouse,A strong blend of drama/horror/mystery all done in expert fashion,9,1 November 2019,"Each year on Halloween night I make a point of watching a horror movie that I have been highly anticipating to see. This year it was 'Eli'. In previous years they have been a bit of a bust for the most part, but this one was different. I could tell very early on in the film that this was going to be a very well made production. The director seemed to be in complete control of where he wanted to go and the actors all seemed to know exactly what their job was and were going about it perfectly. The end result was a very fine film.A lot of the film would fall more into the drama category than the horror category. Also there is a big mystery element to the film. Both the drama and mystery side of things are arguably the film's biggest strengths. There really are a lot of layers at play here, particularly once you've seen the entire film and know what was going on.It's a hard thing to pull off an ambitious film like this. It puts a lot on its own plate, but it manages to deal with it in expert fashion. When the film changes gear into horror mode it nails that too. In fact the final sequence of this film is a thing of beauty. I had a terrific time with 'Eli' and I would be very surprised if anyone watched this movie and didn't find at least one aspect of it they liked.",Eli
15,kevin_robbins,Definitely an original storyline and theme and well done.,7,25 May 2021,Jaz and I just watched this new Netflix original (just added this weekend). It was actually pretty good. Definitely an original storyline and theme and well done. The ending is fantastic. It was a 6.5/7 out of 10.,Eli
16,GiraffeDoor,Sort of OK for what it is. At one point they actually mention Tannis root...,7,14 January 2020,"Whenever the title for a movie is just a name or some other proper noun I always think ""pass: if that's the amount of creativity you bring you title then I'm not optimistic about your movie"".But I did watch Eli (pronounced ""Iilai"") eventually and although they sort of justified the title by the end i strongly feel that if you are going to watch this you need to commit to the idea that this is not a horror movie but a dark thriller which is a pertinent distinction at least to me...let me explain.This movie seems bizarre for a long amount of its runtime. I don't mean bizarre as in weird stuff happens but bizarre in its structure. It's funny I saw this the same weekend as ""The Monster"" because both movies share the same main flaw: their stories seem to employ to completely discrete sources of conflict. For Eli we have the immediate material conflict in the form of this medical home which is sufficient by itself to make us wonder what might go wrong if this is a horror movie. But at the same time we get more than the ""shifty"" doctor (SHOW DON'T TELL!!!), we get a series of strange sights we don't know what to make of. The direction the movie ultimately goes with this is beside the point, until then it's difficult to know what to do with this set of stimuli.These visions of, for example, things appearing in mirrors and then suddenly not being there (they do this twice in the same 10 second span). If they had established very early on that Eli should expect some hallucinations then this would have been fine and the movie could have kept its credibility as a horror that keeps its cards close to its chest. But not only is hallucination angle suggested far too late, they don't commit to keeping the movie Eli's subjective experience with pointless scenes involving the really annoying parents and the doctor.So the movie is far too up front with itself. It cannot really be the tense mysterious horror that it could have been and instead can only really be appreciated as a mystery albeit, one that does have its creepy moments but that is not the movie's main attraction. It sort of reminded me of the relatively darker stories they write for tweens. The plot here is certainly set on eventually telling you everything, you just have to be patient; not only of the time it takes but in how confusing a lot of it is. Mysteriousness is the skilful withholding of information, a movie becomes confusing when it inelegantly piles on the info.I've been very negative so far but the movie does have it's good points if you just, like I said, go in demanding only what it can deliver. The setting in that huge foreboding house is atmospheric and even gothic. They might have chosen to use an ultra-sceptic modernist building but they went vintage which was bold and effective. I wonder if the whole thing would have worked better if there were other patients so that the story of Eli and things that go bump in the night is not eclipsed by the intrigue of the hospital. Hospital? Is that the right word?Eli himself and the actor who plays him are immaculate. Conveying a lot of intense emotions without overdoing it. I'm not into little boys but if you are you might want to watch it all for him. But there is a cute girl too.So like I've said, go in without too much in the way of expectation and this isn't half bad. It develops nicely and avoids some of the more obvious roots if you don't overthink it. Not subtle but oddly professional.Slightly offensive to redheads but it's still nice that it's going against the values forced down our throat by ""The Conjuring"".",Eli
17,CubsandCulture,Why tell a compelling story when you can half ass three instead?,2,17 November 2019,"This is one of the worst films I have seen this year and it is largely due to the awful script. The direction and acting get a lot out of the atmosphere and some of the jump scares of the script so the film is engaging while watching it. However, once the big reveals happens you realize that the shell game of a plot is laughably absurd.The premise of the story changes 3 different times. Each change does not organically fit together and there is very little set-up between them. It is almost as if the screen writer had a medical drama, a psychological thriller and a supernatural horror scripts get mixed together. AND the changes in premise raises so many questions about what the characters were doing and what they thought they were doing. For starters why on Earth did Paul stay with Rose????This is a bad no good film!",Eli

Screenplay of the movie is very slow and could've better. Acting in the movie is average, it seems that Charlie Shotwell was trying too hard in some of the scenes. Cinematography was original and VFX were good. Climax was unimpressive.Overall an average horror movie which could've been good if the execution was good.",Eli

24,peterp-450-298716,A ghost-story? Wait for the denouement.,5,29 October 2019,"Do you know what happened to the boy who asked too many questions?
He got answers?""Eli"" is a horror you can watch on Netflix and it's not bad at all. But it takes a long time before the conclusion in the story surprises you completely. The introductory part reminded me a bit of ""Midnight Special"". A very young boy whose daily life is limited to a plastic-insulated room and who can't leave the house without wearing a weird looking sort of spacesuit. Apparently Eli (Charlie Shotwell) developed an autoimmune disease at a later age and exposure to outside air and sunlight is life-threatening to him. Together with his parents, Rose (Kelly ""10X10"" Reilly) and Paul (Max ""Spectral"" Martini), he's on his way to the only rescue that remains for him. A completely sterilized old mansion (a house that looks like a typical haunted house) where Dr. Horn (Lili Taylor) applies a specific gene therapy to treat medical cases such as Eli.After this medically oriented introduction, the focus shifts to the paranormal. Before you realize it, clichéd ghost phenomena are brought out. So the whole shebang you encounter in standard ghost stories, also appear here. From seeing ghosts in a mirror. To writings appearing in Eli's breath on a window. Although these are standard horror-film tricks, they are effectively used to startle you. But despite that, it's a long wait for the most important turn in the story at the end of the film. And this story-turn makes it a completely different story. At that moment you realize that all your guessing was completely wrong. So it's recommended to watch the film as a whole, so you get an answer to all the questions you asked yourself.Perhaps the strongest aspect of ""Eli"", is its mysterious character. What kind of treatment is it that Dr. Horn is practicing? Because you'll see that it's not such a conventional treatment. It's a rather painful procedure whereby a virus is injected into the spinal cord to repair the failing genes. And who are the ghosts tormenting him? Are they good-natured? Or malicious? That's something Eli is trying to discover for himself while locked up in this sterile cage. His parents and the medical staff blame the medication for these sightings and dismiss it as hallucinations. The only one who believes Eli is Haley (Sadie Sink), a local girl with whom Eli sometimes talks through a huge window. Where Haley comes from and what she does there is again a mystery. As time passes, the whole thing sounds a bit fishy to Eli.As I said before: ""Wait for the ultimate revelation"". Until then you have to endure a typical ghost story without too many highlights. Some praiseworthy words about Charlie Shotwell's acting. For such a young guy it's not so obvious to use a whole range of emotions. But to be honest, he convincingly did it. The other characters' contribution is fairly limited. Max Martini plays the determined father. Lili Taylor the mysterious doctor. And Kelly Reilly is no more than the worried mother who wants to hug her son again. It's not Reilly's most breathtaking acting performance. That's reserved for her role in ""Eden Lake"". All in all, ""Eli"" is not immediately an exciting film. But it's not extremely bad either. The only thing is, that it requires some patience. So waiting for the end is the message. And that's the last time I'm going to say that!This quote I found grossly exaggerated: ""New Netflix horror movie Eli is terrifying viewers to such an extent that some have claimed to be ""seeing demons"" after watching.""You can watch ""Eli"" on Netflix now!",Eli
25,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Interesting Haunted House with a Twist Film,7,5 January 2020,"This was a film that I heard about in the beginning of the year, but it seemed to keep getting pushed back. I was pretty excited when I saw there was some buzz thanks to the click bait articles about how terrifying this film is. My roommate even checked it out so I was intrigued to give it a viewing. The synopsis is a boy receiving treatment for his auto-immune disorder discovers that the house he's living in isn't as safe as he thought.We start this off with a boy, Eli (Charlie Shotwell) as he's walking across the yard. He seems hesitant, but runs toward his family. They're blurry and we can't really make them out. He ends up falling down and he can't breath. It turns out that he's living in an oxygen tent as he has an auto-immune disorder that will kill him if he's out in the normal air. We see his routine as things have to be clean and sealed for him to use them. His family is pretty much broke in trying to find a cure. His parents are Rose (Kelly Reilly) and Paul (Max Martini).They can't Eli to the middle of nowhere as there's a 'clean house'. He goes inside and it is run by Dr. Horn (Lili Taylor). From all accounts, she's great as an immunologist and has cured all patients that come to her. She is assisted by two nurses, Barbara (Deneen Tyler) and Maricela (Katia Gomez). Inside this house, Eli is able to leave his hazmat suit and walk around like normal. He's hesitant at first, but he's able to interact with his parents for the first time in awhile.Dr. Horn informs the family that it will take three treatments to cure Eli. They have to fix his genes with a virus that jumpstart his immune system and fix it. The problem though is that he starts to see ghosts in the house. On top of that, there's a girl that visits him, Haley (Sadie Sink). She tells him that Dr. Horn doesn't like her and that she is hiding something.Eli starts to distrust her and realizes that these ghosts that are visiting him might not be out to hurt him, but to reveal the truth of this place and what is going on. Dr. Horn is hiding something, but it isn't necessarily what Eli thinks. He's convinced she's not there to help him, but kill him. Paul wants to cure Eli as does his mother, but the more Rose learns, the less she's on board.Now I have to say, this film really does have some interesting aspects to it for sure. The first thing is that I like the idea of having Eli inside of what could be a potentially haunted house. He can't just leave and his parents don't believe that he's actually seeing ghosts. That also makes it a contained horror film, which I tend to be a big fan of. To add to this as well, Dr. Horn tells the parents that the treatments she's giving can make him hallucinate. I like this angle as we as viewers don't know he's really seeing these things or is it all in his head. I will say though, this film goes to the dream sequence a few times. I liked the initial one as it's a good way to establish his ailment. What I didn't like was to use it possible explain away some of the ghostly encounters.We get some interesting reveals in this story as well. We learn that Dr. Horn isn't necessarily telling the truth about everything. I like the more we learn, Paul and Rose are both hiding things as well. Haley is interesting in planting the seeds of doubt with Eli as she interacted with the other children who were treated here. I really want to delve into this more so I am going to have a spoilers section in the bottom so I can do so.If there's something about this movie I had issues, part of it was with the pacing. I like how it introduced us to Eli and his family. I also like how they introduce Dr. Horn and the facility she is running. There are some subtle things that we get that make a lot of sense later on and that includes Haley and some of the things she reveals. I wasn't necessarily into the ghostly aspects, but I came around to the reveal of what is really going on here. The climax sequence though pulled me right in and I really enjoyed where they took it.That will take me to the acting of this film. I didn't mind Shotwell overall. I try not to be hard on children actors as there are so few that are really good. I did find him annoying at times, but I am also forgiving as he's been living in an enclosure, not being able to experience the world around him. I would probably be ornery myself. Reilly and Martini are both solid. I think there's some subtle interaction between the two that make so much sense at the reveal. I like Taylor. She's an actress that I saw in the genre and really has emerged as scream queen of sorts with her catalogue in the genre. I like that she is presented as the villain with an interesting reveal. Sink is good for what her role needed as well as Tyler and Gomez. The children that play the ghosts are also fine as well.The effects in this film weren't the greatest. They are mostly CGI, which makes sense as that is the easiest thing to do for the ghosts we get here. I don't think they look any better than the low budget ghostlies that we see regularly coming out. I did like what they did to show when Eli's disorder is killing him and I also liked what they did during the climax. I do think that it is shot well, especially in their use of mirrors.Now with that said, this film was one that I thought was solid. It did lose my interest until the reveal and then I was back on board. I liked that it is contained where this child cannot go out into the world due to an auto-immune disorder. The reveal of the truth of everything I really liked. The acting I thought was pretty solid and the CGI was kind of hit or miss. The soundtrack didn't really stand out to me, but it also didn't hurt. It did fit for what was needed. Overall I'd say this is above average overall.My Rating: 7 out of 10SPOILERSAs Eli learns that these ghosts are not trying to hurt him, the message they leave isn't just telling him that Dr. Horn is lying, it is also the code to the door that will take him to the medical wing. Haley reveals as well that she communicated with Perry (Austin Foxx) who also saw ghosts. Dr. Horn told Eli and his parents that is not the case. Once he finds the files, we learn that the ghosts are actually the former patients of Perry, Agnes (Kailia Posey) and Lucius (Parker Lovein). None of them survived treatment four.Another reveal is that Dr. Horn is a former nun. There's a moment where Eli is locked in the basement which is similar has an odd Christian like alter as well as what seems to be a well. Rose ends up seeing that Eli was right, Dr. Horn has been killing the children. It turns out though that Paul is not his father, Eli is the son of the devil. They're trying to exorcise him. He uses his power to kill Dr. Horn and the two nurses. Also that Haley is his half-sister, as she's also a demon. I'm really into the corruption of religion and humanity, so I dug this. I like the interaction where Paul makes snide remakes so I knew that Rose cheated, just not in the way that I was expecting. I do feel they could have slid some more things to help us get there as I do feel it comes out of nowhere. The nun reveal happened a bit too late to go down this path. The ghosts were also trying to keep Eli as there also his weaker half-brothers and sisters.",Eli
26,fntstcplnt,Eli (2019),4,18 October 2019,"Directed by Ciarán Foy. Starring Charlie Shotwell, Kelly Reilly, Lili Taylor, Max Martini, Sadie Sink, Deneen Tyler, Katia Gomez. (TV-MA)Suffering from a rare immune deficiency that makes him dangerously allergic to the outdoors, young Eli (Shotwell) is carted off to a sheltered facility so he can undergo grueling experimental treatments to cure him. But not long after arriving, Eli begins witnessing spooky events that make him question just how aboveboard this practice is and what exactly happened to the patients before him. Director Foy, who previously helmed the ""Sinister"" sequel, knows his way around ghostly apparitions and jump scares (though they're commonplace tricks by now that have lost most of their effect). The young actors are above average for the genre, and Taylor (as the head doctor) is always a welcome presence; the parents (Reilly and Martini), however, are forced to be awkward and elusive because of secrets they're keeping--one conversation they have alone in their bedroom rings especially false. But then there are those late-game twists, which are so unimaginably preposterous that they turn a run-of-the-mill ghost movie into a howlingly outrageous (if entirely unintentional) comedy. Not an ending that will easily be forgotten, no matter how much you may wish it would be.44/100",Eli

28,gedikreverdi,Eli(e),6,20 February 2021,"Until the twist at the very end, it seemed like an average haunting story. Eli has a autoimmune disorder that made him impossible to come in contact with the outside world. His parents took him to a mansion in the middle of nowhere where a doctor would cure him with two nurses. The mansion was clean of the outside world particles. Eli started seeing ghosts of kids. Haley who's a girl coming to talk to him from the garden told him about the previous boy's story about ghosts. When his mother told him that he's not actually sick when he found out he could breath out in the basement, I just thought it's another manchausen by proxy syndrome case. However, when the last procedure was about to be performed by the seemingly doctor catholic nuns, he took the stab in midair with his eyes and stabbed Miss Horn and started to spin them in the room until burning them. He also killed his father too and his mother confessed that he made a deal with his father, the Devil. They took off as the house was on fire. Haley called his name and she also turned out to be a daughter of the devil too. His mother drove the car and they all went to see their father. Although it has some cliches like the devil hating the cross etc., it was a nice surprise for me because I heard nobody praising this film",Eli

Ali's mother sometimes help her son sometimes seems to capture him. What is real ? If they are demon the why do they take their son to another demon place ? And if they are human then why do they can't smell of a big conspiracy or get hint of bad happening ? These are unanswerable questions as me and all ending drama looks illogical.

No cherry on the top, no fat lady singing, just a premise and an execution to match it, till the very end.Sure, I will recommend this one, because it delivers far more and better than most such productions out there, don't try to guess the final act, no point into it really, just enjoy it for as long as you can.

33,SoumikBanerjee25,Some people took this film way seriously!,7,4 May 2020,"Guys, Chill. It's a film; don't take it too seriously. We have already seen so many films with satanic rituals, Devil Worshipping before but this time it got interesting. It innovatively presented us the same dish but in a different manner! It's different from the rest but I was totally into it and kinda liked the climax too. I know many of you might disagree with me here. But I liked how it turned around the whole plotline towards the end.
Shockingly Indeed.From the very beginning I was fondling through various interpretations about the storyline. For your information as a movie buff I try to predict certain outcomes whenever I watch a movie; especially with these horror films where I certainly do that very often. As you may all know horror genre nowadays are filled with craps and more of the same. Most of the times they tend to take the same route of scaring us. Today most of the horror movies became so predictable that if you are into this genre like as much as I am; you would surely know what's coming before it even starts. That's how bad the scenario of horror movies come to.Fortunately for this film, can't say the same. I was searching over different possibilities and outcome from the storyline but believe me I couldn't really tell what was going to happen in the next act. When the climax came over I was literally shocked. I never thought it would come to that sort of conclusion. But I honestly liked it. Not because of how it baffled me throughout but for the Clever execution it had. I really liked Eli's character, and was really feeling empathetic towards him. So for me It was a satisfying end nonetheless.Now let's talk about the other aspects as well.
The cinematography is fine, the soundscore is truly impressive. The positional audio experience was something I really cherish. Specially when in Horror where it matters a lot. Performances are quiet good as well. The Storyline is not that intriguing nor compact enough until the 3rd act. I expected more from the individual Characters as well. Also Some scenes felt a bit overstretched. Perhaps the makers tried to bring the 'Artsy' feel over it.Overall this is a very good movie. Although it Wasn't really scary. But the twists and turns surely made up for that. Fellow horror fans go for it. And for the others; You could definitely watch it as well.Recommended!",Eli

In the flashback they show his skin frying up when he's in the sun, or breaking out in hives when he tears a hole in his hazmat suit. They should have just convinced the kid that he was sick and not show the symptoms.If he's the son of the devil, where were his powers all this time, why did they only come out at the end? Why did Paul stay with Rose even after knowing that she had sex with the devil, if ever there was a reason to leave your spouse, that would have to be it. Paul gives up everything he owns to help the devil's kid, like that would ever happen. Make it believable, people. I don't understand the emphasis on the insects, are they supposed to symbolize something? If the kid is evil, show him doing evil things earlier in the film, don't just show him suddenly being evil in the last ten minutes. The ending is kind of cutesy and stupid, the girl's eyes flash briefly with hellfire as she's talking to Eli, it's the kind of thing they would do on a low-budget TV show.",Eli

41,nitzanhavoc,Not terrible!,6,21 November 2020,"As with pretty much anything I find on Netflix (especially when it comes to Horror films), I approached Eli with little to no expectations. That's the only way to enjoy a Netflix movie - expect the worse for the off chance that you'd be pleasantly disappointed. Horror is a very neglected genre, so add to that Netflix's vow of overpriced mediocrity - and you should pretty much expect any Horror film there to be terrible (not according to the trolls here, actually terrible). This method really proves itself when it comes to Eli.Eli suffers from one of these immuno-deficiency diseases familiar to most of us from one show or another. Even breathing unfiltered air would pretty much kill him, slowly and painfully. Hearing of a specialist expert running a top notch medical facility - his parents spend their final cents trying to get him the help he needs. However, as the trailer and description show, something is off about the center, the doctor, and pretty much everything.Most of Eli's misadventures around the facility are quite off-putting, thanks to the shameless use of physiological cheats (i.e. 'jump-scares"") in every other scene. It works, of course, you get startled and have to catch your breath, but there's nothing creative or remotely impressive about it. Yes, ""jump-cares"" are startling just like erotic scenes are arousing, it's the human body being itself and nothing more. When that's the scariest thing about a Horror film - you know you're witnessing a failure. Then again, not every Horror film needs to be an instant classic or a masterpiece for the ages. As long as it's fun - it works. And yes, Eli succeeds in being fun. Mostly because the audience doesn't really know what to expect and what's actually going on until the final scenes.And speaking of the final scenes - a plot twist is one of the most important features of a Horror film, it's what makes good (or even average) movies great. But it has to make the minimal amount of sense. Eli's ending is, well, trying to combine the best (or at least good) of two worlds and ending up putting delicious hot fudge on sweet and sour chicken. Some things are great in and of themselves, but should never mix. The idea was quite original and required some courage to attempt, but like I've said - a failure.All in all, Eli isn't great, it's not even good. And yet, you don't finish it feeling like you've watched something terrible or wasted your time. It could be an entertaining experience, as long as you don't mind trademark Netflix mediocrity at its worse, and you aren't expecting anything impressive. Considering we're talking about Netflix - Eli just might be the only decent Horror film to watch right now (I didn't check), so lower your standards and try to enjoy. At least a little.",Eli

43,LloydBayer,Redeemed by its major twist ending.,6,13 June 2020,"When seen solely as a horror film, this one has nothing new to offer. Packed with the usual and rather standard jump scares, Eli will seem like a fairly predictable horror film that you can yawn through. But as a horror/mystery, there is something else at work here, albeit with intent to throw us off. It works, and largely due to the fact that we are misdirected from the beginning, given to believe that the titular character is in need of a rare medical procedure to cure his auto-immune deficiency. His parents have spent a considerable sum of money that requires isolated treatment (and here begins the clichés) in a scary looking mansion. As the mystery unravels, so does everything else we have seen before - dark corridors, foggy mirrors, apparitions in the mirror, contorted creatures - which Eli is a victim of, and no one believes him. All this is thrown in, with intent, for two reasons. The first is to prolong the running time, which is never a good thing. But the second reason is where this film is redeemed - the major twist at the end that has the story spinning on its own head. It's a twist that viewers with either love or hate, but definitely one most won't see coming.",Eli
44,TwistedContent,A Horror Both Generic and Surprising,5,18 October 2019,"Ciarán Foy (Citadel, Sinister 2) offers us his... spin on a haunted house tale & it turned out very bittersweet, half cooked. Decent cast, big budget looks & easy access has the potential of providing You with an evening of horror entertainment, but it might not be the most satisfactory kind.Our main hero Eli has a condition - allergy to the outside world, to put it simply. His parents take him to a doctor who promises to cure him & oh no, it will all take place in an old, creepy looking mansion. The script is pretty twisty and IMDb should add mystery alongside the horror genre. It's hard to talk about ""Eli"" without the risk of spoilers, but I can tell you that for the most part of its runtime it feels shabby, there can be a few eye-rolling moments. After the first hour a.k.a. the most questionable, generic and boring part of the movie the script starts changing the direction it's heading for. Lucky for us, the 3rd act pays off way better & even though the twists didn't impress me much, they kinda saved the whole movie. The equal parts generic and twisty story is carried out by solid acting and a bit less solid characters, the best casting choice is probably Lili Collins as the doctor. Also, I've always enjoyed watching Kelly Reilly - this time she got the painfully familiar mom character & did it justice, but that's all it was - painfully familiar. Visually ""Eli"" feels like a big budget flick, there are few memorable frames, great FX (albeit lots of paranormal horror cliche scares and effects) and well done cinematography. Even though ""Eli"" is rated R, for the most part it feels like a pg-13 movie, showing of that R closer to its end.There are a lot of generic, commercial haunted house movies out there, it wouldn't be quite fair to throw this one in with the rest - ""Eli"" is a corny but twisty and likeable enough horror movie that just doesn't always work. I'm sure a lot of people will get more kicks out of it than I did, but after 1000 horror movies ""Eli"" failed to scare, impress or affect me much. My rating: 5/10.",Eli

There are countless movies with children and their dark secrets, millions of movies with old and dark manor houses and plenty of boring stories being told. Not so in ELI, pretty much from the start it develops a very eerie and special atmosphere. You can tell something is going on but it was impossible for me to figure out where it would lead to. What's the treatment for? What happened to the other kids? What's wrong with the parents? The ghosts play an interesting role as well as they are not doing what u think there are up for.

His mother is a dumb bimbo who makes him believe he is allergic to the outside world, so she keeps him indoors in a sealed suit, just to protect him from...what? Satan? No, that can't be, because she is married to him.The mom brings him to a nut-job ex-nun to cure him of...what? She made up his malady. And the little girl outside who befriends him is...what? His half sister? And what is she doing there? And why does the nut-job ex-nun recognize her? ('Oh, it's you' she says to the girl.) Then, when the mom and Eli are going to leave, the Jeep they came in mysteriously explodes into flames, but what? The Jeep is back to normal and the mother, half-sister and Eli drive away to go meet Eli's father, so does that mean the man who professed to be his real dad was not his dad but...what? The son of Satan? No, that would be Eli. Eli's mom makes up with him at the end, and all is forgiven, but what? Is it because she made him put on his coat because it was cold outside? (Because everyone knows the devil likes the heat.)I am putting this under spoilers, even though I have NO idea what went on here.

It's quite clear the character Eli is at the beginning of his journey. And I believe if it was a series instead of a movie it would've been better. So keeping that in mind there were some scenes I feel could have been less predictable or more original because I couldn't stop thinking about the film ""Brightburn"" while watching ""Eli"" even though it's a totally different story and it does have it's own merits. The Videography and production for this film is stunning with amazing camera angles and special Efx the tone of the film is bleak but it was very enjoyable to watch. The acting held true it wasn't the best performance from the Amazing Kelly Reilly but it sufficed as all the acting did but throughout the middle there were scenes that just seemed to fill the timeline and prepare for the finale that I feel albeit very brief was a good payoff. Obviously most horror fans will want more it wasn't a frightening film it mainly lands on thriller but it was a movie I would reccomend to watch and will wait for the next ones to fill that void and pick up where it left off.",Eli

When a boy with some sort of auto-immune disorder, arrives at a treatment facility with his parents, he hopes to get cured and finally live a normal life.Eli (Charlie Shotwell), at first hopeful, meets Dr. Horn (Lili Taylor) at her lush yet minimalistic mansion - fully equiped to house patients with conditions such as the young boy's. When getting the grand tour of the house, Eli notices shadows lurking in the corners. After his first of three treatments, where Dr. Horn and her loyal team of nurses take tissue samples, the teenager wakes up in his room haunted by seemingly malicious spirits, scaring him into his parents bedroom. When trying to explain this to the team of professional scientists, they quickly file this under hallucinations from the anaesthesia. But when things seem to get worse and worse with every day passing, and treatments getting more intense, Eli uncovers secrets that lie deep within the facility, that will turn his own and everyone else's lives upside down with apocalyptic consequences.Ciarán Foy (Sinister 2) isn't new to the horror genre and directs this with much needed confidence. Some jump scares don't land, but I have to admit when some heavily mutilated children run towards you out of nowhere, you'll try and duck away. It also helps when your director of photography (Jeff Cutter - 10 Cloverfield Lane) knows how to put things in perspective and gives you angles others might not even think of. The score by Bear McCreary (Godzilla II: King of the Monsters) also gives you the much needed suspense as soon as the film starts.Charlie Shotwell (Captain Fantastic), who plays our titular character, has to carry this entire film on his own, and he partially succeeds. His screaming and yelling gets quite tiring after a while, but he definitely lands the more serious and dramatic scenes. Kelly Reilly (Yellowstone) is the other standout, playing Eli's mother with much needed intensity and depth to embody her character's struggles as a caring parent.Unfortunately, the always strong Lily Taylor, who has starred in scary movies such as 'The Conjuring' and 'The Haunting' is particularly weak as Dr. Horn. Not only does her character play a big part in the reveal around Eli's disease, but it's pivotal to the entire storyline. Emotionless and boring, Taylor didn't seem to know what went on in this story. Max Martini (Fifty Shades Freed), also laughably overacts as Eli's father.'Eli' is part 'The Boy in the Plastic Bubble', part 'The Others' and part 'Rosemary's Baby'.

Eli's parents decide to take him to a secluded medical facility as a last ditch effort to cure his condition. Turns out the facility is so-called ""clean house"" with recycled air and an airlock for a front door and is specifically designed for people with this condition.
Eli undergoes a couple of treatments and begins seeing apparitions. They gradually become violent dragging him around the house and trying to remove him to the outside.
We learn that Eli is not actually sick and his affliction is the result of a pact his mother made with the devil and his last administered treatment is supposed to be as a sacrifice. The nurses are actually nuns who have done this before and after Eli realises his powers he kills them all, including his human father and he escapes with his mother to meet Satan, his real father.

I was wondering if I should rate it 10 stars, but nothing is perfect. This movie seems to answer all the questions it brings. The details that are hinted seem to be answered, eventually throughout the film. I'm thinking it was well done, not too short, not too long, answered the questions, seems to have potential for a sequel, maybe, but that may be complicated writing. I decided to rate a 9, maybe as I subconsciously feel it could've been slightly better in writing and maybe the others could've been more pronounced, BUT this is my own questioning. I'm not trying to take away from the film. I think it was great. I might be able to watch again, despite the ending being revealed, already. If I were a teenager, I'd be scared! I'm 33 adult male.

74,pal05052003,An entertaining slow burning horror,7,8 April 2020,"Eli is a decent slow burning horror about a kid with auto-immune disorder who discovers that his doctor might have sinister motives. The plot is interesting, and it was told from the point of view of the protagonist Eli. Charlie Shotwell, who plays the titular Eli, was great at portraying boyish rebelliousness and vulnerability. Throughout, we can feel his fears, and understand his reaction and frustration. Shotwell's suspicion is believable because of Lily Taylor's role as the doctor; who seems a bit suspicious. A welcome surprise is Sadie Sink as a mysterious friend that Eli befriends. She steals the show from Eli. As for the scares, there are hardly any jump scares but the payoff is a bit underwhelming. The finale seemed too similar to Brightburn, and the obsession Eli's mother has with her son seems forced. Another problem is the tension between Eli's mother and Eli's father is never fully explained. It shows extreme tension but nothing is done to explain the tension. However, despite the flaws, Eli is one of the entertaining horrors with decent scares. If you are free, try it.",Eli

Then I realize it must be a reaction to holy water, but if they only started infusing him now then I have no idea how it was happening before.. unless they gave him glasses of holy water to drink in his bubble? The mother confused me the most when she went from seeming ignorant, to being in on it, then back to being ignorant again. I was also waiting for the reveal that the doctor wasn't even a doctor based on her poor techniques like using a vice on someone's head instead of sedation, and then what was the awkwardly acted out bone marrow procedure for??

While undergoing a series of experimental treatments, Eli begins to unravel the facilities shady secrets with a little help from local girl Haley (Sadie Sink). Eli isn't exactly the most original horror film out there, but it's a fun enough watch with plenty of intrigue and a satisfying (if not completely mental) twist ending. It isn't perhaps as chilling as the screenwriters would have liked and can become a little repetitive at times, but what keeps Eli afloat is the mysterious nature of the facilities past as well as the solid performances.

This movie has actors with good credentials and can do some excellent acting. For the most part, the acting level was on holiday. Kelly Reilly and Lili Taylor have both chosen good and bad projects, so I'm not very surprised. Hey, it's tough to make a living in the entertainment field I know from personal experience on the music side of things. But I'm drifting off topic, sorry. Boy in the Bubble meets any of the many poorly done exorcism movies. I agree with a few who wrote that the movie would have been better had there not been that extra final plot twist. I'm not sure I can agree 100% had that final twist been set up and written in a better way. I wish the story gave an explanation what the 'treatments' were aside from brutal. So many silly things all written about the house not being a 'Clean House' are correct. Anyone who truly has such an extreme form of autoimmune disease simply cannot be in contact with anyone or anything not completely devoid of all microscopic life. This made me feel the movie was just plain stupid until the ending when the first twist happens. Then it goes into a Satan spawn movie and how very few of those ever make for a well done movie? Oh well, I'll just enjoy the time getting to look at the beautiful Kelly Reilly and call it done never to be repeated. I'll stick with the 'old school' flicks about satan related material such as Deadly Blessing, The Exorcist (original), The Omen, Constantine, Rosemary's Baby, The Ninth Gate, To The Devil A Daughter (I'll bet very few have ever heard of this movie. A bit of trivia...this was the last movie ever produced by the original Hammer Films. And if you like to be truly creeped out, I highly recommend giving this one a watch.) and Prince of Darkness (in my opinion, the most unique take on this genre. This is a John Carpenter film and I really think he made something quite well done, a bit over the top acting, etc., yet some still very creepy scenes added to this very unique story.) All of these movies were well done, well acted, and if you get nightmares from the implied possibility that any of these movies storylines could possibly happen and gives you nightmares.

Some fans will recognise that it is isn't just the jump scares that can be repetitive and trite, but the overall look and motion of the 'supernatural' elements appear to be lifted straight out of the post-Ring horror effects textbook.
The ending certainly begs viewers to watch in enough numbers to justify giving birth to a franchise.
Overall this is a film that will suffice to please horror fans, though some will, like myself, feel the religious angle overdone and implausible.
For the rest, it's not the worst way to kill a couple of hours.",Eli

110,its-me6611,An amazing film with solid scares and performance,8,29 November 2019,"8/10The film starts well and gets better except for the ending.Plot: Eli has auto-immune disorder and as a last ditch effort to cure him, his parents take him to an experimental and highly expensive treatment center. As the treatment starts Eli begins to question the objective of his doctor. Also he is being haunted by ghosts.The first part of the film is slow and mostly revolves around the question if the hauntings are real of the side effects of the gene therapy that he is receiving. The scary scenes were well done. The film is worth a watch just for those part alone.Around 70 minutes into the film I could see that a twist might be coming, it took some time to get there and there, all the answers we were asking for.
About the twist, the good thing is I did not expect it but the bad thing is that it took away the satisfaction of watching a well-made film.The casting is perfect for Eli (Charlie Shotwell) and his mother Rose (Kelly Reilly). The acting was top notch. The role of the doctor played by Lili Taylor was the only character that made sense after the twist was shown. Rest of the character seemed like did a 180.Two things I did not like, first, the whole first part of the film seems like made to mislead and has nothing to with the reality shown in the film. Second the world depicted here seemed so small.An amazing film with solid scares and performance. Deserves a better rating the current 5.8/10.",Eli

The family are hoping that a proceedure called viral gene therapy can offer a cure for Eli as they visit Dr. Horn, in an old creepy mansion that holds a pretty snazzy decontamination chamber upon entry. But when Eli is being put to sleep for his operation he's not sure if he sees something he's not supposed to!All in all it was an average watch, a bit cliché in that somebody sees things and others don't believe them, suspecting them to be going crazy, you see it all too often.

Eli starts to feel unwell and begins witnessing ghosts that no one else can see and learns there's some dark secrets behind the medical team.First of all, I can say that after seeing this film I've experienced no nightmares and haven't seen any sort of demon. It was pretty good for a Netflix original and had scenes that nearly had me jumping.
As it gets towards the end when the twist is revealed, it kinda went a bit meh. The twist was something I didn't expect till just before the reveal, but the script and story from then on was just a bit of a eye roll and could've been a lot better and darker.I love my horror films, and I really enjoyed this film up until the twist reveal, but it's still a good watch and impressive for a Netflix Original film.",Eli

I started this movie without having seen any trailers, hearing any reviews or knowing anyone who's watched it.
So I went in with an open mind and I'm so glad I did. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time, constantly questioning what the ghosts he was seeing were. I was wondering whether he was just a sick boy, maybe he was the ghost, maybe this clinic was something that dealt with pseudoscience. But I was not expecting the turn of events at the end!
Holy hell, pardon the pun!
When people start meddling with the devil and demons, it can be old and stale. It's been done a billion times before. But this was surprising, and I really enjoyed it! Child of Satan! Wow. Really enjoyed this movie and have recommended it to a few people already.

The plot is something a little different with the real twist coming quite late in the movie, though there's some hints throughout if you are attentive.
The acting is good but looking back there wasn't much of a connection to the characters, I wasn't routing for them.
I think the script tried a little hard to be uncommitted to his illness to allow for the twist but it halted the natural flow of the storyline as a result.

134,info-33728-30040,Decent flick with an impressive surprising twist!,5,22 October 2019,"The pace was good, but not really scary. Good story, and yet it still managed to fall flat somehow. I am not sure what it is missing, but it was definitely missing something, and continuity for sure wasn't stellar.The ghost parts could have really been better developed to really suggest hallucinations as the movie evolved. It felt way too rushed and hurried loosing the steady incline to really crafting a spookier element.I was also rather annoyed that the wardrobe door was just left there for so long after it served its purpose. That didn't seem real at all, and while part of thinks it was a visual cue to 'being unhinged' or something like that, it did not work.There was also something not right with the character of the mother, especially near the end - it was like a scene that explained more about her character before the big reveal was missing and completely lost its congruency damaging the overall integrity of the character. In addition there was a scene in the beginning of the film where Kelly Reilly's English accent was very apparent. How was that missed in the editing room?There was also a glitch in the story delivery from the beginning when the credit card was refused and then the reveal, which would suggest that the church would have paid for all the expenses of the trip? I feel that was a bit weak and really could have been played with a bit more creating more dialogue with the parents.The twist was worth watching the movie. Worthy of a one time watch for sure. Both Charlie Shotwell and Kelly Reilly's performance was great. Lili Taylor is always great, although it didn't feel like she was feeling her character all the time.",Eli

I loved the premise of this movie, a loveable kid with a weakened immune system so he's unable to go outside without the help of a hazmat suit, his parents playing the role of sad mother and father who desperately want their son to live a full life, goes into a 'haunted' house unknown to them and away we go. Sounds like my kind of movie.The first 3/4 of the movie go as swimmingly. The poor boy has tests and procedures etc, meets a girl who warms him about the house, everything normal for a horror.It's the last 1/4 of this movie which was a huge fail for me, I enjoyed the acting the whole way through, from all parties involved but how suddenly both parents changed their minds after their son says he's going to be killed, and finding dead children in the basement is all a little too yikes in my book.Then there's the devil's spawn/son bit, that's too cringe to talk about.This could have been a decent movie if the last 1/4 was changed to fit the rest.",Eli

Although the twist was good, it did go to far trying to twist on a twist. The acting was relatively mediocre. Passable. Things that annoyed me was how unclean the 'clean' house was, to make the plot believeable at the start. Yes, I know the sickness thing wasn't what it seemed but there was a lot of ridiculous plot fails around that, including treatment scenes. An okay idea but a bit poorly done.",Eli

While at the old mansion strange things start to happen that only Eli can see and experience.

153,iamMarkPrice,"It's watchable, but you'll hate yourself afterwards",3,20 October 2019,"Eli tells the story of a 10 year old boy name Eli (played by Charlie Shotwell) and his family as he seeks treatment for his rare genetic condition.From the outset set design is minimalist in a vacant kind of way, with a similar problem with lighting leading to some off looking frames, despite a solid effort from the camera operators to work with what they have. Direction by Ciaràn Foy (of Sinister 2 and Citadel) comes across loose and disorganised suntracting from the overall film itself.Acting is weak across the board with particularly cringeworthy performances by Shotwell's lead and Lili Taylor's (the Nun, The Haunting and Ransom) Dr Horn.The story starts out strong tracking the family on their journey to get treatment for Eli, and the film does a good job in those early scenes of giving us at least a surface level understanding of what the family have gone through to get to where we join them in a somewhat natural way.But what starts out strong, doesn't stay that way for long with the film quickly descending into a jumbled mess of horror tropes and clichè. This film foreshadows hard, like, really hard across every single frame start to finish, even the name, letting you know there is going to be a big twist at the end and what that twist will be. When it finally comes your natural reflex will be to roll your eyes, just be sure to not give in all the way to that urge for you might go blind.For a film made with $11M you have to wonder where that money went, because it certainly didn't go where it could be used most, component writers, casting and an art / electrical departments budget.

166,josephbrewster-88279,"Don't read about it, just watch it",7,30 January 2021,"Summary: a good movie, descent on all fronts. Not terrifying, but sufficiently suspenseful, boasting a curious twist and a surprise ending. Most reviews contain spoilers because it's impossible to discuss the post-watch experience without ruining the movie. My spoilers come later, so you're safe for another paragraph.I went into this one blind and was pleasantly surprised by the quality. With no expectations, watching Netflix horror is mildly entertaining some of the time and pleasantly surprising at other times. This falls into the latter category. A sick young boy (allergic to pretty much anything outside), flanked by apparently loving parents with underlying marriage issues, winds up at an off-the-beaten-track specialist doing gene modification for children with his condition. His condition, being that he can't go outside without the risk of dying. Air, water, everything is the enemy due to an auto-immune disorder. From the first moments at the facility, we know something is wrong, but it's difficult to guess what-and you'll guess plenty, though you'll likely be wrong as you wade through the jump scares and spooky hall shots (with flickering lights, of course). Stick it out. The ending is probably going to surprise you, but it also might disappoint you to an extent as you reflect on the plot up until the third act.SPOILER ALERT: as treatment progresses, Eli sees ghosts, or one ghost in particular, which seems to be trying to attack or at least communicate with Eli. His devout Christian family (well, Dad seems skeptical) isn't buying his stories as reality, but rather side effects of the medication. On several occasions the word ""lie"" is written by the ghost(s), eluding to some mystery yet to be revealed in this squeaky clean medical facility led by the sincere Dr. Horn and her odd staff. Eli meets a friendly, but feisty, red headed girl on the outside who lured him away for brief ominous conversations. She is not liked by the nuns. The ghosts attempt to drag Eli from the facility at some point, unsuccessfully, and he voices the suspicion maybe they are trying to help him. Any time Eli is exposed to the outside, as well as during his treatments, he develops a severe rash all over his body and is in mortal danger. He screams and experiences pain which sends him into hysterics.In act 3, we discover this is just psychological. His parents have conditioned him to be terrified of the outside. I know I was waiting on the over protective evangelical parent trope to be trotted out, but no. It gets better. The ghosts weren't scribbling ""LIE"" they were writing ""317"" upside down (why?) which is the code for the medical wing. He finds files that arouse his suspicion. At this point he still thinks he's in a medical facility, but no. His parents aren't just over protective Christians, they have rightfully brought him to a covert pseudo-exorcism facility with nuns who are trying to treat demon children. Eli is the Devil's spawn (the mom is biological) and he's actually a danger to the outside world, therefore they had to convince him never to go out. In the third act, he discovers all the previous treatments have failed and the children were intentionally killed by doctor Horn, who is trying to cure them of the satanic side of their nature, but is willing to save their soul through ritual execution if necessary.Eli ""comes of age"" you might say, embracing his demonic powers, killing everyone but his mom and torching the building all in one glorious climax that might leave a few scratching their heads. He meets up outside with Samantha, the red-headed friend who we learn is a legit demon spawn also. With mom at the wheel they drive off into the night, the burning medical facility that's actually an exorcism chamber left in the dust.It's fun. It's surprising. It's not half bad. But...
You're probably going to ask a few questions on further contemplation.
(1) If Eli is a powerful Devil spawn, why does he have zero supernatural ability until a decisive moment in the final act when he seems to suddenly know how to precisely wield this power to do complex multitasked murders and elemental tricks with little or no attention.
(2) If, as the final scene details, they were actually just injecting holy water in Eli the whole time to try and ""cure"" his demonic side, why drill into his leg? Why drill into his head? What exactly was happening? Are these exorcism rights we've just never seen in horror before? Don't ask, I guess?
(3) So mom prays to satan, gets a kid, and at some point decides he needs to be frightened into believing he's sick then taken to an exorcist...but, why? In no way are we led to believe he's been a problem up to this point. He seems like a nice kid. Did they always know this would need to happen? Could they not have been injecting him with holy water from birth? Surely we missed something in the plot which would have warranted this fear and desperation on the part of the parents.
(4) What exactly is the purpose of all the lying and elaborate medical-themed sham of this whole facility? They don't need an air-tight house. Do all parents with demon kids push this psychotic ""outside will kill you"" narrative so the ""clean room"" story makes sense to each incoming child? Is there a demon parent conspiracy worldwide? It seems like they could have just done a few exorcisms and skipped a lot of BS and fabrication, especially given the abysmal success rate.
(5) why do the ghosts oddly haunt him, doing twisty contortions, shadow puppets and writing a numerical code upside down to look like a word. Sure, it's clever visually, but it's stupid for ghosts trying to communicate to be so vague. The whole cast, both the Christians and the devils, are essentially lying through their teeth about literally everything all the time, and it feels a bit overdone in retrospect.Still, good movie. I like it, despite its rough edges.",Eli
167,forpassord,Light horror built upon a HUGE plot hole or two.,4,24 October 2019,"The acting, the special effects, sound and picture quality, the lines as such are all good in this movie. The plot twist is absolutely original, but I wonder if it took things too far? And this ""horror movie"" is not very frightening either. There was a couple of incidents that were exciting, but not much more.I initially planned to give this movie a 7/10. But after a little while it dawned on me how enormous the plot hole(s) in this movie really is/are: The story is built upon the auto-immune disorder that Eli supposedly have, but later just turns out to be something his parents uses to isolate him from from everything and everyone. BUT: During the movie you can see several times that Eli develops skin rashes when exposed to a normal atmosphere. By all means, i know about the nocebo effect, BUT COME ON!!A smaller/another plot hole concerns the air lock between the outside world and the inside of the building. To me it just seemed to prevent the atmosphere on the outside from entering the inside of the building freely. How this is supposed to prevent all the pathogens on persons and on persons clothing and inside them from entering the inside of the building, I do not know...",Eli

The movie is not bad, the acting is decent (the kid specially) the scares are pretty cliche (things appearing on mirrors or in very-often light crackles) and by the hour and ten you kinda have a good setup, but I think they missed the mark on how to end the story.

It's still confusing, but only because it was so bad. Not sure why the writers thought going that direction made it better. Why keep him in a bubble? Why lie? What actually were the first two treatments? Just. Bad. Acting was so subpar, I expected more from them. Really bummed to be honest, as we were hoping for a thrilling, unique take on the original Bubble Boy story.

189,SinisterTwist,"Decent scares, wish the conclusion was more built up (some spoilers)",7,18 October 2019,"Eli is a fair to middling horror flick that landed on Netflix during October. It was purportedly bounced around before the streaming giant was chosen, as the film company didn't really know what to do with it. After finishing the film I can honestly see why they were so uncertain.The film has some good scares and some nice jump scares, although I think they rely on them a bit too much for their own good. It's just that this movie can't really determine what it wants to be at times. Does it want to be a psychological thriller? A haunted house story? A devil movie? The answer to this is ultimately all three, with the third one tacked on at the end.The ultimate reveal that Eli is devil spawn and that the treatments were ultimately his parents and the doctor injecting him with holy water was a little out of left field, to be honest. I did wonder if there was a demon involved, however I was more expecting it to be Eli's gal pal Haley. Not that I was wrong about that necessarily. It's honestly a pretty interesting premise, that a child has been suffering all of his life because his parents were secretly slipping him holy water as medicine in order to keep him from becoming an antichrist-esque figure. I just wish that this was further explored a little more than it was, or at least the idea of the doctor being not exactly who she claimed to be investigated a little earlier.It would have been interesting to see Eli try to figure out how to worm information out of her without revealing exactly what he knows. More exploration in general could have been good, particularly where he goes and discovers old toys or whatnot left behind by the past patients, which show signs that something is not quite right there. Maybe have Eli be slightly more trusting of the doctor so that her character could be built up more, which would make the payoff that much more heartwrenching when Eli comes into his own and butchers everyone other than his mother. There was an attempt at this with his father, but it fell a little flat since there wasn't really enough foreshadowing about this.Even so, this was still a fun movie to watch and one that would make for some decent Halloween watch. A film doesn't have to be perfect or non-frustrating in order to be enjoyable enough to while away a couple of hours or so, after all. If you have Netflix and horror, I'd give it a shot.",Eli

Eli is taken on a final effort to cure him to a once abandoned manor in the middle of nowhere that has been taken over by a medical expert with a new type of method of treatment for curing patients with is particular disease. Escorted by his parents - played by the impeccable Kelly Reilly and Max Martini - he meets the sweet and loving Doctor Horn, portrayed by the brilliant Lili Taylor in her best acting gig in years.Everything seems fine at first, aside from the banging in the pipes and some unusual insects that hang around his window - that is, until is first treatment when Eli begins to see apparitions that threaten to do him arm. As usual when children see ghosts, no one believes him and he is given a choice by his parents to tough it out and take the treatments or to live forever with a condition that won't let him truly live.An appearance by the young and talented Sadie Sink ('Stranger Things') brings about the only 'friend' to Eli - a person he can clown around with and then later confide to.As it goes, there is much more to this hospital than meets the eye. Three children prior to Eli have undergone this treatment - none of which survived beyond the third procedure. Eli learns this and becomes adamant to leave, but his over-bearing father and his loving but worried mother prevent it. The spirits of the dead children begin to torment Eli... or are they trying to help him?Without giving more away, this film offers genuine scares and edge of your seat thrills that keep the viewer hooked from start to finish. There are a few 'huh' moments where we're not sure exactly what the mother knows and we wonder whose side she's really on. The ending is a shocker - one that some found to be out of left field but one that I feel genuinely adds to the story instead of taking away from it. The special effects team did an excellent and seamless job in this film, and CiarÃ¡n Foy took his time with the story, ensuring that everything we see and every scare that happens is done for the benefit of both the story and the viewer.

205,gtessarini,One good scary end among to many scary ends,8,27 October 2019,"A false witness will not go unpunished, and he who speaks lies shall perish. - Proverbs 19: 9. A phrase in a quick and unnoticed scene from the movie ""Eli"" which, when finalized, becomes very consistent with the course of the whole plot.
Eli is a movie divided between scenes of jump scares and suspicious innuendo that increases tension in a balanced yet striking way. With a main character suffering from a disease that affects his immune system giving him ""allergies to the world"" and whose parents are in an exhaustive search for treatments, the amount of scientific, psychological and religious subplots and variations applicable to this premise are diverse within of the horror genre and the movie itself.
What could be a failure in the development of the story is actually a very well-organized positive point in the production where subtle twists and turns that the film could take without being spoiled by its actual end chosen by the director.
The empathy and agony conveyed by the character's medical condition, well presented in Charlie Shotwell's acting, as well as his own terror experienced by the terrible figures he claims to see in the suspicious home where he performs his treatment, along with the coldness of the doctor played by Lili Taylor. , characteristic of the famous term ""monster doctor"" where science is so clear and superior to the needs of patients, form a sinister duality that is only increased and influenced by the suspense of Sadie Sink's own Stranger Things character, where we often wonder about the reality of his character in the world or just in the head of the sick boy, and the firm presence of his exhausted and conflicting parents who are incredulous about the macabre claims of his haunted son in the house where they are for treatment.
This whole ghostly scenario makes this psychological thriller with dozens of explanations take on a resolute form and with an ending perhaps even contemplated in one or two moments of the film, but surprising and well elaborated nonetheless. Eli is one of those films in which the plot twist can be considered very close to its end, but all the unfolding culminates in the balance between the increase of plots and suspensions and their filtering until the final moment arrives, taking away this terror. religion ""from the category of"" one more of those movies "".",Eli

212,tyler063097,Pathetic,2,20 October 2019,"The movie premise is somewhat interesting. But it feels like horror was randomly thrown in. The main character Eli is played by an awful kid actor. The only thing he did well at in this movie was scream. Otherwise his timing, and moments of ""being scary"" were very thrown off by his poor attempt. The kids parents were also annoying. A mother who you can't tell if she's good or bad. And a father who is the most typical ""I'm good, I'm bad"" type. He seems trustworthy in the beginning. But becomes evil in the end. And don't get me started on the ending. It was almost laughable. Especially the way it was executed. If you're into a deep story with great characters and a good ending.

Without giving up too much, it starts off as a reasonably creepy, although not quite scary, ghost story, then at some point someone decided to shift it into a demonic possession story. If it sounds odd, that's because it is.The setting is mysterious and isolated. The acting is sufficient, with Reilly and Shotwell putting in solid deliveries. The effects are well executed and not overly used. The ghost story portion of the plot goes well and kept me tuned in.Unfortunately, as I said, the final scenes takes all of that and turns it on its head. The effects remain solid and the acting is okay, but by that point the story has gone out the window.Overall, it's entertaining, but will quite possibly leave you wanting more towards resolving the grand questions.",Eli

226,ontariowarrior,Average Netflix horror movie.,6,21 April 2020,"First off, this movie started off interesting. It was the kinda horror movie where they do not really tell you what is wrong, you just watch the movie until it is revealed what is actually going on.
And when they reveal what is wrong with Eli, it is pretty stupid. Spoiler, he is the son of Satan and his illness was not really an illness, and his parents knew this.
With that being said, the movie relies heavily on jump scares and you not knowing what is even going on to keep the viewer interested, halfway in I wanted to stop watching but I also wanted to know what was even going on.
While not being the worse horror movie I have seen on Netflix (and there is some awful ones) Eli is still not very good and only worth your time if you really have nothing better to watch.",Eli

Netflix seems to be releasing some pretty good movies lately, but they have alot of catching up to do. They produce way too much rubbish.
Highly recommend, especially if you are into this genre and great timing for Halloween.I would give this a 9/10. I give it an 8/10 because its a deserved score overall. But if any cry babies give it a ridiculous score.
I'll come back and give it a 10/10.",Eli

Got kind of a spooky atmosphere, some scenes were truly frightening and it felt like the plot would turn some unexpected way... It did, but for the worse.I've seen many plot - twists throughout the movies, but never once so pointless like this one. It is literally built on NOTHING, based completely off the previous story, dialogue, characters or plot. It looks like as if director and the guys around suddenly come up with another idea for a movie, but didn't want to get rid of the previous material. Well done boys, you saved more of the film tape for the future generations.",Eli

Maybe not for the delicate ones, because couple people (actually it is the majority of the main cast) die and there is a tiny bit blood. I am sure every teen has seen worse in a haunted house. If you are a parent and want to pre-watch the murder scene, it starts at 1h25m ish.The acting is great, little Charlie's acted his heart out. The other actors were great too. But Charlie was the cutest.I loved that they showed the parents drifting apart through imagery. Cool and warm undertones to intensify the mood of the scenes. There is always some kind of symmetry in the background which made the movie really appealing to me.The plot is nothing new and the holy water injections therapy made me giggle.It was really enjoyable, even for an experienced horror fan like me.",Eli

The cast were wonderful, especially Lili Taylor as Dr. Horn and the title character played superbly by Charlie Shotwell. As with most horror you have to suspend belief but it never felt like a parody, hammed up, nor did it take itself too seriously. The direction was well done, with some fab jump scares, along with a growing sense of dread. It evoked similar feeling in me that I get from Rosemary's Baby.

It was his fear that made me so afraid!!I don't know why the rating is so low for this movie.

It was creepy enough to stay entertaining... but then the last 20 or so minutes completely ruined it! It felt like a last-ditch effort to make the movie unique.The fact that the kid is actually the literal son of the devil was stupid... the idea had no merit from the rest of the film and feels unrelated to the plot that was established in the first 3/4 of the movie. The kid just rides off with his half-sister and fellow spawn of Satan and it was a serious letdown!,Eli

There are very very few, subtle hints or foreshadowing on where it is going, but they ARE there, upon reflection when it's over.
Brilliantly written with excellent performances.
My only complaint was it didn't really fulfill it's potential; but then again, that should be explored in a sequel. But, if this indeed turns out to be a one-shot story, then what THIS story was, should've been condensed into 2 acts of a 3 act story that then explores what happens next during the 3rd act. (And yes, i'm sure other critiques would've went into the ""Explorers"" area where the 3rd act went off the rails after an intriguing setup during the first 2 acts, but, like I said, if there is no sequel, then that potential 3rd act would've been kinda cool.)

260,Sean_Friel,A unique watch that will leave you puzzled for days.,7,25 April 2020,"Netflix's new twist & turn horror attempt certainly leaves an impact.Eli (2019) is the story of a young boy with a rare auto immune disorder forcing him to live with life in protective gear isolated from the rest of the world. In an attempt to help his sons condition his parents take him to a facility where he then begins to encounter supernatural experiences.Eli is very different to that of popular horrors of the last few years. Films such as The Conjuring (2013) and Insidious (2010) perhaps offer more of a scare factor that will have you missing a few nights sleep but due to the quality of Eli's script you will be left in some what of a euphoric state.The films writers and its Irish director Ciaran Foy certainly drew inspiration from classic horrors such as The Exorcist series with many similar and contrasting themes.The cast is excellent with Stranger things Sadie Sink playing the role of the mysterious Hayley. A special mention must be in order for 12 year old Charlie Shotwell who played Eli as the lead. His performance was one far beyond his tender years, he's definitely one for the future.Criticism of the film would be that it almost feels that ends just as it begins to get going, which could perhaps mean the possibility of a future sequel. The film also leaves a few plot holes that can be left up to the interpretation of the viewer but ideally there needs to be explanation. As good as the concept is the filmmakers could have taken more care with its execution.A definite recommendation for any horror enthusiast or someone who wants a late night scare without causing a short term induced insomnia episode.",Eli

267,ccladue-968-316401,"""The Haunting"" meets ""The Exorcist"" meets ""Saturday Night Live""",3,19 October 2019,"This ""The Haunting"" formula (with the same actress, Lili Taylor) is watchable, even engaging and well-acted in parts, until the point where it completely falls apart during the unfathomably ludicrous ""The Exorcist"" parody (when we prepared to hear the boy start shouting in Linda Blair's voice). I almost thought the channel had changed and I was watching ""Saturday Night Live"" (which seems to be what some scenes were written for).The scenes with the parents inexplicably switching their opinions about the situation and swapping their personalities every minute not only takes me out of the movie but makes it seem like the editors fell asleep and pasted two different versions of the script together. Seriously, what were they doing? It's probably the most carelessly filmed content I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot of movies in my life. It makes it seem like that part of the movie was an overlooked series of errors until it continues in the last scene when it seems like an episode of ""Goosebumps."" Total incoherence rules the last fifteen minutes, when the child walks around and everything burns and falls apart in his path (just as in ""Stephanie,"" though which I thought was a much better movie).The father is for it and the mother grows wise and is then against it. No wait, the mother is for it and the father grows wise and is then against it. No wait...and so on. What in the world happened there? It completely loses any sense of continuity at that point, almost like randomly changing the channel between two different shows. Yes, I know there was revolving deception between them, but it still did not add up.Ultimately, I have to wonder if the movie was written and produced by the deranged trailer occupants near the beginning, who teased the boy in an extremely over-the-top scene. Were these people the writers? It sure seems that way by the end of the movie.With Lili Taylor's presence as the doctor, it also took me out of the movie and put me in another one, with virtually identical scenes (with her annoying daft character) from ""The Haunting."" I kept yelling ""Eleanor"" and ""Here comes Crain"" at the screen, especially with the scenes with the ghostly human form defined by the curtains as in ""The Haunting.""I have to wonder if people with the medical condition this movie bizarrely exploits in such a sick way were highly offended by it or saw it as unfathomably ridiculous as we did.Other movies with identical outcomes (kids walking along while everything burns or is destroyed on thought alone):Stephanie (2017), Shree Crooks was also in ""Captain Fantastic"" as is the ""Eli"" star (Charlie Shotwell), and this is hilarious in itself.Firestarter (1984)Carrie (1974)",Eli

What is advertised looking like a good haunted flick quickly takes a turn for the worse right at the end. Which for unsuspecting viewers is a cheap and unethical plot twist which spirals downward rapidly into a very evil and satantic cult like mess. The problem is, viewers have already committed their attention to an hour and fifteen minutes until the last 10 minutes turns ugly and comes out of nowhere. Don't waste your time with this one unless you like being cheated out of your precious movie viewing time. Nothing, and I mean nothing adds up from the first part of the story to what drivel mess it becomes in the end. It's a pathetic cheap shot with devil-child intentions that fall flat quicker and harder than Hillary passing out before being swept away by her security detail.

The main part of the plot, that Eli is basically allergic to the world, was interesting and made me philosophise a bit about allergies and fear.

The twist is so out of nowhere that ANY other twist would have been equally or even more reasonable; such as all the events turning out to be nothing but the dreams of a refrigerator tumbling down the stairs.

At the beginning you may think it will surprise you with new stuff, but nah.. after the first act you know what's about to happen because you've seen it several times in much better films. I would

Plus I have a weakness for anti-hero's. The (up until now) completely innocent kid triumphing over those who would kill him due to his birth circumstances is a fun twist that feels like a win/happy ending, considering we followed this poor terrified kid's perspective through the process of the plot unfolding.

Much like how all the later Paranormal Activities kept looping back to ending up at some house full of witches, the end just let down all the work to get it to that point. A shame, because if the story had proceeded the way we expected, this would've been a solid 8 or 9 as a horror movie. Instead it gets a middling 5; good setup, terrible ending.",Eli

Maybe it's a generational thing. I'm 50yso and not in desperate need of instant gratification however I find that most movies these days are formulaic and boring and I know how they will end by about 45 minutes at most.
The first act was weak and I nearly gave up on it but I didn't and by the third I was giving it my full attention. This ending is one I did not see coming until just a few minutes before the big reveal which came just minutes before the credits rolled.
I !WAS! disappointed when it was over but not because it was bad. I was disappointed because I wanted it to go on, which I'm absolutely positive it will. It's painfully obvious that there will be a sequel to this movie which i cannot wait to see.

299,DmytroBaker,A boy with an allergy to the world.,7,3 November 2019,"I will say right away that I was generally satisfied with the viewing. «Eli» is in some places an original mix from different genres, moreover, this is a film-changeling. At first it seems to be a drama flowing into a mystical thriller, the final chord of which ends with a real horror, but the unexpected outcome not only turns everything upside down and changes the emphasis of the narrative, but also leaves a pleasant aftertaste from what he saw.The main character, the boy Eli with zero immunity, spent his whole life behind a plastic cap (for some reason, I immediately remembered the funny comedy «Bubble Boy» with Gyllenhaal). Parents, in vain attempts to cure their son, bring him to a remote mansion to a specialist who practices such diseases. The mansion is a zone clean from microbes and isolated from the outside world. At first, the child succeeds in breathing to the fullest with the hope of a full life, but it's not as it seems at first glance. Almost immediately, he begins to feel an outside presence on himself and calmness develops into anxiety. This description of the plot will have to be limited, because further disclosure of details and even comparisons with similar films (after watching you yourself will understand which films are in question) will inevitably lead to undesirable spoilers.I can't say that the film is perfectly tailored, but the mystical part definitely turned out. Frightening moments are sometimes quite sudden and unusual, they reminded me of the first «The Conjuring». You definitely empathize with the main character, and this is a great merit of the young lyceum Charlie Shotwell, here he outplayed all the adults, very reliably conveyed the emotions and panic of his character.The technical side is on top, there is no conspicuous graphic. Many original finds, I liked the pun with the name of the protagonist. And the rapid final triple reprisal surprised, I have not seen this yet.But to the plot of the questions traditionally can not be avoided. Logical holes, especially after the whole picture has formed in the head, give rise to a lot of «why» and «how», but strangely enough they do not affect the impression very critically. Kieran Foy coped with the production well, unlike his previous work, the sequel to «Sinister», which turned out to be very mediocre.In general, «Eli» in my opinion turned out to be moderately fascinating and sometimes inventive horror, capable of both intriguing and surprising. Of course, the line could be drawn more freshly and severely to match the accelerated finale. But again I repeat, no regrets from watching.",Eli
300,seangomes,"The usual, mediocre Netflix fare.",4,19 October 2019,Nothing new or original here - just takes bits and pieces from better movies and mashes it together for a B-Movie that keeps the churn going on a streaming service.

304,logangard,"Interesting twists and turns, with a goofy finale.",6,2 November 2019,"Spoiler Free: So if you're looking for a movie that will entertain you, this is worth checking out. It has its element of horror and mystery. It's no masterpiece but it sure is a thrill ride. The characters give fair decent performances, and the way the story is paced doesn't drag on. However there are points in the film where some twists don't make sense. Give this one a go if you're looking for an interesting take on your ""paranormal activity"" type of movie.SPOILER TALK: So, as most other critics on the site can agree, the last ten or so minutes are beyond goofy. One critic said something along the lines of leaving the film at the scene where the doctors are performing the exorcism. The part of the film where the main character's eyes turn red made me chuckle. It's almost like a kid playing with action figures. The ending was meant to spectacular but it came off to me as more spontaneous. The boys acting is solid for the most part, and having him discover more as the film continues is one of the more interesting factors. Having him erupt like that and seem god-like was kind of out of place. I also forgot to mention the cheap, loud, and lazy jump scares. I think this movie had potential to be genuinely scary, but the jump scares took me out of the experience for the few scenes they happen in.",Eli

I saw so many websites -famous ones too - write about how scary it is and stuff so I was eager to see it. but I was really disappointed. Okay,I gotta admit,the concept was original, and I did get surprised by the plot twist - the part where he wasn't sick at all,and it was his parents behind it all along and that as fragile and vulnerable as he seemed,he was actually the one to fear - which is a good indicator. Still,it didn't present any new kind of horror,only the classical jump scares. and that ending!seriously!?he turns out to be the devil's son!!?I found that to be complete rubbish. and they didn't even bother make him look scary,they just put some red lenses on his eyes,and were like,you're good to go. I thought the ending was very lousy. As if no effort was put into it. And it was a bit confusing, cuz it was a lot of details to handle all at once. Had the movie not been marketed in the way it has been,and with such a trailer -it seemed so promising - I really would have tolerated its ending.",Eli

That's not to say Sadie Sink doesn't do a good job it's just that she doesn't play a big part in the film.The only real downside for me was some of the effects were a little poor and dare I say it cheep in appearance.All in all it's well worth a watch and be prepared for a twist ending that you may not see coming !,Eli

The actors are great, Lili Taylor is on of my all time favorite, she was in the Conjuring, Six Feet Under and The Haunting. great actress.

323,HorrorBrainShane,You've Seen This Already,4,7 January 2021,"This is one of those uber-generic, PG-13-style horror movies that usually get released in January/February, but apparently Paramount had so little faith in this film that they sold it off to Netflix and washed their hands of it. I can tell why.Eli is about a boy who has bizarre nightmares and seems to have a rare skin condition that flairs up when exposed to regular old air, Bubble Boy style. His parents take him to a creepy house where a weird doctor and a bunch of nuns say they can cure him, but of course things aren't what they seem, and creepy stuff starts happening.The biggest problem with the movie is the script, which is populated by old, tired tropes and horribly unlikable characters. there's also about 20 jump scares, with many of them being recycled spooks from earlier in the movie. Though it tries to eave some kind of real-world allegory, it's totally ruined by the left-field, cheesy ending. The actors try but don't have any good material to work with.Bear McCreary's score is good, and director Ciaran Foy does manage to give the setting its due from a visual standpoint, but everything else is boring, cheesy, or been-there-done-that. It takes ideas and tropes from countless other horror flicks and doesn't do any of it well, almost trying to do too much with what should be a simple premise.

Kelly Reilly came across very unnaturally and her over the edge performance stood out negatively.Eli's room did change between cuts within the same (!) scene, sometimes his bed would stand right next to the wall, the next moment in the middle of the room.

334,jclynn-34155,Amazing TWISTS & TURNS!,10,19 October 2019,"First I'd like to start by saying that when ppl give a movie all 10's, other ppl become sore losers and call foul. They'll begin to state that these 10 star reviews are fake. That's just sore losing & why can't anyone accept an opinion that's different from their own? I am very much real and a horror fan & this movie was AMAZING!
With so many other horror movies, we generally have the slow moving or stale beginning where all is (eventually) explained therefore we know what to expect and/or what and why will unfold. This movie does anything but that! You'll be led to believe you have a sense on what's going on but you're terribly mistaken! Nobody could guess this ending.
I loved the characters in this movie, wondering who I could trust & who the true ""villain"" was. Usually it's so easy to see but again, Netflix has restored our faith in horror. The scenes were frightening, the story was terrific, the acting genuine and stellar. But mostly, the twists and turns are what sets this movie above the rest.
Personally. I see the horror movie genre as having turned into ""teen screams."" Other movies seem to just add gore to cover up all of its flaws or silliness. This movie uses a great plot and doesn't have to resort to the repeated gore and smoke and mirror effects for shock value. Since the shock is in the plot and definitely the twists!
I give this movie a 10 star review. I highly recommended to any true horror fan who isn't watching a film for just the grit factor. This movie will really have you say ""I never saw that coming"" and on the edge of your seat wanting more! And isn't that what's so much fun about the world of horror, after all...",Eli

338,korsarebecca,The truth - An honest review from someone who thrives on horror movies.,1,12 May 2020,"-This review contains spoilers, but I recommend reading if you don't like disappointing movies.
This movie started with high potential to impress. We have a child with an auto-immune disease going to get treatment in an eerie atmosphered mansion. The ""doctor"" of this starts with what seems to be midieval or out-of-date treatment. Eli begins seeing ghosts and we get a haunted vibe.
Suspicion arises of her being the villain that tortures children. We are introduced to a red headed little girl who Eli sees outside. It is in question if she is the ghost of a girl who died here since she knows of a past kid named Perry. We have a practical horror movie plot rising and interest is still there, although it is very stretched out.
The whole movie crashes around the last 20 minutes or so when you begin constantly saying to yourself ""what?? Um what?"" My forehead still hurts from how long I was in a state of confusion. Eli ends up discovering a cage with what appears to be a well in it (you can assume has the dead children in it). His parents and ""the doctor"" nun find him and lock him in. The nun then says ""he knows"" and they walk away.
What does he know? She's a murderer? Why would his caring parents bring him here knowing she tortures the children? He then escapes and gets captured where they attempt to do his last treatment. Why is his dad okay with him dying? As the nun tries to kill him he gains the power to control her with his mind and makes her stab herself. He then becomes red with red eyes and burns the other nuns. He kills his father and spares his mother. When leaving he begins to have a normal appearance and finds the red headed girl outside. She then says how they have the same father, apparently all of the children brought here did, Satan.
From a sick child to ghosts to the child of Satan. This movie is a true disappointment to ALL HORROR MOVIES. I HATE predictable plots, but I'm also not a fan of irrelevant ones. Netflix has had some good originals, but this IS NOT ONE. Horror movies don't seem to be their thing.",Eli
339,allandp,Not perfect but much better than soo many other,7,6 November 2019,"Underrated at the time of writing (5.8/10)I like suspenseful, creative movies and this one was a surprisingly positive experience. I'm not saying it's perfect but it stays consistent throughout and things which was seemingly odd or out of place actually turned out to make sense.I won't spoil your experience, so I will avoid driving into the specifics, but do know that the ending might feel like somewhat unhinged. Personally, I felt it could have been dialled down a bit for a more impactful finale, but all in all it actually works quite well and ties everything together... And to be honest, what more could you ask for from a 1:30-ish movie? (a length I greatly appreciate for casual movie watching)BTW, I found it very effective and beautifully crafted. I was surprised more than once and i Did Not see that ending coming.Well done. Well played.",Eli

341,gabriellkramer,Too Sloppy,4,20 October 2019,"I'm not one too catch a lot of inconsistencies, but I just couldn't keep from seeing them here. From like the first 10 minutes on.A kid throws a beer bottle that busts on the back of the family car window as they drive off, and the wide shot showing them drive off the window is clean. The girl throwing rocks at his window at the treatment center to get his attention, pebbles by the sound of it, but each one puts a small crack in the window.The boy gets drilled into the bone of his leg, while he is still conscious- then he is walking and even nearly running afterward. He gets the back of his head shaved and gets drilled into it, but a few scenes later and there's no shave spot in the back of his head.When he talks to the girl through the heavy glass room, somehow they hear each other pretty loud and clear where it would really be muffled. And there were more and more problems.The whole thing to me just felt thrown together and not well thought out. Like they carelessly ran through the first two acts to get to the final act, which was a crazy twist. Maybe the end gives a pass to most of the issues I just listed, but it feels more like sloppy and rushed film-making.Not a great movie by any of the stretch. Maybe it isn't even trying to be. Is it worth watching? After what I saw, I don't think so. My vote would be to find a better one.",Eli

343,RedLion2074,Enjoyable movie with a very interesting ending twist,7,19 October 2019,"I was really hooked by the Eli's trailer and I was waiting for this one. And it wasn't a disappointment.Firstly, the plot is great ! It really leaves you to want more, trying to decode the mystery revolving around Eli, his illness, and the ""clinic"" where he is treated. And more importantly, it surprisingly manages to let you still wonder what the heck is going on until the ending twist, even when some keys elements are unveiled. Nicely done !Secondly, the actors are OK in their roles. No outstanding performance, but there is no disturbing false note either. It's still a bit pity you won't feel that empathetic for Eli and/or his parents. Also, for the role she plays, you can feel it was a cakewalk for Sadie Sink coming from ""Stranger Things"". On this part, it could have been a little better.The ambiance mixes supernatural and thriller with a bit of horror elements. And for once, some supernatural elements can be explained ""logically"" ! Kudos for that ! However, the movie is a bit slow paced and you'll have sometimes the feeling they tried to make it artificially longer.To summarize, ""Eli"" is entertaining enough to enjoy the ride and has even enough material for a sequel. Give it a chance ! It deserves it.",Eli

The acting was great by the whole cast. Some new ideas for jump scares were great as well. The special effects were clean and stunning too. The pace of the movie was not boring at all.Of course, it could add something new or more interesting to it, but I'm satisfied with its simplicity with something crazy here and there.I often find that people who hate this kind of movies will rarely give good scores in the horror genre.

There are plenty of themes here which have been done before, but they are all blending and mixed together to make a pretty unique experience, culminating in an ending I did not anticipate.

I really like this movie, I recall my mum being a little unimpressed with the story/ending, but I didn't have my hopes overly high at the time (it has a Netflix movie, after all) and was actually pleasantly surprised. I was however, a little dubious of where the plot was ending up in the very last scenes, and think perhaps it should have ended sooner before it went a little OTT with the whole Satan's spawn thing and there were a couple of cringey moments with the kids there. Other than that, I really enjoyed it and it was quite creepy, though not terrifying.",Eli

Good thing nowadays I try to go into movies without knowing to much about them so I rely heavily on movie ratings and my own senses which doesn't always end up good but when it works it works wonders.. Eli overall is a decent horror flick which ended in a manner that opened the door wide for a sequel that could be miles better than the 1st one mainly because of the smart idea it conceals.. I only hoped that they wouldve executed it much better for the idea itself and the premise allows for so much more twists and turns without ruining the ultimate surprise... I liked it enough that I it made me write this short comment for other users to go and explore it themselves but go on with modest expect! Tions and you'll be served just fine?,Eli
354,Carro101,Pointless ghost and ending,2,24 October 2019,The ghosts seemed pointless in the story obviously they were trying to help him but it was so aggressive (obvs just for scare factor) it was a very strange plot. Also if he was the spawn of saran why did ghosts even scare him n why did he not flame up when scared or running away? The ending ruined the entire film was just weird and irrelevant.,Eli

You get to a point of total confusion from the twist in the end though. it just completely turned around.I was hoping the ghosts would save him. I don't have any other answers for his ""illness"" being cured. But it was all supernatural to start with. Could've been better with the ghosts saving him and his mother.The only thing the ending explains is the burns he kept getting, his angry father with his mother in the implications she cheated, and of course the religious factor in the end.Over all it had me watch it all the way through so it wasn't bad.",Eli

Hoping for a good scare, I watched this TV-MA production on Halloween but was ultimately disappointed. It starts exciting but turns dull after literally ten minutes.

Save your time and watch something else.",Eli
364,MetalNickA,Good concept but poorly executed,5,19 October 2019,"I saw the trailer on Netflix about 2 weeks before it came out, and thought it seemed cool. A horror movie about a kid with some ""strange illness"" seeking unorthodox treatment, but the place is haunted and he gets terrorized by ghosts. At least that's what you're led to believe.I didn't think it was slow, I felt the pace was appropriate. It doesn't take long before all the freaky stuff happens. There are some jumps that are obnoxiously loud. And then there's that weird girl outside who is oddly low-key obsessed with him.The last like 10 minutes of the movie is when it hits the fan, and you find out what's actually going on. And it's not what you think, at all. Spoiler: he isn't sick, and at first it appears he is possessed and the final stage of his ""treatment"" appears to be an exorcism. When this happened I was genuinely surprised, and honestly they could've left it at that and it would've made a great movie, but then they took a step further; he isn't just possessed, he is literally a spawn of satan. Now it's just ridiculous. And then it turns out the girl is also a spawn of satan and they ride off into the night, the end.It would've been a fantastic movie if they didn't take it that extra step. I thought they were going for a ""demonic possession from the victim's perspective"" kind of deal, but no. It's a shame because that would've made a much better movie.Good acting from the kid and Sadie.",Eli

366,JoaTomGar,Poor boy Eli didn't even need treatment in the first place!,3,21 October 2019,"The whole reason for the story is full of plot holes. We learn in the last act of the movie that Eli isn't sick after all. He doesn't have a immunity disease. He doesn't seem to suffer from the fact that he's Satan's son either (lol, that plot in this movie is almost ridiculously funny, not scary), which we see in the end of the movie when he sits down in the car. He's fine.
So if his parents would've let him grow up like any healthy kid (instead of lying to him that he has a immune disease) he would never have had to go through the horrible treatments in the facility. He would've been spared so much suffering! The only reason Eli goes berserk in the final act is because he's afraid and angry, and he takes it out on the persons that have scared him. I'd say it's a valid reaction.
So the hole plot for the movie is basically useless. Besides that the acting is pretty good. The scary parts aren't super scary but the ghosts are pretty well done I think.",Eli
367,toenailzits,Best Horror movie I have seen in a long time,7,18 October 2019,"Wow this defied my expectations. When I saw the trailer for it I knew I wanted to watch it but I was not expecting it too be more than just entertaining. But this was far better than what I had thought it would be. I had low expectations because when they did the sick kid, bad doctor story I would have watched it because I love human rights stories but when they added demons as part of the story I had my fears that they where just adding too much and it was going to weaken the story. You that movie that tries to be a jack of all trades master of none because it can not figure out exactly what it wants to be. Well this is not the case for this movie it handles itself and all the different horror elements beautifully. It is a well told story that is perfect for this Halloween month. Truly one of the best horror movies I have seen in a long, long time.
The only downside is I kind of knew the twists that where coming not all of them but what I guessed was going to happen happened. Even though that was the case I really enjoyed the movie and I doubt you will find a better told horror story this Halloween.",Eli

It's competent through to the end, where it straddles the line between originality and goofiness. But even this was done well enough to where I chose to look past the goofiness.While the setting of an old house is standard horror fare, the set up, not to mention the good child acting, are not. Eli is not high-culture horror. It's a good old fashioned horror movie done in a unique way.

Not the scariest horror movie but what is scary these days to a hardcore horror fan? The movie keeps you guessing all the way through and then has an ending which will take you by surprise.

Without providing spoilers, it has the ingredients viewers would require for a watchable movie experience.The main character considers his life to be horrible, due to being unable to enjoy life like everyone else. He finds himself living his existence like bacteria in a Petri dish. For those who remember, he is much like bubble boy, without the comedic adventure.However, after arriving at a ""Clean House"", where a certain doctor is supposed to be able to cure him of his physiological affliction, Eli soon finds himself experiencing a more supernatural level of drama.The story continues with Eli discovering more than he was expecting of the Doctor by his interaction with a visitor outside the house. In addition, the therapy he receives appears to be doing little to alleviate his condition.

For me horror movie nowadays has too much jumpscare that didnt have great story at all.

441,taggedinblue,An entertaining but highly incompetent horror movie,6,2 November 2019,"The reason I watched this was because I've heard of rumors about people who are ""haunted by demons"" after watching this so I jumped the bandwagon with nothing but sheer excitement to tear this movie apart in disappointment, knowing that it would be godawful. But... as bad as this movie is, I kinda like it. I can't say that I was bored while watching it, which is weird and unexpected.As a horror movie this thing is complete bad. I'm no tough guy when it comes to the genre and I had plenty nights that I haven't been able to sleep because of certain movies, and with that said this movie completely failed to evoke me any of that sensation whatsoever. Trust me, if you're aware of the stereotypical fake-out jumpscare (build tension, cut tension with false security, silence, actual scare) this movie will not even remotely scare you. And it doesn't end on a good note either, typically for a horror movie the final moments are the most memorable part that sticks with you and leaves you scared for days, but with this one I highly doubt you'll end up scared for longer than the actual time spent watching it.So, it's a bad horror movie, but I still like it. Here's what I liked about it, take it as a good or a bad thing if you will.To start off the main protagonist is fine, for a kid actor I expected far worse but in reality he's kinda good... for the most part. He plays as an investigative skeptical young boy who's scared for his life and wants to find a cure to his weird illness, and I think that part is pretty convincing. I liked it. On the second half of the movie there's a bit of a ""shift"" however, to which at that point he... didn't do so well. The kid tried his best but it just ended up funny and I was chuckling all the way through.The plot isn't actually that complex, you can tell everyone's roles in it quite easily, but it's certain details about it that I was particularly curious of and it kept me interested throughout, I liked the whole premise of it as well. There are pieces of information I didn't figure out until the end, which surprised me because I was hyper focused on solving the mystery before the movie would eventually directly tell me (and the movie does that a lot, in case you really don't get it). There's a plot twist at the end of the third act and trust me, when I said that this movie doesn't end on a good note I really meant it. It gets so ridiculous and so stupid I was amazed. I was smiling at how unintentionally comical it ended up being. Without giving spoilers, let's just say it turns edgy, the cringe kind of edgy.So yeah, I was very amused, it's kind of a bad movie but I can't be too harsh on it with just how entertained I was. If you want to watch a horror movie though this is just about the last one on my list that I would recommend, so just keep that in mind if you plan on watching it.",Eli

Turns out he is the devils son, the ghosts were other children of the devil who had been brought to these nuns to be either saved or killed. (Once the nuns realize it's more than just possession they decide to free the souls by killing them). Kid figures it out and escapes, and goes to hell with his sister after murdering the nuns.For people to say that doesn't make ANY sense or that it is COMPLETELY off the wall and unrelated seems like they just didn't take the time to put all the pieces together.It's far from the greatest writing or plot twist I have ever seen or read but I think some of the reviews are being pretty harsh to a Netflix original movie.",Eli

454,Mewvies,Bubble Boy with ghosts!!!,3,22 October 2019,"The main character is suffering from an autoimmune disease, who travels with his family to find a miricle cure for his condition. Once Eli begins his treatment, the side effects take a supernatural turn. Once the plot takes off the movie takes a mystery box aproach to story telling which can work in a series format but doesn't work for the films 90 minute run time. Non of the actions of any of the characters seem to make any sense other than to confuse the viewer. Obviously I didn't like this movie, and I don't recommend watching but if you have Netflix any way why not, you may get some enjoyment as a so bad its good film.
SPOILERS PAST THIS POINT!!!!
once Eli begins his treatment he experiences visions of ghosts, but the ghosts motivations don't make any sense they have no goal. From the beginning it is painfully obvious that they are trying to warn Eli that he is in danger, but they at some points want him to leave and at others want him to uncover the mystery, later they are completely gone from the movie. it turns out that Eli is a child of the devil which I honestly didn't see coming but by the end I didn't care that I had an answer as to why things were happening. In terms of the film creating questions to answer or not answer later on in the film I could go on and on, one that sticks out to me is towards the end of the film for no apparent reason the family car parked outside the house bursts into flames, its later implied that Elis half sister is the one who does this but its not clear why. the biggest problem with this movie is that its not scary or suspenseful. the scenes where there are ghosts I can see how they would be scary but there are no actions taken to make the scenes scary the scenes are all to bright and you can see where and when ghosts will appear. the scenes where the ghosts torment Eli came off more as an annoyance than something to be feared or dread. The camera work is sloppy and lacks style. one scene I thought was going to be good was when Eli has discovered the conspiracy in the basement of the house, he blacks out thinking he is going to die but wakes up the camera follows Elis breathing zooming in when he inhales then falling back when he breathes out, but before I could appreciate this the camera shakily zooms in again and stays there.",Eli

Eli really keeps you on the edge and has you guessing what the heck is going on from scene to scene. I wasn't expecting the ending at all and didn't come apparent until the last 20 minutes or so as to what was truly going on. It is absolutely worth the watch if you are the type of person who doesn't have to analyze every word and step a character makes in a movie!

The twist was unexpected and explained most of the loop holes we rolled our eyes at (but not the vanishing beer on the glass - at least, I don't think it did?), but I felt like the last few minutes dumbed the movie down a little.

Like the director didn't really do his homework and nothing really happens ""naturally"". They might as well be holding their scripts on screen and it wouldn't make a difference.

But the last quarter of the movie throws the entire plot (literally) into the fire.

Screenwriting 101: if their audience have no clue what is actually AT STAKE when you go into your third act they are just not going to care about bloody showdowns and forced plot twists. The ending was a bit like me lying hungover and jet lagged in a hotel room in Tokyo zapping the TV and some some Sumo wrestling comes on. Sure, I can *see* that one guy pushes another guy out of the ring but I do not know who the wrestlers are and I have no idea what the match was about (a friendly or the world Sumo title) I cannot *care*.",Eli

If you enjoy torturing yourself give it a watch I suppose.",Eli
487,infen,That ending though,4,28 October 2019,"It was, as most of us says, a good horror movie until the end... The end sucked big time and made the movie look ridicules and ruined it.I loved the haunted house idea and the thought of him either beeing haunted himself or the building he is kept in. Maybe the producers just didnt want that good old ending, but some times a sub genre is a sub genre... not a bad remix.",Eli
488,psycho_1010,A good build-up entering into the wrong door of potential plot-twists.,6,20 October 2019,"Like seriously. It had a very good build-up. I really enjoyed the way it portrayed the everyday suffering of a boy living with a special condition. The burden that the parents have to carry. The mixed emotions of theirs. At some point I almost forgot it is a horror movie, it was dressed like a drama. 8/10
The mid part is also okey, dwelling into the mysteries of the story. There are parts where you cannot know what is real and what is not, which just adds to the tense. Still 8/10.
But that plot-twist in the end? Well, well... 4/10 and I was merciful. You know those clichés when you are in a hallway and you have to decide which door you enter, without knowing what's behind? So you have to guess which one to pick. Something similar might have happened with the creators. They built up a nice story, and like 'okey, here we are, now how do we end this? This way? That way? Naaa whatever, let's just do this one.'
Turned out to be the wrong one. Too far-fetched in the shadow of the a priori storyline.
To sum up: if you subtract the last 15 or 20 minutes or so, it's a pretty good movie. But the endig just ruins it sadly.",Eli

There wasn't a single hint in the entire movie of a possession or something else. It was a really forced ending.It seems to me that they ran out of ideas and had a cutting close deadline, so they made something up.

493,chris-2724,Very Good,8,28 October 2019,I have a different opinion of this film than some. I found the first 2/3rds of it to be your standard Horror/Ghost show - not bad but not great. It took off for me in the final 3rd of the film with a solid twist that I was not expecting. This is exactly the type of film we need today - one that does not follow the same old and tired story lines. For the medium it is a solid 7 or 8 out of 10; I went with the latter as the movie took a risk and I feel it worked and put the whole story into proper focus.,Eli

So, this kid is really sick, and then he is taken to a ''clean house'' to get treatments for his sickness. He starts seeing ghosts, which scare him at first but then we wind out that they're actually trying to help him.
Eli finds out that the doctor is actually trying to kill him, but then he finds out that he was actually never sick.
That part was good. But then we find out that he's spawn of satan or something? So he kills literally everyone exept his mom and then he and his new friend, who apparantly also is a demon or something make their mom drive them somewhere. The end. WTF?
At first, the movie seemed somewhat realistic, and then stuff hits the fan, and not in a good way. It was just a bit ridiculous.",Eli

Keeps attention well enough but is both boring and too fast. Theres just not enough anything in any direction to make it more than average and the writing drip feeds material, most of which hints at greater ideas that just dont matter to the plot.

Eli gets to find out that, not only is his dad satan but also he's got super sweet satan powers? C'mon that's dope!...and if you side with the Nuns, you're wrong on this one and you suck. Did he go a little overboard with the burning alive thing? Sure, but these dudes were trying to kill him. That was self defense. What would you do?

520,misotheismgodhatesall,Reviewers who didn't enjoy twist (actually 2 twists); were either not paying attention and/or have a biased view,10,19 October 2019,"Actual rating 8/10. Trying to bump it up due to overwhelming reviews by people offended by the ending due to personal beliefs, but saying they didn't like it, and trying to poke holes in an otherwise great movie. Also should only have an MA rating at most, don't know how it earnt an R rating.
The ending may have been a little corny at times, but is justified and overshadowed by the epic surprise of the plot turns and twists, (yes if you pay attention there are two, maybe three, but definitely two 'oh they're going that way now' twists).Spoilers; evil triumphs over good in this one, even though it looked like it wouldn't.
Great acting, very tense and suspenseful throughout, some of the jump scares got me even when I saw them coming. And even the medical bits are pretty tense, guessing most reviewers unaware of pain involved in some of the procedures shown, where little or no anaesthetic can be used. Loved the somewhat unexpected but satisfying ending (some reviewers calling it unrealistic, but, um the ghosts throughout the movie are ok?). I enjoyed all the clues scattered throughout pointing to something being off, but intentionally vague to keep you guessing, or just giving up and waiting to see where it's going.
A bit of a modern and original take on exorcism, (not the movie, but the practice). It looked like it would just be a sacrifice ritual, then turns into a failed exorcism, so they decide to save the soul by killing the boy, but then that doesn't go to plan, turns out it's not a typical possession, the devil spawn kicks some epic.
An enjoyable watch, and an awesome ending.",Eli
521,xpateoi,Very wtf,5,19 October 2019,"If netflix would allow us to change the speed of the movie, it would've been great. I was skipping a lot because the ""scary"" parts are just jump scares, also there are a lot of long walks and parts that, if you advance 10 seconds, you don't miss anything. The plot is ok, acting was good, but the ending, although was unexpected, was satisfying cause the movie didn't bother explaining certain circumstances.

522,demonguy-55294,Well worth the watch,8,20 October 2019,"Netflix has habit of churning out unnecessary content in order to populate the platform and keep users subscribed. It's both impossible and unfair to expect every movie/series to perform well, but I can't believe some of the projects that Netflix signs off on. Who is approving this stuff?! That being said, Eli was a unique case where a potentially terrible premise was treated with a careful and deft hand that successfully saved it from becoming a farce. The film is well-paced, the performances are strong without being over-bearing and you feel like you've spent your time fruitfully once you reach the conclusion. Unlike many horror/thriller films which receive sequels, Eli has established an actual base upon which a sequel or series of sequels can be built (I'm looking at you 'The Conjuring') and can be considered a self-contained story even if it does not receive one. Altogether the film feels like time well spent and is free from a lot of the negative tropes seen in horror.",Eli

I didn't know how gullible I really felt until I saw the whole purpose of what happened to the little boy. The monsters were incredulously creepy, suspense was substantially a little high, and the plot was really really good. I'll watch it again this time in Halloween. But all in all, this movie is so far my second favorite. Keep up the good work!! I'd definitely recommend for all the inexperienced horror viewers to watch this movie. But bring your rosary!",Eli

Unfortunately halfway to 3/4's through when the movie starts to build up to the big reveal, it throws it all away.

530,caitlinhanna,Several Good Ideas That Don't Mesh,4,1 November 2019,"""Eli"" is a 2019 Netflix horror movie that in its attempt to be mysterious ended up just being downright confusing. Throughout the film it attempts to keep the viewer on their toes, making it very obvious from the get go that not all is as it seems, but in order to maintain the surprise of the twist ending throws out a number of red herrings and the eventual twist comes so far out of left field that there is no reason to suspect it, so it comes across as disjointed and confusing. It also ends up destroying its continuity. Beyond a few instances of ""It doesn't work like that,"" at one point in the climax the mother character tells Eli ""X happens because of Y,"" however in one of the first scenes of the film ""X"" happens without ""Y"" occurring. Otherwise, the acting is pretty good, with a surprisingly good performance by the child actor (until the twist, where he portrays the confusion and anger that the audience is feeling).
Overall, the movie presents several good ideas that could have made two or three decent films, but when put all together it comes across as a confusing mess.",Eli
531,sgtkermit,Time for horror to die,2,1 November 2019,"I'm sorry but the moment I realised this was a God Vs Satan battle I immediately lost interest. You can only truly scare people with a premise that could hold some potential of truth - suspension of disbelief. We live in a generation where religious belief is thankfully being left in the past and so most people under 30 will not connect with the idea of demons and angels, God and Satan. A bunch of nuns trying to save possessed kids in an inexplicably expensive, hermetically sealed, medically outfitted mansion. There that's the whole story. It's really great.Apart from obvious on camera inconsistencies, why is there virtually no security at a location where literal spawns of Satan are being held and excised? Just a few goofy nuns. It really makes no sense.I found the 'twist' to be laborious and insulting. Take away the advanced medical equipment and the 'oh my God he's not actually sick' twist and we're left with a generic possession flick with really bad acting. An area of the movie world already far too saturated.Please stop making this GARBAGE, Or at least put a warning on the title screen. Something to the effect of 'IQ of 50 or less. Contains religious nonsense.'.",Eli

It was enjoyable and interesting, but the last half of the film is garbage. As soon as Eli goes to Dr. Horn's worship dungeon, the movie rapidly declines. An 80 to a 0 real quick.The film was horror in the beginning, using no drastic jump scares and great visuals. The theme was interesting and I was excited to see where the film went. I was excited to figure out what the twist was going to be and what was really happening to Eli. I felt sorry for this kid and his mother. He just wanted to be a normal kid and she just wanted him to have a normal life. Eli being a smart kid, realizes something weird is happening, being haunted by ghosts, Dr. Horn being shady, and his father acting weird. We as the audience could infer that from the beginning something was off (the genre and similar movies) and Eli confirms our suspicions when he reads Dr. Horn has killed all of her patients. Decent movie up until this point.My problem with this film is the twist has been played out a thousand times and was done horribly. It's like the writers couldn't think up an ending and picked an ending out of a hat. Eli being a son of Satan was... really? Seriously? That's the best you could come up with? I cannot believe this was what they came up at the writers table and thought it would be a good ending. It's like they tried to be Shutter Island and Session 9, which both had similar themes and one large mystery throughout the film. The film was decent but ruined with the ending
The ending always makes the movie, having a good first and second act does not make up for an awful ending. There is so much that could have been done with this movie and it's premise. The ending was lazy, boring, and over done.I'm so sick of horror movies ending up like this.",Eli

546,gat-48317,Surprisingly Good!!,10,11 August 2020,Okay yes. Its not a high budget film. But honestly it left me wanting more! What stuff do they have to do? What will they do? Where are they going? How are they using their powers? Good or evil? I mean he didn't kill his mom. So I don't think he's all bad. I really hope they come out with a second one tbh. The story had me guessing all the way to end!! Seriously! Very very cool! Idk why it has such a bad rating on here. Very highly recommend giving it a try!!!!,Eli

550,bethemeat,Good Movie With a Troubled Ending,7,20 December 2020,"Firstly, to go over the objective good parts of this movie, it's very well made. Acting, effects, and cinematography are great. The story is intriguing and makes the viewer want to know what will happen next. Most negative reviews of this movie cite the ending as being a letdown. I definitely I understand how one could come to that conclusion. Questions circle around the actual end goals of many characters, so when they are revealed it seems somewhat arbitrary. My biggest piece of advice for watching this movie is to pay close attention. There are a lot of hints relevant to the ending in set design and dialogue. Without them it feels like a very hollow ending, with them it is more satisfactory.",Eli

I'll admit that I enjoyed around the first 40 minutes but that all went down hill really fast once we got into the second act.
Holy water injections, infertile women making pregnancy pacts with the devil (""Oh well, Lucifer promised me that if he could inseminate me then his demon seed wouldn't grow up to be evil like dear old dad""...ummm ?!), and failed labotomies that seemingly have zero effect on a little boy whose supposed to be doped up on holy water, its like the creator's decided to take every cliched possession idea and go ""Ehhh..sure why not"".
The acting was fairly good throughput the 1st portion but it quickly became super laughable. The little boy who played Eli went a bit too overboard when he channeled his inner demon and both the script and acting just became all levels of cringe.
I would skip this one unless you are rather partial to see the downward spiral for yourself.",Eli

It didn't dawn on me until the end that this was a nod in that direction with the mom being named Rose. Not very scary but I don't scare easily.

For the first half of the movie we made fun, per usual, but then the real story started to take form...

This is a horror film, guys, that's the kind of thing that happens!The ending then explains the previous events, eg: Eli's ""dad"" yelled ""How dare I?! After what YOU did?!"" at his wife, he was talking about the time she cheated on him with the literal devil.(I saw there was a bible quote, 3:17, but didn't catch the book. Was it book of Samuel: ""What was it he said to you?"" Eli asked. ""Do not hide it from me. May God deal with you, be it ever so severely, if you hide from me anything he told you."")Yes, I know we were all rooting for the boy, but sometimes good becomes bad.And, BTW, other criticisms are easily explained:""Those trailer guys who made fun of Eli and his hazmat suit. Honestly, I wish he killed them."" - His inner devil was not revealed to him yet.""Remember when Eli had no reaction to being sliced open with a scalpel?""
His inner devil was not revealed to him yet.The fact that Eli is a demon but sucks so hard at magic tricks.
His inner devil was not revealed to him yet. This just shows he was an innocent up until then.""When Eli levitated the doctor and nurses, hung them upside down, then set them on fire.""

But that last part... oh, that last part... it just ruined everything.Not only did it leave you wondering what the heck just happened (and not in a good way). It left many really, really good elements without development or closure, and it threw in a bunch of random new elements that the movie developers just expect you to take in all of a sudden.Additionally, there were many inconsistencies in the film, even in the good parts.I wouldn't call it a twist.

My issue with the movie is that it made no sense and didn't tie anything together. It could have been so much more which is disappointing.
Did the parents and staff worship god or the devil? Eli is the son of the devil so one would assume the later. So why do a exorcism? If that's what it was. And why would the family sell everything they have to take Eli to a clinic that was unknown to them if they were all part of the one cult? We're the ghosts for or against Eli?
Too many holes in the story for me.",Eli

Initially the plot was very interesting, a young boy with an autoimmune disease that makes him allergic to the world getting treatment from an untrustworthy doctor in a creepy house.However, the last quarter of the movie was a stupendous blunder in which the writers and directors fumbled their once enticing plot with extremely lazy writing. I mean the son of the devil? Really??? The devil is so famous he could have any chick so why did he choose Eli's mum specifically to be the mother of his child?Poor story poor acting (especially from Eli's mum) and a breathtakingly bad ending.

Okay, the first part of the movie was decent, we follow a couple with a really sick kid, they're on their way to a medical facility where a cure is supposed to be. They arrive to this enourmous house, which is sealed from the outside for maximum security to their fragile pacients. Here we meet Dr. Horn. Long story short they start performing this procedures on Eli, hoping he will get better but he doesn't, he just keeps gerring worse and he starts seeing ghosts, he brefiends this weird girl that's always outside of the house
In his paranoic state he decides to look for the truth and he discovers that dr horn killed her previous patients, he tries to warn his parents so they can get out of there and from here is where everything goes into pieces
Eli ends up in a basement, where there's an altar and a well in the middle, he discovers he's not sick after all cause he's breating this dusty air and he's still alive
Long story short... It turns out Eli wasn't sick all along, he was POSSESED, yeah... this twist is crap... we end up having a possesed child burning alive everyone and taking his ""mother"" with him
Remember that weird girl he was friends with, well, she's possesed too....

I cannot believe that the creators of a great thrilling show like The Haunting of Hillhouse made this, with the terrible cgi, acting and storyline. It was a horror movie, because it was a mix between 5 different movies and made me wonder when it would end and my suffering as well. Other than that, they relied on jump scares and basic horror movie stunts, full of a million plot holes as well.

Right off the bat, it is pretty intense and it leaves you curious enough to see what is going on. So, they really try to sell you on pity for Eli, which I get, I mean I couldn't imagine how horrible it would be having to spend my days in a HAZMAT suit. It doesn't look scary yet, although they have introduced some horror tropes such as creepy kid on a swing, and driving through mist.It definitely sets the tone for suspense and thriller so far, and I think I've seen less than an hour. I already get the feeling this is going to be more psychological than jump scare. So far this is the most interesting thriller I have seen in some time, I am starting to care less about the doctor and her nurses, all of whom are creepy and weird, but I genuinely care about Eli and his family. The director did a good job of building sympathy with the main character, and making us feel sorry for him I think.Watching it all the way to the end was actually a real treat. It has been so long since I've found a decent horror/thriller. This movie takes a really cool take on the classic Devil's Seed idea and makes it something wholly original. I'm really impressed with it.",Eli

Ive spent the last 16 years critiquing horror movies, and endulging in my obsession. But its very hard to impress me now. To creep me out or to wow me. I stumble upon some that i might recommend or that i would watch again. I have favourites and some of them have even come out in the last 2 years. But it is still incredibly rare to find a horror movie that shocks me. Eli shocked the hell out of me.
Its like someone took the general setting for Bubble Boy and made it into a sinister horror movie with creepy ghosts, twists and turns and constant questions. The acting is amazing on all roles and the idea takes a classic premise and puts an insane twist on it.
I have no idea why this movie is getting such poor ratings. Ive never left a review on a movie on before but i had to for this one.
