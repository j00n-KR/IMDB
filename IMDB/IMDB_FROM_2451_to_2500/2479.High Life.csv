0,SnoopyStyle,character study,5,20 January 2020,"This takes place in outer space. This starts with Monte (Robert Pattinson) and a baby girl seemingly the only survivors on a spaceship. The crew turns out to be prisoners on a suicide mission to investigate a nearby black hole. Dibs (Juliette Binoche) is the doctor.This is trying to be a character study more than a sci-fi adventure. Nevertheless, I am struck by the illogical premise. They don't do anything that couldn't be done better with probes and machines. Any reasonable mission would be an unmanned mission. No matter what crazy happening occurs in the story. The unreasonableness of the story stays in the back of my mind. And there is a lot of crazy. The craziest being the box. This movie is definitely going for the home runs. I appreciate the home run swings but it's mostly a miss for me.",High Life
1,nogodnomasters,Another Black Hole film,4,18 July 2019,"If you have ever seen a black hole film before, you know how it ends, in that you don't know how it ends. Someone has figured out the Earth is dying and use the highly intellectual death row prisoners to perform deep space probes as project ""Second Chance."" They are traveling near the speed of light. Their mission is to see if they can capture a black hole's rotating energy. Not my first choice of a glory mission. The film opens with everyone dead except for Robert Patterson and an infant. It flashes back.This appears to be some alternative Earth and spaceship limit by 1950's special effects.Guide: F-word, sex/rape, nudity (Juliette Binoche, Mia Goth)",High Life
2,kosmasp,Life up high,8,14 June 2020,"Or is it high on life? Well who isn't right? Even when you are a criminal or maybe even more so, because you value certain things more (I would think). The movie starts off in the future (though no time is given really), where a lot of things have already happened. I won't go into them, but you will be aware of where things end up and therefor it is not like too much of a guessing game where we go. I would even argue that the end (as ""open"" as it may seem) is something you can see .. coming - no pun intended.Good acting, quite interesting set up and a lot of dread going on. Something you could expect anyway. And human beings subjecting themselves to be lab rats. Though lab dogs may also be a thing I guess ... who knows really? The director obviously knows and she knows or should know the answers to a few things that may interest you and where left open to interpretation.Is this a mirror to society? Is this supposed to warn us, that we may be heading the wrong direction? Or maybe the right direction? New beginnings and all ... so while I would agree that there are better philosophical movies (Solaris was mentioned by another reviewer), there can be others, with interesting takes on humanity, as individuals and groups of people",High Life

4,CinemaSerf,It ought to be packed off to a vacuum,4,25 November 2019,"This is a really disappointing effort from all concerned.

5,evanston_dad,Did Claire Denis Even Want Anyone to Watch This?,3,8 November 2019,"I will never understand that camp of filmmakers who make their movies so off putting it's like they don't even want anyone to watch them. Then why make them?""High Life"" feels like a bunch of randomly connected scenes populated by actors performing by themselves that were then edited together later to make it look like they were all in the same movie. These people aren't characters, or at least not characters of any depth that we learn anything about or care anything for. The film is maddeningly obtuse, needlessly so. It's one thing to make an audience do some work in putting the pieces of a film together, but another thing entirely to make that task impossible because you don't give them enough information to do so. I was physically uncomfortable watching this movie, in that fidgety, squirmy way I'm uncomfortable when a movie is so tedious and boring that I'm struggling to pay attention.And this movie has to have one of the most ridiculous masturbation scenes ever put on screen. I usually adore Juliette Binoche, but oh my goodness was she out of her depth with this one.Grade: D",High Life
6,FeastMode,i'm so angry i want to scream... GARBOOOOOOO,1,17 November 2019,"This is one of the worst movies i have seen in my life. might be top 20 all time. it has an interesting premise that is taken nowhere. or i should say is taken to all the wrong places. it might be the most boring movie of all time. i tried so hard to stay patient but i had to start watching it on higher speeds to get thru it.this movie is completely pointless, combined with it making absolutely no sense in so many ways. so many dumb moments and stupid things. so many scenes where i was baffled that the director would include this in the movie. it was poorly done in so many ways. SOOOO SLOPPY. i really don't understand how so many of these decisions were made. i HATE this movie (1 viewing 11/16/19)

lmao. i had already completely given up on this movie and was almost certainly going to give it 1/10. but my curiosity got the best of me. so i kept going so i could get to the end, altho i was watching at 6x speeds at many points, which was hilariously fine since there were extensive scenes with no dialogue and an extremely slow pace. anyway, i finally got to the end, and guess what... THERE IS NO END. the movie just stops, like some movies like doing. it's SOOOOOOOOOOOO weak. i laughed so hard and yelled OMG. i want to give it an imaginary 0/10 rating.the scenes i mentioned where i couldn't believe the director included it in the movie... definitely not about me being sensitive, i've scene tons of movies with messed up stuff like sleep rape and masturbation rooms. but......... these scenes SERVE NO PURPOSE WHATSOEVER. they are only in the movie for shock value. if you took the sleep rape scene out of the movie, and removed that character, i don't think the movie would have changed one but. same with the masturbation room. crazy bro, just crazy.",High Life
7,ThomasDrufke,"Fascinating Concept - Slow, Boring Execution",5,25 August 2019,"High Life is one of those movies where I can't deny the quality of the production and direction, but I'm also not going to try and convince anyone who didn't like it to get on board. It's an extreme slow burn with a low concept story that is exactly what common A24 viewers come to expect. The production value is way higher than you would expect for a movie that was never really going to make a ton of money at the box office, especially when the film deals with some extremely disturbing material (that black hole sequence was beyond unsettling). At the very least, it's another showcase of how good a reserved Robert Pattinson can be when playing characters with built up emotion underneath.5.8/10",High Life
8,gbill-74877,A bleak view of humanity,5,3 February 2020,"Just wasn't for me. I kept hoping for a payoff to the slow pace, questionable premise, and disquieting sex stuff, but it just didn't happen, or at least, in any big way, which was disappointing. I think I got bogged down in the illogic of it all, when the point of the film is probably more its aesthetic, and saying things about the frailty and flaws of the human condition, set against the vast cosmos.This is certainly no grand vision of humanity boldly going where no man has gone before. There barely seems to be a plan, and they're going pretty damn lethargically. Instead of a dashing crew of leaders and scientists, the best of humanity, it's a group of convicts, some of whom you wouldn't trust with your car. The idea brings to mind Australia or Georgia, but to do that in space, I don't know. How order is maintained and the prohibition against sex is upheld seems pretty implausible. Come to think of it, why there'd be such a prohibition and in its place a (good grief) and attempts at coerced artificial insemination seems kinda strange too. How there is any hope for success, I don't know, and neither could I tell you how life on this shabby ship is possibly sustainable for years on end. It seems like a cruel mission in its inception, pointless and doomed from the start.So all that points to a more symbolic journey, and to show mankind as a violent species in their fragile little ship in the vastness of space, governed by a repressive pseudo-religion that does more harm than good, bound for certain oblivion. We can be kept alive like those plants in the greenhouse, like parts in a machine, but we'll never quite completely behave. When we die, we float off into blackness, solemnly returning our atoms to the universe, the scenes of which truly are chilling. The film is highly existential, and it's telling that even the communications from back on earth are just a series of random, meaningless images. Maybe this is what Claire Denis is saying it is to be human, and maybe she has a point, but extended to 110 minutes and with such utter heaviness made it tough for me. She definitely committed to this unflinching, unromanticized vision and for that I suppose she should get some credit, but I just didn't think there was enough intelligence or balance in the script.As for the cast, it's a mixed bag, from the solid (Robert Pattinson and Juliette Binoche), to the intriguing (Mia Goth), and to the wooden (Jessie Ross, who is teenage Willow). I loved the visuals of the black hole, which are grand and terrifying, as well as the ambiguity of the ending, even if it does feel like a 2001 wannabe. As for the Solaris comparisons, aside from pace, I just don't see it.",High Life
9,Cineanalyst,Sex in Space,4,16 March 2020,"""High Life"" is obsessed with sex in space, or the lack thereof. A bunch of convicts find themselves in a new sort of prison in a spaceship far from Earth. A mother and wife who murdered her family becomes a mad doctor obsessed with procreation and mating with another man. Actually, nobody has consensual sex, which seems to be banned for whatever reason, aboard the craft. Instead, they masturbate a lot, including for the doctor's collection of sperm in her ongoing in vitro fertilization experiments. Otherwise, there's celibacy and rape. There's a room onboard specifically designated for onanism, with one scene featuring the doctor straddling a dildo chair.Images of space stand in as symbolic of a womb. There's a focus on fluids--semen, blood, water and such. Plus, there's the fertility of the garden. The picture begins with the reminder of the result of sex by way of scenes of an infant and her father. The backstory is filled in non-linearly later on, including that the rocketship is accelerating towards a black hole. There's no need to explain what the metaphor of that is. Hardly a need for the movie in general, either, which doesn't seem as interesting to me as it apparently does to some critics. The slow pacing and emptiness of space here merely seems to suggest a lack of anything compelling to move towards or to fill it with.And the seemingly-random images transmitted from Earth remain baffling to me, including the early clip from ""In the Land of the Head Hunters"" (1914), although I don't recall any horses being in that film, which is why I first thought it was from some Thomas H. Ince silent Western. Regardless, at least, that offered some brief, as they say, ""mental masturbation.""",High Life
10,westsideschl,Symbolic? Metaphoric?,2,29 July 2019,"The problem w/over reliance on presenting an analysis that it's (actually anything) highly symbolic or metaphorically ingrained is that it often just obscures/masks a lack of direction; plot foundation building, and clarity.
Story: So our on-death-row criminals are sent to investigate a black hole for it's possible rotational energy uses for humankind.
Problems:
1. The industrial shaped materials used in this vessel and other space travel accoutrements would fail a middle school science class on the design, weight & energy costs for such travel. I'm sorry, but just cheaply/quickly not thought out.
2. Time to travel to a black hole (given near infinite energy) would be an unpronounceable number. Approaching one in real world terms is impossibly dumb if not pointless.
3. OK, so that leaves a story of interpersonal dynamics in a stressful closed system. Might have gotten greater learned behavior from viewers if they picked a village in Afghanistan as our focal point as one example.",High Life
11,851222,Tedious and boring,5,1 June 2019,"Greetings from Lithuania.""High Life"" (2019) was very tedious and boring movie. It very slowly paced, and that is not a problem - the problem is that it shows a story which is difficult to understand and even more difficult to care about. Directing was pretty poor because at the running time 1 h 42 min this movie dragged beyond beliefs - i managed to watch the entire thing in like 6 or 7 times - it is that poor. Even Robert Pattinson and Juliette Binoche - two actors which i really like were wasted in this mess.Overall, ""High Life"" is not a terrible movie, but its pretty close. It tries to tell an interesting story, but does this so poorly that i can not recommend this flick to anyone.",High Life
12,UniqueParticle,Incredible cinematic experience,9,20 March 2020,"A slow burn that is bizarre and brilliant! Sensational film that reminds me a lot of 2001 Space Oydessy with originality.

The dark aspects are bit gritty but necessary for the story, love it or not this is a great movie!",High Life
13,Rodrigo_Amaro,Imaginative,9,4 July 2021,"In the future, convicts and criminals on death row or life sentences will be sent out to space to contribute with the science cause and to see if it's
possible to make babies in the outer space. A group of those convicts is locked on Station 7 along with a powerful doctor (Juliette Binoche) who collects
their fluids to provide such a test. One of those convicts is Monte (Robert Pattinson) and the story is told from his point of view and by the early minutes
on we discover that he's raising a baby in perfect conditions, all alone after everyone on board died or disappeared. ""High Life"" premise is all related how
he got into this situation and how he's gonna raise the baby in dire situations when previous tests indicated that such ordeal was not possible.Claire Denis' film combinates sci-fi with drama and some load of eroticism in telling such strange story. The rhythm is slow paced and allows viewers to
create a bond with Monte, the troubled and humanistic convict played by the great Pattinson, and also with the other inmates which includes the mother of the
child (Mia Goth), the doctor, the nice buddy (Andre Benjamin), the rapist (Ewan Mitchell) and others in the loneliness of Station 7 with an impossible mission
of which Monte doesn't want to be part of but ends up getting included.""High Life"" is about second chances and the challenges one must face with such, either one could think of being a gift or a blessing or a curse since after all
the criminal instincts are still there and everyone wants to take advantage of each other, specially when it comes to sexual acts. I've find it an interesting
sci-fi film that opens the discussion for possibilities and realities in the outer space and when movies deal with those issues where you can imagine things
and aspects that haven't been talked before (or at least in the way this film does it) then you get my interest. Sure, I was anxious for more answers or even for
a more thrilling adventure (which never happened, except in the final minutes) but I was curious in seeing how things would turn out. By the end of it, I was
witnessing a miracle of a movie and all I've watched made total sense. But I don't understand why the low rating it gets on here. Guess people were expecting a
more horror/adventure movie instead of a dramatic oriented piece.The cast is very good, notably Pattinson who spends the early minutes all by himself with a baby; the few special effects are also good - goes to show that when
you have a decent story you don't have to spend much on the visuals - and Denis direction was precise, establishing early on the kind of movie we're about to see.""High Life"" is a pretty decent film, weird on some extremes but on touch with reality, possibilities and how life goes to strange bumps to finally reveal our true
destiny. Monte is totally opposite to the project, practically forced to it, but as the story progresses he was the perfect specimen and person for it and end up
going pretty well as a father - as evidenced right on the first scenes and the conclusion. But until he got there it took him ages of abstinence and self-control
being the object of admiration from the crazed doctor, who also has a past as a killer of children, her own, and now desperatly tries to find ways to reproduction
work in space. Gotta admire such conflicted characters and their ordeals. 9/10.",High Life
14,eddie_baggins,A nasty and confusing Sci-Fi experience,3,29 May 2019,"If you've watched the trailer or read the synopsis for High Life, the new film from highly regarded yet low-key filmmaker Claire Denis, and think that what you're getting is a story about a father and his daughter trying to survive life in deep space aboard a mysterious vessel, then you're in for a mighty big shock.While Denis's ponderous event film certainly does feature large portions of its rudiment focused on Robert Pattinson's Monte trying to take care of his space vessel and his young daughter Willow, High Life is most certainly not the film it may first appear to be thanks to Denis's wild vision that looks to tackle some of the big existential questions about life, love, procreation and survival under the guise of a cerebral science fiction experience.It all starts off relatively straightforward and intriguing, as with very little background or set-up we are introduced to Monte and his odd existence on an unnamed spacecraft, traversing the great unknown with his baby daughter in toe, tending to a greenhouse and reporting back to a source on their progress to maintain a life supply system but despite the films strong opening act that includes some arresting visuals and mood setting, High Life quickly takes a turn towards the bizarre as Denis's true motivations for her film become more apparent.Don't expect to know about why many things in High Life happen, as this is not a part of the apparent nature of Denis's film, but suffice to say viewers will be shocked and perhaps even traumatized by what they will witness in this downright grimy and grungy cinematic experience that will most surely make you feel like taking a cold shower at the conclusion of its credits.Joined by supports that includes Andrew Benjamin, Mia Goth and a very game Juliette Binoche, High Life is a downright odd and confusing affair that includes a room with a very adult orientated toy, shocking acts of violence and an occasional splash of visual brilliance as Pattinson (whose post Twilight career continues to surprise) holds his head above water and anchors the film around him in what is an times intriguing film that's too cold and bizarre for its own good.There will be those that love Denis's unique vision for the space-set genre and the questions she is possibly (or quite possibly not) asking about mankind and our desires/wants but with a cast of characters we never build a firm affirmation for, an abundance of questionable and barely explained character decisions and a general sense of lethargy present in most of the film, many will find High Life anything but the experience they were chasing after.Final Say -Head into High Life expecting it to be the film it appears to be and you will walk away sorely disappointed but head into it expecting it to be a wild head-trip doesn't make it much better. An often nasty, irksome and sometimes daring feature, High Life is a unique ride that fails to justify its confusing and hard to understand motivations.1 ½ space dog out of 5",High Life
15,howard.schumann,Examines the limits of human behavior under extreme conditions,10,1 May 2019,"In a mission from which they have little chance of returning, a group of condemned prisoners elect to undertake a voyage to the deepest regions of outer space to attempt to harness the energy of a black hole and, as one of the convicts explains, turn their shame to glory. French director Claire Denis' (""Let the Sunshine In"") first English-language film, High Life, is science-fiction minus the expected alien warlords, lightsaber battles, or dazzling special effects. The film, according to Denis, is not about conquest but about isolation and what it means to be human. It is a film that examines the limits of human behavior under extreme conditions. Much of it is not pretty.Co-written by Denis, Jean-Pol Fargeau (""Bastards"") and Geoff Cox, and photographed by cinematographer Yorick Le Saux (""Personal Shopper""), the film takes place far outside the solar system, near the Milky Way. Unlike the compliant society of Aldous Huxley's ""Brave New World,"" the travelers aboard the unnamed floating penal colony are untethered to any social norms, often aggressive, even brutal in fulfilling their immediate needs. Without a linear narrative, Denis keeps us guessing as to when events are taking place and is not in any hurry to connect the dots. In time, however, the experience becomes so immersive that it almost doesn't matter.High Life opens in a lush garden that might just as well be in your back yard as in the heavens. Here, fruits and vegetables grow alongside exotic plants, providing food and oxygen to the entombed crew. Though there is a row of hanging space suits in the ship's rust-colored corridor, the only person we see is a man on the outside of the ship ostensibly replacing a part. Against this backdrop of infinite blackness, the cries of a baby are heard. The cry interrupts the man's job and returns him to his immediate task of raising a child in space: Preparing baby food, teaching her to walk, letting her know with determination what the word ""taboo"" means, and informing her in no uncertain terms that her crying is ""going to kill me."" The plea, however, falls on deaf ears.In a film that has many disturbing images, the interaction between Monte (Robert Pattinson, ""The Lost City of Z"") and his infant daughter Willow (Scarlett Lindsay) evokes an exquisite tenderness. In spite of the unrevealed crimes that have brought him to this point, the emotional strength displayed in Pattinson's striking performance is the only anchor we have to hold onto. Even on a voyage to nowhere where solitude threatens to overwhelm, the expression of his love for the child - how he holds her, looks at her, and comforts her is deeply moving. Denis explains, ""His (Monte's) friends are dead and his life no longer has any meaning. But the baby forces him not to commit suicide. In a way, she obliges him to become a man again - to share and communicate.""Each day Monte sends a status report, asking for and receiving another twenty-four-hour grant of life support - from whom or what is not clear. In flashback, we see the other passengers of the spaceship, now long gone and much of the film describes their interaction. Among the women are Doctor Dibs (Juliette Binoche, ""Ghost in the Shell""), Boyse (Mia Goth, ""Suspiria""), Nansen (Agata Buzek, ""The Innocents""). The men consist of Chandra (Lars Eidinger, ""Clouds of Sils Maria""), the mission's captain, Tcherny (André Benjamin, ""Semi-Pro""), who takes care of the greenhouse, and the slightly unhinged Ettore (Ewan Mitchell, ""The Last Kingdom"" TV series) who meets a gruesome fate. Though how each one of them meets their fate is not spelled out, there is a memorable scene where the cryogenically frozen remains of others are thrown off the ship, dangling in space until resuming their voyage to eternity.Dibs is a scientist who fits the stereotype of the ""mad scientist."" In Binoche's recreation, Dibs is a woman of enormous energy with big ideas. Though sex is forbidden on board, the spaceship has a room called ""the F-Box,"" which contains what can only be described as a sex machine and the film offers a lengthy sequence of the naked Dibs writhing in pleasure and pain with the help of a silver dildo. Trying to escape her criminal past, she believes that it is her mission to create babies in space, albeit the perfect child, as penance for her crimes. As each male crew member donates his sperm, the women on board are impregnated, but the babies are immediately taken away before they can be nursed.The resulting scientific data about being born in space are relayed back to Earth, but to what end is uncertain. The only resistant one is Monte. Selflessly guarding his privacy, his sperm is extracted by Dibs when he is sleeping and planted in Boyse, the most rebellious of the crew. On the surface, High Life is barely a cut above despair, yet underneath a heart is beating. Though Monte is the one person who avoids connection, he is the only one left on board with someone to care for, an infant who depends on him for survival, requiring him to transcend his emotional deadness and discover hidden reservoirs of compassion.As the ship approaches a black hole and the texture mysteriously changes from black and white to color, Monte asks his now teenage daughter Willow (Jessie Ross, ""The Frankenstein Chronicles"" TV series) the enigmatic question, ""Shall we?"" Like the wild dance of Galoup in Denis' ""Beau Travail"" which seems to exist outside of space and time, the question ""Shall we?"" evokes the dance of love, inseparable and timeless. In the poet Rumi's phrase, ""All that is profane becomes sacred again.""",High Life

Binoche and Pattison shine,8,20 April 2019,"""High Life"" brings the story of a group of 9 outcasts, traveling towards the nearest black hole. As the movie opens, a guy is doing a space walk to repair the space ship. He is also in communication with a baby girl, presumably his daughter, who becomes restless. He comes back insides the space ship and takes care of her. No sign of the mother, or anyone else for that matter, that is until the guy enters a room where a number of people are in hibernation--or are they dead? At this point we are 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest film from respected French director (and co-writer) Claire Denis, whose previous film was the excellent ""Let the Sun Shine In"" (starring Juliette Binoche). ""High Life"" actually is Denis' first English language movie. The movie is plot-heavy so I really din't want to see much more of that, other than we do of course learn in flashbacks how these 9 end up at that particular point in time, and let me tell you, it is one wild ride. I kept thinking to myself, ""this is a Space Oddysey of a very different kind!'. Binoche stars again, and she is utterly brilliant. Robert Pattison does quite well as the guy we get to know in the opening scenes. Mia Goth, whom we saw last year in the excellent ""Suspiria"", is also noteworthy. BEWARE: there are several ultra-violent and, frankly, shocking scenes in the film. ""High Life"" is definitely not for the faint of heart, that is for sure. But I found is an intriguing, unusual and origianl ""space movie"" that kept my attention from start to finish (ah, yes, that ending...).""High Life"" premiered and last falls Toronto International Film Festival, and I have been waiting for an opportunity to see it ever since. The movie finally arrived at my local art-house theater this weekend here in Cincinnati, and I immediately went to see it. The Friday early evening screening where I saw this at was not attended well (7 people, including myself). That's a darn shame. Hopefully the movie will gain a wider audience as it is released on other platforms. IF you are in the mood for an unusual space drama, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",High Life

It's intriguing and interesting at times, and tiresome and boring at others. I think the problem is the director's reliance on a non-linear narrative.

22,drownnnsoda,Bleak anti-character character study,7,23 April 2019,"""High Life"" follows a group of criminals cast out into space on an mission searching for alternative energy forms. Among them are Monte, a young man serving a life sentence for murder; Dibs, a corrupt doctor who manipulates the passengers hoping to conceive a child; Boyse, an ex-crack addict; and Tcherny, a convict who has left his wife and son on earth. As the mission moves forward, the interpersonal dynamics between the passengers begin to putrefy.Told in vaguely non-linear shreds of time, ""High Life"" begins with a series of plodding, quiet moments between a father and his infant daughter, before splintering into the past and future, exposing the sources of the characters' current situations by the means of their pasts. Time is, unsurprisingly, a key theme in the film, although in an atypical way; this manifests most prominently in Monte, the protagonist, whose past on earth returns to him even light years away from it.Director Claire Denis presents her story in small moments, some of which are poignant, and others which are revulsive. Human sexuality and violence are equally presented in their most stripped-down, primal forms, which can perturb a more sentimental audience. This sort of sterile bleakness pervades the entire narrative, and the individual characters are sketched in a way that betrays Denis' storytelling mode; this results in a film that is ultimately structured as a character study, but which does little in exploring (or exposing) its characters. They remain vague, and ultimately, suspended. This is perhaps the most frustrating thing about the film, be it an intentional move on Denis' part or not.Aside from this, the performances here are strong, with Robert Pattinson proving himself a formidable, thoughtful character actor, and Juliette Binoche playing the doctor who oscillates between a vulnerable woman and an outright siren. Mia Goth makes another great turn here as a free-spirited addict who finds herself tormented by the situation, and André Benjamin portrays perhaps the most reflective, grounded individual onboard.The film, as I saw it, ends on a surprisingly optimistic note, though Denis is certainly playing with a double entendre here that can be read two ways. In the end, I felt the film works best at providing the audience windows into the characters' pasts as well as their mundane lives aboard the mission, as these allows the audience to get closer; however, Denis denies us too much closeness, and in the end there is a space between the viewer and the characters that is frustratingly palpable. We never quite get there, but that is possibly what Denis wanted. 7/10.",High Life
23,Pairic,Intriguing SF,8,16 May 2019,"High Life: An astronaut, Monte (Robert Pattinson) is outside a spacecraft making repairs when a baby's wailing disturbs him. They are the only two inhabitants of the ship which is in a state of disrepair with it's systems constantly at risk of failure, Monte freezes in terror as the electricity goes off but then resumes. To preserve power Monte ejects bodies which had been frozen. Even the hydroponics room is a bit ragged. How this situation developed is told in a series of flashbacks.All of the ship's crew were criminals, on death row or serving life sentences. Dr Dibs (Juliette Binoche) is conducting experiments on the other prisoners, trying to create a baby through artificial insemination. Boyse (Mia Goth) is a troubled young woman who is both violent and subjected to violence. Dibs has control over the crew through the use of sedatives. The ship's main mission is to seek alternative energy sources through studying a Black Hole, light years from Earth. Nansen (Agata Buzek) will pilot a small craft closer to the Black Hole.A claustrophobic film, shot in narrow corridors and small rooms, even the reminiscences of Earth are on trains bounded by the tracks or on forest trails closed in by trees. When Nansen drops a tool into the space void (the only wider vista) he thinks of dropping an apple down a well. The scene of the disgorged bodies floating through space is haunting. In this closed society violence occurs which threatens the survival of all. The crew had been promised that the mission was a second chance but due to the effects of relativity they age years while for those on Earth centuries pass.The effects and design are generally ok, especially how the decay of the ship is portrayed and how the super-gravity of a Black Hole might affect a human body. But the spacesuits have that bought from Lidl look and the spaceship resembles a pedestal. Far more imagination has gone into the script and direction. This is a disturbing film with scenes which may well shock you but you will muse over its implications and meaning long after the final credits roll. Directed and co-written by Clair Denis. 8/10.",High Life

25,peterp-450-298716,An arty SF. Not for every moviegoer.,4,5 July 2019,"I fear, Willow.
I could drown like a kitten.
It would have been easy.
First you, then me.The film ""High Life"" is just as meaningful as the expedition for which those sentenced to death have registered voluntarily. Not very meaningful. I do understand why they have chosen for it. The choice of sitting in a cell and staring emptily into space until the end of days. Or a space journey for many years with a black hole as a final destination from which they will try to produce energy. No wonder they prefer freedom, albeit to a limited extent, than to die in a cell. However, being on board of this ship isn't exactly fun and quite boring. I'm convinced most of them already regret the fact they volunteered. I'm also surprised that these serious criminals haven't killed each other yet after a certain period. Most likely out of boredom. Even the footage isn't something to get excited about. And some of these volunteers are also extremely irritating. In short, I won't use the words captivating, fascinating and the film title in one and the same sentence.I'm sure that fans of arty SF films will get excited while watching ""High Life"". And when a philosophical message has been incorporated in it, I'm sure there will be others who'll sit in front of the screen, gasping excitedly. Unfortunately, it also had a sleep-inducing effect on me. It also gave me a feeling of hope. Such hope many visitors of the statue of Mary in Lourdes will envy me for. And that's the hope for a surprising turn or an action-rich incident that would give the storyline a sudden boost in terms of drama and excitement. Forget it. The story progressed reluctantly without deviating from its boring course and the content remained fairly empty. A bit like this spaceship that moved on steadily deep into infinite and empty outer space.A few words of sincere admiration for Robert Pattinson though. This young actor, better known for his cooperation in the whole ""Twilight"" saga (something I hate passionately), tries to break away with this notorious past in his own way. After his contribution to ""The Last City of Z"", where he was practically unrecognizable thanks to his immense, rough beard, and ""The Rover"", he again tries to play an unusual role in a non-commercial film. However, you can't really call this role brilliant since his character is fairly silent and withdrawn. Even though that shaved para-command hairstyle suggests he's someone with a short fuse. The beginning of the film shows him as a caring father who takes care of his baby daughter on an apparently abandoned space ship. It's only after flashbacks that we find out what happened during this suicide mission.The opposite of Monte you'll get to know in the person of the fairly crazy and slightly aggressive scientist Dibs (Juliette ""The 33"" Binoche). Her presence transforms this space journey into an experimental trip. She certainly wouldn't have been out of place as a camp doctor in a concentration camp during the Second World War. The crew is used as human guinea pigs to optimize the reproduction process. How she gets a satisfactory result later in the film, is too bizarre to believe. However, after you've seen her erotic act, that takes place in a dark room (where the crew members can fulfill their sexual fantasies), it's not so surprising that she used that controversial method. That steamy erotically charged scene reminded me of the game ""Virtual Valerie"" for the Macintosh, one way or another.All the time I had this feeling as if I was watching an unfinished end product. A paper-thin idea around which a very artistic-looking film was embroidered. However, it's nothing more than a psychological study of conflicts between people in an enclosed space and the way in which their survival instinct emerges. Erotic scenes alternate with fairly violent events. And in between, many moments of reveries and soundless aesthetically pleasing film moments. ""High Life"" is not a film for the average moviegoer. For that, it's doing a little too much to be arty. It's not easy to follow and also ends with a non-explanatory final scene. What remains is one conclusion and one unresolved question. First of all a deep bow for Robert Pattinson who has grown as an actor and distances himself from his adolescent audience. And the pressing question that remains: could someone explain to me scientifically why it is that the corpses which Monte throws out the ship, actually fall down? That's something that intrigues me.More reviews here: movie-freak.be",High Life

If you enjoy arthouse films, then you should probably give this a shot- it has some wonderfully meditative themes, some great performances, and a completely original story.

27,Reviews_of_the_Dead,"Bit Slow, but Socially Relevant",7,2 May 2019,"This was a film that I saw a trailer for it and I was somewhat intrigued. When I saw it was from A24, I figured that I would see it. Plus it allowed me to have a 2019 horror film to keep up with my pace. The synopsis of the film is a father and his daughter struggle to survive in deep space where they live in isolation.We follow Monte (Robert Pattinson) as he is trying to fix something outside of the space craft. There is a baby that he is taking care of named Willow (Scarlett Lindsey) in a make-shift playpen. She starts to cry and he loses a wrench that falls into the nothingness of space. It is during this that we learn that they are the only two left alive on this ship.The film then fills us in the back-story while shifting back and forth between the past and the present. This ship is full of criminals. We see what caused Monte to be here, which happened when he was a child. Their mission is to go to a black hole to see if they can harvest energy from it which could be limitless on Earth. The problem though, which we learn from a priest is that this is a suicide mission for criminals who think there is a chance to survive.There is a secondary mission though. Dibs (Juliette Binoche) is trying to impregnate the women on the ship with the sperm from the males on it. Monte refuses to provide his, but Tcherny (André Benjamin), Chandra (Lars Eidinger) and Ettore (Ewan Mitchell) all agree to, because they are given drugs in exchange. Dibs grows attracted to the strength of Monte and believes he is the key to completing the mission that she is tasked with.We never fully learn how long Monte and Willow are stranded alone, but she does grow up to be Jessie Ross. Things take quite a turn when they encounter another ship much like theirs. They have to make a decision on to continue to survive and what type of life they're living.Now this film really has a basic storyline, but there are a lot of deeper issues this film is exploring. To start off, I want to go with the idea of the punishment system. There's the issue that they are sending all of these criminals, which includes Dibs, on a mission that they don't expect to succeed. The issue becomes if this is cruel or not. Personally, I think that this would be better than living in a cell for the rest of my life. It's raised by Tcherny, which I know is also affecting Ettore, the longer they are out there, they become stir crazy and lose it. Especially in America, the punishment system is a hot button issue as we have the highest population of incarcerated individuals and still being the only civilized country to still have the death penalty if my memory serves.The next issue this film concerns itself with is children and childbirth. It is crazy that Dibs is here, we learn, because she murdered her children. She believes that she can create an almost perfect child through her tests. There is the issue of radiation they have to deal with and the fact that they're some violent criminals on board this ship. Boyse (Mia Goth) doesn't want to take part in the experiment. She doesn't believe she can carry a child to term. There is an aspect that I'll get to shortly that involves her and even Monte. To go even farther, there is the imaginary of the black hole that I started to think looks like a vagina and the womb. That really makes this one of the biggest aspects to this film along with sexuality in general.Being that they are criminals, the issue of rape is visited a few times. The first is that Ettore finally loses his mind and tries to rape Boyse. Mink (Claire Tran) tries to stop him along with others. He never does consummate his act, but he is quite violent about it. There's the flip side to it with what happens between Dibs and Monte. He is known that to be celibate and doesn't want to provide his fluids. Dibs violates this trust with not only him, but with Boyse as well. This actually devastates Boyse from the events that play out after.Going from this back to childbirth, there is the aspect of someone like Monte, who is sounds like has been incarcerated his whole life trying to raise his child right. He even goes from the jail cell to the space ship. When you see the two of them interact, it isn't the most natural, but he is doing a good job. That just shows though that despite your upbringing, if you put forth the effort, you can raise them correctly.This brings me to the pacing of the film. I think that this is where I am down on it. I think it is a bit too long and even though I normally like slow-burn type films, this one is too slow. I think there is a good portion of it where just nothing happens. We don't even really get much from the characters in this time either. I like the messages the film is putting forth and the possible implications of the ending, but it really just had trouble keeping me focused on what was happening.It is a shame though, because I thought the acting was really good. Pattinson is a guy that I personally looked down on from his time in Twilight, but everything since then he has been impressive. I like the subdued way he played the role, because it is like someone who has been in jail for a long time and is trying to keep out of trouble. He isn't afraid to say what he is thinking and he is doing a good job raising his child. I thought he was really good. Binoche is interesting, because being a doctor we think she is good. It is revealed though she has done some horrible things which set the table for what she does on this mission. Benjamin was solid as was Goth. She really is such a horror icon for the amount of roles in the genre she is taking on. The rest of the cast rounded out the film for what was needed as well.To the effects of the film, there actually weren't a lot of them. The majority were seeing stars and things in space. I thought the black hole and things around it were stunning. It is interesting that is looks quite similar to the first picture taken of one as well. The spaceship doesn't look great though, I will be honest there. It does feel like they are on a spaceship so I have to give credit there. I do think the film was shot very well though.As for the soundtrack of the film, much like Pattinson's performance, it is subdued. I think that actually works. The film has a much more eerie feel that there is no sound. It was actually making me anxious at times. When we do get it, it is normally while looking at the black hole, where it is very light, but it does add an ambiance to what we are seeing.Now with that said, I could see a lot of people not really considering this a horror. I think the horror in this film comes from the issues that are looked at in the film. I would definitely put it on the borderline though. Bringing up the issues, I really did like that part of the film. It really had me thinking at the things I was seeing. On top of that there were some really good performances in the film. The pacing though was a bit off and I found the film to be quite boring at times. There weren't a lot in the way of effects or a soundtrack, but I think both aspects work for what they did give us. Overall though I would say this is an above average film. It definitely isn't for everyone as I found it to be a slow-burn that was even a bit of a chore for me to get through.",High Life
28,robertemerald,Too much unexplained drama in this low budget indie,6,2 December 2019,"It's really hard to actually know what the story is in High Life. Robert Pattison gives a half-hearted narration here and there, which is pessimistic and depressed, yet to which the viewer must listen attentively for the clues it gives as to what is going on. More is revealed (eventually) by various scenes than the narration. The spaceship starts off with maybe 8 people, none of whom are particularly nice to one another. Add to this the sets within the spacecraft, which are more like cheap and cramped apartments than an advanced technological vehicle, and it becomes hard to find anything enjoyable about this movie, and worse, anything interesting. True, the basic message is how people would perform in cramped spaces over a long interstellar journey. Not well according to this, with sex becoming an obsession for some, and not always in ways ordinary folk would appreciate. So much sex!!! Even the space ship itself is basically just a box. Here and there are some galactic visuals and various attempts to be poetic about space travel. The soundtrack is spooky, which says something as well I think, with sounds such as singing saws or tortured freeform jazz. Let's be clear. High Life is an indie movie, despite the well known stars.",High Life

THIS FILM IS NOT RECOMMENDED.
IN BRIEF: Silly outer space trash posing as high art.
JIM'S REVIEW: In the first 20 minutes of High Life, we watch a father
dealing with a crying infant and coping with her demands as he
goes about everyday chores: feeding regimes, baths, playtime,
repairing a section of his spacecraft, etc. Yes, both are the sole
survivors aboard a ship in outer space that also has 6 or 7
unexplained dead travelers in other compartments. How they all got
there is an intriguing beginning to the mystery. But just as how this
film was ever made, unfortunately, remains a mystery that has no
rhyme or reason. By the film's inconclusive conclusion, you just may
want to jump ship into the dark void.The film's non-linear story drones on and on before we realize that the ship's crew are prisoners on a death mission to help Earth from a problematic black hole. Helmed by French director Claire Denis and co-written with Jean-Pol Fargeau, this wonky sci-fi film tries to intellectualizes its plot and confusingly time warps from past to present. The overall result is disoriented, bizarre, and repulsive as each unpleasant character is dispatched in grisly and suicidal ways.The muddled screenplay depicts a group of criminals who are part of an experiment by Dr. Dibs (a misguided Juliette Binoche, giving one of her worst performances ever). She is in mad scientist mode, obsessed with sex, masturbation, and artificial insemination, a commonality shared by Ms. Denis, the director. Her camera obsessively lingers on bodily fluids: lactating breasts, blood, semen, etc. It also ogles the film's main character, Monte, hoping for a glimpse of his full monty. This anti-hero happens to be the only celibate character on the spacecraft. Played with sincerity by Robert Pattinson, his Monte has some redeeming moments, most horizontally. Gratuitous nudity by everyone else in the cast seems to run rampant aboard this traveling sex barge, be it male or female. At this point, I surrendered to the movie's bubble-headed outrageousness posing as high art.Now we all know that air travel can be a very stressful experience. But this transport has a built-in special room called ""The Box"" to relieve one's sexual tension. Reserved for intimate sessions of self-love for any staff member or Dr. Dibs herself, there is first class accommodations at your service. In fact, the good doctor is a frequent visitor who literally calls dibs on that private space rather often! It all too 50 shades of Dibs to be taken seriously.The whole film is an embarrassment of sexual delights, especially coming from such an esteemed filmmaker as Ms. Denis. This is her first English speaking film, but she gets rather tongue tied as her movie is lost in translation. While there are some haunting visuals of outer space travel, the film is very slow going. One waits for some clarity or rationale which never arrives.High Life is an artsy-fartsy black hole that will suck the life out of any moviegoer. Beware!",High Life

31,blott2319-1,Pointless drivel masquerading as high art,1,13 April 2020,"If movies had minds of their own, then High Life would be a film that actively dislikes me. It feigns qualities that I might enjoy like a sci-fi plot and some interesting non-linear story-telling, but then reveals that it is overrun with qualities I hate. For starters, it is entirely populated by unlikeable characters. Robert Pattinson is meant to be the one redeemable presence in the film, but he is so stiff and bland it's hard to care about him. Everyone in the film is an admitted criminal and most of them are happy to continue committing appalling crimes on their mission to a nowhere. High Life is also obsessed with sex in all its many forms. There were a few scenes I simply could not watch because they were simultaneously ridiculous and disgusting. The writer/director's apparent fascination with the taboos of sex are not included in the film for a good reason, but simply because the insane doctor on board is trying to forcibly impregnate women. I don't think that's a key plot point, just something that is happening while they fly to their death. Of course, I could be wrong, because the plot of the film is almost non-existent.I wish High Life had a proper plot, but even the parts that were easy to understand were stupid. The entire concept of a spaceship full of insane people is pointless and moronic. I realize that whoever sent them is looking for a disposable crew but you can't expect rapists, murderers, and other petty criminals to do anything of use for you. They might as well have sent a shuttle full of chimps, and they'd get the same amount of scientific information from this mission. But more than anything else, the thing that irritated me about High Life was the fact that Claire Denis clearly values art over story. Some people love this kind of esoteric crap, but it is worse than nails on a chalkboard for me. The film is constantly sacrificing story for visuals, and takes painfully long periods of time on almost every scene. I hate when movies slow down so much when nothing is happening. It always feels like cheap film student tricks to give the illusion that something has greater meaning or significance simply because it takes time. I wanted to give High Life a fair shot, but it clearly had no interest in entertaining me. Perhaps it will be kinder to you.",High Life

The prisoners are also being used by a physician (Juliette Binoche) to produce a baby via artificial insemination.As a director, Claire Denis succeeds in creating an atmosphere that is mysterious and leaves the viewer curious. However, she fails as a co-screenwriter (along with Jean-Pol Fargeau). The overall concept and the stories within it are interesting but they are mostly incoherent and often incomprehensible. Other science-fiction films succeed when deliberately withholding information, leaving the viewer to fill in the blanks. This does not work in ""High Life"" as too much information is withheld.

33,gizmomogwai,Mind-blowing,8,30 January 2021,"High Life is obviously a polarizing film, as if it weren't obvious by looking at the user reviews. Grown out of the gardens of Solaris, I feel it is worth of those origins. It tells the story of ex-cons sent into space to perform scientific experiments. One man has a daughter, and they journey to complete their mission, to extract energy from a black hole.Similar to Kris Kelvin, we have a sad-eyed protagonist with a tragic past; unlike Kelvin, he's trying to make a good man out of himself, and reaches the cusp of heroics. What really stands out about High Life, to me, is its direction and cinematography - mesmerizing in its style, it hits us with nightmare images again and again, and sucks the viewer into its universe, allowing those receptive to it to feel its lonely, turned loving atmosphere.There are things about this film that scare me. According to the protagonist's final report, some 210 years have passed on Earth since they launched 18 years ago. That makes me think not only about how many have died or which nations have fallen, but whether there are any humans left on Earth at all. Could our protagonist and his daughter now be alone in the universe, humanity's only representatives? This sense of isolation is heightened in a scene where they discover another ship. Could this be the fate of humankind - relict survivors in space? Or can our protagonists give humankind on Earth a wealth of resources and riches? Are they heroes or lost souls? Does it matter if they have each other, and their mission? High Life is an abstract painting - see in it what you will.",High Life

35,rockman182,High Life (2019),6,8 April 2019,"I've heard of Claire Denis but shamefully have never seen any of her work. I liked the trailer for this film. It seemed like a high concept space thriller, which as you know is something that is in my wheelhouse. I also have faith in everything A24 produces so I had to see this as soon as it came out. Having watched it the film is certainly visually arresting and quite disturbing. I'm not sure it fully meets what I was hoping for but Denis's film is thought provoking and asks questions of what humans in loneliness would do when on the brink of madness.The film is about a space crew consisting of criminals and their mission of going towards a black hole to find a new energy source. The space crew soon realize that the doctor on the ship has some alternative ideas that include invasive sexual procedures meant to create life. I'm still not exactly certain on the solidity of that plot but this is the general gist. Robert Pattinson and Juliette Binoche lead with supporting performances from Andre 3000 and the always lovely Mia Goth.There's talent on display in High Life. Pattinson is a very solid actor as could be seen from his other A24 feature, Good Time. The film looks like an authentic look into a space ship and I thought the film possessed some brilliant cinematography and camera handling. I especially liked the look of the black hole and the actions that occurred when approaching the black hole. I like when science fiction films (space ones namely) maintain the integrity of science and that seemed to be the case here.The film borders on being very out there almost drifting off in plot like the bodies in space. What we see though is a fairly disturbing sexually charged mission in space with characters descending into utter madness and chaos. The film is definitely reminiscent of other space films before it but Denis strives to set it apart. I think its an impressively made film though it doesn't always work for me. It may require another watch to fully grasp and comprehend what Denis tried to go for.6.5/10",High Life

37,kjproulx,Great Filmmaking. Muddled Execution.,5,25 April 2019,"Science fiction filmmaking has always been one of the more interesting genres to me, due to the fact that your stories can be filled with endless imagination. From amazing films like 2001: A Space Odyssey to even mediocre blockbusters in Interstellar, they're always filled with concepts that impress me. Even if a sci-fi movie hits theatres and has me incredibly against it by the time the credits roll, I still usually find myself pleased with the visual style or the ambition behind the story as a whole. In the case of High Life, I absolutely admired everything about this movie, but I probably won't be telling anyone to rush out and watch it.Following Monte, as he floats around in a shuttle drifting through space, he and his infant daughter try to survive, alone. With flashbacks to previous events and character interactions that explain their current situation, this is a film that begins very ambiguous, but ultimately becomes bogged down in exposition and overly complex narrative choices, that simply had me frustrated with the movie overall. The premise of the film itself and the visual style that they were able to pull off on a budget of just over 10 million dollars.I absolutely loved everything about this movie that revolved around Monte (who was played very well by Robert Pattinson) and his daughter. Their growth throughout the film and development within their characters easily felt like the most impressive aspect. As mentioned above, the flashbacks and overly explanatory sequences took me out of the film. Not to ruin what the flashbacks consist of, but it was far less interesting than the present day timeline and they balanced the present day with the past quite evenly in terms of the film's run time, which was disappointing to me.Although noticeably low-budget, this is a very nicely shot film with some very unique sci-fi visuals. I wasn't completely sucked in, because some of the sets and ways certain scenes played out felt slightly cheap in my opinion. I'm not usually someone who complains about this, because filmmaking is insanely hard to get right, especially on a low-budget, but something about the atmosphere of this movie felt slightly off to me.In the end, High Life is the pure example of a movie that's not made for everyone. Even if I loved this movie, I still wouldn't recommend it, simply because there are many things presented throughout this movie that will turn off many viewers. I admired my experience with this movie as a whole and would've given the filmmakers a round of applause if they were at the screening, but the movie just didn't click with me in the ways I had hoped for. A very solidly constructed movie that just didn't quite work for me.",High Life

Also, there is Juliette Binoche as a narcissistic jailkeeper, so what more do you need?! Claire Denis was able to realize her compelling vision with adequate financial support and star power. Everything aligns for her so well; the cinematography of looking at space, stars and nebulas, the cast, the themes and vision, action and depth, . . so, so good!",High Life
39,Headturner1,I totally agree with the other reviewers,3,3 June 2019,"I watched the trailer and thought this looks stupid.All you see is Da da and some other stuff and Da, da. I watched 20 min it took to show the name of the movie?!? Usually something really exciting happens then they do that. So 50 minutes in I'm like what's going on this is ridiculous and baby crying. I realized it was Pattinson 30 min in and was thinking well now I'll remember him for this crap and not twighlight. I kept thinking why aren't these kids just having sex instead of inseminating them. a tape scene thrown in and the ridiculous and unbelievableness of it. I don't even want to type it out. The unwarranted scene of her in the sex box or whatever ( thought might be sexy as she took her hair down and slowly undid her uniform) was just disgusting and creepy. Imo it was the scariest scene in the movie. You think being suck together they'd make friends. closest thing was pattisnson and the one black gentlemen. Was just awful. When the daughter grows up she is a horrible actor. The baby was better. I felt all weird when it was over and relieved( tho there was no ending) I needed to watch something uplifting to wash this crap out of my mind.

42,ThurstonHunger,Therapy in Space,7,31 October 2020,"Part of my 202 pandemic panoply has resonated with a (star) fleet of films dealing with people (well men as it turns out, where's Sigourney Weaver when you need her) taking very small, very isolated steps in a vast galactic space.Ad Astra, Moon and now High Life. Very different films, and budgets. Here Claire Denis effort feels like a bit of a follow-up to Silent Running. But in each film, wrestling with the dangers out work off the planet, is accompanied by work inside the confines of one's own head-space.Granted this film could also be a take on IVF in Space (and I wonder if Ms. Denis and Juliette Binoche discussed that as part of their re-bonding, they are siring interesting films together). Binoche as a bad-ass renegade scientist here, never mind her time inside version 9.3 of what was once Woody Allen's ""orb"" in Sleeper) was a fascinating watch, as much as Robert Pattinson in the lead role of Monte. Is that a nod to Monte Cristo?That said even the few minor characters enrich the overall soil of this film.There's a lot to ""High Life"", but it's not spent in its CGI or prop budget. The space ship is decidedly done up in low tenement style, there are taboos toyed with...and much of the acting takes place in the cranio-veins of Pattinson.As in ""Moon"" personally I felt a little bit of humans are here to serve the AI, very trace quantities, but nonetheless my sensors picked them up.I think even viewing outside of the COVID-19 shadow, this film and the series would have a claustrophobic effect, that might put some off, but sort of had me valuing each breath and action.Outside of this, I'm certainly rooting for Denis. I am still saddened by the 2019 loss of Agnes Varda, but the two seem to be unflinching in their pursuit of films that like the directors themselves, I bet will age well in their own fierce independent way.",High Life
43,Alexander_Blanchett,Different approach for a SciFi survival film,8,30 May 2019,"It was a good film with an interesting concept. Always been a fan of film about isolation and also taking place ins pace. This had both with some really nice mystery elements. Sometimes director Claire Denis exaggerated a bit with the story and character decisions tho.... What was great is that the story slowly and slowy developes and gives you hints about what it really is about besides the basic plot of a father with his infant daughter who tries to survive in deep space.
Robert Pattinson gives a great performance and delivers once more prove that he is really a talented and promising actor especially in the indie field. He along with Juliette Binoche gives the best performance in the film although the character he plays (just like all other characters in the film) is quite unlikeable. Binoche is really crazy here which is great to see because she breaks out of her usual boundaries. The look is surprisingly but intentionally cheap and generally the film has a VERY unusual look for a film taking place in space, especially the technology presented is like out of a 70s film. Very weird approach for it. The film offers many surprises and mystery and although it had an ambitious ending I wasn't really a fan of I like date psychological and philosophical aspects of it.

45,garethcrook,Well if there were ever a misleading title...,4,8 March 2021,"Life in space is an interesting idea. I don't mean it existing, are there aliens etc. I mean people living their lives out there. That's what Monte (Robert Pattinson) is doing in Claire Denis' High Life. He's a worker of sorts. Maintenance, cultivation, mundane tasks. A mundane life... in space. At least that's where his story is headed. He's there on board some kind of space station, my with a baby named Willow. They are alone, aside the room of bodies that Monte throws out of the hatch into space. It's slow start, broody, dark. All stuff that Pattinson is good at. It's also very stylish as space thrillers often are. We're made to work a little. How did Monte and Willow come to be here and what's his plan for survival? There's no calls back to Earth, no structure to their existence. Just a sense that things back home have gone wrong. Now I'm not really convinced that this film works all that well. It's opening half hour is intriguing, but the lid being lifted on why Monte is in space, does deflate the story a little. If you've read this far and think 'Yeah I fancy this', then stop here. If not or you've just got time to kill, keep reading. Monte is a prisoner. More than that he's an experiment. Or part of an experiment... he's the experiment. It's not space age rehab, he's not coming back. Neither are Dibs (Juliet Binoche) or Boyse (Mia Goth) who thanks to a jump back in time, are brought into the story along with a few others. Turning into a tense mini society of sexually repressed psychopaths it loses its way. We're just watching, waiting for them to crack. Together they're headed for a black hole ""to see if we can capture its energy"". Sure it's far fetched, but hey why not.I like psychological thrillers, but the characters here are just too thin, too austere to engage with. Monte is the only one with any semblance of substance to him and even then not much. Others like Dibs are downright nuts. A doctor playing god, using the others as pawns in the process. That's where Willow comes in. Left to grow up with only her father in a long forgotten floating space coffin. Now I like bleak arty stuff and there are some great actors here, but bloody hell is it boring. About the only nice things I can say is the sound is good, the art department have really nailed it and whoever was looking after baby Willow (Scarlett Lindsay) on set did a wonderful job. The final act does finally show a little promise. A teenage Willow, the appearance of a second prison vessel. But this like the rest of the plot falls flat. Sometimes uneventful sparse cinema can really work, make you think, lull you into something wonderful. This does not.",High Life
46,andrewroy-04316,An absolutely bizarre and baffling movie with some interesting concepts and visuals but themes that don't cohere,5,24 October 2019,"Well, I can't say that High Life held anything back, and Denis certainly went all in on her directorial vision of a bleak, isolated space mission and examining how that affects people emotionally and sexually. The setting and basic idea are good, but the combination of an extremely slow pace, a plot with few defining events, and the ideas never coming together in a clear way made it an unenjoyable watching experience. There is some nice use of color and pretty visuals in the garden and a handful of space scenes. The idea of how isolation makes people emotionally drained and disconnected is interesting, and the idea of showing how that can manifest sexually isn't a bad one, it's just very unclear what it is supposed to signify. Why did Dibs want to create a baby through artificial insemination and not regular sex? Also if their mission is presumed futile and they'll never make it back, why is she so intent on a baby? Does she ever test herself? The actual mission, getting energy from the black hole, was completely shoved aside all movie. Most of our time is either spent with the prisoners dealing with some sexual or masturbatory situation or doing nothing at all. The nonlinear narrative technique didn't add to the story, as our knowledge that it ends up just being Monte and a baby removes some intrigue from Dibs' experimentation and all intrigue in the mission. Also, the most interesting part of the premise is the way isolation affects their psychology, but we get very little in the way of any of the characters' psychological developments. It is undeniably original and has some interesting moments or visuals, but I have absolutely no idea what the larger themes I'm meant to take away from it are (the one I've read online from Denis is the bond between father and daughter and how they need each other? If that's a big one it's pretty poorly developed as we see no development in their relationship, just her birth and then their final decision to enter the hole), and it's just very slow moving with no tension or intrigue.",High Life

I'm sure the director will make out the screaming baby is a metaphor for a lost soul on the highway of life blah blah blah; however, for me, it just did my head in.

51,gsygsy,Mundane,5,17 May 2019,"Successfully moody movie. It's not particularly clear what's going on but it doesn't matter much, since the characters are a grim bunch and we're not encouraged to like them or identify with them. That's the problem, really. It may be we're being invited to consider even these damaged, damaging souls as worth compassion as any other, which is fair enough, but beyond that it's difficult to know what's at stake. I left the cinema with a feeling that the movie wasn't worth making. It's not as if we don't get clues to meaning. There's a set-up that's revealed to us early on, so this isn't as spoiler -- we're watching criminals paying for their crimes by being put on a prison ship, lives held to be worthless. But this felt to me like a token gesture, a nod towards keeping the audience in the loop, and it weakens the film. Better to know even less, as in, say, LAST YEAR IN MARIENBAD, where the poetry of the piece lies in juxtaposition of powerful images and words. Unfortunately, HIGH LIFE doesn't come anywhere near that.The acting doesn't help.With the exception of Juliette Binoche, a megawatt screen presence, completely compelling whenever she's there, pretty much everyone else is mediocre at best. The leading role is played by Robert Pattinson, whose male-model features are enhanced rather than expunged by his rough 'n' tough character look. His best scenes, spontaneous and genuine, are early on when he's working with a baby. Otherwise he's blank. He's clearly considered a good actor by some people, but in a film with Binoche, who really IS a good actor, the difference in quality really shows.The tech side of the film is good, especially the cinematography and the music. But overall it's disappointingly mundane.",High Life
52,Stay_away_from_the_Metropol,A glorious visionary exercise in meditation & existentialism,9,28 April 2019,"I'm not following the very popular perspective that this movie does not ""accomplish what it sets out to do"" or that it's somewhat aimless. This is what sci-fi is all about, in my opinion...rather than facing familiar themes and tropes, this film challenges you with left field ideas that absolutely require suspension of disbelief - if you are unable to let go of reality, there is a good chance you will not be able to enjoy this visionary wonder.If you can't tell by the trailer, the movie is an absolute visual feast. Every shot, set piece, costume, and light feels meticulously and creatively placed. Every shot is beautiful, if not occasionally striking in the opposite sense. The primary cast all delivered in their respective roles: Pattinson effectively channeling the ex-criminal who seems to have found some sort of peace within his very bleak fate, Mia Goth is completely volatile and unpredictable while maintaining some charm within her mystery, Juliette Binoche was quite hypnotic while effectively slowly eating away at your psyche.A lot of people complain that the film is ""too slow"" or ""nothing happens"". I don't understand what people expect from a movie about a small group of people that are stuck in a small spacecraft for what is intended to be the rest of their lives. Of course it's going to be ""slow"" - there's only so much you can do up there. That's the challenge for the viewer, to feel a bit of what it's like for the characters to go through that experience! That's the idea! With that being said, there ARE a handful of very intense scenes that I was not expecting whatsoever! My jaw certainly dropped a couple of times and I will never forget those sequences.All that aside, I was COMPLETELY intrigued through almost every single sequence in the entire movie. There was always something to be learned or something that takes a bit of time to understand, always something to exercise the brain and keep the viewer trying determine things, or solve puzzles, in a sense. This is the most impressive element of good sci-fi in my opinion - if you have to option to get creative with ideas, then DO IT! Claire Denis DOES! This was my first impression of her work and just based off of this work alone, I certainly consider myself a fan now.Though there were some scenarios and concepts I didn't take anything from personally, there were also a lot in which I did. Everything translated to me into purely existential thoughts, and yes, they are very bleak - but, we are living in an era that many see as incredibly bleak. We are nearing a revolutionary switch which we have never faced before, and it's terrifying to almost everyone. What a fantastic time for a film like this to come out. Bravo.",High Life

55,fciocca,"The beginning is catchy, but the story is very flat and nothing really happens",2,27 December 2019,"I was curious for High Life. First of all because I wanted to see Robert Pattinson in a different role, a more serious one and I was curious to see him acting in a low budget production. The other reason that pushed me to watch it is because I love A24 productions. I think I watched most of their big successes such as The Witch, Hereditary and Midsommar. They are not movies for a mainstream audience, they are usually slow pacing, but with an interesting story and unexpected plot twists. If you love this kind of cinema, you will of course love their releases.The beginning is very catchy, because you don't know what is happening, and the movie little by little uncover all the truth. The concept idea is not bad, even if it is not original. A group of death row inmates, is sent by the government beyond the solar system to do some researches on black holes. The situation will escalate quickly and while we go on, people start to lose their mind and you start to understand that this is simply a suicide mission.I don't know what the movie would like to tell and honestly I cannot see any deeper meaning, any hidden message and this makes me think that this want just to be one of those wannabe philosophical movies, that cannot reach the goal. What you will see is a bunch of random death that are not always explained in the proper way, and one of the worst, boring and disappointing ending of 2019. I don't even know why this movie was released in the first place.The cast is composed by really famous actors such as Juliette Binoche, Robert Pattinson and Mia Goth, but they are not able to deliver a convincing performance, I could not bound with any of the character and even if the movie has just a normal length (2 hours), I could not watch it at once, because it was so boring that I needed to press pause and do something else because I was actually falling asleep.I have to admit that, considering the low budget, visual effects were pretty decent, but this is the only thing that I save about this movie.",High Life
56,themadmovieman,"A bold take on Tarkovsky-esque slow cinema, but struggles to find its feet",7,17 May 2019,"As close to Andrei Tarkovsky's Solaris as modern cinema is likely to get, High Life is an undeniably striking, bold and deeply unsettling sci-fi drama throughout. Unfortunately, while it impresses with its cinematic audacity, the film really struggles to find its feet early on, coming off as a gratuitously provocative arthouse film, rather than something genuinely deep. That said, with strong directing and performances, and a far better final act, High Life proves a memorable, if not rather exhausting watch.Now, slow cinema is always one of the most interesting genres out there, because it requires the very best in directing, acting, screenwriting and everything else to keep you engrossed at every moment. The original Solaris is a great example of how slow cinema can work really well, and can also be really boring. High Life, taking its cues from the Soviet classic, is a bold attempt at pure slow cinema, but it too struggles to keep the intensity and intrigue there at every moment.Starting off with the film's opening two acts, things really don't come together in the way the movie seems to want them to. While its non-linear structure is commendable in creating uncertainty and mystery surrounding the status of the people stuck out here in deep space, the film spends a good hour or so jumping back and forth between characters, time periods, themes and more in a rather disorientating manner.Now, the film is atmospherically speaking a deeply unsettling and mysterious watch, and director Claire Denis does a brilliant job to tie together striking cinematography and top-quality costume and production design together to give this film that piercingly disturbing and strange atmosphere right from the start.However, in slow cinema, an atmospherically striking movie isn't enough, and while High Life does more than enough to intrigue in its first ten minutes, that eeriness feels like it's all style over substance as the first two acts unfold, a problem worsened by the film's gratuitous and unnecessarily graphic use of sex and violence through the first half.As a result, while I was taken aback by the visuals, atmosphere and striking likeness to Solaris, I really found myself struggling to engage with the film's major themes through the opening two acts, with the story taking too many liberties with its more provocative and arthouse-style ideas early on, and giving little focus to developing those main dramatic themes in a more engrossing manner.Fortunately, things change in the final act, which not only takes away the earlier period's gratuitously provocative elements, but also brings far more depth and intrigue to those main themes. All of a sudden, with a significant change of circumstance going into the third act, the concepts of humanity as a species, the reproductive cycle, the ethics of science and the far future all start to hit home, which makes an already atmospherically striking film a thematically powerful one as well.If things had continued the way they had in the first two acts, I would have ultimately called High Life a dull and pretentious film, but it manages to bring together its best ideas in time for an electric final act, which finally delivers on what is not only a brilliant dramatic premise, but a unique and commendably bold cinematic style that isn't used to its full potential early on.Robert Pattinson impresses throughout with a more measured performance than a lot of the more provocative events surrounding his character, and it's that island of calm that keeps a degree of dramatic intrigue in the story through the first two acts. Juliette Binoche also impresses on the other side of the spectrum, really bringing home the more disturbing nature of the story at hand with a deliberately witch-like turn as the ship's medical controller.The supporting cast aren't quite on the same level as the lead duo, partly because the secondary characters don't really get the attention they deserve, but also because they're used more often in the film's more provocative periods, whereas the most powerful and memorable points are almost entirely focused on Pattinson's character.On the whole, there's certainly a lot to say about High Life, and I am delighted to say that it's a bold, audacious modern take on slow cinema. With stunning visuals from beginning to end, as well as excellent directing, the film holds a piercingly unsettling atmosphere throughout, furthered only by the disturbing nature of many of its themes. High Life does struggle to find its feet for the first two-thirds, which can prove frustrating, but once it all comes together in the final act, it proves to be a genuinely powerful and memorable watch.",High Life
57,TheVictoriousV,"I haven't felt so ""beyond the stars"" in a while",8,22 July 2019,"When I reviewed Netflix's The Wandering Earth, I talked about how it revived a ceaselessly campy era of science fiction and how I welcomed it. If you want to be serious, however, another thing we lack lately is slow-paced Tarkovskian sci-fi. Fortunately, Claire Denis' High Life is an example of such ambition.Widely released this spring by A24, High Life is a uniquely presented, uniquely written story with imagery as discomforting as its themes and futuristic vision. Many of these things are integral to great, lasting, prophetic science fiction. It also proves, along with 2017's Good Time (an after-the-fact addition to my 2017 list) that Robert Pattinson is nowhere near as bad as he pretended to be in The Twilight Saga.Pattinson leads the film as a lone astronaut, stuck somewhere in deep space with his infant daughter as his only companion. We learn through flashbacks that he was once part of a crew consisting entirely of death row inmates, sentenced to embark on a suicide mission to a black hole to find the key to infinite energy. One of the lead scientists explains it to a reporter in one of the few Earth-based sequences, which lets us know that this is a publicly known deep-space experiment. I'll take exposition like this over Pattinson's narrations.Pattinson's fellow inmates are a varied collection, most of them turned to monsters as a result of their isolation - they're violent, loud, and addicted to a pleasure unit that crewmembers can use. The cast includes Mia Goth, André Benjamin, and Juliette Binoche as the enigmatic Dr. Dibs, who seems to be more in control of the ship than even the oblivious captain. She keeps the inmates sedated when necessary but also experiments on them, trying to create a healthy child through artificial means. The mission has driven her to obsession.The whole insemination thing has little to do with the ship's mission to the black hole, or the ""man becoming an animal"" stuff. One gets the sense that the movie tries to touch on too many heavy subjects at once - even if it arguably comes together fine near the end and there's room to endlessly interpret how it all connects. (Is there a reason only that one particular crewmember could produce a healthy human child? Why were these final humans allowed to get near the Black Hole unharmed?) There is more to question about the film on a more shallow, logical level. The main spaceship seems to be in need of more security personnel, for instance.The most essential thing, however, is how completely and utterly isolating High Life is. Critics wonder why we didn't get to see these people's pasts and get a sense of how they behaved before driven to beast-like tendencies. As I see it, the viewer gets to feel like the new inmate, trapped with humans who lost their humanity long ago. The retro score and ever-present humming of the ship's engines add to the feeling, as do the scenes which involve spacesuits and feature, let's say, Kubrick-style audio.While rated R, the content in this movie could easily justify an NC-17 rating. I often award points to films with daring imagery, but there ought to be a point to it (my brother once showed me the Vomit Gore trilogy and was surprised I didn't much care for it). We do get that here, as the bodily fluids shown are mostly those that concern the creation of life, which is significant (there is some blood as well, including one of the most horrifying depictions of traveling past a black hole in any science fiction story).I admire science fiction that disconnects me from the rest of the world for a while, trapping me in a prison-like space, which in turn is traversing unexplored territory beyond the dying stars (this has previously been achieved by such works as 2001 and the new Twin Peaks). And as I said, the movie begs to be analyzed and contemplated. Thinking about the logic of, say, the space mission itself admittedly makes this movie a little worse, but the visuals, themes, and otherworldly atmosphere have been on my mind ever since I watched it.When I had finished, it was like waking up from a long, deep slumber full of unthinkable dreams.",High Life

But, oh, yeah, they didn't do any of that.When the movie starts to dig more into the flashbacks (which are honestly 70% of the movie) it goes nuts. It becomes just a weird fetishly porn. With rapes, and sex with objects, and people trapped in bed at night (so they can be rapped...? idk).There are SO many weird stuff that come and never come back. Like, what was the deal with those bodies in the beginning anyways? Cause, like, we saw the crew mostly dying and being disfigured (some even in space!) in the process, so how are there bodies? The dudes in the train, which I've already talked about it. At some point they say the doctor has a... plastic pussy (???)... like... why? What's the point?! I also never got what was the whole mission about, just to go into a black hole? Or to produce a space baby? Both...?The acting is fine tho. Pattison is pretty good in it, actually everyone is ok with what they had to work with I would say.Oh, before I forget. What the hell was that ending right? Just the cake's cherry.That's about it for High Life, it's a movie that if you try hard enough you could see how it could be a good concept movie (the first minutes, and some of the last are interesting), but a hour long soft porn in the middle prevented that from happening.3,5/10",High Life

Yes, it is Denis's first English-language film, and yes, it is set in space, but it's a science fiction film in name only, and has more in common with 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) and Solyaris (1972) than with anything in the Star Trek or Star Wars franchises. And just for the record, the guy from Twilight has developed one of the most eclectic recent CVs of any actor in Hollywood. The long and short of it is that Denis has not sold out, and High Life is as multiplex-friendly as anything in her oeuvre (which is to say, not in the slightest), covering several of her more familiar themes - the darker aspects of desire; the notion of being an outcast; parenthood; the inescapability of death; the beauty of the human body; the relationship between violence and sexuality. The presence of Robert Pattinson will probably draw in a lot of unsuspecting folks, who will have no idea what to make of Denis's slowly paced existential musings, resulting in a slew of ""worst film ever"" reviews. But although it's not Denis's best (that remains either Beau travail (1999) or Les salauds (2013)), it's a fascinatingly poetic and original film that is utterly uncategorisable - a space thriller about a mission collapsing in on itself; an ecological allegory positing that we don't have a huge amount of time left to save the planet; an analysis of the psychological ramifications of long-term incarceration; an erotic skin flick obsessed with bodily fluids; a metaphor for the perils of imperialism; a fable on the subject of paternity; a story about loneliness and grief; a literalisation of the premise that no amount of evolution, philosophy, or esotericism can ever change the fact that we're biological organisms controlled by our sexual yearnings and impulse to procreate - desire will always trump the social contract; we can place as much artificial limitation on our carnality as we want, but ultimately, desire will betray us.Like I say, very multiplex-friendly.Deep space. On an unnamed ship marked only with the number #7, Monte (Pattinson) lives alone with his baby daughter Willow (Scarlett Lindsey). However, this wasn't always the case, and as the film begins, Monte is releasing the bodies of his deceased crewmates into the void of space. How this situation came to pass is revealed via an achronological flashback narrative structure. A group of death row were offered a pardon if they undertook a mission to investigate the viability of the ""Penrose Process"" - a theory developed by Sir Roger Penrose whereby energy could be extracted from the area close to a black hole. However, the groups' de facto leader, Dr. Dibs (an ethereal Juliette Binoche oozing uninhibited sexuality from every pore), a criminal herself, is using the journey to conduct biological experiments on the crew; harvesting the men's semen and attempting to artificially inseminate the women. Monte, however, refuses to comply, arguing that his chastity gives him strength. His obstinacy fascinates Dibs, who determines to get a sample from him by any means necessary.High Life, written in French by Denis and her regular writing partner Jean-Pol Fargeau in 2013 and translated into English by Geoff Cox, begins with pseudo-Edenic shots of lush vegetation, before slowly revealing we're seeing a garden on a spaceship, surrounded by and subservient to technology. We then hear a baby crying. This opening, mixing vegetation, technology, and biology, signals both the film's tone and demonstrates the economy of Denis's visual language, telling us much of what we need to know about the upcoming film. Denis and director of photography Yorick Le Saux employ similarly precise storytelling tools in shooting everything on the spaceship on HD video, whereas the few scenes on Earth are shot on 16mm - this gives the space scenes a sleek polished sheen, whilst the Earth material looks grainy and gritty, more lived in, setting up an instant visual contrast.Thematically, rather unexpectedly, the film has a lot in common with First Reformed (2017) ; both deal with the looming end of existence; both examine the possibility of finding hope amidst the oncoming cataclysm; both see the human race as essentially not worth saving; both focus on a spiritual character facing a crisis of faith - in First Reformed, that crisis concerns Fr. Toller's Catholicism, whereas in High Life it's Monte's belief in the importance of self-discipline and chastity.Of course, on a more prosaic level, the film is obsessed with sexuality. Fluids are a recurring motif throughout, whether the blood that several characters shed, the sperm with which Dibs is obsessed, the oil that keeps the ship's systems running, the water that nourishes the garden and that keep the crew alive. Speaking of fluid, perhaps the film's most haunting image is a shot of one character lactating; her body producing nourishment for a baby she can't feed, as Dibs has taken it from her, the milk running down her body going to waste. Interestingly enough, at the film's world première in Toronto, this scene sparked a considerable number of walkouts, almost every single one of which was male. Make of that what you will.The subject of fluids is introduced from the onset. One of the first things we hear Monte saying is telling Willow that even if it is recycled, one should never eat one's own faeces or drink one's own urine, as such behaviour is ""taboo"". If we accept that the ship's garden is Eden, then Monte and Willow are our Adam and Eve, and, as we all know, what comes next in Genesis is temptation and desire. Thus Monte's emphasis on taboo in this opening scene becomes ironic given that later in the film, he will come face to face with an even more controversial taboo.In terms of problems, the film will be far too abstruse for some. Denis obviously intended for High Life to be esoteric, and she's unconcerned with CGI spectacle or any of the tropes we've seen rehashed a million times in other sci-fi movies. For some, however, the film will cross the line from esotericism to impenetrability, with Denis allowing the socio-political themes overwhelm the film's identity as popular entertainment, refusing to explicitly reveal its fundamental meaning. And for those more used to films that openly reveal themselves without the audience having to put in much effort, High Life will prove too abstract.In this sense, Denis's litany of themes does come across as a little haphazard, as she jumps around fairly randomly between them. This results in something of a thematic pile-up, which, by definition, can feel like a bit of a dead-end. I don't agree with people who say the film ""has no point"", but I can certainly see from where such criticism could arise, as Denis leaves several ideas frustratingly incomplete. Another issue is that the journey of #7 is never presented in any way urgently, meaning there's rarely tension, as life on ship moves along at its own lethargic pace. And I have to admit, at times my attention began to wander.Nevertheless, High Life is a fascinating film that fits right into Denis's oeuvre. Although it recalls the clinical detachment of 2001 and the psychological intensity of Solaris, High Life is very much its own animal. Asking questions about our inability to recognise the oncoming extinction, it offers a savage and pessimistic corrective to the idealism of films such as Interstellar (2014) and The Martian (2015). Positing that mankind is a monster driven by its desires isn't going to earn Denis legions of new fans, but for those of us who were already on board, there's much to be relished here.",High Life
61,anthonyjlangford,High Life aims Low,5,28 April 2019,"Most reviewers fall into two camps. That High Life is High Art or High Pretension. It's a little of both, or a lot, depending on your viewpoint.This review will target other issues. Firstly I had a problem with the baby's lingering genitalia shot. If this film was directed by a man there would be outrage. Being directed by a woman doesn't make it any better. It's unnecessary to the story. This baby will grow into a child, a teenager, a woman. Did she give her consent? No. Will she be happy with it as an adult? Who can say but I fail to see why it was necessary. The toilet/urine shot comes afterwards and doesn't utilize nudity, therefore making the genital shot redundant. Yet there it is. I have no problem with nudity in films, nor sex, even explicit. This shot wasn't right.The major problem is the unrealistic sci-fi setting and production design. It looks like a student film shot in someones house. Dark Star looks like slick in comparison. I appreciate that as an art-house director Denis wasn't interested in that aspect of presentation but if you want people to believe in your world you have to make some effort. Plenty of directors have made art-house films set in space. Think Tarkovsky's Solaris. Two monitors on a desk and a crappy air conditioner doesn't really cut it as a functional spaceship.In Denis's version of space, no one floats. You go out the door and drop. It's obvious and destroys any illusion. There's clearly some budget involved as the star field/black hole shots are top notch, even beautiful. If you don't want to have lack of gravity in space then don't show it. It seems Denis simply couldn't be bothered.The ship also has two escape pods, or independent vehicles. Why would a ship so small, with a cargo of criminals have such vehicles? You have to have some sort of grounding in reality. There's many of these insults to the audiences' intelligence and expectations.The actors are of course, fantastic. Mia Goth is a real talent. They seem to believe in Denis's vision, even if it's flawed. Binoche especially stands out, though her 'solo' scene is both unique and unintentionally laughable.With a little more effort, Denis could have pulled this off. Its themes of sexuality and isolation are interesting and worthwhile. She simply couldn't be bothered to round out a fully cohesive world and the film suffers from amateurishness because of it.",High Life
62,Lewis_Heather787,This is why science fiction is so special !!!,8,4 May 2019,"Firstly I am not that shocked at the incredibly low rating on Imdb this film has because you have got to be a real lover of science fiction films to at least appreciate the film for it tries to achieve. Even if it doesn't fully to do for everyone.Its one of the those films you're either going to get it and be on board with straight away or you're be bored for most of the entirety, which I can understand. However for myself I am in the first camp, I bought into the story and the characters straight away.The most praise has to go to Claire Denis, this is one of the most mesmerising and beautiful science fictions that I can remember. Definitely has the feel of ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and ""Interstellar"". From a technical standpoint this film is a true marvel, especially the use of the shorter frame that the film was shot. Couple the fantastic directing along with the cinematography, production design and limited special effects......everything for me just works and is perfection. Personally its everything I want from a science fiction film.The other big standout is Robert Pattinson who has managed to completely turn around his career and transform himself into one of the best actors currently working. For years the ""Twilight"" stench couldn't leave him, as soon as you saw him you were reminded of those films. But now with ""Good Time"" and this film, along with others, they have shown his true potential as proper actor to be taken seriously. This film only improves his resume for me, as he takes ahold of this film right from the get go. He is brilliant in the film, especially in regard of showing a real arc in his character over the time shifts this film does.(Its no surprise he has attracted the likes of Christopher Nolan for his next film and rumours about being the next Batman).Although I really enjoyed the film for the story ambiguity, character/acting, directing, cinematography, production design and special effects. This film is not perfect and there are a couple of problems. Firstly the film feels a lot longer that it actually is. Its runtime is less than 2 hours although it feels a lot longer than that due to the films pacing which is very slow. Especially the middle of the film feels very slow and the story seems a bit stagnant. That leads me into the other negative, the story doesn't really have a big punch at any point really, it sort of just goes along until the very end. Its as if the story/film needed a twist to really elevate it, give it a change of pace.Overall though I really enjoyed it, although I can appreciate why someone wouldn't like. As I said its one of those films you either love or hate, I think probably one of the biggest problems for most people will be the amount of ambiguity in the film, which opens up many more questions than it answers. I personally love that in film. Its very good 80% out of 100 or 8 out of 10, this is why I love science fiction films, the possibilities are endless.",High Life
63,cgearheart,Dark but rewarding morality tale,9,22 April 2019,"I had heard quite a great buzz about Claire Denis' space odyssey ""High Life"" and was super excited for it. The sad thing was that I was hearing mostly negative things about the film and how boring and pretentious it was. I still clenched my excitement but stayed cautious and opened minded that it could be a doozy.
After watching it, I knew it was a good idea not to doubt it. It was mostly what I came to expect but with a bit more. A dark, tricky, and unflinchingly sexual morality piece playing deeply on both sexual desire and the need to populate and settle. The film was what I felt like a true science fiction film because it felt close to science and stranger than fiction.
The cinematography was nothing short of breathtaking, especially with the shots of space. The musical score is the best I've heard since Hereditary last year and the characters were very complex and interesting. Though I praise this movie, I definitely don't recommend it to everyone. To say that it's acquired taste is a little bit of an understatement.A-",High Life
64,foxtografo,"Uninteresting, unpolished, boring, pointless.",3,28 May 2019,"I love Sci-fi, for which I decided to have my own opinion about this movie that seems one of those love or hate ones by seeing the ratings and reviews...
I'll stand on the side of the ones that didn't like it.
For a sci-fi movie where the characters spend the whole time (2 long hours of movie) in a box shaped spaceship, there's very (extremely little) detail on how their system works and what they do to keep it going, and what and how they will do whatever they mean to do or be doing (this sound weird, but the plot was pretty vague to me).
There were a lot of unrealistic details, like a crappy space suit that doesn't even seal the helmet, ridiculous floating in space, long periods of time past in a blink with no effect whatsoever on the characters and many, many details that are too long to list. Everything looked very cheap and poorly worked out on the writing.
The spaceship design is not only very poor on the outside, the inside is very simplistic and doesn't look like something that would sustain people for years.
There are a bunch of uninteresting and/or annoying characters that hate each other and wouldn't survive in any situation for a long (or even short) period of time, so what's the point of sending them on a mission that lasts years? If it was to get rid of them, it could be done simpler. The hierarchies are unclear or just not really developed or thought, as unpolished as the spaceship aspect.
I didn't think there were any great performances, maybe because of the poorly written characters, there wasn't much to do by the actors.
The cinematography wasn't great, but maybe because the settings were poorly designed too (even if it is a low budget, it can be done with imagination), so there wasn't much to be shown beautifully.
The very simple and pointless story had a very open, lazy and unimaginative ending. If I wanted to imagine the ending I would have sit and imagine the whole movie. It's been done before enough times and it's tiring.
The Ending was the only thing to save this movie and it didn't.
I can't think of much I liked about this movie, just a couple scenes, a couple shots, that's it. Doesn't worth two hours of watching.
I don't think there's anything that anyone would be looking for on a movie and will find here. No one to recommend this to.
Maybe Pattinson fans would like two hours of him...",High Life

70,tigerfish50,Dead-end Life,1,27 December 2019,"Claire Denis must enjoy depicting dead-end communities. Just as her 2009 film 'White Material' portrayed the final spasms of European colonialism in Africa, the space travelers of 'High Life' have nowhere to go. On a spaceship set which resembles abandoned municipal offices, a crew of former death row prisoners have been dispatched on a mission to a black hole beyond the solar system. As their purposeless journey unfolds, a female medical researcher carries out perverse experiments on her shipmates until trouble breaks out among these human laboratory rats.The story, acting, direction and production values would all be unacceptable on a micro-budget project. None of the proceedings have any rationality, even though Denis spends inordinate amounts of time telling her dismal tale in a fragmented narrative. To call her pacing slow would be deceptive - it's congealed slow motion. To portray the script as disjointed would be equally misleading - it's turgid gobbledygook. To describe the concept as cerebral would be outright dishonesty - it's merely vacuous pretension.

71,Slarkshark,Long Space Journey with Uninteresting Low Lifes,5,5 April 2021,"I've seen some high ratings, and a lot of low ratings for 'High Life'. I'll meet them in the middle and settle on five. Plainly put, this is not an entertaining film, and there is the sense that it is definitely striving to be an artistic one. It succeeds if that is it's sole purpose, because other than that it's just depressing with very little substance, which in the end leaves you asking why for many reasons. It feels like a movie that you wake up to that's playing on the TV at 3 AM after falling asleep on the couch for hours.I'm all for space movies, and sci-fi in general, so I had to give this a shot. However, there is actually very little space other than a few neat scenes with the black hole. It's more so a drama amongst the crew of criminals; then flashing back and forth in time showing Robert Pattinson raising his daughter. Speaking of Pattison, he's taken quite a few of these off the beaten track roles where he's been able to display his range which have undoubtedly led to his current blockbuster roles, so good for him. He is fine in this, but nothing he does really stands out, like most of the film. All the other characters besides Andre 3000 are supremely weird and despicable.",High Life

Far from it. Claire Denis has a brain that travels at the speed of light.Monte(Robert Pattinson) is the lone surviving member of 7, an exploration ship that becomes untrackable when it departs our solar system. Criminals, lawless young men and women serving life sentences, not astronauts, make up this crew. It's no wonder that they end up killing each other. Trained astronauts would have recognized that the objective of this ambitious undertaking: To harness energy from the nearest black hole was a one-way trip. Trained astronauts would have recognized the machinations of sending a reprobate fertility doctor. Dibs(Juliette Binoche), an ex-con, guilty of double filicide, has the job of artificially inseminating the women, so their offspring can extend the mission long after they're dead. Unfortunate for Monte, his space-bound cellmates, especially the female ones, get knocked off, not knocked up, leaving him with a unforeseen moral dilemma until it's too late. If Monte knew what he would face later, the last man alive would have found a less lethal way of immobilizing Mink(Claire Tran), as it turns out, his precious crewmate, and bodily resource, when she attacks the fertility doctor. He realizes his mistake too late.Dibs, perhaps, knows before anybody else aboard the 7, that since they're no longer in our solar system, the rules of their old world cease being applicable.What does the word ""crime"" mean in a universe without language, without laws, and without formal religion?""Toto, I don't think we're in Kansas anymore,""Monte, a self-styled monk, a celibate, refuses to provide the doctor with a sample. In retaliation, Dibs puts the abstainee under sedation and assaults him. Boyse(Mia Goth), who practices a strict daily regimen of feminine hygiene, to the doctor's chagrin, gets impregnated without her consent, incapacitated by the same sleeping gas as Monte. Dibs, described as a ""shaman of..."", is more than that; she is playing god. The fertility doctor fills the vacuum of spirituality with empiricism.What is sin?Dibs doesn't stick around to find out. Her job is finished after all of her young female subjects reject motherhood through self-immolation. Nansen(Agata Buzek), the pilot, is murdered by Boyse, before she gets the chance to kill herself. Boyse, the reluctant mother, flies Nansen's ship into the black hole. Nobody told her that she was being used as a guinea pig, and acts accordingly.Before Dibs steps outside the airlock, Monte learns that Willow, an immaculate conception of sorts, aided by science, the ideological go-between, is a byproduct of his own flesh and blood. Dibs offers no apologies. Like other gods before her, the fertility doctor had to carry out a master plan for the human race, and did it by any means necessary. Willow, you could say, was made in the fertility doctor's own image. Afterwards, standing at the hatch, moonwalking regalia bunched at his feet, Monte, the first-time father, flagellates himself, because it dawns on him, the moral quandary that awaits him when Willow matures.""Willow, where are you hiding now?"" the father coos softly; it's a snippet of the original song ""Willow"" by Tindersticks' frontman Stuart Staples that plays over the closing credits. It's an emotional space, not physical. They're on the 7, father and daughter; a world within itself, with no place to hide.Monte's crewmates are long-deceased before Willow(Jessie Ross) grows up. They only knew her as an infant. Claire Denis, however, employs a pointed flash-forward when Boyse and the other potential mothers were still alive. Monte, unknowingly, musses up the long hair of some mysterious female head lying atop his chest while at repose in a dreaming state. It's Willow. The girl, of course, should be sleeping by herself, in the bed across from his, but this teenager, born in galactic captivity, is oblivious to the boundaries that western civilization once imposed on men and women.This is provocative stuff. Not my interpretation at all. It's there on the screen. ""High Life"" is not a slow movie"".She is a de facto alien.The father knows Willow's unique position of being, in essence, a human lab animal. She could be a beagle. Monte wants Willow to be his daughter for a little while longer, But, alas the bedsheet... The father looks at the young woman, suddenly, a stranger. The girl's self-exploratory fingers bear the mark of arrived motherhood. Monte's calm quietude about this body change and the absence of panic in his daughter's eyes suggest that they had ""the talk"". Unlike Dae-su(Choi Min-Sik) in Park Chan-wook's ""Oldboy"", who has a hypnotist erase the old man's lover's true identity from his mind, Willow is untethered from the codification of orthodox love mandated by earthbound laws. As a baby, for all we know, ""taboo"" was Willow's first word, since Monte repeats it so frequently. The father speaks in code; he's not concerned about his daughter eating recycled waste products. That's not the taboo. Monte knew, from the outset, that their parent/child dynamic had the potentiality of evolving into a post-prelapsarian relationship.Remember.They're the only human animals left alive.They escaped earth's sixth extinction.Monte tells her: ""At least it is for me, but not for you,"" in regard to...among blood relatives. But as long as they remain on the 7, the rules of the game apply as they did in their own solar system. It's the garden. Willow, as a baby, feeds Monte a strawberry; she places the small fruit in his mouth. Apples don't grow in this greenhouse, but the fruits and vegetables that Monte picks and grinds up has the quality of applesauce.She's older now.Willow spies on her father as he disinfects himself among the foliage after returning from another ship, whose passengers on the 9 were of the four-legged variety. It's Sputnik come full-circle; the last dogs in space. Theoretically, Willow understands that her feelings of desire are wrong. 7 still gets transmissions from earth. She experiments with prayer. Willow presses her hands together, wanting to feel guilt, willing to repent. But it's all a concept to her; she has no first-hand experience with other people. Monte is the only person she has ever known.Claire Denis, let it be said, is brilliant.""Do you know what god you're praying to?"" Monte asks.Willow doesn't know. How could she?Like Bowman(Keir Dullea), the astronaut, in Stanley Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", Monte and Willow need to evolve. To achieve this, they walk away from the garden. They're going to create Rat's Child. ""Rats"" spelled backwards is Star, as in Star Child, the fetus that hovers over earth while Richard Strauss' ""Also Sprach Zarthrusta"" plays over the soundtrack.Does anybody realize this?Rat is how Monte describes Willow's teeth. Willow is not offended. She describes rats as being ""incredibly intelligent creatures"".It's a compliment.Instead of a monolith, it's an accretion disc in the black hole that serves as a marker towards evolvement. They step into the yellow light, an alien light, where...""High Life"" is a work of crystalline vision.This woman's work.""You're coming with me/Through the aging, the fearing, the strife""",High Life

I was completely wrong ofcourse, High Life is an excellently crafted philosophical sci-fi drama which explores many themes in its 113 minute running time.Robert Pattinson's journey from a franchise actor to a prominent star in indie films has been complete. He gave his career best performance in Good Time and comes close to matching it in this film. Veteran actress Juliette Binoche dons the unusual role of a horny scientist and Suspiria fame Mia Goth plays the role of an erratic convict.

The second thing I noticed was his space suit appeared to be made out of a cotton jumper. It looked wrong. There were also no stars in space.
Then he dropped a screwdriver in space. Why was it not tethered to him? Surely someone working outside in space alone would know better?
Robert Pattinson's character swore a lot, to the baby.
They have gravity onboard, but didn't explain how. I suppose they must also have baby food, nappies and they had a crib. Why I have no idea. Just because they needed it for the film to happen?
He wastes valuable space suits on dead corpses. But there was no reason to waste the suits. How they died was not explained.
The computer monitors text screens looked like they came from the 1970s.
It feels like a low-budget student film, done with just one cast member, shot in a single location studio, with a broadcast quality camera from the early 2000's, that were not upto 4k standards.
Even the editing was bad, with shots hanging on a second or two longer than they should have, with us watching a wall. Black flash frames left in from splicing. Jarring Jump cuts and shots of legs which don't add anything. This 1hour 53 minute movie could easily have been 80 minutes.
The pace is slow. No music, no ambient engine noise. No beeps from computers. To say there is no atmosphere in space would be an understatement.

107,nikxatz,Space is weird and humans are weirder,7,29 April 2019,"High Life. I wanted to watch this film for 3 main reasons. 1st) A24 is the most consistent and inspiring production company right now. 2nd) Robert Pattison showed a llot of maturity with his acitng in Good Time (agian by A24, good film) and I wnated to see more of his acting skills. 3rd)It looked interesting and generally I tend to like such hardcore sci-fi films. Despite my high expectations, I saw the feeedback it received and the opinions were divided with most haters calling it a bunch of wasted time and others calling it a great film about loneliness and existencialism. My view...I am kind of in between. I thought that High Life had a lot ot say about the human condition and how sex and violence is what we are. We are seeds seaking for a person to have an interaction with, to look and talk to, to have sex with, to connect to, to be pleased and feel better in these cages that we are locked in. High Life wanted to be about humans and not clearly about space. It showed that the human nature is inescapable even in space. It is about the same and the same things that we do everyday, the sickness and cruelty of being alone and of desperately searching for a ""medicine"", a solution, like a sex-machine, or a friend, or a thing to make you forget that you are a prissoner in your own self. This is what I got from the film and High Life nailed at being an open film with various interprations and intriguing themes. The characters had a look of consant tragedy and sadness and although only 2 of them had an arc, you could feel how all the crew felt and it brought a weird feeling to my mind. Other than that, most of it is simply and nicely shot, the colour in this film is great and vibrant nad the cinematography is well-done. There is a weird sexs equence and even if I did not really liked the placement of that scene, the way it look was so sick that I approved it. The design of the spaceship is neat too. To me it either symbolizes a cage or a box where escaping is impossible or even a block of flats considering that even though it is film is space, the actions of the characters bring out their humanity. And the greatest of all, Robert Pattison is phenomenal. He is emotional and gives every bit of him in every single scene. I would probably be bored in a lot of scenes if it was not for him. He also sings a song called ""Willow"" and it is really warming and slow and tender but at the same time dark and sick and really fits the tone of the film. The acting from the others was satisying as well, although the girl in the 3rd act did not do such a good job, but it was not a huge grape.The disadvantages were there too and made me quiestion about the film. So, all of it does not really stick well. I mean, one scene is this and the other is antoher thing. It is difficult to connect to the story when it is so weird and does not have a balance. It is just that it did not have the right flow and felt weird and at times kind of stupid. Some shots feel ""off"" and some 'disturbing"" scenes pointless. Some characters are really weird and you expect to see why they are like that and why they feel this way...but no!I can actually see why people hate or gat angry with it. But, it has a lot of interesting things to talk about it and praise.The result is a weird, sex-oriented, head-scratching and thought-provoking piece of cinema that is what it is. Just like entering a black hole. You enter it with not knowing where oyu will end up...end you end up don't knowing where you've been.Interesting, isn't it?

Robert Pattinson, Mia Goth and Andre 3000 give fantastic performances here and give the film a well-needed boost quality wise. The other performances were a bit of a mixed bag. Juliette Binoche is a good actress but some of her line delivery was overly monotone for some reason. I also wish that Andre 3000 got more screen time as he was kinda underutilised here. I think the main problem is that I wish that this film was handled by a different director. The scenes themselves weren't bad but the way the film is structured felt jarring.The film has no set rhythm and as such the film kinda felt like a mish-mash of different science fiction films. Granted there were some great sequences in the film but it was a bit hard to get invested at times. Claire Denis has a good handle of the thematic elements but her directorial style wasn't distinct enough to elevate the film as a whole. The film at times feels like a sci-fi epic trapped in a cardboard box. I feel like I'm being too harsh on this film. For all its faults, it's ambition and themes is what elevates it.

Pattinson, of Twilight fame, does an exceptional job of playing the flawed protagonist. There is enough practicality in the script (including vivid displays of taboo body fluids) to where you don't have to suspend disbelief too much, but also enough mystery to where you can explore your own contentions at movie's end.My only complaint is that some of the characterization is sloppy and underdeveloped, especially motivations and manifestations.High Life isn't a movie for everyone.

Because if the story was just laid out in linear fashion, it would be pretty flimsy. Trouble is that although our curiosity is certainly piqued in terms of backstory, we get nothing satisfying other than the trite ""we were the cast off's of society"" nonsense. Time skips of months, and years are just interspersed with backstory in a way that is absurd. Add to that a completely needless soft-core solo-porn scene with once titan of acting Juliette Binoche, and you'll be remarking that the award for prosthetic should go to the journeyman who crafted the most over-the-top bush committed to celluloid in decades. Ok, I understand there is realism... we have to believe that they are on a ship where water is scarce and shaving is not an option, but if you have respect for the female body, don't flash it at us while the woman is riding a dildo machine... show it in a tasteful scene where issues of privacy among passengers is laid out for the audience to consider. I mean, here's a genuine artsy question to ask: in a zero gravity prison (yeah, they make up an excuse for gravity to exist, but let's conceded it's at lease REDUCED gravity...) where intercourse is verboten and the ships doctor is going full-on jungle bush queen, do the women wear bras, or not? It's an honest question about the female body, women's lib. (Just a generation ago that women were burning their bras in acts of self-liberation, in the pre-judgemental, pre-consumer-brainwashed era of humanist ideals.) But instead of exploring those questions of an intimate, personal nature, we get a dildo machine with red lights (all that is missing is a bucket on a chain and they can re-enact flash dance!) This film claims to be high art, but in my opinion it's garbage. In the ""making of"" bonus on the DVD, there is a still of the screenplay. If you pause it and actually read it, the language is what you'd expect to find in those grocery store pulp paperbacks with pictures of shirtless men that look like Fabio on the cover and only the thinnest claim to literary merit. Everything in the space sequences that is meant to build tension has been done before. Black holes? See Interstellar. Encounter with derelict full of feral animals who were being experimented on? See Ad Astra. Existential questions about isolation in space? See Moon. In fact, Moon is pretty much everything that this film pretends to be. But do yourself a favor and skip High Live.",High Life

118,chilversedward,Deep space dross,2,26 September 2019,"This film garnered some good reviews from quite a few newspapers and film reviewers.
Frankly I have no idea why. There is no plot line to speak of particularly, the characters are boring and seem to have no presence or direction and I couldn't care less what happened to them twenty minutes into the film. I think Robert Pattinson is a very good actor and he did a great job of being a disaffected spaceman. There's been a few comparisons to Solaris and 2001 which is totally unfounded, imho both these films were great and highly watchable and left an impression. Highlife was almost unwatchable to me and left me thinking nothing except that was rubbish and thank god it's finished.

120,jacobnunnally,Boring,2,8 April 2019,"Saw this at the Angelika with a good movie buddy. He said critics were really into this movie so I thought yeah, let's go!This is an ugly, boring, convoluted movie without a single milligram of charm. The leading actor is Robert Pattinson - a handsome, young, dynamic actor. It would not have mattered who played the leading role because all he did was stare at people in a melancholy way and had very few lines. I myself could have done as well. What I'm saying is the movie didn't play to the actor's strengths.The movie was ugly and claustrophobic. Everything is inside, in a grey, boring motif. Gross. That gets pretty old after a while. No variety, no color, no exploration, nothing interesting or captivating.Also here we've got the laziest ending I can say that I've ever seen -- the movie just ends. Since there isn't really a plot, I guess that's fine, but it just seemed like the producers said ""OK guys we ran out of money so let's just wrap it up here, we're done."" Unbelievable.Also, this film is pretentious beyond belief -- it thinks really, really highly of itself as a philosophical masterpiece but is just rehashed garbage from previous sci fi movies. Big deal.I am not exaggerating when I write that this is the worst movie I've seen in several years. It was breathtakingly awful, with no plot or character development to speak of. It was lazy, pointless, ugly, and stupid.I think giving it a 2 out of 10 is being charitable. Save your money and watch grass grow for an hour and a half.",High Life

122,zeionara,art ? science & philosophy,7,16 April 2019,"An example of movie which is based on smart idea as well as on expressing this with original visual and audial approaches. However, this picture is too relies on assumption that this idea is enough to make a good movie. Surely, it is not interesting to watch a dull movie, but it should not be forgotten to put a lot of attention on the visual components. As for me, that fact has definitely not been enough evaluated in production, possibly because of small budget - the colors are too gray-like, frame is not wide enough, exterior is boring and exposition is not attracting. However, there are few moments where situation is being tried to become fixed via uncommon techniques which are somehow rarely seen in movies. There are movies having as to speak not brightest picture (mother! for example or the pigeon sat on a branch and thought about being), but they have individual special characteristic(s) (fast shifting from gray shades and slow motion to bright splashes and action; consituation and illustration of fundamental paradoxes in stream of everyday life) which in connection with this grayness formulate a perfect composition, as a result picture becomes watchable - this composition I haven't noticed in reviewed title.
The movie which I thought about while watching this was 'Human, space, time and human' - these two are very similar, but the last is more boring.
So, as a consequence - I wouldn't recommend this movie for watching and rather try to find another candidate. But, if you have some time to think about Universe and place of a human inside it or you just like movies about space - you could try this.",High Life
123,Deathstryke,A journey to nowhere,3,3 June 2019,"Watching 'High Life' was like traipsing through a post-modern art exhibit. You know the type of thing. Long black corridors lit with neon strip lights, illuminating grainy images of naked people masturbating with fruit. The kind of art that illicits raised eyebrows, wrinkled noses and puzzled tilts of the head before you shuffle off to the next monstrosity.I'm a sucker for cool visuals, and the unusual premise about death row inmates who agree to take part in a space mission in exchange for their lives had, I thought, potential. Unfortunately there was precious little else to absorb from the full 110 minutes that we don't already see in the 2 minute trailer.Aside from some haunting, austere visuals and a tense, oppressive atmosphere, there is absolutely nothing to engage with. The plot is little more than a loose thread from which the director hangs a series of vague and 'provocative' brain farts about human sexual impulse, violence and reproduction. The catalytic character in all of this is Juliette Binoche's Dibs, an over-sexed scientist who seems bafflingly preoccupied with harvesting the semen of the male crew members and inseminating one of the younger females to achieve a perfect viable fetus. Why, is never clear. We don't know if this was a mission given to her by the space program, or a twisted personal obsession. It does, however, set up some bizarre, grotesque set pieces involving sleep rape and a turkey baster.Another conceit in all of this nonsense, is that none of the crew are permitted to have sex with one another and must instead relieve their frustrations in a specialized masturbation chamber, introduced with an indulgent scene of Dibs riding a mechanical dildo while ominous synth chords rumble in the background. It feels so incongruous and artificial that it becomes impossible to take any of it seriously and whatever subtext or ideas Claire Denis was attempting to provoke were lost on me.The editing doesn't aid comprehension. Events are revealed in fragments, hopping fitfully between past and present with no clear visual cues to signal change of time.All the characters aboard the doomed vessel, with the exception of a sweet cuddly baby, are soulless robots with no likable traits and no real arc.
The dialogue is sparse and weirdly obtuse. Binoche sometimes sounds like she doesn't quite understand the words that are coming out of her mouth. In one scene she casually boasts about her crime to the other inmates, in another she's crying about it. It makes no sense.There is no structure, no climax, no resolution, just a vain concept that goes nowhere.",High Life
124,kikoydaba3,High Life is not your exploration-centered sci-fi cinema,8,23 June 2019,"Despite being sci-fi, High Life manages to be more earthly, a film about prison life than scientific exploration. High Life is claustrophobic and enigmatic. With a non-linear script it forces you on a visceral and intellectual journey showing characters with human needs. Robert Pattinson is brilliant and sympathetic as Monte. Jailed for murder, Monte is among a group of criminals sent on a journey to space as guinea pigs for an experiment harnessing energy from a black hole. Pattinson's nuanced performance carries the film in every aspect from being a father figure to conversations with his fellow actors about life stories. Juliette Binoche portrays the grayest character whose actions are due to guilt. The score is haunting, befitting of the claustrophobia staged by director Claire Denis.High Life, ultimately, does not reach its peak potential, wandering thematically from being a prison film to sci-fi exploration.8/10",High Life

Why are they, wherever they are? Why, after the first hour, was I still there?It never really makes sense. The characters never become less than repugnant. But, if you stay to the end, and I'd urge you to stay to the end, something important and moving makes its way out of the interesting but unpleasant black hole that 'High Life' is, but then isn't. It is a serious movie that would be hard to recommend. A serious, complex movie. It's intelligent grotesqueness hard on the eye and heart. But, one that supplies a moving resolution to what the audience just experienced. For that, it is a movie you almost have to recommend. But, only to a movie lover.

129,sagniknath,A potentially engaging premise with some scenes of brilliance that nevertheless feels not fully concluded,7,19 April 2019,"The main hook for me in going to a select screening of High Life was a chance to see Robert Pattison in a Sci Fi movie about a space ship hurtling towards a black hole, possibly while still trying to make sense of the experience that was the Twilight franchise.
The film is essentially a potpourri of ideas and visuals borrowed from a variety of different existing cult sci fi movies, but the ones which stood out were 2001, Solyaris , Silent Running and even Interstellar , because why not. Although it was pretty obvious there were huge budgetary constraints, the resultant special effects and set design were still sort of decent. At least they didn't completely break the suspension of disbelief.The best scenes were definitely of Robert Pattison trying to take care of his infant daughter. The chemistry felt very natural. Usually in movies involving babies , they put in a fake baby for wider shots and the same sequence of baby sounds for the foley artists to use. Here, I really got the sense that there was a baby on board. Also , I liked how the film depicted the effect of entering a black hole being more realistic as compared to Interstellar.But that's pretty much where the pros stop. The premise, which was nice, was not well fleshed out . There were too many characters and not enough time to give them a proper identity. Add to the fact that despite this, the film is still slow moving with a lot of unnecessary time taken to establish a scene. There also is a weird masturbation scene involving Juliette Binoche but instead of getting my blood boiled up, it made me extremely uncomfortable. But yes, I would still recommend it if you want something outside of popcorn movies at the theater.",High Life

132,safeJ,"Only watched to the ""end"" as curiosity got the better of me.",5,10 September 2020,"I agreed completely with Metaflix's review of 24 April 2019. So many unanswered questions. Was the mission to explore the black hole or to test out ways to strengthen the human genome against the rigors of space (radiation, etc.), or all of the above? Everything came to a head when crazy Boyse killed the pilot and took the shuttle to survey the black hole, or whatever. She seemed to explode when sucked up in the vortex. This leads to more violence aboard the ship when the Doctor is attacked, etc. Ultimately, the doctor walks out of the airlock without a spacesuit, leaving her body intact (goof noted). We note the major effort of Monte putting all the bodies into spacesuits before dumping them into space.How did Boyse's body end up in the cryochamber (apparently otherwise intact)? Did the shuttle return to the ship on autopilot? Did they have a spare shuttle as seen at the end of the film?The last 20 minutes or so of the film was the most peaceful, just Monte and the now teenage Willow. Some reviewers referred to the ""sad ending,"" but I couldn't be sad because I didn't really know what ultimately happened. The both get in the shuttle (suited up appropriately for space) and assume to head for the black hole. The last we see is the couple in their normal cloths, Monte asking Willow if she was ready and she replying in the positive. Then we see the white screen, we hear Pattinson's sad song, and then see the ending titles.In conclusion, this was a film that one would either love or not care about.

Ironically, if you over analyze this you'll pick up on little nitpicks that are beyond the scope of what you should really focus on which is that there is no point. Humans are trash and we're all headed towards an impending doom. Not every movie needs to entertain you (albeit this is for a very niched crowd of art films).

Their families will be compensated. Makes little sense unless the criminals are walled off from a lead crew person who has a normal functioning brain. Especially given the number of years the trip is going to take. Instead you have obtuse interactions that can only lead to chaos. Sure, a government would never fund a project like this. But let's make a movie and hope for the best. Also, it appears there is not much high tech in the future where we have the ability to fly 99 pct. near the speed of light. Ok, that was a budget issue!Our lead crewman Monte played by Robert Pattinson was excellent. He was otherwise believable in this big mess. Dibs, the doctor played by Juliette Binoche, another former killer onboard seems preoccupied finding a perfect fetus under the rigors of space radiation. She does well to show her semi normal to largely weird interactions with the crew. Also, we get an inside look into her predilection for self-pleasure. This theme is carried over to other crew members. Apparently to build tension.Without any real purpose the movie seems untethered with flash backs that provide a nonsensical explanation of the current situation. The ending is unsettled but we can assume that it is not good for Pattinson and his daughter. So, the gift the audience receives for their time spent watching the movie is to be slightly annoyed once the puzzle piece comes together and we only dislike the lead even more, and question the reason for the movie being made.

That being said, just because it's a piece of art doesn't mean, That I find it a successful piece of art.
There is a lot of art out there, but not to many pieces, which I find extraordinary or
uniquely note-worthy.This film, I find cumbersome and heavy. Although it takes place in outer space, that seems to be just a situation to have the cast in an isolated situation, so they can inter-act in that environment. I don't think, that it's actually about space travel, which would probably be disappointing to many viewers. Scientifically it doesn't really make any sense. A gaggle of convicts, with no scientific knowledge are sent into space, supposedly to harvest energy from the periphery of a black hole. How in the world is that supposed to happen ? The film gives us no clue.To me this film was more like ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf"", than ""2001- A Space Odyssey"". A group of psychologically broken individuals yelling and fighting with each other over just about anything. I see many ideas, that can be mined from the film. My take away, is that without a real purpose to their lives, they really feel meaningless in their new-found situation and eventually give up and resort to their former self-destructive selves.

145,TheDoomSong,Indie-clichés cripple this ugly bore of a movie,3,14 July 2021,"High Life features a somewhat interesting premise and is ultimately bogged down by many indie film clichés that unfortunately all work out in the worst possible way.The most aggrivating thing about the film by auteuresse Claire Denis is its sluggish pace, which shows in many different ways: Scenes continue for too long and are dragged out by drowsy, listless performances. Given, the sedation of the space ships inmates is a valid plot point that is addressed and in context makes some sense, but is it really worth it if that means that each scene feels like you are watching it in slow-motion? The pace is further disturbed and hindered by completely needless time-jumps, that add next to nothing to building tension or creating an intriguing narrative and instead make the film move even slower. One of the most painful scenes is happening about two thirds into the movie, when Juliette Binoche's wicked fertility doctor increases the sedative in the crew's water and the acting therefore becoming even more slurred and bored from there on.The sound mix does not help as it decides to make the often mumbled, whispered lines often inaudible, even though there is barely a score to hide them behind. It is a very regrettable choice for what interesting bits High Life has to offer, they are almost entirely delivered in the odd, meaningful, ominous line here and there and very rarely presented visually.Which introduces the next problem: The film is not a looker at all, which is a shame considering what other low-budget movies managed to get out of a sci-fi setting by actually using creativity and craftsmanship to counter the lack of grandiose CGI (e.g. Prospect) . But High Life features one of the least inspired and frankly ugliest set designs in the recent years, with a ship looking like a rusty Lego brick, suits that seem to have been fabricated by sewing rags together and sparse use of tech that looks like it was just ordered off Amazon for a few hundred bucks and thrown in the shot entirely without dressing up. Granted, the rag-tag ambience is a deliberate choice, but how unique and interesting are the gadgets that the inmates in the movie are clobbering together going to look, if everything else looks the same?Apart from shortcomings stemming from the limited budget and the poor artistic choices, what eventually undoes High Life in its entirety is the nonsensical plot, that deals with prisoners being shot into space to somehow retrieve information on alternative energy sources from a black hole. How? We don't really get to know. Why these specific people? We don't get to know that either. And in combination with a ludicrous plot about artificial insemination that is forced upon the inmates by yet another inmate the film just crumbles apart. The power structure within the ship's crew makes no sense and should fall apart from the get-go. For unexplained reasons everybody maintains the cruel and absurd goings-on until the logical meltdown is somehow played as a cathartic happening.The best thing about High Life are the performances by Binoche, whose disturbed and broken doctor persona keeps you interested as you never quite know how tight her power-grip is and how far she can and is willing to push her cruel experiments. Pattinson is solid, if a bit one-dimensional. The breakout performance is clearly delivered by Mia Goth who plays Boyse, a fretful but fierce wild-child who makes fickle alliances with different characters to benefit her goals that - besides her survival - are never fully formed.In the end, High Life is utterly unenjoyable and never manages to lift the interesting premise above what it is - instead showing shortcomings on almost all levels, from narration to direction.",High Life

Yes, it takes place in space, en route and near a black hole, but it is not the setting the matters but the reaction of the characters and the humanity coming from it. The sci-fi part is pretty boring: The crew has to get to a black hole and try a couple of slingshot manuvers which are really risky, but theoretically speed up the vessel more than it has travelled before. (So the gravity of the black hole gives an impulse to the vessel to gain speed without investing energy). They try it twice and you won't know the result. And all that was the sci-fi.The human part is more interesting though. The crew consists of death row convicts, they escaped their execution or life long imprisionment by travelling by the ship. To keep them in check they recieve a lot of sedatives and are allowed to masturbate regurally in some sort of sex cabin. One of the convicts, a woman who murdered her children and husband acts as the doctor and wants to get the women on board pregnant. So she gradually harvests the semen of the men and tries to impregnate the women. She basically wants to create a baby, after she killed her family. All the characters act like humans and can't supress their insticts even with medicine after some time: the instinct to have sex and to get revenge, settle things with violence etc.While it works on a philosphic level, it is really slow and doesn't get anywhere or too far from the sci-fi or story perspective.

In this case, it is a black hole, which metaphorically represents the film. So be aware, you are not going to understand the purpose of the voyage, and nothing about the characters makes much sense either.On the positive side, there is some interesting use of scientific experimentation and some interesting set design as well as a couple of attractive cast members. However, no one other than Robert Pattison gets to say much. Juliette Binoche is wasted in a role in which she has to play a very annoying Nurse Ratchit-type of bitchy scientist, and is very unlikable, which is unfortunate, considering she is usually the best thing about a film. Here, her talent is wasted on a very obnoxious role.I gather from the little bit I gleaned from all her 12 or 13 lines that Juliette plays a Scientist who is conducting an experiment in getting one of the young women pregnant, but in order to do so, she has to use the turkey baster method. When one of the young studs tried to impregnate a girl naturally, the subsequent furor among the cast made absolutely no sense whatsoever. If the goal is to reproduce, why aren't they reproducing? Are the women all lesbians? Not clear.This is a baffling and confusing 2 hours, made by a master filmmaker, who tries very hard to make some kind of a statement, but in all honesty, I could not think of what that statement might be.",High Life

154,JamiroBontes,The Space-Drama of your nightmares!,4,19 March 2019,"When High Life started I saw a beautifully lit and shot movie, and when I saw Robert Pattison outside reaparing the ship while talking to his kid, I thought I was in for a fantastic slow building space drama. Eventually what I got was a uninteresting snore fest.Let's start with saying I think the film looks gorgeous, the film is lit by an expert you can just tell. I also thought Robert Pattison who I loved in Good Time was alright in the movie. So before I give my negatives I want to say that I really couldn't give this movie lower then a 4 because I was defenitlly in awe of how it was lit. But now my negatives, I think the movie really doesn't have a pacing what so ever. There are scenes were nothing happens, and this goes on and on and were somthing like 2001 A space Odessey has that to sometimes the plot in that movie is always moving forward in every scene, it may take long but there is always something happening that moves the plot along. This movie doesn't have that. I also think the acting is absolutelly terrible from everybody else. Dr. Dibs is terrible and the teenage Willow is just afwul. The story of the film I can imagine is hard to follow but luckilly I got it and even the story is really bad so I think the concept is good 'isolated in space with your kid' but it was a terrible story and it really needed someting else, something interresting.I really cannot recommend this movie because it's really boring and I am not saying that the pacing is to slow for me, I am saying there isn't any pacing at all! I was looking forward to this movie but I am extremelly let down. Do not watch it unless you like convoluted, pretentious nonsense!",High Life

160,moritzmeyerautor,"A high risk, high reward watch - If you allow this movie to get to you, you might learn something about yourself",8,16 October 2019,"Some films elude categories such as ""good"" or ""bad"". They don't exist to be watched for pure entertainment. They are exhausting and demand a lot from you while you watch them. But high risk, high reward, as they say: If you get through a watch like High Life, you'll end up taking so much more than just a few cheap thrills.
I had to let this film sink after I had watched it. I had seen images of swollen dog corpses and dripping sperm cups, pumping machines and scarred bellies, black holes and red stains of menstrual blood. Robert Pattinson is the main character, a murderer whose punishment is to travel to the outer limits of the universe in a human laboratory without hope of return. But the death flight becomes a mission of hope as new life emerges aboard the interstellar prison. Suddenly Pattinson's character has a daughter, and gets the chance to make up for the mistakes of the past.
Of course, High Life is arthouse cinema. This isn't a space saga that will sweep you away, and you just have to ride the wave, the rest will happen by itself, and in the end you'll relish at bombastic special effects and epic storytelling. For this movie you have to open up. You have to allow it to set streams of thoughts in motion and start head cinema. You have to be ready to be disturbed, maybe even shocked, to notice at some point: This isn't a convoluted, inapproachable art installation. It's also not a space shocker in which the monster from outer space takes care of things at some point. Instead, the monster lures within ourselves as humans.
Claire Denis has created a rather simple story about things we deal with everyday: it's about violence and sexuality, masculinity and femininity, about responsibility and trust, about growing up and growing old, about being a father and (not) becoming a mother. You can decide for yourself what this film will do to you. But you will certainly want to think about this film, to understand it when you have seen it. There isn't a higher praise for outstanding cinema.",High Life

163,mike_diamond,Space as an existential prison,7,13 June 2020,"Claire Denis returns with High Life, an exploration into the animalistic and mystical properties of existence. Robert Pattinson stars as Monte, a death row inmate who has deferred his execution in favour of a research mission to space. He is accompanied on his expedition by a cadre of criminals under the control of a mad scientist, played by Juliette Binoche. We meet Monte alone, caring for his infant daughter Willow. They're floating through space in a rundown pod, more dilapidated trailer than Apollo shuttle. We get the sense that something bad has happened, and as Denis propels us through the non-linear timeline, the lives that once encapsulated the pod are extinguished. We experience the prison-like atmosphere and the instinctual motives of its inhabitants. The interactions are kept sparse and focus on the more base aspects of life: blood, semen, and sweat. Although plotted as space survival, Denis' mastery comes from capturing the simplicity of mankind's perpetuation while probing the philosophical musings of survival. If these abstractions aren't alluring enough, does a nude Juliette Binoche riding a Sybian appeal to you?",High Life
164,jason-16503,Slow burn...well actually more like a slow ooze from a festering carbuncle,2,29 September 2020,"Some amazing acting by both Robert Pattinson and Juliette Binoche in some very difficult roles and although film had some elements of Silent Running and other great films about post apocalyptic space exploration, High Life falls way off the mark to the point of incoherence. The only black hole explored in this film belongs to Juliette Binoche, and therein lies the rub, a film about sexual deviancy and moral depravity masquerading as a science fiction film. I always love it when the 10 star reviewers try to insult the low star reviewers because we don't get the art or the deeper meaning of the film. True, we don't write our reviews while sipping malt whiskey from crystal tumblers whilst lounging in our drawing room arm chairs wearing an ascot and dressing gown, but pretty easy to see what's going on in this film. I suspect the only high ratings come from those enlightened pseudo-intellectuals or those who identify with the writer/director's sexual hangups. This is perhaps why the film gets such high ratings from the experts. They love the Binoche self gratification scene. There are some interesting themes throughout the movie about parenthood, guilt and misplaced efforts to right the wrongs of our past and consequences of the choices we make but all is spoiled by the depravity that was otherwise unnecessary to the plot. Then again, without it, the film would have had very little plot and been much shorter. The director almost goes full Lars von Trier on us but fails miserably. In the end, Monte asks Willow if she's ready and she says yes but for what, we don't know. We can only assume more depravity. Music by Stuart Staples was a nice choice for this film though.",High Life
165,bikerpaul68,Easy to understand,9,23 November 2020,"This film made a huge impression on me and I'd like to try and reply to everyone who gave it only 1 or 2 stars. But it's not easy without giving away important elements of the plot, and I think it's far better to watch the film with an open mind, not knowing anything about it in advance. So in the end this review might be more helpful to people who haven't seen the film yet.
In the two interviews which appear as extras on the Blu-Ray disc, the director, Claire Denis, makes a couple of important remarks. She says, in effect, ""I never thought 'High Life' was going to be a science-fiction story, it's more like a prison film. It's not in the future, it's about us human beings, but it's in space."" And, when asked how she would reply to people who find the film hard to understand, she says, ""It's easy to understand if you don't try too hard."" I also found it interesting to discover that she wrote the original script entirely in French and then had it translated. It's referred to as her first English-language film, but that is only partly true.
So this film will not appeal to anyone expecting another Star Wars or Star Trek. It is bleak, disturbing and sometimes horrifying. It needs to be watched with some attention and concentration to follow what is happening (it does not help that the dialogue is often almost inaudible). It reminded me of Tarkovsky's 'Solaris' in its claustrophobia and interpersonal tensions, and of the film of Ishiguro's 'Never Let Me Go' for the moral and ethical questions it raises. It also has the brutality and bleakness of many of Haneke's films. I may be over-interpreting, but Haneke has confirmed that the flooded forest seen near the beginning of 'Time of the Wolf' is a reference to the flooded forest in Tarkovsky's 'Ivan's Childhood', and one of the very few scenes in 'High Life' set on Earth shows Monte and his dog in a flooded forest.
In her second interview, Denis is clearly irritated by questions about what might have happened after the end of this film. I can only say that I found the last 10 minutes or so quite devastating. So, if all this hasn't put you off, please watch 'High Life'.",High Life

170,Ethan_Ford,It begins superbly but falls into a black hole of mediocrity,5,12 May 2019,"It looks fabulous.Production values seem very high and this must be the most expensive film Claire Denis has ever directed.The basic plot,however,concerning a spaceship consisting mostly of dangerous prisoners coerced into a suicidal mission to try to harvest the energy of a black hole,is at once preposterous and rather derivative of a bad sci-fi film.
But this is the problem with the film.It references too many great sci-films without ever being as successful or original. The opening scenes featuring a hydroponic garden bring to mind ""Silent Running,"" whilst the sex-deprived prisoners take refuge in a machine suspiciously like the orgasmatron from ""Barbarella"". The main point of reference ,however,seems to be ""Solaris"" with many swooning shots along deserted corridors where potential dangers lurk and the feeling of being constantly suspended between reality and hallucination.
While Juliette Binoche,in a part perhaps intended for Isabelle Huppert,is good as the research scientist,the revelation of the film is the performance of Robert Pattinson who is mesmerising in the difficult part of one of the prisoners who has a young child and who carries the film before the other prisoners are introduced in flashback. If the film had been more like ""Silent Running"" or ""Moon"" and had concentrated solely on his plight it might have succeeded.As it is it becomes increasingly incoherent and pretentious.",High Life

It's a low-budget 'gritty' version of SF but as such it doesn't feel honest. How low budget are you when sporting stars like Binoche and Pattison? The fake feel of the sets must be an esthetic choice but to no apparent reason. Even an old and decidedly silly film like ""Dark Star"" handles the theme of dangerous ennui and boredom in a lowfi space setting much better.
Also, the use of sexual abuse to create some scenarios just feels like lazy writing. I get what they were after, a poetic reflection of the human condition set against the backdrop of the merciless empty universe, but there are too many things that doesn't work. With better photo or a more atmospheric soundtrack I could have bought it as an art house flick but it never goes the whole distance. Quite ironic from a movie about an never ending trip through space.

This movie is a dark take on life and human existence in general. No one cares for the main characters, nor do anyone care for the stray dogs' ship which someone here has complained about as if it was a ""plothole"".
First of all, aesthetics. This movie nails it from first to last frame. Secondly, acting: excuse me but what you call ""lack of emotions"" and ""bland"" is actually very precise and subtle. Those are abandoned and unwanted people for crying out loud.
As to the crew's mission I think it's pretty obvious that it was merely an excuse for kinda ""humane"" way of getting rid of extras on overpopulated Earth.

We really did have to laugh out loud. The trailer shows a man on a spaceship with a cute baby. Talk about FALSE ADVERTISING!The premise of the movie is that a hugely costly, technically advanced and experimental space craft, capable of traveling at 99% the speed of light (LOL!) is manned by a crew of death row inmates and a crazy female doctor. The inmates are not told of the fact that they can never return to earth or that their man form of onboard recreation will be sperm donation and masturbation. This story has NOTHING to do with science fiction. It is just a sordid, boring, and uninteresting voyeuristic fever dream by a group of people with no talent and nothing to say.

190,geekhead,Sci-fi that never met gravity or space (VERY MINOR spoilers from first 15m of film),1,14 July 2019,"In the first 3 minutes I knew this film was going to be bad. Like REALLY bad. First hint... ""Monte"" is in a space suit that looks like it's made of cardboard material, on his HANDS AND KNEES on the OUTSIDE of a craft, working on it with a wrench. The writers apparently did not know one FLOATS in space and cannot REST on hands and knees on the outside of a craft! He also moves as if on earth, rather than with the slow movements of someone in a weightless environment. I even wondered why he had on the suit since he was obviously not in space... then realized my god... we're supposed to think he is!But it gets worse... he nimbly tightens a bolt by spinning it freely with his hand (that is, he gives it a fast whirl and it spins down on its own), which would also require gravity. But no, that's not all... he DROPS the wrench (yes, it DROPS from his hand to the craft, rather than floating off) then slides DOWN the craft's side and falls off. Yeah. Just like on earth. Because they didn't bother to make it look like he was in actual space!But there's more... the backdrop of space behind him is, well... there's no space at all. That's right. Space minus space or stars. Or ANYTHING. It's not even ""deep black"" but ""flat' black with no depth. You could tell he was simply in a dark room.Have they never heard of CGI??And there's more. I trudged on a whole 15 or 16 minutes...The inside of this 'craft' is complete with linoleum flooring and drop ceilings, walls and door jams. It looks like an old office building from the 50s, and that's probably what it was.Then it got worse...At a point he decides to toss some bodies out the door. Yes. It was a sliding door, not a hatch. And even though the ""door"" to 'space' was open, making the compartment he was in weightless, he was walking around in there with his space suit on (and no tether), and the bodies were sitting against the walls as heavy as if on earth, with him struggling to pick up each one and 'drop' it out the door ""into space."" And yes, each one DROPPED OUT THE DOOR just like on earth (you could just imagine them landing on a mattress a couple feet below). Instead of floating off... like they ALL should have been floating as soon as that door opened, and all he should have had to do was give them a slight nudge and they would have floated out. And again... NO STARS out that door. And no sense of depth.Like a moveable wall was a few feet away, painted black.Did they never see ""Gravity"" ... or go to high school?I had to turn it off at that point. I'm not a science snob but at least get the basics right. You can't call a movie sci-fi and COMPLETELY ignore the most basic principles of science! We can suspend disbelief that there are craft that can travel interstellar... we can't suspend disbelief about how gravity works, what space and weightlessness are like... or that there are STARS in space!.If you want a good space movie go see Gravity again.

191,Cosmicosa,This is NOT a review; It's an opinion,7,29 June 2020,"Genuinely a film for those who love cinema; as opposed to those who love Hollywood and it's equivalents.Not a perfect film but I watched it twice within 24 hours, then decided to rate it well and write a review (opinion) about it. (Disclaimer, no MCU title has ever come close to evoking that outcome). So I guess High Life is my kind of thing.There is so much going on in the filmmakers mind that fitting it into a concise wholly coherent narrative proved a challenge; that said, I appreciated the ambition.What is it about? Accepting Death, mostly. Embracing Death, partly.Left me with a feeling akin to Ingmar Bergman's The Seventh Seal. Although, the screenplay for The Seventh Seal was in my opinion better rounded even with the equally challenging narrative structure of that film.I will say no more other than a quick note about Juliette Binoche and Robert Paterson together; sometimes a thing just works effortlessly. Glad they both decided to do this one.Watch it, but not for the premise promoted in the trailer because you will be disappointed as that whole 'convict recycled for science' thing serves only as a pretext. It's mostly about choosing to face one's own mortality head on.Watch it if you don't mind playing with that little topic.",High Life

Nope, it's a stinking pile of lingering damages from taking too much LSD in the 60's.A dildo-room, where the apparently barren doctor gets off, transform into a gian sheep(?), and the ""cum"" simply spills onto a puddle on the outside of the room, for some reason.The first 20 minutes sets the tone, with the jarring cries from a baby every 2 minutes. I am sure they put a microphone into the mouth of this crier, to keep the volume of this bawling 300% more powerful than the ambient sounds and dialog (the few times someone mumbles something).You know what? This director should keep her talentless activities to the theater, so that people with issues and ""special interests"" can enjoy it, while the rest of us can get some actual entertainment.The fake-reviewers and the high-brow ""art"" reviewers online, praising this, should be ignored.In reality, the ship would have seen mutiny withing 1 week,
Many of the men would have been killed and the women turned into sex-slaves.
Then again, this would not happen, the ship would stop working after a week.Stay away.",High Life

All it did was just be a movie about what it would be like for criminals to get sent out into space for the rest of their lives and how they would cope with being out there. That's not to say it wasn't brutal. It was very brutal. I couldn't believe half the stuff I was seeing, and after watching this movie I wouldn't wish for a future where something like this happens. There were some positive moments: getting to see Robert Pattinson play a dad was the highlight of this movie. That and the cinematography. I liked the closeness and simplicity of it.

Denis is uncompromising in creating a film that is a difficult but beautiful watch. In the end, it becomes a really emotional watch despite the messed up content as you near the end.What drives this movie, and saves it at times, is Pattinson's quietly intense performance. Pattinson barely has lines, which makes it much more impressive that he can drive the film. He has an intensity yet comfort to him that is majestically illustrated when he interacts with his baby.But the ending is awful. Denis leaves it too ambiguous and makes me question her ability to finish the film. I would have liked a conclusion that resolves the narrative in a clear manner. Perhaps the ambiguity stays true to the entire narrative, but it just undermines the momentum the film makes in the last 30 minutes.Overall, a good film and cool watch.",High Life

206,newsbizliz,"Robert Pattinson is stellar; the film is overall, very good with some shortcomings",9,15 June 2019,"First, while I understand many of the criticisms in other reviews, I have to say, I got this film. I understood what Claire Denis was attempting to get across. I think, if some of the critics had better understood many of the underlying points she was trying to convey, some of the criticism wouldn't have been nearly as sharp.I won't go into an entire breakdown of the film, that's already been done, and quite well, by others. But, in short, this is a film about humankind's own destruction of itself, on multiple levels. In a flashback narrative, High Life explores interaction between criminals, considered 'outcasts; throwaways', on an extended, ill-fated mission to see whether energy could be extracted from an area close to a black hole.In my opinion, Denis masterfully depicts the darkness of loneliness, depression, desperation, violence and human desire, as well as to what extent humans will go to when they're facing the edge of extinction.The film's underlying obsession with sexuality, body fluids and reproduction is more understandable if you get the fact Dr. Dibs (played very credibly by Juliet Binoche) is, in a twisted way, trying to atone for murdering her own husband and children, by attempting biological experimentation to instigate artificial procreation under impossible circumstances.This film may not be Denis's best effort (some scenes do feel rather random and some ideas somewhat incomplete, I will admit) , but I applaud her loudly for staying true to herself.By and large, High Life is an original, fascinating film that's worth watching, with solid performances by Binoche and Mia Goth and anther truly outstanding performance by Robert Pattinson in the role of Monte (it was the highlight of the film, watching Monte -- a criminal with a conscience you might say -- grow into the role of a loving father with a needy infant, despite his own desperation).If you're an individual who tends to see things only in black and white, this is probably not a film for you. However, if you are someone who can think in the abstract ... who can see beyond what is simply apparent, I recommend you give High Life a try.On its own merits, I might have rated this movie 7 stars, but the superb acting and the ridiculously close-minded views of some of the reviews leads me to elevate my rating to 9 stars.",High Life

210,d0ugdimmadome,"Like the film's characters, the plot seems to aimlessly drift onwards through space, with no clear goal",4,19 September 2019,"I came into this movie expecting to enjoy it; Robert Pattinson has re-emerged from his twilight days as an interesting, dynamic actor - and it's set in space! I thought I'd find plenty to enjoy in the macabre story of criminals being sent into deep space, but, much like the film's characters, the plot seems to aimlessly and hopelessly drift through space, on and on and on.Given the film's innovative storyline - a group of criminals are sent on a suicide mission into deep space - and the undeniable talent of lead man Robert Pattinson, all the pieces were in place to create an intriguing character study, exploring the mental strains such a hopeless fate could have on people. However, the characters are, for the most part, pretty bland, with each one given too little to do to be able communicate any kind of personality. Pattinson spends the movie staring at things whilst looking sad and by the end of the movie you don't feel like you've gotten to know his ""Monte"" in the slightest. The villainous doctor Dibs played by Juliette Binoche is pretty boring as well, barely giving you any motivation to dislike her or even support her. Mia Goth's Boyse is the most interesting character due to her eccentric, angry and erratic personality traits, but even she falls too short, with Denis giving the audience no chance to understand her or get to know her, instead creating a cliched and forgettable character. The character development in this movie is practically nonexistent. We meet them, we watch them mope about their spacecraft with not much to do and when they die we feel nothing.The film is quiet and reflective, yet we're given no substantial material to reflect on. The film's highlight comes in the form of an intense scene depicting an attempted rape, which proves to be disturbing and harrowing to watch. If the rest of the film could have replicated the pace, intensity and sense of dread from this violent moment then this could have been a remarkable piece of cinema, examining the effects such a deep space death sentence could have on the criminals who endure it. But, the rest of the film slowly plods on, seemingly devoid of any real stakes or direction.Despite this film harbouring the potential to have been something great, it wastes that potential due to it's painfully slow pace, aimless plot and dull characters, who are given nothing to do throughout the film.",High Life

216,baeckw,"""Solaris"" has found a worthy successor",9,25 November 2020,"I came round here checking out the reviews, before watching, and I was a bit intimidated by the online misgivings and the low score. Still, I'm the kind of viewer who enjoyed the US remake of 'Solaris' immensely, and I figured that this movie went in that direction, so I watched anyway - and I'm glad I did.
Yes, it is pretentious. Yes, it is artistic. But film making used to be a form of art, and I don't mind when a determined director forces their personal taste upon us, when delivering their work of art. Yes, this movie is so focused on style, that it skips over the plot hastily, to make room for another slow-paced brooding scene. But it worked for me. Much of the same criticism could be uttered about 'Solaris', which somehow seems to be held in higher regard.
This doesn't mean that any space opera can automatically lure me in as if it were '2001'. I didn't care much for 'Ad Astra' with Brad Pitt, for example. If the big name couldn't rescue 'Ad Astra', then 'High Life' definitely benefited from its A-list actors. Robert Pattinson's great performance lifts the entire movie.

We then cut to where they have 'fallen' and six of them take up the frame, floating upright like whales asleep in the depths of the sea.The intrigue of black holes and subtle psychoanalysis being on a death-row mission in space suddenly gets put on the back-burner as promiscuity slithers into forefront. I understand French cinema is less concerned about sex than the U.S., but this seemed superfluous and unsophisticated.The atmosphere was haunting enough but no cool questions about time dilation or the deterioration of the body which takes place when traveling near the speed of light arise. A fantastic twist could have left us disturbed and perplexed, but the majority of the time we are wondering when the plot will get back on track.Only once do we get an accurate depiction of what should happen when someone travels next to a black hole. It's very graphic and rewarding but it doesn't justify the movie's unimpactful themes.",High Life
219,dfjwebdesign,Stop saying it's boring...,8,4 January 2021,"Other reviewers keep saying this movie is ""a bore"". They're probably the same kind of people who'd call Sunshine a ""bore"". And in some ways they'd be right. If you're the average moviegoer who's idea of a good sci-fi movie is Guardians of the Galaxy, that's fine, but you're not going to enjoy something like this. If you enjoy 2001: A Space Odyssey, you're getting closer, but you may still not like this. This is more fiction than science, and it's got a dash of European surrealism.Is this the greatest movie ever? No, but I felt compelled to defend it from the haters. ""It's got no point"" sure, if you need a paint by numbers story arc with a clear beginning, middle and end, this is going to be a bummer. But did Napoleon Dynamite have a point? No. It's a character piece. There's different types of narratives. It's obnoxious when someone hates a movie because they can't play on their phone while watching and still ""get it"".This is an indie film through and through. The spacesuits don't even look like they'd keep you warm on a cold day in Boston, let alone the deeps of space. But effort was made, they still look good enough to suspend disbelief. We as a viewer accept that in this world they do what they're supposed to.It's about Robert Pattinson's character (Monte) who's alone on a spaceship, attempting to keep himself and his infant daughter alive. He's great in this, though the acting of the entire cast is subdued and off-putting. Then through flashbacks and some minor narration we learn that the ship was inhabited by convicts (Monte among them) and one by one they all basically succumb to madness. The movie does well with the ""show, don't tell"" concept, for the most part. Something that mainstream flicks do not.The doctor on the ship is a woman more obsessed with facilitating a child birth on the ship, than the well-being of the inmates. Due to this movie's psychological angle, and the inevitable mental decline of its players, this leads to extraction and manipulation of seminal fluid. Some might find this ""gratuitous"" or for ""gross out"" factor... it's neither. People will defend WAP all day long, but show semen on film for 5 seconds and the movie is ""trash"".The fact of the matter is, this movie is a well-done, probably low budget (relative to Hollywood. Put it this way, they just spent an ADDITIONAL 100M to reshoot/recut the Justice League). It's a standalone story, no sequels, no spin offs. And it's job isn't to make you smile. It's to entertain and keep you going ""wtf"".This is a movie that requires your full attention, and it is engaging. Pattinson is a sympathetic character, and so are some of the others, even when someone murders someone else, you get why, and you half root for them. It's unique, and weird, and dark and quiet, and bold.It's not gonna change your life, but it's hardly a waste of time as many of these other reviewers insist.",High Life

Movie 2 is a lot of really disturbing sex stuff involving unpleasant people. Because movie 1 is pretty good and some of the visuals were decent, I'll give it a 4.One thing that bothered me in the movie, if mankind had the ability to harness the power of a black hole, potentially giving us almost unlimited power, wouldn't they send a more reliable crew on an 18 year mission than convicted murderers? I get they aren't coming home, but not the most stable or technically adept crew to send. And even if you can get past that, why would they think making them do weird sex experiments the whole way would be a good idea?

But High Life is none of those things. It is two hours of ponderous silence and random, unexplained behavior. Two hours of incomprehensible whisper-mumbling. So little of an already-thin story is ever explained. It's a deliberately opaque style masquerading as complexity.There's also a difference between good non-linear storytelling and disjointed, incompetent storytelling. A good non-linear structure adds additional layers of meaning, engaging the viewer to ponder how it all fits together, how the past informs the future and how the future reflects/echoes the past. With a poorly done version, the viewer spends much of his/her time thinking ""WTF am I looking at?? WTF is happening?? Where am I? When am I?""The 10-star reviews argue this film explores meaningful subjects like mortality, redemption, despair, and solitude. No it doesn't. It unsuccessfully *attempts* to discuss such subjects. And I say ""discuss"" generously. The film simply tosses in thematic bits of dialogue & behavior with little context or motivation. The characters don't feel like actual people, but rather mouthpieces for whatever the filmmaker wishes to ""discuss"" at the moment.

Likely it's not your cup of tea and the fact you claim you watch a lot of movies means nothing - most of movies are meant to be fast food.
So why I liked it? There is nothing outstanding - legit operator's work with long shots and slow camera, familiar story of time, space, love and solitude, slow pace. But it is the right balance that kept me on a hook for entire 90 minutes.

239,JFSebastianpc,Alien,7,6 January 2020,"This is a unique film. It's a space expedition and like real expeditions contains dangers and misfortunes. For me the story didn't work. I think the director wasn't brave enough to make it clear that there is no story. There is just a fragmented reality of awe, loneliness, lust and stillness. A man and a baby in a spaceship, a perished crew, some experiments in the background, that's it. If the story was simpler it would be better. The filming on the other hand is very effective. It manages something special, to create an existential experience. This is what a sci fi film is supposed to feel like, alien.

Prepare for a crazy ride into deep outer space with a motley crew of death-row/lifer convicts as they endure personal struggles with autonomy, fortitude, redemption, morality, primal needs and humanity in the face of growing despair hopelessness and solitude. This is not a film for the easily triggered, nor for those who can't abide elliptical storytelling-you will not be spoon-fed.

The lead (Pattinson's Monte) is an unlikeable character that lacks credibility as an actual person that could exist anywhere. His redeeming trait is that he doesn't want anything from anyone. He mostly mutters to the audience and punches other characters in the face when he's not caring for a baby.The lead antagonist is an even more convoluted character. She's a criminal? scientist? Sex freak? In charge of the mission? She collects sperm and is for some never explained reason trying to make a radiation proof baby. I think they tried to make her sexy, but it just comes off as disgusting.If you're looking for a super slow flick with a wailing baby and a muddled story line with no payoff at the end, then you should give the High Life a watch.

268,costasgeorgatos,Good effort but issed the target,5,2 May 2019,"*SPOILERS AHEAD *
Soooo boring! Well, I anticipated it somewhat by the same nature of where the... action is been set: A deep space vecel with a destination of no return, a black hole. The target is to harness the immense power of the black hole for the benefit of mankind. Also, obviously there is another goal, to reproduce people in the radioactive environment of the spaceship.
But years go by and no kid grows up there. Partly because women passenger doesn't want to. This is the first question mark: Why?
As time goes by passengers go violent and/or crazy, and die or get murdered one by one.
Typical. And there is no explanation of what they think, or how they feel, because almost no one actually speaks, except for the weird witch fertility doctor and Patisson. Eventually, a healthy is born by the sperm by our hero. Then the doctroress suicides and the remaining
passengers die or get murdered. Without much explanation.
Thereafter, Patisson grows the baby girl on his own. The girl grows up and has become a beautiful lady when they reach their destination, the black hole. And what they do? They ride a small spaceship and dive into the black hole! Or they maybe orbit the event horizon.
How knows!? And no f...ng experiment on the black hole takes place, neither is any indication of there was such orders to the passengers, or some automatic procedure to be performed by the spaceship itself. WTF!??
Movie concludes with a bizarre (and of course, completely unexplained and incomprehensible) end scene of the father and his daughter.
Oh well, a very moody song by Tindersticks follows. That's all that I got from a 100 minute boredom.

Midway through I realized I did not like this movie. It was too dark for what I wanted to watch. I think it was a great and fresh concept. Maybe it was like The 100-prisoners set out into space as an experiment and then things go wrong. Here is why I can't put much support. The content. We have seen rape by male perpetrators throughout history. And so here is a twist. Let's see a woman being the rapest and let's see where that goes. This felt like experimental theater. And maybe it's a great vehicle for a college course in philosophy or feminism or film in general. But for me, I felt like, as a viewer, I was just abused to make some point. It seems pretentious at best. And I feel like I wasted my time. It didn't add to my life; it didn't add to my perspective; it wasn't an escape from life, and I left feeling dark, violated,

I've been to film festivals, I've seen a lot of great movies but also a lot of awful ones. This is one of the worst I've seen.
I'm struggling to find anything positive. The actors tried to make the best of it but are fighting a hopeless script in an awful set.It's supposed to be science fiction. You can debate the fiction but there's definitely not a shred of science in sight. The lousy excuse of constant acceleration to explain the gravity on the ship, only to announce that the ship has started to slow down without any loss of that artificial gravity. The space suits have helmets that are open at the back. After Monte has been to the ship with the dogs he claims he needs to decontaminate. Next we don't see him cleaning his suit but taking a shower in his vegetable plot.
The ship runs on some magic energy source. Nevermind the energy needed for life support, apparently the engines need to constantly accelerate the box of a ship.Dibs is a scientist and prison warden. The prisoners are also crew members that have to work together. For some reason during the 'day' they can walk around freely and work with tools and potential weapons, but during the 'night' they need to be locked up. Some are tied to their bed with cable ties for some unexplained reason while others are not.
Somehow after 20 years in space the ship meets up with a similar ship that turns out to be full of dogs. No explanation of how the dogs survived by themselves for all that time, or why that ship apparently doesn't need the daily reports to keep the systems alive.I have no problem with nudity but the long scene where Dibs masturbates on a big metal dildo is awful and serves no purpose other than showing Juliette Binoche naked.The most disturbing part of the film are the rape scenes. First a male prisoner/ crew member with tattoos rapes a female prisoner/ crew member and is punished severely. Next the female 'scientist' puts drugs in the ships drinking water (that apparently she doesn't drink herself) and while everyone is unconscious she rapes a male crew member. Apparently that's all fine because she loves him and it's in the name of science. She then goes to the female quarters and rapes one of the women to insert the sperm she just collected.Suddenly we jump 15 years ahead. The baby is now a teenage girl. Just to show she's now a grown woman (and I guess as part of the reproduction theme) we have to see the blood stains on the sheets from having her period. Then father and daughter 'have a good feeling' about the next black hole they've found, get in their escape pod, and....
finally the movie is over. Two hours I'll never get back.",High Life
306,linusliebetrau,It is rather... special,7,7 June 2019,"First of all, don't watch this movie if you don't like to be left puzzled afterwards. This movie is not at all what you might expect from the description.To be honest, I planned to leave a low score. When I saw the movie, I firstly was utterly disappointed. Starting with a specific scene including the foto booth (you will know what I mean after watching the movie) I was rather confused. Though the movie seemed to make more and more sense over time, it really is not what you expect from the description. In the end I was unpleased with the movie and its ending.However, after reading one of the low score reviews, I completely changed my mind. I cannot consider it a bad movie anymore, though I am still disappointed that the movie did not meet the description. (Actually the description is misleading) However, this movie is a puzzle without instructions. An Analogy completely unrelated to actual space travel. The movie kept me thinking about it more than with any other movie I watched recently. I also cannot say that I fully understood it by now. (I think this isn't the point after all) But getting you to think and reconsider your view is actually quite a remarkable aspect and accounts for the artistic nature of this movie.You should not understand the movie as a ""sci-fi"" but rather as an analogy. After all, I think it has more in common with David Bowies song ""Space Oddity"" than with and actual science fiction movie. And this is actually all I can say without spoiling too much. Prepare to get puzzled.Plus the title song by the tindersticks is quite likeable.",High Life

Even for a pretentious theatrical representation one would expect better acting.Everything revolves around sex: disgusting and graphic, called upon to mask the feebleness of plot. The creators also seemed to have a gross fetish with semen - it's everywhere.Not a sci-fi to boot. Defies all laws of physics. But you must see it to experience the laughable space suits and the head pieces made of thick cotton akin to those used in bee husbandry. Half expected to see all heads implode during space walking but didn't happen. The flying toaster of a spaceship is preposterous.Cheap, pretentious flick with little substance.",High Life
313,vivekv-26145,Not an art film,1,24 January 2021,"I went blind into this movie. Hoping to watch a sci-fi atmospheric slow-burn horror flick with the promising lead of Robert Pattinson, who was brilliant in ""The lighthouse"". But to my own demise it was such a huge disappointment.The movie try to set the dramatic stage, contemplating the concept of lonliness in endless space and the sense of impending doom (i.e. death) in the form of black hole they're drifting towards. But it ends up having absolutely no science and no meaningful drama, much like ad astra but even worse.All the characters are written so shallow that you can replace them with cardboard cutouts without having any effects on the story whatsoever. You get a few glimpses of Robert Pattinson's character past life on earth that somewhat suggests that he acts on impulse and resort to violence at the slightest thing that upsets him, but that trait is nowhere to be found in the older version of him. The same could be said for other characters as well.All the positive reviews here try to mark this as an arthouse cinema masterpiece or something close to that. They all try to justify the lack of script (of any kind) and the lack of logic (and science completely) as alluding to the ""Kafkaesque"" meaninglessness of life and that it's a poetry which portrays quality. But No, it's not. The Kafkaesque philosophy translates to the lack of purpose in life or rather the overall meaninglessness of every purpose as the final destination of every being is death, also the inability of a person to make sense of what's happening to him/her at the time and what it's worth.This movie sadly has no relation to any of that. It's just that there is no story that could lead us to that moment where the character under scrutiny just falls apart due to isolation and meaninglessness of his life. It's just an amalgamation of loosely connected segments of dialogue.The only good thing going for the movie is it's sound score and visual effects. Where the visual effects also betrays the basic law of proportion. The ship's size varies as per stories convenience. So if you love arthouse cinema, slow burn horror & sci-fi, there is none of that in this movie.",High Life

315,gdgardiner,Well...,6,27 April 2019,"I'll watch pretty much any movie that takes place in outer space, and I usually like thought provoking movies that are a bit different from what I've seen before. This movie kept me interested, for the most part, but it does move slowly, even though the ship is traveling near the speed of light. The actors were really good, I didn't notice them acting anyway, and I liked the time jumps, so that I had to keep piecing things together. I liked the story overall, but something was missing for me. I'm not sure what? Maybe I didn't quite get it? There were a lot of intense, brooding, mysterious scenes... maybe too many? I thought of it as a kind of metaphor for mankind's journey, and the struggle for life and hope, even though we're probably all hurtling towards our doom. I guess it's the kind of movie you could attach your own meaning to, but for all it's heavy themes, it didn't really hit me so hard emotionally.

The scene with dogs probably symbolizes how nowadays people rather get dogs while it's the children, and not while domesticated still partially wild beasts, who can ease their existential crisis. And at the end when all the energy of space will be gone and universe ceases to exist , we the humans, gonna die anyways.I don't know the film maker but it seems to be a person that has close to nihilism or absurdism.

All the bad reviews almost deterred me from watching it and I'm SO GLAD I gave it a fair chance. The low star reviews actually make me mad now, none of them were honest. Yes it's slow and kinda quiet in the VERY VERY beginning, but it picks up rather quickly, and it keeps up the intensity. As it goes on it truly just continues to get better and better. I dont understand why people are acting like it was a silent film or something, there was an appropriate and satisfactory amount of dialogue throughout. I will say I feel like this is a movie best watched for the first time on your own for it deserves your undivided attention. It's not a typical blockbuster movie, its a masterpiece. It's also not as grotesque and creepy as people made it out to be, it definitely has its uncomfortable and intense scenes ( tw; r/sa, bodily fluids) but they're nothing like others will make it out to be. I've also heard people say the characters have no redeeming qualities, and in the beginning I could kinda understand that, tho I strongly disagree after having finished it. I have to feel like all the bad reviews are from people who stopped watching 15 minutes in. It picks up and just keeps going. People also said the timeline, past to present was confusing, to that I say, just watch his grey hair growth. I was expecting something boring, eerie, and unpleasant...but truth be told the ending was quite lovely and gave me an interesting sense of hope and satisfaction.

I think there is a point here to say about prisoners being the ones going out into space, like there is no point. We learn, though, that these prisoners, who were on death row, were given the opportunity to atone for some of their sins, by making this data-collecting journey in order to find a new energy source in the black hole before being crushed into the size of a few molecules. The journey doesn't go smoothly, though, because they succumb to cabin fever. For some reason there is a lot of sexual tension, too, although not much sex going on. Too bad! There is reproductive efforts though, led by a doctor who may have killed her own children on Earth. This film is definitely art house and may be too bizarre for most tastes.

323,me-Renee,Terrible Plot/Story. Amazing Everything Else.,5,7 May 2019,"A mesmerizing score, elevated visuals, superb acting, and inspired aesthetic choices still cannot completely make up for this story. I did not see the trailer or read reviews - I watched this based on the cover, the recognizable names, the genre, and the (now I know terribly inaccurate) one-sentence summary. The 'father-daughter struggle to survive isolation in deep space' is beautifully set up as the premise within the first 10 minutes... and then the audience is redirected for 80-90 minutes through a confusing, somber, and slightly sickening display of base instincts unfettered by logical thought or fear of consequences. We return to the initial outline too late and after too much to feel invested. The characters are intriguing but we are not given enough of them; the few sentences offered was like catching glimpses of bright sparkling treasure behind closing doors while being hurried through a dim wide never-ending hallway. I would have gladly watched another hour to find out how the individuals got to where they are. Without that connection, I was instead forcing myself to try to feel connected for curiosity's sake. ""Why am I still watching this? To finish it."" It viewed more as a too-long episode of the Twilight Zone.This was not a movie.

I love cerebral sci-fi/horror and overtly weird movies, so this seemed like my cup of tea.But no. It's horrible on every level except for the general idea and some concepts. But as a movie it effectively destroys itself in the first act alone: overt exposition by tertiary characters that we never see again, forced and cringe inducing dialogue. Bizarre choices of editing, scene-placement and a paletera of secondary characters that have interesting stories but are never explored in any meaningfull way.While the first 20 minutes or so set up an amazing cerebral experience, with a great performance from Pattinson, it quickly desolved into try-hard symbolism that is not just hitting you over the head, but also frustratingly hard to follow.There are some cool shots and moments, but in the end 3/4th of the movie felt as useless nonesense that tries too hard to be edgy.",High Life

330,goodvibes88,Slow with a drifting narrative--but something you've not experienced before,6,24 April 2019,"The negatives:
-The film has a very minimal plot. Things happened without leading to something else, which made it hard fro me to stay engaged. It is lazy story-telling, plain and simple.
-There is a huge amount of joyless and inept exposition that explains why the people are in space. The filmmakers didn't even bother to try and incorporate it in an interesting way. It feels leaden and inept. Shame on the screenwriter!
-The characters are not developed. And because of this lack of development they become one-dimensional and flat. When translates into a boring film.
-The acting is often bad. I am thinking especially of the teenage Willow, who should never have been allowed near this film set. Shame on the director!The positives:
-The scenes with the infant/toddler Willow are great, as is the tension in Robert Pattison's performance as cares for her. I kept thinking that he was going to do something terrible to her. This was the most interesting and captivating part of the film and it happens in the first act. It's all down-hill after that. But at least the filmmakers presented us with these moments that we had never seen before in a sci-fi film.
-The cinematography is exceptionally good, with a lot of shadows and subtleties that looked fantastic on the big screen.
-The art direction feels like a low-budget sci-fi flick. But also like the space agency that made the spaceship was working with limited means (like an old Soviet style). The costumes felt like they came from Tarkovsky's Solaris.All in all, I'm glad I went to see it, for no other reason than to see the toddler and Pattison alone in a space-ship, learning to live, à la Terence Malick's Tree of Life.",High Life

346,Bendransfield,There's more to High Life,9,1 September 2019,"Simply scrolling through reviews will make it clear that this is a polarising film, one that poses a risk to anyone unsure about watching. My advice: take the plunge.Claire Denis is a director who's always proven herself a genius with the critics, but unlike other art filmmakers, has had little luck hitting it off with casual moviegoers.
One thing worth considering before watching is that High Life is never one thing. It waltzes the line between a deeply psychological cosmic horror and an erotic, abstract poem. Think Lovecraft meets Coleridge.Robert Pattinson is worth the short runtime also, he gives a flawless performance and conceals his character in mystery that were thankfully never satisfied away from. High Life isn't supposed to satisfy the audience as much as guide them through a strange and uncomfortable episode of madness and psychological terror in deep space.I'd actually go further to admit this is, in my opinion, the only true and great piece of cosmic horror to grace cinema screens in twenty years. A love of Soviet filmmaker Andrei Tarkovsky is also prevalent throughout, who often used long takes to the extent of claiming filmmaking to be ""sculpting in time"". With this interpretation of filmmaking, High Life becomes a masterpiece. Critical viewers, it's a definite film to add to your watch list. Casual viewe's, if you've made it this far reading my review then give it a watch, it's short and even if you don't like it, I can guarantee it'll teach you a little about human nature as all great films do.

348,anderso-1,"""It's Schopenhauer in space!""",9,2 April 2020,"This movie might not be for everyone. All those one star reviews make that pretty clear. However...For those who are lucky enough to be able to enjoy this movie it's highly rewarding. It's one of those movies that just won't leave your head. For days and days. There's so much to process and appreciate. I had to hit pause halfway through another movie because I couldn't stop thinking about High Life. I came here to try to exorcise it from my mind by babbling about it. I thought making two friends promise to watch it earlier today so that I can talk to them about it next week would be enough but apparently not.Anyway... well acted blah blah blah, clever and beautiful cinematography, et cetera. All that stuff is great but other reviewers have already written everything that needs to be said about it. I want to talk about specifics.Like how Denis uses that recurring detail about having to make a daily report to the life-support system. Did you notice how that's a really clever comment on our political and economic institutions. How did you feel when the captain died and the crew easily solved that problem by cutting that chip from his finger and keeping on making reports. That's just amazing. That's communicating big ideas with small gestures on a well written novel level. I feel like I could have a two hour discussion about that one plot thread. And that's just one example. The movie is full of these unnderstated little details that open up whole worlds when you think about them.It's all incredibly subtle and indirect and maybe that's the problem. Nothing is really spelled out for you and the surface level narrative is just tight enough to keep things moving. With the exception of a few spectacular scenes there's not a whole lot here for viewers who are not prepared to work for the reward. Those scenes are mostly highly off putting anyway so maybe that actually makes things worse for most people. But, if you're one of those lucky viewers who find this movie interesting enough to actively engage with you're in for a real treat. The run time is listed as just under two hours but you'll be replaying this one in your head for ten times that long.Also, I've seen some complaints about the ending even from people who enjoyed the movie as a whole. I can't agree. To me that's the clear heart of the movie. Monte realizes what keeping the species alive would entail. His future offspring would be those puppies on #6. This is obviously not acceptable to a person who puts a premium on humanity and dignity. Better to go along with Willow's plan to fly ""through"" the black hole. One final pure moment together, and then...The final scene also works beautifully with the opening twenty or so minutes of the movie. Looking back on that scene of Willow learning to stand is pretty rough when you realize that she was always doomed. There's so much joy in it though. It's just beautiful. And that's the point I guess. Those moments just might make it all worth it. Compassion and love are beautiful enough to redeem us. We're all doomed but we're certainly not forced to throw human dignity to the wayside and turn to vain immortality quests like Dr. Dibs. We don't have to turn ouurselves into animals. Even in the face of certain doom there is another option. This might be a dark view of human existence but I think it's honest and it leaves the door open for both a sort of grim dignity and a selflesness that are both quite uplifting.tl;dr beautiful, will buy on BR and watch whenever the world gets me down.",High Life
349,stijnverwimp,Stars do not twinkle in space.,4,3 October 2019,"They really don't.
Great shots but personally I don't want to hear a baby scream for 2 hours.
Some of the scenes are just there to shock you.
There were some times where I had an weird lonely feeling that was kind of creepy.
But these moments were scares.",High Life
350,karlieadkisson,Plot could have been great,4,14 October 2021,"To start, I like when movies follow physics and science in general if it's not comical. Obviously not correct. Bodies falling downward plus the tool. That isn't how space works. On that note being open to space you don't have gravity like the main character had when throwing out the bodies.Then the plot had potential but bad execution.",High Life
351,trblesm-18065,Pretentious A.F.,3,7 December 2019,"It's pretty. I'll give it that. The blocking and shot composition are nice. Beyond that, it's a pretentious, void, thoughtless film. It doesn't evoke any real emotion and it drones on and on.....and on...and on.Also, the science is bad. Real bad.",High Life
352,caseyhilton,"Truly, truly terrible.",1,20 July 2019,"I think that it tried to be deep and thought provoking... But it didn't come close to achieving either of those. Unfortunately it was a boring, confusing mess.
Can't blame the actors, they were all solid, and the production values are ok.
I really can't understand how a script like this would ever be made. Why? How did it get financed?
I would rate this film zero stars if I could.",High Life

356,gpwhu,"Oh no Denis, Denis!",1,4 October 2019,"I recall reading an interview with the director after the release of her previous collaboration with Juliette Binoche, 'Let the Sunshine In'. In it she stated that she adores every aspect of the actress but especially her body and her physicality. That adoration is no doubt the reason for the only memorable scene in this film in which JB erotically cavorts in a private 'self-pleasuring' booth atop a shiny steel phallus attached to what looks like one of those bucking-bronco contraptions you get at fairs and rodeos in the US. This, I promise you, is the ONLY memorable scene in 'High Life'.
The rest the film looks as though it was put together by a high school film-making class trying to emulate Tarkovsky's 'Solaris' using some cardboard boxes, glue and sticky-backed plastic. The dialogue tries very hard to be profound but is usually just nasty malevolence and often a usually a prelude to the next violent confrontation of which there are a fair few.
I have enjoyed all the previous films that I've seen by this director so this tedious shambles was rather surprising. She is usually such a clever and knowing film maker but this is an all-round disaster or just possibly - and this is being generous - it could be a crafty exercise in flushing out the most pretentious and dishonest film reviewers. Going by the number of preposterous five-star reviews I have seen she has gone some way in succeeding with that. Unfortunately she hasn't succeeded at much else.",High Life
357,amadiamantes,Mesmerizing,10,7 October 2019,I couldn't look away from the screen throughout the entire film. So much better than I expected. The ending was a bit of a head-scratcher - although I think I understand. Recommend it.,High Life
358,thespewson,Seriously Bad,1,24 April 2019,"First review. Ive wanted to write a review on imdb for some time but never got round to it. I saw High Life last night though and I feel it necessary to just put down some words about it. So here goes...
There is nothing in this fil that is good. Everyone's acting is bad. Robert mumbles most of his lines and the others are just generally poor. The set design is shocking. At no point did I feel like they were in space.... Oh I tell a lie... At the beginning he takes off a glove that starts to float around... That's the only bit of weightlessness in the film. Every other scene has perfect gravity. It even tries to explain why there is gravity later on... So why show a glove floating around??? If you like realism in your sci-fi then this is not the film for you.
Honestly one of the worst films ever.",High Life
